The relationship management was situated in assorted media: web sites, newsletters, developer conferences, trade media, blogs and DVD distribution.\nStarting in January 2020, the website was fully integrated with Microsoft Docs (itself integrated into Microsoft Learn in 2022).\nWebsites.\nMSDN's primary web presence at \"msdn.microsoft.com\" was a collection of sites for the developer community that provided information, documentation, and discussion that was authored both by Microsoft and by the community at large. Microsoft later began placing emphasis on incorporation of forums, blogs, library annotations and social bookmarking to make MSDN an open dialog with the developer community rather than a one-way service. The main website, and most of its constituent applications below were available in 56 or more languages.\nLibrary.\nMSDN Library was a library of official technical documentation intended for independent developers of software for Microsoft Windows. MSDN Library documented the APIs that ship with Microsoft products and also included sample code, technical articles, and other programming information. The library was freely available on the web, with CDs and DVDs of the most recent materials initially issued quarterly as part of an MSDN subscription. However, beginning in 2006, they were available to be freely downloaded from Microsoft Download Center in the form of ISO images. \nVisual Studio Express edition integrated only with MSDN Express Library, which was a subset of the full MSDN Library, although either edition of the MSDN Library could be freely downloaded and installed standalone.\nIn Visual Studio 2010 MSDN Library was replaced with the new Help System, which was installed as a part of Visual Studio 2010 installation. Help Library Manager was used to install Help Content books covering selected topics.\nIn 2016, Microsoft introduced the new technical documentation platform, Microsoft Docs, intended as a replacement of the TechNet and MSDN libraries. Over the next two years, the content of the MSDN Library was gradually migrated into Microsoft Docs. In 2022, Microsoft Docs was itself incorporated into Microsoft Learn. MSDN Library pages now redirect to the corresponding Microsoft Learn pages.\nIntegration with Visual Studio.\nEach edition of MSDN Library could only be accessed with one help viewer (Microsoft Document Explorer or other help viewer), which was integrated with the \"then current\" single version or sometimes two versions of Visual Studio. In addition, each new version of Visual Studio did not integrate with an earlier version of MSDN. A compatible MSDN Library was released with each new version of Visual Studio and included on the Visual Studio DVD. As newer versions of Visual Studio were released, newer editions of MSDN Library did not integrate with older Visual Studio versions and did not even include old/obsolete documentation for deprecated or discontinued products. MSDN Library versions could be installed side-by-side, that is, both the older as well as the newer versions of MSDN Library could co-exist.\nForums.\nMSDN Forums were the web-based forums used by the community to discuss a wide variety of software development topics. MSDN Forums were migrated to an all-new platform during 2008 that provided new features designed to improve efficiency such as inline preview of threads, AJAX filtering, and a slide-up post editor.\nBlogs.\nMSDN blogs was a series of blogs that were hosted under Microsoft's domain codice_1. Some blogs were dedicated to a product \u2013 e.g. Visual Studio, Internet Explorer, PowerShell \u2013 or a version of a product \u2013 e.g. Windows 7, Windows 8 \u2013 while others belonged to a Microsoft employee, e.g. Michael Howard or Raymond Chen. In May 2020, the MSDN and TechNet blogs were closed and the content was archived at Microsoft Docs.\nSocial bookmarking.\nSocial bookmarking on MSDN Social was first launched in 2008, built on a new web platform that had user-tagging and feeds at its core. The goal of the social bookmarking application was to provide a method whereby members of the developer community could:\nThe initial release of the application provided standard features for the genre, including a bookmarklet and import capabilities. The MSDN web site was also starting to incorporate feeds of social bookmarks from experts and the community, displayed alongside feeds from relevant bloggers.\nThe social bookmarking feature was discontinued on October 1, 2009.\nGallery.\nMSDN Gallery was a repository of community-authored code samples and projects. Launched in 2008, the purpose of the site evolved to complement Codeplex, the open-source project hosting site from Microsoft. MSDN Gallery was retired in 2002 and all MSDN pages now redirect to the new code samples experience on Microsoft Learn.\nSoftware subscriptions.\nMSDN had historically offered a subscription package whereby developers had access and licenses to use nearly all Microsoft software that had ever been released to the public. Subscriptions were sold on an annual basis, and cost anywhere from US$1,000 to US$6,000 per year per subscription, as it was offered in several tiers.\nAlthough in most cases the software itself functioned exactly like the full product, the MSDN end-user license agreement prohibited use of the software in a business production environment. This was a legal restriction, not a technical one. An exception was made for Microsoft Office, allowing personal use \"even for business purposes\" without a separate license\u2014but only with the \"MSDN Premium Subscription\" and even so only \"directly related to the design, development and test and/or documentation of software projects;\" this \"does not terminate\"\n\"MSDN Magazine\".\nMicrosoft provided editorial content for \"MSDN Magazine\", a monthly publication. The magazine was created as a merger between \"Microsoft Systems Journal\" (MSJ) and \"Microsoft Internet Developer\" (MIND) magazines in March 2000.\nMSJ back issues were available online. \"MSDN Magazine\" was available as a print magazine in the United States, and online in 11 languages. The last issue of the magazine was released in November 2019.\nMicrosoft Systems Journal.\nMicrosoft Systems Journal was a 1986-founded bi-monthly Microsoft magazine.\nHistory.\nMSDN was launched in September 1992 as a quarterly, CD-ROM-based compilation of technical articles, sample code, and software development kits. The first two MSDN CD releases (September 1992 and January 1993) were marked as pre-release discs (P1 and P2, respectively). Disc 3, released in April 1993, was the first full release. In addition to CDs, there was a 16-page tabloid newspaper, \"Microsoft Developer Network News\", edited by Andrew Himes, who had previously been the founding editor of MacTech, the premiere Macintosh technology journal. A Level II subscription was added in 1993, that included the MAPI, ODBC, TAPI and VFW SDKs.\nMSDN2 was opened in November 2004 as a source for Visual Studio 2005 API information, with noteworthy differences being updated web site code, conforming better to web standards and thus giving a long-awaited improved support for alternative web browsers to Internet Explorer in the API browser. In 2008, the original MSDN cluster was retired and MSDN2 became msdn.microsoft.com.\nDr GUI and the MSDN Writers Team.\nIn 1996, Bob Gunderson began writing a column in \"Microsoft Developer Network News\", edited by Andrew Himes, using the pseudonym \"Dr.GUI\". The column provided answers to questions submitted by MSDN subscribers. The caricature of Dr. GUI was based on a photo of Gunderson. When he left the MSDN team, Dennis Crain took over the Dr. GUI role and added medical humor to the column. Upon his departure, Dr. GUI became the composite identity of the original group (most notably Paul Johns) of Developer Technology Engineers that provided in-depth technical articles to the Library. The early members included: Bob Gunderson, Dale Rogerson, R\u00fcdiger R. Asche, Ken Lassesen, Nigel Thompson (a.k.a. Herman Rodent), Nancy Cluts, Paul Johns, Dennis Crain, and Ken Bergmann. Nigel Thompson was the development manager for Windows Multimedia Extensions that originally added multimedia capabilities to Windows. Renan Jeffreis produced the original system (Panda) to publish MSDN on the Internet and in HTML instead of the earlier multimedia viewer engine. Dale Rogerson, Nigel Thompson and Nancy Cluts all published MS Press books while on the MSDN team. As of August 2010, only Dennis Crain and Dale Rogerson remain employed by Microsoft.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Christian conservatives seek to influence politics and public policy with their interpretation of the teachings of Christianity.\nIn the United States, the Christian right (otherwise known as the \"New Christian Right\" or the \"Religious Right\") is an informal coalition which was formed around a core of conservative Evangelical Protestants and conservative Roman Catholics. The Christian right draws additional support from politically conservative mainline Protestants, Orthodox Jews, and Mormons. The movement in American politics became a dominant feature of U.S. conservatism from the late 1970s onwards. The Christian right gained powerful influence within the Republican Party during the Presidency of Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Its influence draws from grassroots activism as well as from focus on social issues and the ability to motivate the electorate around those issues.\nThe Christian right has advanced socially conservative positions on issues such as creationism in public education, school prayer, temperance, Christian nationalism, and Sunday Sabbatarianism, as well as opposition to the teaching of biological evolution, secularism, LGBTQ rights, abortion, euthanasia, pornography, embryonic stem cell research, and the use of drugs. Although the term \"Christian right\" is most commonly associated with U.S. politics, similar Christian conservative groups can be found in the political cultures of other Christian-majority countries.\nTerminology.\nIn the United States, the Christian right is otherwise known as the \"New Christian Right\" (NCR) or the \"Religious Right\", although some consider the religious right to be \"a slightly broader category than Christian Right\".\nJohn C. Green of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life states that Jerry Falwell used the label \"religious right\" to describe himself. Gary Schneeberger, vice president of media and public relations for Focus on the Family, states that \"[t]erms like 'religious right' have been traditionally used in a pejorative way to suggest extremism. The phrase 'socially conservative evangelicals' is not very exciting, but that's certainly the way to do it.\"\nEvangelical Protestant leaders like Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council have called attention to the problem of equating the term \"Christian right\" with Evangelical Christianity. Although Evangelicals constitute the core constituency of the Christian right, not all Evangelicals fit the description, and a number of Roman Catholics are also members of the Christian right's core base. The problem of description is further complicated by the fact that the label \"religious conservative\" or \"conservative Christian\" may apply to other religious groups as well. For instance, Anabaptist Christians (most notably Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, the Bruderhof Communities, Schwarzenau Brethren, River Brethren, and Apostolic Christians) are theologically, socially, and culturally conservative; however, there are no overtly political organizations associated with these Christian denominations, which are usually uninvolved, uninterested, apathetic, or indifferent towards politics. Evangelical theologian and pastor Tim Keller stated that conservative Christianity (theology) predates the Christian right (politics). Keller asserted that being a theological conservative does not require a person to be a political conservative, and that some political progressive views around economics, helping the poor, the redistribution of wealth, and racial diversity are compatible with theologically conservative Christianity. Conservative writer Rod Dreher has stated that a Christian can be theologically conservative while still holding left-wing economic views or even socialist views.\nHistory.\nBackground and predecessors.\nIn 1863, representatives from eleven Christian denominations in the United States organized the National Reform Association. The organization's goal was to amend the U.S. Constitution to make the country a Christian state. The National Reform Association is one of the first organizations through which adherents from several Christian denominations worked together in an attempt to enshrine Christianity in American governance. The Christian Civic League of Maine (founded in 1897), and other early organizations of the Christian right, supported the aims of the temperance movement. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, there were also a number of Evangelical Protestants who supported progressive causes. The Scopes trial in 1925 reportedly resulted in most Evangelicals abandoning the political arena in an organized fashion. An Evangelical political subculture emerged, largely isolated from the outside world, consisting of various organizations that laid the groundwork for the Christian right in the late 1970s.\nWhile the beginning of the influence of the Christian right is typically traced to the late 1970s, Daniel K. Williams argues in \"God's Own Party\" that it had actually been involved in politics for most of the twentieth century. He also notes that the Christian right had previously been in alliance with the Republican Party in the 1940s through 1960s on matters such as opposition to communism and defending \"a Protestant-based moral order\". Similarly, scholar Celestini Carmen traces the John Birch Society (JBS)'s focus on culture war issues and rhetoric of apocalypticism, conspiracism, and fear to the rise of the Christian right through JBS members and Christian rightist activists Tim LaHaye, Phyllis Schlafly, and others.\nIn light of the state atheism espoused by communist countries aligned with the Eastern Bloc during the height of the Cold War (1950s\u20131960s), secularization came to be seen by many Americans sympathetic to proto-Christian right narratives as the biggest threat to American and Christian values. These fears resulted in a number of actions by the U.S. federal government throughout the 1950s, including the establishment of the National Day of Prayer, the addition of the motto \"In God We Trust\" to U.S. currency, and the addition of the phrase \"Under God\" to the Pledge of Allegiance. The alienation of Southern Democrats from the Democratic Party contributed to the rise of the right, as the counterculture of the 1960s provoked fear of social disintegration amongst many conservatives. In addition, as the Democratic Party became identified with progressive and liberal policies, social conservatives joined the Republican Party in increasing numbers. Despite these trends, many White Evangelicals remained politically inactive and were not a unified voting bloc, with many on the Evangelical left believing political activism and engagement to be inconsistent with their beliefs.\nEarly history and rise, 1970s\u20131980s.\nThe movement that would become the Christian right had much of its origin in the work and activism of conservative operative Paul Weyrich, who had foreseen the potential to organize conservative Evangelicals and Roman Catholics into a political force in the early 1960s and had reportedly started trying to do so during the 1964 U.S. Presidential election. Weyrich tried a number of wedge issues throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, including abortion, pornography, the proposed Equal Rights Amendment, and school prayer, without success. Weyrich was not successful until the legality of segregation academies began to be challenged in the early 1970s. In 1970, the Internal Revenue Service adopted a policy of rescinding the tax-exempt status of private schools that did not admit African\u2013American students, and the following year, the Supreme Court ruled in \"Coit v. Green\" that organizations that voluntarily practice racial discrimination are not eligible for tax exemption. The origin of this case was a legal challenge to the tax-exempt status of a group of segregation academies in Holmes County, Mississippi. Many of the schools targeted by these rulings were church-sponsored, and these actions reportedly caught the attention of a number of evangelical leaders, including Jerry Falwell. The largest educational institution targeted by the IRS was Bob Jones University, which lost its tax exemption in 1976 due to its policy prohibiting interracial dating. This action reportedly further caught the ire of evangelical leaders, many of whom believed that the IRS was overstepping its legal authority. Weyrich also sought to frame the IRS crackdown on segregation academics as an issue of government intrusion and attacks on religious freedom, effectively diverting attention from the racial aspect of the issue.\nDuring the 1976 U.S. Presidential election, Jimmy Carter, who described himself as an Evangelical, born-again Christian, received the support of a majority of American evangelicals and the emerging Christian right largely because of his much-acclaimed religious conversion. However, the issue of segregation academies carried over into Carter's presidency, and in 1978, the IRS proposed a new rule that would have revoked the tax exemption of private schools based on their racial demographic composition relative to that of their respective communities. While this rule never went into effect, it provoked fierce backlash and protests from evangelical leaders and church congregants alike, with many believing it to be an attack on non-discriminatory institutions and religious freedom. The IRS reportedly received over 150,000 letters in opposition to this proposal, mostly from Christians. This action reportedly encouraged many white evangelicals to become politically active for the first time, and turned them against Jimmy Carter. Weyrich later stated that what got evangelicals involved in politics was \"Jimmy Carter's intervention against the Christian schools, trying to deny them tax-exempt status on the basis of so-called de facto segregation\", and Richard Viguerie said that the 1978 IRS action \"kicked a sleeping dog.\" Others, including religious right leader Ed Dobson and conservative activist Grover Norquist have affirmed this as the beginnings of the religious right.\nAround the same time, Weyrich realized that support for segregation academies was not viable and began to look for other issues. The unexpected success of predominantly Catholic anti-abortion activists in the 1978 midterms convinced Weyrich that opposition to abortion might work as a wedge issue to keep evangelicals politically mobilized. He favored the issue because it could be framed in the context of family values and be used to claim moral superiority, as well as attack second-wave feminism. Prior to this time, the Catholic Church was the only Christian denomination that was staunchly anti-abortion, with many Protestant and evangelical denominations, including the Southern Baptist Convention, either supporting the legalization of the procedure in some circumstances, or not taking a stance on the issue. The following year, filmmaker Frank Schaeffer produced a series of anti-abortion films titled \"Whatever Happened to the Human Race?\", starring his father, evangelist Francis Schaeffer and pediatric surgeon Dr. C. Everett Koop. That same year, abortion was reportedly suggested as a wedge issue during a conference call between a number of religious right leaders, although many were still skeptical of its ability to mobilize evangelicals. Schaeffer's films were also reportedly met with tepid reception during a tour in which they were shown at numerous churches around the United States, and leaders like Jerry Falwell were initially hesitant to utilize abortion, believing that its stereotype amongst evangelicals as a \"Catholic issue\" would hinder its ability to politically mobilize them. It was not until the early 1980s that abortion would become in effect the signature wedge issue of the religious right, and conservative evangelicals began joining the anti-abortion movement in large numbers.\nIn 1979, the Moral Majority, widely considered the first religious right organization, was founded by Falwell, Weyrich, and other associates and began emphasizing such issues as abortion, pornography, gay rights, and opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment, and a perceived moral decline of the United States, and played a major role in mobilizing evangelicals to support Ronald Reagan in the 1980 United States presidential election. In response to the rise of the Christian right, the 1980 Republican Party platform assumed a number of its positions, including the resumption of public school prayer. While the platform also opposed abortion, leaned towards restricting taxpayer funding for abortions, and sought a constitutional amendment bestowing personhood to fetuses, it also acknowledged the fact that many Americans, including Republicans, were divided on the issue. At this time, both major political parties were divided internally on abortion rights, and it was not until the late 1980s that abortion came to be viewed as a partisan issue. Throughout his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan said that if he were stranded on a desert island he would want the Bible, promised religious leaders that he wouldn't let the IRS interfere with Christian schools, questioned the legitimacy of evolution and suggested that creationism should also be taught, and encouraged evangelicals to become more politically active. Against the backdrop of \"Bob Jones University v. United States\", Reagan's DOJ informed the supreme court \"that the Administration was dropping its opposition to lawsuits brought by the Bob Jones and Goldsboro schools, seeking restoration of their tax-exempt status.\" Reagan's administration defended the move by arguing that the denial of tax-exempt status was up to congress. After a backlash from critics, Reagan proposed legislation that would deny tax-exempt status to segregated schools, but congress never passed the legislation, believing that the IRS already had this authority. Over the next two decades, Christian rightist citizens became more politically active in a time period labeled the New Christian Right. In addition to the \"Moral Majority\" (which dissolved in the late 1980s), the Christian right was associated with new organizations throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including the Christian Coalition of America, Focus on the Family, the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Family Research Council, and the American Center for Law &amp; Justice.\nLater history, 1990s to present.\nWriting in 2016, Patricia Miller states that the \"alliance between evangelical leaders and the Catholic bishops has been a cornerstone of the Christian Right for nearly twenty years\". \nSince its inception, the Christian right has engaged in battles over abortion, euthanasia, contraception, pornography, gambling, obscenity, Christian nationalism, Sabbatarianism (concerning Sunday blue laws), state-sanctioned public school prayer, public school textbook inclusion of creationism (if not prohibition on teaching mainstream evolutionary science), LGBTQ rights, and sexual education. Ralph Reed, the chairman of the Christian Coalition, stated that the 1988 presidential campaign of Pat Robertson was the \"political crucible\" that led to the proliferation of Christian right groups in the United States. The Christian right is perhaps best known for its alliance with the U.S. anti-abortion movement and its efforts to overturn the 1973 \"Roe v Wade\" ruling, which established abortion as a constitutionally protected right in the U.S. Changing political contexts led to the Christian right's advocacy for other issues, such as opposition to euthanasia and campaigning for abstinence-only sex education.\nIn the 2016 presidential election, the Christian right supported Donald Trump, who promised to appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn \"Roe v Wade\". Many evangelicals were initially hesitant to support Trump due to his character flaws and lack of religiosity. Trump ultimately appointed three justices to the Supreme Court, all of whom voted to overturn the 1973 decision in \"Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization\" in 2022. Trump's support amongst evangelicals has also been attributed by some, including journalist Tim Alberta, to a fear that white evangelicals and evangelicalism, if not Christianity more broadly, are losing their political power. Since the 1990s, the share of Americans who identify as Christian has declined, part of a larger decline of Christianity in the Western world. Alberta, and others, have argued that many white evangelicals see Trump as a savior figure, and that his rhetoric about returning the United States to a perceived state of former greatness, embodied by his campaign slogan \"Make America Great Again\", resonates strongly with them. In addition to their declining numbers, many have also reported a fear of an increasingly secularizing world, which some scholars and commentators have argued led them to embrace Trumpism. On many occasions, Trump has stated that he believes Christianity is under attack in the United States. Trump continued to receive strong support from the Christian right in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. Since the 2010s, the Christian right has increasingly supported other measures targeting the separation of church and state, including school vouchers and efforts to integrate the Christian Bible and the Ten Commandments into public school curricula. By the 2020s, the Christian right has increasingly been influenced by Christian nationalism. \nOrganizational ability.\nGrassroots activism.\nThe Christian right wields significant influence in American politics due to their high voter turnout and strong motivation to support right-wing candidates. They actively participate in political events, canvassing and distributing literature without needing financial compensation, driven by their devotion to the cause.\nPolitical leaders and institutions.\nLed by Robert Grant's advocacy group Christian Voice, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, Ed McAteer's Religious Roundtable Council, James Dobson's Focus on the Family, Paul Weyrich's Free Congress Research and Education Foundation, and the Heritage Foundation, and Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, the new Christian right combined conservative politics with evangelical and fundamentalist religion. The birth of the new Christian right, however, is usually traced to a 1979 meeting wherein televangelist Jerry Falwell was urged to create a \"Moral Majority\" organization. In 1979, Weyrich was in a discussion with Falwell when he remarked that there was a \"moral majority\" of Americans ready to be called to political action. Weyrich later recalled in a 2007 interview with the \"Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\" that after he mentioned the term \"moral majority\", Falwell \"turned to his people and said, 'That's the name of our organization.'\"\nWeyrich would then engineer a strong union between the Republican Party and many culturally conservative Christians. Soon, \"moral majority\" became a general term for the conservative political activism of evangelicals and fundamentalists such as Pat Robertson, James Robison, and Jerry Falwell. Howard Schweber, professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, writes that \"in the past two decades\", \"Catholic politicians have emerged as leading figures in the religious conservative movement.\"\nInstitutions in the United States.\nNational organizations.\nAn early attempt to bring the Christian right into American politics began in 1974 when Robert Grant, a movement leader, who founded the American Christian Cause to advocate Christian ideological teachings in Southern California. Concerned that Christians overwhelmingly voted for President Jimmy Carter in 1976, Grant founded Christian Voice to rally Christian voters behind socially conservative candidates. Prior to his alliance with Falwell, Weyrich sought an alliance with Grant. Grant and other Christian Voice staff soon set up their main office at the headquarters of Weyrich's Heritage Foundation. The alliance between Weyrich and Grant fell apart in 1978.\nIn the late 1980s, Pat Robertson founded the Christian Coalition of America, building from his 1988 presidential run, with Republican activist Ralph Reed, who became the spokesman for the Coalition. In 1992, the national Christian Coalition, Inc., headquartered in Virginia Beach, Virginia, began producing voter guides, which it distributed to conservative Christian churches, both Protestant and Catholic, with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. Under the leadership of Reed and Robertson, the Coalition quickly became the most prominent voice in the conservative Christian movement, its influence culminating with an effort to support the election of a conservative Christian to the presidency in 1996. In addition, they have encouraged the convergence of conservative Christian ideology with political issues, such as healthcare, the economy, education and crime.\nPolitical activists lobbied within the Republican party locally and nationally to influence party platforms and nominations. More recently James Dobson's group Focus on the Family, based in Colorado Springs, and the Family Research Council in Washington D.C. have gained enormous respect from Republican lawmakers. While strongly advocating for these ideological matters, Dobson himself is warier of the political spectrum and much of the resources of his group are devoted to other aims such as media. However, as a private citizen, Dobson has stated his opinion on presidential elections; on February 5, 2008, Dobson issued a statement regarding the 2008 presidential election and his strong disappointment with the Republican party's candidates.\nIn an essay written in 1996, Ralph Reed argued against the moral absolutist tone of Christian right leaders, arguing for the Republican Party Platform to stress the moral dimension of abortion rather than placing emphasis on overturning Roe v. Wade. Reed believes that pragmatism is the best way to advocate for the Christian right.\nPartisan activity of churches.\nOvertly partisan actions by churches could threaten their 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status due to the Johnson Amendment of the Internal Revenue Code. In one notable example, the former pastor of the East Waynesville Baptist Church in Waynesville, North Carolina \"told the congregation that anyone who planned to vote for Democratic Sen. John Kerry should either leave the church or repent\". The church later expelled nine members who had voted for Kerry and refused to repent, which led to criticism on the national level. The pastor resigned and the ousted church members were allowed to return.\nThe Alliance Defense Fund, a Christian right group now known as the Alliance Defending Freedom, started the Pulpit Freedom Initiative in 2008. ADF states that \"[t]he goal of Pulpit Freedom Sunday is simple: have the Johnson Amendment declared unconstitutional \u2013 and once and for all remove the ability of the IRS to censor what a pastor says from the pulpit.\"\nElectoral activity.\nBoth Christian right and secular polling organizations sometimes conduct polls to determine which presidential candidates will receive the support of Christian right constituents. One such poll is taken at the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit. George W. Bush's electoral success owed much to his overwhelming support from white evangelical voters, who comprise 23% of the vote. In 2000 he received 68% of the white evangelical vote; in 2004 that percentage rose to 78%. In 2016, Donald Trump received 81% of the white evangelical vote.\nEducation.\nThe Home School Legal Defense Association was co-founded in 1983 by Michael Farris, who would later establish Generation Joshua and Patrick Henry College, and Michael Smith. This organization attempts to challenge laws that serve as obstacles to allowing parents to home-school their children and to organize the disparate group of homeschooling families into a cohesive bloc. The number of homeschooling families has increased in the last twenty years, and around 80 percent of these families identify themselves as evangelicals.\nThe main universities associated with the Christian right in the United States are:\nMedia.\nThe media has played a major role in the rise of the Christian right since the 1920s and has continued to be a powerful force for political Christianity today. The role of the media for the Religious right has been influential in its ability to connect Christian audiences to the larger American culture while at the same time bringing and keeping religion into play as both a political and a cultural force. The political agenda of the Christian right has been disseminated to the public through a variety of media outlets including radio broadcasting, television, and literature.\nReligious broadcasting began in the 1920s through the radio. Between the 1950s and 1980s, TV became a powerful way for the Christian right to influence the public through shows such as Pat Robertson's \"The 700 Club\" and The Family Channel (now Freeform). The Internet has also helped the Christian right reach a much larger audience. These organizations' websites play a strong role in popularising the Christian right's stances on cultural and political issues, and inform interested viewers on how to get involved. For example, the Christian Coalition of America has used the Internet to inform the public, as well as to sell merchandise and gather members.\nViews.\nCapital punishment.\nSupport for the death penalty has divided Catholics and Evangelical Protestants within the Christian Right: The Roman Catholic Church is against capital punishment, while the Southern Baptist Convention and the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod support it. Certain conservative Catholics, however, have supported the death penalty. The Moral Majority made strong support for capital punishment part of its socially conservative agenda. Surveys have found that Evangelical Protestants are more likely than any other American religious group to favor the death penalty.\nEducation.\nThe Christian right strongly advocates for a system of educational choice, using a system of school vouchers, instead of public education. Vouchers would be government funded and could be redeemed for \"a specified maximum sum per child per years if spent on approved educational services\". This method would allow parents to determine which school their child attends while relieving the economic burden associated with private schools. The concept is popular among constituents of church-related schools, including those affiliated with Evangelical Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism.\nEvolution.\nThe Protestant members of the Christian right in the United States generally promote the teaching of creationism and intelligent design as opposed to, or alongside, biological evolution. Some supporters of the Christian right have opposed the teaching of evolution in the past, but they did not have the ability to stop it being taught in public schools as was done during the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, in which a science teacher went on trial for teaching about the subject of evolution in a public school. Other \"Christian right organizations supported the teaching of creationism, along with evolution, in public schools\", specifically promoting theistic evolution (also known as evolutionary creationism) in which God is regarded as the originator of the process.\nMembers of and organizations associated with the Christian right, such as the Discovery Institute, created and popularized the modern concept of intelligent design, which became widely known only with the publication of the book \"Of Pandas and People\" in 1989. The Discovery Institute, through their intelligent design initiative called the \"Center for Science and Culture\", has endorsed the teach the controversy approach. According to its proponents, such an approach would ensure that both the strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary theory were discussed in the curriculum. This tactic was criticized by Judge John E. Jones III in \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\", describing it as \"at best disingenuous, and at worst a canard.\"\nThe overwhelming majority of scientific research, both in the United States and elsewhere, has concluded that the theory of evolution, using the technical definition of the word theory, is the only viable explanation of the development of life, and an overwhelming majority of biologists strongly support its presentation in public school science classes. Outside the United States, as well as among American Catholics and Mainline Protestants, Christian conservatives have generally come to accept the theory of evolution.\nSex education.\nSome Christian groups advocate for the removal of sex education literature from public schools, for parental opt-out of comprehensive sex education, or for abstinence-only sex education. Sam Harris has written that thirty percent of America's sex-education programs are abstinence based and ineffective.\nSchooling.\nThe Christian right promotes homeschooling and private schooling as a valid alternative to public education for parents who object to the content being taught at school. The percentage of children being homeschooled rose from 1.7% of the student population in 1999 to 2.2% in 2003, and much of this increase has been attributed to the desire to incorporate Christian teachings into the curriculum. In 2003, 72% of parents who homeschooled their children cited the ability to provide religious or moral instruction as the reason for removing their children from public schools. The \"Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District\" case established that creationism cannot be taught in public schools, and in response officials have increasingly appropriated public funds for charter schools that teach curricula like Accelerated Christian Education.\nSunday Sabbatarianism.\nThe Christian right is in favor of legislation that maintains and promotes Sunday Sabbatarianism, such as Sunday blue laws that forbid shopping and restrict the sale of alcohol on Sundays, which is the Lord's Day in mainstream Christianity.\nRole of government.\nSupporters of the Christian right have no one unified stance on the role of government since the movement is primarily one that advocates social conservatism; in fact, \"struggles [have] broken out in state party organizations\" between supporters of the Christian right and other conservatives. It promotes conservative interpretations of the Bible as the basis for moral values and enforcing such values by legislation. Evangelical Christians have generally supported laissez-faire economic policies since the New Deal era, while Catholics alternatively accept the Catholic Church's strong support for labor unions.\nChurch and state relations.\nThe Christian right believes that separation of church and state is not explicit in the American Constitution, believing instead that such separation is a creation of what it claims are activist judges in the judicial system. In the United States, the Christian right often supports their claims by stating that the country was \"founded by Christians as a Christian Nation.\" Members of the Christian right take the position that the Establishment Clause bars the federal government from establishing or sponsoring a state church (e.g., the Church of England), but does not prevent the government from acknowledging religion. The Christian right points out that the term \"separation of church and state\" is derived from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson, not from the Constitution itself. Furthermore, the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) takes the view that the concept of \"separation of church and state\" has been used by the American Civil Liberties Union and its allies to inhibit public acknowledgment of Christianity and restrict the religious freedoms of Christians.\nThus, Christian right leaders have argued that the Establishment Clause does not prohibit the display of religion in the public sphere. Leaders, therefore, believe that public institutions should be allowed, or even required, to display the Ten Commandments. This interpretation has been repeatedly rejected by the courts, which have found that such displays violate the Establishment Clause. Public officials though are prohibited from using their authority in which the primary effect is \"advancing or prohibiting religion\", according to the Lemon Supreme Court test, and there cannot be an \"excessive entanglement with religion\" and the government. Some, such as Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association, argue that the First Amendment, which specifically restricts Congress, applies only to the Congress and not the states. This position rejects the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.\nGenerally, the Christian right supports the presence of religious institutions within government and the public sphere, and advocates for fewer restrictions on government funding for religious charities and schools. Both Catholics and Protestants, according to a 2005 Gallup study, have been supportive of school prayer in public schools.\nEconomics.\nEarly American fundamentalists, such as John R. Rice often favored \"laissez-faire\" economics and were outspoken critics of the New Deal and later the Great Society. The contemporary Christian right supports economic conservative policies such as tax cuts and social conservative policies such as child tax credits.\nZionism.\nMany evangelical Protestant supporters of the religious right have strongly supported Christian Zionism and the state of Israel in recent decades, encouraging support for Israel within the United States government. Some of them have linked Israel to Biblical prophesies; for example, Ed McAteer, founder of the Moral Majority, said \"I believe that we are seeing prophecy unfold so rapidly and dramatically and wonderfully and, without exaggerating, makes me breathless.\" This belief, an example of dispensationalism, arises from the idea that the establishment of Israel is a prerequisite for the Second Coming of Jesus, because it represents the Biblically prophesied Gathering of Israel. A 2017 poll indicates that this belief is held by 80% of evangelicals, and that half of evangelicals consider it an important cause of their support for the state of Israel. However, other Protestant churches and Christian right ideologues have rejected a religious basis for Zionism and condemned the ideology.\nAbortion and contraception.\nHistorically, large percentages of American Catholics and Evangelical Protestants oppose and have opposed abortion, believing that life begins at conception and that abortion is murder. Therefore, those in the movement have worked toward the overturning of \"Roe v. Wade (1973)\", and \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" (1992). The Christian right has also supported incremental steps to make abortion less available. Such efforts include bans on late-term abortion (including intact dilation and extraction), prohibitions against Medicaid funding and other public funding for elective abortions, removal of taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortion services, legislation requiring parental consent or notification for abortions performed on minors, legal protections for unborn victims of violence, legal protections for infants born alive following failed abortions, and bans on abortifacient medications.\nThe Christian right element in the Reagan coalition strongly supported him in 1980, in the belief that he would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn \"Roe v. Wade\". They were astonished and dismayed when his first appointment was Sandra Day O'Connor, whom they feared would tolerate abortion. They worked hard to defeat her confirmation but failed.\nThe Christian right contends that morning-after pills such as Plan B and Ella are possible abortifacients, able to interfere with a fertilized egg's implantation in the uterine wall. The labeling mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Plan B and Ella state that they may interfere with implantation, but according to a June 2012, \"The New York Times\" article, many scientists believe that they work only by interfering with ovulation and are arguing to have the implantation language removed from product labels. The Christian right maintains that the chemical properties of morning-after pills make them abortifacients and that the politics of abortion is influencing scientific judgments. Jonathan Imbody of the Christian Medical Association says he questions \"whether ideological considerations are driving these decisions.\" Specifically, many Catholic members, as well as some conservative Protestant members, of the Christian right have campaigned against contraception altogether.\nIn May 2022, \"Politico\" published a leaked draft majority opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito. It would overturn \"Roe\" and \"Casey\" by nullifying the specific privacy rights in question, eliminating federal involvement, and leaving the issue to be determined by the states. Through a statement made by the Chief Justice of the United States, John Roberts, the Court confirmed the document's authenticity but said that it was not a final decision or the Justice's final decision, which was expected by June or July.\nThe decision was issued on June 24, 2022, ruling 6\u20133 to reverse the lower court rulings; a more narrow 5\u20134 ruling overturned \"Roe\" and \"Casey\". The majority opinion stated that abortion was not a constitutional right, and that states should have discretion in regulating abortion. The majority opinion, written by Alito, was substantially similar to the leaked draft. Chief Justice Roberts agreed with the judgment upholding the Mississippi law but did not join the majority in the opinion to overturn \"Roe\" and \"Casey\".\nBiotechnology.\nDue to the Christian right's views regarding ethics and to an extent due to negative views of eugenics common to most ideologies in North America, it has worked for the regulation and restriction of certain applications of biotechnology. In particular, the Christian right opposes therapeutic and reproductive human cloning, championing a 2005 United Nations ban on the practice, and human embryonic stem cell research, which involves the extraction of one or more cells from a human embryo. The Christian right supports research with adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells which do not use cells from human embryos, as they view the harvesting of biological material from an embryo lacking the ability to give permission as an assault on a living being.\nThe Christian right also opposes euthanasia, and, in one highly publicized case, took an active role in seeking governmental intervention to prevent Terri Schiavo from being deprived of nutrition and hydration.\nOpposition to drugs.\nThe Christian right has historically supported the temperance movement, thus supporting causes such as maintaining Sunday blue laws, adding alcohol packaging warning messages to bottles and limiting alcohol advertising. It has advocated for the prohibition of drugs and has opposed efforts to legalize marijuana. However, the Roman Catholic Church in Canada is in support of medical marijuana for therapeutic reasons.\nSex and sexuality.\nThe modern roots of the Christian right's views on sexual matters were evident in the years 1950s\u20131960s, a period in which many conservative Christians in the United States viewed sexual promiscuity as not only excessive, but in fact as a threat to their ideal vision of the country. Beginning in the 1970s, conservative Christian protests against promiscuity began to surface, largely as a reaction to the \"permissive Sixties\" and changes in sexual behavior confirmed by \"Roe v. Wade\" and the LGBT rights movement. The Christian right proceeded to make sexuality issues a priority political cause.\nAnita Bryant organized Save Our Children, a widespread campaign to oppose legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The group argued that gay people were \"recruiting\" or \"molesting children\" in order to make them gay. Bryant said, \"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children,\" and also said that \"If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to people who sleep with St. Bernards and to nail biters.\" The Bryant campaign achieved success in repealing some city anti-discrimination laws, and proposed other citizen initiatives such as a failed California ballot question designed to ban gay people or those who supported LGBT rights from holding public teaching jobs. Bryant's campaign attracted widespread opposition and boycotts which put her out of business.\nFrom the late 1970s onwards, some conservative Christian organizations such as the Christian Broadcasting Network, Focus on the Family, Concerned Women for America, the American Family Association, and the Christian Coalition of America, along with right-wing Christian hate groups such as the Westboro Baptist Church, have been outspoken against LGBT rights. Late in 1979, a new religious revival among conservative Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics ushered in the Republican coalition politically aligned with the Christian right that would reign in the United States between the years 1970s and 1980s, becoming another obstacle for the progress of the LGBTQ rights movement. During the HIV/AIDS epidemic of the 1980s, LGBTQ communities were further stigmatized as they became the focus of mass hysteria and suffered isolation, marginalization and violence.\nThe Christian right champions itself as the \"self-appointed conscience of American society\". During the 1980s, the movement was largely dismissed by political pundits and mainstream religious leaders as \"a collection of buffoonish has-beens\". Later, it re-emerged, better organized and more focused, taking firm positions against abortion, pornography, sexual deviancy, and extreme feminism. Beginning around the first presidency of Donald Trump, Christian conservatives have largely refrained from engaging in debates about sexual morality.\nInfluential Christian right organizations at the forefront of the anti-gay rights movement in the United States include Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, and the Family Research Institute. An important stratagem in Christian right anti-gay politics is in its rejection of \"the edicts of a Big Brother\" state, allowing it to profit from \"a general feeling of discontent and demoralization with government\". As a result, the Christian right has endorsed smaller government, restricting its ability to arbitrate in disputes regarding values and traditions. In this context, gay rights laws have come to symbolize the government's allegedly unconstitutional \"[interference] with individual freedom\".\nThe central tenets of Focus on the Family and similar organizations, such as the Family Research Council, emphasise issues such as abortion and the necessity of gender roles. A number of organizations, including the New Christian Right, \"have in various ways rejected liberal America in favor of the regulation of pornography, anti-abortion legislation, the criminalization of homosexuality, and the virtues of faithfulness and loyalty in sexual partnerships\", according to sociologist Bryan S. Turner.\nSome members of the Christian right view same-sex marriage as a central issue in the culture wars, more so than other gay rights issues and even more significantly than abortion. The legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts in 2004 changed the Christian right, causing it to put its opposition to these marriages above most other issues. It also created previously unknown interracial and ecumenical coalitions, and stimulated new electoral activity in pastors and congregations.\nCriticism.\nCriticisms of the Christian right often come from Christians who believe Jesus' message was centered on social responsibility and social justice. Theologian Michael Lerner has summarized: \"The unholy alliance of the Political Right and the Religious Right threatens to destroy the America we love. It also threatens to generate a revulsion against God and religion by identifying them with militarism, ecological irresponsibility, fundamentalist antagonism to science and rational thought, and insensitivity to the needs of the poor and the powerless.\"\nCommentators such as Rob Schenck, Randall Balmer, and Charles M. Blow criticized the Christian right for its tolerance and embrace of Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential election despite Trump's failure to adhere to any of the principles advocated by the Christian right groups for decades. In a 2023 interview with NPR, Russell D. Moore stated that he had come to believe that Christianity was \"in a crisis\" after hearing multiple pastors speak of congregation members rejecting quotes from the Sermon on the Mount as \"liberal talking points\" and not backing down upon being informed of their source.\nInterpretation of Christianity.\nOne argument which questions the legitimacy of the Christian right posits that Jesus Christ may be considered a leftist on the modern political spectrum. Jesus' and Catholics\u2019 concern with the poor and feeding the hungry, among other things, are argued, by proponents of Christian leftism, to be core attributes of modern-day socialism and social justice. However, others contend that while Jesus' concern for the poor and hungry is virtuous and that individuals have a moral obligation to help others, the relationship between charity and the state should not be construed in the same manner.\nAccording to Frank Newport of Gallup, \"there are fewer Americans today who are both highly religious and liberal than there are Americans who are both highly religious and conservative.\" Newport also noted that 52% of white conservatives identify as \"highly religious\" while only 16% of white liberals identify as the same. However, African Americans, \"the most religious of any major racial or ethnic group in the country\", are \"strongly oriented to voting Democratic\". While observing that African-American Democrats are more religious than their white Democrat counterparts, Newport further noted, however, that African-American Democrats are \"much more likely to be ideologically moderate or conservative.\"\nSome criticize what they see as a politicization of Christianity because they say Jesus transcends political concepts.\nMikhail Gorbachev referred to Jesus as \"the first Socialist\".\nRace and diversity.\nThe Christian right has tried to recruit social conservatives in the black church. Prior to the 2016 United States presidential election, African-American Republican Ben Carson emerged as a leader of the Christian right. Other Christian African Americans who identify with conservatism are Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas, rapper Kanye West, Alveda King, and pastor Tony Evans.\nLGBT rights.\nWhilst the Christian right in the United States generally identifies with aspects of LGBT rights opposition, other Christian movements argue that the biblical texts only oppose specific types of divergent sexual behaviour, such as paederasty (i.e. sexual intercourse between boys and men). During the Trump administration, there was a growing push for religious liberty bills, aimed to exempt individuals and businesses from anti-discrimination laws intended to protect LGBT people, if they claimed that their actions were motivated by religious beliefs. Among the most powerful organizations that promoted anti-LGBT and anti-transgender legislation under the Trump administration is the Alliance Defending Freedom.\nUse of dominionism labeling.\nSome social scientists have used the word \"dominionism\" to refer to adherence of dominion theology, as well as to the influence in the broader Christian Right of ideas inspired by Dominion Theology. Although such influence (particularly of Reconstructionism) has been described by many authors, full adherents to Reconstructionism are few and marginalized among conservative Christians.\nIn the early 1990s, sociologist Sara Diamond defined \"dominionism\" in her PhD dissertation as a movement that, while it includes Dominion Theology and Reconstructionism as subsets, is much broader in scope, extending to much of the Christian Right. She was followed by journalists who included Frederick Clarkson and Chris Hedges and others who have stressed the influence of Dominionist ideas on the Christian right.\nThe terms \"dominionist\" and \"dominionism\" are rarely used for self-description, and their usage has been attacked from right-leaning quarters. Stanley Kurtz labeled it \"conspiratorial nonsense\", \"political paranoia\", and \"guilt by association\", and decried Hedges' \"vague characterizations\" that allow him to \"paint a highly questionable picture of a virtually faceless and nameless 'Dominionist' Christian mass.\" Kurtz also complained about a perceived link between average Christian evangelicals and extremism such as Christian Reconstructionism:\nThe notion that conservative Christians want to reinstitute slavery and rule by genocide is not just crazy, it's downright dangerous. The most disturbing part of the \"Harper's\" cover story (the one by Chris Hedges) was the attempt to link Christian conservatives with Hitler and fascism. Once we acknowledge the similarity between conservative Christians and fascists, Hedges appears to suggest, we can confront Christian evil by setting aside \"the old polite rules of democracy.\" So wild conspiracy theories and visions of genocide are really excuses for the Left to disregard the rules of democracy and defeat conservative Christians\u00a0\u2013 by any means necessary.\nLisa Miller of \"Newsweek\" said that many warnings about \"dominionism\" are \"paranoid\" and she also said that \"the word creates a siege mentality in which 'we' need to guard against 'them.'\" Ross Douthat of \"The New York Times\" noted that \"many of the people that writers like Diamond and others describe as 'dominionists' would disavow the label, many definitions of dominionism conflate several very different Christian political theologies, and there's a lively debate about whether the term is even useful at all.\" According to Joe Carter of \"First Things\", \"the term was coined in the 1980s by Diamond and is never used outside liberal blogs and websites. No reputable scholars use the term for it is a meaningless neologism that Diamond concocted for her dissertation\", while Jeremy Pierce of \"First Things\" coined the word \"dominionismist\" to describe those who promote the idea that there is a dominionist conspiracy.\nAnother criticism has focused on the proper use of the term. Berlet wrote that \"some critics of the Christian Right have stretched the term dominionism past its breaking point\", and argued that, rather than labeling conservatives as extremists, it would be better to \"talk to these people\" and \"engage them\". Sara Diamond wrote that \"[l]iberals' writing about the Christian Right's take-over plans has generally taken the form of conspiracy theory\", and argued that instead one should \"analyze the subtle ways\" that ideas like Dominionism \"take hold within movements and why.\"\nDan Olinger, a professor at the fundamentalist Bob Jones University in Greenville, South Carolina, said, \"We want to be good citizens and participants, but we're not really interested in using the iron fist of the law to compel people to do everything Christians should do.\" Bob Marcaurelle, interim pastor at Mountain Springs Baptist Church in Piedmont, said the Middle Ages were proof enough that Christian ruling groups are almost always corrupted by power. \"When Christianity becomes the government, the question is whose Christianity?\" Marcaurelle asked.\nMovements outside the United States.\nWhile the Christian right is a strong movement in the United States, it also has a presence in Canada. Alan Curtis suggests that the American Christian right \"is a phenomenon that is very hard for Europeans to understand.\" Robin Pettitt, a professor at Kingston University London, states, however, that like the Christian right in the US, Christian Democratic movements in Europe and Latin America are \"equally driven by the debate over the role of the state and the church in political, social and moral life.\"\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the Christian right draws from both Catholics and Protestants. Historically, the first Christian right party was the Democratic Labor Party. The Democratic Labor Party was formed in 1955 as a split from the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In Victoria, and New South Wales, state executive members, parliamentarians and branch members associated with the Industrial Groups or B. A. Santamaria and \"The Movement\" (and therefore strongly identified with Roman Catholicism) were expelled from the party, and formed the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Later in 1957, a similar split occurred in Queensland, with the resulting group subsequently joining the DLP. The party also had sitting members from Tasmania and New South Wales at various times, though it was much stronger in the former mentioned states. The goals of the party were anti communism, the decentralization of industry, population, administration and ownership. The party decided, in its view that the ALP was filled with communists, that it would preference the ruling conservative Liberal and Country parties over the ALP. However, it was more morally conservative, militantly anti-communist and socially compassionate than the Liberals.\nThe DLP heavily lost ground in the federal election of 1974 that saw its primary vote cut by nearly two-thirds, and the election of an ALP government. The DLP never regained its previous support in subsequent elections and formally disbanded in 1978, but a small group within the party refused to accept this decision and created a small, reformed successor party (now the Democratic Labour Party). Though his party was effectively gone, Santamaria and his National Civic Council (NCC) took a strong diametrically opposed stance to dominant Third Way/neoliberal/New Right tendencies within both the ALP and Liberal parties throughout the 1980s and early 1990s.\nThe B. A Santamaria and the Democratic Labor party produced many alumni who became the base of the Christian right in Australia. In Liberal party, these were Tony Abbott and Kevin Andrews. Outside the Liberal party, conservative commentator's such as Greg Sheridan and Gerrard Henderson also had links to Santamaria. Within the Australian Labor Party (ALP), this alumni can be found in the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association (SDA), which de-affiliated from the ALP with the industrial Groups in the 1950s, and then re-affiliated in the 1980s. The SDA opposed gay marriage and abortion, which were some reasons for workers to form another competing union. Tony Burke, who opposed euthanasia, came from the SDA. Currently, the NCC functions as a minority organization within the Christian Right.\nThe more Protestant strands of the Christian Right have been far more diverse. Fundamentalist Christianity directly inspired Fred Nile and his parties. Nile in 1967\u201368 was assistant director of the Billy Graham Crusade in Sydney. The Christian Democratic Party (initially known as the \"Call to Australia\" party) is on the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum, promoting social conservatism, opposing gay rights and abortion. It gained 9.1% of the vote in the New South Wales (NSW) state election of 1981, Its support base has generally been restricted to NSW and Western Australia, where it usually gains between 2\u20134% of votes, with its support being minuscule in other states. The party started to fall apart in 2019 when the moderate faction member, Paul Green, lost his seat, and when a faction of younger people attempted to dismiss the governing board. Whilst this failed, it opened up a rift between the traditional party factions that led to prolonged legal disputes and the party winding up in 2022. Fred Nile would quickly join a new party.\nThe Family First Party is a former political party which was linked with Pentecostal Church and other smaller Christian denominations, and was also identified with the strongly religious conservative end of the Australian political spectrum. It has had one or two members in the SA parliament since 2002, and in 2004 also managed to elect a Victorian senator. Its electoral support is small, with the largest constituencies being South Australia (4\u20136%), and Victoria (around 4%). Family First generally receives lower support in national elections than in state elections. Family First was merged with the Australian Conservatives Party in 2017.\nOutside of the Catholic links to B.A. Santamaria and the minor Protestant parties, some party members of the Liberal and National Party Coalition and the Australian Labor Party also support some of the values of the Christian right on abortion and gay rights. The Australian Christian Lobby argues for opposition to same-sex marriage in state and federal politics.\nBrazil.\nIn Brazil, the evangelical caucus have a great influence at the parliament and in the society in general. The bloc promotes strong socially conservative positions, like opposition to abortion, LGBT rights, marijuana legalization, sexual and gender education at schools and support to decrease of age of defense of infancy. Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like Workers' Party or Socialism and Liberty Party, Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like Social Democratic Party, Democratas, PSL, Social Christian Party, Brazilian Republican Party, Patriota and in the Party of the Republic. In 2016, Marcelo Crivella, a licensed pentecostal pastor from the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, won in a runoff the election to mayor of Rio de Janeiro, the second biggest city in Brazil, with the Brazilian Republican Party, making for the first time an evangelical bloc member mayor of a big city in Brazil. In 2018, Jair Bolsonaro was elected president with massive support of conservative Catholics, Charismatics, Evangelicals and Pentecostals; Another candidate, Cabo Daciolo, from Patriota, attracted much attention from media and public in general, despite a lower votation. Both had a right-wing populist, Christian nationalist program, but Bolsonaro was near to a national conservative and economic liberal one, contrasting with an Ultranationalist, theocratic and protectionist style of Daciolo.\nCanada.\nReligion has been a key factor in Canadian politics since well before the Canadian Confederation was established in 1867, when the Conservatives were the party of traditionalist Catholics and Anglicans and the Liberals were the party of Protestant dissenters and anti-clerical Catholics. This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the Christian left (represented by the Social Gospel philosophy and ecumenicism) and the Christian right (represented by fundamentalism and biblical literalism). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the New Democratic Party while the right moved to the Social Credit Party, especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the Progressive Conservatives.\nThe Social Credit Party, founded in 1935, represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as \"worldly\", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher William Aberhart or \"Bible Bill\". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the monetary reform theories of social credit to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple Ernest Manning then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada\nIn 1987, Manning's son, Preston Manning, founded the new Reform Party of Canada, which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the official opposition from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the Canadian Alliance in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the Conservative Party of Canada, led by Stephen Harper, a member of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, who went on to become prime minister in 2006.\nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, introduced by the patriation of the Canadian Constitution in 1982, has been controversial within the Christian right in Canada. Although this Charter entrenches rights and freedoms (such as the freedom of religion) that are central in the belief systems of the Christian right, it has also been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada to strike down many laws supported by the Christian right. In 1982, the Supreme Court struck down Canada's \"Lords' Day Act,\" which required many stored to be closed on Sundays, as an infringement the freedom of conscience and religion. Abortion, partly decriminalized in 1969 by an act of Parliament, was completely decriminalized after the two \"R. v. Morgentaler\" cases (in 1988 and in 1993). Parliament attempted to pass a new law governing abortion in 1993, but this legislation failed after a tie vote in the Senate. A series of provincial superior court decisions which legalized same-sex marriage led the federal government to introduce legislation that legalized same-sex marriage in all of Canada. Before he took office, former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper stated that he would hold a free vote on the issue, and declared the issue closed after it was voted down in the House of Commons in 2006.\nIn 2013, the Supreme Court struck down Canada's prostitution law in \"Canada v Bedford\", prompting the Stephen Harper government to introduce a new prostitution law fashioned after the Nordic Model. In 2015, the Supreme Court struck down Canada's prohibition on euthanasia in \"Carter v Canada\", again leading Parliament to pass a new law governing euthanasia. The Christian right has been critical of all these judicial decisions and have generally been the greatest advocates for the stringent laws against abortion, same-sex marriage, prostitution, and euthanasia, though in differing degrees. For instance, the Christian right in Canada is strongly and vocally organized on the topic of abortion, but criticism of same-sex marriage is far more seldom. In 2021 the Canadian government passed Bill C-4, banning conversion therapy nationwide, which received opposition from the Christian Right and Conservative members of parliament. Christian Pastors altered their preaching schedules to criticize and discuss this new law.\nThe Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nChristian right politics in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa is strongly connected with the growing propagation of the Evangelical-Pentecostal movement in the Global South and Third World countries. Roman Catholics in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Sub-Saharan Africa, despite being normally socially conservative, tend to be more left-wing in economics due to the traditional teachings of the Catholic social doctrine. Evangelical-Pentecostal Christians, on the other hand, are mostly from the neo-Pentecostal movement, and thus believers in the Prosperity theology that justifies most of their neoliberal economic ideas. They are also strongly socially conservative, even for Latin American standards.\nMexico.\nIn Mexico, the interests of the Christian right are represented by different political organisations and civil associations. The most notable case is the National Action Party, a conservative party aligned with Christian Democratic ideas, notably influenced by the Social teaching of the Catholic Church, and which has held the presidency of Mexico twice. The party's platform states strong opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and the legalisation of drugs, among many other conservative policies. In addition, prominent figures in the party have been linked to Catholic Church organisations. The evangelical caucus, albeit for a relatively short time, was represented by the Social Encounter Party and the Solidarity Encounter Party, the latter being the successor to the former. Both parties were founded by Hugo Eric Flores, who according to some sources was an evangelical minister before entering politics. Initially statewide for Baja California, Social Encounter came to govern that state in coalition with the National Action Party. The party would later be officialised as a political party at the federal level. Other organisations and associations adhering to the ideals of the Christian right include the Frente Nacional por la Familia, the Organizaci\u00f3n del Bien Com\u00fan, colloquially known as El Yunque and with close ties to the PAN, and the Legionaries of Christ, a Roman Catholic clerical religious order of priests and candidates for the priesthood established in Mexico.\nNetherlands.\nIn the Netherlands, Calvinist Protestants have long had their own political parties, now called the Reformed Political Party (SGP) on the right, and the ChristianUnion (CU) in the center. For generations they operated their own newspapers and broadcasting association. The SGP has about 28,000 members, and three out of 150 members of the Dutch parliament's lower house. It has always been in opposition to the government.\nNorthern Ireland.\nIn Northern Ireland, Ian Paisley led a Protestant fundamentalist party, the Democratic Unionist Party, which had a considerable influence on the province's culture. For a time after the 2017 United Kingdom general election, the DUP provided confidence and supply to the governing Conservative Party, although this agreement provoked concern from socially liberal elements of the party about possible DUP influence on social policy. Although there is no evidence this occurred. Karen Armstrong has mentioned British evangelical leader Colin Urquhart as advocating positions similar to the Christian Right.\nOther countries.\nIn Fiji, Sodelpa is a conservative, nationalist party which seeks to make Christianity the state religion, while the constitution makes Fiji a secular republic. Following the 2014 general election, Sodelpa is the main opposition party in Parliament.\nIn Hungary, the ruling national-conservative party Fidesz can also be considered to be a party of the Christian right. Viktor Orb\u00e1n is known for his use of conservative Christian values against immigration and the rise of Islam in Europe.\nIn the Philippines, due to Spanish colonization, and the introduction of the Catholic Church, religious conservatism has a strong influence on national policies. Some have argued that the U.S. Christian right may have roots in the Philippines.\nIn Poland, the Roman Catholic national-conservative party Law and Justice can be considered to be a party of the Christian right.\nIn Russia, the United Russia has collaborated closely with the Russian Orthodox Church, boosting the Kremlin's appeal to social conservatives.\nIn Scandinavia, the Faroe Island's Centre Party is a bible-oriented fundamentalist party with about 4% of the vote.

{"id": "63321", "revid": "20685249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63321", "title": "Peter O'Toole", "text": "British actor (1932\u20132013)\nPeter James O'Toole (; 2 August 1932 \u2013 14 December 2013) was an English actor known for his leading roles on stage and screen. His numerous accolades include the Academy Honorary Award, a BAFTA Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and four Golden Globe Awards as well as nominations for a Grammy Award and a Laurence Olivier Award.\nO'Toole started his training at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London and began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company. In 1959, he made his West End debut in \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\", and played the title role in \"Hamlet\" in the National Theatre's first production in 1963. Excelling on stage, O'Toole was known for his \"hellraiser\" lifestyle off-stage. He received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Comedy Performance for his portrayal of Jeffrey Bernard in the play \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\" (1990).\nMaking his film debut in 1959, O'Toole received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for portraying T. E. Lawrence in the historical epic \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962). He was further Oscar-nominated for playing King Henry II in both \"Becket\" (1964) and \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968), a public school teacher in \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (1969), a paranoid schizophrenic in \"The Ruling Class\" (1972), a ruthless film director in \"The Stunt Man\" (1980), a film actor in \"My Favorite Year\" (1982), and an elderly man in \"Venus\" (2006). He holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting without a win (tied with Glenn Close). In 2002, he was awarded the Academy Honorary Award for his career achievements.\nO'Toole also starred in films such as \"What's New Pussycat?\" (1965), \"How to Steal a Million\" (1966), \"Man of La Mancha\" (1972), \"Caligula\" (1979), \"Zulu Dawn\" (1979), and \"Supergirl\" (1984), with supporting roles in \"The Last Emperor\" (1987), \"Bright Young Things\" (2003), \"Troy\" (2004), \"Stardust\" (2007), and \"Dean Spanley\" (2008). He voiced Anton Ego, the restaurant critic in Pixar's animated film \"Ratatouille\" (2007). On television, he received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his portrayal of Bishop Pierre Cauchon in the CBS miniseries \"Joan of Arc\" (1999). He was Emmy-nominated for his performances as Lucius Flavius Silva in the ABC miniseries \"Masada\" (1981), and Paul von Hindenburg in the miniseries \"\" (2003).\nEarly life and education.\nPeter O'Toole was born on 2 August 1932, the son of Constance Jane Eliot (n\u00e9e Ferguson), a Scottish nurse, and Patrick Joseph \"Spats\" O'Toole, an Irish metal plater, football player, and bookmaker. O'Toole claimed he was not certain of his birthplace or date, stating in his autobiography that he accepted 2 August as his birth date but had birth certificates from England and Ireland. The birth certificate recorded at the Leeds General Register Office says he was born at St James's University Hospital in Leeds, Yorkshire, England, on 2 August 1932, and named Peter James O'Toole. He later affected the Irish equivalent \"Seamus\" as his middle name.\nO'Toole had an elder sister named Patricia and grew up in the south Leeds suburb of Hunslet. When he was one year old, his family began a five-year tour of major racecourse towns in Northern England. He and his sister were brought up in their father's Catholic faith. O'Toole was evacuated from Leeds early in the Second World War, and went to a Catholic school for seven or eight years: St Joseph's Secondary School in Hunslet, Leeds. He later said, \"I used to be scared stiff of the nuns: their whole denial of womanhood\u2014the black dresses and the shaving of the hair\u2014was so horrible, so terrifying. [...] Of course, that's all been stopped. They're sipping gin and tonic in the Dublin pubs now, and a couple of them flashed their pretty ankles at me just the other day.\"\nUpon leaving school, O'Toole obtained employment as a trainee journalist and photographer on the \"Yorkshire Evening Post\", until he was called up for national service as a signaller in the Royal Navy. As reported in a radio interview in 2006 on NPR, he was asked by an officer whether he had something he had always wanted to do. His reply was that he had always wanted to try being either a poet or an actor.\nHe attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London from 1952 to 1954 on a scholarship. This came after being rejected by the Abbey Theatre's drama school in Dublin by the director Ernest Blythe, because he could not speak the Irish language. At RADA, he was in the same class as Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Brian Bedford. O'Toole described this as \"the most remarkable class the academy ever had, though we weren't reckoned for much at the time. We were all considered dotty.\"\nActing career.\n1954\u20131961: Early work and rise to prominence.\nO'Toole began working in the theatre, gaining recognition as a Shakespearean actor at the Bristol Old Vic and with the English Stage Company, before making his television debut in 1954. He played a soldier in an episode of \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" in 1954. He was based at the Bristol Old Vic from 1956 to 1958, appearing in productions of \"King Lear\", \"The Recruiting Officer\", \"Major Barbara\", \"Othello\", and \"The Slave of Truth\" (all 1956). He was Henry Higgins in \"Pygmalion\", Lysander in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", Uncle Gustave in \"Oh! My Papa!\", and Jimmy Porter in \"Look Back in Anger\" (all 1957). O'Toole was Tanner in Shaw's \"Man and Superman\" (1958), a performance he reprised often during his career. He was also in \"Hamlet\", \"The Holiday\", \"Amphitryon '38\", and \"Waiting for Godot\" (as Vladimir; all 1958). He hoped \"The Holiday\" would take him to the West End but it ultimately folded in the provinces; during that show he met Si\u00e2n Phillips who became his first wife.\nO'Toole continued to appear on television, being in episodes of \"Armchair Theatre\" (\"The Pier\", 1957), and \"BBC Sunday-Night Theatre\" (\"The Laughing Woman\", 1958) and was in the TV adaptation of \"The Castiglioni Brothers\" (1958). He made his London debut in a musical, \"Oh, My Papa\". He gained fame on the West End in the play \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\", performed at the Royal Court beginning in January 1959. His co-stars included Robert Shaw and Edward Judd, and it was directed by Lindsay Anderson. O'Toole reprised his performance for television on \"Theatre Night\" in 1959 (although he did not appear in the 1961 film version). The show transferred to the West End in April and won O'Toole Best Actor of the Year in 1959.\nO'Toole was in much demand. He reportedly received five offers of long-term contracts but turned them down. His first role was a small role in Disney's version of \"Kidnapped\" (1960), playing the bagpipes opposite Peter Finch. His second feature was \"The Savage Innocents\" (1960) with Anthony Quinn for director Nicholas Ray, although his voice was dubbed by that of another actor. With his then wife Sian Phillips he did \"Siwan: The King's Daughter\" (1960) for TV. In 1960 he had a nine-month season at the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford, appearing in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (as Petruchio), \"The Merchant of Venice\" (as Shylock) and \"Troilus and Cressida\" (as Thersites). He could have made more money in films but said \"You've got to go to Stratford when you've got the chance.\"\nO'Toole had been seen in \"The Long and the Short and the Tall\" by Jules Buck who later established a company with the actor. Buck cast O'Toole in \"The Day They Robbed the Bank of England\" (1960), a heist thriller from director John Guillermin. O'Toole was billed third, beneath Aldo Ray and Elizabeth Sellars. The following year he appeared in several episodes of the TV series \"Rendezvous\" (\"End of a Good Man\", \"Once a Horseplayer\", \"London-New York\"). He lost the role in the film adaptation of \"Long and the Short and the Tall\" to Laurence Harvey. \"It broke my heart\", he said later.\n1962\u20131972: \"Lawrence of Arabia\" and stardom.\nO'Toole's major break came in November 1960 when he was chosen to play the eponymous hero T. E. Lawrence in Sir David Lean's epic \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), after Albert Finney reportedly turned down the part. The role introduced him to a global audience and earned him the first of his eight nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor. He received the BAFTA Award for Best British Actor. His performance was ranked number one in \"Premiere\" magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time. In 2003, Lawrence as portrayed by O'Toole was selected as the tenth-greatest hero in cinema history by the American Film Institute. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1989 \"The then unknown Peter O'Toole, with his charmingly diffident manner and his hair and eyes looking unnaturally gold and blue, accounted for no small part of this film's appeal to impressionable young fans\".\nO'Toole played Hamlet under Laurence Olivier's direction in the premiere production of the Royal National Theatre in 1963. The casting of O'Toole as the Dane was met with some controversy with Michael Gambon describing him as a \"god with bright blonde hair\". On playing the role O'Toole stated he was \"sick with nerves\", adding \"If you want to know what it's like to be lonely, really lonely, try playing Hamlet.\" \"The Times\" wrote, \"Mr O'Toole, like Olivier, is an electrifyingly outgoing actor, and it is a surprise to see him make his first appearance...with his features twisted into melancholy\" He performed in \"Baal\" (1963) at the Phoenix Theatre.\nEven prior to the making of \"Lawrence of Arabia\", O'Toole announced he wanted to form a production company with Jules Buck. In November 1961 they said their company, known as Keep Films (also known as Tricolor Productions) would make a film starring Terry-Thomas, \"Operation Snatch\". In 1962 O'Toole and Buck announced they wanted to make a version of \"Waiting for Godot\" for \u00a380,000. The film was never made. Instead their first production was \"Becket\" (1964), where O'Toole played King Henry II opposite Richard Burton. The film, done in association with Hal Wallis, was a financial success.\nO'Toole turned down the lead role in \"The Cardinal\" (1963). Instead he and Buck made another epic, \"Lord Jim\" (1965), based on the novel by Joseph Conrad directed by Richard Brooks. He and Buck intended to follow this with a biopic of Will Adams and a film about the Charge of the Light Brigade, but neither project happened. Instead O'Toole went into \"What's New Pussycat?\" (1965), a comedy based on a script by Woody Allen, taking over a role originally meant for Warren Beatty and starring alongside Peter Sellers. It was a huge success. He and Buck helped produce \"The Party's Over\" (1965). O'Toole returned to the stage with \"Ride a Cock Horse\" at the Piccadilly Theatre in 1965, which was harshly reviewed. He made a heist film with Audrey Hepburn, \"How to Steal a Million\" (1966), directed by William Wyler. He played the Three Angels in the all-star \"\" (1966), directed by John Huston. In 1966 at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin he appeared in productions of \"Juno and the Paycock\" and \"Man and Superman\".\nSam Spiegel, producer of \"Lawrence of Arabia\", reunited O'Toole with Omar Sharif in \"The Night of the Generals\" (1967), which was a box office disappointment. O'Toole played in an adaptation of No\u00ebl Coward's \"Present Laughter\" for TV in 1968, and had a cameo in \"Casino Royale\" (1967). He played Henry II again in \"The Lion in Winter\" (1968) alongside Katharine Hepburn, and was nominated for an Oscar again\u00a0\u2013 one of the few times an actor had been nominated playing the same character in different films. The film was also successful at the box office. Less popular was \"Great Catherine\" (1968) with Jeanne Moreau, an adaptation of the play by George Bernard Shaw which Buck and O'Toole co-produced. In 1969, he played the title role in the film \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\", a musical adaptation of James Hilton's novella, starring opposite Petula Clark. He was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actor and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy. O'Toole fulfilled a lifetime ambition in 1970 when he performed on stage in Samuel Beckett's \"Waiting for Godot\", alongside Donal McCann, at Dublin's Abbey Theatre.\nIn other films, he played a man in love with his sister (played by Susannah York) in \"Country Dance\" (1970). O'Toole starred in a war film for director Peter Yates, \"Murphy's War\" (1971), appearing alongside Sian Phillips. He was reunited with Richard Burton in a film version of \"Under Milk Wood\" (1972) by Dylan Thomas, produced by himself and Buck; Elizabeth Taylor co-starred. The film was not a popular success. He received another Academy Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance in \"The Ruling Class\" (1972), done for his own company. In 1972, he played both Miguel de Cervantes and his fictional creation Don Quixote in \"Man of La Mancha\", the motion picture adaptation of the 1965 hit Broadway musical, opposite Sophia Loren. The film was a critical and commercial failure, criticised for using mostly non-singing actors. His singing was dubbed by tenor Simon Gilbert, but the other actors did their own singing. O'Toole and co-star James Coco, who played both Cervantes's manservant and Sancho Panza, both received Golden Globe nominations for their performances.\n1973\u20131999: Established actor.\nO'Toole did not make a film for several years. He performed at the Bristol Old Vic from 1973 to 1974 in \"Uncle Vanya\", \"Plunder\", \"The Apple Cart\" and \"Judgement\". He returned to films with \"Rosebud\" (1975), a flop thriller for Otto Preminger, in which O'Toole replaced Robert Mitchum at the last minute. He followed it with \"Man Friday\" (1975), an adaptation of the Robinson Crusoe story, which was the last work from Keep Films. O'Toole made \"Foxtrot\" (1976), directed by Arturo Ripstein. He was critically acclaimed for his performance in \"Rogue Male\" (1976) for British television. He did \"Dead Eyed Dicks\" on stage in Sydney in 1976. Less well received was \"Power Play\" (1978), made in Canada, and \"Zulu Dawn\" (1979), shot in South Africa. He toured \"Uncle Vanya\" and \"Present Laughter\" on stage. In 1979, O'Toole starred as Tiberius in the controversial \"Penthouse\"-funded biopic \"Caligula\" acting alongside Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren and John Gielgud.\nIn 1980, he received critical acclaim for playing the director in the behind-the-scenes film \"The Stunt Man\". His performance earned him an Oscar nomination. He appeared in a mini-series for Irish TV, \"Strumpet City\", in which he played James Larkin. He followed this with another mini-series, \"Masada\" (1981), playing Lucius Flavius Silva. In 1980, he performed in \"Macbeth\" at the Old Vic for $500 a week (), a performance that famously earned O'Toole some of the worst reviews of his career.\nO'Toole was nominated for another Oscar for \"My Favorite Year\" (1982), a light romantic comedy about the behind-the-scenes at a 1950s TV variety-comedy show, in which O'Toole plays an ageing swashbuckling film star reminiscent of Errol Flynn. He returned to the stage in London with a performance in \"Man and Superman\" (1982) that was better received than his \"Macbeth\". He focused on television, doing an adaptation of \"Man and Superman\" (1983), \"Svengali\" (1983), \"Pygmalion\" (1984), and \"Kim\" (1984), and providing the voice of Sherlock Holmes for a series of animated TV movies. He played in \"Pygmalion\" on stage in 1984 at the West End's Shaftesbury Theatre.\nO'Toole returned to feature films in \"Supergirl\" (1984), \"Creator\" (1985), \"Club Paradise\" (1986), \"The Last Emperor\" (1987) as Sir Reginald Johnston, and \"High Spirits\" (1988). He appeared on Broadway in an adaptation of \"Pygmalion\" (1987), opposite Amanda Plummer. It ran for 113 performances.\nHe won a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\" (1989). His other appearances that decade include \"Uncle Silas\" (1989) for television. O'Toole's performances in the 1990s include \"Wings of Fame\" (1990); \"The Rainbow Thief\" (1990), with Sharif; \"King Ralph\" (1991) with John Goodman; \"Isabelle Eberhardt\" (1992); \"Rebecca's Daughters\" (1992), in Wales; \"Civvies\" (1992), a British TV series; \"The Seventh Coin\" (1993); ' (1994), for American TV; and \"Heavy Weather\" (1995), for British TV. He was in an adaptation of \"Gulliver's Travels\" (1996), playing the Emperor of Lilliput; ' (1997), playing Sir Arthur Conan Doyle; \"Phantoms\" (1998), from a novel by Dean Koontz; and \"\" (1999). He won a Primetime Emmy Award for his role as Bishop Pierre Cauchon in the 1999 mini-series \"Joan of Arc\". He also produced and starred in a TV adaptation of \"Jeffrey Bernard Is Unwell\" (1999).\n2000\u20132013: Resurgence and final roles.\nO'Toole's work in the next decade included \"Global Heresy\" (2002); \"The Final Curtain\" (2003); \"Bright Young Things\" (2003); ' (2003) for TV, as Paul von Hindenburg; and ' (2004) as Augustus Caesar. In 2004, he played King Priam in \"Troy\". In 2005, he appeared on television as the older version of legendary 18th century Italian adventurer Giacomo Casanova in the BBC drama serial \"Casanova\". The younger Casanova, on screen for most of the action, was played by David Tennant, who had to wear contact lenses to match his brown eyes to O'Toole's blue. He followed it with a role in \"Lassie\" (2005).\nO'Toole was once again nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for his portrayal of Maurice in the 2006 film \"Venus\", directed by Roger Michell, his eighth such nomination. He was in \"One Night with the King\" (2007) and co-starred in the Pixar animated film \"Ratatouille\" (2007), an animated film about a rat with dreams of becoming the greatest chef in Paris, as Anton Ego, a food critic. He had a small role in \"Stardust\" (2007). O'Toole also appeared in the second season of Showtime's drama series \"The Tudors\" (2008), portraying Pope Paul III, who excommunicates King Henry VIII from the church, an act which leads to a confrontation between the two men in seven of the ten episodes. Also in 2008, he starred with Jeremy Northam and Sam Neill in the New Zealand/British film \"Dean Spanley\", based on an Alan Sharp adaptation of Irish author Lord Dunsany's short novel, \"My Talks with Dean Spanley\".\nO'Toole appeared in \"Thomas Kinkade's Christmas Cottage\" (2008) and \"Iron Road\" (2009), a Canadian-Chinese miniseries. O'Toole's final performances were in \"Eldorado\" (2012) and \"For Greater Glory: The True Story of Cristiada\" (2012). On 10 July 2012, O'Toole released a statement announcing his retirement from acting. A number of films were released after his retirement and death: \"Decline of an Empire\" (2013), as Gallus, and \"Diamond Cartel\" (2017).\nPersonal life.\nPersonal views.\nWhile studying at RADA in the early 1950s, O'Toole opposed the Korean War, and later became a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. During the 1960s, he was involved in the opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War. He played a role in the creation of the current form of the well-known Irish folk song \"Carrickfergus\" which he related to Dominic Behan, who put it in print and made a recording in the mid-1960s.\nAlthough he lost faith in organised religion as a teenager, O'Toole expressed positive sentiments regarding the life of Jesus Christ. In an interview for \"The New York Times\", he said \"No one can take Jesus away from me... there's no doubt there was a historical figure of tremendous importance, with enormous notions. Such as peace.\" He called himself \"a retired Christian\" who prefers \"an education and reading and facts\" to faith.\nBritish Pakistani playwright Hanif Kureishi states in his memoir that O'Toole told him \"The only Paki I ever liked was Omar Sharif.\"\nIreland.\nThe son of an Irishman, O\u2019Toole had a strong affinity with Ireland and on occasion referred to himself as Irish: \u201cI consider myself to be an Irishman but I have lived most of my life in England so I am fairly bogus Irish actor as such\u201d. In an interview with Charlie Rose in 1992 he said Irishness was \u201calmost the centre of my very being\u201d and that \u201cEverything I think of is coloured by its history, by its literature, by its people, by its geography\u201d. He recalls that he was \u201ca bit of a misfit, a bit of an odd man out\u201d but that when he went to County Kerry, Ireland in 1946 he realized \u201cI wasn\u2019t different at all\u201d.\nHe possessed an Irish passport and believed he may have been born in Connemara. He owned a house in Ireland located in Clifden, County Galway. In 1969, he met future Irish president Michael D. Higgins and the two developed a friendship.\nHis son Lorcan was born in Dublin in 1983. He told his friends that he wanted him to be \"raised as an Irishman\".\nRelationships.\nIn 1959, O'Toole married Welsh actress Si\u00e2n Phillips, with whom he had two daughters: actress Kate and Patricia. They were divorced in 1979. Phillips later said in two autobiographies that O'Toole had subjected her to mental cruelty, largely fuelled by drinking, and was subject to bouts of extreme jealousy when she finally left him for a younger lover.\nO'Toole and his girlfriend, model Karen Brown, had a son, Lorcan O'Toole (born 17 March 1983), when O'Toole was 50 years old. Lorcan, now an actor, was a pupil at Harrow School, boarding at West Acre from 1996.\nSports.\nO'Toole played rugby league as a child in Leeds and was also a rugby union fan, attending Five Nations matches with friends and fellow rugby fans Richard Harris, Kenneth Griffith, Peter Finch and Richard Burton. He was also a lifelong player, coach and enthusiast of cricket and a fan of Sunderland A.F.C. His support of Sunderland was passed on to him through his father, who was a labourer in Sunderland for many years. He was named their most famous fan. The actor in a later interview expressed that he no longer considered himself as much of a fan following the demolition of Roker Park and the subsequent move to the Stadium of Light. He described Roker Park as his last connection to the club and that everything \"they meant to him was when they were at Roker Park\".\nHealth.\nSevere illness almost ended O'Toole's life in the late 1970s. His stomach cancer was misdiagnosed as resulting from his alcoholic excess. O'Toole underwent surgery in 1976 to have his pancreas and a large portion of his stomach removed, which resulted in insulin-dependent diabetes. In 1978, he nearly died from a hematologic disease. He eventually recovered and returned to work. He resided on the Sky Road, just outside Clifden, Connemara, County Galway, from 1963, and at the height of his career maintained homes in Dublin, London, and Paris (at the Ritz, which was where his character supposedly lived in the film \"How to Steal a Million\").\nInterests and influences.\nIn an interview with NPR in December 2006, O'Toole revealed that he knew all 154 of Shakespeare's sonnets. A self-described romantic, O'Toole said of the sonnets that nothing in the English language compares with them, and that he read them daily. In \"Venus\" (2006), he recites Sonnet 18 (\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\").\nO'Toole wrote two memoirs. \"Loitering with Intent: The Child\" chronicles his childhood in the years leading up to the Second World War, and was a \"New York Times\" Notable Book of the Year in 1992. His second, \"Loitering With Intent: The Apprentice\", is about his years spent training with a cadre of friends at RADA.\nO'Toole was interviewed at least three times by Charlie Rose on his eponymous talk show. In a 17 January 2007 interview, O'Toole stated that British actor Eric Porter had most influenced him, adding that the difference between actors of yesterday and today is that actors of his generation were trained for \"theatre, theatre, theatre\". He also believes that the challenge for the actor is \"to use his imagination to link to his emotion\" and that \"good parts make good actors.\" However, in other venues (including the DVD commentary for \"Becket\"), O'Toole credited Donald Wolfit as being his most important mentor.\nDeath and legacy.\nO'Toole retired from acting in July 2012 owing to a recurrence of stomach cancer. He died on 14 December 2013 at the Wellington Hospital in St John's Wood, London, at the age of 81. His funeral was held at Golders Green Crematorium in London on 21 December 2013, where his body was cremated in a wicker coffin. His family stated their intention to fulfil his wishes and take his ashes to the west of Ireland.\nOn 18 May 2014, a new prize was launched in memory of O'Toole at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School; this includes an annual award given to two young actors from the school, and a professional contract. He has a memorial plaque in St Paul's, the Actors' Church in Covent Garden, London.\nOn 21 April 2017, the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin announced that Kate O'Toole had placed her father's archive at the Humanities Research Centre. The collection includes O'Toole's scripts, extensive published and unpublished writings, props, photographs, letters, medical records, and more. It joins the archives of several of O'Toole's collaborators and friends, including Donald Wolfit, Eli Wallach, Peter Glenville, Sir Tom Stoppard, and Dame Edith Evans.\nActing credits and accolades.\nO'Toole was the recipient of numerous nominations and awards. He was offered a knighthood but rejected it in objection to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's policies. He received four Golden Globe Awards, one BAFTA Award for Best British Actor (for \"Lawrence of Arabia\") and one Primetime Emmy Award.\nAcademy Award nominations\nO'Toole was nominated eight times for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role but was never able to win a competitive Oscar. In 2002, the Academy honoured him with an Academy Honorary Award for his entire body of work and his lifelong contribution to film. O'Toole initially balked about accepting and wrote the Academy a letter saying that he was \"still in the game\" and would like more time to \"win the lovely bugger outright\". The Academy informed him that they would bestow the award whether he wanted it or not. He told Charlie Rose in January 2007 that his children admonished him, saying that it was the highest honour one could receive in the filmmaking industry. O'Toole agreed to appear at the ceremony and receive his Honorary Oscar. It was presented to him by Meryl Streep. He joked with Robert Osborne during an interview at Turner Classic Movies' film festival that he was the \"Biggest Loser of All Time\" due to failure to win an Academy Award after multiple nominations.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also known as Bacchus ( or ; ) by the Greeks (a name later adopted by the Romans) for a frenzy he is said to induce called \"baccheia\". His wine, music, and ecstatic dance were considered to free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful. His \"thyrsus\", a fennel-stem sceptre, sometimes wound with ivy and dripping with honey, is both a beneficent wand and a weapon used to destroy those who oppose his cult and the freedoms he represents. Those who partake of his mysteries are believed to become possessed and empowered by the god himself.\nHis origins are uncertain, and his cults took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as Thracian, others as Greek. In Orphism, he was variously a son of Zeus and Persephone; a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus; or the twice-born son of Zeus and the mortal Semele. The Eleusinian Mysteries identify him with Iacchus, the son or husband of Demeter. Most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner. His attribute of \"foreignness\" as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of epiphany, sometimes called \"the god who comes\".\nWine was a religious focus in the cult of Dionysus and was his earthly incarnation. Wine could ease suffering, bring joy, and inspire divine madness. Festivals of Dionysus included the performance of sacred dramas enacting his myths, the initial driving force behind the development of theatre in Western culture. The cult of Dionysus is also a \"cult of the souls\"; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead. He is sometimes categorised as a dying-and-rising god. Scholars note parallels between Dionysus and Jesus as dying-and-rising gods, though key differences and contexts complicate direct comparisons.\nRomans identified Bacchus with their own Liber Pater, \"the free Father\" of the Liberalia festival, patron of viniculture, wine and male fertility, and guardian of the traditions, rituals and freedoms attached to coming of age and citizenship, but the Roman state treated independent, popular festivals of Bacchus (Bacchanalia) as subversive, partly because their free mixing of classes and genders transgressed traditional social and moral constraints. Celebration of the Bacchanalia was made a capital offence, except in the toned-down forms and greatly diminished congregations approved and supervised by the State. Festivals of Bacchus were merged with those of Liber and Dionysus.\nName.\nEtymology.\nThe \"dio-\" prefix in Ancient Greek (; ) has been associated since antiquity with \"Zeus\" (genitive \"Dios\"), and the variants of the name seem to point to an original \"*Dios-nysos\". The earliest attestation is the Mycenaean Greek dative form \"(di-wo-nu-so)\", featured on two tablets that had been found at Mycenaean Pylos and dated to the twelfth or thirteenth century BC. At that time, there could be no certainty on whether this was indeed a theonym, but the 1989\u201390 Greek-Swedish Excavations at Kastelli Hill, Chania, unearthed, \"inter alia\", four artefacts bearing Linear B inscriptions; among them, the inscription on item KH Gq 5 is thought to confirm Dionysus's early worship.\nIn Mycenaean Greek the form of Zeus is \"di-wo\". The second element is of unknown origin. It is perhaps associated with Mount Nysa, the birthplace of the god in Greek mythology, where he was nursed by nymphs (the Nysiads), although Pherecydes of Syros had postulated as an archaic word for \"tree\" by the sixth century BC. On a vase of Sophilos the Nysiads are named (). Kretschmer asserted that () is a Thracian word that has the same meaning as (), a word similar with () (daughter in law, or bride, I-E *snus\u00f3s, Sanskr. \"snus\u0101\"). He suggested that the male form is () and this would make Dionysus the \"son of Zeus\". Jane Ellen Harrison believed that the name Dionysus means \"young Zeus\". Robert S. P. Beekes has suggested a Pre-Greek origin of the name, since all attempts to find an Indo-European etymology are doubtful.\nMeaning and variants.\nLater variants include and in Boeotia; in Thessaly; and in Ionia; and in Aeolia, besides other variants. A prefix is found in other names, such as that of the Dioscures, and may derive from \"Dios\", the genitive of the name of Zeus.\nNonnus, in his \"Dionysiaca\", writes that the name Dionysus means \"Zeus-limp\" and that Hermes named the new born Dionysus this, \"because Zeus while he carried his burden lifted one foot with a limp from the weight of his thigh, and \"nysos\" in Syracusan language means limping\". In his note to these lines, W. H. D. Rouse writes \"It need hardly be said that these etymologies are wrong\". The \"Suda\", a Byzantine encyclopedia based on classical sources, states that Dionysus was so named \"from accomplishing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd] for each of those who live the wild life. Or from providing [\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd] everything for those who live the wild life.\"\nOrigins.\nAcademics in the nineteenth century, using study of philology and comparative mythology, often regarded Dionysus as a foreign deity who was only reluctantly accepted into the standard Greek pantheon at a relatively late date, based on his myths which often involve this theme\u2014a god who spends much of his time on earth abroad, and struggles for acceptance when he returns to Greece. However, more recent evidence has shown that Dionysus was in fact one of the earliest gods attested in mainland Greek culture. The earliest written records of Dionysus worship come from Mycenaean Greece, specifically in and around the Palace of Nestor in Pylos, dated to around 1300 BC. The details of any religion surrounding Dionysus in this period are scant, and most evidence comes in the form only of his name, written as \"di-wo-nu-su-jo\" (\"Dionysoio\" = 'of Dionysus') in Linear B, preserved on fragments of clay tablets that indicate a connection to offerings or payments of wine, which was described as being \"of Dionysus\". References have also been uncovered to \"women of Oinoa\", the \"place of wine\", who may correspond to the Dionysian women of later periods.\nOther Mycenaean records from Pylos record the worship of a god named Eleuther, who was the son of Zeus, and to whom oxen were sacrificed. The link to both Zeus and oxen, as well as etymological links between the name Eleuther or Eleutheros with the Latin name Liber Pater, indicates that this may have been another name for Dionysus. According to K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi, these clues suggest that even in the thirteenth century BC, the core religion of Dionysus was in place, as were his important myths. At Knossos in Minoan Crete, men were often given the name \"Pentheus\", who is a figure in later Dionysian myth and which also means \"suffering\". Ker\u00e9nyi argued that to give such a name to one's child implies a strong religious connection, potentially not the separate character of Pentheus who suffers at the hands of Dionysus's followers in later myths, but as an epithet of Dionysus himself, whose mythology describes a god who must endure suffering before triumphing over it. According to Ker\u00e9nyi, the title of \"man who suffers\" likely originally referred to the god himself, only being applied to distinct characters as the myth developed.\nThe oldest known image of Dionysus accompanied by his name is found on a dinos by the Attic potter Sophilos around 570 BC and is located in the British Museum. By the seventh century, iconography found on pottery shows that Dionysus was already worshiped as more than just a god associated with wine. He was associated with weddings, death, sacrifice, and sexuality, and his retinue of satyrs and dancers was already established. A common theme in these early depictions was the metamorphosis, at the hand of the god, of his followers into hybrid creatures, usually represented by both tame and wild satyrs, representing the transition from civilised life back to nature as a means of escape.\nA Mycenaean variant of Bacchus was thought to have been \"a divine child\" abandoned by his mother and eventually raised by \"nymphs, goddesses, or even animals.\"\nEpithets.\nDionysus was variably known with the following epithets:\nAcratophorus, \"\u1f08\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"giver of unmixed wine\"), at Phigaleia in Arcadia.\nAcroreites at Sicyon.\nAdoneus, a rare archaism in Roman literature, a Latinised form of Adonis, used as epithet for Bacchus.\nAegobolus \"\u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"goat-shooter\") at Potniae, in Boeotia.\nAesymnetes \"\u0391\u1f30\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03bd\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\" (\"ruler\" or \"lord\") at Aro\u00eb and Patrae in Achaea.\nAgrios \"\u1f0c\u03b3\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"wild\"), in Macedonia.\nAndrogynos \"\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"androgynous\"), refers to the god assuming both the active, masculine and passive, feminine role during intercourse with male lovers.\nAnthroporraistes, \"\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \" (\"man-destroyer\"), a title of Dionysus at Tenedos.\nBassareus, \"\u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2\" a Thracian name for Dionysus, which derives from \"bassaris\" or \"fox-skin\", which item was worn by his cultists in their mysteries.\n Bougenes, \"\u0392\u03bf\u03c5\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2 or \u0392\u03bf\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03ae\u03c2\" (\"borne by a cow\"), in the Mysteries of Lerna.\n Braetes, \"\u0392\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2\" (\"related to beer\") at Thrace.\nBrisaeus, \"\u0392\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2\", a surname of Dionysus, derived either from mount Brisa in Lesbos or from a nymph Brisa, who was said to have brought up the god.\nBriseus, \"\u0392\u03c1\u1fd1\u03c3\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2\" (\"he who prevails\") in Smyrna.\nBromios \"\u0392\u03c1\u03cc\u03bc\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2\" (\"roaring\", as of the wind, primarily relating to the central death/resurrection element of the myth, but also the god's transformations into lion and bull, and the boisterousness of those who drink alcohol.

In the Roman pantheon, Sabazius became an alternative name for Bacchus.\nWorship and festivals in Greece.\nThe worship of Dionysus had become firmly established by the seventh century BC. He may have been worshiped as early as c. 1500\u20131100 BC by Mycenaean Greeks; and traces of Dionysian-type cult have also been found in ancient Minoan Crete.\nDionysia.\nThe Dionysia, Haloa, Ascolia and Lenaia festivals were dedicated to Dionysus. The Rural Dionysia (or Lesser Dionysia) was one of the oldest festivals dedicated to Dionysus, begun in Attica, and probably celebrated the cultivation of wines. It was held during the winter month of Poseideon (the time surrounding the winter solstice, modern December or January). The Rural Dionysia centered on a procession, during which participants carried phalluses, long loaves of bread, jars of water and wine as well as other offerings, and young girls carried baskets. The procession was followed by a series of dramatic performances and drama competitions.\nThe City Dionysia (or Greater Dionysia) took place in urban centers such as Athens and Eleusis, and was a later development, probably beginning during the sixth century BC. Held three months after the Rural Dionysia, the Greater festival fell near the spring equinox in the month of Elaphebolion (modern March or April). The procession of the City Dionysia was similar to that of the rural celebrations, but more elaborate, and led by participants carrying a wooden statue of Dionysus, and including sacrificial bulls and ornately dressed choruses. The dramatic competitions of the Greater Dionysia also featured more noteworthy poets and playwrights, and prizes for both dramatists and actors in multiple categories.\nAnthesteria.\nThe Anthesteria (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1) was an Athenian festival that celebrated the beginning of spring. It spanned three days: Pithoigia (\u03a0\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03af\u03b3\u03b9\u03b1, \"Jar-Opening\"), Choes (\u03a7\u03bf\u03b1\u03af, \"The Pouring\") and Chythroi (\u03a7\u03cd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \"The Pots\"). It was said the dead arose from the underworld during the span of the festival. Along with the souls of the dead, the Keres also wandered through the city and had to be banished when the festival ended. On the first day, Wine vats were opened. The wine was opened and mixed in honour of the god. The rooms and the drinking vessels were adorned with flowers along with children over three years of age.\nOn the second day, a solemn ritual for Dionysus occurred along with drinking. People dressed up, sometimes as members of Dionysus's entourage, and visited others. Choes was also the occasion of a solemn and secret ceremony in one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus in the Lenaeum, which was closed for the rest of the year. The basilissa (or basilinna), wife of the basileus, underwent a symbolic ceremonial marriage to the god, possibly representing a Hieros gamos. The basilissa was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons (called Gerarai) who were chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy.\nThe last day was dedicated to the dead. Offerings were also offered to Hermes, due to his connection to the underworld. It was considered a day of merrymaking. Some poured Libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. Chythroi ended with a ritual cry intended to order the souls of the dead to return to the underworld. Keres were also banished from the festival on the last day.\nTo protect themselves from evil, people chewed leaves of whitethorn and smeared their doors with tar to protect themselves. The festival also allowed servants and slaves to participate in the festivities.\nBacchic Mysteries.\nThe central religious cult of Dionysus is known as the Bacchic or Dionysian Mysteries. The exact origin of this religion is unknown, though Orpheus was said to have invented the mysteries of Dionysus. Evidence suggests that many sources and rituals typically considered to be part of the similar Orphic Mysteries actually belong to Dionysian mysteries. Some scholars have suggested that, additionally, there is no difference between the Dionysian mysteries and the mysteries of Persephone, but that these were all facets of the same mystery religion, and that Dionysus and Persephone both had important roles in it. Previously considered to have been a primarily rural and fringe part of Greek religion, the major urban center of Athens played an important role in the development and spread of the Bacchic mysteries.\nThe Bacchic mysteries served an important role in creating ritual traditions for transitions in people's lives; originally primarily for men and male sexuality, but later also created space for ritualising women's changing roles and celebrating changes of status in a woman's life. This was often symbolised by a meeting with the gods who rule over death and change, such as Hades and Persephone, but also with Dionysus's mother Semele, who probably served a role related to initiation into the mysteries.\nThe religion of Dionysus often included rituals involving the sacrifice of goats or bulls, and at least some participants and dancers wore wooden masks associated with the god. In some instances, records show the god participating in the ritual via a masked and clothed pillar, pole, or tree, while his worshipers eat bread and drink wine. The significance of masks and goats to the worship of Dionysus seems to date back to the earliest days of his worship, and these symbols have been found together at a Minoan tomb near Phaistos in Crete.\nEleusinian Mysteries.\nAs early as the fifth century BC, Dionysus became identified with Iacchus, a minor deity from the tradition of the Eleusinian Mysteries. This association may have arisen because of the homophony of the names Iacchus and Bacchus. Two black-figure lekythoi (c. 500 BC), possibly represent the earliest evidence for such an association. The nearly-identical vases, one in Berlin, the other in Rome, depict Dionysus, along with the inscription \"IAKXNE\", a possible miswriting of \"IAKXE\". More early evidence can be found in the works of the fifth-century BC Athenian tragedians Sophocles and Euripides. In Sophocles's \"Antigone\" (c. 441 BC), an ode to Dionysus begins by addressing Dionysus as the \"God of many names\" (\"\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03c5\u03ce\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b5\"), who rules over the glens of Demeter's Eleusis, and ends by identifying him with \"Iacchus the Giver\", who leads \"the chorus of the stars whose breath is fire\" and whose \"attendant Thyiads\" dance in \"night-long frenzy\". And in a fragment from a lost play, Sophocles describes Nysa, Dionysus's traditional place of nurture: \"From here I caught sight of Nysa, haunt of Bacchus, famed among mortals, which Iacchus of the bull's horns counts as his beloved nurse\". In Euripides's \"Bacchae\" (c. 405 BC), a messenger, describing the Bacchic revelries on mount Cithaeron, associates Iacchus with Bromius, another of the names of Dionysus, saying, they \"began to wave the thyrsos\u00a0... calling on Iacchus, the son of Zeus, Bromius, with united voice.\"\nAn inscription found on a stone stele (c. 340 BC), found at Delphi, contains a paean to Dionysus, which describes his travels. From Thebes, where he was born, he first went to Delphi where he displayed his \"starry body\", and with \"Delphian girls\" took his \"place on the folds of Parnassus\", then next to Eleusis, where he is called \"Iacchus\":\nAnd in your hand brandishing your night-\nlighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy\nyou went to the vales of Eleusis\nwhere the whole people of Hellas'\nland, alongside your own native witnesses\nof the holy mysteries, calls upon you\nas Iacchus: for mortals from their pains\nyou have opened a haven without toils.\nStrabo, says that Greeks \"give the name 'Iacchus' not only to Dionysus but also to the leader-in-chief of the mysteries\". In particular, Iacchus was identified with the Orphic Dionysus, who was a son of Persephone. Sophocles mentions \"Iacchus of the bull's horns\", and according to the first-century BC historian Diodorus Siculus, it was this older Dionysus who was represented in paintings and sculptures with horns, because he \"excelled in sagacity and was the first to attempt the yoking of oxen and by their aid to effect the sowing of the seed\". Arrian, the second-century Greek historian, wrote that it was to this Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone, \"not the Theban Dionysus, that the mystic chant 'Iacchus' is sung\". The second-century poet Lucian also referred to the \"dismemberment of Iacchus\".\nThe fourth- or fifth-century poet Nonnus associated the name Iacchus with the \"third\" Dionysus. He described the Athenian celebrations given to the first Dionysus Zagreus, son of Persephone, the second Dionysus Bromios, son of Semele, and the third Dionysus Iacchus:\nThey [the Athenians] honoured him as a god next after the son of Persephone, and after Semele's son; they established sacrifices for Dionysos late born and Dionysos first born, and third they chanted a new hymn for Iacchos. In these three celebrations Athens held high revel; in the dance lately made, the Athenians beat the step in honour of Zagreus and Bromios and Iacchos all together.\nBy some accounts, Iacchus was the husband of Demeter. Several other sources identify Iacchus as Demeter's son. The earliest such source, a fourth-century BC vase fragment at Oxford, shows Demeter holding the child Dionysus on her lap. By the first-century BC, Demeter suckling Iacchus had become such a common motif, that the Latin poet Lucretius could use it as an apparently recognisable example of a lover's euphemism. A scholiast on the second-century AD Aristides, explicitly names Demeter as Iacchus's mother.\nOrphism.\nIn the Orphic tradition, the \"first Dionysus\" was the son of Zeus and Persephone, and was dismembered by the Titans before being reborn. Dionysus was the patron god of the Orphics, who they connected to death and immortality, and he symbolised the one who guides the process of reincarnation.\nThis Orphic Dionysus is sometimes referred to with the alternate name Zagreus (). The earliest mentions of this name in literature describe him as a partner of Gaia and call him the highest god. Aeschylus linked Zagreus with Hades, as either Hades's son or Hades himself. Noting \"Hades' identity as Zeus' \"katachthonios\" alter ego\", Timothy Gantz thought it likely that Zagreus, originally, perhaps, the son of Hades and Persephone, later merged with the Orphic Dionysus, the son of Zeus and Persephone. However, no known Orphic sources use the name \"Zagreus\" to refer to the Orphic Dionysus. It is possible that the association between the two was known by the third century BC, when the poet Callimachus may have written about it in a now-lost source. Callimachus, as well as his contemporary Euphorion, told the story of the dismemberment of the infant Dionysus, and Byzantine sources quote Callimachus as referring to the birth of a \"Dionysos Zagreus\", explaining that Zagreus was the poets' name for the \"chthonic\" aspect of Dionysus. The earliest definitive reference to the belief that Zagreus is another name for the Orphic Dionysus is found in the late first century writings of Plutarch. The fifth century Greek poet Nonnus's \"Dionysiaca\" tells the story of this Orphic Dionysus, in which Nonnus calls him the \"older Dionysos \u00a0... illfated Zagreus\", \"Zagreus the horned baby\", \"Zagreus, the first Dionysos\", \"Zagreus the ancient Dionysos\", and \"Dionysos Zagreus\".\nWorship and festivals in Rome.\nBacchus was most often known by that name in Rome and other locales in the Republic and Empire, although many \"often called him Dionysus.\"\nLiber and importation to Rome.\nThe mystery cult of Bacchus was brought to Rome from the Greek culture of southern Italy or by way of Greek-influenced Etruria. It was established around 200 BC in the Aventine grove of Stimula by a priestess from Campania, near the temple where Liber Pater (\"the Free Father\") had a State-sanctioned, popular cult. Liber was a native Roman god of wine, fertility, and prophecy, patron of Rome's plebeians (citizen-commoners), and one of the members of the Aventine Triad, along with his mother Ceres and sister or consort Libera. A temple to the Triad was erected on the Aventine Hill in 493 BC, along with the institution of celebrating the festival of Liberalia. The worship of the Triad gradually took on more and more Greek influence, and by 205 BC, Liber and Libera had been formally identified with Bacchus and Proserpina. Liber was often interchangeably identified with Dionysus and his mythology, though this identification was not universally accepted. Cicero insisted on the \"non-identity of Liber and Dionysus\" and described Liber and Libera as children of Ceres.\nLiber, like his Aventine companions, carried various aspects of his older cults into official Roman religion. He protected various aspects of agriculture and fertility, including the vine and the \"soft seed\" of its grapes, wine and wine vessels, and male fertility and virility. Pliny called Liber \"the first to establish the practice of buying and selling; he also invented the diadem, the emblem of royalty, and the triumphal procession.\" Roman mosaics and sarcophagi attest to various representations of a Dionysus-like exotic triumphal procession. In Roman and Greek literary sources from the late Republic and Imperial era, several notable triumphs feature similar, distinctively \"Bacchic\" processional elements, recalling the supposedly historic \"Triumph of Liber\".\nLiber and Dionysus may have had a connection that predated Classical Greece and Rome, in the form of the Mycenaean god Eleutheros, who shared the lineage and iconography of Dionysus but whose name has the same meaning as Liber. Before the importation of the Greek cults, Liber was already strongly associated with Bacchic symbols and values, including wine and uninhibited freedom, as well as the subversion of the powerful. Several depictions from the late Republic era feature processions, depicting the \"Triumph of Liber\".\nBacchanalia.\nIn Rome, the most well-known festivals of Bacchus were the Bacchanalia, based on the earlier Greek Dionysia festivals. These Bacchic rituals were said to have included omophagic practices, such as pulling live animals apart and eating the whole of them raw. This practice served not only as a reenactment of the infant death and rebirth of Bacchus, but also as a means by which Bacchic practitioners produced \"enthusiasm\": etymologically, to let a god enter the practitioner's body or to have her become one with Bacchus.\nIn Livy's account (late 1st century BC), the Bacchic mysteries were a novelty at Rome; originally restricted to women and held only three times a year, they were corrupted by an Etruscan-Greek version, and thereafter drunken, disinhibited men and women of all ages and social classes cavorted in a sexual free-for-all five times a month. Livy relates their various outrages against Rome's civil and religious laws and traditional morality (\"mos maiorum\"); a secretive, subversive and potentially revolutionary counter-culture. Livy's sources, and his own account of the cult, probably drew heavily on the Roman dramatic \"genre\" known as \"Satyr plays\", based on Greek originals. The cult was suppressed by the State with great ferocity; of the 7,000 arrested, most were executed. Modern scholarship treats much of Livy's account with skepticism; more certainly, a Senatorial edict, the \"Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus\" (186 BC) was distributed throughout Roman and allied Italy. It banned the former Bacchic cult organisations. Each meeting must seek prior senatorial approval through a praetor. No more than three women and two men were allowed at any one meeting, and those who defied the edict risked the death penalty.\nBacchus was conscripted into the official Roman pantheon as an aspect of Liber, and his festival was inserted into the Liberalia. In Roman culture, Liber, Bacchus and Dionysus became virtually interchangeable equivalents. Thanks to his mythology involving travels and struggles on earth, Bacchus became euhemerised as a historical hero, conqueror, and founder of cities. He was a patron deity and founding hero at Leptis Magna, birthplace of the emperor Septimius Severus, who promoted his cult. In some Roman sources, the ritual procession of Bacchus in a tiger-drawn chariot, surrounded by maenads, satyrs and drunkards, commemorates the god's triumphant return from the conquest of India. Pliny believed this to be the historical prototype for the Roman Triumph.\nPost-classical worship.\nLate Antiquity.\nIn the Neoplatonist philosophy and religion of Late Antiquity, the Olympian gods were sometimes considered to number 12 based on their spheres of influence. For example, according to Sallustius, \"Jupiter, Neptune, and Vulcan fabricate the world; Ceres, Juno, and Diana animate it; Mercury, Venus, and Apollo harmonise it; and, lastly, Vesta, Minerva, and Mars preside over it with a guarding power.\" The multitude of other gods, in this belief system, subsist within the primary gods, and Sallustius taught that Bacchus subsisted in Jupiter.\nIn the Orphic tradition, a saying was supposedly given by an oracle of Apollo that stated \"Zeus, Hades, [and] Helios-Dionysus\" were \"three gods in one godhead\". This statement apparently conflated Dionysus not only with Hades, but also his father Zeus, and implied a particularly close identification with the sun-god Helios. When quoting this in his \"Hymn to King Helios\", Emperor Julian substituted Dionysus's name with that of Serapis, whose Egyptian counterpart Osiris was also identified with Dionysus.\nWorship from the Middle Ages to the Modern period.\nThree centuries after the reign of Theodosius I which saw the outlawing of pagan worship across the Roman Empire, the 692 Quinisext Council in Constantinople felt it necessary to warn Christians against participating in persisting rural worship of Dionysus, specifically mentioning and prohibiting the feast day Brumalia, \"the public dances of women\", ritual cross-dressing, the wearing of Dionysiac masks, and the invoking of Bacchus's name when \"squeez[ing] out the wine in the presses\" or \"when pouring out wine into jars\".\nAccording to the Lanercost chronicle, during Easter in 1282 in Scotland, the parish priest of Inverkeithing led young women in a dance in honor of Priapus and Father Liber, commonly identified with Dionysus. The priest danced and sang at the front, carrying a representation of the phallus on a pole. He was killed by a Christian mob later that year. Historian C. S. Watkins believes that Richard of Durham, the author of the chronicle, identified an occurrence of apotropaic magic (by making use of his knowledge of ancient Greek religion), rather than recording an actual case of the survival of a pagan ritual.\nIn the eighteenth century, Hellfire Clubs appeared in Britain and Ireland. Though activities varied between the clubs, some of them were very pagan, and included shrines and sacrifices. Dionysus was one of the most popular deities, alongside deities like Venus and Flora. Today one can still see the statue of Dionysus left behind in the Hellfire Caves.\nIn 1820, Ephraim Lyon founded the Church of Bacchus in Eastford, Connecticut. He declared himself High Priest, and added local drunks to the list of membership. He maintained that those who died as members would go to a Bacchanalia for their afterlife.\nModern pagan and polytheist groups often include worship of Dionysus in their traditions and practices, most prominently groups which have sought to revive Hellenic polytheism, such as the Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes (YSEE). In addition to libations of wine, modern worshipers of Dionysus offer the god grape vines, ivy, and various forms of incense, particularly styrax. They may also celebrate Roman festivals such as the Liberalia (17 March, close to the Spring Equinox) or Bacchanalia (Various dates), and various Greek festivals such as the Anthesteria, Lenaia, and the Greater and Lesser Dionysias, the dates of which are calculated by the lunar calendar.\nIdentification with other gods.\nOsiris.\nIn the Greek interpretation of the Egyptian pantheon, Dionysus was often identified with Osiris. Stories of the dismembering of Osiris and his re-assembly and resurrection by Isis closely parallel those of the Orphic Dionysus and Demeter. According to Diodorus Siculus, as early as the fifth century BC, the two gods had been syncretised as a single deity known as Dionysus-Osiris. The most notable record of this belief is found in Herodotus's 'Histories'. Plutarch was of the same opinion, recording his belief that Osiris and Dionysus were identical and stating that anyone familiar with the secret rituals associated with the two gods would recognise obvious parallels between them, noting that the myths of their dismembering and their associated public symbols constituted sufficient additional evidence to prove that they were, in fact the same god worshiped by the two cultures under different names.\nOther syncretic Greco-Egyptian deities arose out of this conflation, including with the gods Serapis and Hermanubis. Serapis was believed to be both Hades and Osiris, and the Roman Emperor Julian considered him the same as Dionysus as well. Dionysus-Osiris was particularly popular in Ptolemaic Egypt, as the Ptolemies claimed descent from Dionysus, and as Pharaohs they had claim to the lineage of Osiris. This association was most notable during a deification ceremony where Mark Antony became Dionysus-Osiris, alongside Cleopatra as Isis-Aphrodite.\nEgyptian myths about Priapus said that the Titans conspired against Osiris, killed him, divided his body into equal parts, and \"slipped them secretly out of the house\". All but Osiris's penis, which since none of them \"was willing to take it with him\", they threw into the river. Isis, Osiris's wife, hunted down and killed the Titans, reassembled Osiris's body parts \"into the shape of a human figure\", and gave them \"to the priests with orders that they pay Osiris the honours of a god\". But since she was unable to recover the penis she ordered the priests \"to pay to it the honours of a god and to set it up in their temples in an erect position.\"\nHades.\nThe fifth\u2013fourth century BC philosopher Heraclitus, unifying opposites, declared that Hades and Dionysus, the very essence of indestructible life \"(zo\u00eb)\", are the same god. Among other evidence, Karl Ker\u00e9nyi notes in his book that the Homeric Hymn \"To Demeter\", votive marble images and epithets all link Hades to being Dionysus. He also notes that the grieving goddess Demeter refused to drink wine, as she states that it would be against \"themis\" (the very nature of order and justice) for her to drink wine, which is the gift of Dionysus, after Persephone's abduction because of this association; indicating that Hades may in fact have been a \"cover name\" for the underworld Dionysus. He suggests that this dual identity may have been familiar to those who came into contact with the Mysteries. One of the epithets of Dionysus was \"Chthonios\", meaning \"the subterranean\".\nEvidence for a cult connection is quite extensive, particularly in southern Italy, especially when considering the heavy involvement of death symbolism included in Dionysian worship. Statues of Dionysus found in the Ploutonion at Eleusis give further evidence as the statues found bear a striking resemblance to the statue of Eubouleus, also called \"Aides Kyanochaites\" (Hades of the flowing dark hair), known as the youthful depiction of the Lord of the Underworld. The statue of Eubouleus is described as being radiant but disclosing a strange inner darkness. Ancient portrayals show Dionysus holding in his hand the kantharos, a wine-jar with large handles, and occupying the place where one would expect to see Hades. Archaic artist Xenocles portrayed on one side of a vase, Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, each with his emblems of power; with Hades's head turned back to front and, on the other side, Dionysus striding forward to meet his bride Persephone, with the kantharos in his hand, against a background of grapes. Dionysus also shared several epithets with Hades such as \"Chthonios\", \"Eubouleus and Euclius\".\nBoth Hades and Dionysus were associated with a divine tripartite deity with Zeus. Zeus, like Dionysus, was occasionally believed to have an underworld form, closely identified with Hades, to the point that they were occasionally thought of as the same god.\nAccording to Marguerite Rigoglioso, Hades is Dionysus, and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone. This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus, not Hades, impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus. Rigoglioso argues that taken together, these myths suggest a belief that is that, with Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created (in terms quoted from Ker\u00e9nyi) \"a second, a little Dionysus\", who is also a \"subterranean Zeus\". The unification of Hades, Zeus, and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the 'shining' realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades. According to Rosemarie Taylor-Perry,it is often mentioned that Zeus, Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god\u00a0... Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus, doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus, Hades abducts his 'daughter' and paramour Persephone. The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force: Iacchos (Zagreus-Dionysus), also known as Liknites, the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld (chthonic) realm of Hades and the Olympian (\"Shining\") one of Zeus.\nSabazios and Yahweh.\nThe Phrygian god Sabazios was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus. The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, \"Suda\" (c. tenth century), stated: Sabazios\u00a0... is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry \"sabazein\". Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry \"sabasmos\"; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call \"saboi\" those places that had been dedicated to him and his Bacchantes\u00a0... Demosthenes [in the speech] \"On Behalf of Ktesiphon\" [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.\nStrabo, in the first century, linked Sabazios with Zagreus among Phrygian ministers and attendants of the sacred rites of Rhea and Dionysos. Strabo's Sicilian contemporary, Diodorus Siculus, conflated Sabazios with the secret Dionysus, born of Zeus and Persephone, However, this connection is not supported by any surviving inscriptions, which are entirely to \"Zeus Sabazios\".\nSeveral ancient sources record an apparently widespread belief in the classical world that the god worshiped by the Jewish people, Yahweh, was identifiable as Dionysus or Liber via his identification with Sabazios. Tacitus, Lydus, Cornelius Labeo, and Plutarch all either made this association, or discussed it as an extant belief (though some, like Tacitus, specifically brought it up in order to reject it). According to Plutarch, one of the reasons for the identification is that Jews were reported to hail their god with the words \"Euoe\" and \"Sabi\", a cry typically associated with the worship of Sabazius. According to scholar Sean M. McDonough, it is possible that Plutarch's sources had confused the cry of \"Iao Sabaoth\" (typically used by Greek speakers in reference to Yahweh) with the Sabazian cry of \"Euoe Saboe\", originating the confusion and conflation of the two deities. The cry of \"Sabi\" could also have been conflated with the Jewish term \"sabbath\", adding to the evidence the ancients saw that Yahweh and Dionysus/Sabazius were the same deity. Further bolstering this connection would have been coins used by the Maccabees that included imagery linked to the worship of Dionysus such as grapes, vine leaves, and cups. However the belief that the Jewish god was identical with Dionysus/Sabazius was widespread enough that a coin dated to 55 BC depicting a kneeling king was labelled \"Bacchus Judaeus\" (\"BACCHIVS IVDAEVS\"), and in 139 BC praetor Cornelius Scipio Hispalus deported Jewish people for attempting to \"infect the Roman customs with the cult of Jupiter Sabazius\".\nMythology.\nVarious different accounts and traditions existed in the ancient world regarding the parentage, birth, and life of Dionysus on earth, complicated by his several rebirths. By the first century BC, some mythographers had attempted to harmonise the various accounts of Dionysus's birth into a single narrative involving not only multiple births, but two or three distinct manifestations of the god on earth throughout history in different lifetimes. The historian Diodorus Siculus said that according to \"some writers of myths\" there were two gods named Dionysus, an older one, who was the son of Zeus and Persephone, but that the \"younger one also inherited the deeds of the older, and so the men of later times, being unaware of the truth and being deceived because of the identity of their names thought there had been but one Dionysus.\" He also said that Dionysus \"was thought to have two forms\u00a0... the ancient one having a long beard, because all men in early times wore long beards, and the younger one being long-haired, youthful and effeminate and young.\"\nThough the varying genealogy of Dionysus was mentioned in many works of classical literature, only a few contain the actual narrative myths surrounding the events of his multiple births. These include the first century BC \"Bibliotheca historica\" by Greek historian Diodorus, which describes the birth and deeds of the three incarnations of Dionysus; the brief birth narrative given by the first century AD Roman author Hyginus, which describes a double birth for Dionysus; and a longer account in the form of Greek poet Nonnus's epic \"Dionysiaca\", which discusses three incarnations of Dionysus similar to Diodorus's account, but which focuses on the life of the third Dionysus, born to Zeus and Semele.\nFirst birth.\nThough Diodorus mentions some traditions which state an older, Indian or Egyptian Dionysus existed who invented wine, no narratives are given of his birth or life among mortals, and most traditions ascribe the invention of wine and travels through India to the last Dionysus. According to Diodorus, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus and Persephone (or alternately, Zeus and Demeter). This is the same horned Dionysus described by Hyginus and Nonnus in later accounts, and the Dionysus worshiped by the Orphics, who was dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. Nonnus calls this Dionysus Zagreus, while Diodorus says he is also considered identical with Sabazius. However, unlike Hyginus and Nonnus, Diodorus does not provide a birth narrative for this incarnation of the god. It was this Dionysus who was said to have taught mortals how to use oxen to plow the fields, rather than doing so by hand. His worshipers were said to have honored him for this by depicting him with horns.\nThe Greek poet Nonnus gives a birth narrative for Dionysus in his late fourth or early fifth century AD epic \"Dionysiaca\". In it, he described how Zeus \"intended to make a new Dionysos grow up, a bullshaped copy of the older Dionysos\" who was the Egyptian god Osiris. (Dionysiaca 4) Zeus took the shape of a serpent (\"drakon\"), and \"ravished the maidenhood of unwedded Persephoneia.\" According to Nonnus, though Persephone was \"the consort of the blackrobed king of the underworld\", she remained a virgin, and had been hidden in a cave by her mother to avoid the many gods who were her suitors, because \"all that dwelt in Olympos were bewitched by this one girl, rivals in love for the marriageable maid.\" (Dionysiaca 5) After her union with Zeus, Persephone's womb \"swelled with living fruit\", and she gave birth to a horned baby, named Zagreus. Zagreus, despite his infancy, was able to climb onto the throne of Zeus and brandish his lightning bolts, marking him as Zeus's heir. Hera saw this and alerted the Titans, who smeared their faces with chalk and ambushed the infant Zagreus \"while he contemplated his changeling countenance reflected in a mirror.\" They attacked him. However, according to Nonnus, \"where his limbs had been cut piecemeal by the Titan steel, the end of his life was the beginning of a new life as Dionysos.\" He began to change into many different forms in which he returned the attack, including Zeus, Cronus, a baby, and \"a mad youth with the flower of the first down marking his rounded chin with black.\" He then transformed into several animals to attack the assembled Titans, including a lion, a wild horse, a horned serpent, a tiger, and, finally, a bull. Hera intervened, killing the bull with a shout, and the Titans finally slaughtered him and cut him into pieces. Zeus attacked the Titans and had them imprisoned in Tartaros. This caused the mother of the Titans, Gaia, to suffer, and her symptoms were seen across the whole world, resulting in fires and floods, and boiling seas. Zeus took pity on her, and in order to cool down the burning land, he caused great rains to flood the world. (Dionysiaca 6)\nInterpretation.\nIn the Orphic tradition, Dionysus was, in part, a god associated with the underworld. As a result, the Orphics considered him the son of Persephone, and believed that he had been dismembered by the Titans and then reborn. The earliest attestation of this myth of the dismemberment and rebirth of Dionysus comes from the 1st century BC, in the works of Philodemus and Diodorus Siculus. Later, Neoplatonists such as Damascius and Olympiodorus added a number of further elements to the myth, including the punishment of the Titans by Zeus for their act, their destruction by a thunderbolt from his hand, and the subsequent birth of humankind from their ashes; however, whether any of these elements were part of the original myth is the subject of debate among scholars. The dismemberment of Dionysus (the \"sparagmos\") has often been considered the most important myth of Orphism.\nMany modern sources identify this \"Orphic Dionysus\" with the god Zagreus, though this name does not seem to have been used by any of the ancient Orphics, who simply called him Dionysus. As pieced together from various ancient sources, the reconstructed story, usually given by modern scholars, goes as follows. Zeus had intercourse with Persephone in the form of a serpent, producing Dionysus. The infant was taken to Mount Ida, where, like the infant Zeus, he was guarded by the dancing Curetes. Zeus intended Dionysus to be his successor as ruler of the cosmos, but a jealous Hera incited the Titans to kill the child. Damascius claims that he was mocked by the Titans, who gave him a fennel stalk (\"thyrsus\") in place of his rightful scepter.\nDiodorus relates that Dionysus is the son of Zeus and Demeter, the goddess of agriculture, and that his birth narrative is an allegory for the generative power of the gods at work in nature. When the \"Sons of Gaia\" (i.e. the Titans) boiled Dionysus following his birth, Demeter gathered together his remains, allowing his rebirth. Diodorus noted the symbolism this myth held for its adherents: Dionysus, god of the vine, was born from the gods of the rain and the earth. He was torn apart and boiled by the sons of Gaia, or \"earth born\", symbolising the harvesting and wine-making process. Just as the remains of the bare vines are returned to the earth to restore its fruitfulness, the remains of the young Dionysus were returned to Demeter allowing him to be born again.\nSecond birth.\nThe birth narrative given by Gaius Julius Hyginus (c.\u200964 BC \u2013 17 AD) in \"Fabulae\" 167, agrees with the Orphic tradition that Liber (Dionysus) was originally the son of Jove (Zeus) and Proserpine (Persephone). Hyginus writes that Liber was torn apart by the Titans, so Jove took the fragments of his heart and put them into a drink which he gave to Semele, the daughter of Harmonia and Cadmus, king and founder of Thebes. This resulted in Semele becoming pregnant. Juno appeared to Semele in the form of her nurse, Beroe, and told her: \"Daughter, ask Jove to come to you as he comes to Juno, so you may know what pleasure it is to sleep with a god.\" When Semele requested that Jove do so, she was killed by a thunderbolt. Jove then took the infant Liber from her womb, and put him in the care of Nysus. Hyginus states that \"for this reason he is called Dionysus, and also the one with two mothers\" (\"dim\u0113t\u014dr\").\nNonnus describes how, when life was rejuvenated after the flood, it was lacking in revelry in the absence of Dionysus. \"The Seasons, those daughters of the lichtgang, still joyless, plaited garlands for the gods only of meadow-grass. For Wine was lacking. Without Bacchos to inspire the dance, its grace was only half complete and quite without profit; it charmed only the eyes of the company, when the circling dancer moved in twists and turns with a tumult of footsteps, having only nods for words, hand for mouth, fingers for voice.\" Zeus declared that he would send his son Dionysus to teach mortals how to grow grapes and make wine, to alleviate their toil, war, and suffering. After he became protector of humanity, Zeus promises, Dionysus would struggle on earth, but be received \"by the bright upper air to shine beside Zeus and to share the courses of the stars.\" (Dionysiaca 7).\nThe mortal princess Semele then had a dream, in which Zeus destroyed a fruit tree with a bolt of lightning, but did not harm the fruit. He sent a bird to bring him one of the fruits, and sewed it into his thigh, so that he would be both mother and father to the new Dionysus. She saw the bull-shaped figure of a man emerge from his thigh, and then came to the realisation that she herself had been the tree. Her father Cadmus, fearful of the prophetic dream, instructed Semele to make sacrifices to Zeus. Semele became a priestess of the god and, on one occasion, she was observed by Zeus as she slaughtered a bull at his altar and afterwards swam in the river Asopus to cleanse herself of the blood. Flying over the scene in the guise of an eagle, Zeus fell in love with Semele and repeatedly visited her secretly. The first time he came to Semele in her bed, he was adorned with various symbols of Dionysus. He transformed into a snake, and \"Zeus made long wooing, and shouted \"Euoi!\" as if the winepress were near, as he begat his son who would love the cry.\" Immediately, Semele's bed and chambers were overgrown with vines and flowers, and the earth laughed. Zeus then spoke to Semele, revealing his true identity, and telling her to be happy: \"you bring forth a son who shall not die, and you I will call immortal. Happy woman! you have conceived a son who will make mortals forget their troubles, you shall bring forth joy for gods and men.\" (Dionysiaca 7).\nDuring her pregnancy, Semele rejoiced in the knowledge that her son would be divine. She dressed herself in garlands of flowers and wreathes of ivy, and would run barefoot to the meadows and forests to frolic whenever she heard music. Hera became envious and feared that Zeus would replace her with Semele as queen of Olympus. She went to Semele in the guise of an old woman who had been Cadmus's wet nurse. She made Semele jealous of the attention Zeus gave to Hera, compared with their own brief liaison and provoked her to request Zeus to appear before her in his full godhood. Semele prayed to Zeus that he show himself. Zeus answered her prayers but warned her that no other mortals had ever seen him as he held his lightning bolts. Semele reached out to touch them and was burnt to ash. (Dionysiaca 8). But the infant Dionysus survived, and Zeus rescued him from the flames, sewing him into his thigh. \"So the rounded thigh in labour became female, and the boy too soon born was brought forth, but not in a mother's way, having passed from a mother's womb to a father's.\" (Dionysiaca 9). At his birth, he had a pair of horns shaped like a crescent moon. The Seasons crowned him with ivy and flowers, and wrapped horned snakes around his own horns.\nAn alternate birth narrative is given by Diodorus from the Egyptian tradition. In it, Dionysus is the son of Ammon, who Diodorus regards both as the creator god and a quasi-historical king of Libya. Ammon had married the goddess Rhea, but he had an affair with Amaltheia, who bore Dionysus. Ammon feared Rhea's wrath if she were to discover the child, so he took the infant Dionysus to Nysa (Dionysus's traditional childhood home). Ammon brought Dionysus into a cave where he was to be cared for by Nysa, a daughter of the hero Aristaeus. Dionysus grew famous due to his skill in the arts, his beauty, and his strength. It was said that he discovered the art of winemaking during his boyhood. His fame brought him to the attention of Rhea, who was furious with Ammon for his deception. She attempted to bring Dionysus under her own power but, unable to do so, she left Ammon and married Cronus.\nInterpretation.\nEven in antiquity, the account of Dionysus's birth to a mortal woman led some to argue that he had been a historical figure who became deified over time, a suggestion of Euhemerism (an explanation of mythic events having roots in mortal history) often applied to demi-gods. The 4th-century Roman emperor and philosopher Julian encountered examples of this belief, and wrote arguments against it. In his letter \"To the Cynic Heracleios\", Julian wrote \"I have heard many people say that Dionysus was a mortal man because he was born of Semele and that he became a god through his knowledge of theurgy and the Mysteries, and like our lord Heracles for his royal virtue was translated to Olympus by his father Zeus.\" However, to Julian, the myth of Dionysus's birth (and that of Heracles) stood as an allegory for a deeper spiritual truth. The birth of Dionysus, Julian argues, was \"no birth but a divine manifestation\" to Semele, who foresaw that a physical manifestation of the god Dionysus would soon appear. However, Semele was impatient for the god to come, and began revealing his mysteries too early; for her transgression, she was struck down by Zeus. When Zeus decided it was time to impose a new order on humanity, for it to \"pass from the nomadic to a more civilized mode of life\", he sent his son Dionysus from India as a god made visible, spreading his worship and giving the vine as a symbol of his manifestation among mortals. In Julian's interpretation, the Greeks \"called Semele the mother of Dionysus because of the prediction that she had made, but also because the god honored her as having been the first prophetess of his advent while it was yet to be.\" The allegorical myth of the birth of Dionysus, per Julian, was developed to express both the history of these events and encapsulate the truth of his birth outside the generative processes of the mortal world, but entering into it, though his true birth was directly from Zeus along into the intelligible realm.\nInfancy.\nAccording to Nonnus, Zeus gave the infant Dionysus to the care of Hermes. Hermes gave Dionysus to the Lamides, or daughters of Lamos, who were river nymphs. But Hera drove the Lamides mad and caused them to attack Dionysus, who was rescued by Hermes. Hermes next brought the infant to Ino for fostering by her attendant Mystis, who taught him the rites of the mysteries (Dionysiaca 9). In Apollodorus's account, Hermes instructed Ino to raise Dionysus as a girl, to hide him from Hera's wrath. However, Hera found him, and vowed to destroy the house with a flood; however, Hermes again rescued Dionysus, this time bringing him to the mountains of Lydia. Hermes adopted the form of Phanes, most ancient of the gods, and so Hera bowed before him and let him pass. Hermes gave the infant to the goddess Rhea, who cared for him through his adolescence.\nAnother version is that Dionysus was taken to the rain-nymphs of Nysa, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care Zeus rewarded them by placing them as the Hyades among the stars (see Hyades star cluster). In yet another version of the myth, he is raised by his cousin Macris on the island of Euboea.\nDionysus in Greek mythology is a god of foreign origin, and while Mount Nysa is a mythological location, it is invariably set far away to the east or to the south. The \"Homeric Hymn 1 to Dionysus\" places it \"far from Phoenicia, near to the Egyptian stream\". Others placed it in Anatolia, or in Libya (\"away in the west beside a great ocean\"), in Ethiopia (Herodotus), or Arabia (Diodorus Siculus).\nAccording to Herodotus:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As it is, the Greek story has it that no sooner was Dionysus born than Zeus sewed him up in his thigh and carried him away to Nysa in Ethiopia beyond Egypt; and as for Pan, the Greeks do not know what became of him after his birth. It is therefore plain to me that the Greeks learned the names of these two gods later than the names of all the others, and trace the birth of both to the time when they gained the knowledge.\u2014\u200a\nThe \"Bibliotheca\" seems to be following Pherecydes, who relates how the infant Dionysus, god of the grapevine, was nursed by the rain-nymphs, the Hyades at Nysa. Young Dionysus was also said to have been one of the many famous pupils of the centaur Chiron. According to Ptolemy Chennus in the Library of Photius, \"Dionysus was loved by Chiron, from whom he learned chants and dances, the bacchic rites and initiations.\"\nTravels and invention of wine.\nWhen Dionysus grew up, he discovered the culture of the vine and the mode of extracting its precious juice, being the first to do so; but Hera struck him with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Cybele, better known to the Greeks as Rhea, cured him and taught him her religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia teaching the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted several years. According to a legend, when Alexander the Great reached a city called Nysa near the Indus river, the locals said that their city was founded by Dionysus in the distant past and their city was dedicated to the god Dionysus. These travels took something of the form of military conquests; according to Diodorus Siculus he conquered the whole world except for Britain and Ethiopia.\nAnother myth according to Nonnus involves Ampelus, a satyr, who was loved by Dionysus. As related by Ovid, Ampelus became the constellation \"Vindemitor\", or the \"grape-gatherer\": Another story of Ampelus was related by Nonnus: in an accident foreseen by Dionysus, the youth was killed while riding a bull maddened by the sting of a gadfly sent by Selene, the goddess of the Moon. The Fates granted Ampelus a second life as a vine, from which Dionysus squeezed the first wine.\nReturn to Greece.\nReturning in triumph to Greece after his travels in Asia, Dionysus came to be considered the founder of the triumphal procession. He undertook efforts to introduce his religion into Greece, but was opposed by rulers who feared it, on account of the disorders and madness it brought with it.\nIn one myth, adapted in Euripides's play \"The Bacchae\", Dionysus returns to his birthplace, Thebes, which is ruled by his cousin Pentheus. Pentheus, as well as his mother Agave and his aunts Ino and Autonoe, disbelieve Dionysus's divine birth. Despite the warnings of the blind prophet Tiresias, they deny his worship and denounce him for inspiring the women of Thebes to madness.\nDionysus uses his divine powers to drive Pentheus insane, then invites him to spy on the ecstatic rituals of the Maenads, in the woods of Mount Cithaeron. Pentheus, hoping to witness a sexual orgy, hides himself in a tree. The Maenads spot him; maddened by Dionysus, they take him to be a mountain-dwelling lion and attack him with their bare hands. Pentheus's aunts and his mother Agave are among them, and they rip him limb from limb. Agave mounts his head on a pike and takes the trophy to her father Cadmus.\nEuripides's description of this sparagmos was as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"But she was foaming at the mouth, her eyes rolled all around; her mind was mindless now. Held by the god, she paid the man no heed. She grabbed his left arm just below the elbow: wedging her foot against the victim's ribs she ripped his shoulder off \u2013 not by mere force; the god made easy everything they touch. On his right arm worked Ino, ripping flesh; Autono\u00eb and the mob of maenads griped him, screaming as one. While he had breath, he cried, but they were whooping victory calls. One took an arm, a foot another, boot and all. They stripped his torso bare, staining their nails with blood, then tossed balls of flesh around. Pentheus' body lies in fragments now: on the hard rocks, and mingled with the leaves buried in the woodland, hard to find. His mother stumbled across his head: poor head! She grabbed it, and fixed it on her thyrsus, like a lions's, to wave in joyful triumph at her hunt.\"\nThe madness passes. Dionysus arrives in his true, divine form, banishes Agave and her sisters, and transforms Cadmus and his wife Harmonia into serpents. Only Tiresias is spared.\nIn the Iliad, when King Lycurgus of Thrace heard that Dionysus was in his kingdom, he imprisoned Dionysus's followers, the Maenads. Dionysus fled and took refuge with Thetis, and sent a drought which stirred the people to revolt. The god then drove King Lycurgus insane and had him slice his own son into pieces with an axe in the belief that he was a patch of ivy, a plant holy to Dionysus. An oracle then claimed that the land would stay dry and barren as long as Lycurgus lived, and his people had him drawn and quartered. Appeased by the king's death, Dionysus lifted the curse. In an alternative version, sometimes depicted in art, Lycurgus tries to kill Ambrosia, a follower of Dionysus, who was transformed into a vine that twined around the enraged king and slowly strangled him.\nCaptivity and escape.\nThe \"Homeric Hymn 7 to Dionysus\" recounts how, while he sat on the seashore, some sailors spotted him, believing him a prince. They attempted to kidnap him and sail away to sell him for ransom or into slavery. No rope would bind him. The god turned into a fierce lion and unleashed a bear on board, killing all in his path. Those who jumped ship were mercifully turned into dolphins. The only survivor was the helmsman, Acoetes, who recognised the god and tried to stop his sailors from the start.\nIn a similar story, Dionysus hired a Tyrrhenian pirate ship to sail from Icaria to Naxos. When he was aboard, they sailed not to Naxos but to Asia, intending to sell him as a slave. This time the god turned the mast and oars into snakes, and filled the vessel with ivy and the sound of flutes so that the sailors went mad and, leaping into the sea, were turned into dolphins. In Ovid's \"Metamorphoses,\" Bacchus begins this story as a young child found by the pirates but transforms to a divine adult when on board.\nMany of the myths involve Dionysus defending his godhead against skeptics. Malcolm Bull notes that \"It is a measure of Bacchus's ambiguous position in classical mythology that he, unlike the other Olympians, had to use a boat to travel to and from the islands with which he is associated\". Paola Corrente notes that in many sources, the incident with the pirates happens towards the end of Dionysus's time among mortals. In that sense, it serves as final proof of his divinity and is often followed by his descent into Hades to retrieve his mother, both of whom can then ascend into heaven to live alongside the other Olympian gods.\nDescent to the underworld.\nPausanias, in book II of his \"Description of Greece\", describes two variant traditions regarding Dionysus's katabasis, or descent into the underworld. Both describe how Dionysus entered into the afterlife to rescue his mother Semele, and bring her to her rightful place on Olympus. To do so, he had to contend with the hell dog Cerberus, which was restrained for him by Heracles. After retrieving Semele, Dionysus emerged with her from the unfathomable waters of a lagoon on the coast of the Argolid near the prehistoric site of Lerna, according to the local tradition. This mythic event was commemorated with a yearly nighttime festival, the details of which were held secret by the local religion. According to Paola Corrente, the emergence of Dionysus from the waters of the lagoon may signify a form of rebirth for both him and Semele as they reemerged from the underworld. A variant of this myth forms the basis of Aristophanes's comedy \"The Frogs\".\nAccording to the Christian writer Clement of Alexandria, Dionysus was guided in his journey by Prosymnus or Polymnus, who requested, as his reward, to be Dionysus's lover. Prosymnus died before Dionysus could honor his pledge, so to satisfy Prosymnus's shade, Dionysus fashioned a phallus from a fig branch and penetrated himself with it at Prosymnus's tomb. This story survives in full only in Christian sources, whose aim was to discredit pagan mythology, but it appears to have also served to explain the origin of secret objects used by the Dionysian Mysteries.\nThis same myth of Dionysus's descent to the underworld is related by both Diodorus Siculus in his first century BC work \"Bibliotheca historica\", and Pseudo-Apollodorus in the third book of his first century AD work \"Bibliotheca\". In the latter, Apollodorus tells how after having been hidden away from Hera's wrath, Dionysus traveled the world opposing those who denied his godhood, finally proving it when he transformed his pirate captors into dolphins. After this, the culmination of his life on earth was his descent to retrieve his mother from the underworld. He renamed his mother Thyone, and ascended with her to heaven, where she became a goddess. In this variant of the myth, it is implied that Dionysus must prove his godhood to mortals and then also legitimised his place on Olympus by proving his lineage and elevating his mother to divine status, before taking his place among the Olympic gods.\nSecondary myths.\nMidas's golden touch.\nDionysus discovered that his old school master and foster father, Silenus, had gone missing. The old man had wandered away drunk, and was found by some peasants who carried him to their king Midas (alternatively, he passed out in Midas's rose garden). The king recognised him hospitably, feasting him for ten days and nights while Silenus entertained with stories and songs. On the eleventh day, Midas brought Silenus back to Dionysus. Dionysus offered the king his choice of reward.\nMidas asked that whatever he might touch would turn to gold. Dionysus consented, though was sorry that he had not made a better choice. Midas rejoiced in his new power, which he hastened to put to the test. He touched and turned to gold an oak twig and a stone, but his joy vanished when he found that his bread, meat, and wine also turned to gold. Later, when his daughter embraced him, she too turned to gold.\nThe horrified king strove to divest the Midas Touch, and he prayed to Dionysus to save him from starvation. The god consented, telling Midas to wash in the river Pactolus. As he did so, the power passed into them, and the river sands turned gold: this etiological myth explained the gold sands of the Pactolus.\nLove affairs.\nWhen Theseus abandoned Ariadne sleeping on Naxos, Dionysus found and married her. They had a son named Oenopion, but she committed suicide or was killed by Perseus. In some variants, Dionysus had her crown put into the heavens as the constellation Corona; in others, he descended into Hades to restore her to the gods on Olympus. Another account claims Dionysus ordered Theseus to abandon Ariadne on the island of Naxos, for Dionysus had seen her as Theseus carried her onto the ship and had decided to marry her. Psalacantha, a nymph, promised to help Dionysus court Ariadne in exchange for his sexual favours; but Dionysus refused, so Psalacantha advised Ariadne against going with him. For this Dionysus turned her into the plant with the same name.\nDionysus fell in love with a nymph named Nicaea, in some versions by Eros's binding. Nicaea however was a sworn virgin and scorned his attempts to court her. So one day, while she was away, he replaced the water in the spring from which she used to drink with wine. Intoxicated, Nicaea passed out, and Dionysus raped her in her sleep. When she woke up and realised what had happened, she sought him out to harm him, but she never found him. She gave birth to his sons Telete, Satyrus, and others. Dionysus named the ancient city of Nicaea after her.\nIn Nonnus's \"Dionysiaca\", Eros made Dionysus fall in love with Aura, a virgin companion of Artemis, as part of a ploy to punish Aura for having insulted Artemis. Dionysus used the same trick as with Nicaea to get her fall asleep, tied her up, and then raped her. Aura tried to kill herself, with little success. When she gave birth to twin sons by Dionysus, Iacchus and another boy, she ate one twin before drowning herself in the Sangarius river.\nAlso in the \"Dionysiaca\", Nonnus relates how Dionysus fell in love with a handsome satyr named Ampelos, who was killed by Selene due to him challenging her. On his death, Dionysus changed him into the first grapevine. Elsewhere in the same epic, Dionysus arrives in Thrace to punish the impious king Sithon who slays all of his daughter Pallene's suitors; after a brief wrestling match with the princess herself, he defeats her, kills Sithon and beds the maiden.\nOther myths.\nAnother account about Dionysus's parentage indicates that he is the son of Zeus and G\u00ea (Gaia), also named \"Themel\u00ea\" (foundation), corrupted into \"Semele\".\nWhen Hephaestus bound Hera to a magical chair, Dionysus got him drunk and brought him back to Olympus after he passed out.\nDuring the Gigantomachy, Dionysus killed the giant Eurytus with his thyrsus.\nA third descent by Dionysus to Hades is invented by Aristophanes in his comedy \"The Frogs\". Dionysus, as patron of the Athenian dramatic festival, the \"Dionysia\", wants to bring back to life one of the great tragedians. After a poetry slam, Aeschylus is chosen in preference to Euripides.\nCallirho\u00eb was a lovely Calydonian woman who scorned Coresus, a priest of Dionysus, so he begged the god to avenge him, and Dionysus sent a plague that drove people insane before killing them. The oracle of Dodona decreed that Dionysus would only be appeased if Callirho\u00eb, or anyone willing to substitute her, was sacrificed to him. As Callirho\u00eb could not persuade anyone to take her place, she was led to the altar like a victim. Coresus was the one with the duty to sacrifice Callirho\u00eb, but he could not bring himself to do it and so he killed himself instead, becoming the substitute victim. In pity, Callirho\u00eb killed herself by a spring which was later named after her.\nDionysus also sent a fox that was fated never to be caught in Thebes. Creon, king of Thebes, sent Amphitryon to catch and kill the fox. Amphitryon obtained from Cephalus the dog that his wife Procris had received from Minos, which was fated to catch whatever it pursued.\nHyginus relates that Dionysus once gave human speech to a donkey. The donkey then proceeded to challenge Priapus in a contest about which between them had the better penis; the donkey lost. Priapus killed the donkey, but Dionysus placed him among the stars, above the Crab.\nChildren.\nThe following is a list of Dionysus's offspring, by various mothers. Beside each offspring, the earliest source to record the parentage is given, along with the century to which the source (in some cases approximately) dates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIconography and depictions.\nSymbols.\nThe earliest cult images of Dionysus show a mature male, bearded and robed. He holds a fennel staff, tipped with a pine-cone and known as a \"thyrsus\". Later images show him as a beardless, sensuous, naked or half-naked androgynous youth: the literature describes him as womanly or \"man-womanish\". In its fully developed form, his central cult imagery shows his triumphant, disorderly arrival or return, as if from some place beyond the borders of the known and civilised. His procession \"(thiasus)\" is made up of wild female followers (maenads) and bearded satyrs with erect penises; some are armed with the \"thyrsus\", some dance or play music. The god himself is drawn in a chariot, usually by exotic beasts such as lions or tigers, and is sometimes attended by a bearded, drunken Silenus. This procession is presumed to be the cult model for the followers of his Dionysian Mysteries. Dionysus is represented by city religions as the protector of those who do not belong to conventional society and he thus symbolises the chaotic, dangerous and unexpected, everything which escapes human reason and which can only be attributed to the unforeseeable action of the gods.\nDionysus was a god of resurrection and he was strongly linked to the bull. In a cult hymn from Olympia, at a festival for Hera, Dionysus is invited to come as a bull; \"with bull-foot raging\". Walter Burkert relates, \"Quite frequently [Dionysus] is portrayed with bull horns, and in Kyzikos he has a tauromorphic image\", and refers also to an archaic myth in which Dionysus is slaughtered as a bull calf and impiously eaten by the Titans.\nThe snake and phallus were symbols of Dionysus in ancient Greece, and of Bacchus in Greece and Rome. There is a procession called the \"phallophoria\", in which villagers would parade through the streets carrying phallic images or pulling phallic representations on carts. He typically wears a panther or leopard skin and carries a thyrsus. His iconography sometimes includes maenads, who wear wreaths of ivy and serpents around their hair or neck.\nThe cult of Dionysus was closely associated with trees, specifically the fig tree, and some of his bynames exhibit this, such as \"he in the tree\" or , \"he of the tree\". Peters suggests the original meaning as \"he who runs among the trees\", or that of a \"runner in the woods\". Janda (2010) accepts the etymology but proposes the more cosmological interpretation of \"he who impels the (world-)tree\". This interpretation explains how \"Nysa\" could have been re-interpreted from a meaning of \"tree\" to the name of a mountain: the axis mundi of Indo-European mythology is represented both as a world-tree and as a world-mountain.\nDionysus is also closely associated with the transition between summer and autumn. In the Mediterranean summer, marked by the rising of the dog star Sirius, the weather becomes extremely hot, but it is also a time when the promise of coming harvests grow. Late summer, when Orion is at the center of the sky, was the time of the grape harvest in ancient Greece. Plato describes the gifts of this season as the fruit that is harvested as well as Dionysian joy. Pindar describes the \"pure light of high summer\" as closely associated with Dionysus and possibly even an embodiment of the god himself. An image of Dionysus's birth from Zeus's thigh calls him \"the light of Zeus\" (\"Dios phos\") and associates him with the light of Sirius.\nClassical art.\nThe god, and still more often his followers, were commonly depicted in the painted pottery of Ancient Greece, much of which made to hold wine. But, apart from some reliefs of maenads, Dionysian subjects rarely appeared in large sculpture before the Hellenistic period, when they became common. In these, the treatment of the god himself ranged from severe archaising or Neo Attic types such as the Dionysus Sardanapalus to types showing him as an indolent and androgynous young man, often nude. \"Hermes and the Infant Dionysus\" is probably a Greek original in marble, and the Ludovisi Dionysus group is probably a Roman original of the second century AD. Well-known Hellenistic sculptures of Dionysian subjects, surviving in Roman copies, include the Barberini Faun, the Belvedere Torso, the \"Resting Satyr\". The Furietti Centaurs and \"Sleeping Hermaphroditus\" reflect related subjects, which had by this time become drawn into the Dionysian orbit. The marble Dancer of Pergamon is an original, as is the bronze Dancing Satyr of Mazara del Vallo, a recent recovery from the sea.\nThe Dionysian world by the Hellenistic period is a hedonistic but safe pastoral into which other semi-divine creatures of the countryside have been co-opted, such as centaurs, nymphs, and the gods Pan and Hermaphrodite. \"Nymph\" by this stage \"means simply an ideal female of the Dionysian outdoors, a non-wild bacchant\". Hellenistic sculpture also includes for the first time large genre subjects of children and peasants, many of whom carry Dionysian attributes such as ivy wreaths, and \"most should be seen as part of his realm. They have in common with satyrs and nymphs that they are creatures of the outdoors and are without true personal identity.\" The fourth-century BC Derveni Krater, the unique survival of a very large scale Classical or Hellenistic metal vessel of top quality, depicts Dionysus and his followers.\nDionysus appealed to the Hellenistic monarchies for a number of reasons, apart from merely being a god of pleasure: He was a human who became divine, he came from, and had conquered, the East, exemplified a lifestyle of display and magnificence with his mortal followers, and was often regarded as an ancestor. He continued to appeal to the rich of Imperial Rome, who populated their gardens with Dionysian sculpture, and by the second century AD were often buried in sarcophagi carved with crowded scenes of Bacchus and his entourage.\nThe fourth-century AD Lycurgus Cup in the British Museum is a spectacular cage cup which changes colour when light comes through the glass; it shows the bound King Lycurgus being taunted by the god and attacked by a satyr; this may have been used for celebration of Dionysian mysteries. Elizabeth Kessler has theorised that a mosaic appearing on the triclinium floor of the House of Aion in Nea Paphos, Cyprus, details a monotheistic worship of Dionysus. In the mosaic, other gods appear but may only be lesser representations of the centrally imposed Dionysus. The mid-Byzantine Veroli Casket shows the tradition lingering in Constantinople around 1000 AD, but probably not very well understood.\nEarly modern art.\nBacchic subjects in art resumed in the Italian Renaissance, and soon became almost as popular as in antiquity, but his \"strong association with feminine spirituality and power almost disappeared\", as did \"the idea that the destructive and creative powers of the god were indissolubly linked\". In Michelangelo's statue (1496\u201397) \"madness has become merriment\". The statue tries to suggest both drunken incapacity and an elevated consciousness, but this was perhaps lost on later viewers, and typically the two aspects were thereafter split, with a clearly drunk Silenus representing the former, and a youthful Bacchus often shown with wings, because he carries the mind to higher places.\nTitian's \"Bacchus and Ariadne\" (1522\u201323) and \"The Bacchanal of the Andrians\" (1523\u201326), both painted for the same room, offer an influential heroic pastoral, while Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in \"The Triumph of Bacchus\" (or \"Los borrachos\" \u2013 \"the drinkers\", c. 1629) and Jusepe de Ribera in his \"Drunken Silenus\" choose a genre realism. Flemish Baroque painting frequently painted the Bacchic followers, as in Van Dyck's \"Drunken Silenus\" and many works by Rubens; Poussin was another regular painter of Bacchic scenes.\nA common theme in art beginning in the sixteenth century was the depiction of Bacchus and Ceres caring for a representation of love \u2013 often Venus, Cupid, or Amore. This tradition derived from a quotation by the Roman comedian Terence (c. 195/185 \u2013 c. 159 BC) which became a popular proverb in the Early Modern period: \"Sine Cerere et Baccho friget Venus\" (\"without Ceres and Bacchus, Venus freezes\"). Its simplest level of meaning is that love needs food and wine to thrive. Artwork based on this saying was popular during the period 1550\u20131630, especially in Northern Mannerism in Prague and the Low Countries, as well as by Rubens. Because of his association with the vine harvest, Bacchus became the god of autumn, and he and his followers were often shown in sets depicting the seasons.\nModern literature and philosophy.\nDionysus has remained an inspiration to artists, philosophers and writers into the modern era. In \"The Birth of Tragedy\" (1872), the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed that a tension between Apollonian and Dionysian aesthetic principles underlay the development of Greek tragedy; Dionysus represented what was unrestrained chaotic and irrational, while Apollo represented the rational and ordered. This concept of a rivalry or opposition between Dionysus and Apollo has been characterised as a \"modern myth\", as it is the invention of modern thinkers like Nietzsche and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, and is not found in classical sources. However, the acceptance and popularity of this theme in Western culture has been so great, that its undercurrent has influenced the conclusions of classical scholarship.\nNietzsche also claimed that the oldest forms of Greek Tragedy were entirely based upon the suffering Dionysus. In Nietzsche's 1886 work \"Beyond Good and Evil\", and later \"The Twilight of the Idols\", \"The Antichrist\" and \"Ecce Homo\", Dionysus is conceived as the embodiment of the unrestrained will to power. Towards the end of his life, Nietzsche famously went mad. He was known to sign letters as both Dionysus and \"The Crucified\" in this period of his life. In \"The Hellenic Religion of the Suffering God\" (1904), and \"Dionysus and Early Dionysianism\" (1921), the poet Vyacheslav Ivanov elaborates the theory of Dionysianism, tracing the origins of literature, and tragedy in particular, to ancient Dionysian mysteries. Ivanov said that Dionysus's suffering \"was the distinctive feature of the cult\" just as Christ's suffering is significant for Christianity. Karl Ker\u00e9nyi characterises Dionysus as representative of the psychological life force (Greek \"Zo\u00ea\"). Other psychological interpretations place Dionysus's emotionality in the foreground, focusing on the joy, terror or hysteria associated with the god. Sigmund Freud specified that his ashes should be kept in an Ancient Greek vase painted with Dionysian scenes from his collection, which remains on display at Golders Green Crematorium in London.\nModern film and performance art.\nIn 1969, an adaption of \"The Bacchae\" was performed, called \"Dionysus in '69\". A film was made of the same performance. The production was notable for involving audience participation, nudity, and theatrical innovations.\nIn 1974, Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove adapted Aristophanes's comedy \"The Frogs\" into a modern musical, which hit broadway in 2004 and was revived in London in 2017. The musical keeps the descent of Dionysus into Hades to bring back a playwright; however, the playwrights are updated to modern times, and Dionysus is forced to choose between George Bernard Shaw and William Shakespeare.\nIn 2019, the South Korean boy band BTS released a rap-rock-synth-pop-hip hop track. named \"Dionysus\" as part of their album \"\". The naming of this song comes from the association of the namesake with debauchery and excess, this is reflected in its lyrics talking about \"getting drunk on art\" \u2013 playing on the Korean words for \"alcohol\" (\uc220 \"sul\") and \"art\" (\uc608\uc220 \"yesul\") as an example \u2013 alongside expressions about their stardom, legacy, and artistic integrity.\nIn 2024, French actor and singer Phillippe Katerine portrayed a blue and near naked Dionysus at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in France.\nParallels with Christianity.\nSome scholars of comparative mythology identify both Dionysus and Jesus with the dying-and-rising god mythological archetype. On the other hand, it has been noted that the details of Dionysus's death and rebirth are starkly different both in content and symbolism from Jesus. The two stories take place in very different historical and geographic contexts. Also, the manner of death is different; in the most common myth, Dionysus was torn to pieces and eaten by the Titans, but \"eventually restored to a new life\" from the heart that was left over.\nAnother parallel can be seen in \"The Bacchae\" where Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity, which is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by Pontius Pilate. However, a number of scholars dispute this parallel, since the confrontation between Dionysus and Pentheus ends with Pentheus dying, torn into pieces by the mad women, whereas the trial of Jesus ends with him being sentenced to death.\nE. Kessler has argued that the Dionysian cult developed into strict monotheism by the fourth century AD; together with Mithraism and other sects, the cult formed an instance of \"pagan monotheism\" in direct competition with Early Christianity during Late Antiquity. Scholars from the sixteenth century onwards, especially Gerard Vossius, also discussed the parallels between the biographies of Dionysus/Bacchus and Moses.\nJohn Moles has argued that the Dionysian cult influenced early Christianity, and especially how Christians understood themselves as a new religion centered around a savior deity.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He held world championships in four weight classes: Lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight. Duran also reigned as the undisputed and lineal lightweight champion and the lineal welterweight champion. He is also the second boxer to have competed over a span of five decades, the first being Jack Johnson. Dur\u00e1n was known as a versatile, technical brawler and pressure fighter, which earned him the nickname \"Manos de Piedra\" (\"Hands of Stone\") for his formidable punching power and excellent defense. Dur\u00e1n is regarded by many as one of the greatest boxers of all time.\n\"The Sporting News\" recognized Dur\u00e1n as the Fighter of the Decade for the 1970s. In 2002, Dur\u00e1n was voted by \"The Ring\" magazine as the fifth greatest fighter of the last 80 years, while boxing historian Bert Sugar rated him as the eighth greatest fighter of all time. The Associated Press voted him as the best lightweight of the 20th century, with many considering him the greatest lightweight of all time. Dur\u00e1n retired for good in January 2002 at age 50, following a car crash in Argentina in October 2001, after which he had required life saving surgery. He had previously retired in November 1980, June 1984 and August 1998, only to change his mind. Dur\u00e1n ended his career with a professional record of 119 fights, 103 wins, and 70 knockouts. From May 1971 up until his second fight against Sugar Ray Leonard in November 1980, Dur\u00e1n was trained by legendary boxing trainer Ray Arcel.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nRoberto Dur\u00e1n was born on June 16, 1951, in Guarar\u00e9, Panama. His mother, Clara Samaniego, was a native of Guarar\u00e9 and his father, Margarito Duran, an American of Mexican heritage was stationed in Panama for the U.S. Army at the time of Roberto's birth. He was raised in the slums of El Chorrillo in the district \"La Casa de Piedra\" (The House of Stone), in Panama City. He began sparring with experienced boxers at the Neco de La Guardia gymnasium when he was only eight years old. He had the nickname \"Cholo\" because of his mixed heritage.\nDur\u00e1n competed as an amateur beginning in February 1965. He compiled a record of 29\u20133 (other sources say 18\u20133 or 13\u20133), with all 3 losses coming in Dur\u00e1n's first 3 amateur fights.\nProfessional career.\nLightweight.\nDur\u00e1n made his professional debut in February 1968 at the age of 16. He was given the nickname \"Manos de Piedra\", \"hands of stone,\" by Panamanian boxing writer Alfonso Castillo, after defeating Benny Huertas on September 13, 1971. Following this bout, he was then trained by Ray Arcel.\nDur\u00e1n won his first 31 consecutive professional fights, and scored knockout victories over future Featherweight Champion Ernesto Marcel and former Super Featherweight Champion Hiroshi Kobayashi. He fought his first title bout in June 1972, where he defeated Ken Buchanan at Madison Square Garden for the WBA Lightweight Championship. Dur\u00e1n, as a 2-to-1 underdog, scored a knockdown against the defending champion just fifteen seconds into the opening round and battered him throughout the bout. He was well ahead on all three cards as the bell rang to end the 13th round, at which time Dur\u00e1n (apparently not hearing the bell) continued to throw a couple of extra punches as Buchanan lay on the ropes. As Dur\u00e1n continued punching, the referee, Johnny LoBianco, grabbed him to pull him away. He pulled down on Dur\u00e1n's arms, which led to a seemingly accidental low blow. Buchanan dropped to the canvas in pain. His trainer Gil Clancy later said he had believed the blow to have been caused by a knee. Dur\u00e1n was not disqualified from the bout; instead, he was deemed as winner by thirteenth-round technical knockout. Columnist Red Smith of \"The New York Times\" wrote that LoBianco had to award the victory to Dur\u00e1n, even if the punch was a low blow, as \"anything short of pulling a knife is regarded indulgently\" in American boxing. Buchanan said he left the fight \"with sore balls\".\nDur\u00e1n followed up on his title winning performance with several non-title matches. Later that year, in another non-title bout, he lost a ten-round decision to Esteban De Jes\u00fas. Dur\u00e1n got back on track with successful title defenses against Jimmy Robertson, Hector Thompson and future Lightweight Champion Guts Ishimatsu. In 1974, Dur\u00e1n avenged his loss to De Jes\u00fas with a brutal eleventh round knock out. In 1976, he defeated future Light Welterweight Champion Saoul Mamby. Overall, Dur\u00e1n made twelve successful defenses of his title (eleven coming by knockout) and amassed a record of 62\u20131. His last defense was in 1978, when Dur\u00e1n fought a third bout with De Jesus in a unification match wherein Dur\u00e1n once again knocked out De Jesus and captured his WBC Lightweight Championship. Dur\u00e1n later visited De Jes\u00fas in 1989 when De Jes\u00fas was dying of AIDS. \u201cWhen I see him there so thin, my tears run out because he used to be a muscular guy,\" Dur\u00e1n said. \"I start crying and I hug him, and I kiss him and I tell my daughter to kiss him.\u201d The picture of their embrace was widely distributed, at a time when AIDS patients faced significant stigma.\nDur\u00e1n gave up the Undisputed Lightweight Championship in February 1979.\nWelterweight and The Brawl in Montreal.\nVacating the Lightweight title was a buildup for an attempt at the Welterweight title. Dur\u00e1n earned wins against former WBC Welterweight Champion Carlos Palomino and Zeferino Gonzales, among others. These victories set the stage for a title bout against then-undefeated WBC Welterweight Champion Sugar Ray Leonard. The venue chosen was the Olympic Stadium in Montreal (the same location where Leonard won an Olympic gold medal during the 1976 Summer Olympics). Dur\u00e1n resented the fact that he was getting only one-fifth of the money that Leonard was getting, despite the fact that Dur\u00e1n was entering the bout with an incredible 71\u20131 record and seen by many as the best boxer of the decade of the 1970s. To the surprise of Leonard and his camp, who had expected a warm homecoming from the place where Leonard had won Olympic gold, Leonard only got a mixed reception in Montreal, while Dur\u00e1n was incredibly popular with the crowd, with Leonard later admitting that Dur\u00e1n's popularity in Canada \"threw me for a loop\". On June 20, 1980, Dur\u00e1n captured the WBC Welterweight title by defeating Leonard via a 15-round unanimous decision (145\u2013144, 148\u2013147, 146\u2013144), although it was incorrectly announced as a majority decision in the ring with the 148\u2013147 scorecard being incorrectly announced as 147\u2013147. The fight became known as \"The Brawl in Montreal\".\n\"No M\u00e1s\" in New Orleans.\nAfter defeating Leonard in Montreal, Dur\u00e1n gained iconic status in his home country, Panama. Leonard initiated the rematch clause and asked for the fight to be the following November. In their second fight, Leonard successfully changed his tactics, using more footwork and movement than he had in their first fight, and Dur\u00e1n was unable to get Leonard against the ropes. During the seventh round, after Leonard had gained a slight lead on the scorecards, he began taunting and mocking Dur\u00e1n. Towards the end of the eighth round, Dur\u00e1n suddenly stopped fighting, and according to referee Octavio Meyran and ABC commentator Howard Cosell, Dur\u00e1n repeatedly said \"No m\u00e1s\" (\"no more\"), which was denied by Dur\u00e1n, his cornermen Ray Arcel and Freddie Brown, and his manager Carlos Eleta, with Dur\u00e1n claiming he had said \"No quiero pelear con el payaso\" (\"I do not want to fight with this clown [Leonard]\"). According to Meyran, in addition to saying \"No m\u00e1s\", Dur\u00e1n also said in broken English \"I don't box anymore\". In a 2016 interview, Dur\u00e1n claimed that what he actually said was, \"No sigo\" (\"I won't go on\"). For a brief time after the \"No m\u00e1s\" debacle, Dur\u00e1n retired from boxing, but soon changed his mind, not wanting to end his career on such a bad note.\nLight middleweight and middleweight.\nHe took some time to recover from that fight and gained even more weight to contend for the WBC Light Middleweight title, but losing in his first attempt at a championship in that division on January 30, 1982, against Wilfred Ben\u00edtez by a 15-round unanimous decision; this after having defeated Nino Gonzalez and Luigi Minchillo, two rated Light Middleweights, both by ten-round decisions in non-title bouts. Dur\u00e1n was also to lose his comeback fight in September 1982 in Detroit. Kirkland Laing, from London, shocked the boxing world, producing the type of display his talents promised yet he so rarely produced, taking the split decision. After being relegated to a 10-round walk out win over Englishman Jimmy Batten at The Battle of The Champions in Miami, Dur\u00e1n signed with promoter Bob Arum. This marked the beginning of a comeback in which he beat former world champion and now hall of famer Jos\u00e9 Cuevas via a fourth round knock-out, which earned him a second crack at the light middleweight title, this time against WBA Champion Davey Moore.\nThe WBA title bout took place at Madison Square Garden on June 16, 1983, which also happened to be Dur\u00e1n's 32nd birthday. The still inexperienced Moore (12\u20130) was game through the first three rounds, but by the 4th, Dur\u00e1n said he knew Moore couldn't hurt him, and an onslaught began.&lt;ref name=\"http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1120968/1/index.htm\"&gt;He That Was Lost Has Been Found, \"Sports Illustrated\", June 27, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The pro-Dur\u00e1n crowd at ringside cheered as Dur\u00e1n relentlessly punished Moore. By the end of the sixth round, Moore's eye had swollen shut and he was floored near the end of the seventh. Finally the fight was stopped in the eighth round as Moore was taking a horrific beating and Dur\u00e1n won his third world title. After the victory, Dur\u00e1n was hoisted up in the air as the crowd sang \"Happy Birthday\" to a sobbing Dur\u00e1n.\nDur\u00e1n later fought for the World Middleweight Championship, meeting Marvelous Marvin Hagler in Las Vegas on November 10, 1983. During the fight, Duran broke his hand and lost in a very competitive fight that went the full fifteen rounds. After 13 rounds, two of the judges had Dur\u00e1n one point ahead, and the other judge had it even. Hagler fought tenaciously to win the final two rounds and get a unanimous decision victory. The judges' scores were 144\u2013142, 144\u2013143, and 146\u2013145. Despite the loss, Dur\u00e1n became the second man to take Hagler to a fifteen-round decision (Vito Antuofermo was the other) and the only one to do so while Hagler was the world champion.\nIn June 1984, Dur\u00e1n was stripped of his Light Middleweight title when the WBA did not approve of his fight with WBC Champion Thomas \"Hitman\" Hearns and took away recognition of Dur\u00e1n as world champion the moment Dur\u00e1n stepped into the ring to box Hearns. Hearns dropped Dur\u00e1n twice in the first round and as he rose to his feet after the second knockdown, which ended the round, the former champion did not know where his corner was. Hearns went on to knock Dur\u00e1n down a third time in the second round and the fight was stopped, marking the first time in his career that Dur\u00e1n had been knocked out in a fight (the \"No M\u00e1s\" fight was officially recorded as a technical knockout, because Dur\u00e1n quit). Dur\u00e1n then retired for a second time, but changed his mind over a year later, and was back fighting in early 1986.\nDur\u00e1n did not contend another title fight until 1989, but made the shot count when he won the WBC Middleweight title from Iran Barkley in February. The fight is considered one of Dur\u00e1n's greatest achievements, as the 37-year-old former lightweight champion took the middleweight crown, his fourth title. In a tough, back-and-forth fight, Dur\u00e1n knocked Barkley down in the eleventh round and Dur\u00e1n won a split decision (118\u2013112, 116\u2013112, 113\u2013116). The bout was named the 1989 \"Fight of the Year\" by \"The Ring\".\nSuper middleweight.\nDuran moved up to super middleweight for a third fight with Sugar Ray Leonard in December 1989 (a fight dubbed \"Uno M\u00e1s\" \u2014 One More \u2014 by promoters). Leonard's WBC super-middleweight title was on the line, although Leonard's camp insisted that the fight with Dur\u00e1n be at a 162lbs catchweight instead of the 168lbs super-middleweight limit that Dur\u00e1n favoured. In the end, both weighed in below the 160lbs middleweight limit. Dur\u00e1n was uncharacteristically flat for most of what was a strange fight. Although Leonard won the fight by a wide unanimous decision (120\u2013110, 119\u2013109, 116\u2013111), by the end of the fight Leonard looked the worse for wear as he had suffered several bad cuts. Leonard's lip was busted by a headbutt in the fourth round, his left eye was cut in the eleventh round and his right eye was cut in the twelfth round. The cuts required more than 60 stitches. Dur\u00e1n didn't fight again until 1991, so had given up his WBC middleweight crown that he had won against Barkley. Dur\u00e1n seemed to be in decline after the third fight against Leonard, but he persisted and worked his way into title shots for the lesser IBC super-middleweight and middleweight titles in 1994, 1995 and 1996.\nDur\u00e1n fought Vinny Pazienza twice, in June 1994 and January 1995, for the IBC Super Middleweight Championship, with Pazienza winning both times by unanimous decision. In the first fight, Dur\u00e1n put Pazienza down in Rounds 2 and 5, but referee Joe Cortez controversially ruled the Round 2 knockdown to be a slip. The first fight divided the people watching as some felt that Dur\u00e1n had won a close fight, but others felt that Pazienza had won either narrowly or widely after finishing strongly in the last five rounds. The second fight was more lopsided in Pazienza's favour, as despite the official judges giving Pazienza the win by scores of 116\u2013112, 117\u2013111 and 118\u2013110, the TV commentators expressed puzzlement at the closeness of the official scoring as they thought that Pazienza had won every round in a 120\u2013108 shutout.\nIn 1996, Dur\u00e1n fought H\u00e9ctor Camacho for the vacant IBC Middleweight Championship. At the end of the fight, fans and TV commentators seemed in complete agreement that Dur\u00e1n had won the fight in an excellent performance, but the three judges saw the fight very differently and awarded Camacho the victory by a very controversial unanimous decision. Dur\u00e1n's old rival, Sugar Ray Leonard, commentating at ringside, was baffled at the scoring and called it an early Christmas gift for Camacho, with the result motivating Leonard enough to come out of a 6-year boxing retirement to face Camacho himself in 1997. In 1997, Dur\u00e1n was defeated by former champion Jorge Castro in Argentina. Dur\u00e1n then fought Castro in a rematch bout in Panama and won via unanimous decision, maintaining his unbeaten record in Panama.\nIn 1998, at the age of 47, he challenged 28-year-old WBA Middleweight Champion William Joppy. Joppy, a trim, quick-fisted fighter, battered Dur\u00e1n to defeat in just 3 rounds. It was Dur\u00e1n's most emphatic loss since the Hearns fight, over a decade earlier. Dur\u00e1n then announced his retirement for the third time in August 1998, but soon changed his mind and was back fighting in March 1999.\nIn June 2000, Dur\u00e1n avenged a previous loss to Pat Lawlor from 9 years before and won the NBA Super Middleweight Championship on his 49th birthday. He lost the title a year later to H\u00e9ctor Camacho in a rematch bout and in what would be Dur\u00e1n's final fight.\nRetirement.\nIn October 2001, Dur\u00e1n traveled to Argentina to promote a salsa music CD that he had just released. While there, he was involved in a car crash and required life-saving surgery. After that incident, he announced his retirement from boxing at the age of 50.\nAnnouncing his retirement, Dur\u00e1n cited the weight issues of his friend, Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona, as motivation for getting back in shape, stating \"as of now, I am exercising so that when the [retirement] honors arrive the people will see me in shape. I don't want to [look] like Maradona did, all fat.\"\nDur\u00e1n's five world title belts, which he won in four different divisions, were stolen from his house in Panama in 1993 during a robbery allegedly staged by his brother-in-law, who gave them to memorabilia seller Luis Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez, who stood trial for trying to sell stolen goods. Gonz\u00e1lez B\u00e1ez allegedly sold the belts to undercover FBI agents. He alleged that Dur\u00e1n authorized the sale of the five belts to him during a time that Dur\u00e1n was facing financial trouble. On September 23, 2003, a federal judge in Florida ordered the five belts returned to Dur\u00e1n.\nHis 70 wins by knockout place him in an exclusive group of boxers who have won 50 or more fights by knockout. He is ranked number 28 on \"The Ring\"'s list of 100 greatest punchers of all time.\nOn October 14, 2006, Dur\u00e1n was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Riverside, California, and on June 10, 2007, into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in Canastota, New York.\nIn June 2020, Dur\u00e1n was diagnosed with COVID-19 after going to hospital with common cold symptoms. Dur\u00e1n underwent treatment for the disease. Coincidentally, the diagnosis came on the 48th anniversary of Dur\u00e1n's first world title victory against Ken Buchanan, which took place on June 26, 1972. He was released from the hospital weeks later.\nToday he is the brand ambassador of Panama Blue, Panama's premium bottled water.\nDur\u00e1n is a licensed ultralight aircraft pilot in Panama. He flew a Quick Silver MX model.\nDur\u00e1n's daughter, Irichelle Dur\u00e1n, was a professional boxer herself who garnered a record of one win and two losses in three bouts, with one win by knockout. She is a resident of Puerto Rico.\nIn March 2024, it was revealed that Dur\u00e1n suffers a heart problem known as atrioventricular blockage, He had surgery on Monday 18 March in Panama to have a pacemaker placed in his chest.\nIn media and popular culture.\nFilm.\nDur\u00e1n's first appearance in a movie was in the 1979 film \"Rocky II\" as a lightning-fast sparring partner for Rocky Balboa. Outside of this, Dur\u00e1n had a minor role in \"Harlem Nights\". Al Pacino was inspired by Dur\u00e1n in developing his characterization of Tony Montana in \"Scarface\".\nDur\u00e1n's life and boxing career are told in the documentary \"Los pu\u00f1os de una naci\u00f3n\" (\"The Fists of a Nation\") by Panamanian filmmaker Pituka Ortega-Heilbron. Dur\u00e1n also appears very briefly during an interview for the documentary \"The Panama Deception\" (1992), in which he recounts his experience during the United States invasion of Panama.\nThe biopic \"Hands of Stone\" stars \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez as Dur\u00e1n, Robert De Niro as Ray Arcel and Usher as Sugar Ray Leonard, and was released on August 26, 2016.\nTelevision.\nDur\u00e1n played the drug lord Jes\u00fas Maroto in \"Miami Vice\" season two, episode 19.\nIn \"Corporate Warriors\", the fourth episode of the second season of the hit American crime drama \"\", Dur\u00e1n is mentioned by the medical examiner while discussing a dead man found to have bone grafts put in his hands to boost his punching power.\nMusic.\nThe song \"The Eyes of Roberto Dur\u00e1n\" by Tom Russell, from the album \"The Long Way Around\", contains the lyric, \"Panama City \u2013 it's three in the morning; they're talking 'bout the Hands of Stone.\"\nDur\u00e1n is mentioned in the third verse of Nas' original demo for \"It Ain't Hard to Tell\" in the line: \"Metaphors of murder man, hittin' like Roberto Dur\u00e1n, hold the mic in my hand, my lifespan.\"\nThe musician Jackie Leven recorded a song (\"Museum of Childhood\") that explores the events of the second world title fight between Dur\u00e1n and Sugar Ray Leonard.\nJazz musician Miles Davis, an avid boxing fan, recorded a tribute to Roberto Dur\u00e1n titled \"Duran\".\nDur\u00e1n is also mentioned in the third verse of Paul Thorn's \"Hammer and Nail,\" based on Thorn's nationally televised fight with Dur\u00e1n:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I climbed in the ring with Roberto Dur\u00e1n and the punches began to rain down\nHe hit me with a dozen hard uppercuts and my corner threw in the towel\nI asked him why he had to knock me out and he summed it up real well\nHe said, 'I'd rather be a hammer than a nail'&lt;/poem&gt;\nTexas rockabilly band Reverend Horton Heat mentions Dur\u00e1n in their song \"Eat Steak,\" off of their album \"Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em\".\nDur\u00e1n is mentioned in the salsa song \"Pa'l Bailador\" by Colombian singer Joe Arroyo in 1989, \"A Roberto Duran, Aya en Panama, Mano de Piedra!\" (To Roberto Duran, in Panama, Hands of Stones!)\nDur\u00e1n is referenced multiple times in the song \"Uno Mas\" by Alex Soria's band Chino.\nDur\u00e1n's 1983 fight with Davey Moore is referenced in the 2014 single, \"The Possum,\" by American songwriter, Sun Kil Moon (i.e. Mark Kozelek), who often writes about boxers.

{"id": "63330", "revid": "40240973", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63330", "title": "Railway Mania", "text": "Speculative frenzy in the UK in the 1840s about railways\nRailway Mania was a stock market bubble in the railway industry of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in the 1840s. It followed a common pattern: as the price of railway shares increased, speculators invested more money, which further increased the price of railway shares, until the share price collapsed. The mania reached its zenith in 1846, when 263 Acts of Parliament for setting up new railway companies were passed, with the proposed routes totalling . About a third of the railways authorised were never built\u2014the companies either collapsed because of poor financial planning, were bought out by larger competitors before they could build their line, or turned out to be fraudulent enterprises to channel investors' money into other businesses.\nCauses.\nThe world's first recognizably modern inter-city railway, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (the L&amp;M), opened in 1830 and proved to be successful for transporting both passengers and freight. In the late 1830s and early 1840s, the British economy slowed. Interest rates rose, making it more attractive to invest money in government bonds\u2014the main source of investment at the time\u2014and political and social unrest deterred banks and businesses from investing the huge sums of money required to build railways; the L&amp;M cost \u00a3637,000 (\u00a3 adjusted for 2015).\nBy the mid-1840s, the economy was improving and the manufacturing industries were once again growing. The Bank of England cut interest rates, making government bonds less attractive investments, and existing railway companies' shares began to boom as they moved ever-increasing amounts of cargo and people, making people willing to invest in new railways.\nCrucially, there were more investors in British business. The Industrial Revolution was creating a new, increasingly affluent middle class. While earlier business ventures had relied on a small number of banks, businessmen and wealthy aristocrats for investment, a prospective railway company also had a large, literate section of population with savings to invest. In 1825 the government had repealed the Bubble Act, brought in during the near-disastrous South Sea Bubble of 1720, which had put close limits on the formation of new business ventures and, importantly, had limited joint stock companies to a maximum of five separate investors. With these limits removed, anyone could invest money (and hopefully earn a return) on a new company, and railways were heavily promoted as a foolproof venture. New media such as newspapers and the emergence of the modern international financial and trade markets made it easy for companies to promote themselves and provide the means for the general public to invest. Shares could be purchased for a 10% deposit, with the railway company holding the right to call in the remainder at any time. The railways were so heavily promoted as a foolproof venture that thousands of investors on modest incomes bought large numbers of shares, whilst only being able to afford the deposit. Many families invested their entire savings in prospective railway companies\u2014and many of those lost everything when the bubble collapsed and the companies called in the remainder of their due payments.\nThe British government promoted an almost totally 'laissez-faire' system of non-regulation in the railways. Companies had to submit a bill to Parliament to gain the right to acquire land for the line, which required the route of the proposed railway to be approved, but there were no limits on the number of companies and no real checks on the financial viability of a line. Anyone could form a company, gain investment and submit a bill to Parliament. Since many Members of Parliament (MPs) were heavy investors in such schemes, it was rare for a bill to not pass during the peak of the mania in 1846, although Parliament did reject schemes that were blatantly misleading or impossible to construct.\nMagnates like George Hudson developed routes in the North and Midlands by amalgamating small railway companies and rationalising routes. He was also an MP, but ultimately failed because of his fraudulent practices of, for example, paying dividends from capital.\nThe end of the mania.\nAs with other bubbles, the Railway Mania became a self-promoting cycle based purely on over-optimistic speculation. As the dozens of companies formed began to operate and the simple unviability of many of them became clear, investors began to realise that railways were not all as lucrative and as easy to build as they had been led to believe. Coupled to this, in late 1845 the Bank of England increased interest rates. As banks began to re-invest in bonds, the money began to flow out of railways, undercutting the boom.\nThe share prices of railways slowed in their rise, then leveled out. As they began to fall, investment stopped virtually overnight, leaving numerous companies without funding and numerous investors with no prospect of any return on their investment. The larger railway companies such as the Great Western Railway and the nascent Midland began to buy up strategic failed lines to expand their network. These lines could be purchased at a fraction of their real value as given a choice between a below-value offer for their shares or the total loss of their investment, shareholders naturally chose the former. Many middle-class families on modest incomes had sunk their entire savings into new companies during the mania, and they lost everything when the speculation collapsed.\nThe boom-and-bust cycle of early-industrial Britain was still in effect, and the boom that had created the conditions for Railway Mania began to cool and then a decline set in. The number of new railway companies fell away to almost nothing in the late 1840s and early 1850s, with the only new lines constructed being by the large companies. Economic upturns in the 1850s and 1860s saw smaller booms in railway construction, but these never reached anywhere near the scale of the mania\u2014partly because of more thoughtful (if still very limited) government control, partly because of more cautious investors and partly because the UK railway network was approaching maturity, with none of the 'blank canvas' available to numerous companies as in the 1840s.\nResults.\nUnlike some stock market bubbles, there was a net tangible result from all the investment: a vast expansion of the British railway system, though perhaps at an inflated cost. Amongst the high number of impractical, overambitious and downright fraudulent schemes promoted during the mania were a good number of practical trunk routes (most notably the initial part of the Great Northern Railway and the trans-Pennine Woodhead route) and important freight lines (such as large parts of what would become the North Eastern Railway). These projects all required vast amounts of capital, all of which had to be raised from private enterprise. The speculative frenzy of the mania made people much more willing to invest the large sums required for railway construction than they had been previously or would be in later years. Even many of the routes that failed when the mania collapsed became viable (if not lucrative) when each was in the hands of the larger company that had purchased it. A total of of railway line were built as a result of projects authorised between 1844 and 1846\u2014by comparison, the total route mileage of the modern UK railway network is around .\nComparisons.\nRailway and Canal Mania can be compared with a similar mania in the 1990s in the stock of telecom companies. The telecom mania resulted in the installation and deployment of a vast amount of fibre-optic telecommunications infrastructure, spurred on from the realisation that the same railway rights-of-way could make affordable conduits for fibre optics. Yet another boom occurred in the period 1995\u20132000, during the development of the Internet, when many companies were established to promote new services on the growing network. The dot-com bubble collapsed in 2000, and the much more extensive telecoms bubble in 2002 with the bankruptcies of Enron, WorldCom, Global Crossing and QWest, although some platform companies such as Google and Amazon grew and prospered, diversifying into backbone fibre networks and cloud computing services.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His long reign of 62 years is not only the longest of any Iberian monarch, but one of the longest monarchical reigns in history, ahead of Hirohito but remaining behind Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria, and Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and King Louis XIV \nKing James I saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the southeast, and Valencia to the south. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he achieved the renunciation of any possible claim of French suzerainty over the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties, while he renounced northward expansion and taking back the once Catalan territories in Occitania and vassal counties loyal to the County of Barcelona, lands that were lost by his father Peter II of Aragon in the Battle of Muret during the Albigensian Crusade and annexed by the Kingdom of France, and then decided to turn south. His great part in the \"Reconquista\" was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. One of the main reasons for this formal renunciation of most of the once Catalan territories in Languedoc and Occitania, and any expansion into them, is that he was raised by the Knights Templar Crusaders, who had defeated his father, who was fighting for the Pope alongside the French. It was thus effectively forbidden for him to try to maintain the traditional influence of the Count of Barcelona that previously existed in Occitania and Languedoc.\nAs a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the European kings. King James I compiled the \"Llibre del Consolat de Mar\", which governed maritime trade and helped establish Aragonese supremacy in the western Mediterranean. He was an important figure in the development of the Catalan language, sponsoring Catalan literature and writing a quasi-autobiographical chronicle of his reign: the \"Llibre dels fets\".\nEarly life and reign until majority.\nJames was born at Montpellier as the only son of Peter II of Aragon and Marie of Montpellier. As a child, James was made a pawn in the power politics of Provence, where his father was engaged in struggles helping the Cathar heretics of Albi against the Albigensian Crusade led by Simon IV de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, who were trying to exterminate them. Peter endeavoured to placate the northern Crusaders by arranging a marriage between his two-year-old son James and Simon's daughter, Amicie de Montfort. He entrusted the boy to be educated in Montfort's care in 1211, but was soon forced to take up arms against him, dying at the Battle of Muret on 12 September 1213. Montfort would willingly have used James as a means of extending his own power had not the Aragonese appealed to Pope Innocent III, who insisted that Montfort surrender him. James was handed over to the papal legate Peter of Benevento at Carcassonne in May or June 1214.\nJames was then sent to Monz\u00f3n, where he was entrusted to the care of Guillem de Montred\u00f3, the head of the Knights Templar in Aragon and Provence; the regency meanwhile fell to his great-uncle Sancho, Count of Roussillon, and his son, the king's cousin, Nu\u00f1o. The kingdom was given over to confusion until, in 1217, the Templars and some of the more loyal nobles brought the young king to Zaragoza.\nIn 1221, he was married to Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile. The next six years of his reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcal\u00e1 of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms.\nAcquisition of Urgell.\nIn 1228, James faced the sternest opposition yet from a vassal. Guerau IV de Cabrera occupied the County of Urgell in opposition to Aurembiax, the heiress of Ermengol VIII, who had died without sons in 1208. Although Aurembiax's mother, Elvira, had made herself a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of James's father, upon her death in 1220 Guerau occupied the county and displaced Aurembiax, claiming that a woman could not inherit.\nJames intervened on behalf of Aurembiax, to whom he owed protection. He bought Guerau off and allowed Aurembiax to reclaim her territory, which she did at Lleida, probably also becoming one of James' earliest mistresses. She surrendered Lleida to James and agreed to hold Urgell in fief for him. On her death in 1231, James exchanged the Balearic Islands for Urgell with her widower, Peter of Portugal.\nRelations with France and Navarre.\nFrom 1230 to 1232, James negotiated with Sancho VII of Navarre, who desired his help against his nephew and closest living male relative, Theobald IV of Champagne. James and Sancho negotiated a treaty whereby James would inherit Navarre on the old Sancho's death, but when this occurred in 1234, the Navarrese nobles elevated Theobald to the throne instead, and James disputed it. Pope Gregory IX was required to intervene. In the end, James accepted Theobald's succession.\nJames endeavoured to form a state straddling the Pyrenees in order to counterbalance the power of France north of the river Loire. As with the much earlier Visigothic attempt, this policy was victim to physical, cultural, and political obstacles. As in the case of Navarre, he declined to launch into perilous adventures. By the Treaty of Corbeil, signed in May 1258, he ended his conflict with Louis IX of France, securing the renunciation of any historical French claims to sovereignty over Catalonia, including the County of Barcelona. On July 17, James renounced his hereditary rights to the County of Provence (then an imperial fief) in favor of Margaret, daughter of his uncle Ramon Berenguer V. Margaret was the wife of Louis IX of France and hence Provence became officially part of France. Thus, as a result of the treaty the House of Barcelona was separated from the politics of southern France and the strong ties that had linked Catalonia and Languedoc faded \nReconquest.\nAfter his false start at uniting Aragon with the Kingdom of Navarre through a scheme of mutual adoption, James turned to the south and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea. On 5 September 1229, the troops from Aragon, consisting of 155 ships, 1,500 horsemen and 15,000 soldiers, set sail from Tarragona, Salou, and Cambrils, in southern Catalonia, to conquer Majorca from Abu Yahya, the semi-independent Almohad governor of the island. Although a group of Aragonese knights took part in the campaign because of their obligations to the king, the conquest of Majorca was mainly a Catalan undertaking, and Catalans would later make up the majority of Majorca's settlers. James conquered Majorca on 31 December 1229, and Menorca (1232) and Ibiza (1235) were later acquired during the reconquest.\nValencia capitulated to Aragonese rule on 28 September 1238, following an extensive campaign that included the Siege of Burriana and the decisive Battle of the Puig, where the Aragonese commander, Bernat Guillem I d'Enten\u00e7a, who was also the king's cousin, died from wounds received in action.\nChroniclers say James used gunpowder in the siege of Museros castle.\nDuring his remaining two decades after Corbeil, James warred with the Moors in Murcia, on behalf of his son-in-law Alfonso X of Castile. On 26 March 1244, the two monarchs signed the Treaty of Almizra to establish their zones of expansion into Andalusia so as to prevent squabbling between them. Specifically, it defined the borders of the newly created Kingdom of Valencia. James signed it on that date, but Alfonso did not affirm it until much later. According to the treaty, all lands south of a line from Biar to Villajoyosa through Busot were reserved for Castile.\nCrusade of 1269.\nAbaqa, the \"Khan of Tartary\" (actually the Ilkhan), corresponded with James in early 1267, inviting him to join forces with the Mongols and go on crusade. James sent an ambassador to Abaqa in the person of Jayme Alaric de Perpignan, who returned with a Mongol embassy in 1269. Pope Clement IV tried to dissuade James from crusading, regarding his moral character as sub-par, and Alfonso X did the same. Nonetheless, James, who was then campaigning in Murcia, made peace with Muhammad I, the Sultan of Granada, and set about collecting funds for a crusade. After organising the government for his absence and assembling a fleet at Barcelona in September 1269, he was ready to sail east. The troubadour Olivier lo Templier composed a song praising the voyage and hoping for its success. A storm, however, drove him off course, and he landed at Aigues-Mortes. According to the continuator of William of Tyre, he returned via Montpellier \"por l'amor de sa dame Berenguiere\" (\"for the love of his lady Berengaria\") and abandoned any further effort at a crusade.\nJames's sons Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez and Fern\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, who had been given command of part of the fleet, did continue on their way to Acre, where they arrived in December. They found that Baibars, the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt, had broken his truce with the Kingdom of Jerusalem and was making a demonstration of his military power in front of Acre. During the demonstration, Egyptian troops hidden in the bushes ambushed a returning Frankish force that had been in Galilee. James's sons, initially eager for a fight, changed their minds after this spectacle and returned home via Sicily, where Fern\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez was knighted by Charles of Anjou.\nPatronage of art, learning, and literature.\nJames built and consecrated the Cathedral of Lleida, which was constructed in a style transitional between Romanesque and Gothic with little influence from Moorish styles.\nJames was a patron of the University of Montpellier, which owed much of its development to his impetus. He also founded a \"studium\" at Valencia in 1245 and received privileges for it from Pope Innocent IV, but it did not develop as splendidly. In 1263, James presided over a debate in Barcelona between the Jewish rabbi Nahmanides and Pablo Christiani, a prominent \"converso\".\nJames was the first great sponsor and patron of vernacular Catalan literature. Indeed, he may himself be called \"the first of the Catalan prose writers.\" James wrote or dictated at various stages a chronicle of his own life in Catalan, \"Llibre dels fets\", the first autobiography by a Christian king. As well as being a fine example of autobiography, the \"Book of Deeds\" expresses concepts of the power and purpose of monarchy, examples of loyalty and treachery in the feudal order, and medieval military tactics. More controversially, some historians have looked at these writings as a source of Catalan identity, separate from that of Occitania and Rome.\nJames also wrote the \"Libre de la Saviesa\" or \"Book of Wisdom.\" The book contains proverbs from various authors, reaching from the time of King Solomon to nearly his own time with Albertus Magnus. It even contains maxims from the medieval Arab philosophers and from the \"Apophthegmata Philosophorum\" of Honein ben Ishak, which was probably translated at Barcelona during his reign. A Hebrew translator by the name of Jehuda was employed at James's court during this period.\nThough James was himself a prose writer and sponsored mostly prose works, he had an appreciation of verse. In consequence of the Albigensian Crusade, many troubadours were forced to flee southern France and many found refuge in Aragon. Notwithstanding his early patronage of poetry, by the influence of his confessor Ramon de Penyafort, James brought the Inquisition into his realm in 1233 to prevent any vernacular translation of the Bible.\nSuccession.\nThe favour James showed his illegitimate offspring led to protest from the nobles, and to conflicts between his legitimate and illegitimate sons. When one of the latter, Fern\u00e1n S\u00e1nchez, who had behaved with gross ingratitude and treason toward his father, was slain by the legitimate son Peter, the old king recorded his grim satisfaction.\nIn his will, James divided his states between his sons by Yolanda of Hungary: the aforementioned Peter received the Hispanic possessions on the mainland and James received the Kingdom of Majorca, which included the Balearic Islands, the counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya, and the Lordship of Montpellier. The division inevitably produced fratricidal conflicts. In 1276, the king fell very ill at Alzira and resigned his crown, intending to retire to the monastery of Poblet, but he died at Valencia on 27 July.\nHis mummified body was later exhumed in 1856, when the monastery was under repair. A photograph of the king was taken. The photograph of the head of the mummy clearly shows the wound in the left eyebrow that the king himself explained in a passage from his Llibre dels fets (Book of Deeds):\nAs I was coming with the men, I happened to turn my head towards the town in order to look at the Saracens, who had come out in great force, when a cross-bowman shot at me, and hit me beside the sun-hood, and the shot struck me on the head, the bolt lighting near the forehead. It was God's will it did not pass through the head, but the point of the arrow went half through it. In anger I struck the arrow so with my hand that I broke it: the blood came out down my face; I wiped it off with a mantle of \"sendal\" I had, and went away laughing, that the army might not take alarm.\nMarriages and children.\nJames first married, in 1221, Eleanor, daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. Though he later had the marriage annulled, his one son by her was declared legitimate:\nIn 1235, James remarried to Yolanda, daughter of Andrew II of Hungary by his second wife Yolande de Courtenay. They had numerous children:\nJames married thirdly Teresa Gil de Vidaure, but only by a private document, and left her when (as he claimed) she developed leprosy.\nThe children in the third marriage were recognised in his last will as being in the line of succession to the throne, should the senior lines fail.\nJames also had several lovers, both during and after his marriages, and fathered several illegitimate sons.\nBy Blanca d'Antill\u00f3n:\nBy Berenguela Fern\u00e1ndez:\nBy Elvira Sarroca:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This property is commonly associated with philosophy, theology, aspects of existence, and similar concepts that are inherently \"too great\", complex or abstract to be communicated adequately. Illogical statements, principles, reasons and arguments may be considered intrinsically ineffable along with impossibilities, contradictions and paradoxes.\nAn object, event or concept is ineffable if it cannot adequately be expressed by the use of natural language.\nThe term (Latin: \"ineff\u0101bilis\") is composed of the prefix \"in-\", meaning 'not', and adjective \"eff\u0101bilis\", meaning 'capable of being expressed'. In Greek, \u1f04\u03c1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (\u03b1 depritive + \u1fe5\u03b7\u03c4\u1f78\u03c2) means 'what cannot or should not be spoken of'.\nTerminology describing the nature of experience cannot be conveyed properly in dualistic symbolic language; it is believed that this knowledge is only held by the individual from which it originates. Profanity and vulgarisms can easily and clearly be stated, but by those who believe they should not be said, they are considered ineffable. Thus, one method of describing something that is ineffable is by using apophasis, i.e. describing what it is \"not\", rather than what it \"is\". An example is the name of God in Judaism, written as YHWH but substituted with Adonai (\"the Lord\") or HaShem (\"the name\") when reading.\nIn the Roman Catholic Church.\nThe ineffability about God is affirmed by the First Vatican Council's apostolic constitution \"Dei Filius\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The holy Catholic Apostolic Roman Church believes and confesses that there is one true and living God, Creator and Lord of heaven and earth, almighty, eternal, immense, \"incomprehensible\", infinite in intelligence, in will, and in all perfection, who, as being one, sole, absolutely simple and immutable spiritual substance, is to be declared as really and essentially distinct from the world, of supreme beatitude in and from Himself, and \"ineffably exalted above all things which exist, or are conceivable, except Himself\".\u2014\u200a\nGod's ineffability deals with His being infinite, invisible and incomprehensible.\nThis dogmatic definition comes from a longtime tradition: Tertullian, Athenagoras of Athens, and Clement of Alexandria believed that ineffability is a property of God.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Clarke\nChildhood's End is a 1953 science fiction novel by the British author Arthur\u00a0C. Clarke. The story follows a peaceful alien invasion of Earth by mysterious Overlords, whose arrival begins decades of apparent utopia under indirect alien rule, at the cost of human identity and culture.\nClarke's idea for the book began with his short story \"Guardian Angel\" (published in \"New Worlds\" #8, winter 1950), which he expanded into a novel in 1952, incorporating it as the first part of the book, \"Earth and the Overlords\". Completed and published in 1953, \"Childhood's End\" sold out its first printing, received good reviews and became Clarke's first successful novel. The book is often regarded by both readers and critics as Clarke's best novel and is described as \"a classic of alien literature\". Along with \"The Songs of Distant Earth\" (1986), Clarke considered \"Childhood's End\" to be one of his favourites of his own novels. The novel was nominated for the Retro Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2004.\nSeveral attempts to adapt the novel into a film or miniseries have been made with varying levels of success. Director Stanley Kubrick expressed interest in the 1960s, but collaborated with Clarke on \"\" (1968) instead. The novel's theme of transcendent evolution also appears in Clarke's \"Space Odyssey\" series. In 1997, the BBC produced a two-hour radio dramatization of \"Childhood's End\" that was adapted by Tony Mulholland. The Syfy Channel produced a three-part, four-hour television miniseries of \"Childhood's End\", which was broadcast on 14\u201316 December 2015.\nPlot summary.\nIn the late 20th century, the United States and the Soviet Union are competing to launch the first spacecraft into orbit when alien spaceships suddenly position themselves above Earth's principal cities. After one week, the aliens announce they are assuming supervision of international affairs, to prevent humanity's extinction. They become known as the Overlords. In general, they let humans go on conducting their affairs in their own way, although some humans are suspicious of the Overlords' benign intent, as they never allow themselves to be seen.\nThe Overlord Karellen, the \"Supervisor for Earth\", periodically meets with Rikki Stormgren, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Karellen tells Stormgren that the Overlords will reveal themselves in 50 years, when humanity will have become used to their presence. When the Overlords finally reveal their appearance, they resemble the traditional Christian folk images of demons, with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and barbed tails. Humankind enters a golden age of prosperity at the expense of creativity.\nThe Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose is part of their anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. The Ouija board reveals a number which Jan recognizes as a star-catalogue number and learns that it is consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. Jan stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light years to their home planet.\nWell over a century after the Overlords' arrival, human children, beginning with the Greggsons', begin to display clairvoyance and telekinetic powers. Karellen reveals the Overlords' purpose: they serve the Overmind, a vast cosmic intelligence, as a kind of \"bridge species\", fostering other races' eventual union with it.\nAs Rashaverak explains, the time of humanity as a race composed of single individuals with a concrete identity is coming to an end. The children's minds reach into each other and merge into a single vast group consciousness. For the transformed children's safety, they are segregated on a continent of their own. No more human children are born and many parents die or commit suicide.\nWhen Jan Rodricks returns to Earth, he finds a profoundly altered planet. Humanity has effectively become extinct and he is now the last individual man alive. Some Overlords remain on Earth to study the children from a safe distance. When the evolved children mentally alter the Moon's rotation and make other planetary manipulations, it becomes too dangerous to remain. The departing Overlords offer to take Rodricks with them, but he chooses to stay to witness Earth's end and transmit a report of what he sees. His transmission ends with a view of a column of light stretching into the sky, the Earth becoming transparent, and a glow from within the core just before the Earth explodes, its energy siphoned by the departing children.\nAs his ship speeds away, Karellen somberly turns his back on a display of the sun.\nPublication history.\nDevelopment.\nThe novel first took shape in July 1946, when Clarke wrote \"Guardian Angel\", a short story that would eventually become Part\u00a0I of \"Childhood's End\". Clarke's portrayal of the Overlords as devils was influenced by John W. Campbell's depiction of the devilish Teff-Hellani species in \"The Mightiest Machine\", first serialized in \"Astounding Stories\" in 1934. After finishing \"Guardian Angel\", Clarke enrolled at King's College London and served as the chairman of the British Interplanetary Society from 1946 to 1947 and from 1951 to 1953. He earned a first-class degree in mathematics and physics from King's in 1948, after which he worked as an assistant editor for \"Science Abstracts\". \"Guardian Angel\" was submitted for publication but was rejected by several editors, including Campbell. At the request of Clarke's agent and unbeknown to Clarke, the story was edited by James Blish, who rewrote the ending. Blish's version of the story was accepted for publication in April 1950 by \"Famous Fantastic Mysteries\" magazine. Clarke's original version of \"Guardian Angel\" was later published in the Winter 1950 issue of \"New Worlds\" magazine.\nAfter Clarke's nonfiction science book \"The Exploration of Space\" (1951) was successfully received, he began to focus on his writing career. In February 1952, Clarke started working on the novelization of \"Guardian Angel\"; he completed a first draft of the novel \"Childhood's End\" in December, and a final revision in January 1953. Clarke travelled to New York in April 1953 with the novel and several of his other works. Literary agent Bernard Shir-Cliff convinced Ballantine Books to buy everything Clarke had, including \"Childhood's End\", \"Encounter in the Dawn\" (1953), (which Ballantine retitled \"Expedition to Earth\"), and \"Prelude to Space\" (1951). However, Clarke had composed two different endings for the novel, and the last chapter of \"Childhood's End\" was still not finished. Clarke proceeded to Tampa Bay, Florida, to go scuba diving with George Grisinger, and on his way there visited his friend Frederick C. Durant \u2013 President of the International Astronautical Federation from 1953 to 1956 \u2013 and his family in the Washington Metropolitan Area, whilst he continued working on the last chapter. He next traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, where he visited Ian Macauley, a friend who was active in the civil rights movement. Clarke finished the final chapter in Atlanta while Clarke and Macauley discussed racial issues; these conversations may have influenced the development of the last chapter, particularly Clarke's choice to make the character of Jan Rodricks \u2013 the last surviving member of the human species \u2013 a black man.\nClarke arrived in Florida at the end of April. The short story, \"The Man Who Ploughed the Sea\", included in the \"Tales from the White Hart\" (1957) collection, was influenced by his time in Florida. While in Key Largo in late May, Clarke met Marilyn Mayfield, and after a romance lasting less than three weeks, they travelled to Manhattan and married at New York City Hall. The couple spent their honeymoon in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where Clarke proofread \"Childhood's End\". In July, Clarke returned to England with Mayfield, but it quickly became clear that the marriage would not last as Clarke spent most of his time reading and writing, and talking about his work. Further, Clarke wanted to be a father, and Marilyn, who had a son from a previous marriage, informed Clarke after their marriage that she could no longer have children. When \"Childhood's End\" was published the following month, it appeared with a dedication: \"To Marilyn, For letting me read the proofs on our honeymoon.\" The couple separated after a few months together, but remained married for the next decade.\nPublication.\nBallantine wanted to publish \"Childhood's End\" before \"Expedition to Earth\" and \"Prelude to Space\", but Clarke wanted to wait. He felt that it was a difficult book to release. He had written two different endings for the novel and was unsure of which to use. According to biographer Neil McAleer, Clarke's uncertainty may have been because of its thematic focus on the paranormal and transcendence with the alien Overmind. While the theme was used effectively by Clarke in the novel, McAleer wrote that \"it was not science fiction based on science, which he came to advocate and represent\". When he wrote \"Childhood's End\", Clarke was interested in the paranormal, and did not become a sceptic until much later in his life. Ballantine persuaded Clarke to let them publish \"Childhood's End\" first, and it was published in August 1953, with a cover designed by American science fiction illustrator Richard M. Powers. \"Childhood's End\" first appeared in paperback and hardcover editions, with the paperback as the primary edition, an unusual approach for the 1950s. For the first time in his career, Clarke became known as a novelist.\nDecades later, Clarke was preparing a new edition of \"Childhood's End\" after the story had become dated. The initial chapter of the 1953 novel correctly foresees a race between the US and Soviet Union to first land men on the Moon (and the prominence of German rocket scientists in both space programs), but sets it later than it would actually happen (post-1975; the exact year is not given in the text, but 1945 is said to be more than thirty years ago). After the book was first published, the Apollo missions landed humans on the Moon in 1969, and in 1989 US President George H. W. Bush announced the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI), calling for astronauts to eventually explore Mars. In 1990, Clarke added a new foreword and rewrote the first chapter, placing it in the early 21st century, changing the goal from the Moon to Mars, and implying a joint effort rather than a race. Editions since have appeared with the original opening or have included both versions. \"Guardian Angel\" has also appeared in two short story collections: \"The Sentinel\" (1983), and \"The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke\" (2001).\nOn October 28, 2008, Audible released a 7-hour 47 minute unabridged audiobook version of \"Childhood's End\", narrated by Eric Michael Summerer, under its Audible Frontiers imprint. An \"AudioFile\" review commended Summerer's narration as \"smoothly presented and fully credible\". An audio introduction and commentary is provided by Canadian science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer.\nReception.\nThe novel was well received by most readers and critics. Two months after publication, all 210,000 copies of the first printing had been sold. \"The New York Times\" published two positive reviews of the book: Basil Davenport compared Clarke to Olaf Stapledon, C. S. Lewis, and H. G. Wells, a \"very small group of writers who have used science fiction as the vehicle of philosophic ideas\". William DuBois called the book \"a first rate tour de force that is well worth the attention of every thoughtful citizen in this age of anxiety\". Don Guzman of the \"Los Angeles Times\" admired the novel for its suspense, wisdom, and beauty. He compared Clarke's role as a writer to that of an artist, \"a master of sonorous language, a painter of pictures in futuristic colors, a Chesley Bonestell with words\". \"Galaxy\" reviewer Groff Conklin called the novel \"a formidably impressive job\u00a0...\u00a0a continuous kaleidoscope of the unexpected\".\nWhile acknowledging \"inexpressible unpleasant and uncomfortable feelings after reading it\", Japanese author Yukio Mishima declared, \"I'm not afraid to call it a masterpiece.\"\nAnthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas were more sceptical, and faulted the novel's \"curious imbalance between its large-scale history and a number of episodic small-scale stories\". While praising Clarke's work as \"Stapledonian [for] its historic concepts and also for the quality of its prose and thinking\", they concluded that \"Childhood's End\" was \"an awkward and imperfect book\". P. Schuyler Miller said the novel was \"all imagination and poetry\", but concluded it was \"not up to some of Clarke's other writing\" due to weakness in its \"episodic structure\".\nBrian W. Aldiss and David Wingrove wrote that \"Childhood's End\" rested on \"a rather banal philosophical idea...expressed in simple but aspiring language that vaguely recalls the Psalms combined with a dramatized sense of loss [for] undeniable effect\".\nIn 2004 \"Childhood's End\" was nominated for a retrospective Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1954. In 2021, the novel was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by Royal Mail to feature on a series of UK postage stamps.\nAdaptations.\nIn the 1960s, director Stanley Kubrick was interested in making a film adaptation of the novel, but blacklisted director Abraham Polonsky had already optioned it. Instead, Kubrick collaborated with Clarke on adapting the short story \"The Sentinel\" into what eventually became \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968). Months before his performance at Woodstock in 1969, folk singer and guitarist Richie Havens told \"Ebony\" magazine about his appreciation of Clarke's story and expressed his interest in working on a future film adaptation of \"Childhood's End\". Screenplays by Polonsky and Howard Koch were never made into films.\nDavid Elgood first proposed a radio adaptation of the novel in 1974, but nothing came of it in that decade.\nPhilip DeGuere, whose credits include the TV series \"Alias Smith and Jones\", developed a script in the late 1970s for Universal, who planned to film it initially as a six-hour mini-series for CBS Television, and later as a two- or three-hour telemovie for ABC. However, Universal discovered that its contracts with Arthur C. Clarke \u2013 some of which dated back to 1957 \u2013 were out of date. These contractual difficulties were resolved in 1979 and DeGuere worked with legendary comic book artist Neal Adams on preproduction drawings and other material. The project had Clarke's approval. However Universal decided that the budget required would be nearly $40 million and they were only prepared to spend $10 million, so the movie was not made.\nDirector Brian Lighthill revisited the radio adaptation proposal and obtained the rights in 1995. After Lighthill received a go-ahead from BBC Radio in 1996, he commissioned a script from Tony Mulholland, resulting in a new, two-part adaptation. The BBC produced the two-hour radio dramatization of the novel, and broadcast it on BBC Radio 4 in November 1997. The recording was released on cassette by BBC Audiobooks in 1998 and on CD in 2007.\nAs of 2002[ [update]], film rights to the novel were held by Universal Pictures, with director Kimberly Peirce attached to a project.\nOn April 10, 2013, the Syfy Channel announced its plans to develop a \"Childhood's End\" TV miniseries. The three-episode, four-hour production premiered December 14, 2015. Charles Dance portrays the Supervisor Karellen.\nAn illustration of an Overlord as depicted by artist Wayne Barlowe was published in \"Barlowe's Guide to Extraterrestrials\".\nLegacy.\n\"Childhood's End\" has inspired the work of many contemporary musicians and artists. These include Pink Floyd (\"Childhood's End\"), Van der Graaf Generator (\"Childlike Faith in Childhood's End\"), David Bowie (\"Oh! You Pretty Things\"), and Genesis (\"Watcher of the Skies\"). The novel also inspired the Hipgnosis cover art for Led Zeppelin's \"Houses of the Holy\".\n\"Childhood's End\" was a major influence on the 1998 Square game \"Xenogears\", namely with the game's antagonist being named after Karellen.\nThe sixth episode of the 2023 Netflix series \"Gamera Rebirth\" was titled \"Childhood\u2019s end\" as an homage to Arthur C. Clarke.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63337", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63337", "title": "Supersaturation", "text": "State of a solution that contains more solute than can be dissolved at equilibrium\nIn physical chemistry, supersaturation occurs with a solution when the concentration of a solute exceeds the concentration specified by the value of solubility at equilibrium. Most commonly the term is applied to a solution of a solid in a liquid, but it can also be applied to liquids and gases dissolved in a liquid. A supersaturated solution is in a metastable state; it may return to equilibrium by separation of the excess of solute from the solution, by dilution of the solution by adding solvent, or by increasing the solubility of the solute in the solvent.\nHistory.\nEarly studies of the phenomenon were conducted with sodium sulfate, also known as Glauber's Salt because, unusually, the solubility of this salt in water decreases with increasing temperature past 33\u00b0C. Early studies have been summarised by Tomlinson. It was shown that the crystallization of a supersaturated solution does not simply come from its agitation, (the previous belief) but from solid matter entering and acting as a \"starting\" site for crystals to form, now called \"seeds\" (for more information, see nucleation). Expanding upon this, Gay-Lussac brought attention to the kinematics of salt ions and the characteristics of the container having an impact on the supersaturation state. He was also able to expand upon the number of salts with which a supersaturated solution can be obtained. Later Henri L\u00f6wel came to the conclusion that both nuclei of the solution and the walls of the container have a catalyzing effect on the solution that cause crystallization. Explaining and providing a model for this phenomenon has been a task taken on by more recent research. D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Gernez contributed to this research by discovering that nuclei must be of the same salt that is being crystallized in order to promote crystallization.\nFurthermore, in 1950, Victor K. LaMer proposed another theory for nucleation, in which he described the nucleation and growth of sulfur nuclei in a solution where a chemical reaction provided a constant inflow of molecularly dissolved sulfur. This theory, however, is not confined to this specific case and can be generalised as shown in LaMer\u2019s diagram, provided in the second figure of this section.\nIn section (I), the concentration of solute grows linearly, as it is formed (or added) to the solution. Upon reaching formula_1, it will become saturated, but it won\u2019t start depositing solute right away. Instead, it will keep absorbing it, becoming supersaturated. \nIn section (II), concentration reaches critical saturation levels, formula_2, when solute crystals begin nucleating. The appearance of nuclei partially relieves the supersaturation, at least rapidly enough that the rate of nucleation falls almost immediately to zero. The system rapidly reaches a balance between the solute supply and the consumption rate for the nucleation and its growth, slowing down the increase in its concentration. After reaching the peak, the curve declines owing to the increasing consumption of the solute for the growth of nuclei and reaches again the critical level of nucleation, formula_2, ending the nucleation stage. Given optimal conditions, having the solute be introduced to the solution very steadily while keeping the system free from perturbations and nucleation seeds, the maximum concentration that can be achieved in this way is defined as formula_4. \nIn section (III), the supersaturation becomes too low for any more crystals to nucleate, so no new crystals are formed. However, as the solution is still supersaturated, the existing crystals grow by solute diffusion. As time passes by, the growth rate of the crystal equals the rate of solute supply, so the concentration converges to the saturation value formula_1.\nOccurrence and examples.\nSolid precipitate, liquid solvent.\nA solution of a chemical compound in a liquid will become supersaturated when the temperature of the saturated solution is changed. In most cases solubility decreases with decreasing temperature; in such cases the excess of solute will rapidly separate from the solution as crystals or an amorphous powder. \nIn a few cases the opposite effect occurs. The example of sodium sulfate in water is well-known and this was why it was used in early studies of solubility.\nRecrystallization is a process used to purify chemical compounds. A mixture of the impure compound and solvent is heated until the compound has dissolved. If there is some solid impurity remaining it is removed by filtration. When the temperature of the solution is subsequently lowered it briefly becomes supersaturated and then the compound crystallizes out until chemical equilibrium at the lower temperature is achieved. Impurities remain in the supernatant liquid. In some cases crystals do not form quickly and the solution remains supersaturated after cooling. This is because there is a thermodynamic barrier to the formation of a crystal in a liquid medium. Commonly this is overcome by adding a tiny crystal of the solute compound to the supersaturated solution, a process known as \"seeding\". Another process in common use is to rub a rod on the side of a glass vessel containing the solution to release microscopic glass particles which can act as nucleation centres. In industry, centrifugation is used to separate the crystals from the supernatant liquid.\nSome compounds and mixtures of compounds can form long-living supersaturated solutions. Carbohydrates are a class of such compounds; The thermodynamic barrier to formation of crystals is rather high because of extensive and irregular hydrogen bonding with the solvent, water. For example, although sucrose can be recrystallised easily, its hydrolysis product, known as \"invert sugar\" or \"golden syrup\" is a mixture of glucose and fructose that exists as a viscous, supersaturated, liquid. Clear honey contains carbohydrates which may crystallize over a period of weeks.\nSupersaturation may be encountered when attempting to crystallize a protein.\nGaseous solute, liquid solvent.\nThe solubility of a gas in a liquid increases with increasing gas pressure. When the external pressure is reduced, the excess gas comes out of solution.\nFizzy drinks are made by subjecting the liquid to carbon dioxide, under pressure. In champagne the CO2 is produced naturally in the final stage of fermentation. When the bottle or can is opened some gas is released in the form of bubbles.\nRelease of gas from supersaturated tissues can cause an underwater diver to suffer from decompression sickness (a.k.a. the bends) when returning to the surface. This can be fatal if the released gas obstructs critical blood supplies causing ischaemia in vital tissues.\nDissolved gases can be released during oil exploration when a strike is made. This occurs because the oil in oil-bearing rock is under considerable pressure from the over-lying rock, allowing the oil to be supersaturated with respect to dissolved gases.\nLiquid formation from a mixture of gases.\nA cloudburst is an extreme form of production of liquid water from a supersaturated mixture of air and water vapour in the atmosphere. Supersaturation in the vapour phase is related to the surface tension of liquids through the Kelvin equation, the Gibbs\u2013Thomson effect and the Poynting effect.\nThe International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS) provides a special equation for the Gibbs free energy in the metastable-vapor region of water in its \"Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam\". All thermodynamic properties for the metastable-vapor region of water can be derived from this equation by means of the appropriate relations of thermodynamic properties to the Gibbs free energy.\nMeasurement.\nWhen measuring the concentration of a solute in a supersaturated gaseous or liquid mixture it is obvious that the pressure inside the cuvette may be greater than the ambient pressure. When this is so a specialized cuvette must be used. The choice of analytical technique to use will depend on the characteristics of the analyte.\nApplications.\nThe characteristics of supersaturation have practical applications in terms of pharmaceuticals. By creating a supersaturated solution of a certain drug, it can be ingested in liquid form. The drug can be made driven into a supersaturated state through any normal mechanism and then prevented from precipitating out by adding precipitation inhibitors. Drugs in this state are referred to as \"supersaturating drug delivery services,\" or \"SDDS.\" Oral consumption of a drug in this form is simple and allows for the measurement of very precise dosages. Primarily, it provides a means for drugs with very low solubility to be made into aqueous solutions. In addition, some drugs can undergo supersaturation inside the body despite being ingested in a crystalline form. This phenomenon is known as in vivo supersaturation.\nThe identification of supersaturated solutions can be used as a tool for marine ecologists to study the activity of organisms and populations. Photosynthetic organisms release O2 gas into the water. Thus, an area of the ocean supersaturated with O2 gas can likely determined to be rich with photosynthetic activity. Though some O2 will naturally be found in the ocean due to simple physical chemical properties, upwards of 70% of all oxygen gas found in supersaturated regions can be attributed to photosynthetic activity.\nSupersaturation in vapor phase is usually present in the expansion process through steam nozzles that operate with superheated steam at the inlet, which transitions to saturated state at the outlet. Supersaturation thus becomes an important factor to be taken into account in the design of steam turbines, as this results in an actual mass flow of steam through the nozzle being about 1 to 3% greater than the theoretically calculated value that would be expected if the expanding steam underwent a reversible adiabatic process through equilibrium states. In these cases supersaturation occurs due to the fact that the expansion process develops so rapidly and in such a short time, that the expanding vapor cannot reach its equilibrium state in the process, behaving as if it were superheated. Hence the determination of the expansion ratio, relevant to the calculation of the mass flow through the nozzle, must be done using an adiabatic index of approximately 1.3, like that of the superheated steam, instead of 1.135, which is the value that should have to be used for a quasi-static adiabatic expansion in the saturated region.\nThe study of supersaturation is also relevant to atmospheric studies. Since the 1940s, the presence of supersaturation in the atmosphere has been known. When water is supersaturated in the troposphere, the formation of ice lattices is frequently observed. In a state of saturation, the water particles will not form ice under tropospheric conditions. It is not enough for molecules of water to form an ice lattice at saturation pressures; they require a surface to condense on to or conglomerations of liquid water molecules of water to freeze. For these reasons, relative humidities over ice in the atmosphere can be found above 100%, meaning supersaturation has occurred. Supersaturation of water is actually very common in the upper troposphere, occurring between 20% and 40% of the time. This can be determined using satellite data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The title is also cognate to the English \"[[duke]]\", with a different meaning. \nOriginally referring to any military leader, it became in the [[Later Roman Empire|Late Roman Empire]] the title for a leader of an expeditionary force formed by detachments () from the frontier army (), separate from, but subject to, the governor of a province, authorized to conduct operations beyond provincial boundaries.\nThe doge of Venice acted as both the head of state and head of the Venetian [[oligarchy]]. Doges were elected for life through a complex voting process.\nHistory.\nThe office and title of [[Doge (title)|doge]], in relation to [[Byzantine Venetia|Venetia]] (region) and [[Venice]] (city), emerged from older [[duke|ducal]] offices (lat. [[Dux]]) that existed in the late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires.\nByzantine era.\nDuring the second half of the 6th and throughout the 7th century, Byzantine province of [[Byzantine Venetia|Venetia]] was gradually reduced to coastal lagoons, while the hinterland was occupied by the [[Lombards]]. The remaining Byzantine regions along the coast were governed by a \"[[magister militum]]\", subordinated to the imperial [[exarch of Ravenna]]. Thus, in 639, provincial governor of Byzantine Venetia was \"magister militum\" Mauricius, and the same office was in the first half of the 8th century held by Marcellus, as recorded in a later document known as \"[[Pactum Lotharii]]\" (840). Initially, the seat of local administration was situated in [[Oderzo]], and later moved first to [[Eraclea]] ([[Cittanova (Veneto)|Cittanova]]), and then to [[Malamocco]], to be finally settled in [[Rialto]] (lat. \"civitas Rivoalti\", the Venice proper) since the first half of the 9th century.\nThe first historically attested doge was [[Orso Ipato]], who served in the first half of the 8th century, while accounts on his alleged predecessors [[Paolo Lucio Anafesto]] and [[Marcello Tegalliano]] were created by later [[Venice|Venetian]] chronicler [[John the Deacon (Venetian chronicler)|John the Deacon]] at the beginning of the 11th century, and then expanded by later chroniclers. According to modern scholars, those accounts are not considered as reliable.\nIn the latter half of the eighth century, [[Maurizio Galbaio|Mauritius Galba]] was elected doge and took the title , 'master of the soldiers, consul and imperial duke of the province of Venice'. Doge [[Giustiniano Participazio|Justinian Partecipacius]] (d. 829) used the title , 'imperial \"hypatos\" and humble duke of Venice'.\nThese early titles combined [[Byzantine bureaucracy and aristocracy|Byzantine honorifics]] and explicit reference to Venice's subordinate status. Titles like , , , and were granted by the emperor to the recipient for life but were not inherent in the office (, ), but the title belonged to the office (, ). Thus, into the eleventh century the Venetian doges held titles typical of Byzantine rulers in outlying regions, such as [[Byzantine Sardinia|Sardinia]]. As late as 1202, the Doge [[Enrico Dandolo]] was styled , a title granted to him by [[Alexios III Angelos]].\nAs Byzantine power declined in the region in the late ninth century, reference to Venice as a province disappeared in the titulature of the doges. The simple titles (duke of the Venetians) and (duke of the Venetias) predominate in the tenth century. The plural reflects the doge's rule of several federated townships and clans.\nDukes of Dalmatia and Croatia.\nAfter defeating [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and conquering some Dalmatian territory in 1000, Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] adopted the title , 'Duke of Dalmatia', or in its fuller form, , 'Duke of the Venetians and Dalmatians'.\nThis title was recognised by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] in 1002. After a Venetian request, it was confirmed by the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1082. In a [[Byzantine\u2013Venetian Treaty of 1082|chrysobull dated that year]], Alexios granted the Venetian doge the imperial title of , and recognised him as imperial over the [[Dalmatia (theme)|Dalmatian theme]].\nThe expression ('by the grace of God') was adopted consistently by the Venetian chancery only in the course of the eleventh century. An early example, however, can be found in 827\u201329, during the joint reign of Justinian and his brother [[Giovanni I Participazio|John I]]: , 'by divine grace dukes of the Venetian provinces'.\nBetween 1091 and 1102, the [[King of Hungary]] acquired the Croatian kingdom in [[Croatia in union with Hungary|a personal union]]. In these circumstances, the Venetians appealed to the Byzantine emperor for recognition of their title to Croatia (like Dalmatia, a former Byzantine subject). Perhaps as early as the reign of [[Vital Falier]] (d. 1095), and certainly by that of [[Vitale I Michiel|Vital Michiel]] (d. 1102), the title had been added, giving the full dogal title four parts: , 'Duke of Venice, Dalmatia and Croatia and Imperial \"Protosebastos\"'. In the fourteenth century, the doges periodically objected to the use of Dalmatia and Croatia in the Hungarian king's titulature, regardless of their own territorial rights or claims. Later medieval chronicles mistakenly attributed the acquisition of the Croatian title to Doge [[Ordelaf Falier]] (d. 1117).\nAccording to the \"Venetiarum Historia\", written around 1350, Doge [[Domenico Morosini]] added ('and lord of Istria') to his title after forcing [[Pula]] on [[Istria]] to submit in 1150. Only one charter, however, actually uses a title similar to this: (1153).\nPost-1204.\nThe next major change in the dogal title came with the [[Fourth Crusade]], which conquered the Byzantine Empire (1204). The Byzantine honorific had by this time been dropped and was replaced by a reference to Venice's allotment in the [[Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae|partitioning of the Byzantine Empire]]. The new full title was 'By the grace of God duke of the Venices, Dalmatia and Croatia and lord of a fourth part and a half [three eighths] of the whole Empire of Romania' ( [or ] [or ] ).\nAlthough traditionally ascribed by later medieval chroniclers to Doge Enrico Dandolo, who led the Venetians during the Fourth Crusade, and hence known as the \"arma Dandola\", in reality the title of 'lord of a fourth part and a half of the Empire of Romania' was first claimed by the ambitious Venetian [[Podest\u00e0 of Constantinople|\"podest\u00e0\" of Constantinople]], Marino Zeno, in his capacity as the Doge's representative in the 'Empire of Romania', and it was only subsequently adopted as part of the dogal title by Doge [[Pietro Ziani]].\nThe Greek chronicler [[George Akropolites]] used the term to translate , 'lord', which has led to some confusion with the Byzantine court title of [[despot (court title)|despot]]. The latter title was never claimed by the doges, but was sometimes used by the Venetian \"podest\u00e0s\" of Constantinople in their capacity as the doge's representatives.\nThe title of 'lord of a fourth part and a half of the whole Empire of Romania' was used in official titulature thereafter, with the exception, after the [[Reconquest of Constantinople|re-establishment in 1261]] of the [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty]], of Venice's relations with the Byzantine emperors, when that part of the dogal titulature was substituted by 'and lord of the lands and islands subject to his dogate' () or similar formulations.\nIn a similar manner, the disputes between Venice and Hungary over Dalmatia and Croatia led to the kings of Hungary addressing the doges of Venice without that part of their title, while in turn the Venetians tried to force the Hungarian kings to drop any title laying claim to the two provinces.\nThis dispute ended in the [[Treaty of Zadar]] of 1358, where Venice renounced its claims to Dalmatia; a special article in the treaty removed Dalmatia and Croatia from the doge's title. The resulting title was , 'Duke of the Venices and the rest'. Even though Dalmatia would be regained by Venice in the early 15th century, the title was never modified, and remained in use until the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|end of the Republic]]. Even when the body of such documents was written in Italian, the title and dating clause were in Latin.\nSelection of the doge.\n[[file:Pinacoteca Querini Stampalia - Elezione del doge per opera dei Quarantuno - Gabriele Bella.jpg|thumb|\"Election of the Doge by the Forty-One\" \u2013 [[Gabriele Bella]]|227x227px]]\nThe doge's prerogatives were not defined with precision. While the position was entrusted to members of the inner circle of powerful Venetian families, after several doges had associated a son with themselves in the ducal office, this tendency toward a hereditary monarchy was checked by a law that decreed that no doge had the right to associate any member of his family with himself in his office, nor to name his successor.\nAfter 1172 the election of the doge was entrusted to a committee of forty, who were chosen by four men selected from the [[Great Council of Venice]], which was itself nominated annually by twelve persons. After a [[Split vote|deadlocked tie]] at the election of 1229, the number of electors was increased from forty to forty-one.\nNew regulations for the elections of the doge introduced in 1268 remained in force until the end of the republic in 1797. Their intention was to minimize the influence of individual great families, and this was effected by a complex electoral machinery. Thirty members of the Great Council, [[sortition|chosen by lot]], were reduced by lot to nine; the nine chose forty and the forty were reduced by lot to twelve, who chose twenty-five. The twenty-five were reduced by lot to nine, and the nine elected forty-five. These forty-five were once more reduced by lot to eleven, and the eleven finally chose the forty-one who elected the doge.\nElection required at least twenty-five votes out of forty-one, nine votes out of eleven or twelve, or seven votes out of nine electors.\nBefore taking the oath of investiture, the doge-elect was presented to the [[Concio (Venice)|concio]] with the words: \"This is your doge, if it please you.\" This ceremonial gesture signified the assent of the Venetian people. This practice came to an end with the abolition of the concio in 1423; after the election of [[Francesco Foscari]], he was presented with the unconditional pronouncement \u2013 \"Your doge\".\nRegulations.\n[[Image:(Venice) Doge's Palace and campanile of St. Mark's Basilica facing the sea.jpg|thumb|The [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] complex.]]\nWhile doges had great temporal power at first, after 1268, the doge was constantly under strict surveillance: he had to wait for other officials to be present before opening dispatches from foreign powers; he was not allowed to possess any property in a foreign land.\nThe doges normally ruled for life (although a few were forcibly removed from office). After a doge's death, a commission of \"inquisitori\" passed judgment upon his acts, and his estate was liable to be fined for any discovered malfeasance. The official income of the doge was never large, and from early times holders of the office remained engaged in trading ventures. These ventures kept them in touch with the requirements of the \"grandi\".\nFrom 7 July 1268, during a vacancy in the office of doge, the state was headed \"ex officio\", with the style \"vicedoge\", by the senior \"consigliere ducale\" (ducal counsellor).\nRitual role.\n[[Image:Grand Procession of the Doge of Venice.png|thumb|left|Grand Procession of the Doge, 16th century]]\n[[Image:BartolomeoGradonicoGoldCoin.jpg|thumb|Gold coin of [[Bartolomeo Gradenigo]] (1260\u20131342): the Doge kneeling before St. Mark.]]\n[[File:View of St Marks Place Venice Sixteenth Century after Cesare Vecellio.png|thumb|250px|left|View of the Piazzetta in the 16th century, after Cesare Vecellio]]\n[[File:Canaletto - Bucentaur's return to the pier by the Palazzo Ducale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|\"The Return of the [[Bucentaur]] to the Molo on Ascension Day\" (1730 by [[Canaletto]])]]\nOne of the ceremonial duties of the doge was to celebrate the symbolic [[Marriage of the Sea ceremony|marriage of Venice with the sea]]. This was done by casting a ring from the state barge, the \"[[Bucentaur]]\", into the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. In its earlier form this ceremony was instituted to commemorate the conquest of [[Dalmatia]] by Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]] in 1000, and was celebrated on [[Ascension Day]]. It took its later and more magnificent form after the visit to Venice in 1177 of [[Pope Alexander III]] and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]]. On state occasions the doge was surrounded by an increasing amount of ceremony, and in international relations he had the status of a sovereign [[prince]].\nThe doge took part in ducal processions, which started in the [[Piazza San Marco]]. The doge would appear in the center of the procession, preceded by civil servants ranked in ascending order of prestige and followed by noble magistrates ranked in descending order of status. [[Francesco Sansovino]] described such a procession in minute detail in 1581. His description is confirmed and complemented by [[Cesare Vecellio]]'s 1586 painting of a ducal procession in the Piazza San Marco.\nRegalia.\nFrom the 14th century onward, the ceremonial crown and well-known symbol of the doge of Venice was called \"[[corno ducale]]\", a unique ducal hat. It was a stiff horn-like bonnet, which was made of gemmed brocade or cloth-of-gold and worn over the [[camauro]]. This was a fine linen cap with a structured peak reminiscent of the [[Phrygian cap]], a classical symbol of liberty. This ceremonial cap may have been ultimately based on the [[hedjet|white crown of Upper Egypt]]. Every [[Easter Monday]] the doge headed a [[procession]] from [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]] to the [[convent]] of [[San Zaccaria]], where the [[abbess]] presented him a new \"camauro\" crafted by the nuns.\nThe Doge's official costume also included golden robes, slippers and a sceptre for ceremonial duties.\nDeath and burial.\n[[File:Choir of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice) - Monument of doge Leonardo Loredan.jpg|thumb|249x249px|[[Tomb of Doge Leonardo Loredan]] in the [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo]].]]\nUntil the 15th century, the funeral service for a deceased doge would normally be held at [[St Mark's Basilica]], where some early holders of this office are also buried. After the 15th century, however, the funerals of all later doges were held at the [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice|Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo]]. Twenty-five doges are buried there.\nDecline of the office.\nAs the oligarchical element in the constitution developed, the more important functions of the ducal office were assigned to other officials, or to administrative boards. The doge's role became a mostly representative position. The last doge was [[Ludovico Manin]], who abdicated in 1797, when Venice passed under the power of [[Napoleon]]'s France following his conquest of the city.\nWhile Venice would shortly declare itself again as a republic, attempting to resist annexation by Austria, it would never revive the title of doge. It used various titles, including [[dictator]], and collective heads of state to govern the jurisdiction, including a [[triumvirate]].\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt;[[File:Commons-logo.svg|16x16px|class=noviewer sister-inline-image|alt=]] Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\n[[Category:Doges of Venice| ]]\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of Venice]]"}

Welch was gunned down outside his residence by three assailants, in front of his wife and driver. 17N's repeated claims of responsibility were ignored until 25 December 1976, when it subsequently murdered the former Intelligence Chief of the Greek security police, Evangelos Mallios, convicted of torturing political prisoners during the dictatorship, and left \"scattered leaflets\" at the scene claiming responsibility for the 1975 Welch murder. 17N used two M1911 pistols in these killings.\nAfter their first attack against the CIA station chief, the group tried to get mainstream newspapers to publish their manifesto. Their first proclamation, claiming the murder of Richard Welch, was first sent to \"Lib\u00e9ration\" in Paris, France. It was given to the publisher of \"Lib\u00e9ration\" via the offices of Jean-Paul Sartre.\nOne of their demands was the removal of US military bases from Greece. When the Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou renewed the US base agreement, 17N responded to the perceived betrayal by attempting to assassinate US Master Sergeant Robert Judd, firing five rounds at him while his car was stopped in traffic. They issued a communique after the attack: \"American Imperialists, The people do not want you! Take your bases and go!\"\nPolice suspected the group of using a stolen anti-armor rocket to attack a downtown branch of the American Citibank in April 1998. The attack caused damage but no injuries, as the warhead did not explode. The rocket was fired by remote control from a private car parked outside the bank on Drossopoulou Street in the downtown district of Kypseli.\nA British defence attach\u00e9, Brigadier Stephen Saunders, was shot and killed on 8 June 2000 by two men on motorbikes as he drove to work in Kifissia, Athens.\nVictims.\n17N's known murdered (23) and injured victims include:\nTrial.\nThe trial of 19 individuals suspected of involvement with 17N commenced in Athens on 3 March 2003, with Christos Lambrou serving as the lead prosecutor for the Greek state. Because of the 20-year statute of limitations, crimes committed before 1984 (such as the killing of the CIA station chief) could not be tried by the court. On 8 December, fifteen of the accused, including Giotopoulos and Koufontinas, were found guilty; another four defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence. The convicted members were sentenced on 17 December 2003. All those convicted defendants appealed. On 3 May 2007, the convictions were upheld.\nPrison.\nIn early January 2014, Christodoulos Xiros, one of the imprisoned leaders of the organization, escaped from prison. On 6 January, he failed to report to the police after leaving prison under the condition to report to the police every day, which he did six times in 18 months. He was taken into custody while riding a bicycle in the southern suburb of Anavyssos in early January 2015.\nIn 2018 the group's alleged hitman, Dimitris Koufontinas, was moved from Korydallos Prison to a low security agricultural facility after the prison council approved his parole request, citing exemplary behaviour.\n2021 hunger strike.\nOn 8 January 2021, at 63 years of age, Koufontinas entered a hunger strike with the demand of transfer to Korydallos Prison after being sent to a high security prison in Domokos. On 22 February whilst in intensive care at Lamia Hospital Koufontinas started to reject water and medical care, forcibly removing a catheter from his arm before the courts issued an order to force feed the prisoner a few days later, a practice condemned by many, including a Greek union of doctors, as torture. It was reported that on 5 March, Koufontinas had to be resuscitated due to kidney failure. Koufontinas ended his hunger strike on 14 March after 65 days, despite his demands not being met.\nStreet demonstrations were held in multiple cities across Greece as well as attacks against property has been claimed in support of Koufontinas, including a demonstration outside of president Katerina Sakellaropoulou's home and vandalism of buildings belonging to Action 24 TV station and the office of Education Minister Niki Kerameus with paint and projectiles by multiple groups of protesters. Other left-wing activists have shown support for Koufontinas, including Miguel Urb\u00e1n, a co-founder of Podemos, and political filmmaker Costa-Gavras.\nTheories.\nSome Greek officials considered Revolutionary Struggle (EA), the group that fired a Chinese-made RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade at the U.S. Embassy in Athens in January 2007, to be a spin-off of 17N. However, three self-admitted EA members arrested in April 2010 claimed that they were anarchists\u2014a designation 17N rejected in its proclamations. For many years, leading politicians of the right-wing New Democracy party, as well as the conservative press, falsely claimed that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou was the mastermind behind 17N. Virginia Tsouderou, who became Deputy Foreign Minister in the Konstantinos Mitsotakis government, and journalist Georgios Karatzaferis (later the founder and leader of a right-wing party, LAOS) claimed that terrorism in Greece was controlled by Papandreist officers of Hellenic National Intelligence Service (the Greek security and intelligence service), and named Kostas Tsimas (the head of EYP) and Colonel Alexakis as two of the supposed controllers of 17N. However, after 17N members were arrested, the only connection between the terrorist organization and PASOK was that Dimitris Koufontinas was a member of PAMK (\"Panellinia Agonistiki Mathitiki Kinisi\", Panhellenic Militant Pupil's Movement), the PASOK militant high school students organization, and had been an admirer of Andreas Papandreou in his late teens.\nOther writers have also claimed that 17N may have been a tool of foreign secret services. In December 2005, Kleanthis Grivas published an article in \"To Proto Thema\", a Greek Sunday newspaper, in which he accused \"Sheepskin\", the Greek branch of Gladio, NATO's stay-behind paramilitary organization during the Cold War, of the 1975 assassination of Welch as well as of the 2000 assassination of Saunders. This was denied by the US State Department, which responded that \"the Greek terrorist organization '17 November' was responsible for both assassinations\", and asserted that Grivas' central piece of evidence had been the \"Westmoreland Field Manual\", which the State Department as well as a Congressional inquiry, had dismissed as a Soviet forgery. The State Department also highlighted the fact that, in the case of Richard Welch, \"Grivas bizarrely accuses the CIA of playing a role in the assassination of one of its own senior officials\" as well as the Greek government's statements to the effect that the \"stay behind\" network had been dismantled in 1988.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Wodehouse", "text": "English writer (1881\u20131975)\nSir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse ( ; 15 October 1881 \u2013 14 February 1975) was an English writer and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. His creations include the feather-brained Bertie Wooster and his sagacious valet, Jeeves; the immaculate and loquacious Psmith; Lord Emsworth and the Blandings Castle set; the Oldest Member, with stories about golf; and Mr. Mulliner, with tall tales on subjects ranging from bibulous bishops to megalomaniac movie moguls.\nBorn in Guildford, the third son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. His early novels were mostly school stories, but he later switched to comic fiction. Most of Wodehouse's fiction is set in his native United Kingdom, although he spent much of his life in the US and used New York and Hollywood as settings for some of his novels and short stories. He wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies during and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, that played an important part in the development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naive revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.\nIn 1934 Wodehouse moved to France for tax reasons; in 1940 he was taken prisoner at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned for nearly a year. After his release he made five broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death he lived in the US; he took US citizenship in 1955 while retaining his British one. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in Southampton, New York, one month after he was awarded a knighthood of the Order of the British Empire (KBE).\nWodehouse was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He worked extensively on his books, sometimes having two or more in preparation simultaneously. He would take up to two years to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career Wodehouse would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared to comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his fans are former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nWodehouse was born in Guildford, Surrey, the third son of Henry Ernest Wodehouse, a magistrate resident in the British colony of Hong Kong, and his wife, Eleanor, daughter of John Bathurst Deane. The Wodehouses belonged to a cadet branch of the family of the earls of Kimberley. Eleanor Wodehouse was also of ancient aristocratic ancestry. She was visiting her sister in Guildford when Wodehouse was born there prematurely.\nThe boy was baptised at the Church of St Nicolas, Guildford, and was named after his godfather, Pelham von Donop. Wodehouse wrote in 1957, \"If you ask me to tell you frankly if I like the name Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, I must confess that I do not... I was named after a godfather, and not a thing to show for it but a small silver mug which I lost in 1897.\" The first name was rapidly elided to \"Plum\", the name by which Wodehouse became known to family and friends.\nMother and son sailed for Hong Kong, where for his first two years Wodehouse was raised by a Chinese amah (nurse), alongside his elder brothers Philip Peveril John (1877\u20131951) and Ernest Armine (1879\u20131936). When he was two, the brothers were brought to England, where they were placed under the care of an English nanny in a house adjoining that of Eleanor's father and mother.\nThe boys' parents returned to Hong Kong and became virtual strangers to their sons. Such an arrangement was then normal for middle-class families based in the colonies. The lack of parental contact, and the harsh regime of some of those \"in loco parentis\", left permanent emotional scars on many children from similar backgrounds, including the writers Thackeray, Saki, Kipling and Walpole. Wodehouse was more fortunate; his nanny, Emma Roper, was strict but not unkind, and both with her and later at his different schools Wodehouse had a generally happy childhood. His recollection was that \"it went like a breeze from start to finish, with everybody I met understanding me perfectly\". The biographer Robert McCrum suggests that nonetheless Wodehouse's isolation from his parents left a psychological mark, causing him to avoid emotional engagement both in life and in his works. Another biographer, Frances Donaldson, writes, \"Deprived so early, not merely of maternal love, but of home life and even a stable background, Wodehouse consoled himself from the youngest age in an imaginary world of his own.\"\nIn 1886 the brothers were sent to a dame-school in Croydon, where they spent three years. Peveril was then found to have a \"weak chest\"; sea air was prescribed, and the three boys were moved to Elizabeth College on the island of Guernsey. In 1891 Wodehouse went on to Malvern House Preparatory School in Kent, which concentrated on preparing its pupils for entry to the Royal Navy. His father had planned a naval career for him, but the boy's eyesight was found to be too poor for it. He was unimpressed by the school's narrow curriculum and zealous discipline; he later parodied it in his novels, with Bertie Wooster recalling his early years as a pupil at a \"penitentiary... with the outward guise of a prep school\" called Malvern House.\nCheney Court, Ditteridge, a large 17th-century house near Box in Wiltshire, was one of Wodehouse's homes while his parents were living in Hong Kong. His grandmother died in 1892, after which he was largely brought up by his aunts, including the writer Mary Bathurst Deane,\nthe original of Bertie Wooster's fictional Aunt Agatha. In 1955 Wodehouse wrote \"Aunt Agatha is definitely my Aunt Mary, who was the scourge of my childhood.\"\nThroughout their school years the brothers were sent to stay during the holidays with various uncles and aunts from both sides of the family. In the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", Iain Sproat counts twenty aunts and considers that they played an important part not only in Wodehouse's early life, but, thinly disguised, in his mature novels, as the formidable aunts who dominate the action in the Wooster, Blandings, and other stories. The boys had fifteen uncles, four of whom were clergymen. Sproat writes that they inspired Wodehouse's \"pious but fallible curates, vicars, and bishops, of which he wrote with friendly irreverence but without mockery\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHe has the most distorted ideas about wit and humour; he draws over his books and examination papers in the most distressing way and writes foolish rhymes in other people's books. Notwithstanding he has a genuine interest in literature and can often talk with enthusiasm and good sense about it.\n\u2014 Dulwich College report on Wodehouse, 1899.\nAt the age of twelve in 1894, to his great joy, Wodehouse was able to follow his brother Armine to Dulwich College. He was entirely at home there; Donaldson comments that Dulwich gave him, for the first time, \"some continuity and a stable and ordered life\". He loved the camaraderie, distinguished himself at cricket, rugby and boxing, and was a good, if not consistently diligent, student. The headmaster at the time was A. H. Gilkes, a respected classicist, who was a strong influence on Wodehouse. In a study of Wodehouse's works, Richard Usborne argues that \"only a writer who was himself a scholar and had had his face ground into Latin and Greek (especially Thucydides) as a boy\" could sustain the complex sequences of subordinate clauses sometimes found in Wodehouse's comic prose.\nWodehouse's six years at Dulwich were among the happiest of his life: \"To me the years between 1894 and 1900 were like heaven.\" In addition to his sporting achievements he was a good singer and enjoyed taking part in school concerts; his literary leanings found an outlet in editing the school magazine, \"The Alleynian\". For the rest of his life he remained devoted to the school. The biographer Barry Phelps writes that Wodehouse \"loved the college as much as he loved anything or anybody\".\nReluctant banker; budding writer: 1900\u20131908.\nWodehouse expected to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took a turn for the worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, \"The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash\". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a junior position in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for \"Public School Magazine\". In November 1900 his first comic piece, \"Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings\", was accepted by \"Tit-Bits\". A new magazine for boys, \"The Captain\", provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.\nIn 1901, with the help of a former Dulwich master, William Beach Thomas, Wodehouse secured an appointment\u2014at first temporary and later permanent\u2014writing for \"The Globe\"'s popular \"By the Way\" column. He held the post until 1909. At around the same time his first novel was published \u2013 a school story called \"The Pothunters\", serialised incomplete in \"Public School Magazine\" in early 1902, and issued in full in hardback in September. He resigned from the bank that month to devote himself to writing full-time.\nBetween the publication of \"The Pothunters\" 1902 and that of \"Mike\" in 1909, Wodehouse wrote eight novels and co-wrote another two. The critic R. D. B. French writes that, of Wodehouse's work from this period, almost all that deserves to survive is the school fiction. Looking back in the 1950s Wodehouse viewed these as his apprentice years: \"I was practically in swaddling clothes and it is extremely creditable to me that I was able to write at all.\"\nFrom his boyhood Wodehouse had been fascinated by America, which he conceived of as \"a land of romance\"; he \"yearned\" to visit the country, and by 1904 he had earned enough to do so. In April he sailed to New York, which he found greatly to his liking. He noted in his diary: \"In New York gathering experience. Worth many guineas in the future but none for the moment.\" This prediction proved correct: few British writers had first-hand experience of the US, and his articles about life in New York brought him higher than usual fees. He later recalled that \"in 1904 anyone in the London writing world who had been to America was regarded with awe and looked upon as an authority on that \"terra incognita\"... After that trip to New York I was a man who counted... My income rose like a rocketing pheasant.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nThere are pleasant little spots my heart is fixed on,\nDown at Parkhurst or at Portland on the sea,\nAnd some put up at Holloway and Brixton,\nBut Pentonville is good enough for me.&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014 From Wodehouse's first lyric for a stage show, 1904.\nWodehouse's other new venture in 1904 was writing for the stage. Towards the end of the year the librettist Owen Hall invited him to contribute an additional lyric for a musical comedy \"Sergeant Brue\". Wodehouse had loved theatre since his first visit, aged thirteen, when Gilbert and Sullivan's \"Patience\" had made him \"drunk with ecstasy\". His lyric for Hall, \"Put Me in My Little Cell\", was a Gilbertian number for a trio of comic crooks, with music by Frederick Rosse; it was well received and launched Wodehouse on a career as a theatre writer that spanned three decades.\nAlthough it made little impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel \"Love Among the Chickens\" contained what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, is partly based on Wodehouse's \"Globe\" colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, \"Brother Alfred\". Wodehouse would return to the character in short stories over the next six decades.\nIn early 1906 the actor-manager Seymour Hicks invited Wodehouse to become resident lyricist at the Aldwych Theatre, to add topical verses to newly imported or long-running shows. Hicks had already recruited the young Jerome Kern to write the music for such songs. The first Kern-Wodehouse collaboration, a comic number for \"The Beauty of Bath\" titled \"Mr [Joseph] Chamberlain\", was a show-stopper and was briefly the most popular song in London.\nPsmith, Blandings, Wooster and Jeeves: 1908\u20131915.\nWodehouse's early period as a writer came to an end in 1908 with the serialisation of \"The Lost Lambs\", published the following year in book form as the second half of the novel \"Mike\". The work begins as a conventional school story, but Wodehouse introduces a new and strikingly original character, Psmith, whose creation both Evelyn Waugh and George Orwell regarded as a watershed in Wodehouse's development. Wodehouse said that he based Psmith on the hotelier and impresario Rupert D'Oyly Carte\u2014\"the only thing in my literary career which was handed to me on a silver plate with watercress around it\". Wodehouse wrote in the 1970s that a cousin of his who had been at school with Carte told him of the latter's monocle, studied suavity, and stateliness of speech, all of which Wodehouse adopted for his new character. Psmith featured in three more novels: \"Psmith in the City\" (1910), a burlesque of banking; \"Psmith, Journalist\" (1915) set in New York; and \"Leave It to Psmith\" (1923), set at Blandings Castle.\nIn May 1909 Wodehouse made his second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to \"Cosmopolitan\" and \"Collier's\" for a total of $500, a much higher fee than he had commanded previously. He resigned from \"The Globe\" and stayed in New York for nearly a year. He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining \"The Globe\" and also contributing regularly to \"The Strand Magazine\". Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.\nWodehouse was in New York when the war began. Ineligible for military service because of his poor eyesight, he remained in the US throughout the war, detached from the conflict in Europe and absorbed in his theatrical and literary concerns. In September 1914 he married Ethel May Wayman, \"n\u00e9e\" Newton (1885\u20131984), an English widow. The marriage proved happy and lifelong. Ethel's personality was in contrast with her husband's: he was shy and impractical; she was gregarious, decisive and well organised. In Sproat's phrase, she \"took charge of Wodehouse's life and made certain that he had the peace and quiet he needed to write\". There were no children of the marriage, but Wodehouse came to love Ethel's daughter Leonora (1905\u20131944) and legally adopted her.\nWodehouse experimented with different genres of fiction in these years; \"Psmith, Journalist\", mixing comedy with social comment on slum landlords and racketeers, was published in 1915. In the same year \"The Saturday Evening Post\" paid $3,500 to serialise \"Something New\", the first of what became a series of novels set at Blandings Castle. It was published in hardback in the US and the UK in the same year (the British edition being retitled \"Something Fresh\"). It was Wodehouse's first farcical novel; it was also his first best-seller, and although his later books included some gentler, lightly sentimental stories, it was as a farceur that he became known. Later in the same year \"Extricating Young Gussie\", the first story about Bertie and Jeeves, was published. These stories introduced two sets of characters about whom Wodehouse wrote for the rest of his life. The Blandings Castle stories, set in an English stately home, depict the attempts of the placid Lord Emsworth to evade the many distractions around him, which include successive pairs of young lovers, the machinations of his exuberant brother Galahad, the demands of his domineering sisters and super-efficient secretaries, and anything detrimental to his prize sow, the Empress of Blandings. The Bertie and Jeeves stories feature an amiable young man-about-town, regularly rescued from the consequences of his idiocy by the benign interference of his valet.\nBroadway: 1915\u20131919.\nA third milestone in Wodehouse's life came towards the end of 1915: his old songwriting partner Jerome Kern introduced him to the writer Guy Bolton, who became Wodehouse's closest friend and a regular collaborator. Bolton and Kern had a musical, \"Very Good Eddie\", running at the Princess Theatre in New York. The show was successful, but they thought the song lyrics weak and invited Wodehouse to join them on its successor. This was \"Miss Springtime\" (1916), which ran for 227 performances\u2014a good run by the standards of the day. The team produced several more successes, including \"Leave It to Jane\" (1917), \"Oh, Boy!\" (1917\u201318) and \"Oh, Lady! Lady!!\" (1918), and Wodehouse and Bolton wrote a few more shows with other composers. In these musicals Wodehouse's lyrics won high praise from critics as well as fellow lyricists such as Ira Gershwin.\nUnlike his original model, Gilbert, Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first, fitting his words into the melodies. Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years: they fit the music perfectly, but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert's do. Nonetheless, Donaldson adds, the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical. In the \"Grove Dictionary of American Music\" Larry Stempel writes, \"By presenting naturalistic stories and characters and attempting to integrate the songs and lyrics into the action of the libretto, these works brought a new level of intimacy, cohesion, and sophistication to American musical comedy.\" The theatre writer Gerald Bordman calls Wodehouse \"the most observant, literate, and witty lyricist of his day\". The composer Richard Rodgers wrote, \"Before Larry Hart, only P. G. Wodehouse had made any real assault on the intelligence of the song-listening public.\"\n1920s.\nIn the years after the war, Wodehouse steadily increased his sales, polished his existing characters and introduced new ones. Bertie and Jeeves, Lord Emsworth and his circle, and Ukridge appeared in novels and short stories; Psmith made his fourth and last appearance; two new characters were the Oldest Member, narrating his series of golfing stories, and Mr Mulliner, telling his particularly tall tales to fellow patrons of the bar at the Angler's Rest. Various other young men-about-town appeared in short stories about members of the Drones Club.\nThe Wodehouses returned to England, where they had a house in London for some years, but Wodehouse continued to cross the Atlantic frequently, spending substantial periods in New York. He continued to work in the theatre. During the 1920s he collaborated on nine musical comedies produced on Broadway or in the West End, including the long-running \"Sally\" (1920, New York), \"The Cabaret Girl\" (1922, London) and \"Rosalie\" (1928, New York). He also wrote non-musical plays, including \"The Play's the Thing\" (1926), adapted from Ferenc Moln\u00e1r, and \"A Damsel in Distress\" (1928), a dramatisation of his 1919 novel.\nThough never a naturally gregarious man, Wodehouse was more sociable in the 1920s than at other periods. Donaldson lists among those with whom he was on friendly terms writers including A. A. Milne, Ian Hay, Frederick Lonsdale and E. Phillips Oppenheim, and stage performers including George Grossmith Jr., Heather Thatcher and Dorothy Dickson.\nHollywood: 1929\u20131931.\nThere had been films of Wodehouse stories since 1915, when \"A Gentleman of Leisure\" was based on his 1910 novel of the same name. Further screen adaptations of his books were made between then and 1927, but it was not until 1929 that Wodehouse went to Hollywood where Bolton was working as a highly paid writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Ethel was taken with both the financial and social aspects of Hollywood life, and she negotiated a contract with MGM on her husband's behalf under which he would be paid $2,000 a week. This large salary was particularly welcome because the couple had lost considerable sums in the Wall Street crash of 1929.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe actual work is negligible... So far, I have had eight collaborators. The system is that A. gets the original idea, B. comes in to work with him on it, C. makes a scenario, D. does preliminary dialogue, and then they send for me to insert Class and what-not. Then E. and F., scenario writers, alter the plot and off we go again.\n\u2014 Wodehouse on working in Hollywood.\nThe contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, \"It's odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary.\" Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that \"Those Three French Girls\" (1930) was \"as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced.\"\nWodehouse's contract ended after a year and was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave an interview to \"The Los Angeles Times\". Wodehouse was described by Herbert Warren Wind as \"politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly\", and he caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making, and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in \"The New York Times\", and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been \"a storm in a teacup\", and Donaldson comments that, in the straitened post-crash era, the reforms would have been inevitable.\nWind's view of Wodehouse's na\u00efvet\u00e9 is not universally held. Biographers including Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps suggest that his unworldliness was only part of a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire.\nBest-seller: 1930s.\nDuring the 1930s Wodehouse's theatrical work tailed off. He wrote or adapted four plays for the West End; \"Leave it to Psmith\" (1930), which he adapted in collaboration with Ian Hay, was the only one to have a long run. The reviewer in \"The Manchester Guardian\" praised the play, but commented: \"It is Mr Wodehouse's own inimitable narrative comments and descriptions in his own person of the antics of his puppets that one misses. They cannot be got into a play and they are at least half the fun of the novels.\" In 1934 Wodehouse collaborated with Bolton on the book for Cole Porter's \"Anything Goes\" (Porter wrote his own lyrics), but at the last minute their version was almost entirely rewritten by others at the instigation of the producer, who disliked the original script. Concentrating on writing novels and short stories, Wodehouse reached the peak of his productivity in this decade, averaging two books each year, and grossing an annual \u00a3100,000.\nHis practice of dividing his time between Britain and America caused Wodehouse difficulties with the tax authorities of both countries. Both the UK Inland Revenue and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident. The matter was settled after lengthy negotiations, but the Wodehouses decided to change their residential status beyond doubt by moving to France, where they bought a house near Le Touquet in the north.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere is no question that in making Mr P. G. Wodehouse a doctor of letters the University has done the right and popular thing. Everyone knows at least some of his many works and has felt all the better for the gaiety of his wit and the freshness of his style.\n \u2014 \"The Times\" on Wodehouse's honorary doctorate, June 1939\nIn 1935 Wodehouse created the last of his regular cast of principal characters, Lord Ickenham, otherwise known as Uncle Fred, who, in Usborne's words, \"leads the dance in four novels and a short story... a whirring dynamo of misrule\". His other books from the decade include \"Right Ho, Jeeves\", which Donaldson judged his best work, \"Uncle Fred in the Springtime\", which the writer Bernard Levin considered the best, and \"Blandings Castle\", which contains \"Lord Emsworth and the Girl Friend\", which Rudyard Kipling thought \"one of the most perfect short stories I have ever read\".\nOther leading literary figures who admired Wodehouse were A. E. Housman, Max Beerbohm and Hilaire Belloc; on the radio and in print Belloc called Wodehouse \"the best writer of our time: the best living writer of English... the head of my profession\". Wodehouse regarded Belloc's plaudit as \"a gag, to get a rise out of serious-minded authors whom he disliked\". Wodehouse was never sure that his books had literary merit as well as popular appeal, and, Donaldson suggests, must have been overwhelmed when the University of Oxford conferred an honorary doctorate of letters on him in June 1939. His visit to England for the awarding ceremony was the last time he set foot in his native land.\nSecond World War: internment and broadcasts.\nAt the start of the Second World War Wodehouse and his wife remained at their Le Touquet house, where, during the Phoney War, he worked on \"Joy in the Morning\". With the advance of the Germans, the nearby Royal Air Force base withdrew; Wodehouse was offered the sole spare seat in one of the fighter aircraft, but he turned down the opportunity as it would have meant leaving behind Ethel and their dog. On 21 May 1940, with German troops advancing through northern France, the Wodehouses decided to drive to Portugal and fly from there to the US. Two miles from home their car broke down, so they returned and borrowed a car from a neighbour; with the routes blocked with refugees, they returned home again.\nThe Germans occupied Le Touquet on 22 May 1940 and Wodehouse had to report to the authorities daily. After two months of occupation the Germans interned all male enemy nationals under 60, and Wodehouse was sent to a former prison in Loos, a suburb of Lille, on 21 July; Ethel remained in Le Touquet. The internees were placed four to a cell, each of which had been designed for one man. One bed was available per cell, which was made available to the eldest man\u2014not Wodehouse, who slept on the granite floor. The prisoners were not kept long in Loos before they were transported in cattle trucks to a former barracks in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, which was run as a prison by the SS. After a week the men were transferred to Huy in Li\u00e8ge Province, where they were incarcerated in the local citadel. They remained there until September 1940, when they were transported to Tost in Upper Silesia (then Germany, now Toszek in Poland).\nWodehouse's family and friends had not had any news of his location after the fall of France, but an article from an Associated Press reporter who had visited Tost in December 1940 led to pressure on the German authorities to release the novelist. This included a petition from influential people in the US; Senator W.\u00a0Warren Barbour presented it to the German ambassador. Although his captors refused to release him, Wodehouse was provided with a typewriter and, to pass the time, he wrote \"Money in the Bank\". Throughout his time in Tost, he sent postcards to his US literary agent asking for $5 to be sent to various people in Canada, mentioning his name. These were the families of Canadian prisoners of war, and the news from Wodehouse was the first indication that their sons were alive and well. Wodehouse risked severe punishment for the communication, but managed to evade the German censor.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nI never was interested in politics. I'm quite unable to work up any kind of belligerent feeling. Just as I'm about to feel belligerent about some country I meet a decent sort of chap. We go out together and lose any fighting thoughts or feelings.\n\u2014 Wodehouse, in his Berlin broadcasts.\nOn 21 June 1941, while he was in the middle of playing a game of cricket, Wodehouse received a visit from two members of the Gestapo. He was given ten minutes to pack his things before he was taken to the Hotel Adlon, a top luxury hotel in Berlin. He stayed there at his own expense; royalties from the German editions of his books had been put into a special frozen bank account at the outset of the war, and Wodehouse was permitted to draw upon this money he had earned while staying in Berlin. He was thus released from internment a few months before his sixtieth birthday\u2014the age at which civilian internees were released by the Nazis. Shortly afterwards Wodehouse was, in the words of Phelps, \"cleverly trapped\" into making five broadcasts to the US via German radio, with the Berlin-based correspondent of the Columbia Broadcasting System. The broadcasts\u2014aired on 28 June, 9, 23 and 30 July and 6 August\u2014were titled \"How to be an Internee Without Previous Training\", and comprised humorous anecdotes about Wodehouse's experiences as a prisoner, including some gentle mocking of his captors. The German propaganda ministry arranged for the recordings to be broadcast to Britain in August. The day after Wodehouse recorded his final programme, Ethel joined him in Berlin, having sold most of her jewellery to pay for the journey.\nAftermath: reactions and investigation.\nThe reaction in Britain to Wodehouse's broadcasts was hostile, and he was \"reviled\u00a0... as a traitor, collaborator, Nazi propagandist, and a coward\", although, Phelps observes, many of those who decried his actions had not heard the content of the programmes. A front-page article in \"The Daily Mirror\" stated that Wodehouse \"lived luxuriously because Britain laughed with him, but when the laughter was out of his country's heart,\u00a0... [he] was not ready to share her suffering. He hadn't the guts\u00a0... even to stick it out in the internment camp.\" In the House of Commons Anthony Eden, the Foreign Secretary, regretted Wodehouse's actions. Several libraries removed Wodehouse novels from their shelves.\nOn 15 July the journalist William Connor, under his pen name Cassandra, broadcast a postscript to the news programme railing against Wodehouse. According to \"The Times\", the broadcast \"provoked a storm of complaint\u00a0... from listeners all over the country\". Wodehouse's biographer, Joseph Connolly, thinks the broadcast \"inaccurate, spiteful and slanderous\"; Phelps calls it \"probably the most vituperative attack on an individual ever heard on British radio\". The broadcast was made at the direct instruction of Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information, who overruled strong protests made by the BBC against the decision to air the programme. Numerous letters appeared in the British press, both supporting and criticising Wodehouse. The letters page of \"The Daily Telegraph\" became a focus for censuring Wodehouse, including one from Wodehouse's friend, A. A. Milne; a reply from their fellow author Compton Mackenzie in defence of Wodehouse was not published because the editor claimed a lack of space. Most of those defending Wodehouse against accusations of disloyalty, including Sax Rohmer, Dorothy L. Sayers and Gilbert Frankau, conceded that he had acted stupidly. Some members of the public wrote to the newspapers to say that the full facts were not yet known and a fair judgment could not be made until they were. The management of the BBC, who considered Wodehouse's actions no worse than \"ill advised\", pointed out to Cooper that there was no evidence at that point whether Wodehouse had acted voluntarily or under compulsion.\nWhen Wodehouse heard of the furore the broadcasts had caused, he contacted the Foreign Office\u2014through the Swiss embassy in Berlin\u2014to explain his actions, and attempted to return home via neutral countries, but the German authorities refused to let him leave. In \"Performing Flea\", a 1953 collection of letters, Wodehouse wrote, \"Of course I ought to have had the sense to see that it was a loony thing to do to use the German radio for even the most harmless stuff, but I didn't. I suppose prison life saps the intellect.\" The reaction in America was mixed: the left-leaning publication \"PM\" accused Wodehouse of \"play[ing] Jeeves to the Nazis\", but the Department of War used the interviews as an ideal representation of anti-Nazi propaganda.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe broadcasts, in point of fact, are neither anti- nor pro-German, but just Wodehousian. He is a man singularly ill-fitted to live in a time of ideological conflict, having no feelings of hatred about anyone, and no very strong views about anything.\u00a0... I never heard him speak bitterly about anyone\u2014not even about old friends who turned against him in distress. Such temperament does not make for good citizenship in the second half of the Twentieth Century.\n \u2014 Malcolm Muggeridge, discussing Wodehouse's wartime broadcasts from Germany.\nThe Wodehouses remained in Germany until September 1943, when, because of the Allied bombings, they were allowed to move back to Paris. They were living there when the city was liberated on 25 August 1944; Wodehouse reported to the American authorities the following day, asking them to inform the British of his whereabouts. He was subsequently visited by Malcolm Muggeridge, recently arrived in Paris as an intelligence officer with MI6. The young officer quickly came to like Wodehouse and considered the question of treasonable behaviour as \"ludicrous\"; he summed up the writer as \"ill-fitted to live in an age of ideological conflict\". On 9 September Wodehouse was visited by an MI5 officer and former barrister, Major Edward Cussen, who formally investigated him, a process that stretched over four days. On 28 September Cussen filed his report, which states that in regard to the broadcasts, Wodehouse's behaviour \"has been unwise\", but advised against further action. On 23 November Theobald Matthew, the Director of Public Prosecutions, decided there was no evidence to justify prosecuting Wodehouse.\nIn November 1944 Duff Cooper was appointed British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the H\u00f4tel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper complained to the French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. The Wodehouses were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges being presented. When Muggeridge tracked them down later, he managed to get Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained. While in this hospital, Wodehouse worked on his novel \"Uncle Dynamite\".\nWhile still detained by the French, Wodehouse was again mentioned in questions in the House of Commons in December 1944 when MPs wondered if the French authorities could repatriate him to stand trial. Eden stated that the \"matter has been gone into, and, according to the advice given, there are no grounds upon which we could take action\". Two months later, Orwell wrote the essay \"In Defence of P. G. Wodehouse\", where he stated that \"it is important to realise that the events of 1941 do not convict Wodehouse of anything worse than stupidity\". Orwell's rationale was that Wodehouse's \"moral outlook has remained that of a public-school boy, and according to the public-school code, treachery in time of war is the most unforgivable of all the sins\", which was compounded by his \"complete lack\u2014so far as one can judge from his printed works\u2014of political awareness\".\nOn 15 January 1945 the French authorities released Wodehouse, but they did not inform him, until June 1946, that he would not face any official charges and was free to leave the country.\nAmerican exile: 1946\u20131975.\nHaving secured American visas in July 1946, the Wodehouses made preparations to return to New York. They were delayed by Ethel's insistence on acquiring suitable new clothes and by Wodehouse's wish to finish writing the novel \"The Mating Season\" in the peace of the French countryside. In April 1947 they sailed to New York, where Wodehouse was relieved at the friendly reception he received from the large press contingent awaiting his arrival. Ethel secured a comfortable penthouse apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side, but Wodehouse was not at ease. The New York that he had known before the war was much changed. The magazines that had paid lavishly for his stories were in decline, and those that remained were not much interested in him. He was sounded out about writing for Broadway, but he was not at home in the post-war theatre; he had money problems, with large sums temporarily tied up in Britain, and for the first time in his career he had no ideas for a new novel. He did not complete one until 1951.\nWodehouse remained unsettled until he and Ethel left New York City for Long Island. Bolton and his wife lived in the prosperous hamlet of Remsenburg, part of the Southampton area of Long Island, east of Manhattan. Wodehouse stayed with them frequently, and in 1952 he and Ethel bought a house nearby. They lived at Remsenburg for the rest of their lives. Between 1952 and 1975 he published more than twenty novels, as well as two collections of short stories, a heavily edited collection of his letters, a volume of memoirs, and a selection of his magazine articles. He continued to hanker after a revival of his theatrical career. A 1959 off-Broadway revival of the 1917 Bolton-Wodehouse-Kern \"Leave It to Jane\" was a surprise hit, running for 928 performances, but his few post-war stage works, some in collaboration with Bolton, made little impression.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor Mr Wodehouse there has been no fall of Man; no 'aboriginal calamity'. His characters have never tasted the forbidden fruit. They are still in Eden. The gardens of Blandings Castle are that original garden from which we are all exiled.\u00a0... Mr Wodehouse's idyllic world can never stale. He will continue to release future generations from captivity that may be more irksome than our own. He has made a world for us to live in and delight in.\n \u2014 Evelyn Waugh, 1961\nAlthough Ethel made a return visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America after his arrival in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British government indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it actually was in the post-war decades. During their years in Long Island, the couple often took in stray animals and contributed substantial funds to a local animal shelter.\nIn 1955 Wodehouse became an American citizen, though he remained a British subject, and was therefore still eligible for UK state honours. He was considered for the award of a knighthood three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in the January 1975 New Year Honours list. \"The Times\" commented that Wodehouse's honour signalled \"official forgiveness for his wartime indiscretion... It is late, but not too late, to take the sting out of that unhappy incident.\"\nThe following month Wodehouse entered Southampton Hospital, Long Island, for treatment of a skin complaint. While there, he suffered a heart attack and died on 14 February 1975 at the age of 93. He was buried at Remsenburg Presbyterian Church four days later. Ethel outlived him by more than nine years; Leonora had predeceased him, dying suddenly in 1944.\nWriting.\nTechnique and approach.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n When in due course Charon ferries me across the Styx and everyone is telling everyone else what a rotten writer I was, I hope at least one voice will be heard piping up, 'But he did take trouble.'\n\u2014 Wodehouse on Wodehouse, 1957\nBefore starting a book Wodehouse would write up to four hundred pages of notes bringing together an outline of the plot; he acknowledged that \"It's the plots that I find so hard to work out. It takes such a long time to work one out.\" He always completed the plot before working on specific character actions. For a novel the note-writing process could take up to two years, and he would usually have two or more novels in preparation simultaneously. After he had completed his notes, he would draw up a fuller scenario of about thirty thousand words, which ensured plot holes were avoided, and allowed for the dialogue to begin to develop. When interviewed in 1975 he revealed that \"For a humorous novel you've got to have a scenario, and you've got to test it so that you know where the comedy comes in, where the situations come in\u00a0... splitting it up into scenes (you can make a scene of almost anything) and have as little stuff in between as possible.\" He preferred working between 4 and 7\u00a0pm\u2014but never after dinner\u2014and would work seven days a week. In his younger years, he would write around two to three thousand words a day, although he slowed as he aged, so that in his nineties he would produce a thousand. The reduced speed in writing slowed his production of books: when younger he would produce a novel in about three months, while \"Bachelors Anonymous\", published in 1973, took around six months. Although studies of language production in normal healthy ageing show a marked decline from the mid-70s on, a study of Wodehouse's works did not find any evidence of a decline in linguistic ability with age.\nWodehouse believed that one of the factors that made his stories humorous was his view of life, and he stated that \"If you take life fairly easily, then you take a humorous view of things. It's probably because you were born that way.\" He carried this view through into his writing, describing the approach as \"making the thing a sort of musical comedy without music, and ignoring real life altogether\". The literary critic Edward L. Galligan considers Wodehouse's stories to show his mastery in adapting the form of the American musical comedy for his writings. Wodehouse would ensure that his first draft was as carefully and accurately done as possible, correcting and refining the prose as he wrote, and would then make another good copy, before proofreading again and then making a final copy for his publisher.\nMost of Wodehouse's canon is set in an undated period around the 1920s and 1930s. The critic Anthony Lejeune describes the settings of Wodehouse's novels, such as the Drones Club and Blandings Castle, as \"a fairyland\". Although some critics thought Wodehouse's fiction was based on a world that had never existed, Wodehouse affirmed that \"it did. It was going strong between the wars\", although he agreed that his version was to some extent \"a sort of artificial world of my own creation\". The novels showed a largely unchanging world, regardless of when they were written, and only rarely\u2014and mistakenly in McCrum's view\u2014did Wodehouse allow modernity to intrude, as he did in the 1966 story \"Bingo Bans the Bomb\".\nWhen dealing with the dialogue in his novels, Wodehouse would consider the book's characters as if they were actors in a play, ensuring that the main roles were kept suitably employed throughout the storyline, which must be strong: \"If they aren't in interesting situations, characters can't be major characters, not even if you have the rest of the troop talk their heads off about them.\" Many of Wodehouse's parts were stereotypes, and he acknowledged that \"a real character in one of my books sticks out like a sore thumb.\" The publisher Michael Joseph identifies that even within the stereotypes Wodehouse understood human nature, and therefore \"shares with [Charles] Dickens and Charles Chaplin the ability to present the comic resistance of the individual against those superior forces to which we are all subject\".\nMuch of Wodehouse's use of slang terms reflects the influence of his time at school in Dulwich, and partly reflects Edwardian slang. As a young man he enjoyed the literary works of Arthur Conan Doyle and Jerome K. Jerome, and the operatic works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Wodehouse quotes from and alludes to numerous poets throughout his work. The scholar Clarke Olney lists those quoted, including Milton, Byron, Longfellow, Coleridge, Swinburne, Tennyson, Wordsworth and Shakespeare. Another favoured source was the King James Bible.\nLanguage.\nIn 1941 the \"Concise Cambridge History of English Literature\" opined that Wodehouse had \"a gift for highly original aptness of phrase that almost suggests a poet struggling for release among the wild extravagances of farce\", while McCrum thinks that Wodehouse manages to combine \"high farce with the inverted poetry of his mature comic style\", particularly in \"The Code of the Woosters\"; the novelist Anthony Powell believes Wodehouse to be a \"comic poet\". Robert A. Hall Jr., in his study of Wodehouse's style and technique, describes the author as a master of prose, an opinion also shared by Levin, who considers Wodehouse \"one of the finest and purest writers of English prose\". Hall identifies several techniques used by Wodehouse to achieve comic effect, including the creation of new words through adding or removing prefixes and suffixes, so when Pongo Twistleton removes the housemaid Elsie Bean from a cupboard, Wodehouse writes that the character \"de-Beaned the cupboard\". Wodehouse created new words by splitting others in two, thus Wodehouse divides \"hobnobbing\" when he writes: \"To offer a housemaid a cigarette is not hobbing. Nor, when you light it for her, does that constitute nobbing.\"\nRichard Voorhees, Wodehouse's biographer, believes that the author used clich\u00e9s in a deliberate and ironic manner. His opinion is shared by the academic Stephen Medcalf, who deems Wodehouse's skill is to \"bring a clich\u00e9 just enough to life to kill it\", although Pamela March, writing in \"The Christian Science Monitor\", considers Wodehouse to have \"an ability to declich\u00e9 a clich\u00e9\". Medcalf provides an example from \"Right Ho, Jeeves\" in which the teetotal Gussie Fink-Nottle has surreptitiously been given whisky and gin in a punch prior to a prize-giving:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\u2009'It seems to me, Jeeves, that the ceremony may be one fraught with considerable interest.'\n'Yes, sir.'\n'What, in your opinion, will the harvest be?'\n'One finds it difficult to hazard a conjecture, sir.'\n'You mean imagination boggles?'\n'Yes, sir.'\nI inspected my imagination. He was right. It boggled.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe stylistic device most commonly found in Wodehouse's work is his use of comparative imagery that includes similes. Hall opines that the humour comes from Wodehouse's ability to accentuate \"resemblances which at first glance seem highly incongruous\". Examples can be seen in \"Joy in the Morning\", Chapter 29: \"There was a sound in the background like a distant sheep coughing gently on a mountainside. Jeeves sailing into action\", or \"Psmith\", Chapter 7: \"A sound like two or three pigs feeding rather noisily in the middle of a thunderstorm interrupted his meditation.\" Hall also identifies that periodically Wodehouse used the stylistic device of a transferred epithet, with an adjective that properly belongs to a person applied instead to some inanimate object. The form of expression is used sparingly by Wodehouse in comparison with other mechanisms, only once or twice in a story or novel, according to Hall.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on the teaspoon.\"\n\u2014\"Joy in the Morning\", Chapter 5\n\"As I sat in the bath-tub, soaping a meditative foot\u00a0...\"\n\u2014\"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\", Chapter 1\n\"The first thing he did was to prod Jeeves in the lower ribs with an uncouth forefinger.\"\n\u2014\"Much Obliged, Jeeves\", Chapter 4\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWordplay is a key element in Wodehouse's writing. This can take the form of puns, such as in \"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\", when Bertie is released after a night in the police cells, and says that he has \"a pinched look\" about him. Linguistic confusion is another humorous mechanism, such as in \"Uncle Dynamite\" when Constable Potter says he has been \"assaulted by the duck pond\". In reply, Sir Aylmer, confusing the two meanings of the word \"by\", asks: \"How the devil can you be assaulted by a duck pond?\" Wodehouse also uses metaphor and mixed metaphor to add humour. Some come through exaggeration, such as Bingo Little's infant child who \"not only has the aspect of a mass murderer, but that of a mass murderer suffering from an ingrown toenail\", or Wooster's complaint that \"the rumpuses that Bobbie Wickham is already starting may be amusing to her, but not to the unfortunate toads beneath the harrow whom she ruthlessly plunges into the soup.\" Bertie Wooster's half-forgotten vocabulary also provides a further humorous device. In \"Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit\" Bertie asks Jeeves \"Let a plugugly like young Thos loose in the community with a cosh, and you are inviting disaster and\u00a0... what's the word? Something about cats.\" Jeeves replies, \"Cataclysms, sir?\"\nReception and reputation.\nLiterary reception.\nWodehouse's early career as a lyricist and playwright was profitable, and his work with Bolton, according to \"The Guardian\", \"was one of the most successful in the history of musical comedy\". At the outbreak of the Second World War he was earning \u00a340,000 a year from his work, which had broadened to include novels and short stories. Following the furore ensuing from the wartime broadcasts, he suffered a downturn in his popularity and book sales; \"The Saturday Evening Post\" stopped publishing his short stories, a stance they reversed in 1965, although his popularity\u2014and the sales figures\u2014slowly recovered over time.\nWodehouse received great praise from many of his contemporaries, including Max Beerbohm, Rudyard Kipling, A. E. Housman and Evelyn Waugh\u2014the last of whom opines, \"One has to regard a man as a Master who can produce on average three uniquely brilliant and entirely original similes on each page.\" There are dissenters to the praise. The writer Alan Bennett thinks that \"inspired though his language is, I can never take more than ten pages of the novels at a time, their relentless flippancy wearing and tedious\", while the literary critic Q. D. Leavis writes that Wodehouse had a \"stereotyped humour\u00a0... of ingenious variations on a laugh in one place\". In a 2010 study of Wodehouse's few relatively serious novels, such as \"The Coming of Bill\" (1919), \"Jill the Reckless\" (1920) and \"The Adventures of Sally\" (1922), David Heddendorf concludes that though their literary quality does not match that of the farcical novels, they show a range of empathy and interests that in real life\u2014and in his most comic works\u2014the author seemed to lack. \"Never oblivious to grief and despair, he opts in clear-eyed awareness for his timeless world of spats and woolly-headed peers. It's an austere, almost bloodless preference for pristine artifice over the pain and messy outcomes of actual existence, but it's a case of Wodehouse keeping faith with his own unique art.\"\nThe American literary analyst Robert F. Kiernan, defining \"camp\" as \"excessive stylization of whatever kind\", brackets Wodehouse as \"a master of the camp novel\", along with Thomas Love Peacock, Max Beerbohm, Ronald Firbank, E. F. Benson and Ivy Compton-Burnett. The literary critic and writer Cyril Connolly calls Wodehouse a \"politicians' author\"\u2014one who does \"not like art to be exacting and difficult\". Two former British prime ministers, H. H. Asquith and Tony Blair, are on record as Wodehouse aficionados, and the latter became a patron of the Wodehouse Society. Se\u00e1n O'Casey, a successful playwright of the 1920s, thought little of Wodehouse; he commented in 1941 that it was damaging to England's dignity that the public or \"the academic government of Oxford, dead from the chin up\" considered Wodehouse an important figure in English literature. His jibe that Wodehouse was \"English literature's performing flea\" provided his target with the title of his collected letters, published in 1953. McCrum, writing in 2004, observes, \"Wodehouse is more popular today than on the day he died\", and \"his comic vision has an absolutely secure place in the English literary imagination\".\nHonours and influence.\nThe proposed nominations of Wodehouse for a knighthood in 1967 and 1971 were blocked for fear that such an award would \"revive the controversy of his wartime behaviour and give currency to a Bertie Wooster image of the British character which the embassy was doing its best to eradicate\". When Wodehouse was awarded the knighthood, only four years later, the journalist Dennis Barker wrote in \"The Guardian\" that the writer was \"the solitary surviving English literary comic genius\". After his death six weeks later, the journalist Michael Davie, writing in the same paper, observed that \"Many people regarded\u00a0... [Wodehouse] as he regarded Beachcomber, as 'one, if not more than one, of England's greatest men'\", while in the view of the obituarist for \"The Times\" Wodehouse \"was a comic genius recognized in his lifetime as a classic and an old master of farce\". In September 2019 Wodehouse was commemorated with a memorial stone in Westminster Abbey; the dedication was held two days after it was installed.\nSince Wodehouse's death there have been numerous adaptations and dramatisations of his work on television and film; Wodehouse himself has been portrayed on radio and screen numerous times. There are several literary societies dedicated to Wodehouse. The P. G. Wodehouse Society (UK) was founded in 1997 and has over 1,000 members as at 2015. Alexander Armstrong became president of the society in 2017; past presidents have included Terry Wogan and Richard Briers. There are also groups of Wodehouse fans in Australia, Belgium, France, Finland, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden and the US. As at 2015 the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" contains over 1,750 quotations from Wodehouse, illustrating terms from \"crispish\" to \"zippiness\". Voorhees, while acknowledging that Wodehouse's antecedents in literature range from Ben Jonson to Oscar Wilde, writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[I]t is now abundantly clear that Wodehouse is one of the funniest and most productive men who ever wrote in English. He is far from being a mere jokesmith: he is an authentic craftsman, a wit and humorist of the first water, the inventor of a prose style which is a kind of comic poetry.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63348", "revid": "7198019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63348", "title": "Lacrimosa (band)", "text": "Swiss rock band\nLacrimosa is a Swiss gothic metal band led by German musician Tilo Wolff, who is also the main composer, and Finn Anne Nurmi. They are currently based in Switzerland, but originally from Germany. Originally counted among the bands of the Neue Deutsche Todeskunst genre, Lacrimosa are most commonly associated with the gothic metal genre.\nTheir musical style mixes gothic rock and heavy metal, along with violin, trumpet, and more classical instruments, although their musical development throughout the years has led to changes in instrumentation. Lacrimosa's lyrics are written almost exclusively in German, although since the 1995 album \"Inferno,\" every album has featured one or two songs in English. These songs are generally written by Anne Nurmi. Finnish has also appeared in the spoken intro to two songs (\"Schakal\" on \"Inferno\" and \"The Turning Point\" on \"Elodia\") and on a bonus track in a limited edition release of \"Fassade\" called \"Vankina\". Their lyrics are mainly about loneliness, sadness, darkness, despair, and love.\nThe band has sold more than 20,000 copies of each album in Germany, but has also gained a large fanbase in Russia, Mexico and China.\nStyle and themes.\nLacrimosa's first album, \"Angst\", is slow and minimal music, dominated by keyboards and voice. This early period explores fear, helplessness, loneliness, non-existence, unattainability, the illusionary nature of love, and death. The same themes can be found on the next three albums, \"Einsamkeit\", \"Satura\", and \"Inferno\". Musically, this period is characterised by the introduction of electric guitars and basses, with more rock elements being added.\n\"Stille\" was the beginning of their metal style. Heavy guitars and bombastic arrangements for classical instruments dominate the music in the style of symphonic metal. Thematically, \"Stille\" features several uplifting songs. \"Stolzes Herz\" (\"Proud heart\") and \"Die Strasse der Zeit\" (\"The Lane of Time\") praise individual and cultural strength. \"Die Strasse der Zeit\" describes a journey backwards through a history of war, greed, and stupidity, until the protagonist finds solace in ancient Greek culture.\nThe next album, \"Elodia\", reduced the metal-style guitars and increases the symphonic, classical arrangements, this time recorded in part by the London Symphony Orchestra. Presented as a play in three parts, \"Elodia\" revolves around the theme of love. The gothic element is still present and the themes of loss and death feature prominently in the latter half, but it ends with an affirmation of hope.\n\"Fassade\" features a variety of musical visions, from the metal sound of \"Liebesspiel\" (\"Love Game\") to flowing keyboards of \"Senses\", and the symphonic interplay between guitars and orchestra on \"Fassade\". The latter, a piece in three movements arranged on the album as tracks 1, 5, and 8, explores a critique of modern society. It ends with an affirmation of individuality and the protagonist's retreat from society.\nIn \"Echos,\" guitars and other rock elements appear less often, whereas classical instruments feature more prominently. The orchestral arrangements move away from standard symphonic arrangements often found in contemporary metal music, as in the album's first track, \"Kyrie - Overture\". \"Echos\" also shows influence from electronic and industrial music, as in the song \"Ein Hauch von Menschlichkeit\" (\"A Touch of Humanity\"). This album is more personal and quieter than those before it. It continues to explore love with gothic twists.\nLacrimosa's ninth album, \"Lichtgestalt\", retains the classical elements, but rock elements begin to resurface. The first track, \"Sapphire\", begins as a slow, classical song but halfway moves into a metal section; the pace of the song increases, a heavy guitar backing takes over, and Wolff switches from singing into a high-pitched death grunt for a few minutes. The remaining songs display a similar mix of styles to previous albums, with some upbeat songs, a song written and sung in English mainly by Anne Nurmi, and some slower-paced, sadder pieces.\nIn 2005, \"Lichtgestalten\" was released, containing a new electronic version of the song \"Lichtgestalt\", produced by Tilo for his solo project, \"Snakeskin\".\nIn 2006, a DVD called \"Musikkurzfilme\" was released, which contained all the video clips that Lacrimosa shot throughout their career, including the video for \"Lichtgestalt\".\n\"Sehnsucht\" was released in 2009. Wolff wanted to create an album that was less conceptual and more spontaneous than the previous releases, so \"Sehnsucht\" features a variety of musical expressions.\nIn 2008, Lacrimosa's label Hall of Sermon reclaimed the rights to all of the band's Nuclear Blast releases. In March 2008, Lacrimosa started working on their next studio album, entitled \"Sehnsucht\", which was released on 8 May 2009.\nTheir eleventh studio album was released in September 2012, called \"Revolution\". The first song on this release was written in 2009 while they were touring in China.\nIn 2015, \"Hoffnung\" was released, followed in 2017 by \"Testimonium\", which was meant as a commemorative album for recently deceased musicians like David Bowie and Prince. The band's latest album was released on 24 December 2021 with the title \"Leidenschaft\" (\"Passion\").\nMembers.\nPast members\nDiscography.\nAll albums and DVDs were published by Tilo Wolff's own label, Hall of Sermon.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The breakthrough earned him the 1980 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg.\nHe is one of only three people to have won multiple Nobel Prizes in the same category (the others being John Bardeen in physics and Karl Barry Sharpless in chemistry), and one of five persons with .\nEarly life and education.\nFrederick Sanger was born on 13 August 1918 in Rendcomb, a small village in Gloucestershire, England, the second son of Frederick Sanger, a general practitioner, and his wife, Cicely Sanger (n\u00e9e Crewdson). He was one of three children. His brother, Theodore, was only a year older, while his sister May (Mary) was five years younger. His father had worked as an Anglican medical missionary in China but returned to England because of ill health. He was 40 in 1916 when he married Cicely, who was four years younger. Sanger's father converted to Quakerism soon after his two sons were born and brought up the children as Quakers. Sanger's mother was the daughter of an affluent cotton manufacturer and had a Quaker background, but was not a Quaker.\nWhen Sanger was around five years old the family moved to the small village of Tanworth-in-Arden in Warwickshire. The family was reasonably wealthy and employed a governess to teach the children. In 1927, at the age of nine, he was sent to the Downs School, a residential preparatory school run by Quakers near Malvern. His brother Theo was a year ahead of him at the same school. In 1932, at the age of 14, he was sent to the recently established Bryanston School in Dorset. This used the Dalton system and had a more liberal regime which Sanger much preferred. At the school he liked his teachers and particularly enjoyed scientific subjects. Able to complete his School Certificate a year early, for which he was awarded seven credits, Sanger was able to spend most of his last year of school experimenting in the laboratory alongside his chemistry master, Geoffrey Ordish, who had originally studied at Cambridge University and been a researcher in the Cavendish Laboratory. Working with Ordish made a refreshing change from sitting and studying books and awakened Sanger's desire to pursue a scientific career. In 1935, prior to heading off to college, Sanger was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany on an exchange program. The school placed a heavy emphasis on athletics, which caused Sanger to be much further ahead in the course material compared to the other students. He was shocked to learn that each day was started with readings from Hitler's Mein Kampf, followed by a Sieg Heil salute.\nIn 1936 Sanger went to St John's College, Cambridge, to study natural sciences. His father had attended the same college. For Part\u00a0I of his Tripos he took courses in physics, chemistry, biochemistry and mathematics but struggled with physics and mathematics. Many of the other students had studied more mathematics at school. In his second year he replaced physics with physiology. He took three years to obtain his Part\u00a0I. For his Part\u00a0II he studied biochemistry and obtained a 1st Class Honours. Biochemistry was a relatively new department founded by Gowland Hopkins with enthusiastic lecturers who included Malcolm Dixon, Joseph Needham and Ernest Baldwin.\nBoth his parents died from cancer during his first two years at Cambridge. His father was 60 and his mother was 58. As an undergraduate Sanger's beliefs were strongly influenced by his Quaker upbringing. He was a pacifist and a member of the Peace Pledge Union. It was through his involvement with the Cambridge Scientists' Anti-War Group that he met his future wife, Joan Howe, who was studying economics at Newnham College. They courted while he was studying for his Part\u00a0II exams and married after he had graduated in December 1940. Sanger, although brought up and influenced by his religious upbringing, later began to lose sight of his Quaker related ways. He began to see the world through a more scientific lens, and with the growth of his research and scientific development he slowly drifted farther from the faith he grew up with. He had nothing but respect for the religious and states he took two things from it, truth and respect for all life. Under the Military Training Act 1939 he was provisionally registered as a conscientious objector, and again under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939, before being granted unconditional exemption from military service by a tribunal. In the meantime he undertook training in social relief work at the Quaker centre, Spicelands, Devon and served briefly as a hospital orderly.\nSanger began studying for a PhD in October 1940 under N.W. \"Bill\" Pirie. His project was to investigate whether edible protein could be obtained from grass. After little more than a month Pirie left the department and Albert Neuberger became his adviser. Sanger changed his research project to study the metabolism of lysine and a more practical problem concerning the nitrogen of potatoes. His thesis had the title, \"The metabolism of the amino acid lysine in the animal body\". He was examined by Charles Harington and Albert Charles Chibnall and awarded his doctorate in 1943.\nResearch and career.\nSequencing insulin.\nNeuberger moved to the National Institute for Medical Research in London, but Sanger stayed in Cambridge and in 1943 joined the group of Charles Chibnall, a protein chemist who had recently taken up the chair in the Department of Biochemistry. Chibnall had already done some work on the amino acid composition of bovine insulin and suggested that Sanger look at the amino groups in the protein. Insulin could be purchased from the pharmacy chain Boots and was one of the very few proteins that were available in a pure form. Up to this time Sanger had been funding himself. In Chibnall's group he was initially supported by the Medical Research Council and then from 1944 until 1951 by a Beit Memorial Fellowship for Medical Research.\nSanger's first triumph was to determine the complete amino acid sequence of the two polypeptide chains of bovine insulin, A and B, in 1952 and 1951, respectively. Prior to this it was widely assumed that proteins were somewhat amorphous. In determining these sequences, Sanger proved that proteins have a defined chemical composition.\nTo get to this point, Sanger refined a partition chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin to determine the composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the N-terminal amino group at one end of the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called \"fingerprints\". The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.\nBy repeating this type of procedure Sanger was able to determine the sequences of the many peptides generated using different methods for the initial partial hydrolysis. These could then be assembled into the longer sequences to deduce the complete structure of insulin. Finally, because the A and B chains are physiologically inactive without the three linking disulfide bonds (two interchain, one intrachain on A), Sanger and coworkers determined their assignments in 1955. Sanger's principal conclusion was that the two polypeptide chains of the protein insulin had precise amino acid sequences and, by extension, that every protein had a unique sequence. It was this achievement that earned him his first Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1958. This discovery was crucial to the later sequence hypothesis of Francis Crick for developing ideas of how DNA codes for proteins.\nSequencing RNA.\nFrom 1951 Sanger was a member of the external staff of the Medical Research Council and when they opened the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1962, he moved from his laboratories in the Biochemistry Department of the university to the top floor of the new building. He became head of the Protein Chemistry division.\nPrior to his move, Sanger began exploring the possibility of sequencing RNA molecules and began developing methods for separating ribonucleotide fragments generated with specific nucleases. This work he did while trying to refine the sequencing techniques he had developed during his work on insulin.\nThe key challenge in the work was finding a pure piece of RNA to sequence. In the course of the work he discovered in 1964, with Kjeld Marcker, the formylmethionine tRNA which initiates protein synthesis in bacteria. He was beaten in the race to be the first to sequence a tRNA molecule by a group led by Robert Holley from Cornell University, who published the sequence of the 77 ribonucleotides of alanine tRNA from \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" in 1965. By 1967 Sanger's group had determined the nucleotide sequence of the 5S ribosomal RNA from \"Escherichia coli\", a small RNA of 120 nucleotides.\nSequencing DNA.\nSanger then turned to sequencing DNA, which would require an entirely different approach. He looked at different ways of using DNA polymerase I from \"E. coli\" to copy single-stranded DNA. In 1975, together with Alan Coulson, he published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the \"Plus and Minus\" technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement on what had gone before, but was still very laborious. Nevertheless, his group were able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage \u03c6X174. This was the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. To their surprise they discovered that the coding regions of some of the genes overlapped with one another.\nIn 1977 Sanger and colleagues introduced the \"dideoxy\" chain-termination method for sequencing DNA molecules, also known as the \"Sanger method\". This was a major breakthrough and allowed long stretches of DNA to be rapidly and accurately sequenced. It earned him his second Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1980, which he shared with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg. The new method was used by Sanger and colleagues to sequence human mitochondrial DNA (16,569 base pairs) and bacteriophage \u03bb (48,502 base pairs). The dideoxy method was eventually used to sequence the entire human genome.\nPostgraduate students.\nDuring the course of his career Sanger supervised more than ten PhD students, two of whom went on to also win Nobel Prizes. His first graduate student was Rodney Porter who joined the research group in 1947. Porter later shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Gerald Edelman for his work on the chemical structure of antibodies. Elizabeth Blackburn studied for a PhD in Sanger's laboratory between 1971 and 1974. She shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak for her work on telomeres and the action of telomerase.\nSanger's rule.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... anytime you get technical development that's two to threefold or more efficient, accurate, cheaper, a whole range of experiments opens up.\nThis rule should not be confused with Terence Sanger's rule, which is related to Oja's rule.\nAwards and honours.\nAs of 2015[ [update]], Sanger is one of the only two people to have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry twice (the other being Karl Barry Sharpless in 2001 and 2022\")\", and one of only five two-time Nobel laureates: The other four were Marie Curie (Physics, 1903 and Chemistry, 1911), Linus Pauling (Chemistry, 1954 and Peace, 1962), John Bardeen (twice Physics, 1956 and 1972), and Karl Barry Sharpless (twice Chemistry, 2001 and 2022).\nThe Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (formerly the \"Sanger Centre\") is named in his honour.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and family.\nSanger married Margaret Joan Howe (not to be confused with Margaret Sanger, the American pioneer of birth control) in 1940. She died in 2012. They had three children\u2014Robin, born in 1943, Peter born in 1946 and Sally Joan born in 1960. He said that his wife had \"contributed more to his work than anyone else by providing a peaceful and happy home.\"\nLater life.\nSanger retired in 1983, aged 65, to his home, \"Far Leys\", in Swaffham Bulbeck outside Cambridge.\nIn 1992, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council founded the Sanger Centre (now the Sanger Institute), named after him. The institute is on the Wellcome Trust Genome Campus near Hinxton, only a few miles from Sanger's home. He agreed to having the Centre named after him when asked by John Sulston, the founding director, but warned, \"It had better be good.\" It was opened by Sanger in person on 4 October 1993, with a staff of fewer than 50 people, and went on to take a leading role in the sequencing of the human genome. The Institute had about 900 people in 2020 and is one of the world's largest genomic research centres.\nSanger said he found no evidence for a God so he became an agnostic. In an interview published in the \"Times\" newspaper in 2000 Sanger is quoted as saying: \"My father was a committed Quaker and I was brought up as a Quaker, and for them truth is very important. I drifted away from those beliefs \u2013 one is obviously looking for truth, but one needs some evidence for it. Even if I wanted to believe in God I would find it very difficult. I would need to see proof.\"\nHe declined the offer of a knighthood, as he did not wish to be addressed as \"Sir\". He is quoted as saying, \"A knighthood makes you different, doesn't it, and I don't want to be different.\" In 1986 he accepted admission to the Order of Merit, which can have only 24 living members.\nIn 2007 the British Biochemical Society was given a grant by the Wellcome Trust to catalogue and preserve the 35 laboratory notebooks in which Sanger recorded his research from 1944 to 1983. In reporting this matter, \"Science\" noted that Sanger, \"the most self-effacing person you could hope to meet\", was spending his time gardening at his Cambridgeshire home.\nSanger died in his sleep at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge on 19 November 2013. As noted in his obituary, he had described himself as \"just a chap who messed about in a lab\", and \"academically not brilliant\".\nGlobal policy.\nHe was one of the signatories of the agreement to convene a convention for drafting a world constitution. As a result, for the first time in human history, a World Constituent Assembly convened to draft and adopt a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.\nSelected publications.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Renowned for his sermons, addresses and literary works, he is regarded as a brilliant orator and literary stylist of the French language.\nA native of Dijon, Bossuet was educated at a Jesuit school before enrolling in the College of Navarre in Paris, where he studied philosophy and theology. In 1652, he was ordained a priest and became a Doctor of Divinity. He spent the next seven years at Metz, where he honed his skills in oratory and politics, before returning to Paris and establishing his reputation as a great preacher. By the early 1660s, Bossuet was preaching regularly before the court of King Louis XIV at Versailles. He was appointed tutor to the Dauphin in 1670 and elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise a year later. In 1681, he was appointed Bishop of Meaux, a position he held until his death. Bossuet was a strong advocate of political absolutism and the divine right of kings. Later in his life, he was also involved in the controversies over Gallicanism and Quietism, and supported the king's revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which abolished the rights of the Huguenot Protestant minority. Bossuet died in 1704 at the age of 76.\nThe works of Bossuet best known to English speakers are three great orations delivered at the funerals of Queen Henrietta Maria, widow of Charles I of England (1669), of her daughter Henriette, Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans (1670), and of the outstanding military commander Le Grand Cond\u00e9 (1687). He published his \"Discours sur l'histoire universelle\" \"(Discourse on Universal History)\" in 1681.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBossuet was born at Dijon. He came from a family of prosperous Burgundian lawyers \u2013 on both his paternal and maternal sides, his ancestors had held legal posts for at least a century. He was the fifth son born to Beneigne Bossuet, a judge of the \"parlement\" (a provincial high court) at Dijon, and Marguerite Mouchet. His parents decided on a career in the Church for their fifth son, so he was tonsured at age eight.\nThe boy was sent to school at the Coll\u00e8ge des Godrans, a classical school run by the Jesuits of Dijon. When his father was appointed to the \"parlement\" at Metz, Bossuet was left in Dijon under the care of his uncle Claude Bossuet d'Aiseray, a renowned scholar. At the Coll\u00e8ge des Godrans, he gained a reputation for hard work: fellow students nicknamed him \"Bos suetus aratro\", an \"ox accustomed to the plough\". His father's influence at Metz allowed him to obtain for the young Bossuet a canonry in the cathedral of Metz when the boy was just 13 years old.\nIn 1642, Bossuet enrolled in the Coll\u00e8ge de Navarre in Paris to finish his classical studies and to begin the study of philosophy and theology. His mentor there was the college's president, Nicolas Cornet, the theologian whose denunciation of Antoine Arnauld at the Sorbonne in 1649 was a major episode in the Jansenist controversy.\nFor the time being, however, Cornet and Arnaud were still on good terms. In 1643, Arnaud introduced Bossuet to the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, a great centre of aristocratic culture and the original home of the \"Pr\u00e9cieuses\". Bossuet was already showing signs of the oratorical brilliance which served him so well throughout his life. On one celebrated occasion at the H\u00f4tel de Rambouillet, during a dispute about extempore preaching, the 16-year-old Bossuet was called on to deliver an impromptu sermon at 11\u00a0pm. Vincent Voiture famously quipped: \"I never heard anybody preach so early nor so late.\"\nEarly clerical career.\nBossuet became a Master of Arts in 1643. He sustained his first thesis (\"tentativa\") in theology on 25 January 1648, in the presence of the Prince de Cond\u00e9. Later in 1648, he was ordained a subdeacon by S\u00e9bastien Zamet, Bishop of Langres. His ordination as a deacon came in 1649, after which he began to preach his first sermons.\nHe sustained his second thesis (\"sorbonica\") on 9 November 1650. Then, in preparation for the priesthood, he spent the next two years in retirement under the spiritual direction of Saint Vincent de Paul at Saint Lazare in Paris.\nPriest at Metz.\nIn January 1652, Bossuet returned to public life, being named Archdeacon of Sarrebourg. He was ordained a priest on 18 March 1652. A few weeks later, he defended his brilliant doctoral work and became a Doctor of Divinity.\nHe spent the next seven years at Metz, where he now had the office of archdeacon. He was plunged at once into the thick of controversy; nearly half of Metz was Protestant, and Bossuet's first appearance in print was a refutation of the Huguenot pastor Paul Ferry (1655). During the rest of his time at Metz he frequently engaged in religious controversies with Protestants (and, less regularly, with Jews). Reconciling the Protestants with the Catholic Church became his dream, and for this purpose, he began to train himself carefully for the pulpit, an all-important centre of influence in a land where political assemblies were unknown and novels and newspapers scarcely born. His youthful imagination was unbridled, and his ideas ran easily into a kind of paradoxical subtlety, redolent of divinity faculties. Nevertheless, his time at Metz was an important time for developing his pulpit oratory and for allowing him to continue his study of Scripture and the Church Fathers. He also gained political experience through his participation in the local Assembly of the Three Orders.\nIn 1657, in Metz, Bossuet preached before Anne of Austria, mother of Louis XIV. As a result, he received the honorific title of \"Counselor and Preacher to the King\".\nEarly career in Paris.\nIn 1657, St. Vincent de Paul convinced Bossuet to move to Paris and give himself entirely to preaching. (He did not entirely sever his connections with the cathedral of Metz, though: he continued to hold his benefice, and in 1664, when his widowed father was ordained as a priest and became a canon of the Metz cathedral chapter, Bossuet was named chapter's dean.)\nBossuet quickly gained a reputation as a great preacher, and by 1660, he was preaching regularly before the court in the Chapel Royal. In 1662, he preached his famous sermon \"On the Duties of Kings\" to Louis XIV at the Louvre.\nIn Paris, the congregations had no mercy on purely clerical logic or clerical taste; if a preacher wished to catch their ear, he had to manage to address them in terms they would agree to consider sensible and well-bred. Having very stern ideas of the dignity of a priest, Bossuet refused to descend to the usual devices for arousing popular interest.\nThe narrative element in Bossuet's sermons grew shorter with each year. He never drew satirical pictures like his great rival Louis Bourdaloue. He would not write out his discourses in full, much less learn them off by heart: of the two hundred printed in his works, all but a fraction are rough drafts. Ladies such as Mme de S\u00e9vign\u00e9 forsook him when Bourdaloue dawned on the Paris horizon in 1669, though F\u00e9nelon and La Bruy\u00e8re, two much sounder critics, refused to follow their example.\nBossuet possessed the full equipment of the orator: voice, language, flexibility, and strength. He never needed to strain for effect; his genius struck out at a single blow the thought, the feeling, and the word. What he said of Martin Luther applied peculiarly to himself: he could fling his fury into theses and thus unite the dry light of argument with the fire and heat of passion. These qualities reached their highest point in the \"Oraisons fun\u00e8bres\" (\"Funeral Orations\").\nBossuet was always best when at work on a large canvas; besides, here no conscientious scruples intervened to prevent him from giving much time and thought to the artistic side of his subject. The \"Oraison\", as its name betokened, stood midway between the sermon proper and what would nowadays be called a biographical sketch. At least that was what Bossuet made it; for on this field, he stood not merely first, but alone.\n137 of Bossuet's sermons preached in the period from 1659 to 1669 are extant, and it is estimated that he preached more than a hundred more that have since been lost. Apart from state occasions, Bossuet seldom appeared in a Paris pulpit after 1669.\nTutor to the Dauphin, 1670\u20131681.\nA favourite of the court, in 1669 Bossuet was gazetted bishop of Condom in Gascony without being obliged to reside there. He was consecrated bishop on 21 September 1670, but he resigned the see when he was elected to the \"Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\" in 1671.\nOn 18 September 1670 he was appointed tutor to the nine-year-old Dauphin, eldest child of Louis XIV. The choice was scarcely fortunate. Bossuet unbent as far as he could, but his genius was by no means fitted to enter into the feelings of a child; and the dauphin was a choleric, ungainly, sullen boy. Probably no one was happier than the tutor when his charge turned sixteen and was married off to a Bavarian princess. Still, Bossuet's nine years at court were by no means wasted.\nBossuet's tutorial functions involved composing all the necessary books of instruction, including not just handwriting samples, but also manuals of philosophy, history, and religion fit for a future King of France. Among the books written by Bossuet during this period are three classics. First came the \"Trait\u00e9 de la connaissance de Dieu et de soi-m\u00eame\" (\"Treatise on the Knowledge of God and of Oneself\") (1677), then the \"Discours sur l'histoire universelle\" (\"Discourse on Universal History\") (1679, published 1682), and lastly the \"Politique tir\u00e9e de l'\u00c9criture Sainte\" (\"Politics Drawn from Holy Scripture\") (1679, published 1709). The three books fit into each other. The \"Trait\u00e9\" is a general sketch of the nature of God and the nature of man. The \"Discours\" is a history of God's dealings with humanity in the past. The \"Politique\" is a code of rights and duties drawn up in the light thrown by those dealings. Bossuet's conclusions are only drawn from Holy Scripture because he wished to gain the highest possible sanction for the institutions of his country and to hallow the France of Louis XIV by proving its astonishing likeness to the Israel of Solomon. Then, too, the veil of Holy Scripture enabled him to speak out more boldly than court etiquette would have otherwise allowed, to remind the son of Louis XIV that kings have duties as well as rights.\nThe Grand Dauphin had often forgotten these duties, but his son, the Petit Dauphin, would bear them in mind. The tutor's imagination looked forward to a time when France would blossom into Utopia, with a Christian philosopher on the throne. That is what made him so stalwart a champion of authority in all its forms: \"le roi, Jesus-Christ et l'Eglise, Dieu en ces trois noms\" (\"the king, Jesus Christ, and the Church, God in His three names\"), he says in a characteristic letter. The object of his books was to provide authority with a rational basis. Bossuet's worship of authority by no means killed his confidence in reason \u2013 what it did was make him doubt the honesty of those who reasoned otherwise than himself.\nThe whole chain of argument seemed to him so clear and simple. Philosophy proves that God exists and that He shapes and governs the course of human affairs. History shows that this governance is, for the most part, indirect, exercised through certain venerable corporations, as well civil and ecclesiastical, all of which demand implicit obedience as the immediate representatives of God. Thus all revolt, whether civil or religious, is a direct defiance of the Almighty.\nOliver Cromwell becomes a moral monster, and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes was the greatest achievement of the second Constantine. The France of his youth had known the misery of divided counsels and civil war; the France of his adulthood, brought together under an absolute sovereign, had suddenly burgeoned into a splendour comparable only with ancient Rome. Why not, then, strain every nerve to hold innovation at bay and prolong that splendour for all time? Bossuet's own \"Discours sur l'histoire universelle\" might have furnished an answer, for there the fall of many empires is detailed; but then the \"Discours\" was composed with a single purpose in mind.\nTo Bossuet, the establishment of Christianity was the one point of real importance in the whole history of the world. He totally ignores the history of Islam and Asia; on Greece and Rome, he only touched insofar as they formed part of the Praeparatio Evangelica. Yet his \"Discours\" is far more than a theological pamphlet. While Pascal might refer to the rise and fall of empires to Providence or chance or a little grain of sand in the English lord protectors' veins, Bossuet held fast to his principle that God works through secondary causes. It is His will that every great change should have its roots in the ages that went before it. Bossuet, accordingly, made a heroic attempt to grapple with origins and causes, and in this way, his book deserves its place as one of the first of philosophic histories.\nBishop of Meaux, 1681\u20131704.\nWith the period of the Dauphin's formal education ending in 1681, Bossuet was appointed Bishop of Meaux by the King on 2 May 1681, which was approved by Pope Innocent XI on 17 November. But before he could take possession of his see, he was drawn into a violent quarrel between Louis XIV and Pope Innocent XI. Here he found himself in a quandary: to support the Pope meant supporting the Jesuits, and he hated their supposed casuistry and \"d\u00e9votion ais\u00e9e\" almost as much as Pascal; to oppose the Pope was to play into the hands of Louis XIV, who was eager to subject the Church to the will of the State. Therefore, Bossuet attempted to steer a middle course. In 1682, before the General Assembly of the French Clergy, he preached a great sermon on the unity of the Church and made it a magnificent plea for compromise. As Louis XIV insisted on his clergy making an anti-papal declaration, Bossuet got leave to draw it up and made it as moderate as he could, and when the Pope declared it null and void, he set to work on a gigantic \"Defensio Cleri Gallicani\", only published after his death. Throughout this controversy, unlike the court bishops, Bossuet constantly resided in his diocese and took an active interest in its administration.\nEfforts to combat Protestantism.\nThe Gallican storm a little abated, he turned back to a project very near his heart. Ever since the early days at Metz, he had been busy with schemes for uniting the Huguenots to the Catholic Church. In 1668, he converted Turenne; in 1670, he published an \"Exposition de la foi catholique\" (\"Exposition of the Catholic Faith\"), so moderate in tone that adversaries were driven to accuse him of having fraudulently watered down the Catholic dogmas to suit Protestant taste.\nFinally, in 1688, his great \"Histoire des variations des \u00c9glises protestantes\" (\"History of the Variations of the Protestant Churches\"), perhaps the most brilliant of all his works, appeared. Few writers could have made the Justification controversy interesting or even intelligible. His argument is simple enough. Without rules, an organised society cannot hold together, and rules require an authorised interpreter. The Protestant churches had thrown over this interpreter; and Bossuet had small trouble in showing that, the longer they lived, the more they varied on increasingly important points.\nThe Protestant Minister Pierre Jurieu having responded to the \"Histoire des variations\", Bossuet published the \"Avertissements aux protestants sur les lettres du ministre Jurieu contre l'Histoire des variations\" (\"Warnings to Protestants on the Letters of Minister Jurieu against the History of Variations\", 1689\u20131691). In the fifth of these \"Avertissements\" (1690), he denied the thesis of the explicit or implicit contract between the prince and his subjects, which Jurieu supported, and formulated the famous sentence: \"To condemn this state [= slavery], it would not only be condemn the law of nations, where servitude is admitted, as it appears by all the laws; but that would be to condemn the Holy Spirit, who commands slaves, through the mouth of St. Paul, to remain in their state, and does not oblige their masters to free them.\" Flaubert, in his \"Sottisier\", noted that in the 19th century, Catholic theology had varied to the point of expressing ideas on slavery diametrically opposed to those of Bossuet.\nFor the moment, the Protestants were pulverised; but before long, they began to ask whether variation was necessarily so great an evil. Between 1691 and 1701, Bossuet corresponded with Leibniz with a view to reunion, but negotiations broke down precisely at this point. Leibniz thought his countrymen might accept individual Roman doctrines, but he flatly refused to guarantee that they would necessarily believe tomorrow what they believe today. He expressed preference for a church eternally variable and forever moving forwards.\nNext, Protestant writers began to accumulate some alleged proofs of Rome's own variations; and here, they were backed up by Richard Simon, a priest of the Paris Oratory and the father of biblical criticism in France. He accused St Augustine, Bossuet's own special master, of having corrupted the primitive doctrine of grace.\nBossuet set to work on a \"Defense de la tradition\", but Simon calmly went on to raise issues graver still. Under a veil of politely ironic circumlocutions, such as did not deceive the Bishop of Meaux, he claimed his right to interpret the Bible like any other book. Bossuet denounced him again and again; Simon told his friends he would wait until the old fellow was no more. Another Oratorian proved more dangerous still. Simon had endangered miracles by applying to them lay rules of evidence, but Malebranche abrogated miracles altogether. It was blasphemous, he argued, to suppose that the Author of nature would violate the law He had Himself established. Bossuet might scribble \"nova, mira, falsa\" in the margins of his book and urge F\u00e9nelon to attack them; Malebranche politely met his threats by saying that to be refuted by such a pen would do him too much honor. These repeated checks soured Bossuet's temper.\nIn his earlier controversies, he had borne himself with great magnanimity, and the Huguenot ministers he refuted had found him a kindly advocate at court. His approval of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes stopped far short of approving dragonnades within his Diocese of Meaux, but now his patience was waning. A dissertation by one Father Caffaro, an obscure Italian monk, became his excuse for writing certain, violent \"Maximes sur la com\u00e9die\" (1694), wherein he made an attack on the memory of Moli\u00e8re, dead more than twenty years.\nControversy with F\u00e9nelon.\nThree years later, he was battling with Bishop Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon over the love of God. F\u00e9nelon, 24 years his junior, was an old pupil who had suddenly become a rival; like Bossuet, F\u00e9nelon was a bishop who served as a royal tutor.\nThe controversy concerned their different reactions to the opinions of Jeanne Guyon: her ideas were similar to the Quietism of Molinos, which was condemned by Pope Innocent XI in 1687. When Mme de Maintenon began questioning the orthodoxy of Mme Guyon's opinions, an ecclesiastical commission of three members, including Bossuet, was appointed to report on the matter. The commission issued 34 articles known as the \"Articles d'Issy\", which condemned Mme Guyon's ideas very briefly and provided a short treatise on the orthodox, Catholic conception of prayer. F\u00e9nelon, who had been attracted to Mme Guyon's ideas, signed off on the Articles, and Mme Guyon submitted to the judgment.\nBossuet now composed \"Instructions sur les \u00e9tats d'oraison\", a work that explained the \"Articles d'Issy\" in greater depth. F\u00e9nelon refused to endorse this treatise, however, and instead composed his own explanation as to the meaning of the \"Articles d'Issy\", his \"Explication des Maximes des Saints\". He explained his view that the goal of human life should be to have love of God as its perfect object, with neither fear of punishment nor desire for the reward of eternal life having anything to do with this pure love of God. King Louis XIV reproached Bossuet for failing to warn him that his grandsons' tutor had such unorthodox opinions and instructed Bossuet and other bishops to respond to the \"Maximes des Saints\".\nBossuet and F\u00e9nelon thus spent the years 1697\u20131699 battling each other in pamphlets and letters until the Inquisition finally condemned the \"Maximes des Saints\" on 12 March 1699. Pope Innocent XII selected 23 specific passages for condemnation. Bossuet triumphed in the controversy and F\u00e9nelon submitted to Rome's determination of the matter.\nDeath.\nUntil he was over 70 years, Bossuet enjoyed good health, but in 1702 he developed chronic kidney stones. Two years later he was a hopeless invalid, and on 12 April 1704 he died quietly. His funeral oration was given by Charles de la Rue, SJ. He was buried at Meaux Cathedral.\nPreaching.\nBossuet is widely considered to be one of the most influential homilists of all time. He is one of the preachers, along with John Tillotson and Louis Bourdaloue, who began the transition from Baroque to Neoclassical preaching. He preached with a simple eloquence that eschewed the grandiose extravagances of earlier preaching. He focused on ethical rather than doctrinal messages, often drawing from the lives of saints or saintly contemporaries as examples. He preached, for example, on St. Francis de Sales as well as funeral orations on Queen Henrietta Maria of France and Henrietta Anne of England. Bossuet's funeral orations in particular had lasting importance and were translated early into many languages, including English. Such was their power that even Voltaire, normally so antagonistic toward clergy, praised his oratorical excellence.\nWorks.\nAn edition of Bossuet's sermons was edited by Abb\u00e9 Lebarq in 6 Vols. (Paris, 1890, 1896), as the \"\u0152uvres oratoires de Bossuet\". His complete works were edited by Lachat in 31 Vols. (Paris, 1862\u20131864).\n\"Politics Drawn from the Very Words of Holy Scripture\".\nWhen Bossuet was chosen to be the tutor of the Dauphin, oldest child of Louis XIV, he wrote several works for the edification of his pupil, one of which was \"Politics Derived from the Words of Holy Scripture\", a discourse on the principles of royal absolutism. The work was published posthumously in 1709.\nThe work consists of several books which are divided into articles and propositions which lay out the nature, characteristics, duties, and resources of royalty. To justify his propositions, Bossuet quotes liberally from the Bible and various psalms.\nThroughout his essay, Bossuet emphasises the fact that royal authority comes directly from God and that the person of the king is sacred. In the third book, Bossuet asserts that \"God establishes kings as his ministers, and reigns through them over the people.\" He also states that \"the prince must be obeyed on principle, as a matter of religion and of conscience.\" While he declares the absolute authority of rulers, he emphasises the fact that kings must use their power only for the public good and that the king is not above the law \"for if he sins, he destroys the laws by his example.\"\nIn books six and seven, Bossuet describes the duties of the subjects to the prince and the special duties of royalty. For Bossuet, the prince was synonymous with the state, which is why, according to him, the subjects of the prince owe the prince the same duties that they owe their country. He also states that \"only public enemies make a separation between the interest of the prince and the interest of the state.\" As far as the duties of royalty, the primary goal is the preservation of the state. Bossuet describes three ways that this can be achieved: by maintaining a good constitution, making good use of the state's resources, and protecting the state from the dangers and difficulties that threaten it.\nIn books nine and ten, Bossuet outlines the various resources of royalty (arms, wealth, and counsel) and how they should be used. In regards to arms, Bossuet explains that there are just and unjust grounds for war. Unjust causes include ambitious conquest, pillage, and jealousy. As far as wealth is concerned, he then lays out the types of expenditures that a king has and the various sources of wealth for the kingdom. He emphasises that the true wealth of a kingdom is its men and says that it is important to improve the people's lot and that there would be no more poor.\nTrivia.\n\"The Catholic Encyclopedia\" (1913) calls Bossuet the greatest pulpit orator of all time, ranking him even ahead of Augustine and Chrysostom.\nThe exterior of Harvard's Sanders Theater includes busts of the eight greatest orators of all time \u2013 they include a bust of Bossuet alongside such giants of oratory as Demosthenes, Cicero, and Chrysostom.\nA character in \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\", being from Meaux and an orator, is nicknamed Bossuet by his friends.\nBossuet was one of several co-editors on the \"Ad usum Delphini\" book series (commonly known as the Delphin Classics) of the Latin classics.\nBossuet was the uncle of Louis Bossuet.\nBossuet was quoted and mentioned in the song 'Un poison violent, c'est \u00e7a l'amour' by Serge Gainsbourg in Anna (1967 film).\nBossuet has a school named after him.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nAttribution:"}
{"id": "63355", "revid": "46696161", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63355", "title": "Columbidae", "text": "Family of birds\nColumbidae is a bird family consisting of doves and pigeons. It is the only family in the order Columbiformes. These are stout-bodied birds with small heads, relatively short necks and slender bills that in some species feature fleshy ceres. They feed largely on plant matter, feeding on seeds (granivory), fruit (frugivory), and foliage (folivory).\nIn colloquial English, the smaller species tend to be called \"doves\", and the larger ones \"pigeons\", although the distinction is not consistent, and there is no scientific separation between them. Historically, the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation. The bird most commonly referred to as \"pigeon\" is the domestic pigeon, descendant of the wild rock dove, which is a common inhabitant of cities as the feral pigeon.\nColumbidae contains 51 genera divided into 353 species. The family occurs worldwide, often in close proximity to humans, but the greatest diversity is in the Indomalayan and Australasian realms. 118 species (34%) are at risk, and 13 are extinct, with the most famous examples being the dodo, a large, flightless, island bird, and the passenger pigeon, that once flocked in the billions.\nEtymology.\n is a French word that derives from the Latin , for a 'peeping' chick, while \"dove\" is an ultimately Germanic word, possibly referring to the bird's diving flight. The English dialectal word appears to derive from Latin . A group of doves has sometimes been called a \"dule\", taken from the French word ('mourning').\nOrigin and evolution.\nColumbiformes is one of the most diverse non-passerine clades of neoavians, and its origins are in the Cretaceous and the result of a rapid diversification at the end of the K-Pg boundary. Whole genome analyses have found Columbiformes is the sister clade to the clade Pteroclimesites a clade consisting the orders Pterocliformes (sandgrouses) and Mesitornithiformes (mesites). The columbiform-pteroclimesitean clade, or Columbimorphae, monophyly has been supported from several studies.\nTaxonomy and systematics.\nThe name 'Columbidae' for the family was first used by the English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819. However, Illiger in 1811 established an older name for the family group (\"Columbini\") and would actually be the proper authority for Columbidae.\nThe interrelationships of columbids (between subfamilies) and the ergotaxonomy of them has been debated, with many different interpretations of how they should be classified. As many as five to six families, along with many subfamilies and tribes, have been used in the past including the family Raphidae for the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire. A 2024 paper on the systematics and nomenclature of the dodo and the solitaire from Young and colleagues also provided an overview of columbid family-group nomina. They recommended recognizing three subfamilies: Columbinae (New World doves and quail-doves, and columbin doves), Claravinae (American ground-doves), and Raphinae (Old World doves and pigeons including the dodo and solitaire). A 2025 paper on the molecular phylogenetic placement of the Cuban endemic blue-headed quail-dove from Oswald and colleagues found the species to be a sister group to Columbinae, as opposed to being a true columbine or a raphine as previous authors have suggested in the past. These authors recommended that the blue-headed quail-dove should be placed in fourth monotypic subfamily, Starnoenadinae.\nThese taxonomic issues are exacerbated by columbids not being well represented in the fossil record, with no truly primitive forms having been found to date. The genus \"Gerandia\" has been described from Early Miocene deposits in France, but while it was long believed to be a pigeon, it is now considered a sandgrouse. Fragmentary remains of a probably \"ptilinopine\" Early Miocene pigeon were found in the Bannockburn Formation of New Zealand and described as \"Rupephaps\"; \"\"Columbina\" prattae\" from roughly contemporary deposits of Florida is nowadays tentatively separated in \"Arenicolumba\", but its distinction from \"Columbina/Scardafella\" and related genera needs to be more firmly established (e.g. by cladistic analysis). Apart from that, all other fossils belong to extant genera.\nList of genera.\nFossil species of uncertain placement:\nDescription.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nOverall, the anatomy of Columbidae is characterized by short legs, short bills with a fleshy cere, and small heads on large, compact bodies. Like some other birds, the Columbidae have no gall bladders. Some medieval naturalists concluded they have no bile (gall), which in the medieval theory of the four humours explained the allegedly sweet disposition of doves. In fact, however, they do have bile (as Aristotle had earlier realized), which is secreted directly into the gut.\nThe wings of most species are large, and have eleven primary feathers; pigeons have strong wing muscles (wing muscles comprise 31\u201344% of their body weight) and are among the strongest fliers of all birds.\nIn a series of experiments in 1975 by Dr.Mark B. Friedman, using doves, their characteristic head bobbing was shown to be due to their natural desire to keep their vision constant. It was shown yet again in a 1978 experiment by Dr.Barrie J. Frost, in which pigeons were placed on treadmills; it was observed that they did not bob their heads, as their surroundings were constant.\nFeathers.\nColumbidae have unique body feathers, with the shaft being generally broad, strong, and flattened, tapering to a fine point, abruptly. In general, the aftershaft is absent; however, small ones on some tail and wing feathers may be present. Body feathers have very dense, fluffy bases, are attached loosely into the skin, and drop out easily. Possibly serving as a predator avoidance mechanism, large numbers of feathers fall out in the attacker's mouth if the bird is snatched, facilitating the bird's escape. The plumage of the family is variable.\nGranivorous species tend to have dull plumage, with a few exceptions, whereas the frugivorous species have brightly coloured plumage. The genera \"Chalcophaps\", \"Ptilinopus\" and \"Alectroenas\" include some of the most brightly coloured pigeons. Pigeons and doves may be sexually monochromatic or dichromatic. In addition to bright colours, some pigeon species may have crests or other ornamentation.\nFlight.\nMany Columbidae are excellent fliers due to the lift provided by their large wings, which results in low wing loading. They are highly maneuverable in flight and have a low aspect ratio due to the width of their wings, allowing for quick flight launches and ability to escape from predators, but at a high energy cost. A few species are long-distance migrants, with some populations of the European turtle dove migrating in excess of 5,000 km between northern Europe in summer and tropical Africa in winter, and the Oriental turtle dove nearly as far in eastern Asia between eastern Siberia and southern China.\nSize.\nPigeons and doves exhibit considerable variation in size, ranging in length from , and in weight from to above . The largest extant species are the crowned pigeons of New Guinea, which are nearly turkey-sized, with lengths of and weights ranging . One of the largest arboreal species, the Marquesan imperial pigeon with a length of , currently battles extinction. The extinct, flightless dodo is the largest columbid to have ever existed, with a height of about , and a range of suggested weights from , although the higher estimates are thought to be based on overweight birds.\nThe least massive columbids belong to species in the genus \"Columbina\"; the common ground dove (\"Columbina passerina\") and the plain-breasted ground dove (\"Columbina minuta\") which are about the same size as a house sparrow, weighing a little above . The dwarf fruit dove, which may measure as little as long, has a marginally smaller total length than any other species from this family.\nDistribution and habitat.\nPigeons and doves are distributed everywhere on Earth, having adapted to most terrestrial habitats available on the planet, except for the driest areas of the Sahara Desert, Antarctica and its surrounding islands, and the high Arctic. They have colonised most of the world's oceanic islands, reaching eastern Polynesia and the Chatham Islands in the Pacific, Mauritius, the Seychelles and R\u00e9union in the Indian Ocean, and the Azores in the Atlantic Ocean.\nColumbid species may be arboreal, terrestrial, or semi-terrestrial. They inhabit savanna, grassland, shrubland, desert, temperate woodland and forest, tropical rainforests, mangrove forest, and even the barren sands and gravels of atolls.\nSome species have large natural ranges. The eared dove ranges across the entirety of South America from Colombia to Tierra del Fuego, the Eurasian collared dove has a massive (if discontinuous) distribution from Britain across Europe, the Middle East, India, Pakistan and China, and the laughing dove across most of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, and the Middle East.\nWhen including human-mediated introductions, the largest range of any species is that of the rock dove, also known as the common pigeon. This species had a large natural distribution from Britain and Ireland to northern Africa, across Europe, Arabia, Central Asia, India, the Himalayas and up into China and Mongolia. The range of the species increased dramatically upon domestication, as the species went feral in cities around the world. The common pigeon is currently resident across most of North America, and has established itself in cities and urban areas in South America, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. A 2020 study found that the east coast of the United States includes two pigeon genetic megacities, in New York and Boston, and observes that the birds do not mix together.\nAs well as the rock dove, several other species of pigeon have become established outside of their natural range after escaping captivity, and other species have increased their natural ranges due to habitat changes caused by human activity.\nOther species of Columbidae have tiny, restricted distributions, usually seen on small islands, such as the whistling dove, which is endemic to the tiny Kadavu Island in Fiji, the Caroline ground dove, restricted to two islands, Truk and Pohnpei in the Caroline Islands, and the Grenada dove, which is only found on the island of Grenada in the Caribbean.\nSome continental species also have tiny distributions, such as the black-banded fruit dove, which is restricted to a small area of the Arnhem Land of Australia, the Somali pigeon, found only in a tiny area of northern Somalia, and Moreno's ground dove, endemic to the area around Salta and Tucuman in northern Argentina.\nBehaviour.\nFeeding.\nSeeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves, and the family can be loosely divided between seed-eating (granivorous) species, and fruit-and-mast-eating (frugivorous) species, though many species consume both.\nThe granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species are more arboreal, tending to feed in trees. The morphological adaptations used to distinguish between the two groups include granivores tending to having thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi, with the frugivores evolved with thin walls, and the fruit-eating species have short intestines, as opposed to the seed eaters having longer intestines. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.\nIn addition to fruit and seeds, a number of other food items are taken by many species. Some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. One species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. Snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves. Flowers are also taken by some species.\nUrban feral pigeons, descendants of domestic rock doves (\"Columbia livia\"), reside in urban environments, disturbing their natural feeding habits. They depend on human activities and interactions to obtain food, causing them to forage for spilled food or food provided by humans.\nReproduction.\nDoves and pigeons build relatively flimsy nests, often using sticks, other vegetable matter, and other debris, which may be placed on trees, on rocky ledges, or on the ground, depending on species. The female may either build the nest, with material gathered by the male, or the male builds the nest by himself. A few species nest colonially, others nest in aggregation.\nMost lay a clutch of one or (usually) two white eggs at a time which take 11-30 days to hatch (larger species have longer incubation times). Both parents care for the young; unlike most birds, both sexes of doves and pigeons produce \"crop milk\" to feed their young. This fluid is secreted by a sloughing of epithelial cells from the lining of the crop.\nUnfledged baby doves and pigeons are called squabs and are generally able to fly by five weeks old. These fledglings, with their immature squeaking voices, are called squeakers once they are weaned, and leave the nest after 25\u201332 days.\nStatus and conservation.\nWhile many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. Among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 (the conventional date for estimating modern extinctions) are two of the most famous extinct species, the dodo and the passenger pigeon.\nThe passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons. In modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on Earth. Its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, Alexander Wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. The decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. Although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the United States throughout the 19thcentury.\nThe dodo, and its extinction, was more typical of the extinctions of pigeons in general. Like many species that colonise remote islands with few predators, it lost much of its predator avoidance behaviour, along with its ability to fly. The arrival of people, along with a suite of other introduced species such as rats, pigs, and cats, quickly spelled the end for this species and many other island species that have become extinct.\n118 columbid species are at risk (34% of the total), with 48 species NT, 40 VU, 18 EN, 11 CR, and 1 EW. Most of these are tropical and live on islands. All of the species are threatened by introduced predators, habitat loss, hunting, or a combination of these factors. In some cases, they may be extinct in the wild, as is the Socorro dove of Socorro Island, Mexico, last seen in the wild in 1972, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. In some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown (DD); the Negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and may or may not be extinct, and the Polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the Pacific Ocean is unknown.\nVarious conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild (\"ex situ\" conservation), and the translocation of individuals to suitable habitats to create additional populations.\nDomestication.\nThe domestic pigeon (\"Columba livia domestica\") is a descendant of the rock dove (\"Columba livia\") that underwent domestication, with studies suggesting domestication as early as 10 thousand years ago. Domestic pigeons have long been a part of human culture; doves were important symbols of the goddesses Innana, Asherah, and Aphrodite, and revered by the early Christian, Islamic and Jewish religions. Domestication of pigeons led to significant use of homing pigeons for communication, including war pigeons, such as the 32 pigeons who were awarded the Dickin Medal for \"brave service\" to their country, in World War II.\nThe ringneck dove is a smaller species of domestic columbid that was kept as a source of food. As a result of selection for tame individuals who would not escape their cages, they lack a survival instinct and cannot survive release.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A better understanding of the physics of explosions made it possible to use controlled explosions in construction, the best-known example being the construction of the Medeu Mudflow Control Dam outside of Almaty in Kazakhstan.\nIn Siberia.\nMikhail Lavrentyev was one of the main organizers and the first Chairman of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in his time the Academy of Sciences of the USSR) from its founding in 1957 to 1975. The foundation of the Siberia's \"Academic Town\" Akademgorodok (now a district of Novosibirsk) remains his most widely known achievement.\nSix months after the decision to found the Siberian Division of the USSR Academy of Sciences Novosibirsk State University was established. The Decree of the Council of Ministers of the USSR was signed January 9, 1958. From 1959 to 1966 he was a professor at Novosibirsk State University.\nLavrentyev was also a founder of the Institute of Hydrodynamics of the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences which since 1980 has been named after Lavrentyev.\nLavrentyev was awarded the honorary title of Hero of Socialist Labour, a Lenin and 2 Stalin Prizes, and a Lomonosov Gold Medal. He was elected a member of several world-renowned academies, and an honorable citizen of Novosibirsk.\nMikhail A. Lavrentyev's son, also named Mikhail (Mikhail M. Lavrentyev, 1930-2010), also became a mathematician and was a member of the leadership of Akademgorodok.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Among his discoveries were the atmosphere of Venus and the law of conservation of mass in chemical reactions. His spheres of science were natural science, chemistry, physics, mineralogy, history, art, philology, optical devices and others. The founder of modern geology, Lomonosov was also a poet and influenced the formation of the modern Russian literary language.\nEarly life and family.\nLomonosov was born in the village of Mishaninskaya, later renamed Lomonosovo in his honor, in Archangelgorod Governorate, on an island not far from Kholmogory, in the far north of Russia. His father, Vasily Dorofeyevich Lomonosov, was a prosperous peasant fisherman turned ship owner, who amassed a small fortune transporting goods from Arkhangelsk to Pustozyorsk, Solovki, Kola, and Lapland. Lomonosov's mother was Vasily's first wife, a deacon's daughter, Elena Ivanovna Sivkova.\nHe remained at Denisovka until he was ten, when his father decided that he was old enough to participate in his business ventures, and Lomonosov began accompanying Vasily on trading missions.\nLearning was young Lomonosov's passion, not business. The boy's thirst for knowledge was insatiable. Lomonosov had been taught to read as a boy by his neighbor Ivan Shubny, and he spent every spare moment with his books. He continued his studies with the village deacon, S.N. Sabelnikov, but for many years the only books he had access to were religious texts. When he was fourteen, Lomonosov was given copies of Meletius Smotrytsky's \"Modern Church Slavonic\" (a grammar book) and Leonty Magnitsky's \"Arithmetic\". Lomonosov was a Russian Orthodox Christian all his life, but had close encounters with Old Believers schism in early youth and later in life he became a deist.\nIn 1724, his father married for the third and final time. Lomonosov and his stepmother Irina had an acrimonious relationship. Unhappy at home and intent on obtaining a higher education, which Lomonosov could not receive in Mishaninskaya, he was determined to leave the village.\nEducation.\nIn 1730, determined to \"study sciences,\" the 19-year-old Lomonosov walked all the way to Moscow. Shortly after arrival, he was admitted into the Slavic Greek Latin Academy by falsely claiming to be a son of a Kholmogory nobleman. In 1734 that initial falsehood, as well as another lie that he was the son of a priest, nearly got him expelled from the academy, but the investigation ended without severe consequences.\nLomonosov lived on three kopecks a day, eating only black bread and kvass, but he made rapid progress scholastically. It is believed that in 1735, after three years in Moscow he was sent to Kiev to study for short period at the Kiev Academy. He quickly became dissatisfied with the education he was receiving there, and returned to Moscow. In five years Lomonosov completed a twelve-year study course and in 1736, among 12 best graduates, was awarded a scholarship at the St. Petersburg Academy. He plunged into his studies and was rewarded with a four-year grant to study abroad, in Germany, first at the University of Marburg and then in Freiberg.\nEducation abroad.\nThe University of Marburg was among Europe's most important universities in the mid-18th century due to the presence of the philosopher Christian Wolff, a prominent figure of the German Enlightenment. Lomonosov became one of Wolff's students while at Marburg from November 1736 to July 1739. Both philosophically and as a science administrator, this connection would be the most influential of Lomonosov's life. In 1739\u20131740 he studied mineralogy, mining, and metallurgy with Bergrat Henckel in his Freiberg laboratory; there, too, he intensified his studies of German literature.\nLomonosov quickly mastered the German language, and in addition to philosophy, seriously studied chemistry, discovered the works of 17th century Irish theologian and natural philosopher Robert Boyle, and even began writing poetry. He also developed an interest in German literature. He is said to have especially admired G\u00fcnther. His \"Ode on the Taking of Khotin from the Turks,\" composed in 1739 - modelled after G\u00fcnther's poem \"Eugen ist fort. Ihr Musen, nach!\", 1718, celebrating the taking of Belgrade from the Turks - , attracted a great deal of attention in Saint Petersburg. \nContrary to his adoration for Wolff, Lomonosov had fierce disputes with Henckel over the training and education courses he and his two compatriot students were getting in Freiberg, as well as over very limited financial support which Henckel was instructed to provide to the Russians after numerous debts they had accumulated in Marburg. As the result, Lomonosov left Freiberg without permission and wandered for quite a while over Germany and Holland, unsuccessfully trying to obtain permission from Russian envoys to return to the St. Petersburg Academy.\nDuring his residence in Marburg, Lomonosov boarded with Catharina Zilch, a brewer's widow. He fell in love with Catharina's daughter Elisabeth Christine Zilch. They were married in June 1740. Lomonosov found it extremely difficult to maintain his growing family on the scanty and irregular allowance granted him by the Russian Academy of Sciences. As his circumstances became desperate, he got permission to return to Saint Petersburg.\nReturn to Russia.\nLomonosov returned to Russia in June 1741, after being abroad 4 years and 8 months. A year later he was named an Adjunct of the Russian Academy of Science in the physics department. In May 1743, Lomonosov was accused, arrested, and held under house arrest for eight months, after he supposedly insulted various people associated with the academy. He was released and pardoned in January 1744 after apologising to all involved.\nLomonosov was made a full member of the academy and named professor of chemistry in 1745. He established the academy's first chemistry laboratory. Eager to improve Russia's educational system, in 1755, Lomonosov joined his patron Count Ivan Shuvalov in founding Moscow University.\nIn 1760, he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1764, he was elected Foreign Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Institute of Bologna. In 1764, Lomonosov was appointed to the position of the State Councillor which was of Rank V in the Russian Empire's Table of Ranks. He died on 15 April\u00a0[O.S. 4 April]\u00a01765 1765 in Saint Petersburg. He is widely and deservingly regarded as the \"Father of Russian Science,\" though many of his scientific accomplishments were relatively unknown outside Russia until long after his death and gained proper appreciation only in late 19th and, especially, 20th centuries.\nScience and inventions.\nPhysics.\nIn 1756, Lomonosov tried to replicate Robert Boyle's experiment of 1673. He concluded that the commonly accepted phlogiston theory was false. Anticipating the discoveries of Antoine Lavoisier, he wrote in his diary: \"Today I made an experiment in hermetic glass vessels in order to determine whether the mass of metals increases from the action of pure heat. The experiments \u2013 of which I append the record in 13 pages \u2013 demonstrated that the famous Robert Boyle was deluded, for without access of air from outside the mass of the burnt metal remains the same.\"\nThat is the Law of Mass Conservation in chemical reaction, which is well-known today as \"in a chemical reaction, the mass of reactants is equal to the mass of the products.\" Lomonosov, together with Lavoisier, is regarded as the one who discovered the law of mass conservation.\nHe stated that all matter is composed of corpuscles \u2013 molecules that are \"collections\" of elements \u2013 atoms. In his dissertation \"Elements of Mathematical Chemistry\" (1741, unfinished), the scientist gives the following definition: \"An element is a part of a body that does not consist of any other smaller and different bodies ... corpuscle is a collection of elements forming one small mass.\" In a later study (1748), he uses the term \"atom\" instead of \"element\", and \"particula\" (particle) or \"molecule\" instead of \"corpuscle.\"\nHe regarded heat as a form of motion, suggested the wave theory of light, contributed to the formulation of the kinetic theory of gases, and stated the idea of conservation of matter in the following words: \"All changes in nature are such that inasmuch is taken from one object insomuch is added to another. So, if the amount of matter decreases in one place, it increases elsewhere. This universal law of nature embraces laws of motion as well, for an object moving others by its own force in fact imparts to another object the force it loses\" (first articulated in a letter to Leonhard Euler dated 5 July 1748, rephrased and published in Lomonosov's dissertation \"Reflexion on the solidity and fluidity of bodies,\" 1760).\nAstronomy.\nLomonosov was the first to discover and appreciate the atmosphere of Venus during his observation of the transit of Venus of 1761 in a small observatory near his house in St Petersburg. At least in the English-speaking world, this attribution seems to have been owing to comments from the multi-lingual popular astronomy writer Willy Ley (1966), who consulted sources in both Russian and German, and wrote that Lomonosov observed a luminous ring (this was Ley's interpretation and was not indicated in quotes) and inferred from it the existence of an atmosphere \"maybe greater than that of the Earth\" (which was in quotes). Because many modern transit observers have also seen a threadlike arc produced by refraction of sunlight in the atmosphere of Venus when the planet has progressed off the limb of the Sun, it has generally, if rather uncritically, been assumed that this was the same thing that Lomonosov saw. Indeed, the term \"Lomonosov\u2019s arc\" has frequently been used in the literature. \nIn 2012, Pasachoff and Sheehan consulted original sources, and questioned the basis for the claim that Lomonosov observed the thin arc produced by the atmosphere of Venus. A reference to the paper was even picked up by the Russian state-controlled media group RIA Novosti on 31 January 2013, under the headline \"Astronomical Battle in US Over Lomonosov\u2019s discovery.\" An attempt was made by a group of researchers to experimentally reconstruct Lomonosov's observation using antique telescopes during the transit of Venus on 5\u20136 June 2012. One of them, Y. Petrunin, suggested that the telescope Lomonosov actually used was probably a 50\u00a0mm Dollond with a magnifying power of 40x. \nIt was preserved at Pulkova Observatory but destroyed when the Germans bombed the observatory during World War II. Thus, Lomonosov's actual telescope was not available, but other presumably similar instruments were employed on this occasion, and led the researchers to affirm their belief that Lomonosov's telescope would have been adequate to the task of detecting the arc. Thus A. Koukarine, using a 67\u00a0mm Dollond on Mt. Hamilton, where seeing was likely much better than Lomonosov enjoyed at St. Petersburg, clearly observed the spiderweb-thin arc known to be due to refraction in the atmosphere of Venus. However, Koukarine's sketches do not really resemble the diagram published by Lomonosov. \nKoukarine's colleague V. Shiltsev, who more nearly observed under the same conditions as Lomonosov, using a 40\u00a0mm Dollond at Batavia, Illinois, produced a close duplicate of Lomonosov's diagram. However, the rather large wing of light shown next to the black disk of Venus in his drawing (and Lomonosov's) is too coarse to have been the arc. Instead it appears to be a complicated manifestation of the celebrated optical effect known as the \"black drop\". It should be kept in mind that, as stated in Sheehan and Westfall, \"optical distortions at the interface between Venus and the Sun during transits are impressively large, and any inferences from them are fraught with peril\".\nAgain, the actual words used by Lomonosov do not refer to an \"arc\" at all. In the Russian version, he described a brief brightening lasting a second or so, just before third contact, which appeared to Pasachoff and Sheehan to most probably indicate a last fleeting glimpse of the photosphere. As a check against this, Lomonosov's German version (he had learned to speak and write German fluently as a student at Marburg) was also consulted; he describes seeing \"ein ganz helles Licht, wie ein Haar breit\"=\u201da very bright light, as wide as a hair\". Here, the adverb \"ganz\" in connection with \"helles\" (bright) could mean \"as bright as possible\" or \"completely bright\"), i.e., as bright as the surface brightness of the solar disk, which is even stronger evidence that this can't be Venus's atmosphere, which always appears much fainter. \nLomonosov's original sketches, if they existed, do not appear to have survived, Modern observations made during the nineteenth century transits and especially those of 2004 and 2012 suggest that what Lomonosov saw was not the arc associated with the atmosphere of Venus at all but the bright flash of the solar photosphere before third contact. The first observers to record the actual arc associated with the atmosphere of Venus, in a form comporting with modern observations, appear to have been Chappe, Rittenhouse, Wayles and Dymond, and several others at the transit in June 1769.\nIn 1762, Lomonosov presented an improved design of a reflecting telescope to the Russian Academy of Sciences forum. His telescope had its primary mirror adjusted at an angle of four degrees to the telescope's axis. This made the image focus at the side of the telescope tube, where the observer could view the image with an eyepiece without blocking the image. This invention was not published until 1827, so this type of telescope has become associated with a similar design by William Herschel, the Herschelian telescope.\nChemistry and geology.\nIn 1759, with his collaborator, academician Joseph Adam Braun, Lomonosov was the first person to record the freezing of mercury and to carry out initial experiments with it. Believing that nature is subject to regular and continuous evolution, he demonstrated the organic origin of soil, peat, coal, petroleum and amber. In 1745, he published a catalogue of over 3,000 minerals, and in 1760, he explained the formation of icebergs.\nIn 1763, he published \"On The Strata of the Earth\" \u2013 his most significant geological work. This work puts him before James Hutton, who has been traditionally regarded as the founder of modern geology. Lomonosov based his conceptions on the unity of the Earth's processes in time, and necessity to explain the planet's past from present.\nGeography.\nLomonosov's observation of iceberg formation led into his pioneering work in geography. Lomonosov got close to the theory of continental drift, theoretically predicted the existence of Antarctica (he argued that icebergs of the Southern Ocean could be formed only on a dry land covered with ice), and invented sea tools which made writing and calculating directions and distances easier. In 1764, he organized an expedition (led by Admiral Vasili Chichagov) to find the Northeast Passage between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by sailing along the northern coast of Siberia.\nEngineering.\nThe idea of a coaxial rotor originated from Mikhail Lomonosov. In July 1754, he developed a model of a small helicopter with a coaxial rotor and demonstrated it to the Russian Academy of Sciences.\nMosaic.\nLomonosov was proud to restore the ancient art of mosaics. In 1754, in his letter to Leonhard Euler, he wrote that his three years of experiments on the effects of chemistry of minerals on their colour led to his deep involvement in the mosaic art. In 1763, he set up a glass factory that produced the first stained glass mosaics outside of Italy. There were forty mosaics attributed to Lomonosov, with only twenty-four surviving to the present day. Among the best is the portrait of Peter the Great and the \"Battle of Poltava\", measuring .\nGrammarian, poet, historian.\nBesides his scientific activities, Lomonosov also paid considerable attention to literature. Together with his contemporaries Alexander Sumarokov and Vasily Trediakovsky, Lomonosov sought the creation of a system of Russian linguistic conventions, syntax and prosody which would allow the advancement of a native literary tradition on the basis of Western European genres. He laid out his literary theories in his work \"Epistle on the Rules of Russian Versification\" (1739). Lomonosov is considered the founder of accentual-syllabic (or syllabo-tonic) verse in Russian poetry, although statistical analysis suggests the adoption of this system was already in progress when Lomonosov publicized his theories. His \"Ode on the Taking of Khotin\" has been called the first \"aesthetically indisputable example\" of accentual-syllabic verse in the history of Russian literature. The iambic tetrameter and hexameter verse and the ten-line odic stanza which he developed had a lasting role in Russian poetry. His advocacy of the iamb won out over Trediakovsky's arguments for the trochee as the basic metrical foot.\nLomonosov wrote solemn occasional, spiritual, as natural-philosophical odes, as well as an Anacreontic ode. According to A. Kahn, \"the turgidity of the Lomonosovian ode derives from a propensity to create semantic clusters, usually through etymologic play or tropes, such as zeugma.\" His \"Evening Meditation on God's Grandeur\" and \"Morning Meditation on God's Grandeur\" are the first Russian poems on the theme of sublime admiration of nature. He applied an idiosyncratic theory to his later poems \u2013 tender subjects needed words containing the front vowel sounds E, I, Y and U, whereas things that may cause fear (like \"anger\", \"envy\", \"pain\" and \"sorrow\") needed words with back vowel sounds O, U and Y. That was a version of what is now called sound symbolism. He also wrote two verse tragedies, \"Tamira i Selim\" and \"Demofont\". \nLomonosov wrote an important Russian grammar in 1755 (published in 1757), in which he distinguished Old Church Slavonic and colloquial Russian forms. His work on rhetoric \"Kratkoye rukovodstvo k krasnorechiyu\" (Brief guide to eloquence, 1748) is the first such work in Russian and expounds a theory of literature on the basis of Russian literary models. His treatise \"Predisloviye o polze knig tserkovnykh v rossiyskom yazyke\" (Introduction to the usefulness of church books in the Russian language, 1757) is the first Russian work on stylistics. Lomonosov adopted classical views on the existence of three distinct styles\u2014high, middle, and low\u2014and applied them to the Russian literary language. It also addresses the problems of the combination of Church Slavonic and Russian forms and the categorization of literary genres. In 1760, Lomonosov published a history of Russia. In addition, he attempted to write a grand \"Aeneid\"-inspired epic about Peter the Great, but he died before he could finish it.\nLegacy.\nHis granddaughter Sophia Konstantinova (1769\u20131844) married Russian military hero and statesman General Nikolay Raevsky. His great-granddaughter was Princess Maria (Raevskaya) Volkonskaya, the wife of the Decembrist Prince Sergei Volkonsky.\nThe city of Lomonosov, Russia (formerly Oranienbaum), and a lunar crater bear his name, as do a crater on Mars and the asteroid 1379 Lomonosowa. A Russian satellite launched in 2016 was named Mikhailo Lomonosov after him. The Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg was renamed after him from 1925 to 2005. In 1948, the underwater Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean was named in his honor.\nLomonosov Bridge in Saint Petersburg was named after the polymath. Originally called Tchernyshov Bridge (Chernyshev Bridge) in honour of Count Grigory Tchernyshov (Chernyshev) one of Peter the Great's most prominent generals, whose estates were located nearby, the bridge was erected in 1785\u22121987, and replaced a wooden bridge which had previously stood at the site. It was one of seven moveable stone bridges of similar design crossing the Fontanka River, built simultaneously with the river's granite embankments. Only Lomonosov Bridge and Staro-Kalinkin Bridge have survived more or less intact.\nMoscow's Domodedovo Airport is officially named after Lomonosov.\nThe Lomonosov Gold Medal was established in 1959 and is awarded annually by the Russian Academy of Sciences to a Russian and a foreign scientist.\nLomonosovskaya Station on the Nevsko-Vasileostrovskaya Line of the Saint Petersburg Metro is named after him. It was opened in 1970.\nThe street \"Lomonosova iela\" in the Maskavas For\u0161tate district of Riga is named in honor of Lomonosov. During the Soviet era, a main street in Tallinn, Estonia, was named in his honor as \"M. Lomonossovi\", but from 1991, the year when Estonia restored its independence, the street was renamed Gonsiori after Jakob Johann Gonsior, a 19th-century alderman and lawyer.\nIn Dnipro, Ukraine, a statue of Lomonosov replaced a statue of Catherine the Great in 1919. It stood until 6 January 2023, when it was removed by the city of Dnipro because of Russia's full-scale invasion into Ukraine.\nOn 19 November 2011, Google celebrated his 300th birthday with a Google Doodle.\nA great number of different stamps was issued in honor of Lomonosov throughout the years: Mikhail Lomonosov and the Academy of Sciences building in Leningrad stamp of 1925, stamps depicting Lomonosov issued in 1949, in 1956 and in 1961, a 275th Birth Anniversary of M.V. Lomonosov stamp of 1986, a History of Russia (Ekaterina II) stamp depicting Lomonosov and his study room talking to the queen that was issued in 2004, three 300th Anniversary of the Birth of M.V. Lomonosov stamps were issued in 2011.\nThe \"Akademik Lomonosov\", the first of a series of Russian floating nuclear power stations, is named after him. It started operation on 19 December 2019.\nMoscow State University, founded by him in 1755, was renamed \"M. V. Lomonosov Moscow State University \" in 1940, while celebrating its 185th anniversary. There are also Moscow Institute of Mechanics and Electrical Engineering M.V. Lomonosov (Lomonosov Institute), Lomonosov Institute of Geochemistry, Mineralogy and Petrography, USSR Academy of Sciences in Moscow, Lomonosov Northern (Arctic) Federal University, Odessa Technological Institute of Food Industry n.a. M.V. Lomonosov, Moscow State University of Fine Chemical Technologies n.a. M.V. Lomonosov, and several other schools in Russia and Kazakhstan.\nOn 19 November 1986, on the 275th anniversary of the birth of M.V. Lomonosov, the USSR State Bank issued a 1 ruble commemorative coin from a copper-nickel alloy.\nOn 6 December 2022, the City Council of the Ukrainian city Dnipro decided to remove from the city all monuments to figures of Russian culture and history, in particular it was mentioned that the monuments to Lomonosov, Alexander Pushkin and Maxim Gorky would be removed from the public space of the city.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His most famous works include the early satires \"Decline and Fall\" (1928) and \"A Handful of Dust\" (1934), the novel \"Brideshead Revisited\" (1945), and the Second World War trilogy \"Sword of Honour\" (1952\u20131961). He is recognised as one of the great prose stylists of the English language in the 20th century.\nWaugh, the son of a publisher, was educated at Lancing College and then at Hertford College, Oxford. He worked briefly as a schoolmaster before he became a full-time writer. As a young man, he acquired many fashionable and aristocratic friends and developed a taste for country house society.\nHe travelled extensively in the 1930s, often as a special newspaper correspondent; he reported from Abyssinia at the time of the 1935 Italian invasion. Waugh served in the British armed forces throughout the Second World War, first in the Royal Marines and then in the Royal Horse Guards. He was a perceptive writer who used the experiences and the wide range of people whom he encountered in his works of fiction, generally to humorous effect. Waugh's detachment was such that he fictionalised his own mental breakdown which occurred in the early 1950s.\nWaugh converted to Catholicism in 1930 after his first marriage failed. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially the introduction of the vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for the welfare state culture of the postwar world, and the decline of his health all darkened his final years, but he continued to write. He displayed to the world a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial \"Brideshead Revisited\" (1981).\nFamily background.\nArthur Evelyn St. John Waugh was born on 28 October 1903 to Arthur Waugh and Catherine Charlotte Raban. Distinguished relatives included Lord Cockburn, a leading Scottish advocate and judge, William Morgan, a pioneer of actuarial science and Philip Henry Gosse, a natural scientist who became notorious through his depiction as a religious fanatic in his son Edmund's memoir \"Father and Son\". Among ancestors bearing the Waugh name, Alexander Waugh was a minister in the Secession Church of Scotland who helped found the London Missionary Society and was one of the leading Nonconformist preachers of his day. His grandson Alexander Waugh was a country medical practitioner, who bullied his wife and children and became known in the Waugh family as \"the Brute\". The elder of Alexander's two sons, born in 1866, was Evelyn's father, Arthur Waugh.\nAfter attending Sherborne School and New College, Oxford, Arthur Waugh began a career in publishing and as a literary critic. In 1902 he became managing director of Chapman and Hall, publishers of the works of Charles Dickens. He had married Catherine Raban in 1893; their first son Alexander Raban Waugh (always known as Alec) was born on 8 July 1898. Alec Waugh later became a novelist of note. At the time of his birth the family were living in North London, at Hillfield Road, West Hampstead where, on 28 October 1903, the couple's second son was born, \"in great haste before Dr Andrews could arrive\", Catherine recorded. On 7 January 1904 the boy was christened Arthur Evelyn St John Waugh but was known in the family and in the wider world as Evelyn.\nChildhood.\nGolders Green and Heath Mount.\nIn 1907, the Waugh family left Hillfield Road for Underhill, a house that Arthur had built in North End Road, Hampstead, close to Golders Green, then a semi-rural area of dairy farms, market gardens and bluebell woods. Evelyn received his first school lessons at home, from his mother, with whom he formed a particularly close relationship; his father, Arthur Waugh, was a more distant figure, whose close bond with his elder son, Alec, was such that Evelyn often felt excluded. In September 1910, Evelyn began as a day pupil at Heath Mount preparatory school. By then, he was a lively boy of many interests, who already had written and completed \"The Curse of the Horse Race\", his first story. A positive influence on his writing was a schoolmaster, Aubrey Ensor. Waugh spent six relatively contented years at Heath Mount; on his own assertion he was \"quite a clever little boy\" who was seldom distressed or overawed by his lessons. Physically pugnacious, Evelyn was inclined to bully weaker boys; among his victims was the future society photographer Cecil Beaton, who never forgot the experience.\nOutside school, he and other neighbourhood children performed plays, usually written by Waugh. On the basis of the xenophobia fostered by the genre books of invasion literature, that the Germans were about to invade Britain, Waugh organised his friends into the \"Pistol Troop\", who built a fort, went on manoeuvres and paraded in makeshift uniforms. In 1914, after the First World War began, Waugh and other boys from the Boy Scout Troop of Heath Mount School were sometimes employed as messengers at the War Office; Evelyn loitered about the War Office in hope of glimpsing Lord Kitchener, but never did.\nFamily holidays usually were spent with the Waugh aunts at Midsomer Norton in Somerset, in a house lit with oil lamps, a time that Waugh recalled with delight, many years later. At Midsomer Norton, Evelyn became deeply interested in high Anglican church rituals, the initial stirrings of the spiritual dimension that later dominated his perspective of life, and he served as an altar boy at the local Anglican church. During his last year at Heath Mount, Waugh established and edited \"The Cynic\" school magazine.\nLancing.\nLike his father before him, Alec Waugh went to school at Sherborne. It was presumed by the family that Evelyn would follow, but in 1915, the school asked Evelyn's elder brother Alec to leave after a homosexual relationship came to light. Alec departed Sherborne for military training as an officer, and, while awaiting confirmation of his commission, wrote \"The Loom of Youth\" (1917), a novel of school life, which alluded to homosexual friendships at a school that was recognisably Sherborne. The public sensation caused by Alec's novel so offended the school that it became impossible for Evelyn to go there. In May 1917, much to his annoyance, he was sent to Lancing College, in his opinion a decidedly inferior school.\nWaugh soon overcame his initial aversion to Lancing, settled in and established his reputation as an aesthete. In November 1917 his essay \"In Defence of Cubism\" (1917) was accepted by and published in the arts magazine \"Drawing and Design\"; it was his first published article. Within the school, he became mildly subversive, mocking the school's cadet corps and founding the Corpse Club \"for those who were bored stiff\". The end of the war saw the return to the school of younger masters such as J. F. Roxburgh, who encouraged Waugh to write and predicted a great future for him. Another mentor, Francis Crease, taught Waugh the arts of calligraphy and decorative design; some of the boy's work was good enough to be used by Chapman and Hall on book jackets.\nIn his later years at Lancing, Waugh achieved success as a house captain, editor of the school magazine and president of the debating society, and won numerous art and literature prizes. He also shed most of his religious beliefs. He started a novel of school life, untitled, but abandoned the effort after writing around 5,000 words. He ended his schooldays by winning a scholarship to read Modern History at Hertford College, Oxford, and left Lancing in December 1921.\nOxford.\nWaugh arrived in Oxford in January 1922. He was soon writing to old friends at Lancing about the pleasures of his new life; he informed Tom Driberg: \"I do no work here and never go to Chapel\". During his first two terms, he generally followed convention; he smoked a pipe, bought a bicycle, and gave his maiden speech at the Oxford Union, opposing the motion that \"This House would welcome Prohibition\". Waugh wrote reports on Union debates for both Oxford magazines, \"Cherwell\" and \"Isis\", and he acted as a film critic for \"Isis\". He also became secretary of the Hertford College debating society, \"an onerous but not honorific post\", he told Driberg. Although Waugh tended to regard his scholarship as a reward for past efforts rather than a stepping-stone to future academic success, he did sufficient work in his first two terms to pass his \"History Previous\", an essential preliminary examination.\nThe arrival in Oxford in October 1922 of the sophisticated Etonians Harold Acton and Brian Howard changed Waugh's Oxford life. Acton and Howard rapidly became the centre of an avant-garde circle known as the Hypocrites' Club (Waugh was the secretary of the club), whose artistic, social and homosexual values Waugh adopted enthusiastically; he later wrote: \"It was the stamping ground of half my Oxford life\". He began drinking heavily, and embarked on the first of several homosexual relationships, the most lasting of which were with Hugh Lygon, Richard Pares and Alastair Graham (potentially the inspiration for the fictional character Lord Sebastian Flyte in the novel \"Brideshead Revisited\", though this is rather disputed and was most likely a blend of numerous individuals including Stephen Tennant).\nHe continued to write reviews and short stories for the university journals, and developed a reputation as a talented graphic artist, but formal study largely ceased. This neglect led to a bitter feud between Waugh and his history tutor, C. R. M. F. Cruttwell, dean (and later principal) of Hertford College. When Cruttwell advised him to mend his ways, Waugh responded in a manner which, he admitted later, was \"fatuously haughty\"; from then on, relations between the two descended into mutual hatred. Waugh continued the feud long after his Oxford days by using Cruttwell's name in his early novels for a succession of ludicrous, ignominious or odious minor characters.\nWaugh's dissipated lifestyle continued into his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that year to a Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: \"I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell you some of the things that have happened\". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921\u201322 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for a final term, so he left without a degree.\nBack at home, Waugh began a novel, \"The Temple at Thatch\", and worked with some of his fellow Hypocrites on a film, \"The Scarlet Woman\", which was shot partly in the gardens at Underhill. He spent much of the rest of the summer in the company of Alastair Graham; after Graham departed for Kenya, Waugh enrolled for the autumn at a London art school, Heatherley's.\nEarly career.\nTeaching and writing.\nWaugh began at Heatherley's in late September 1924, but became bored with the routine and quickly abandoned his course. He spent weeks partying in London and Oxford before the overriding need for money led him to apply through an agency for a teaching job. Almost at once, he secured a post at Arnold House, a boys' preparatory school in North Wales, beginning in January 1925, and staying at Plas Dulas nearby. He took with him the notes for his novel, \"The Temple at Thatch\", intending to work on it in his spare time. Despite the gloomy ambience of the school, Waugh did his best to fulfil the requirements of his position, but a brief return to London and Oxford during the Easter holiday only exacerbated his sense of isolation.\nIn the summer of 1925, Waugh's outlook briefly improved, with the prospect of a job in Pisa, Italy, as secretary to the Scottish writer C. K. Scott Moncrieff, who was engaged on the English translations of Marcel Proust's works. Believing that the job was his, Waugh resigned his position at Arnold House. He had meantime sent the early chapters of his novel to Acton for assessment and criticism. Acton's reply was so coolly dismissive that Waugh immediately burnt his manuscript; shortly afterwards, before he left North Wales, he learned that the Moncrieff job had fallen through. The twin blows were sufficient for him to consider suicide. He records that he went down to a nearby beach and, leaving a note with his clothes, walked out to sea. An attack by jellyfish changed his mind, and he returned quickly to the shore.\nDuring the following two years Waugh taught at schools in Aston Clinton in Buckinghamshire (from which he was dismissed for the attempted drunken seduction of a school matron) and Notting Hill in London. He considered alternative careers in printing or cabinet-making, and attended evening classes in carpentry at Holborn Polytechnic while continuing to write. A short story, \"The Balance\", written in an experimental modernist style, became his first commercially published fiction, when it was included by Chapman and Hall in a 1926 anthology, \"Georgian Stories\". An extended essay on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was printed privately by Alastair Graham, using by agreement the press of the Shakespeare Head Press in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he was undergoing training as a printer. This led to a contract from the publishers Duckworths for a full-length biography of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, which Waugh wrote during 1927. He also began working on a comic novel; after several temporary working titles this became \"Decline and Fall\". Having given up teaching, he had no regular employment except for a short, unsuccessful stint as a reporter on the \"Daily Express\" in April\u2013May 1927. That year he met (possibly through his brother Alec) and fell in love with Evelyn Gardner, the daughter of Lord and Lady Burghclere.\n\"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\".\nIn December 1927, Waugh and Evelyn Gardner became engaged, despite the opposition of Lady Burghclere, who felt that Waugh lacked moral fibre and kept unsuitable company. Among their friends, they quickly became known as \"He-Evelyn\" and \"She-Evelyn\". Waugh was at this time dependent on a \u00a34-a-week allowance () from his father and the small sums he could earn from book reviewing and journalism. The Rossetti biography was published to a generally favourable reception in April 1928: J. C. Squire in \"The Observer\" praised the book's elegance and wit; Acton gave cautious approval; and the novelist Rebecca West wrote to express how much she had enjoyed the book. Less pleasing to Waugh were the \"Times Literary Supplement\"'s references to him as \"Miss Waugh\".\nWhen \"Decline and Fall\" was completed, Duckworths objected to its \"obscenity\", but Chapman &amp; Hall agreed to publish it. This was sufficient for Waugh and Gardner to bring forward their wedding plans. They were married in St Paul's Church, Portman Square, on 27 June 1928, with only Acton, Robert Byron, Alec Waugh and the bride's friend Pansy Pakenham present. The couple made their home in a small flat in Canonbury Square, Islington. The first months of the marriage were overshadowed by a lack of money, and by Gardner's poor health, which persisted into the autumn.\nIn September 1928, \"Decline and Fall\" was published to almost unanimous praise. By December, the book was into its third printing, and the American publishing rights were sold for $500. In the afterglow of his success, Waugh was commissioned to write travel articles in return for a free Mediterranean cruise, which he and Gardner began in February 1929, as an extended, delayed honeymoon. The trip was disrupted when Gardner contracted pneumonia and was carried ashore to the British hospital in Port Said. The couple returned home in June, after her recovery. A month later, without warning, Gardner confessed that their mutual friend, John Heygate, had become her lover. After an attempted reconciliation failed, a shocked and dismayed Waugh filed for divorce on 3 September 1929. The couple apparently met again only once, during the process for the annulment of their marriage a few years later.\nNovelist and journalist.\nRecognition.\nWaugh's first biographer, Christopher Sykes, records that after the divorce friends \"saw, or believed they saw, a new hardness and bitterness\" in Waugh's outlook. Nevertheless, despite a letter to Acton in which he wrote that he \"did not know it was possible to be so miserable and live\", he soon resumed his professional and social life. He finished his second novel, \"Vile Bodies\", and wrote articles including (ironically, he thought) one for the \"Daily Mail\" on the meaning of the marriage ceremony. During this period Waugh began the practice of staying at the various houses of his friends; he was to have no settled home for the next eight years.\n\"Vile Bodies\", a satire on the Bright Young People of the 1920s, was published on 19 January 1930 and was Waugh's first major commercial success. Despite its quasi-biblical title, the book is dark, bitter, \"a manifesto of disillusionment\", according to biographer Martin Stannard. As a best-selling author Waugh could now command larger fees for his journalism. Amid regular work for \"The Graphic\", \"Town and Country\" and \"Harper's Bazaar\", he quickly wrote \"Labels\", a detached account of his honeymoon cruise with She-Evelyn.\nConversion to Catholicism.\nOn 29 September 1930, Waugh was received into the Catholic Church. This shocked his family and surprised some of his friends, but he had contemplated the step for some time. He had lost his Anglicanism at Lancing and had led an irreligious life at Oxford, but there are references in his diaries from the mid-1920s to religious discussion and regular churchgoing. On 22 December 1925, Waugh wrote: \"Claud and I took Audrey to supper and sat up until 7 in the morning arguing about the Roman Church\". The entry for 20 February 1927 includes, \"I am to visit a Father Underhill about being a parson\". Throughout the period, Waugh was influenced by his friend Olivia Plunket-Greene, who had converted in 1925 and of whom Waugh later wrote, \"She bullied me into the Church\". It was she who led him to Father Martin D'Arcy, a Jesuit, who persuaded Waugh \"on firm intellectual convictions but little emotion\" that \"the Christian revelation was genuine\". In 1949, Waugh explained that his conversion followed his realisation that life was \"unintelligible and unendurable without God\".\nWriter and traveller.\nOn 10 October 1930, Waugh, representing several newspapers, departed for Abyssinia to cover the coronation of Haile Selassie. He reported the event as \"an elaborate propaganda effort\" to convince the world that Abyssinia was a civilised nation which concealed the fact that the emperor had achieved power through barbarous means. A subsequent journey through the British East Africa colonies and the Belgian Congo formed the basis of two books; the travelogue \"Remote People\" (1931) and the comic novel \"Black Mischief\" (1932). Waugh's next extended trip, in the winter of 1932\u20131933, was to British Guiana (now Guyana) in South America, possibly taken to distract him from a long and unrequited passion for the socialite Teresa Jungman. On arrival in Georgetown, Waugh arranged a river trip by steam launch into the interior. He travelled on via several staging-posts to Boa Vista in Brazil, and then took a convoluted overland journey back to Georgetown. His various adventures and encounters found their way into two further books: his travel account \"Ninety-two Days\", and the novel \"A Handful of Dust\", both published in 1934.\nBack from South America, Waugh faced accusations of obscenity and blasphemy from the Catholic journal \"The Tablet\", which objected to passages in \"Black Mischief\". He defended himself in an open letter to the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Francis Bourne, which remained unpublished until 1980. In the summer of 1934, he went on an expedition to Spitsbergen in the Arctic, an experience he did not enjoy and of which he made minimal literary use. On his return, determined to write a major Catholic biography, he selected the Jesuit martyr Edmund Campion as his subject. The book, published in 1935, caused controversy by its forthright pro-Catholic, anti-Protestant stance but brought its writer the Hawthornden Prize. He returned to Abyssinia in August 1935 to report the opening stages of the Second Italo-Abyssinian War for the \"Daily Mail\". Waugh, on the basis of his earlier visit, considered Abyssinia \"a savage place which Mussolini was doing well to tame\" according to his fellow reporter, William Deedes. Waugh saw little action and was not wholly serious in his role as a war correspondent. Deedes remarks on the older writer's snobbery: \"None of us quite measured up to the company he liked to keep back at home\". However, in the face of imminent Italian air attacks, Deedes found Waugh's courage \"deeply reassuring\". Waugh wrote up his Abyssinian experiences in a book, \"Waugh in Abyssinia\" (1936), which Rose Macaulay dismissed as a \"fascist tract\", on account of its pro-Italian tone. A better-known account is his novel \"Scoop\" (1938), in which the protagonist, William Boot, is loosely based on Deedes.\nAmong Waugh's growing circle of friends were Diana Guinness and Bryan Guinness (dedicatees of \"Vile Bodies\"), Lady Diana Cooper and her husband Duff Cooper, Nancy Mitford who was originally a friend of Evelyn Gardner's, and the Lygon sisters. Waugh had known Hugh Patrick Lygon at Oxford; now he was introduced to the girls and their country house, Madresfield Court, which became the closest that he had to a home during his years of wandering. In 1933, on a Greek islands cruise, he was introduced by Father D'Arcy to Gabriel Herbert, eldest daughter of the late explorer Aubrey Herbert. When the cruise ended Waugh was invited to stay at the Herbert family's villa in Portofino, where he first met Gabriel's 17-year-old sister, Laura.\nSecond marriage.\nOn his conversion, Waugh had accepted that he would be unable to remarry while Evelyn Gardner was alive. However, he wanted a wife and children, and in October 1933, he began proceedings for the annulment of the marriage on the grounds of \"lack of real consent\". The case was heard by an ecclesiastical tribunal in London, but a delay in the submission of the papers to Rome meant that the annulment was not granted until 4 July 1936. In the meantime, following their initial encounter in Portofino, Waugh had fallen in love with Laura Herbert. He proposed marriage, by letter, in spring 1936. There were initial misgivings from the Herberts, an aristocratic Catholic family; as a further complication, Laura Herbert was a cousin of Evelyn Gardner. Despite some family hostility the marriage took place on 17 April 1937 at the Church of the Assumption in Warwick Street, London.\nAs a wedding present the bride's grandmother bought the couple Piers Court, a country house near Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire. The couple had seven children, one of whom died in infancy. Their first child, a daughter, Maria Teresa, was born on 9 March 1938 and a son, Auberon Alexander, on 17 November 1939. Between these events, \"Scoop\" was published in May 1938 to wide critical acclaim. In August 1938 Waugh, with Laura, made a three-month trip to Mexico after which he wrote \"Robbery Under Law\", based on his experiences there. In the book he spelled out clearly his conservative credo; he later described the book as dealing \"little with travel and much with political questions\".\nSecond World War.\nRoyal Marine and commando.\nWaugh left Piers Court on 1 September 1939, at the outbreak of the Second World War and moved his young family to Pixton Park in Somerset, the Herbert family's country seat, while he sought military employment. He also began writing a novel in a new style, using first-person narration, but abandoned work on it when he was commissioned into the Royal Marines in December and entered training at Chatham naval base. He never completed the novel: fragments were eventually published as \"Work Suspended and Other Stories\" (1943).\nWaugh's daily training routine left him with \"so stiff a spine that he found it painful even to pick up a pen\". In April 1940, he was temporarily promoted to captain and given command of a company of marines, but he proved an unpopular officer, being haughty and curt with his men. Even after the German invasion of the Low Countries (10 May \u2013 22 June 1940), his battalion was not called into action. Waugh's inability to adapt to regimental life meant that he soon lost his command, and he became the battalion's Intelligence Officer. In that role, he finally saw action in Operation Menace as part of the British force sent to the Battle of Dakar in West Africa (23\u201325 September 1940) in August 1940 to support an attempt by the Free French Forces to overthrow the Vichy French colonial government and install General Charles de Gaulle. Operation Menace failed, hampered by fog and misinformation about the extent of the town's defences, and the British forces withdrew on 26 September. Waugh's comment on the affair was this: \"Bloodshed has been avoided at the cost of honour.\"\nIn November 1940, Waugh was posted to a commando unit, and, after further training, became a member of \"Layforce\", under Colonel (later Brigadier) Robert Laycock. In February 1941, the unit sailed to the Mediterranean, where it participated in an unsuccessful attempt to recapture Bardia, on the Libyan coast. In May, Layforce was required to assist in the evacuation of Crete: Waugh was shocked by the disorder and its loss of discipline and, as he saw it, the cowardice of the departing troops. In July, during the roundabout journey home by troop ship, he wrote \"Put Out More Flags\" (1942), a novel of the war's early months in which he returned to the literary style he had used in the 1930s. Back in Britain, more training and waiting followed until, in May 1942, he was transferred to the Royal Horse Guards, on Laycock's recommendation. On 10 June 1942, Laura gave birth to Margaret, the couple's fourth child.\nFrustration, \"Brideshead\" and Yugoslavia.\nWaugh's elation at his transfer soon descended into disillusion as he failed to find opportunities for active service. The death of his father, on 26 June 1943, and the need to deal with family affairs prevented him from departing with his brigade for North Africa as part of Operation Husky (9 July \u2013 17 August 1943), the Allied invasion of Sicily. Despite his undoubted courage, his unmilitary and insubordinate character were rendering him effectively unemployable as a soldier. After spells of idleness at the regimental depot in Windsor, Waugh began parachute training at Tatton Park, Cheshire, but landed awkwardly during an exercise and fractured a fibula. Recovering at Windsor, he applied for three months' unpaid leave to write the novel that had been forming in his mind. His request was granted and, on 31 January 1944, he departed for Chagford, Devon, where he could work in seclusion. The result was \"Brideshead Revisited: The Sacred &amp; Profane Memories of Captain Charles Ryder\" (1945), the first of his explicitly Catholic novels of which the biographer Douglas Lane Patey commented that it was \"the book that seemed to confirm his new sense of his writerly vocation\".\nWaugh managed to extend his leave until June 1944. Soon after his return to duty he was recruited by Randolph Churchill to serve in the Maclean Mission to Yugoslavia, and, early in July, flew with Churchill from Bari, Italy, to the Croatian island of Vis. There, they met Marshal Tito, the Communist leader of the Partisans, who was leading the guerrilla fight against the occupying Axis forces with Allied support. Waugh and Churchill returned to Bari before flying back to Yugoslavia to begin their mission, but their aeroplane crash-landed, both men were injured, and their mission was delayed for a month.\nThe mission eventually arrived at Topusko, where it established itself in a deserted farmhouse. The group's liaison duties, between the British Army and the Communist Partisans, were light. Waugh had little sympathy with the Communist-led Partisans and despised Tito. His chief interest became the welfare of the Catholic Church in Croatia, which, he believed, had suffered at the hands of the Serbian Orthodox Church and would fare worse when the Communists took control. He expressed those thoughts in a long report, \"Church and State in Liberated Croatia\". After spells in Dubrovnik and Rome, Waugh returned to London on 15 March 1945 to present his report, which the Foreign Office suppressed to maintain good relations with Tito, now the leader of communist Yugoslavia.\nPostwar.\nFame and fortune.\n\"Brideshead Revisited\" was published in London in May 1945. Waugh had been convinced of the book's qualities, \"my first novel rather than my last\". It was a tremendous success, bringing its author fame, fortune and literary status. Happy though he was with this outcome, Waugh's principal concern as the war ended was the fate of the large populations of Eastern European Catholics, betrayed (as he saw it) into the hands of Stalin's Soviet Union by the Allies. He now saw little difference in morality between the war's combatants and later described it as \"a sweaty tug-of-war between teams of indistinguishable louts\". Although he took momentary pleasure from the defeat of Winston Churchill and his Conservatives in the 1945 general election, he saw the accession to power of the Labour Party as a triumph of barbarism and the onset of a new \"Dark Age\".\nIn September 1945, after he was released by the army, he returned to Piers Court with his family (another daughter, Harriet, had been born at Pixton in 1944) but spent much of the next seven years either in London, or travelling. In March 1946, he visited the Nuremberg trials, and later that year, he was in Spain for a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the death of Francisco de Vitoria, said to be the founder of international law. Waugh wrote up his experiences of the frustrations of postwar European travel in a novella, \"Scott-King's Modern Europe\". In February 1947, he made the first of several trips to the United States, in the first instance to discuss filming of \"Brideshead\". The project collapsed, but Waugh used his time in Hollywood to visit the Forest Lawn cemetery, which provided the basis for his satire of American perspectives on death, \"The Loved One\" (1948). In 1951 he visited the Holy Land with his future biographer, Christopher Sykes, and in 1953, he travelled to Goa to witness the final exhibition before burial of the remains of the 16th-century Jesuit missionary-priest Francis Xavier.\nIn between his journeys, Waugh worked intermittently on \"Helena\", a long-planned novel about the discoverer of the True Cross that was by \"far the best book I have ever written or ever will write\". Its success with the public was limited, but it was, his daughter Harriet later said, \"the only one of his books that he ever cared to read aloud\".\nIn 1952 Waugh published \"Men at Arms\", the first of his semi-autobiographical war trilogy in which he depicted many of his personal experiences and encounters from the early stages of the war. Other books published during this period included \"When The Going Was Good\" (1946), an anthology of his pre-war travel writing, \"The Holy Places\" (published by the Ian Fleming-managed Queen Anne Press, 1952) and \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1953), a dystopian tale in which Waugh displays his contempt for the modern world. Nearing 50, Waugh was old for his years, \"selectively deaf, rheumatic, irascible\" and increasingly dependent on alcohol and on drugs to relieve his insomnia and depression. Two more children, James (born 1946) and Septimus (born 1950), completed his family.\nFrom 1945 onwards, Waugh became an avid collector, particularly of Victorian paintings and furniture. He filled Piers Court with his acquisitions, often from London's Portobello Market and from house clearance sales. His diary entry for 30 August 1946 records a visit to Gloucester, where he bought \"a lion of wood, finely carved for \u00a325, also a bookcase \u00a335\u00a0... a charming Chinese painting \u00a310, a Regency easel \u00a37\". Some of his buying was shrewd and prescient; he paid \u00a310 for Rossetti's \"Spirit of the Rainbow\" to begin a collection of Victorian paintings that eventually acquired great value. Waugh also began, from 1949, to write knowledgeable reviews and articles on the subject of painting.\nBreakdown.\nBy 1953, Waugh's popularity as a writer was declining. He was perceived as out of step with the \"Zeitgeist\", and the large fees he demanded were no longer easily available. His money was running out and progress on the second book of his war trilogy, \"Officers and Gentlemen\", had stalled. Partly because of his dependency on drugs, his health was steadily deteriorating. Shortage of cash led him to agree in November 1953 to be interviewed on BBC radio, where the panel took an aggressive line: \"they tried to make a fool of me, and I don't think they entirely succeeded\", Waugh wrote to Nancy Mitford. Peter Fleming in \"The Spectator\" likened the interview to \"the goading of a bull by matadors\".\nEarly in 1954, Waugh's doctors, concerned by his physical deterioration, advised a change of scene. On 29 January, he took a ship bound for Ceylon, hoping that he would be able to finish his novel. Within a few days, he was writing home complaining of \"other passengers whispering about me\" and of hearing voices, including that of his recent BBC interlocutor, Stephen Black. He left the ship in Egypt and flew on to Colombo, but, he wrote to Laura, the voices followed him. Alarmed, Laura sought help from her friend, Frances Donaldson, whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home. In fact, Waugh made his own way back, now believing that he was suffering from demonic possession. A brief medical examination indicated that Waugh was suffering from bromide poisoning from his drugs regimen. When his medication was changed, the voices and the other hallucinations quickly disappeared. Waugh was delighted, informing all of his friends that he had been mad: \"Clean off my onion!\". The experience was fictionalised a few years later, in \"The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold\" (1957).\nIn 1956, Edwin Newman made a short film about Waugh. In the course of it, Newman learned that Waugh hated the modern world and wished that he had been born two or three centuries sooner. Waugh disliked modern methods of transportation or communication, refused to drive or use the telephone, and wrote with an old-fashioned dip pen. He also expressed the views that American news reporters could not function without frequent infusions of whisky, and that every American had been divorced at least once.\nLate works.\nRestored to health, Waugh returned to work and finished \"Officers and Gentlemen\". In June 1955 the \"Daily Express\" journalist and reviewer Nancy Spain, accompanied by her friend Lord Noel-Buxton, arrived uninvited at Piers Court and demanded an interview. Waugh saw the pair off and wrote a wry account for \"The Spectator\", but he was troubled by the incident and decided to sell Piers Court: \"I felt it was polluted\", he told Nancy Mitford. Late in 1956, the family moved to Combe Florey House in the Somerset village of Combe Florey. In January 1957, Waugh avenged the Spain\u2013Noel-Buxton intrusion by winning libel damages from the \"Express\" and Spain. The paper had printed an article by Spain that suggested that the sales of Waugh's books were much lower than they were and that his worth, as a journalist, was low.\n\"Gilbert Pinfold\" was published in the summer of 1957, \"my barmy book\", Waugh called it. The extent to which the story is self-mockery, rather than true autobiography, became a subject of critical debate. Waugh's next major book was a biography of his longtime friend Ronald Knox, the Catholic writer and theologian who had died in August 1957. Research and writing extended over two years during which Waugh did little other work, delaying the third volume of his war trilogy. In June 1958, his son Auberon was severely wounded in a shooting accident while serving with the army in Cyprus. Waugh remained detached; he neither went to Cyprus nor immediately visited Auberon on the latter's return to Britain. The critic and literary biographer David Wykes called Waugh's sang-froid \"astonishing\" and the family's apparent acceptance of his behaviour even more so.\nAlthough most of Waugh's books had sold well, and he had been well-rewarded for his journalism, his levels of expenditure meant that money problems and tax bills were a recurrent feature in his life. In 1950, as a means of tax avoidance, he had set up a trust fund for his children (he termed it the \"Save the Children Fund\", after the well-established charity of that name) into which he placed the initial advance and all future royalties from the Penguin (paperback) editions of his books. He was able to augment his personal finances by charging household items to the trust or selling his own possessions to it. Nonetheless, by 1960, shortage of money led him to agree to an interview on BBC Television, in the \"Face to Face\" series conducted by John Freeman. The interview was broadcast on 26 June 1960; according to his biographer Selina Hastings, Waugh restrained his instinctive hostility and coolly answered the questions put to him by Freeman, assuming what she describes as a \"pose of world-weary boredom\".\nIn 1960, Waugh was offered the honour of a CBE but declined, believing that he should have been given the superior status of a knighthood. In September, he produced his final travel book, \"A Tourist in Africa\", based on a visit made in January\u2013March 1959. He enjoyed the trip but \"despised\" the book. The critic Cyril Connolly called it \"the thinnest piece of book-making that Mr Waugh has undertaken\". The book done, he worked on the last of the war trilogy, which was published in 1961 as \"Unconditional Surrender\".\nDecline and death.\nAs he approached his sixties, Waugh was in poor health, prematurely aged, \"fat, deaf, short of breath\", according to Patey. His biographer Martin Stannard likened his appearance around this time to that of \"an exhausted rogue jollied up by drink\". In 1962 Waugh began work on his autobiography, and that same year wrote his final fiction, the long short story \"Basil Seal Rides Again\". This revival of the protagonist of \"Black Mischief\" and \"Put Out More Flags\" was published in 1963; the \"Times Literary Supplement\" called it a \"nasty little book\". However, that same year, he was awarded with the title Companion of Literature by the Royal Society of Literature (its highest honour). When the first volume of autobiography, \"A Little Learning\", was published in 1964, Waugh's often oblique tone and discreet name changes ensured that friends avoided the embarrassments that some had feared.\nWaugh had welcomed the accession in 1958 of Pope John XXIII and wrote an appreciative tribute on the pope's death in 1963. However, he became increasingly concerned by the decisions emerging from the Second Vatican Council, which was convened by Pope John in October 1962 and continued under his successor, Pope Paul VI, until 1965. Waugh, a staunch opponent of Church reform, was particularly distressed by the replacement of the universal Latin Mass with the vernacular. In a \"Spectator\" article of 23 November 1962, he argued the case against change in a manner described by a later commentator as \"sharp-edged reasonableness\". He wrote to Nancy Mitford that \"the buggering up of the Church is a deep sorrow to me\u00a0... We write letters to the paper. A fat lot of good that does.\"\nIn 1965, a new financial crisis arose from an apparent flaw in the terms of the \"Save the Children\" trust, and a large sum of back tax was being demanded. Waugh's agent, A. D. Peters, negotiated a settlement with the tax authorities for a manageable amount, but in his concern to generate funds, Waugh signed contracts to write several books, including a history of the papacy, an illustrated book on the Crusades and a second volume of autobiography. Waugh's physical and mental deterioration prevented any work on these projects, and the contracts were cancelled. He described himself as \"toothless, deaf, melancholic, shaky on my pins, unable to eat, full of dope, quite idle\" and expressed the belief that \"all fates were worse than death\". His only significant literary activity in 1965 was the editing of the three war novels into a single volume, published as \"Sword of Honour\".\nOn Easter Day, 10 April 1966, after attending a Latin Mass in a neighbouring village with members of his family, Waugh died of heart failure at his Combe Florey home, aged 62. He was buried, by special arrangement, in a consecrated plot outside the Anglican churchyard of the Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Combe Florey. A Requiem Mass, in Latin, was celebrated in Westminster Cathedral on 21 April 1966.\nCharacter and opinions.\nIn the course of his lifetime, Waugh made enemies and offended many people; writer James Lees-Milne said that Waugh \"was the nastiest-tempered man in England\". Waugh's son, Auberon, said that the force of his father's personality was such that, despite his lack of height, \"generals and chancellors of the exchequer, six-foot-six and exuding self-importance from every pore, quail[ed] in front of him\".\nIn the biographic \"Mad World\" (2009), Paula Byrne said that the common view of Evelyn Waugh as a \"snobbish misanthrope\" is a caricature; she asks: \"Why would a man, who was so unpleasant, be so beloved by such a wide circle of friends?\" His generosity to individual persons and causes, especially Catholic causes, extended to small gestures; after his libel-court victory over Nancy Spain, he sent her a bottle of champagne. Hastings said that Waugh's outward personal belligerence to strangers was not entirely serious but an attempt at \"finding a sparring partner worthy of his own wit and ingenuity\". Besides mocking others, Waugh mocked himself\u2014the elderly buffer, \"crusty colonel\" image, which he presented in later life, was a comic impersonation, and not his true self.\nAs an instinctive conservative, Waugh believed that class divisions, with inequalities of wealth and position, were natural and that \"no form of government [was] ordained by God as being better than any other\". In the post-war \"Age of the Common Man\", he attacked socialism (the \"Cripps\u2013Attlee terror\") and complained, after Churchill's election in 1951, that \"the Conservative Party have never put the clock back a single second\". Waugh never voted in elections; in 1959, he expressed a hope that the Conservatives would win that year's election, which they did, but would not vote for them, saying \"I should feel I was morally inculpated in their follies\" and added: \"I do not aspire to advise my sovereign in her choice of servants\".\nWaugh's Catholicism was fundamental: \"The Church\u00a0... is the normal state of man from which men have disastrously exiled themselves.\" He believed that the Catholic Church was the last, great defence against the encroachment of the Dark Age being ushered in by the welfare state and the spreading of working-class culture. Strictly observant, Waugh admitted to Diana Cooper that his most difficult task was how to square the obligations of his faith with his indifference to his fellow men. When Nancy Mitford asked him how he reconciled his often objectionable conduct with being a Christian, Waugh replied that \"were he not a Christian he would be even more horrible\".\nWaugh's conservatism was aesthetic as well as political and religious. Although he praised younger writers, such as Angus Wilson, Muriel Spark and V. S. Naipaul, he was scornful of the 1950s writers' group known as \"The Movement\". He said that the literary world was \"sinking into black disaster\" and that literature might die within thirty years. As a schoolboy Waugh had praised Cubism, but he soon abandoned his interest in artistic modernism. In 1945, Waugh said that Pablo Picasso's artistic standing was the result of a \"mesmeric trick\" and that his paintings \"could not be intelligently discussed in the terms used of the civilised masters\". In 1953, in a radio interview, he named Augustus Egg (1816\u20131863) as a painter for whom he had particular esteem. Despite their political differences, Waugh came to admire George Orwell, because of their shared patriotism and sense of morality. Orwell in turn commented that Waugh was \"about as good a novelist as one can be\u00a0... while holding untenable opinions\".\nWaugh has been criticised for expressing racial and anti-semitic prejudices. Wykes describes Waugh's anti-semitism as \"his most persistently noticeable nastiness\", and his assumptions of white superiority as \"an illogical extension of his views on the naturalness and rightness of hierarchy as the principle of social organization\".\nWorks.\nThemes and style.\nWykes observes that Waugh's novels reprise and fictionalise the principal events of his life, although in an early essay Waugh wrote: \"Nothing is more insulting to a novelist than to assume that he is incapable of anything but the mere transcription of what he observes\". The reader should not assume that the author agreed with the opinions expressed by his fictional characters. Nevertheless, in the Introduction to the \"Complete Short Stories\", Ann Pasternak Slater said that the \"delineation of social prejudices and the language in which they are expressed is part of Waugh's meticulous observation of his contemporary world\".\nThe critic Clive James said of Waugh: \"Nobody ever wrote a more unaffectedly elegant English\u00a0... its hundreds of years of steady development culminate in him\". As his talent developed and matured, he maintained what literary critic Andrew Michael Roberts called \"an exquisite sense of the ludicrous, and a fine aptitude for exposing false attitudes\". In the first stages of his 40-year writing career, before his conversion to Catholicism in 1930, Waugh was the novelist of the Bright Young People generation. His first two novels, \"Decline and Fall\" (1928) and \"Vile Bodies\" (1930), comically reflect a futile society, populated by two-dimensional, basically unbelievable characters in circumstances too fantastic to evoke the reader's emotions. A typical Waugh trademark evident in the early novels is rapid, unattributed dialogue in which the participants can be readily identified. At the same time Waugh was writing serious essays, such as \"The War and the Younger Generation\", in which he castigates his own generation as \"crazy and sterile\" people.\nWaugh's conversion to Catholicism did not noticeably change the nature of his next two novels, \"Black Mischief\" (1934) and \"A Handful of Dust\" (1934), but, in the latter novel, the elements of farce are subdued, and the protagonist, Tony Last, is recognisably a person rather than a comic cipher. Waugh's first fiction with a Catholic theme was the short story \"Out of Depth\" (1933) about the immutability of the Mass. From the mid-1930s onwards, Catholicism and conservative politics were much featured in his journalistic and non-fiction writing before he reverted to his former manner with \"Scoop\" (1938), a novel about journalism, journalists, and unsavoury journalistic practices.\nIn \"Work Suspended and Other Stories\" Waugh introduced \"real\" characters and a first-person narrator, signalling the literary style he would adopt in \"Brideshead Revisited\" a few years later. \"Brideshead\", which questions the meaning of human existence without God, is the first novel in which Evelyn Waugh clearly presents his conservative religious and political views. In the \"Life\" magazine article \"Fan Fare\" (1946), Waugh said that \"you can only leave God out [of fiction] by making your characters pure abstractions\" and that his future novels shall be \"the attempt to represent man more fully which, to me, means only one thing, man in his relation to God.\" As such, the novel \"Helena\" (1950) is Evelyn Waugh's most philosophically Christian book.\nIn \"Brideshead\", the proletarian junior officer Hooper illustrates a theme that persists in Waugh's postwar fiction: the rise of mediocrity in the \"Age of the Common Man\". In the trilogy \"Sword of Honour\" (\"Men at Arms\", 1952; \"Officers and Gentlemen\", 1955, \"Unconditional Surrender\", 1961) the social pervasiveness of mediocrity is personified in the semi-comical character \"Trimmer\", a sloven and a fraud who triumphs by contrivance. In the novella \"Scott-King's Modern Europe\" (1947), Waugh's pessimism about the future is in the schoolmaster's admonition: \"I think it would be very wicked indeed to do anything to fit a boy for the modern world\". Likewise, such cynicism pervades the novel \"Love Among the Ruins\" (1953), set in a dystopian, welfare-state Britain that is so socially disagreeable that euthanasia is the most sought-after of the government's social services. Of the postwar novels, Patey says that \"The Ordeal of Gilbert Pinfold\" (1957) stands out \"a kind of mock-novel, a sly invitation to a game\". Waugh's final work of fiction, \"Basil Seal Rides Again\" (1962), features characters from the prewar novels; Waugh admitted that the work was a \"senile attempt to recapture the manner of my youth\". Stylistically this final story begins in the same fashion as the first story, \"The Balance\" of 1926, with a \"fusillade of unattributed dialogue\".\nReception.\nOf Waugh's early books, \"Decline and Fall\" was hailed by Arnold Bennett in the \"Evening Standard\" as \"an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire\". The critical reception of \"Vile Bodies\" two years later was even more enthusiastic, with Rebecca West predicting that Waugh was \"destined to be the dazzling figure of his age\". However, \"A Handful of Dust\", later widely regarded as a masterpiece, received a more muted welcome from critics, despite the author's own high estimation of the work. Chapter VI, \"Du C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Chez Todd\", of \"A Handful of Dust\", with Tony Last condemned forever to read Dickens to his mad jungle captor, was thought by the critic Henry Yorke to reduce an otherwise believable book to \"phantasy\". Cyril Connolly's first reaction to the book was that Waugh's powers were failing, an opinion that he later revised.\nIn the later 1930s, Waugh's inclination to Catholic and conservative polemics affected his standing with the general reading public. The Campion biography is said by David Wykes to be \"so rigidly biased that it has no claims to make as history\". The pro-fascist tone in parts of \"Waugh in Abyssinia\" offended readers and critics and prevented its publication in America. There was general relief among critics when \"Scoop\", in 1938, indicated a return to Waugh's earlier comic style. Critics had begun to think that his wit had been displaced by partisanship and propaganda.\nWaugh maintained his reputation in 1942, with \"Put Out More Flags\", which sold well despite wartime restrictions on paper and printing. Its public reception, however, did not compare with that accorded to \"Brideshead Revisited\" three years later, on both sides of the Atlantic. \"Brideshead\"'s selection as the American Book of the Month swelled its US sales to an extent that dwarfed those in Britain, which was affected by paper shortages. Despite the public's enthusiasm, critical opinion was split. \"Brideshead's\" Catholic standpoint offended some critics who had greeted Waugh's earlier novels with warm praise. Its perceived snobbery and its deference to the aristocracy were attacked by, among others, Conor Cruise O'Brien who, in the Irish literary magazine \"The Bell\", wrote of Waugh's \"almost mystical veneration\" for the upper classes. Fellow writer Rose Macaulay believed that Waugh's genius had been adversely affected by the intrusion of his right-wing partisan \"alter ego\" and that he had lost his detachment: \"In art so naturally ironic and detached as his, this is a serious loss\". Conversely, the book was praised by Yorke, Graham Greene and, in glowing terms, by Harold Acton who was particularly impressed by its evocation of 1920s Oxford. In 1959, at the request of publishers Chapman and Hall and in some deference to his critics, Waugh revised the book and wrote in a preface: \"I have modified the grosser passages but not obliterated them because they are an essential part of the book\".\nIn \"Fan Fare\", Waugh forecasts that his future books will be unpopular because of their religious theme. On publication in 1950, \"Helena\" was received indifferently by the public and by critics, who disparaged the awkward mixing of 20th-century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose. Otherwise, Waugh's prediction proved unfounded; all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy. During his successful 1957 lawsuit against the \"Daily Express\", Waugh's counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books, two thirds in Britain and the rest in America. \"Men at Arms\", the first volume of his war trilogy, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1953; initial critical comment was lukewarm, with Connolly likening \"Men at Arms\" to beer rather than champagne. Connolly changed his view later, calling the completed trilogy \"the finest novel to come out of the war\". Of Waugh's other major postwar works, the Knox biography was admired within Waugh's close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy. The book did not sell well\u2014\"like warm cakes\", according to Waugh. \"Pinfold\" surprised the critics by its originality. Its plainly autobiographical content, Hastings suggests, gave the public a fixed image of Waugh: \"stout, splenetic, red-faced and reactionary, a figure from burlesque complete with cigar, bowler hat and loud checked suit\".\nReputation.\nIn 1973, Waugh's diaries were serialised in \"The Observer\" prior to publication in book form in 1976. The revelations about his private life, thoughts and attitudes created controversy. Although Waugh had removed embarrassing entries relating to his Oxford years and his first marriage, there was sufficient left on the record to enable enemies to project a negative image of the writer as intolerant, snobbish and sadistic, with pronounced fascist leanings. Some of this picture, it was maintained by Waugh's supporters, arose from poor editing of the diaries, and a desire to transform Waugh from a writer to a \"character\". Nevertheless, a popular conception developed of Waugh as a monster. When, in 1980, a selection of his letters was published, his reputation became the subject of further discussion. Philip Larkin, reviewing the collection in \"The Guardian\", thought that it demonstrated Waugh's elitism; to receive a letter from him, it seemed, \"one would have to have a nursery nickname and be a member of White's, a Roman Catholic, a high-born lady or an Old Etonian novelist\".\nThe publication of the diaries and letters promoted increased interest in Waugh and his works and caused publication of much new material. Christopher Sykes's biography had appeared in 1975, between 1980 and 1998 three more full biographies were issued and other biographical and critical studies have continued to be produced. A collection of Waugh's journalism and reviews was published in 1983, revealing a fuller range of his ideas and beliefs. The new material provided further grounds for debate between Waugh's supporters and detractors.\nThe 1981 Granada Television adaptation of \"Brideshead Revisited\" introduced a new generation to Waugh's works, in Britain and in America. There had been earlier television treatment of Waugh's fiction, as \"Sword of Honour\" had been serialised by the BBC in 1967, but the impact of Granada's \"Brideshead\" was much wider. Its nostalgic depiction of a vanished form of Englishness appealed to the American mass market; \"Time\" magazine's TV critic described the series as \"a novel\u00a0... made into a poem\", and listed it among the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". There have been further cinematic Waugh adaptations: \"A Handful of Dust\" in 1988, \"Vile Bodies\" (filmed as \"Bright Young Things\") in 2003 and \"Brideshead Revisited\" again in 2008. These popular treatments have maintained the public's appetite for Waugh's novels, all of which remain in print and continue to sell. Several have been listed among various compiled lists of the world's greatest novels.\nStannard concludes that beneath his public mask, Waugh was \"a dedicated artist and a man of earnest faith, struggling against the dryness of his soul\". Graham Greene, in a letter to \"The Times\" shortly after Waugh's death, acknowledged him as \"the greatest novelist of my generation\", while \"Time\" magazine's obituarist called him \"the grand old mandarin of modern British prose\" and asserted that his novels \"will continue to survive as long as there are readers who can savor what critic V. S. Pritchett calls 'the beauty of his malice'\u00a0\". Nancy Mitford said of him in a television interview, \"What nobody remembers about Evelyn is that everything with him was jokes. Everything. That's what none of the people who wrote about him seem to have taken into account at all\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Contemporary artists work in a globally influenced, culturally diverse, and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of materials, methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or \"-ism\". Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.\nIn English, \"modern\" and \"contemporary\" are synonyms, resulting in some conflation and confusion of the terms \"modern art\" and \"contemporary art\" by non-specialists. Some specialists also consider that the frontier between the two is blurry; for instance, the French Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne does not differentiate them in its collections.\nScope.\nThe classification of \"contemporary art\" as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of Modernism in the English-speaking world. In London, the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic Roger Fry and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums. A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the Contemporary Art Society of Adelaide, Australia, and an increasing number after 1945. Many, like the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston changed their names from ones using \"modern art\" in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical art movement, and much \"modern\" art ceased to be \"contemporary\". The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.\nParticular points that have been seen as marking a change in art styles include the end of World War II and the 1960s. There has perhaps been a lack of natural break points since the 1960s, and definitions of what constitutes \"contemporary art\" in the 2010s vary, and are mostly imprecise. Art from the past 20 years is very likely to be included, and definitions often include art going back to about 1970; \"the art of the late 20th and early 21st century\"; \"both an outgrowth and a rejection of modern art\"; \"Strictly speaking, the term 'contemporary art' refers to art made and produced by artists living today\"; \"Art from the 1960s or [19]70s up until this very minute\"; and sometimes further, especially in museum contexts, as museums which form a permanent collection of contemporary art inevitably find this aging. Many use the formulation \"Modern and Contemporary Art\", which avoids this problem. Smaller commercial galleries, magazines and other sources may use stricter definitions, perhaps restricting the \"contemporary\" to work from 2000 onwards. Artists who are still productive after a long career, and ongoing art movements, may present a particular issue; galleries and critics are often reluctant to divide their work between the contemporary and non-contemporary.\nSociologist Nathalie Heinich draws a distinction between modern and contemporary art, describing them as two different paradigms which partially overlap historically. She found that while \"modern art\" challenges the conventions of representation, \"contemporary art\" challenges the very notion of an artwork. She regards Duchamp's \"Fountain\" (which was made in the 1910s in the midst of the triumph of modern art) as the starting point of contemporary art, which gained momentum after World War II with Gutai's performances, Yves Klein's monochromes and Rauschenberg's \"Erased de Kooning Drawing\".\nThemes.\nContemporary artwork is characterised by diversity: diversity of material, of form, of subject matter, and even time periods. It is \"distinguished by the very lack of a uniform organizing principle, ideology, or - ism\" that is seen in many other art periods and movements. Contemporary art does not have one, single objective or point of view, so it can be contradictory and open-ended. There are nonetheless several common themes that have appeared in contemporary works, such as identity politics, the body, globalization and migration, technology, contemporary society and culture, time and memory, and institutional and political critique. Contemporary art has increasingly reflected themes of globalization, migration, and cultural identity since the late 20th century. Examples include works addressing immigration and displacement in urban contexts.\nInstitutions.\nThe functioning of the art world is dependent on art institutions, ranging from major museums to private galleries, non-profit spaces, foundations, art schools and publishers, and the practices of individual artists, curators, writers, collectors, and philanthropists. A major division in the art world is between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, although in recent years the boundaries between for-profit private and non-profit public institutions have become increasingly blurred. Most well-known contemporary art is exhibited by professional artists at commercial contemporary art galleries, by private collectors, art auctions, corporations, publicly funded arts organizations, contemporary art museums or by artists themselves in artist-run spaces. Contemporary artists are supported by grants, awards, and prizes as well as by direct sales of their work. Career artists train at art school or emerge from other fields. In recent years, fashion illustration has seen a revival through social media platforms, where independent artists have gained visibility by sharing their work digitally.\nThere are close relationships between publicly funded contemporary art organizations and the commercial sector. For instance, in 2005 the book \"Understanding International Art Markets and Management\" reported that in Britain a handful of dealers represented the artists featured in leading publicly funded contemporary art museums. Commercial organizations include galleries and art fairs.\nCorporations have also integrated themselves into the contemporary art world, exhibiting contemporary art within their premises, organizing and sponsoring contemporary art awards, and building up extensive corporate collections. Corporate advertisers frequently use the prestige associated with contemporary art and coolhunting to draw the attention of consumers to luxury goods.\nThe institutions of art have been criticized for regulating what is designated as contemporary art. Outsider art, for instance, is literally contemporary art, in that it is produced in the present day. However, one critic has argued it is not considered so because the artists are self-taught and are thus assumed to be working outside of an art historical context. Craft activities, such as textile design, are also excluded from the realm of contemporary art, despite large audiences for exhibitions. Art critic Peter Timms has said that attention is drawn to the way that craft objects must subscribe to particular values in order to be admitted to the realm of contemporary art. \"A ceramic object that is intended as a subversive comment on the nature of beauty is more likely to fit the definition of contemporary art than one that is simply beautiful.\"\nPublic attitudes.\nContemporary art can sometimes seem at odds with a public that does not feel that art and its institutions share its values. In Britain, in the 1990s, contemporary art became a part of popular culture, with artists becoming stars, but this did not lead to a hoped-for \"cultural utopia\". Some critics like Julian Spalding and Donald Kuspit have suggested that skepticism, even rejection, is a legitimate and reasonable response to much contemporary art. Brian Ashbee in an essay called \"Art Bollocks\" criticizes \"much installation art, photography, conceptual art, video and other practices generally called post-modern\" as being too dependent on verbal explanations in the form of theoretical discourse. However, the acceptance of nontraditional art in museums has increased due to changing perspectives on what constitutes an art piece.\nConcerns.\nA common concern since the early part of the 20th century has been the question of what constitutes art. In the contemporary period (1970 to now), the concept of avant-garde may come into play in determining what artworks are noticed by galleries, museums, and collectors.\nThe concerns of contemporary art come in for criticism too. Andrea Rosen has said that some contemporary painters \"have absolutely no idea of what it means to be a contemporary artist\" and that they \"are in it for all the wrong reasons.\"\nPrizes.\nSome competitions, awards, and prizes in contemporary art are:\nHistory.\nThis table lists art movements and styles by decade.

The discourses and the songs involved suggestiveness and double entendre. Rambling Syd was customarily introduced by Kenneth Horne, who would set things up by (for example) inquiring as to the nature and origin of the song. Rambling Syd would usually respond with an \"Ello, me dearios\", before launching into the ensuing detailed explanation, which left a great deal to the imagination.\nThe songs themselves pushed and extended boundaries of sexual suggestiveness, using nonsense (or little-known) words such as \"moolies\" and \"nadgers\" in suggestive contexts. Many of the words used by Rambling Syd were invented by the \"Round the Horne\" scriptwriters Barry Took and Marty Feldman, who wrote the majority of the songs' lyrics, based upon traditional folk songs. Some were existing words used in a suggestive context, such as \"artefacts\" (often used in an archaeological context for items such as grave goods) and \"nadgers\", which had already appeared in \"The Goon Show\".\nOn 3 July 1967, Williams, in the guise of Rambling Syd, recorded a series of the songs before a live audience at Abbey Road Studios. In his diary, Williams wrote that, \"the laughter was so intrusive it broke up the rhythm of some of the songs\".

Streep's mother, whom she has compared in both appearance and manner to Dame Judi Dench, strongly encouraged her daughter and instilled confidence in her from a very young age. Streep said, \"She was a mentor because she said to me, 'Meryl, you're capable. You're so great.' She was saying, 'You can do whatever you put your mind to. If you're lazy, you're not going to get it done. But if you put your mind to it, you can do anything.' And I believed her.\" Although she was naturally more introverted than her mother, when she later needed an injection of confidence in adulthood, she would consult her mother at times for advice. \nStreep was raised as a Presbyterian in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and attended Cedar Hill Elementary School and the Oak Street School, which was a junior high school at that time. In her junior high debut, she starred as Louise Heller in the play \"The Family Upstairs\". In 1963, the family moved to Bernardsville, New Jersey, where she attended Bernards High School. Author Karina Longworth described her as a \"gawky kid with glasses and frizzy hair\", yet noted that she liked to show off in front of the camera in family home movies from a young age. At age 12, Streep was selected to sing at a school recital, leading to her having opera lessons from Estelle Liebling. Despite her talent, she later remarked, \"I was singing something I didn't feel and understand. That was an important lesson\u2014not to do that. To find the thing that I could feel through.\" She quit after four years. Streep had many Catholic school friends, and regularly attended Mass. She was a high school cheerleader for the Bernards High School Mountaineers. She was also chosen as the homecoming queen her senior year. \nAlthough Streep appeared in numerous school plays during her high school years, she was uninterested in serious theater until acting in the play \"Miss Julie\" at Vassar College in 1969, in which she gained attention across the campus. Vassar drama professor Clinton J. Atkinson noted, \"I don't think anyone ever taught Meryl acting. She really taught herself.\" Streep demonstrated an early ability to mimic accents and to quickly memorize her lines. She earned her AB in drama \"cum laude\" in 1971, before applying for a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) degree from the Yale School of Drama. At Yale, she supplemented her course fees by working as a waitress and typist, and appeared in over a dozen stage productions per year; at one point, she became overworked and developed ulcers, so she contemplated quitting acting and switching to study law. Streep played a variety of roles on stage, from Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" to an 80-year-old woman in a wheelchair in a comedy written by then-unknown playwrights Christopher Durang and Albert Innaurato. She was a student of choreographer Carmen de Lavallade, whom she introduced at the 2017 Kennedy Center Honors. Another of her teachers was Robert Lewis, a co-founder of the Actors Studio. Streep disapproved of some of the acting exercises she was asked to do, remarking that one professor taught the emotional recall technique by delving into personal lives in a way she found \"obnoxious\". She earned her MFA in drama from Yale in 1975. She also enrolled as a visiting student at Dartmouth College in 1970, and received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the college in 1981.\nCareer.\n1970s: Early work and breakthrough.\nOne of Streep's first professional jobs in 1975 was at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference, during which she acted in five plays over six weeks. She moved to New York City in 1975, and was cast by Joseph Papp in a production of \"Trelawny of the Wells\" at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, opposite Mandy Patinkin and John Lithgow. She went on to appear in five more roles in her first year in New York, including in Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival productions of \"Henry V\", \"The Taming of the Shrew\" with Raul Julia, and \"Measure for Measure\" opposite Sam Waterston and John Cazale. She entered into a relationship with Cazale at this time, and resided with him until his death three years later. She starred in the musical \"Happy End\" on Broadway, and won an Obie for her performance in the off-Broadway play \"Alice at the Palace\".\nAlthough Streep had not aspired to become a film actor, Robert De Niro's performance in \"Taxi Driver\" (1976) had a profound impact on her; she said to herself, 'That's the kind of actor I want to be when I grow up.' Streep began auditioning for film roles, and underwent an unsuccessful audition for the lead role in Dino De Laurentiis's remake of the action adventure \"King Kong\" which was released in 1976. De Laurentiis, referring to Streep as she stood before him, said in Italian to his son: \"This is so ugly. Why did you bring me this?\" Unknown to Laurentiis, Streep understood Italian, and she remarked, \"I'm very sorry that I'm not as beautiful as I should be, but, you know \u2013 this is it. This is what you get.\" She continued to work on Broadway, appearing in the 1976 double bill of Tennessee Williams' \"27 Wagons Full of Cotton\" and Arthur Miller's \"A Memory of Two Mondays\". She received a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Streep's other Broadway credits include Anton Chekhov's \"The Cherry Orchard\" and the Bertolt Brecht-Kurt Weill musical \"Happy End\", in which she had originally appeared off-Broadway at the Chelsea Theater Center. She received Drama Desk Award nominations for both productions.\nStreep's first feature film role came opposite Jane Fonda in the 1977 film \"Julia\", in which she had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress, \"I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I hate this business.\" However, Streep stated in 2015 that Fonda had a lasting influence on her as an actress, and credited her with opening \"probably more doors than I probably even know about\". Robert De Niro, who had spotted Streep in her stage production of \"The Cherry Orchard\", suggested that she play the role of his girlfriend in the war film \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978). Cazale, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer, was also cast in the film, and Streep took on the role of a \"vague, stock girlfriend\" to remain with Cazale for the duration of filming. Longworth notes that Streep, \"Made a case for female empowerment by playing a woman to whom empowerment was a foreign concept\u2013a normal lady from an average American small town, for whom subservience was the only thing she knew\". Pauline Kael, who later became a strong critic of Streep, remarked that she was a \"real beauty\" who brought much freshness to the film with her performance. The film's success exposed Streep to a wider audience and earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\nIn the 1978 miniseries \"Holocaust\", Streep played the leading role of a German woman married to a Jewish artist played by James Woods in Nazi era Germany. She found the material to be \"unrelentingly noble\" and professed to have taken on the role for financial gain. Streep travelled to Germany and Austria for filming while Cazale remained in New York. Upon her return, Streep found that Cazale's illness had progressed, and she nursed him until his death on March 12, 1978. With an estimated audience of 109 million, \"Holocaust\" brought a wider degree of public recognition to Streep, who found herself \"on the verge of national visibility\". She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her performance. Despite the awards success, Streep was still not enthusiastic towards her film career and preferred acting on stage.\nShe played the supporting role of Leilah in Wendy Wasserstein's \"Uncommon Women and Others\" in a May 1978 \"Theater in America\" television production for PBS's Great Performances. She replaced Glenn Close, who played the role in the Off-Broadway production at the Phoenix Theatre. Hoping to divert herself from the grief of Cazale's death, Streep accepted a role in \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on \"automatic pilot\". She performed the role of Katherine in \"The Taming of the Shrew\" for Shakespeare in the Park. That same year she played a supporting role as the former girlfriend turned lesbian in \"Manhattan\" (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" described her performance as being \"beautifully played\". \nIn the drama \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as \"too evil\" and insisted that it was not representative of real women who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who \"hated her guts\" at first. Hoffman and producer Stanley R. Jaffe later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting: \"She's extraordinarily hard-working, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else, but what she's doing.\" The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's \"own emotional intensity\", writing that she was one of the \"rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery\". \nFor the film, Streep won both the Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, which she famously left in the ladies' room after giving her speech. She received awards from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, National Board of Review and National Society of Film Critics for her collective work in her three film releases of 1979. Both \"The Deer Hunter\" and \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" were major commercial successes and were consecutive winners of the Academy Award for Best Picture.\n1980s: Rise to prominence.\nIn 1979, Streep began workshopping \"Alice in Concert\", a musical version of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", with writer and composer Elizabeth Swados and director Joseph Papp; the show was put on at New York's Public Theater from December 1980. Frank Rich of \"The New York Times\" referred to Streep as the production's \"one wonder\", but questioned why she devoted so much energy to it. By 1980, Streep had progressed to leading roles in films. She was featured on the cover of \"Newsweek\" magazine with the headline \"A Star for the 80s\"; Jack Kroll commented, \"There's a sense of mystery in her acting; she doesn't simply imitate (although she's a great mimic in private). She transmits a sense of danger, a primal unease lying just below the surface of normal behavior\".\nStreep denounced her fervent media coverage at the time as \"excessive hype\". The story within a story drama \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981) was Streep's first leading role. The film paired Streep with Jeremy Irons as contemporary actors, telling their modern story, as well as the Victorian era drama they were performing. Streep developed an English accent for the part, but considered herself a misfit for the role: \"I couldn't help wishing that I was more beautiful\". A \"New York\" magazine article commented that, while many female stars of the past had cultivated a singular identity in their films, Streep was a \"chameleon\", willing to play any type of role. Streep was awarded a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her work. The following year, she re-united with Robert Benton for the psychological thriller, \"Still of the Night\" (1982), co-starring Roy Scheider and Jessica Tandy. Vincent Canby, writing for \"The New York Times\", noted that the film was an homage to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, but that one of its main weaknesses was a lack of chemistry between Streep and Scheider, concluding that Streep \"is stunning, but she's not on screen anywhere near long enough\".\nGreater success came later in the year when Streep starred in the drama \"Sophie's Choice\" (also 1982), portraying a Polish survivor of Auschwitz caught in a love triangle between a young na\u00efve writer (Peter MacNicol) and a Jewish intellectual (Kevin Kline). Streep's emotional dramatic performance and her apparent mastery of a Polish accent drew praise. William Styron wrote the novel with Ursula Andress in mind for the role of Sophie, but Streep was determined to get the role. Streep filmed the \"choice\" scene in one take and refused to do it again, finding it extremely painful and emotionally exhausting. That scene, in which Streep is ordered by an SS guard at Auschwitz to choose which of her two children would be gassed and which would proceed to the labor camp, is her most famous scene, according to Emma Brockes of \"The Guardian\" who wrote in 2006: \"It's classic Streep, the kind of scene that makes your scalp tighten, but defter in a way is her handling of smaller, harder-to-grasp emotions\". \nAmong several acting awards, Streep won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance, and her characterization was voted the third greatest movie performance of all time by \"Premiere\" magazine. Roger Ebert said of her delivery, \"Streep plays the Brooklyn scenes with an enchanting Polish-American accent (she has the first accent I've ever wanted to hug), and she plays the flashbacks in subtitled German and Polish. There is hardly an emotion that Streep doesn't touch in this movie, and yet we're never aware of her straining. This is one of the most astonishing and yet one of the most unaffected and natural performances I can imagine\". Pauline Kael, on the contrary, called the film an \"infuriatingly bad movie\", and thought that Streep \"decorporealizes\" herself, which she believed explained why her movie heroines \"don't seem to be full characters, and why there are no incidental joys to be had from watching her\".\nIn 1983, Streep played her first non-fictional character, the nuclear whistleblower and labor union activist Karen Silkwood, who died in a suspicious car accident while investigating alleged wrongdoing at the Kerr-McGee plutonium plant, in Mike Nichols' biographical film \"Silkwood\". Streep felt a personal connection to Silkwood, and in preparation, she met with people close to the woman, and in doing so realized that each person saw a different aspect of her personality. She said, \"I didn't try to turn myself into Karen. I just tried to look at what she did. I put together every piece of information I could find about her ... What I finally did was look at the events in her life, and try to understand her from the inside\". Jack Kroll of \"Newsweek\" considered Streep's characterization to have been \"brilliant\", while Silkwood's boyfriend Drew Stephens expressed approval in that Streep had played Karen as a human being rather than a myth, despite Karen's father Bill thinking that Streep and the film had dumbed his daughter down. Pauline Kael believed that Streep had been miscast. \nStreep next played opposite Robert De Niro in the romance \"Falling in Love\" (1984), which was poorly received. She portrayed a fighter for the French Resistance during World War II in the British drama \"Plenty\" (1985), adapted from the play by David Hare. For the latter, Roger Ebert wrote that she conveyed \"great subtlety; it is hard to play an unbalanced, neurotic, self-destructive woman, and do it with such gentleness and charm ... Streep creates a whole character around a woman who could have simply been a catalogue of symptoms.\" In 2008, Molly Haskell praised Streep's performance in \"Plenty\", believing it to be \"one of Streep's most difficult and ambiguous\" films and \"most feminist\" role.\nLongworth considers Streep's next release, \"Out of Africa\" (1985), to have established her as a Hollywood superstar. In the film, Streep starred as the Danish writer Karen Blixen, opposite Robert Redford's Denys Finch Hatton. Director Sydney Pollack was initially dubious about Streep in the role, as he did not think she was sexy enough, and had considered Jane Seymour for the part. Pollack recalls that Streep impressed him in a different way: \"She was so direct, so honest, so without bullshit. There was no shielding between her and me.\" Streep and Pollack often clashed during the 101-day shoot in Kenya, particularly over Blixen's voice. Streep had spent much time listening to tapes of Blixen, and began speaking in an old-fashioned and aristocratic fashion, which Pollack thought excessive. A significant commercial success, the film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture. It also earned Streep another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and the film ultimately won Best Picture. Film critic Stanley Kauffmann praised her performance, writing \"Meryl Streep is back in top form. This means her performance in \"Out of Africa\" is at the highest level of acting in film today.\"\nLongworth notes that the dramatic success of \"Out of Africa\" led to a backlash of critical opinion against Streep in the years that followed, especially as she was now demanding $4 million a picture. Unlike other stars at the time, such as Sylvester Stallone and Tom Cruise, Streep \"never seemed to play herself\", and certain critics felt her technical finesse led people to literally see her acting. Her next films did not appeal to a wide audience; she co-starred with Jack Nicholson in the dramas \"Heartburn\" (1986) and \"Ironweed\" (1987), in which she sang onscreen for the first time since the \"Great Performances\" telecast of the Phoenix Theater production of \"Secret Service\" (1977). In \"Evil Angels\" (1988), she played Lindy Chamberlain, an Australian woman who had been convicted of the murder of her infant daughter despite claiming that the baby had been taken by a dingo. Filmed in Australia, Streep won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, a Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress. Streep has said of developing the Australian accent in the film: \"I had to study a little bit for Australian because it's not dissimilar [to American], so it's like coming from Italian to Spanish. You get a little mixed up.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" referred to her performance as \"another stunning performance\", played with \"the kind of virtuosity that seems to re-define the possibilities of screen acting\".\nIn 1989, Streep lobbied to play the lead role in Oliver Stone's adaption of the play \"Evita\", but two months before filming was due to commence, she dropped out, citing \"exhaustion\" initially, although it was later revealed that there was a dispute over her salary. By the end of the decade, Streep actively looked to star in a comedy. She found the role in \"She-Devil\" (1989), a satire that parodied societal obsession with beauty and cosmetic surgery, in which she played a glamorous writer. Though the film was not a success, Richard Corliss of \"Time\" wrote that Streep was the \"one reason\" to see it, and observed that it marked a departure from the dramatic roles she was known to play. Reacting to her string of poorly received films, Streep said: \"Audiences are shrinking; as the marketing strategy defines more and more narrowly who they want to reach males from 16 to 25 \u2013 it's become a chicken-and-egg syndrome. Which came first? First, they release all these summer movies, then do a demographic survey of who's going to see them.\"\n1990s: Commercial fluctuations.\nBiographer Karen Hollinger described the early 1990s as a downturn in the popularity of Streep's films, attributing this partly to a critical perception that her comedies had been an attempt to convey a lighter image following several serious, but commercially unsuccessful, dramas, and, more significantly, to the lack of options available to an actress in her forties. Streep commented that she had limited her options by her preference to work in Los Angeles, close to her family, a situation that she had anticipated in a 1981 interview when she commented, \"By the time an actress hits her mid-forties, no one's interested in her anymore. And if you want to fit a couple of babies into that schedule as well, you've got to pick your parts with great care.\" At the Screen Actor's Guild National Women's Conference in 1990, Streep keynoted the first national event, emphasizing the decline in women's work opportunities, pay parity, and role models within the film industry. She criticized the film industry for downplaying the importance of women both on screen and off.\nAfter roles in the comedy-drama \"Postcards from the Edge\" (1990), and the comedy-fantasy \"Defending Your Life\" (1991), Streep starred with Goldie Hawn in the farcical black comedy, \"Death Becomes Her\" (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to re-write several of the scenes, particularly the one in which her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was \"unrealistically male\" in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which she got into character by \"thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time\". Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that they made her look nearer 70. Longworth considers \"Death Becomes Her\" to have been \"the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling\". Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1 million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. \"Time\"'s Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's \"wicked-witch routine\" but dismissed the film as \"\"She-Devil\" with a make-over\" and one which \"hates women\". Streep later admitted to having disliked filming the scenes involving heavy special effects, and vowed never to work again on a film with heavy special effects.\nStreep appeared with Jeremy Irons, Glenn Close and Winona Ryder in \"The House of the Spirits\" (1993), set in Chile during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. The film was not well received by critics. Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" wrote: \"This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever\". The following year, Streep starred in \"The River Wild\", as the mother of children on a whitewater rafting trip who encounter two violent criminals (Kevin Bacon and John C. Reilly) in the wilderness. Though critical reaction was generally mixed, Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" found her to be \"strong, sassy and looser than she has ever been onscreen\".\nStreep's most successful film of the decade was the romantic drama \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995) directed by Clint Eastwood, who adapted the film from Robert James Waller's novel of the same name. It relates the story of Robert Kincaid (Eastwood), a photographer working for \"National Geographic\", who has a love affair with a middle-aged Italian farm wife Francesca (Streep). Though Streep disliked the novel it was based on, she found the script to be a special opportunity for an actress her age. She gained weight for the part and dressed differently from the character in the book to emulate voluptuous Italian film stars such as Sophia Loren. Both Loren and Anna Magnani were an influence in her portrayal, and Streep viewed Pier Paolo Pasolini's \"Mamma Roma\" (1962) prior to filming. The film was a box office hit and grossed over $70 million in the United States. The film, unlike the novel, was warmly received by critics. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote that Eastwood had managed to create \"a moving, elegiac love story at the heart of Mr. Waller's self-congratulatory overkill\", while Joe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\" described it as \"one of the most pleasurable films in recent memory\". Longworth believes that Streep's performance was \"crucial to transforming what could have been a weak soap opera into a vibrant work of historical fiction implicitly critiquing postwar America's stifling culture of domesticity\". She considers it to have been the role in which Streep became \"arguably the first middle-aged actress to be taken seriously by Hollywood as a romantic heroine\".\nStreep played the estranged sister of Bessie (Diane Keaton), a woman battling leukemia, in \"Marvin's Room\" (1996), an adaptation of the play by Scott McPherson. Streep recommended Keaton for the role. Roger Ebert stated that, \"Streep and Keaton, in their different styles, find ways to make Lee and Bessie into much more than the expression of their problems.\" The film was well received, and Streep earned another Golden Globe nomination for her performance.\nStreep's performance in \"...First Do No Harm\" (1997) garnered her a second Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress \u2013 Miniseries or a Movie. In 1998, Streep first appeared opposite Michael Gambon and Catherine McCormack in Pat O'Connor's \"Dancing at Lughnasa\", another Broadway adaptation, which was entered into the Venice Film Festival in its year of release. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" remarked that \"Meryl Streep has made many a grand acting gesture in her career, but the way she simply peers out a window in \"Dancing at Lughnasa\" ranks with the best. Everything the viewer need know about Kate Mundy, the woman she plays here, is written on that prim, lonely face and its flabbergasted gaze.\" Later that year, she played a housewife dying of cancer in \"One True Thing\". The film met with positive reviews. Mick LaSalle in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" declared, \"After \"One True Thing\", critics who persist in the fiction that Streep is a cold and technical actress will need to get their heads examined. She is so instinctive and natural \u2013 so thoroughly in the moment and operating on flights of inspiration \u2013 that she's able to give us a woman who's at once wildly idiosyncratic and utterly believable.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" film critic Kenneth Turan noted that her role \"is one of the least self-consciously dramatic and surface showy of her career,\" but she \"adds a level of honesty and reality that makes [her performance] one of her most moving\".\nStreep portrayed Roberta Guaspari in the music drama \"Music of the Heart\" (1999). Streep received nominations for an Academy Award, a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance. Roger Ebert wrote: Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you've heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari's speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep's other accents. This is not Streep's voice, but someone else's \u2013 with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.\n2000s: Career resurgence and stage work.\nStreep entered the 2000s with a voice cameo in Steven Spielberg's \"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\" (2001), a science fiction film about a childlike android, played by Haley Joel Osment. The same year, Streep co-hosted the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert with Liam Neeson which was held in Oslo, Norway, on December 11, 2001, in honour of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate, the United Nations and Kofi Annan. In 2001, Streep returned to the stage for the first time in more than twenty years, playing Arkadina in The Public Theater's revival of Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\", directed by Mike Nichols and co-starring Kevin Kline, Natalie Portman, John Goodman, Marcia Gay Harden, Stephen Spinella, Debra Monk, Larry Pine and Philip Seymour Hoffman. \nThe same year, Streep began work on Spike Jonze's comedy-drama \"Adaptation.\" (2002), in which she portrayed real-life journalist Susan Orlean. Lauded by critics and viewers alike, the film won Streep her fourth Golden Globe in the Best Supporting Actress category. A. O. Scott in \"The New York Times\" considered Streep's portrayal of Orlean to have been \"played with impish composure\", noting the contrast in her \"wittily realized\" character with love interest Chris Cooper's \"lank-haired, toothless charisma\" as the autodidact arrested for poaching rare orchids. Streep appeared alongside Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore in Stephen Daldry's \"The Hours\" (2002), based on the 1999 novel by Michael Cunningham. Focusing on three women of different generations whose lives are interconnected by the novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" by Virginia Woolf, the film was generally well received and won all three leading actresses a Silver Bear for Best Actress.\nIn 2003, Streep re-united with Mike Nichols to star with Al Pacino and Emma Thompson in the HBO's adaptation of Tony Kushner's six-hour play \"Angels in America\", the story of two couples whose relationships dissolve amidst the backdrop of Reagan era politics. Streep, who was cast in four roles in the miniseries, received her second Emmy Award and fifth Golden Globe for her performance. She appeared in Jonathan Demme's moderately successful remake of \"The Manchurian Candidate\" in 2004, co-starring Denzel Washington, playing the role of a woman who is both a U.S. senator and the manipulative, ruthless mother of a vice-presidential candidate. The same year, she played the supporting role of Aunt Josephine in \"Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events\" alongside Jim Carrey, based on the first three novels in Snicket's book series. The black comedy received generally favorable reviews from critics, and won the Academy Award for Best Makeup. Streep also narrated the film \"Monet's Palate\". Streep was next cast in the comedy film \"Prime\" (2005), directed by Ben Younger. In the film, she played Lisa Metzger, the Jewish psychoanalyst of a divorced and lonesome business-woman, played by Uma Thurman, who enters a relationship with Metzger's 23-year-old son (Bryan Greenberg). A modest mainstream success, it eventually grossed US$67.9 million internationally. Roger Ebert noted how Streep had \"that ability to cut through the solemnity of a scene with a zinger that reveals how all human effort is, after all, comic at some level\".\nIn August and September 2006, Streep starred onstage at The Public Theater's production of \"Mother Courage and Her Children\" at the Delacorte Theatre in Central Park. The Public Theater production was a new translation by playwright Tony Kushner, with songs in the Weill/Brecht style written by composer Jeanine Tesori; veteran director George C. Wolfe was at the helm. Streep starred alongside Kevin Kline and Austin Pendleton in this three-and-a-half-hour play. Around the same time, Streep, along with Lily Tomlin, portrayed the last two members of what was once a popular family country music act in Robert Altman's final film \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (2006). A comedic ensemble piece featuring Lindsay Lohan, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Kline and Woody Harrelson, the film revolves around the behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running public radio show of the same name. The film grossed more than US$26 million, the majority of which came from domestic markets.\nCommercially, Streep fared better with a role in \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (also 2006), a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. Streep portrayed the powerful and demanding Miranda Priestly, fashion magazine editor (and boss of a recent college graduate played by Anne Hathaway). Though the overall film received mixed reviews, her portrayal, of what Ebert calls the \"poised and imperious Miranda\", drew rave reviews from critics, and earned her many award nominations, including her record-setting 14th Oscar bid, as well as another Golden Globe. On its commercial release, the film became Streep's biggest commercial success to this point, grossing more than US$326.5 million worldwide.\nShe portrayed a wealthy university patron in Chen Shi-zheng's much-delayed feature drama \"Dark Matter\", a film about a Chinese science graduate student who becomes violent after dealing with academic politics at a U.S. university. Inspired by the events of the 1991 University of Iowa shooting, and initially scheduled for a 2007 release, producers and investors decided to shelve \"Dark Matter\" out of respect for the victims of the Virginia Tech shooting in April 2007. The drama received negative to mixed reviews upon its limited 2008 release. Streep played a U.S. government official who investigates an Egyptian foreign national suspected of terrorism in the political thriller \"Rendition\" (2007), directed by Gavin Hood. Keen to get involved in a thriller film, Streep welcomed the opportunity to star in a film genre for which she was not usually offered scripts, and immediately signed on to the project. Upon its release, \"Rendition\" was less commercially successful, and received mixed reviews.\nIn this period, Streep had a short role alongside Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close, and her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer in Lajos Koltai's drama film \"Evening\" (2007), based on the 1998 novel of the same name by Susan Minot. Switching between the present and the past, it tells the story of a bedridden woman, who remembers her tumultuous life in the mid-1950s. The film was released to a lukewarm reaction from critics, who called it \"beautifully filmed, but decidedly dull [and] a colossal waste of a talented cast\". She had a role in Robert Redford's \"Lions for Lambs\" (also 2007), a film about the connection between a platoon of United States soldiers in Afghanistan, a U.S. senator, a reporter, and a California college professor. Like \"Evening\", critics felt that the talent of the cast was wasted, and that it suffered from slow pacing, although one critic announced that Streep positively stood out, being \"natural, unforced, quietly powerful\", in comparison to Redford's forced performance.\nStreep found major commercial success when she starred in Phyllida Lloyd's \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008), a film adaptation of the musical of the same name, based on the songs of Swedish pop group ABBA. Co-starring Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, and Christine Baranski, Streep played a single mother and a former girl-group singer, whose daughter (Seyfried), a bride-to-be who never met her father, invites three likely paternal candidates to her wedding on the idyllic Greek island of Skopelos known in the film as Kalokairi. An instant box office success, \"Mamma Mia!\" became Streep's highest-grossing film to date, with box office receipts of US$602.6 million, also ranking it first among the highest-grossing musical films. Nominated for another Golden Globe, Streep's performance was generally well received by critics, with Wesley Morris of \"The Boston Globe\" commenting: \"The greatest actor in American movies has finally become a movie star.\"\n\"Doubt\" (also 2008) features Streep with Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams, and Viola Davis. A drama revolving around the stern principal nun (Streep) of a Bronx Catholic school in 1964 who brings accusations of pedophilia against a popular priest (Hoffman), the film became a moderate box office success, and was hailed by many critics as one of the best films of 2008. The film received five Academy Awards nominations, for its four lead actors and for John Patrick Shanley's script. Ebert, who awarded the film the full four stars, highlighted Streep's caricature of a nun, who \"hates all inroads of the modern world\", while Kelly Vance of \"The East Bay Express\" remarked: \"It's thrilling to see a pro like Streep step into an already wildly exaggerated role, and then ramp it up a few notches just for the sheer hell of it. Grim, red-eyed, deathly pale Sister Aloysius may be the scariest nun of all time.\"\nIn 2009, Streep played chef Julia Child in Nora Ephron's \"Julie &amp; Julia\", co-starring with Stanley Tucci, and again with Amy Adams. (Tucci and Streep had worked together earlier in \"Devil Wears Prada\".) The first major motion picture based on a blog, \"Julie and Julia\" contrasts the life of Child in the early years of her culinary career with the life of young New Yorker Julie Powell (Adams), who aspires to cook all 524 recipes in Child's cookbook \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\". Longworth believes her caricature of Julia Child was \"quite possibly the biggest performance of her career, while also drawing on her own experience to bring lived-in truth to the story of a late bloomer\". In Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy \"It's Complicated\" (also 2009), Streep starred with Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin. She received nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for both \"Julie &amp; Julia\" and \"It's Complicated\"; she won the award for \"Julie &amp; Julia\", and later received her 16th Oscar nomination for it. She also lent her voice to Mrs. Felicity Fox in Wes Anderson's stop-motion film \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\".\n2010s: Further critical and commercial success.\nStreep re-teamed with \"Mamma Mia\" director Phyllida Lloyd on \"The Iron Lady\" (2011), a British biographical film about Margaret Thatcher, which takes a look at the Prime Minister during the Falklands War and her years in retirement. Streep, who attended a session of the House of Commons to see British Members of Parliament (MPs) in action in preparation for her role as Thatcher, called her casting \"a daunting and exciting challenge\". While the film had a mixed reception, Streep's performance gained rave reviews, earning her Best Actress awards at the Golden Globes and the BAFTAs, as well as her third win at the 84th Academy Awards. Former advisers, friends, and family of Thatcher criticized Streep's portrayal of her as \"inaccurate\" and \"biased\". The following year, after Thatcher's death, Streep issued a formal statement describing Thatcher's \"hard-nosed fiscal measures\" and \"hands-off approach to financial regulation\", while praising her \"personal strength and grit\".\nStreep re-united with \"Prada\" director David Frankel on the set of the romantic comedy-drama film \"Hope Springs\" (2012), co-starring Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carell. Streep and Jones play a middle-aged couple, who attend a week of intensive marriage counseling to try to bring back the intimacy missing in their relationship. Reviews for the film were mostly positive, with critics praising the \"mesmerizing performances ... which offer filmgoers some grown-up laughs \u2013 and a thoughtful look at mature relationships\". In 2013, Streep starred alongside Julia Roberts and Ewan McGregor in the black comedy drama \"\" (2013) about a dysfunctional family that re-unites into the familial house when their patriarch suddenly disappears. Based on Tracy Letts's Pulitzer Prize-winning , Streep received positive reviews for her portrayal of the family's strong-willed and contentious matriarch, who is suffering from oral cancer and an addiction to narcotics. She was subsequently nominated for another Golden Globe, SAG, and Academy Award.\nIn 2014's \"The Giver\", a motion picture adaptation of the young adult novel, Streep played a community leader. Set in 2048, the social science fiction film recounts the story of a post-apocalyptic community without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, where a young boy is chosen to learn the real world. Streep was aware of the book before being offered the role by co-star and producer Jeff Bridges. Upon its release, \"The Giver\" was met with generally mixed to negative reviews from critics. Streep also had a small role in the period drama film \"The Homesman\" (2014). Set in the 1850s midwest, the film stars Hilary Swank and Tommy Lee Jones as an unusual pair who help three women driven to madness by the frontier to get back East. Streep does not appear until near the end of the film, playing a preacher's wife, who takes the women into care. \"The Homesman\" premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival where it garnered largely positive reviews from critics.\nDirected by Rob Marshall, \"Into the Woods\" (also 2014) is a Disney film adaptation of the Broadway musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim in which Streep plays a witch. A fantasy genre crossover inspired by the Grimm Brothers' fairy tales, it centers on a childless couple who set out to end a curse placed on them by Streep's vengeful witch. Though the film was dismissed by some critics such as Mark Kermode as \"irritating naffness\", Streep's performance earned her Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and Critic's Choice Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress. In July 2014, it was announced that Streep would portray Maria Callas in \"Master Class\", but the project was pulled after director Mike Nichols's death in November of the same year.\nIn 2015, Streep starred in Jonathan Demme's \"Ricki and the Flash\", playing a grocery store checkout worker by day who is a rock musician at night, and who has one last chance to reconnect with her estranged family. Streep learned to play the guitar for the semi-autobiographical drama-comedy film, which again featured Streep with her eldest daughter Mamie Gummer. Reviews of the film were generally mixed. Streep's other film of this time was director Sarah Gavron's period drama \"Suffragette\" (also 2015), co-starring Carey Mulligan and Helena Bonham Carter. In the film, she played the small, but pivotal, role of Emmeline Pankhurst, a British political activist and leader of the British suffragette movement who helped women win the right to vote. The film received mostly positive reviews, particularly for the performances of the cast, though its distributor earned criticism that Streep's prominent position within the marketing was misleading.\nFollowing the duties of the president at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival in 2016, Streep starred in the Stephen Frears-directed comedy \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" (2016), an eponymous biopic about a blithely unaware tone-deaf opera singer who insists upon public performance. Other cast members were Hugh Grant and Simon Helberg. Robbie Collin considered it to be one of her most \"human performance\" and felt that it was \"full of warmth that gives way to heart-pinching pathos\". She won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in a Comedy, and received Academy Award, Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA nominations.\nStreep next starred as the first American female newspaper publisher, Katharine Graham, to Tom Hanks' Ben Bradlee, in Steven Spielberg's political drama \"The Post\" (2017), which centers on \"The Washington Post\"'s publication of the 1971 Pentagon Papers. The film received positive reviews with praise directed to the performances of the two leads. Manohla Dargis wrote that \"Streep creates an acutely moving portrait of a woman who in liberating herself helps instigate a revolution\". It earned over $177 million against a budget of $50 million. Streep received her 31st Golden Globe nomination and 21st Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.\nIn 2018, Streep briefly reprised her role in the musical sequel \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again\". She also played a supporting part in Rob Marshall's \"Mary Poppins Returns\", a musical sequel to the 1964 film \"Mary Poppins\" starring Emily Blunt in the titular role. Streep next featured in her first main role in a television series by starring in the second season of the HBO drama series \"Big Little Lies\" in 2019. She took on the part of Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Nicole Kidman's character. Liane Moriarty, author of the novel of the same name, on which the first season is based, wrote a 200-page novella that served as the basis for the second season. Moriarty decided to name the new character Mary Louise, after Streep's legal name. Streep subsequently agreed to the part without reading a script for the first time in her career. Writing for the BBC, Caryn James labeled her performance \"delicious and wily\" and found her to be the \"embodiment of a passive-aggressive granny\". She received an Emmy nomination for the show. The same year, Streep then starred in the Steven Soderbergh-directed biographical comedy \"The Laundromat\", about the Panama Papers, opposite Gary Oldman and Antonio Banderas. It was the first movie distributed by Netflix in which Streep starred. She also played Aunt March in Greta Gerwig's \"Little Women\", co-starring with Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Florence Pugh, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, and Laura Dern. \nDavid Rooney of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" praised Streep's performance writing, \"Streep is clearly having a ball as the imperious snob who snorts with disapproval...[and] does her best to hide her affection for her nieces behind her narrowed gaze and all-purpose disdain\". The film received critical acclaim and grossed over $218 million against its $40 million budget.\n2020s: Streaming and theatrical projects.\nIn 2020, she voiced a role in the Apple TV+ animated short film \"Here We Are: Notes for Living on Planet Earth\". Streep had leading roles in two films, both released by streaming services. She reunited with Nicole Kidman for Netflix, in Ryan Murphy's \"The Prom\" (2020), a film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. That same year she also reunited with director Steven Soderbergh for his HBO Max comedy film \"Let Them All Talk\" (2020). Streep starred alongside Dianne Wiest, Candice Bergen, Lucas Hedges, and Gemma Chan. Richard Lawson of \"Vanity Fair\" noted, \"Streep could, in some senses, be approaching the film as a meta commentary on her own ivied stature as the world's greatest living actor (in some people's estimation, anyway). If that is what's happening, she never betrays her motivations with a wink. It's all played pretty earnestly\".\nStreep then starred opposite Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence in \"Don't Look Up\" (2021), directed by Adam McKay for Netflix. Streep played a comical role as the fictional President of the United States who waves off the fears of climate change. In his mixed review, Peter DeBruge of \"Variety\" stated she was \"clearly having more fun than we are\". Streep served as an executive producer on \"Sell/Buy/Date\" (2022), directed by Sarah Jones. She acted in the Apple TV+ anthology series \"Extrapolations\" (2023). Later that year, she began playing Loretta Durkin, a struggling actress, from the third season of the Hulu comedy series \"Only Murders in the Building\", starring Steve Martin, Martin Short and Selena Gomez. Leila Latif of \"The Guardian\" wrote, \"Streep, unsurprisingly, plays Loretta beautifully, truly tapping into the agony of a woman who's faced a lifetime of rejection but somehow kept her dream alive\". She received a Golden Globe, and Primetime Emmy Award nomination and won a Critics' Choice Television Award.\nIn 2025, Streep attended the \"Saturday Night Live 50th Anniversary Special\", in which she acted in an alien abduction skit portraying the mother of Colleen Rafferty, played by Kate McKinnon. It marked Streep's first \"SNL\" appearance. She is set to reprise the role of Miranda Priestly in \"The Devil Wears Prada 2\", which is scheduled for release in May 2026.\nOn August 18, 2025 it was announced that a biopic on the life and career of musician Joni Mitchell was in the works with Cameron Crowe set to direct the film. Streep has signed on to play Mitchell in present day with Anya Taylor-Joy playing Mitchell in the 1960s and 1970s.\nOther ventures.\nAfter Streep starred in \"Mamma Mia!\", her rendition of the titular song rose to popularity on the Portuguese music charts, where it peaked at number eight in October 2008. At the 35th People's Choice Awards, her version of \"Mamma Mia\" won an award for \"Favorite Song From A Soundtrack\". In 2008, Streep was nominated for a Grammy Award (her fifth nomination) for her work on the \"Mamma Mia!\" soundtrack. Streep has narrated numerous audio books, including three by children's book author William Steig: \"Brae Irene\", \"Spinky Sulks\", and \"The One and Only Shrek!\".\nStreep is the spokesperson for the National Women's History Museum, to which she has made significant donations (including her fee for \"The Iron Lady, \"which was $1 million), and hosted numerous events. On October 4, 2012, Streep donated $1 million to The Public Theater in honor of both its late founder, Joseph Papp, and her friend, the author Nora Ephron. She also supports Gucci's \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to spread female empowerment.\nIn 2014, Streep established two scholarships for students at the University of Massachusetts Lowell \u2013 the Meryl Streep Endowed Scholarship for English majors, and the Joan Hertzberg Endowed Scholarship (named for Streep's former classmate at Vassar College) for math majors.\nIn April 2015, it was announced that Streep had funded a screenwriters lab for female screenwriters over forty years old, called the Writers Lab, to be run by New York Women in Film &amp; Television and the collective IRIS. The Lab was the only one of its kind in the world for female screenwriters over forty years old. In 2015, Streep signed an open letter for which One Campaign had been collecting signatures; the letter was addressed to Angela Merkel and Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, urging them to focus on women as they served as heads of the G7 in Germany and the AU in South Africa, respectively, in setting development funding priorities. Also in 2015, Streep sent each member of the U.S. Congress a letter supporting the Equal Rights Amendment. Each of her letters was sent with a copy of the book \"Equal Means Equal: Why the Time for the ERA is Now\" by Jessica Neuwirth, president of the ERA Coalition.\nWhen asked in a 2015 interview with \"Time Out\" if she was a feminist, Streep replied, \"I am a humanist, I am for nice easy balance.\" In March 2016, Streep, among others, signed a letter asking for gender equality throughout the world, in observance of International Women's Day; this was also organized by One Campaign. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.\nOn April 25, 2017, Streep publicly backed the campaign to free Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker from Crimea who was subjected to a sham trial by Russia and jailed in Siberia for 20 years in August 2015. She was pictured alongside Ukrainian lawmaker Mustafa Nayyem with a \"Free Sentsov\" sign in a photograph taken during the PEN America Annual Literary Gala on April 25, at which Sentsov was honoured with a 2017 PEN/Barbey Freedom to Write award.\nReception and legacy.\nIn 2004, Streep was awarded the AFI Life Achievement Award by the board of directors of the American Film Institute. In 2011, she received a Kennedy Center Honors, introduced by Tracey Ullman, and speeches by 2009 Kennedy Center Honoree Robert De Niro and 2003 Kennedy Center Honoree Mike Nichols. Those also to honor Streep included, Kevin Kline, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, and Anne Hathaway. The tribute ended with the whole cast who sang \"She's My Pal\", a play on \"He's My Pal\" from \"Ironweed\".\nIn November 2014, President Barack Obama bestowed upon Streep the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. The citation reads as follows, \"Meryl Streep is one of the most widely known and acclaimed actors in history. Ms. Streep has captured our imaginations with her unparalleled ability to portray a wide range of roles and attract an audience that has only grown over time, portraying characters who embody the full range of the human experience.\" In January 2017, Viola Davis presented Streep with the Cecil B. DeMille at the Golden Globes. Davis stated to Streep \"You make me proud to be an artist\". In her acceptance speech, Streep quoted the recently departed Carrie Fisher, saying, \"Take your broken heart and make it into art.\"\n\"Vanity Fair\" commented that \"it's hard to imagine that there was a time before Meryl Streep was the greatest-living actress\". Emma Brockes of \"The Guardian\" notes that despite Streep's being \"one of the most famous actresses in the world\", it is \"strangely hard to pin an image on Streep\", in a career where she has \"laboured to establish herself as an actor whose roots lie in ordinary life\". Despite her success, Streep has always been modest about her own acting and achievements in cinema. She has stated that she has no particular method when it comes to acting, learning from the days of her early studies that she cannot articulate her practice. She said in 1987, \"I have a smattering of things I've learned from different teachers, but nothing I can put into a valise and open it up and say 'Now, which one would you like?' Nothing I can count on, and that makes it more dangerous. But then, the danger makes it more exciting.\" She has stated that her ideal director is one who gives her complete artistic control, allowing her to have a degree of improvisation and to learn from her mistakes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWomen are better at acting than men. Why? Because we have to be. If successfully convincing somebody bigger than you of something he doesn't know is a survival skill, this is how women have survived through the millennia. Pretending is not just play. Pretending is imagined possibility. Pretending or acting is a very valuable life skill, and we all do it. All the time.\n\u2014 Streep on acting\nKarina Longworth notes how \"external\" Streep's performances are, \"chameleonic\" in her impersonation of characters, \"subsuming herself into them, rather than personifying them\". In her early roles such as \"Manhattan\" and \"Kramer vs. Kramer\", she was compared to both Diane Keaton and Jill Clayburgh, in that her characters were unsympathetic, which Streep has attributed to the tendency to be drawn to playing women who are difficult to like and lack empathy. Streep has stated that many consider her to be a technical actor, but she professed that it comes down to her love of reading the initial script, adding, \"I come ready and I don't want to screw around and waste the first 10 takes on adjusting lighting and everybody else getting comfortable\".\nMike Nichols, who directed Streep in \"Silkwood\", \"Heartburn\", \"Postcards from the Edge\", and \"Angels in America\", praised Streep's ability to transform herself into her characters, remarking that, \"In every role, she becomes a totally new human being. As she becomes the person she is portraying, the other performers begin to react to her as if she were that person.\" He said that directing her is \"so much like falling in love that it has the characteristics of a time which you remember as magical, but which is shrouded in mystery\". He also noted that Streep's acting ability had a profound impact on her co-stars, and that \"one could improve by 1000% purely by watching her\". Longworth believes that in nearly every film, Streep has \"sly infused\" a feminist point of view in her portrayals. However, film critic Molly Haskell has stated, \"None of her heroines are feminist, strictly speaking. Yet, they uncannily embody various crosscurrents of experience in the last twenty years, as women have re-defined themselves against the background of the women's movement\".\nStreep is well known for her ability to imitate a wide range of accents \u2013 from Danish in \"Out of Africa\" (1985) to British Received Pronunciation in \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981), \"Plenty\" (1985), and \"The Iron Lady\" (2011); Italian in \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995); a southern American accent in \"The Seduction of Joe Tynan\" (1979); a Minnesota accent in \"A Prairie Home Companion\" (2006); Upstate New York in \"Ironweed\" (1987); and a heavy Bronx accent in \"Doubt\" (2008). Streep has stated that she grew up listening to artists such as Barbra Streisand, the Beatles, and Bob Dylan, and she learned a lot about how to use her voice, her \"instrument\", by listening to Barbra Streisand's albums. In the film \"Evil Angels\" (1988, released in the U.S. as \"A Cry in the Dark\"), in which she portrays a New Zealand transplant to Australia, Streep developed a hybrid of Australian and New Zealand English. Her performance received the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role, as well as Best Actress at the Cannes Film Festival, and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\nFor her role in the film \"Sophie's Choice\" (1982), Streep spoke both English and German with a Polish accent, as well as Polish itself. In \"The Iron Lady\", she reproduced the vocal style of Margaret Thatcher from the time before Thatcher became Britain's Prime Minister, and after she had taken elocution lessons to change her pitch, pronunciation, and delivery. Streep has commented that using accents as part of her acting is a technique she views as an obvious requirement in her portrayal of a character.\nWhen questioned in Belfast as to how she reproduces different accents, Streep replied in a reportedly \"perfect\" Belfast accent: \"I listen.\"\nActivism and advocacy.\nPolitically, Streep has described herself as part of the American Left. She gave a speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in support of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In January 2017, Streep was honored with the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement at the 74th Golden Globe Awards, during which she delivered a predominantly political speech that implicitly criticized President-elect Donald Trump. She argued that Trump had a very strong platform and used it inappropriately to mock a disabled reporter, Serge F. Kovaleski, whom, in her words, Trump \"outranked in privilege, power, and the capacity to fight back\". Trump responded by calling Streep \"one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood\", and \"a Hillary flunky who lost big\".\nWhile promoting \"Suffragette\" in 2015, Streep accused the review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes of disproportionately representing the opinions of male film critics, resulting in a skewed ratio that adversely affected the commercial performances of female-driven films. In June 2023, Streep was reported as one of many A-List members of the SAG-AFTRA who signed a letter threatening to strike.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships and family.\nAuthor Karina Longworth notes that despite her stardom, for decades Streep has managed to maintain a relatively normal personal life. Streep lived with actor John Cazale in the 1970s, caring for him after his lung cancer diagnosis until he died in March 1978. Streep said of his death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I didn't get over it. I don't want to get over it. No matter what you do, the pain is always there in some recess of your mind, and it affects everything that happens afterwards. I think you can assimilate the pain and go on without making an obsession of it.\nStreep married sculptor Don Gummer six months after Cazale's death. They have four children: musician Henry Wolfe Gummer (born 1979), and actresses Mary Willa \"Mamie\" Gummer (born 1983), Grace Jane Gummer (born 1986), and Louisa Jacobson Gummer (born 1991). In 1985, the family moved into a $1.8-million private estate in Connecticut and lived there until they bought a $3-million mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, in 1990. They later moved back to Connecticut. In 2023, it was reported that Streep and Gummer had been separated for more than six years. They were publicly last seen together at the 90th Academy Awards in 2018. \nStreep is the godmother of Billie Lourd, daughter of fellow actress and close friend Carrie Fisher. Fisher wrote the screenplay for Streep's 1990 film \"Postcards from the Edge,\" based on Fisher's book.\nBeliefs.\nWhen asked if religion plays a part in her life in 2009, Streep replied: \"I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram.\" In an interview in December 2008, she alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: So, I've always been really, deeply interested because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe in the power of prayer, or things would have been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So, it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there.\nWhen asked where she draws consolation in the face of aging and death, Streep responded: Consolation? I'm not sure I have it. I have a belief, I guess, in the power of the aggregate human attempt \u2013 the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism \u2013 you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?\nActing credits and awards.\nOne of the most prolific actresses of screen and stage since her career's inception in the late 1970s, Streep's most acclaimed and highest-grossing films, according to the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, include \"Julia\" (1977), \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978), \"Kramer vs. Kramer\" (1979), \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" (1981), \"Sophie's Choice\" (1982), \"Silkwood\" (1983), \"A Cry in the Dark\" (1988), \"Postcards from the Edge\" (1990), \"Defending Your Life\" (1991), \"The Bridges of Madison County\" (1995), \"Marvin's Room\" (1996), \"Adaptation\" (2002), \"The Devil Wears Prada\" (2007), \"Mamma Mia\" (2008), \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" (2009), \"The Homesman\" (2014), \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" (2016), \"Little Women\" (2019), and \"Let Them All Talk\" (2020).

Her stage roles include the Broadway theatre productions \"A Memory of Two Mondays\", \"27 Wagons Full of Cotton\" (both 1976) and \"The Cherry Orchard\" (1977), as well as multiple plays at the Delacorte Theater.\nStreep has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the following performances:\nThese nominations make Streep the most Academy Award-nominated performer in history, with 21 in total (17 for Best Actress and four for Best Supporting Actress), as well as one of only 13 performers to win an Oscar in both acting categories and one of only three performers to win three Academy Awards across the two acting categories (with Ingrid Bergman and Jack Nicholson being the only others to achieve this feat).\nShe has also received six Grammy Award nominations, six Primetime Emmy Award nominations (with three wins plus a Children's and Family Emmy Award win), and one Tony Award nomination. Streep is one of few performers to be nominated for the Triple Crown of Acting and EGOT. Her other accolades include two BAFTA Awards for Best Actress in a Leading Role (for \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\" and \"The Iron Lady\"), nine Golden Globe Awards (as well as the honorary Cecil B. DeMille Award), a Silver Bear and Honorary Golden Bear in Berlin International Film Festival, Best Actress, Honorary Palme d'Or in Cannes Film Festival and two Screen Actors Guild Awards.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "63392", "revid": "715696", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63392", "title": "Consensus reality", "text": "Notion of reality based on consensus view\nConsensus reality is the generally agreed-upon version of reality within a community or society, shaped by shared experiences and understandings. This understanding arises from the inherent differences in individual perspectives or subjectivities relating to knowledge or ontology, leading to uncertainties about what is real. While various viewpoints exist, people strive to establish a consensus, serving as a pragmatic guide for social norms. The term carries both positive and negative connotations, as it is viewed critically by anti-realist theorists but recognized for its practical benefits in fostering shared beliefs. Consensus reality differs from consensual reality, with the former representing mutual agreement about what is true. Artists and thinkers have challenged consensus reality, aiming to disrupt established norms and question the authenticity of the world's reality.\nChildren have sometimes been described or viewed as \"inexperience[d] with consensus reality,\" though are described as such with the expectation that their perspective will progressively form closer to the consensus reality of their society as they age.\nGeneral discussion.\nIn considering the nature of reality, two broad approaches exist: the realist approach, in which there is a single, objective, overall reality believed to exist irrespective of the perceptions of any given individual, and the idealistic approach, in which it is considered that an individual can verify nothing except their own \"experience\" of the world, and can never directly know the truth of the world independent of that.\nBerger and Luckmann argue that \"reality is socially constructed and that the sociology of knowledge must analyze the process in which this occurs\". Rather than being a purely philosophical topic, the question of reality includes, for them, the sociological study of consensus reality.\nConsider this example: consensus reality for people who follow a particular theocentric religion is different from consensus reality for those who follow another theocentric religion, or from those that eschew theocentric religions in favor of science alone, for explaining life and the universe.\nIn societies where theocentric religions are dominant, the religious understanding of existence would be the consensus reality. In a predominantly secular society, where the consensus reality is grounded in science alone, the religious worldview would be the non-consensus (or alternative) reality.\nIn this way, different individuals and communities have fundamentally different world views, with fundamentally different comprehensions of the world around them, and of the constructs within which they live. Thus, a society that is, for example, completely secular and one which believes every eventuality to be subject to metaphysical influence will have very different consensus realities, and many of their beliefs on broad issues such as science, slavery, and human sacrifice may differ in direct consequence of the differences in the perceived nature of the world they live in.\nCharles Tart in his book \"The Awakening\" proposed an alternative term - \"conditioned reality\" (\"conditioned\" or \"conditional reality\"), pointing out the inaccuracy of the term \"consensus reality\", since no one asks an individual for consent whether he wants to live in a \"generally accepted reality\", because he is accustomed to it through \"conditioning\" - the development of conditioned reflexes in the process of education and socialization.\nIn science and philosophy.\nIdealists.\nSome idealists (subjective idealists) hold the view that there isn't one particular way things are, but rather that each person's personal reality is unique. Such idealists have the world view which says that we each create our own reality, and while most people may be in general agreement (consensus) about what reality is like, they might live in a different (or nonconsensus) reality.\nMaterialists.\nMaterialists may not accept the idea of there being different possible realities for different people, rather than different beliefs about one reality. So for them only the first usage of the term reality would make sense. To them, someone believing otherwise, where the facts have been properly established, might be considered delusional.\nSocial consequences.\nViews on the term.\nThe connotation of the term \"consensus reality\" is usually disparaging: it is usually employed by idealist, surrealist and other anti-realist theorists opposing or hostile to this \"reality,\" with the implication that this consensus reality is, to a greater or lesser extent, created by those who experience it. (The phrase \"consensus reality\" may be used more loosely to refer to any generally accepted set of beliefs.) However, there are those who use the term approvingly for the practical benefits of all agreeing on a common set of assumptions or experiences.\nConsensus vs. consensual reality.\nConsensus reality is related to, but distinct from, consensual reality. The difference between these terms is that whereas consensus reality describes a state of mutual agreement about what is true (consensus is a noun), consensual reality describes a type of agreement about what is true (consensual is an adjective). In other words, reality may also be non-consensual, as when one person's preferred version of reality conflicts with another person's preferred version of reality. Consensual reality is relevant to understanding a variety of social phenomena, such as deception. \nSocial aspects.\nArtists, writers, and theorists have attempted to oppose or undermine consensus reality while others have declared that they are \"ignoring\" it. For example, Salvador Dal\u00ed intended by his paranoiac-critical method to \"systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Quotations related to at Wikiquote"}

He was also the last governor of the Spanish Netherlands and Duke of Luxembourg. An able soldier, his ambition led to conflicts that limited his ultimate dynastic achievements.\nHe was born in Munich to Ferdinand Maria, Elector of Bavaria and Princess Henriette Adelaide of Savoy.\nWar against the Ottoman Empire.\nMaximilian inherited the elector's mantle while still a minor in 1679 and remained under his uncle Maximilian Philipp's regency until 1680. By 1683 he was already embarked on a military career, fighting in the defence of Vienna against the attempt of the Ottoman Empire to extend their possessions further into Europe. He returned to court for long enough to marry Maria Antonia, daughter of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor and Margaret Theresa of Spain, on 15 July 1685 in Vienna, Austria. This marriage was very unhappy since the couple disliked each other, but it was successful in producing the desired heir for both Bavaria and the Spanish monarchy. Maximilian Emanuel's fame was assured when, in 1688, he led the capture of Belgrade from the Turks, with the full support of Serbian insurgents under the command of Jovan Monasterlija.\nGovernor of the Spanish Netherlands.\nIn the War of the Grand Alliance he again fought on the Habsburgs' side, protecting the Rhine frontier, and, being the Emperor's son-in-law and the husband of the King of Spain's niece, was appointed governor of the Spanish Netherlands in late 1691.\nHis Netherlands adventure catalyzed Maximilian Emanuel's dynastic ambitions. One year after his appointment as governor, Maria Antonia died in Vienna, having given birth to a son, Joseph Ferdinand, who was appointed heir to the Spanish monarchy but died in 1699 before acceding the throne. An alternative avenue for Maximilian Emanuel's ambition was offered by his marriage on 12 January 1694 to Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, the death of whose father, the elected King of Poland John III Sobieski, two years later, offered a potential avenue of influence in Polish affairs. Maximilian II was a candidate in the 1697 Polish\u2013Lithuanian royal election, however, in view of the lack of strong support from other powers, the limited royal authority by the Sejm of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, and his greater interest in assuming the Spanish throne, he did not make a serious effort for the Polish crown.\nHowever, he concentrated his interests in Western Europe, making his sons by Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska, Charles Albert and Clemens August, the principal beneficiaries of his ambitions.\nThe unsuccessful siege and bombardment of Brussels in 1695 during the Nine Years' War by French troops and the resulting fire during Max Emanuel's rule were together the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels.\nWar of the Spanish Succession.\nMaximilian Emanuel, who had married Archduchess Maria Antonia, the sole child of Emperor Leopold's Spanish marriage, was one of the more serious claimants to the Spanish inheritance of Charles II of Spain, and the birth of his son Joseph Ferdinand in October 1692 immediately created a new claimant to the Spanish throne. In October 1698, William III of England and Louis XIV of France concluded the First Partition Treaty, which gave the Spanish crown with the Indies to Joseph Ferdinand, the Duchy of Milan to Emperor Leopold's younger son Archduke Charles, and the rest of Spanish Italy to France. The unexpected death of Joseph Ferdinand four months later voided this plan and in the Second Partition Treaty, the Bavarian portion of the inheritance was allotted to Archduke Charles. By the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1701, Maximilian Emanuel, who had long-term imperial aspirations, had hoped that his governorship of the Spanish Netherlands might yet reap the reward of a share of the Spanish inheritance from either Leopold or, failing him, Louis XIV. Allying himself with the French against Austria, his campaign against Tyrol in 1703 did not have success and his plans were then frustrated by the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Blenheim in 1704.\nIn 1704\u201305, following the evacuation of the Bavarian court to the Spanish Netherlands after the defeat at the Battle of Blenheim, Max Emanuel's consort apparently was in charge of the government in the Stewardship of Munich of the Electorate of Bavaria as Regent Princess. However, when Theresa Kunegunda had found love letters of the Countess of Arco, a mistress of Max Emanuel, she left Munich to see her mother in Venice. The army would not allow her to return. In the ensuing evacuation of his court to the Netherlands, Maximilian Emanuel's family became separated and his sons were held prisoners for several years in Austria, Clemens August being brought up by Jesuits. Bavaria was partitioned between Austria and Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine. The harsh Austrian administration which managed to extract massive amounts of money and manpower from Bavaria led to a serious peasant uprising within a year.\nMaximilian Emanuel was again forced to flee the Netherlands after the Battle of Ramillies on 23 May 1706 and found refuge at the French court in Versailles where his late sister Maria Anna (1660\u20131690) had been the \"Dauphine of France\". In 1712, Luxemburg and Namur were ceded to Maximilian Emanuel by his French allies, a cession that was not definitive since France was only the occupant of what was still the Spanish Netherlands. The war between France and Austria finally ended in 1714 in the Treaty of Rastatt in which Louis XIV compelled Austria to implement the full restoration of his faithful ally Maximilian Emanuel, including the return of the Upper Palatinate. Maximilian Emanuel was to remain in possession of Luxemburg, Namur and Charleroi until he was restored.\nFinal years in Bavaria.\nBack in Bavaria, Maximilian Emanuel focused on architecture projects to balance the failure of his political ambitions. It was bitter for him to witness the royal elevation of the German princes Augustus II the Strong (1697), Frederick I of Prussia (1701) and George I of Hanover (1714) as well as of his cousin Victor Amadeus of Sicily (1713) while his own political dreams could not be realized.\nMaximilian Emanuel then supported the Habsburgs in a new war against the Turks, contributing troops to the Army of the Holy Roman Empire in (1717).\nIn 1724, he created a union of all lines of the Wittelsbach dynasty to increase the influence of his house. The Wittelsbach prince-electors Max Emanuel, his son Clemens August of Cologne, Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine and Franz Ludwig of Trier had at that time four votes at their disposal for the next imperial election. The crown of the Holy Roman Empire was sought for either Max Emanuel or his son Charles Albert. Already in 1722 Charles Albert had been married to the Habsburg Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria.\nIn 1726, Max Emanuel died of a stroke. He is buried in the crypt of the Theatinerkirche in Munich.\nCultural legacy.\nDuring his entire reign Maximilian II Emanuel patronized the arts. As governor of the Spanish Netherlands he acquired numerous Dutch and Flemish paintings for the Wittelsbach collection.\nThe first half of Max Emanuel's reign was still dominated by his parents' Italian court artists, like Enrico Zuccalli and Giovanni Antonio Viscardi. Between 1684 and 1688, Zuccalli built the Italian style Lustheim Palace for Max Emanuel and his first wife Maria Antonia, located on a central island. With the appointment of Joseph Effner serving as chief architect of the court and the young Fran\u00e7ois de Cuvilli\u00e9s as his assistant, the French influence significantly increased and Max Emanuel's return in 1715 marked the origin of the era of Bavarian Rococo.\nThe Nymphenburg Palace was enlarged, the Dachau Palace redesigned, and the new Schleissheim Palace was finally completed (1726) during Max Emanuel's reign. These palaces were connected with a network of canals as Max Emanuel had become acquainted with in the Netherlands. Between 1715 and 1717, he had the Baroque style F\u00fcrstenried Palace built by Effner as a hunting lodge which was the extension and modification of an already existing noble mansion.\nMarriages and issue.\n First marriage with Maria Antonia of Austria, daughter of Emperor Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor:\nSecond marriage with Theresa Kunegunda Sobieska of Poland, daughter of King John III Sobieski:\nHe had an illegitimate child with his French mistress Agnes Fran\u00e7oise Louchier;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63394", "revid": "134766", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63394", "title": "Bacon", "text": "Type of salt-cured pork\nBacon is a type of salt-cured pork made from various cuts, typically the belly or less fatty parts of the back. It is eaten as a side dish (particularly in breakfasts), used as a central ingredient (e.g., the BLT sandwich), or as a flavouring or accent.\nBacon is also used for barding and larding roasts, especially game, including venison and pheasant, and may also be used to insulate or flavour roast joints by being layered onto the meat. The word is derived from the Proto-Germanic , meaning 'back meat'. \nMeat from other animals, such as beef, lamb, chicken, goat, or turkey, may also be cut, cured, or otherwise prepared to resemble bacon, and may even be referred to as, for example, \"turkey bacon\". Such use is common in areas with significant Jewish and Muslim populations as both religions prohibit the consumption of pork. Vegetarian bacons such as \"soy bacon\" also exist.\nCuring and smoking.\nBefore the advent of cheap and widespread artificial refrigeration in the modern era, the curing of meat was necessary for its safe long-term preservation. However, both the flavour imparted to the meat in doing so and the extended shelf life it offered had become much prized, and although curing is in general no longer necessary in the developed world, it continues in wide use.\nBacon is cured through either a process of injecting it with or soaking it in brine, known as wet curing, or rubbed with salt, known as dry curing. Bacon brine has added curing ingredients, most notably nitrites or nitrates, which speed the curing and stabilise colour. Cured bacon may then be dried for weeks or months in cold air, or it may be smoked or boiled. Fresh and dried bacon are typically cooked before eating, often by pan frying. Boiled bacon is ready-to-eat, as is some smoked bacon, but they may be cooked further before eating. Differing flavours can be achieved by using various types of wood, or less common fuels such as corn cobs or peat. This process can take up to eighteen hours, depending on the intensity of the flavour desired. \"The Virginia Housewife\" (1824), thought to be one of the earliest American cookbooks, gives no indication that bacon is ever \"not\" smoked, though it gives no advice on flavouring, noting only that care should be taken lest the fire get too hot.\nBacon is distinguished from other salt-cured pork by differences in the cuts of meat used and in the brine or dry packing. Historically, the terms \"ham\" and \"bacon\" referred to different cuts of meat that were brined or packed identically, often together in the same barrel. Today, ham is defined as coming from the hind portion of the pig and brine specifically for curing ham includes a greater amount of sugar, while bacon is less sweet, though ingredients such as brown sugar or maple syrup are used for flavour. Bacon is similar to salt pork, which in modern times is often prepared from similar cuts, but salt pork is never smoked, and has a much higher salt content.\nFor safety, bacon may be treated to prevent trichinosis, caused by \"Trichinella\", a parasitic roundworm which can be destroyed by heating, freezing, drying, or smoking. Sodium polyphosphates, such as sodium triphosphate, may also be added to make the product easier to slice and to reduce spattering when the bacon is pan-fried.\nCuts.\nBacon type differs depending on the primal cut of pork from which it is prepared, which reflects local preference.\nThe inclusion of skin with a cut of bacon, known as the \"bacon rind\", varies, though is less common in the English-speaking world.\nAround the world.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nThe most common form sold is \"middle bacon\", which includes some of the streaky, fatty section of side bacon along with a portion of the loin of back bacon. In response to increasing consumer diet-consciousness, some supermarkets also offer the loin section only. This is sold as \"short cut bacon\" and is usually priced slightly higher than middle bacon. Both varieties are usually available with the rind removed.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the term \"bacon\" on its own typically refers to side bacon. Canadian-style back bacon is a lean cut from the eye of the pork loin with little surrounding fat. Peameal bacon is an unsmoked back bacon, wet-cured and coated in fine-ground cornmeal (historically, it was rolled in ground, dried peas); it is popular in southern Ontario. Bacon is often eaten in breakfasts, such as with cooked eggs or pancakes. Maple syrup is often used as a flavouring while curing bacon in Canada.\nGermany.\nSome of the meanings of bacon overlap with the German-language term \"Speck\". Germans use the term \"bacon\" explicitly for ('breakfast ') which are cured or smoked pork slices. Traditional German cold cuts favour ham over bacon; however, (grilled pork belly) remains popular in Bavaria.\nSmall bacon cubes (called or in Austria and southern Germany) have been a rather important ingredient of various southern German dishes. They are used for adding flavour to soups and salads and for Speck dumplings and various noodle and potato dishes. Instead of preparing them at home from larger slices, they have been sold ready made as convenience foods recently as (\"bacon cubes\") in German retail stores.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, bacon () is pronounced . It is cured and smoked belly meat as in the US, and is sold in either regular or half-length sizes. Bacon in Japan is different from that in the US in that the meat is not sold raw, but is processed, precooked and has a ham-like consistency when cooked. Uncured, sliced pork belly, known as (), is very popular in Japan and is used in a variety of dishes (e.g. yakitori and yakiniku).\nGreat Britain and Ireland.\nBack bacon is the most common form in Great Britain and Ireland, and is the usual meaning of the plain term \"bacon\". A thin slice of bacon is known as a \"rasher\"; about 70% of bacon is sold as rashers. Heavily trimmed back cuts which consist of just the eye of meat, known as a \"medallion\", are also available. All types may be unsmoked or smoked. The side cut normal in America is known as \"streaky bacon\", and there is also a long cut, curving round on itself, known as \"middle bacon\", which is back bacon at one end, and streaky at the other, as well as less common cuts. Bacon is also sold and served as joints, usually boiled, broiled or roast, or in thicker slices called chops or steaks. These are usually eaten as part of other meals.\nBacon may be cured in several ways, and may be smoked or unsmoked; unsmoked bacon is known as \"green bacon\". Fried or grilled bacon rashers are included in the \"traditional\" full breakfast. Hot bacon sandwiches are a popular cafe dish throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, and are anecdotally recommended as a hangover cure.\nBacon is often served with eggs and sausages as part of a full English breakfast.\nUnited States.\nThe term \"bacon\" on its own generally refers to side bacon, which is the most popular type of bacon sold in the US. Back bacon is known as \"Canadian bacon\" or \"Canadian-style bacon\", and is usually sold pre-cooked and thick-sliced. American bacons include varieties smoked with hickory, mesquite or applewood and flavourings such as maple, brown sugar, honey, or molasses. A side of unsliced bacon is known as \"slab bacon\".\nUSDA regulations only recognise bacon as \"cured\" if it has been treated with synthetic nitrites or nitrates (e.g. sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate). This means that bacon cured with nitrites derived from celery or beets (which has the same chemical outcome) must be labelled \"uncured\" and include a notice such as \"no nitrates or nitrites added except for that naturally occurring in celery\". There is also bacon for sale uncured with any nitrites from any sources.\nHistory.\nSalted pork belly first appeared in China. In Middle English the term or referred to all pork in general. Before the Industrial Revolution, bacon was generally produced on local farms and in domestic kitchens. In the 1770s, John Harris opened the world's first commercial bacon processing plant in Calne, Wiltshire.\nBacon mania.\nThe United States and Canada have seen an increase in the popularity of bacon and bacon-related recipes, dubbed \"bacon mania\". The sale of bacon in the US has increased significantly since 2011. Sales climbed 9.5% in 2013, making it an all-time high of nearly $4 billion in US. In a survey conducted by Smithfield, 65% of Americans would support bacon as their \"national food\". Dishes such as bacon explosion, chicken fried bacon, and chocolate-covered bacon have been popularised over the Internet, as has the use of candied bacon. Recipes spread quickly through both countries' national media, culinary blogs, and YouTube. Celebrity chef Bobby Flay has endorsed a \"Bacon of the Month\" club online, in print, and on national television. \"Everything Tastes Better with Bacon\", a 2002 book by Sara Perry, is a cookbook in which all dishes contain bacon. \nCommentators explain this surging interest in bacon by reference to what they deem American cultural characteristics. Sarah Hepola, in a 2008 article in \"Salon.com\", suggests a number of reasons, one of them being that eating bacon in the modern, health-conscious world is an act of rebellion: \"Loving bacon is like shoving a middle finger in the face of all that is healthy and holy while an unfiltered cigarette smoulders between your lips.\" She also suggests bacon is sexy (with a reference to Sarah Katherine Lewis' book \"Sex and Bacon\"), kitsch, and funny. Hepola concludes by saying \"bacon is America\".\nAlison Cook, writing in the \"Houston Chronicle\", argues the case of bacon's American citizenship by referring to historical and geographical uses of bacon. Early American literature echoes the sentiment\u2014in Ebenezer Cooke's 1708 poem \"The Sot-Weed Factor\", a satire of life in early colonial America, the narrator already complains that practically all the food in America was bacon-infused.\nAs of December 2016, the U.S. national frozen pork belly inventory totaled , the lowest level in 50 years.\nBacon dishes.\nBacon dishes include bacon and eggs, bacon, lettuce, and tomato (BLT) sandwiches, Cobb salad, and various bacon-wrapped foods, such as scallops, shrimp, and asparagus. Recently invented bacon dishes include chicken fried bacon, chocolate covered bacon, bacon jerky, bacon ice cream and the bacon explosion. Tatws Pum Munud is a traditional Welsh stew, made with sliced potatoes, vegetables and smoked bacon. Bacon jam and bacon marmalade are also commercially available.\nStreaky bacon is more commonly used as a topping in the US on such items as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the US, sliced smoked back bacon is used less frequently than the streaky variety, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.\nBacon is also used as an accent in dishes, such as bacon-topped meatloaf, saut\u00e9ed crisp and crumbled into green beans, or as a crumble in a salad.\nBacon bits are crumbled bacon in condiment form, typically commercially prepared and preserved for long shelf life.\nBacon fat.\nBacon fat liquefies and becomes drippings when it is heated. Once cool, it firms into a form of lard. Bacon fat is flavourful and is used for various cooking purposes. Traditionally, bacon grease is saved in British and southern US cuisine, and used as a base for cooking and as an all-purpose flavouring, for everything from gravy to cornbread to salad dressing.\nIn Germany, is a popular spread made from bacon lard.\nBacon is often used for a cooking technique called \"barding\" consisting of laying or wrapping strips of bacon or other fats over a roast to provide additional fat to a lean piece of meat. It is often used for roast game birds, and is a traditional method of preparing beef filet mignon, which is wrapped in strips of bacon before cooking. The bacon itself may afterwards be discarded or served to eat, like cracklings. It may also be cut into lardons.\nOne teaspoon () of bacon grease has 38 calories (40\u00a0kJ/g). It is composed almost completely of fat, with very little additional nutritional value. Bacon fat is roughly 40% saturated. Despite the likely health risks of excessive bacon grease consumption, it remains popular in the cuisine of the American South.\nNutrients.\nOne 10 g slice of cooked side bacon contains 4.5 g of fat, 3.0 g of protein, and 205\u00a0mg of sodium. The fat, protein, and sodium content varies depending on the cut and cooking method.\n68% of the food energy of bacon comes from fat, almost half of which is saturated. A serving of three slices of bacon contains 30 milligrams of cholesterol (0.1%).\nHealth concerns.\nStudies have consistently found the consumption of processed meat to be linked to increased mortality, and to an increased risk of developing a number of serious health conditions including cancer, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. As bacon is very high in salt, it comes with all the negative health effects associated with high salt intake.\nBacon can contain nitrites, which can form carcinogenic nitroso-compounds such as S-Nitrosothiols, nitrosyl-heme and nitrosamines. In the United States, sodium nitrite cannot exceed certain levels in bacon. Vitamin C (ascorbate) or sodium erythorbate can be added to bacon, which greatly reduces the formation of nitrosamines but has no effect on S-Nitrosothiols and nitrosyl-heme. Vitamin E (tocopherol) also reduces nitrosamine levels. Bacon fried at higher temperatures potentially has more nitrosamines than bacon fried at lower temperatures.\nAccording to the World Health Organization in 2015, regular consumption of processed meats such as bacon increases the likelihood of developing colorectal cancers by 18%.\nAlternatives.\nSeveral alternatives to and substitutes for bacon have been developed for those who cannot or prefer not to eat standard pork bacon, including beef, chicken, turkey, bison, soy, and coconut bacon.\nTurkey bacon.\nTurkey bacon is consumed by some as an alternative to pork bacon for health benefits, religious laws, or other concerns. It is lower in fat and food energy than bacon, but is used similarly.\nThe meat for turkey bacon comes from the whole turkey, which is chopped and reformed into strips to resemble bacon, and can be cured or uncured, or smoked. Turkey bacon is cooked by pan-frying. Cured turkey bacon made from dark meat can be less than 10% fat. The low fat content of turkey bacon means it does not shrink while being cooked and has a tendency to stick to the pan.\nMacon.\n\"Macon\" is produced by curing cuts of mutton in a manner similar to the production of pork bacon. Historically produced in Scotland, it was introduced across Britain during World War II as a consequence of rationing. It is today available as an alternative to bacon, produced for the Muslim market and sold at halal butchers; it is largely similar in appearance to pork bacon except for the darker colour.\nVegetarian bacon.\nVegetarian bacon, also referred to as \"facon\", \"veggie bacon\", or \"vacon\", is a vegetarian \"bacon\" made from plant matter. It has no cholesterol, is low in fat, and contains large amounts of protein and fibre. Two slices contain about . Vegetarian bacon is usually made from marinated strips of textured soy protein or tempeh (fermented soybeans).\nBacon-flavoured products.\nThe popularity of bacon in the United States has given rise to a number of commercial products that promise to add bacon flavouring without the labour involved in cooking it.\nBacon bits.\nBacon bits are a frequently used topping on salad or potatoes, and a common element of salad bars. They are usually salted. Bacon bits are made from small, crumbled pieces of bacon; in commercial plants they are cooked in continuous microwave ovens. Similar products are made from ham or turkey, and vegetarian substitutes are made from textured vegetable protein, artificially flavoured to resemble bacon.\nOther bacon-flavoured products.\nThere is also a wide range of other bacon-flavoured products, including a bacon-flavoured salt (Bacon Salt), Baconnaise (a bacon-flavoured mayonnaise), Bacon Grill (a tinned meat, similar to Spam) and bacon ice cream.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

MTBF can be calculated as the arithmetic mean (average) time between failures of a system. The term is used for repairable systems while mean time to failure (MTTF) denotes the expected time to failure for a non-repairable system.\nThe definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a failure. For complex, repairable systems, failures are considered to be those out of design conditions which place the system out of service and into a state for repair. Failures which occur that can be left or maintained in an unrepaired condition, and do not place the system out of service, are not considered failures under this definition. In addition, units that are taken down for routine scheduled maintenance or inventory control are not considered within the definition of failure. The higher the MTBF, the longer a system is likely to work before failing.\nOverview.\nMean time between failures (MTBF) describes the expected time between two failures for a repairable system. For example, three identical systems starting to function properly at time 0 are working until all of them fail. The first system fails after 100 hours, the second after 120 hours and the third after 130 hours. The MTBF of the systems is the average of the three failure times, which is 116.667 hours. If the systems were non-repairable, then their MTTF would be 116.667 hours.\nIn general, MTBF is the \"up-time\" between two failure states of a repairable system during operation as outlined here:\nFor each observation, the \"down time\" is the instantaneous time it went down, which is after (i.e. greater than) the moment it went up, the \"up time\". The difference (\"down time\" minus \"up time\") is the amount of time it was operating between these two events.\nBy referring to the figure above, the MTBF of a component is the sum of the lengths of the operational periods divided by the number of observed failures:\nformula_1\nIn a similar manner, mean down time (MDT) can be defined as\nformula_2\nMathematical description.\nThe MTBF is the expected value of the random variable formula_3 indicating the time until failure. Thus, it can be written as\n formula_4\nwhere formula_5 is the probability density function of formula_3. Equivalently, the MTBF can be expressed in terms of the reliability function formula_7 as\n formula_8.\nThe MTBF and formula_3 have units of time (e.g., hours).\nAny practically-relevant calculation of the MTBF assumes that the system is working within its \"useful life period\", which is characterized by a relatively constant failure rate (the middle part of the \"bathtub curve\") when only random failures are occurring. In other words, it is assumed that the system has survived initial setup stresses and has not yet approached its expected end of life, both of which often increase the failure rate.\nAssuming a constant failure rate formula_10 implies that formula_3 has an exponential distribution with parameter formula_10. Since the MTBF is the expected value of formula_3, it is given by the reciprocal of the failure rate of the system,\n formula_14.\nOnce the MTBF of a system is known, and assuming a constant failure rate, the probability that any one particular system will be operational for a given duration can be inferred from the reliability function of the exponential distribution, formula_15. In particular, the probability that a particular system will survive to its MTBF is formula_16, or about 37% (i.e., it will fail earlier with probability 63%).\nApplication.\nThe MTBF value can be used as a system reliability parameter or to compare different systems or designs. This value should only be understood conditionally as the \u201cmean lifetime\u201d (an average value), and not as a quantitative identity between working and failed units.\nSince MTBF can be expressed as \u201caverage life (expectancy)\u201d, many engineers assume that 50% of items will have failed by time \"t\" = MTBF. This inaccuracy can lead to bad design decisions. Furthermore, probabilistic failure prediction based on MTBF implies the total absence of systematic failures (i.e., a constant failure rate with only intrinsic, random failures), which is not easy to verify. Assuming no systematic errors, the probability the system survives during a duration, T, is calculated as exp^(-T/MTBF). Hence the probability a system fails during a duration T, is given by 1 - exp^(-T/MTBF).\nMTBF value prediction is an important element in the development of products. Reliability engineers and design engineers often use reliability software to calculate a product's MTBF according to various methods and standards (MIL-HDBK-217F, Telcordia SR332, Siemens SN 29500, FIDES, UTE 80-810 (RDF2000), etc.). The Mil-HDBK-217 reliability calculator manual in combination with RelCalc software (or other comparable tool) enables MTBF reliability rates to be predicted based on design.\nA concept which is closely related to MTBF, and is important in the computations involving MTBF, is the mean down time (MDT). MDT can be defined as mean time which the system is down after the failure. Usually, MDT is considered different from MTTR (Mean Time To Repair); in particular, MDT usually includes organizational and logistical factors (such as business days or waiting for components to arrive) while MTTR is usually understood as more narrow and more technical.\nApplication of MTBF in manufacturing.\nMTBF serves as a crucial metric for managing machinery and equipment reliability. Its application is particularly significant in the context of total productive maintenance (TPM), a comprehensive maintenance strategy aimed at maximizing equipment effectiveness. MTBF provides a quantitative measure of the time elapsed between failures of a system during normal operation, offering insights into the reliability and performance of manufacturing equipment.\nBy integrating MTBF with TPM principles, manufacturers can achieve a more proactive maintenance approach. This synergy allows for the identification of patterns and potential failures before they occur, enabling preventive maintenance and reducing unplanned downtime. As a result, MTBF becomes a key performance indicator (KPI) within TPM, guiding decisions on maintenance schedules, spare parts inventory, and ultimately, optimizing the lifespan and efficiency of machinery. This strategic use of MTBF within TPM frameworks enhances overall production efficiency, reduces costs associated with breakdowns, and contributes to the continuous improvement of manufacturing processes.\nMTBF and MDT for networks of components.\nTwo components formula_17 (for instance hard drives, servers, etc.) may be arranged in a network, in \"series\" or in \"parallel\". The terminology is here used by close analogy to electrical circuits, but has a slightly different meaning. We say that the two components are in series if the failure of \"either\" causes the failure of the network, and that they are in parallel if only the failure of \"both\" causes the network to fail. The MTBF of the resulting two-component network with repairable components can be computed according to the following formulae, assuming that the MTBF of both individual components is known:\nformula_18\nwhere formula_19 is the network in which the components are arranged in series.\nFor the network containing parallel repairable components, to find out the MTBF of the whole system, in addition to component MTBFs, it is also necessary to know their respective MDTs. Then, assuming that MDTs are negligible compared to MTBFs (which usually stands in practice), the MTBF for the parallel system consisting from two parallel repairable components can be written as follows:\nformula_20\nwhere formula_21 is the network in which the components are arranged in parallel, and formula_22 is the probability of failure of component formula_23 during \"vulnerability window\" formula_24.\nIntuitively, both these formulae can be explained from the point of view of failure probabilities. First of all, let's note that the probability of a system failing within a certain timeframe is the inverse of its MTBF. Then, when considering series of components, failure of any component leads to the failure of the whole system, so (assuming that failure probabilities are small, which is usually the case) probability of the failure of the whole system within a given interval can be approximated as a sum of failure probabilities of the components. With parallel components the situation is a bit more complicated: the whole system will fail if and only if after one of the components fails, the other component fails while the first component is being repaired; this is where MDT comes into play: the faster the first component is repaired, the less is the \"vulnerability window\" for the other component to fail.\nUsing similar logic, MDT for a system out of two serial components can be calculated as:\nformula_25\nand for a system out of two parallel components MDT can be calculated as:\nformula_26\nThrough successive application of these four formulae, the MTBF and MDT of any network of repairable components can be computed, provided that the MTBF and MDT is known for each component. In a special but all-important case of several serial components, MTBF calculation can be easily generalised into \nformula_27\nwhich can be shown by induction, and likewise\nformula_28\nsince the formula for the mdt of two components in parallel is identical to that of the mtbf for two components in series.\nVariations of MTBF.\nThere are many variations of MTBF, such as \"mean time between system aborts\" (MTBSA), \"mean time between critical failures\" (MTBCF) or \"mean time between unscheduled removal\" (MTBUR). Such nomenclature is used when it is desirable to differentiate among types of failures, such as critical and non-critical failures. For example, in an automobile, the failure of the FM radio does not prevent the primary operation of the vehicle.\nIt is recommended to use \"Mean time to failure\" (MTTF) instead of MTBF in cases where a system is replaced after a failure (\"non-repairable system\"), since MTBF denotes time between failures in a system which can be repaired.\nMTTFd is an extension of MTTF, and is only concerned about failures which would result in a dangerous condition. It can be calculated as follows:\nformula_29\nwhere \"B\"10 is the number of operations that a device will operate prior to 10% of a sample of those devices would fail and \"n\"op is number of operations. \"B\"10d is the same calculation, but where 10% of the sample would fail to danger. \"n\"op is the number of operations/cycle in one year.\nMTBF considering censoring.\nIn fact the MTBF counting only failures with at least some systems still operating that have not yet failed underestimates the MTBF by failing to include in the computations the partial lifetimes of the systems that have not yet failed. With such lifetimes, all we know is that the time to failure exceeds the time they've been running. This is called censoring. In fact with a parametric model of the lifetime, the likelihood for the experience on any given day is as follows:\nformula_30, \nwhere \nformula_31 is the failure time for failures and the censoring time for units that have not yet failed, \nformula_32 = 1 for failures and 0 for censoring times, \nformula_33 = the probability that the lifetime exceeds formula_31, called the survival function, and \nformula_35 is called the hazard function, the instantaneous force of mortality (where formula_36 = the probability density function of the distribution). \nFor a constant exponential distribution, the hazard, formula_10, is constant. In this case, the MBTF is \nMTBF = formula_38, \nwhere formula_39 is the maximum likelihood estimate of formula_10, maximizing the likelihood given above and formula_41 is the number of uncensored observations. \nWe see that the difference between the MTBF considering only failures and the MTBF including censored observations is that the censoring times add to the numerator but not the denominator in computing the MTBF.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The town is 20 miles (32\u00a0km) northeast of Plymouth and 17 miles (27\u00a0km) southwest of Exeter.\nIt was formerly important as a stannary town (a centre for the administration of tin mining), and remains the largest town within the national park. Ashburton has two pubs within the centre of town and six restaurants/caf\u00e9s. The town is also part of the electoral ward named \"Ashburton and Buckfastleigh\", the population of which at the 2011 census was 7,718.\nHistory.\nThe town's name derives from the Old English \"\u00e6sc-burna-tun\" meaning 'farm/settlement with a stream frequented by ash trees'.\nThe name is recorded in the Domesday Book (1086) as \"Essebretone\". Ashburton was then the main town of the Parish of Ashburton, in Teignbridge Hundred. During the English Civil War, Ashburton was a temporary refuge for Royalist troops fleeing after their defeat by General Fairfax at nearby Bovey Tracey.\nThe population in the 1841 census was 3,841 inhabitants.\nThe town was the terminus of the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway that opened on 1 May 1872. Ashburton railway station closed to passengers in November 1958 although goods traffic on the line continued until 7 September 1962. Links to Buckfastleigh and Totnes are maintained by Country Bus route 88 which also serves Newton Abbot.\nAshburton used to be famous for a beverage known as Ashburton Pop, possibly a type of champagne, the recipe of which was lost with the brewer in 1765.\nAshburton Carnival is one of the oldest, possibly the oldest, surviving in Devon. Written records date it back to 1891, but it is believed to have been started in the mid-1880s to raise funds for a new hospital.\nAshburton Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1910. The club continued into the 1920s.\nAshmoor Hockey Club was formed in 2003 and plays at South Dartmoor Community College.\nAshburton Cookery School &amp; Chefs Academy, located to the north of the town, was founded in 1992.\nPolitics.\nAshburton was the first place to elect a candidate of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party to public office. The candidate was Alan Hope, a local publican, who was elected unopposed to Ashburton Town Council in 1989. He subsequently became deputy mayor and later mayor of Ashburton.\nThe town is one of a few to still annually appoint a portreeve or 'port warden'. Others are Laugharne, Beccles, Callington (where the name is given to the council chairman), and Yeovil.\nEducation.\nSouth Dartmoor Community College, a large secondary school for pupils aged 11-18, is located in Ashburton.\nSands School, England's second democratic school, is located in Ashburton.\nSites of interest.\nThe parish church of St Andrew is a Grade One Building and a fine building of the 15th century with a tall tower and two aisles. The 15th-century church tower includes sculptures by Herbert Edmund Read (1885\u20131951), who also carved the oak reredos; this is not the art historian Herbert Read. One window has stained glass designed by C. E. Kempe. The porch is partly Norman.\nSt Lawrence Chapel is a Grade II* Listed Building in St Lawrence Lane in the centre of the town. Originally a chantry chapel and then a grammar school for over 600 years, St Lawrence Chapel is now an important heritage, cultural and community centre, managed by the Guild of St Lawrence.\nThe town's old Methodist Church (Grade II listed) at 15 West St was built in 1835. In 2015 the Methodist congregation moved to the nearby St Andrew's Church Hall. Their previous building was sold by public auction on 19 July 2017, when it was bought by Ashburton Arts Ltd (a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee) using funds donated or loaned by members of the community. The building now houses Ashburton Arts Centre.\nSt Gudula's Well and Cross in Old Totnes Road is probably named after St Gulval, also honoured at the village of Gulval in Cornwall.\nAshburton Town Hall was originally built as a market hall in 1850.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He began his career on the sketch comedy series \"Alfresco\" (1983\u20131984) and the sitcom \"Blackadder\" (1986\u20131989) before gaining recognition as part of the comedy duo Fry and Laurie alongside Hugh Laurie and appearing together in \"A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie\" (1989\u20131995) and \"Jeeves and Wooster\" (1990\u20131993). His later television roles include \"Kingdom\" (2007\u20132009), \"Bones\" (2007\u20132017) and \"It's a Sin\" (2021). Fry was the original host of the comedy panel show \"QI\" (2003\u20132016), for which he was nominated for six British Academy Television Awards. In 2006, the British public ranked Fry number 9 in ITV's poll of TV's 50 Greatest Stars.\nFry's film credits include \"Chariots of Fire\" (1981), \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988) \"Gosford Park\" (2001), \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" (2004), \"V for Vendetta\" (2005), \"\" (2011), and \"Love &amp; Friendship\" (2016). He portrays the Cheshire Cat in \"Alice in Wonderland\" (2010) and its 2016 sequel, and the Master of Lake-town in the film trilogy adaptation of \"The Hobbit\" (2013\u20132014). For playing Oscar Wilde in the film \"Wilde\" (1997), Fry was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. Between 2001 and 2017, he hosted the British Academy Film Awards 12 times.\nFry is known for his work in theatre. In 1984, he adapted \"Me and My Girl\" for the West End where it ran for eight years and received two Laurence Olivier Awards. After it transferred to Broadway, he received a Tony Award nomination. In 2012, Fry played Malvolio in \"Twelfth Night\" at Shakespeare's Globe. The production was then taken to the West End, before transferring to Broadway where he received a nomination for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.\nFry has written and presented several documentary series, including the Emmy Award-winning \"\" (2006) and the travel series \"Stephen Fry in America\" (2008). He is also a prolific writer, contributing to newspapers and magazines, and has written four novels and three autobiographies. He has lent his voice to numerous projects including the audiobooks for all seven of the \"Harry Potter\" novels as well as the \"Paddington Bear\" books. Since 2011, Fry has served as president of the mental health charity Mind. In 2025, Fry was knighted for services to mental health awareness, the environment and charity.\nEarly life and education.\nStephen John Fry was born on 24 August 1957 in the Hampstead area of London, the son of historian Marianne Eve Fry (n\u00e9e Neumann) and physicist and inventor Alan John Fry (1930\u20132019). He has an older brother, Roger, and a younger sister, Joanna. His paternal grandmother, Ella Fry (n\u00e9e Pring), had roots in Cheshire and Kent. The Fry family originates around the Shillingstone and Blandford areas of Dorset; in the early 1800s, Samuel Fry settled in Surrey, with his descendants residing in Middlesex. In his autobiographical writings and elsewhere, Fry has claimed relationship to the Fry family that founded the eponymous chocolate company, John Fry (one of the signatories to the death warrant for Charles I), and the cricketer C. B. Fry. Fry's mother is Jewish, but he was not brought up in a religious family. His maternal grandparents, Martin and Rosa Neumann, were Hungarian Jews who emigrated from \u0160urany (now in Slovakia) to the UK in 1927. Rosa's parents, who originally lived in Vienna, were deported to a Nazi ghetto in Riga, where they were killed. His mother's aunt and cousins were sent to Auschwitz and Stutthof and never seen again.\nFry grew up in the village of Booton, Norfolk, having moved at an early age from Chesham, Buckinghamshire, where he had attended Chesham Preparatory School. He briefly attended Cawston Primary School in Cawston, Norfolk, before going on to Stouts Hill Preparatory School in Uley, Gloucestershire, at the age of seven, and then to Uppingham School in Rutland, where he joined Fircroft house and was described as a \"near-asthmatic genius\". He took his O-levels in 1972 at the early age of 14 and passed all except physics, but was expelled from Uppingham half a term into the sixth form. Fry described himself as a \"monstrous\" child and wrote that he was expelled for \"various misdemeanours\". He was later dismissed from Paston School, a grant-maintained grammar school that refused to let him progress to study A-Levels.\nFry moved to Norfolk College of Arts and Technology, where, after two years in the sixth form studying English, French, and History of Art, he ultimately failed his A-Levels, not turning up for his English and French papers. Over the summer, Fry absconded with a credit card stolen from a family friend. He had taken a coat when leaving a pub, planning to spend the night sleeping rough, but had then discovered the card in a pocket. He was arrested in Swindon and, as a result, spent three months in Pucklechurch Remand Centre on remand. Following his release, he resumed his education at City College Norwich, promising administrators that he would study rigorously and sit the University of Cambridge entrance exams. In 1977 he passed two A-levels in English and French, with grades of A and B. He also received a grade A in an alternative O-level in the Study of Art and scored a distinction in an S-level paper in English. Having successfully passed the entrance exams in 1977, Fry was offered a scholarship at Queens' College, Cambridge, for matriculation in 1978, briefly teaching at Cundall Manor School, a preparatory school in North Yorkshire, before taking his place. At Cambridge, he joined the Footlights, appeared on the \"University Challenge\" TV quiz, and read English Literature, graduating with an upper second-class honours BA degree in 1981 (subsequently promoted automatically to a Cambridge MA degree). Fry also met his future comedy collaborator Hugh Laurie (through their mutual friend Emma Thompson) at Cambridge and starred alongside him in the Footlights.\nCareer.\n1981\u20131993: Sketch comedy beginnings.\nFry wrote the play \"Latin! or Tobacco and Boys\" for the 1980 Edinburgh Festival, where it won the Fringe First prize. It had a revival in 2009 at London's Cock Tavern Theatre, directed by Adam Spreadbury-Maher. \"The Cellar Tapes\", the Footlights Revue of 1981, won the Perrier Comedy Award. In 1984, Fry adapted the hugely successful 1930s musical \"Me and My Girl\" for the West End, where it ran for eight years and received two Laurence Olivier Awards. The show transferred to Broadway and Fry was nominated for a Tony Award for his adaptation.\nFry has appeared in numerous advertisements, predominantly on UK television \u2013 either on-screen or in voice-over \u2013 starting with an appearance as \"Count Ivan Skavinsky Skavar\" in a 1982 advert for Whitbread Best Bitter. Fry has said, in his memoirs, that after receiving his payment for this work \u2013 \u00a325,000 \u2013 he has never subsequently experienced \"what one could call serious money troubles\". He has since appeared in adverts for products and companies such as Marks &amp; Spencer, Twinings, Kenco, Vauxhall Motors, Honda, Calpol, Heineken, Alliance &amp; Leicester (a series of adverts which also featured Hugh Laurie), After Eight mints, Direct Line insurance (with Paul Merton), Trebor mints, Virgin Media, Walkers potato crisps (fronting a new flavour), and Sainsbury's supermarket. He filmed a 2016 advertisement where he explains the essence of British culture to foreigners arriving at London's Heathrow Airport.\nFry's career in television began with the 1982 broadcasting of \"The Cellar Tapes\", the 1981 Cambridge Footlights Revue which was written by Fry, Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson, and Tony Slattery. The revue caught the attention of Granada Television, who, keen to replicate the success of the BBC's \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", hired Fry, Laurie and Thompson to star alongside Ben Elton in \"There's Nothing to Worry About!\" A second series, retitled \"Alfresco\", was broadcast in 1983, and a third in 1984; it established Fry and Laurie's reputation as a comedy double act. In 1983, the BBC offered Fry, Laurie and Thompson their own show, which became \"The Crystal Cube\", a mixture of science fiction and mockumentary that was cancelled after the first episode. Undeterred, Fry, Laurie and Thompson appeared in \"Bambi\", an episode of \"The Young Ones\" from 1984 where they parodied themselves as the \"University Challenge\" representatives of \"Footlights College, Oxbridge\", and Fry also appeared in Ben Elton's 1985 \"Happy Families\" series. In April 1986, Fry was among the British comedians who appeared in the first live telethon Comic Relief. In 1986 and 1987, Fry and Laurie performed sketches on the LWT/Channel 4 show \"Saturday Live\".\nIn 1986, the BBC commissioned a sketch show that was to become \"A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie\". Following a 1987 pilot, the programme ran for 26 episodes across four series between 1989 and 1995. During this time, Fry starred in \"Blackadder II\" as Lord Melchett, made a guest appearance in \"\" as the Duke of Wellington, then returned to a starring role in \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", as General Melchett. In a 1988 television special, \"Blackadder's Christmas Carol\", he played the roles of Lord Melchett and Lord Frondo. Between 1990 and 1993, Fry starred as Jeeves (alongside Hugh Laurie's Bertie Wooster) in \"Jeeves and Wooster\", 23 hour-long adaptations of P. G. Wodehouse's novels and short stories. Fry has appeared in a number of BBC adaptations of plays and books, including a 1992 adaptation of the Simon Gray play \"The Common Pursuit\" (he had previously appeared in the West End stage production).\nHaving made his film d\u00e9but in \"The Good Father\" (1985), followed by a brief cameo in \"A Fish Called Wanda\" (1988; getting clobbered by Kevin Kline in an airport), Fry was then featured by Kenneth Branagh as the eponymous Peter in \"Peter's Friends\" (1992). Fry came to the attention of radio listeners with the 1986 creation of his alter-ego, Donald Trefusis, whose \"wireless essays\" were broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme \"Loose Ends\". In the 1980s, he starred as David Lander in four series of the BBC Radio 4 show \"Delve Special\", written by Tony Sarchet, which then became the six-part Channel 4 series \"This is David Lander\" in 1988. In 1988, Fry wrote and presented a six-part comedy series entitled \"Saturday Night Fry\". Frequent radio appearances have ensued, notably on panel games \"Just a Minute\" and \"I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\".\nFry was cast in Simon Gray's \"The Common Pursuit\" for its first staging in the West End on 7 April 1988, with Rik Mayall, John Sessions, Sarah Berger, Paul Mooney and John Gordon Sinclair, directed by Simon Gray. Fry is a long-standing fan of the anarchic British musical comedy group the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, and particularly of its eccentric front man, the late Vivian Stanshall. Fry helped to fund a 1988 London re-staging of Stanshall's \"Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera\", written by Vivian and Ki Longfellow-Stanshall for the Bristol-based Old Profanity Showboat.\n1994\u20132008: Film roles, voice work and \"QI\".\nFry's first novel, \"The Liar,\" was published in 1991. Fry has since written three further novels, several non-fiction works and three volumes of autobiography. \"Making History\" (1996) is partly set in an alternative universe in which Adolf Hitler's father is made infertile and his replacement proves a more effective F\u00fchrer. The book won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. \"The Hippopotamus\" (1994) is about Edward (Ted/Tedward) Wallace and his stay at his old friend Lord Logan's country manor in Norfolk. \"The Hippopotamus\" was later adapted into a 2017 film. \"The Stars' Tennis Balls\" (2000) is a modern retelling of \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". Fry's book \"\" is a guide to writing poetry.\nWhen writing a book review for \"Tatler\", Fry wrote under a pen name, Williver Hendry, editor of \"A Most Peculiar Friendship: The Correspondence of Lord Alfred Douglas and Jack Dempsey\", a field close to his heart as an Oscar Wilde enthusiast. Once a columnist in \"The Listener\" and \"The Daily Telegraph\", he wrote a weekly technology column in the Saturday edition of \"The Guardian\". His blog attracted more than 300,000 visitors in its first two weeks.\nFry was cast in a lead role in Simon Gray's 1995 play \"Cell Mates\", which he left three days into the West End run, pleading stage fright. He later recalled the incident as a hypomanic episode in his documentary about bipolar disorder, \"The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive\". He acted in a 1998 Malcolm Bradbury adaptation of the Mark Tavener novel \"In the Red\", taking the part of the Controller of BBC Radio 2; and in 2000 in the role of Professor Bellgrove in the BBC serial \"Gormenghast\", which was adapted from the first two novels of Mervyn Peake's \"Gormenghast\" series. In the 1994 romantic comedy film \"I.Q.\", he played the role of James Moreland. Portraying his idol Oscar Wilde (of whom he had been an ardent admirer since the age of 13) in the 1997 film \"Wilde\", he fulfilled the role to critical acclaim. It earned him a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Drama. In 1997, he also had a cameo in the Spice Girls film \"Spice World\". A year later, Fry starred in David Yates' small independent film \"The Tichborne Claimant\", and in 2001, he played the detective in Robert Altman's period costume drama, \"Gosford Park\". In the same year, he also appeared in the Dutch film \"The Discovery of Heaven\", directed by Jeroen Krabb\u00e9 and based on the novel by Harry Mulisch.\nIn 2000, he began starring as Charles Prentiss in the Radio 4 comedy \"Absolute Power\", reprising the role for three further series on radio, and two on television. In 2002, he played The Minister of Chance in the Doctor Who audio drama \"Death Comes to Time\". In 2002, Fry was one of the narrators of A. A. Milne's \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" and \"The House at Pooh Corner\", in which he voiced Winnie-the-Pooh. He presented a 20-part, two-hour series, \"The Incomplete and Utter History of Classical Music\", a \"witty guide\" to the genre over the past 1,000 years, on Classic FM. In 2004 he was the narrator for an adaptation of \"Vanity Fair\" on BBC Radio 4. Fry has been the reader for the British versions of all of J. K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series of audiobooks. He discussed this project in an interview with Rowling in 2005. He has also read for Douglas Adams' \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" film tie-in edition and has made recordings of his own books, such as \"The Stars' Tennis Balls\" and \"Moab Is My Washpot\", and of works by Roald Dahl, Michael Bond, A. A. Milne, Anthony Buckeridge, Eleanor Updale, George Orwell, and Alexander Pushkin.\nIn 2003, Fry began hosting \"QI\" (Quite Interesting), a comedy panel game television quiz show. \"QI\" was created and co-produced by John Lloyd, and features permanent panellist Alan Davies. \"QI\" has the highest viewing figures for any show on BBC Four and Dave (formerly UKTV G2). In 2006, Fry won the Rose d'Or award for \"Best Game Show Host\" for his work on the series. In October 2015, it was announced that Fry would retire as the host of \"QI\" after the \"M\" series, and he was replaced by Sandi Toksvig.\nTowards the end of 2003, Fry starred alongside John Bird in the television adaptation of \"Absolute Power\", previously a radio series on BBC Radio 4. Fry's first documentary was the Emmy Award-winning \"\" in 2006. The same year, he appeared on the BBC's genealogy series \"Who Do You Think You Are?\", tracing his maternal family tree to investigate his Jewish ancestry. In 2003, Fry made his directorial d\u00e9but with \"Bright Young Things\", adapted by him from Evelyn Waugh's \"Vile Bodies\". In 2001, he began hosting the BAFTA Film Awards, a role from which he stepped down in 2006. Later that same year, he wrote the English libretto and dialogue for Kenneth Branagh's film adaptation of \"The Magic Flute\". Fry continued to make regular film appearances, notably in treatments of literary cult classics. He portrayed the clairvoyant Maurice Woodruff in \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" and served as narrator in the 2005 film version of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". In 2005, he appeared in \"A Cock and Bull Story\", based on \"Tristram Shandy\". In the same year, in \"V for Vendetta\", he played a closeted TV presenter who challenges a fascist state - the screenwriters, The Wachowskis, pointed out that it was Fry's \"normalcy\" in the face of the insanity of the censorship of BTV that made his character truly powerful and added a \"wholly unexpected dimension to the film\". Fry performed several of Stanshall's numbers as part of the Bonzos' 2006 reunion concert at the London Astoria.\nIn 2006, he played the role of gadget-master Smithers in \"Stormbreaker\", and in 2007, he appeared as himself hosting a quiz in \"St Trinian's\". In 2007, Fry wrote, for director Peter Jackson, a script for a remake of \"The Dam Busters\". That year he also appeared in \"Eichmann\" (2007). Fry narrated \"The Story of Light Entertainment\", which was shown from July\u2013September 2006. In 2007, he presented a documentary on the subject of HIV and AIDS, \"HIV and Me\". In 2007, Fry wrote a Christmas pantomime, \"Cinderella\", which ran at London's Old Vic Theatre. In 2007, he hosted \"Current Puns\", an exploration of wordplay, and \"Radio 4: This Is Your Life\", to celebrate the radio station's 40th anniversary. He also interviewed the Prime Minister Tony Blair as part of a series of podcasts released by 10 Downing Street.

Fry later posted an apology in a six-page post on his personal blog, in which he apologised for his remarks, stating that \"I didn't even really at the time notice the import of what I had said, so gave myself no opportunity instantly to retract the statement. It was a rubbishy, cheap and offensive remark that I have been regretting ever since.

In his first autobiography, he described how he once considered ordination to the Anglican priesthood, but came to the conclusion that he \"couldn't believe in God, because [he] was fundamentally Hellenic in [his] outlook\". He has stated that religion can have positive effects: \"Sometimes belief means credulity, sometimes an expression of faith and hope which even the most sceptical atheist such as myself cannot but find inspiring.\" Fry claims to have been expelled from Salt Lake City, Utah, because of a joke made about doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nIn 2009, \"The Guardian\" published a letter from Fry addressing his younger self, explaining how his future is soon to unfold, reflecting on the positive progression towards gay acceptance and openness around him, and yet not everywhere, while warning on how \"the cruel, hypocritical and loveless hand of religion and absolutism has fallen on the world once more\". Later that year, he and Christopher Hitchens participated in an \"Intelligence Squared\" debate in which they argued against Ann Widdecombe and Archbishop John Onaiyekan, who supported the view that the Catholic Church was a force for good. Fry and Hitchens argued that the church did more harm than good, and were declared the victors after an audience vote. Fry attacked the Catholic Church's teachings on sexuality and denounced its wealth.\nIn 2010, Fry was made a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association, stating: \"it is essential to nail one's colours to the mast as a humanist.\" Later that year, Fry joined 54 other public figures in signing an open letter published in \"The Guardian\" stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom being a state visit. On 22 February 2011, Fry was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University.\nWhen interviewed in 2015 by the Irish broadcaster Gay Byrne, Fry was asked what he would say if he came face-to-face with God, to which he replied: \"Bone cancer in children: what's that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that's not our fault? It's utterly, utterly evil. Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?\" Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion: \"I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going all the way back to the Greeks.\" \"Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.\" In May 2017, it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RT\u00c9, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the Defamation Act 2009, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after Garda\u00ed confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people. The following year, in 2018, the article on blasphemy was removed from the Irish Constitution following a referendum.\nHe has praised Anglican priest Michael Coren's book \"The Rebel Christ\", saying: \"Integrity, wit and passion. A fine advocate for the best of Christian thought and a faith that encompasses the human as well as the divine.\"\nVentures.\nNarration.\nFry is known for his extensive voice-over work; he read all seven of the \"Harry Potter\" novels for the UK audiobook recordings, narrated Paddington Bear audiobooks, narrated the video game series \"LittleBigPlanet\" and \"Birds of Steel\", narrated an animated series of explanations of the laws of cricket and narrated a series of animations about humanism for Humanists UK.\nTwitter.\nFry wielded a considerable amount of influence through his use of Twitter. He was frequently asked to promote various charities and causes, often inadvertently causing their websites to crash because of the volume of traffic generated by his large number of followers; as Fry noted on his website: \"Four thousand hits a second all diving down the pipeline at the same time for minutes on end.\" He used his influence to recommend underexposed musicians and authors (who often saw large increases in web hits and sales) and to raise awareness of contemporary issues in the world of media and politics, notably the dropping of an injunction against \"The Guardian\" and public anger over \"Daily Mail\" columnist Jan Moir's article on the death of Boyzone member Stephen Gately.\nIn November 2009, Fry's Twitter account reached one million followers. He commemorated the million-followers milestone with a humorous video blog in which a 'Step Hen Fry' clone speaks from the year 2034, where MySpace, Facebook and Twitter have combined to form 'Twit on MyFace'. In November 2010, he welcomed his two-millionth follower with a blog entry detailing his opinions and experiences of Twitter. On 11 March 2012, Fry noted his passing of the four-million-followers mark with a tweet: \"Lordy I've breasted the 4 million followers tape. Love you all. Yes even YOU. But let's dedicate today to Douglas Adams's diamond jubilee\". As of June\u00a02021[ [update]] he had 12.4\u00a0million followers.\nFry had a history of temporarily distancing himself from the social networking site which began when he received criticism in October 2009. However, he retracted the announcement that he would be leaving the following day. In October 2010, Fry left Twitter for a few days, with a farewell message of \"Bye bye\", following press criticism of a quote taken from an interview he had given. After returning, he explained that he had left Twitter to \"avoid being sympathised with or told about an article\" he \"would otherwise never have got wind of\". The methods Fry uses on Twitter have been criticised. On 15 February 2016, Fry deleted his Twitter account after receiving criticism for a tweet commenting on Jenny Beavan's outfit choice at that year's BAFTAs where she received an award for costume design. Fry alluded to this on an April 2016 episode of \"The Rubin Report\" in which he criticised groupthink mentality and stated that his return to Twitter was a \"maybe\". He returned to Twitter in August 2016. He left Twitter again in November 2022, joining Mastodon that same month.\nSport.\nIn August 2010, Fry joined the board of directors at Norwich City Football Club. A lifelong fan of \"the Canaries\" and a regular visitor to Carrow Road, he said, on being appointed, \"Truly this is one of the most exciting days of my life, and I am as proud and pleased as I could be.\" Fry stepped down from his Board position in January 2016, to take up a new position as \"Norwich City Ambassador\". Fry said, \"My five years in the role have been an honour and a privilege beyond almost anything I can remember. I wish I could take credit for ushering the club up from League One to the Premiership during that time on the Board. Actually, I'm going to. It was all me. It can't have been a coincidence ... But now I'm so happy to relinquish my seat on the board to Thomas Smith and to engage as fully as I can in the role of ambassador for Norwich City.\" In February 2014, Fry became the honorary president of Proud Canaries, a supporters' group for Norwich City's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender fans.\nFry succeeded Clare Connor to become president of Marylebone Cricket Club on 1 October 2022, relinquishing the role after one year to his successor Mark Nicholas in 2023.\nBusiness.\nIn 2008, Fry formed SamFry Ltd, with long-term collaborator Andrew Sampson to produce and fund new material and to manage his official website. Fry is the co-owner, with Gina Carter and Sandi Toksvig, of Sprout Pictures, an independent film and television company.\nIn 2016, Fry launched Pindex, \"a self-funded online platform that creates and curates educational videos and infographics for teachers and students,\" founded and run by a four-person team.\nCharity.\nIn 2008, Fry appeared in a film made by the Free Software Foundation to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the GNU Project to create a completely free operating system. In the film, Fry explains the principles of software freedom central to the development of the Linux and GNU software projects. For the Comic Relief telethon in 2011, Fry was one of four celebrities who represented a new flavour of Walkers crisps: \"Stephen Fry Up\", with the flavour inspired by the full English breakfast (also known as a 'fry up'). In 2014, Fry designed a Paddington Bear statue, one of fifty located around London prior to the release of the film \"Paddington\", which was auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).\nFry is a supporter of nature and wildlife conservation. He has been the president of the Great Fen Project since 2006 and vice-president of international NGO Fauna and Flora International since 2009. Fry has also expressed support for action on climate change and activist group Extinction Rebellion, and has criticized climate change denial.\nIn April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Fry appeared in a sketch alongside Prince William for a charity show titled \"The Big Night In\" on BBC One. In the lighthearted sketch, Fry reprises his \"Blackadder\" character Lord Melchett, who is on a Zoom call with the then Duke of Cambridge as they talk about television shows such as \"EastEnders\" and \"Tiger King\" as well as homeschooling. The sketch had been put together by Comic Relief and Children in Need to raise money and keep people entertained during the lockdown. In March 2021, Fry narrated a short film for Cambridge Children's Hospital.\nFry has been the patron of UK audiobook charity Listening Books since 2005.\nBibliography.\nAs author.\nFiction\nNon-fiction\nAutobiography\nScripts from \"A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as leader of the Liberal Party and leader of the Opposition from 1984 to 1990.\nTurner practised law before being elected as a member of Parliament (MP) in the 1962 federal election. He served in the cabinet of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau as minister of justice and attorney general from 1968 to 1972 and then as minister of finance from 1972 to 1975. As a cabinet minister, Turner came to be known as a leader of the Business Liberal faction of the Liberal Party. Amid a global recession and the prospect of having to implement unpopular wage and price controls, Turner resigned from his position in 1975.\nFrom 1976 to 1984, Turner took a hiatus from politics, working as a corporate lawyer on Bay Street. Trudeau's resignation in 1984 triggered a leadership election, which Turner successfully contested. When he was sworn in as prime minister after winning the leadership election, Turner was not an MP or senator \u2014 the last time this would occur until Mark Carney in 2025. Turner held the office of prime minister for just 79 days, as he advised the governor general to dissolve Parliament soon after being sworn in. He went on to lose the 1984 election in a landslide to Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives, leading the Liberals to the second-worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level (in terms of proportion of seats). Turner stayed on as Liberal leader and led the Opposition for the next six years. In the 1988 election, he vigorously campaigned against Mulroney's proposed free trade agreement with the United States, and led the Liberals to a modest recovery. Turner resigned as party leader in 1990 and did not seek re-election as an MP in 1993.\nTurner was Canada's first prime minister born in the United Kingdom since Mackenzie Bowell in 1896, Canada's second shortest-serving prime minister behind Charles Tupper, and Canada's fourth longest-lived prime minister, living to the age of 91.\nEarly life.\nTurner was born on June 7, 1929, in Richmond, Surrey, England (now a part of London), to Leonard Hugh Turner, an English journalist with the \"Manchester Guardian\", and Phyllis Gregory, a Canadian economist. He had a brother, Michael, born in 1930 (who died shortly after birth), and a sister, Brenda, born in 1931. When Turner's father died in 1932, he and his sister moved to Canada with their Canadian-born mother. The family settled in her childhood home in Rossland, British Columbia, and later moved to Ottawa.\nTurner's mother was loving but demanding of her two children. The family was not wealthy. His mother remarried in 1945 to Frank Mackenzie Ross, who later served as Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, and the family relocated to Vancouver.\nEducation.\nTurner was educated at Ashbury College and St Patrick's College, Ottawa (senior matriculation). He enrolled at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1945 at age 16 where he was a member of the UBC chapter of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, and was among Canada's outstanding track sprinters in the late 1940s. He held the Canadian record for the men's 100-yard dash and qualified for the 1948 London Olympics, but a bad knee kept him from competing. He graduated from UBC with a BA (Honours) in 1949.\nAwarded a Rhodes Scholarship, Turner went on to Magdalen College at the University of Oxford, where he earned a BA in jurisprudence in 1951, and a BCL in 1952; his BA was promoted to an MA per tradition in 1957. He was on the track and field team at Oxford. One of his teammates was Roger Bannister, who became the first runner to break the four-minute barrier in the mile. At Oxford, Turner was a classmate and friend of future Australian Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser and Bob Hawke, as well as Jeremy Thorpe, future leader of Britain's Liberal Party. He also pursued doctoral studies at the University of Paris from 1952 to 1953.\nRelationship with Princess Margaret.\nOn July 25, 1958, a ball was hosted by Turner's mother and stepfather (in the latter's role of Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia), in honour of Princess Margaret at HMCS Discovery, the Canadian navy's land station in Vancouver. Turner danced with Princess Margaret, one year his junior, and they sat out talking, refusing requests to return to supper. This was the first time that Turner received significant press attention in Canada. Further meetings between them during Margaret's three week official visit to Canada led to considerable speculation about whether the two would become a serious couple. Contemporary press reports suggested there was some consternation about the reports among British officials, but their Canadian counterparts were more relaxed.\nA year later, in September 1959, press attention returned when reports circulated that Turner had been a recent guest at Balmoral in August where discussions had taken place concerning marriage between the pair; that he had also paid a secret visit to see her in April and that his parents had commented on their close friendship during their visit to Scotland in August.\nAccording to letters discovered in 2015, written by Margaret to her friend Sharman Douglas and obtained by the \"Daily Mail\", the relationship was more serious than previously thought with the princess writing in one letter, seven years later: \"John Turner is here &amp; we meet on Thursday. It will seem so funny as we haven't met since I nearly married him &amp; he's bringing his wife!\". Turner told the \"Daily Mail\": \"I have never talked about it, and I am not going to start talking about it now\". Brenda confirmed a \"very definite attraction\" between her brother and the princess, but said that Turner was uninterested in royalty and would not have given up Catholicism.\nIt has been claimed Turner attended Margaret's party at Balmoral Castle in August 1959 where his roommate was Margaret's future husband Antony Armstrong-Jones; however, according to his authorized biography, Armstrong-Jones visited Balmoral for the first time in early October 1959. Turner was the only Canadian unofficial guest at their wedding in May 1960. Turner remained friends with Margaret, he and his wife often meeting the princess in Britain or during official visits to Canada. They attended Margaret's 2002 private funeral and were Canada's official representatives at the memorial service.\nMarriage and family.\nTurner was married on May 11, 1963, to Geills McCrae Kilgour (b. 1937) who was then a systems engineer with IBM, and the great niece of Canadian Army doctor John McCrae, the author of what is probably the best-known First World War poem, \"In Flanders Fields\", and sister of David Kilgour, a long-time Canadian Member of Parliament. The Turners had daughter named Elizabeth and two sons: Michael and Andrew. Their second son, David, died in 2021. The Turner children attended Rockcliffe Park Public School, in Ottawa. All three sons attended Upper Canada College, in Toronto.\nEarly career.\nTurner practised law, initially with the firm of Stikeman Elliott in Montreal, Quebec. He was elected as Member of Parliament for St. Lawrence\u2014St. George in 1962 and was reelected there in every election until the riding's dissolution in 1968. He was the Member of Parliament for Ottawa\u2014Carleton from 1968 to 1976.\nIn 1965, while vacationing in Barbados, Turner noticed that former prime minister and Leader of the Opposition John Diefenbaker, staying at the same hotel, was struggling in the strong surf and undertow. Turner, a competitive swimmer while in university, jumped in and pulled Diefenbaker to shore.\nCabinet minister.\nTurner was generally respected for his work as a cabinet minister in the 1960s and 1970s, under prime ministers Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.\nPremiership of Lester Pearson.\nTurner served in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Lester Pearson in various capacities, most notably as Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. When Pearson retired, Turner ran to succeed him at the 1968 leadership convention. Turner, at age 38 the youngest of the dozen leadership candidates, stated \"My time is now\", and remarked during his speech that he was \"not here for some vague, future convention in, say, 1984\". Turner stayed on until the fourth and final ballot, finishing third behind Pierre Trudeau and runner-up Robert Winters.\nPremiership of Pierre Trudeau.\nTurner served in Trudeau's cabinet as minister of justice for four years. Biographer Paul Litt argues that Turner was a hard-working, well-informed minister whose success was assured by his warm relationship with his peers. His achievements, say Litt, included strengthening the rights of individual defendants on trial, greater efficiency in the justice system, creation of the influential Law Reform Commission, selecting highly professional judges, and bringing a policy perspective to the Justice Department. He led the government's position in the highly controversial Official Languages Act, and he took control during the October Crisis in 1970.\nA member of the Business Liberal faction of the Liberal Party, Turner then served as Minister of Finance from 1972 until 1975. His challenges were severe in the face of global financial issues such as the 1973 oil crisis, the collapse of the postwar Bretton Woods trading system, slowing economic growth combined with soaring inflation (stagflation), and growing deficits. His positions were more conservative than Trudeau's and they drew apart. In 1975 Turner surprisingly resigned from cabinet. The Liberals had won the 1974 election by attacking Robert Stanfield's Progressive Conservatives over their platform involving wage and price controls. However, Trudeau decided to implement the wage and price controls in late 1975. In a 2013 interview with Catherine Clark on CPAC, Turner confirmed his resignation from cabinet was a direct result of refusing to implement wage and price controls, after campaigning against them in 1974.\nIn his memoirs, Trudeau wrote that Turner said he resigned as Finance Minister in 1975 because he was tired of politics, after 13 years in Ottawa, and wanted to move on to a better-paying job as a lawyer in Toronto, to better support his family and to be with them more, as his children were growing up. Trudeau also suggested that Turner's years as finance minister were very difficult because of turbulent and unusual conditions in the world economy, characterized as stagflation, largely caused by enormous increases in the price of oil.\nBay Street.\nFrom 1975 to 1984, Turner worked as a corporate lawyer at the Bay Street law firm McMillan Binch. When Pierre Trudeau resigned as Liberal leader in 1979 following an election loss, Turner announced that he would not be a candidate for the Liberal leadership. Trudeau was talked into rescinding his resignation after the government of Joe Clark was defeated by a motion of no confidence, and returned to contest and win the 1980 federal election. Trudeau then served as Prime Minister until 1984.\nPrime Minister (June\u2013September 1984).\nTrudeau retired after polls showed the Liberals faced certain defeat in the next election if he remained in office. Turner then re-entered politics, and defeated Jean Chr\u00e9tien, his successor as finance minister, on the second ballot of the June 1984 Liberal leadership convention. He was formally appointed prime minister on June 30. When he was sworn in, Turner was not an MP or senator; the next occurrence of a PM not being elected to the Commons or Senate would be Mark Carney in 2025. He also announced that he would not run in a by-election to get into the Commons, but would instead run in the next general election as the Liberal candidate in the British Columbia riding of Vancouver Quadra, a seat held by the Tories. This was part of Turner's strategy to rebuild the Liberals' image in western Canada; at the time, the party held no seats west of Winnipeg.\nIn his final days of office, Trudeau recommended that Governor General Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 appoint over 200 Liberals to patronage positions, including senators, judges, and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards. Turner then made a further 19 appointments himself, one of Trudeau's conditions for retiring earlier than he had planned.\n1984 federal election.\nOn July 9, only nine days after being sworn in, Turner asked Sauv\u00e9 to dissolve parliament and advised her to call an election for early September. Progressive Conservative leader Brian Mulroney and other experts had expected Turner to tour Canada during the summer and early autumn, accompanying Queen Elizabeth II and Pope John Paul II on their upcoming visits, and then call the election for later in the autumn. As the campaign unfolded, the Tories and Mulroney, who was fighting his first general election in any capacity, soon took the lead.\nEarly in the campaign, Turner appeared rusty and old-fashioned. His policies contrasted with Trudeau's and seemed to legitimize the Tory calls for lowering the deficit, improving relations with the United States, cutting the bureaucracy, and promoting more federal-provincial harmony. He spoke of creating \"make work projects\", a discarded phrase from the 1970s that had been replaced by the less patronizing \"job creation programs\". Turner was also caught on television patting the bottoms of Liberal Party President Iona Campagnolo and Vice-President Lise St. Martin-Tremblay, causing an uproar among feminists, who saw such behaviour as sexist and condescending.\nDuring the televised leaders' debate, Turner attacked Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had allegedly set up in anticipation of victory, comparing it to the Union Nationale governments of Quebec. Mulroney responded by pointing to the raft of patronage appointments made on the advice of Trudeau and Turner. Turner had the right to advise Sauv\u00e9 to cancel Trudeau's appointments\u2014advice that she was bound to follow by convention\u2014but failed to do so and added to his own. Mulroney demanded that Turner apologize to the country for what he called \"these horrible appointments.\" Turner claimed that \"I had no option\" except to let them stand. Mulroney responded, \"You had an option, sir\u00a0\u2013 to say 'no'\u00a0\u2013 and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party.\" He highlighted the Liberals' long record in government and resulting patronage appointments.\nTurner discovered late in the campaign that the Liberals' electoral hopes were poor in their traditional stronghold of Quebec. The party had heretofore relied on Trudeau's appeal, patronage, and traditional dislike of the Progressive Conservatives for victory in recent previous elections. Turner had surrounded himself with Trudeau's factional opponents and Trudeau himself did not endorse Turner. In a last-minute turnaround, Turner rehired much of Trudeau's staff during the final weeks, but this had little effect. Quebec's disaffection with the federal Liberals regarding patriation in 1982 further contributed to their defeat. Mulroney, a native Quebecker, was able to harness that discontent to the Progressive Conservatives' advantage by promising a new constitutional agreement.\nOn September 4, the Liberals were swept from power in a Tory landslide. The Liberals were cut down to 40 seats, the fewest in the party's history until 2011, against 211 for the Progressive Conservatives. The Liberals fell to 17 seats in Quebec, all but four in and around Montreal. Eleven members of Turner's cabinet were defeated. It was the worst defeat the Liberals experienced in a federal election since 1958.\nTurner stepped down as prime minister on September 17. The election having been called just over a week after his being sworn in, Turner held the office of prime minister for two months and seventeen days, the second-shortest stint in Canadian history, ahead of only Sir Charles Tupper, who took office after dissolution of parliament. Turner, along with Tupper and later Mulroney's successor, Kim Campbell, were the only PMs who never faced a parliament or implemented any legislative initiative.\nOpposition leader (1984\u20131990).\nIn 1984, Turner managed to defeat the Tory incumbent in Vancouver Quadra, Bill Clarke by 3,200 votes, a surprising result given the size of the Tory wave, and became leader of the opposition. He was the only Liberal MP from British Columbia, and one of only two from west of Ontario. The Liberals, amid their worst showing in party history and led by an unpopular Turner, were said by some pundits to be following the British Liberals into oblivion. Though the Liberals had not fared much better in the 1958 election, they had clearly emerged as the main opposition party back then. After the 1984 election, however, the NDP were not far behind with 30 seats. Their leader Ed Broadbent consistently outpolled Turner and even Mulroney, except in Quebec.\nThe Liberals responded by using their large Senate majority, built up over years of Liberal majorities in the Commons, to stall Mulroney's legislation. In addition, a group of young Liberal MPs, known as the \"Rat Pack\", pestered Mulroney at every turn. The group included Sheila Copps, Brian Tobin, Don Boudria, and John Nunziata.\nTurner's leadership was frequently questioned, and in the lead up to the 1986 Liberal convention, a vote of confidence loomed large. The popular Jean Chr\u00e9tien resigned his seat, creating a stir in caucus. Keith Davey publicly voiced his concerns with Turner's leadership, which coincided with backroom struggles involving Chr\u00e9tien's supporters. The public conflict is said to have influenced many Liberals to support Turner, and he ended up getting a little over 75% of the delegate vote.\nThe Liberals faced more internal conflict in the next few years, but polls frequently had them in front of the Progressive Conservatives (but with Turner last in preferred prime minister categories). The upcoming Canada\u2013US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Meech Lake Accord threatened to divide the party until Turner took the position of being pro-Meech Lake and against the FTA. Turner asked the Liberal Senators to hold off on passing the legislation to implement the agreement until an election was held. It was later revealed that Mulroney planned to have an election called, anyway.\n1988 federal election.\nWhen the election was called for November 21, 1988, the Liberals had some early struggles, notably during one day in Montreal where 3 different costs were given for the proposed Liberal daycare program. The campaign was also hampered by a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report that stated there was a movement in the backroom to replace Turner with Chr\u00e9tien.\nTurner campaigned rallying support against the proposed FTA, an agreement that he said would lead to the abandonment of Canada's political sovereignty to the United States. His performance in the debate and his attacks on Mulroney and the FTA, where he accused the Progressive Conservative Prime Minister of selling Canada out with one signature of a pen, raised his poll numbers, and soon the Liberals were hoping for a majority. This prompted the Progressive Conservatives to stop the relatively calm campaign they had been running, and follow Allan Gregg's suggestion of \"bombing the bridge\" that joined anti-FTA voters and the Liberals, Turner's credibility. The ads focused on Turner's leadership struggles, and combined with over $6\u00a0million in pro-FTA ads, stopped Turner's momentum. Also not helping the Liberals was that the NDP had opposed the FTA as well (though not as vocally); this likely resulted in vote-splitting between the opposition parties. Although most Canadians voted for parties opposed to free trade, the Tories were returned with a majority government, and implemented the deal.\nThe Liberals more than doubled their representation to 83 seats, and kept their role as the Official Opposition; the NDP had also made gains but finished a distant third with 43 seats. The Progressive Conservatives won a reduced majority government with 169 seats.\nThe election loss seemed to confirm Turner's fate; he announced he was standing down from the party leadership in May 1989, officially resigning in June 1990. Turner resigned as Official Opposition leader, while still holding the Liberal leadership, so Herb Gray became the caucus leader in the interim. Chr\u00e9tien won that year's leadership convention over Paul Martin. Although not officially endorsed by Turner himself, Martin was widely the favourite of Turner's supporters.\nTurner continued to represent Vancouver Quadra in the House of Commons before retiring from politics in the 1993 election.\nAfter politics.\nIn 1990, Turner returned to practising law, this time working for Miller Thomson LLP, while he continued serving as an MP for another three years. He eventually became head of the firm's scholarship program. Turner was also a board member for several corporations.\nTurner was a member of the Canadian delegation that monitored the runoff vote in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election.\nTurner voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organization which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.\nIn 2017, he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. Turner lived in the Deer Park neighbourhood of Toronto.\nDeath and state funeral.\nTurner died on September 19, 2020, at age 91, from congestive heart failure. A state funeral was held for Turner on October 6, 2020, at St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica in Toronto. The ceremony was scaled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic with masking and social distancing protocols in place, attendance limited to 160 guests, with no lying in state. Turner was buried in a private service at Mount Pleasant Cemetery. Turner and Mackenzie King are two former Prime Ministers interred at Mount Pleasant.\nHonours.\nAccording to Canadian protocol, as a former prime minister, he was styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life.\nTurner was ranked 18th out of the first 20 Prime Ministers of Canada (through Jean Chr\u00e9tien) by a survey of Canadian historians in 1999. The survey was used in the book \"Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders\" by J. L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer.\nTurner was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on October 19, 1994, and was invested on May 3, 1995. His citation reads: He became Canada's seventeenth Prime Minister, crowning a distinguished parliamentary career during which he held several key Cabinet portfolios. Parallel to his political life, he has been a respected member of the law profession and supporter of many charitable organizations, in particular Mount Sinai Hospital and the Community Foundation of Toronto. His passion for his country is admired by all Canadians.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

He then moved to Montreal and gained prominence as a labour lawyer. He ran for leader of the Progressive Conservative party in 1976, placing third. In 1977, he was appointed as president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada. He held that post until 1983, when he became leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. Mulroney led the party to a landslide victory in the 1984 federal election, winning the second-largest percentage of seats in Canadian history (at 74.8%) and receiving over 50% of the popular vote. He and his party won a second majority government in 1988.\nMulroney's tenure as prime minister was marked by the introduction of major economic reforms, such as the Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the goods and services tax (GST) that was created to replace the manufacturers' sales tax, and the privatization of 23 of 61 of Canada's Crown corporations, including Air Canada and Petro-Canada. Mulroney attempted to secure Quebec's endorsement of the 1982 constitutional amendments through the Meech Lake Accord and then the Charlottetown Accord. Both proposed recognizing Quebec as a distinct society, extending provincial powers, and extensively changing the Canadian constitution; however, the accords failed to be ratified, and the Meech Lake Accord's demise revived Quebec separatism and resulted in the formation of the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois. Mulroney's government also faced criticism for its response to the Air India Flight 182 bombing, the largest mass killing in Canadian history. It later signed the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement following a referendum, which led to the creation of the territory of Nunavut. In foreign policy, Mulroney strengthened Canada's ties with the United States, ordered military intervention in the Gulf War, and took a leading role in mobilizing Commonwealth sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. Mulroney made environmental protection a priority by securing a treaty with the United States on acid rain, making Canada the first developed country to ratify the Convention on Biological Diversity, adding eight national parks, and enacting legislation, including the 1988 \"Environmental Protection Act\" and the 1992 \"Environmental Assessment Act\".\nThe unpopularity of the GST and the controversy surrounding its passage in the Senate, combined with the early 1990s recession, the prevalence of Canada's chronic budget deficit, the collapse of the Charlottetown Accord, and the rise of the Bloc and the Reform Party (the latter a result of growing Western alienation), caused a stark decline in Mulroney's popularity. He resigned in June 1993 and was replaced by his cabinet minister Kim Campbell. In the election later that year, the Progressive Conservatives were reduced from a parliamentary caucus of 156 to two, with its support being eroded by the Bloc and Reform parties. In his retirement, Mulroney served as an international business consultant and sat on the board of directors of multiple corporations. Although he places above average in rankings of Canadian prime ministers, his legacy remains controversial. He was criticized for his role in the resurgence of Quebec nationalism and accused of corruption in the Airbus affair, a scandal which came to light only several years after he left office.\nEarly life (1939\u20131955).\nMulroney was born on March 20, 1939, in Baie-Comeau, Quebec, a remote and isolated town of the C\u00f4te-Nord region, in the eastern part of the province. He was the son of Irish Canadian Catholic parents, Mary Irene (n\u00e9e O'Shea) and Benedict Martin Mulroney, who was a paper mill electrician. As there was no English-language Catholic high school in Baie-Comeau, Mulroney completed his high school education at a Roman Catholic boarding school in Chatham, New Brunswick, operated by St. Thomas University. In 2001, St. Thomas University named its newest academic building in his honour. Benedict Mulroney worked overtime and ran a repair business to earn extra money for his children's education, and he encouraged his oldest son to attend university.\nMulroney would frequently tell stories about newspaper publisher Robert R. McCormick, whose company had founded Baie-Comeau. Mulroney would sing Irish songs for McCormick, and the publisher would slip him $50. Mulroney grew up speaking English and French fluently.\nFamily.\nOn May 26, 1973, Mulroney married Mila Pivni\u010dki, the daughter of a Serbian-Canadian doctor, Dimitrije Pivni\u010dki, from Novi Be\u010dej. Many PC campaign buttons featured both Mulroney's face and hers, and Ontario premier Bill Davis commented to Brian, \"Mila will get you more votes for you than you will for yourself.\"\nThe Mulroneys have four children:\nEducation (1955\u20131964).\nMulroney entered St. Francis Xavier University in the fall of 1955 as a 16-year-old first-year student. His political life began when he was recruited to the campus Progressive Conservative group by Lowell Murray and others early in his first year. Murray, who was appointed to the Senate of Canada in 1979, became Mulroney's close friend, mentor, and adviser. Mulroney made other important, lasting friendships with Gerald Doucet, Fred Doucet, Sam Wakim, and Patrick MacAdam. Mulroney enthusiastically embraced political organization and assisted the local PC candidate in his successful 1956 Nova Scotia provincial election campaign; the PCs, led provincially by Robert Stanfield, won a surprise victory.\nMulroney became a youth delegate and attended the 1956 leadership convention in Ottawa. While initially undecided, Mulroney was captivated by John Diefenbaker's powerful oratory and easy approachability. Mulroney joined the Youth for Diefenbaker committee, which was led by Ted Rogers, a future scion of Canadian business. Mulroney struck an early friendship with Diefenbaker (who won the leadership) and received telephone calls from him.\nMulroney won several public speaking contests at St. Francis Xavier University, was a star member of the school's debating team, and never lost an inter-university debate. He was also very active in campus politics, serving with distinction in several model parliaments, and was campus prime minister in a Maritimes-wide Model Parliament in 1958.\nMulroney assisted with the 1958 national election campaign at the local level in Nova Scotia. This campaign led to the largest majority in the history of the Canadian House of Commons. After graduating from St. Francis Xavier with a degree in political science in 1959, Mulroney at first pursued a law degree from Dalhousie Law School in Halifax. It was around this time that Mulroney also cultivated friendships with the Tory premier of Nova Scotia, Robert Stanfield, and his chief adviser Dalton Camp. In his role as an advance man, Mulroney assisted with Stanfield's successful 1960 re-election campaign. Mulroney neglected his studies, fell seriously ill during the winter term, was hospitalized, and, despite getting extensions for several courses because of his illness, left his program at Dalhousie after the first year. He then applied to Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City and continued his legal studies there later in 1960.\nIn Quebec City, Mulroney befriended future Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson Sr. and frequented the provincial legislature, making connections with politicians, aides, and journalists. At Laval, Mulroney built a network of friends, including Lucien Bouchard, Bernard Roy, Michel Cogger, Michael Meighen, and Jean Bazin, that would play a prominent role in Canadian politics for years to come.\nMulroney secured a temporary appointment in Ottawa during the summer of 1962 as the executive assistant to Alvin Hamilton, minister of agriculture. Then, a federal election was called. Hamilton took Mulroney with him on the campaign trail, where the young organizer gained valuable experience.\nLabour lawyer (1964\u20131976).\nAfter graduating from Laval in 1964, Mulroney moved to Montreal to join the law firm Howard, Cate, Ogilvy et al. The firm at the time was the largest law firm in the Commonwealth of Nations. Despite twice failing his bar exams, the firm kept him due to his charming personality. Mulroney finally passed the exam and was admitted to the Quebec bar in 1965, after which he began practising as a labour lawyer. He worked on Laurent Picard's Commission of Inquiry on the St. Lawrence Ports. He was noted for ending several strikes along the Montreal waterfront, where he met fellow lawyer W. David Angus of Stikeman Elliott, who would later become a valuable fundraiser for his campaigns. In addition, he met fellow then Stikeman Elliott lawyer Stanley Hartt, who later played a vital role assisting him during his political career as Mulroney's Chief of Staff.\nIn 1966, Dalton Camp, who by then was president of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay out of the spotlight. With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a 1967 leadership convention in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister E. Davie Fulton. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to Robert Stanfield, who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.\nMulroney's professional reputation was further enhanced when he ended a strike that was considered impossible to resolve at the Montreal newspaper \"La Presse\". In doing so, Mulroney and the paper's owner, Canadian business mogul Paul Desmarais, became friends. After his initial difficulties, Mulroney's reputation in his firm steadily increased, and he was made a partner in 1971.\nMulroney's big break came during the Cliche Commission in 1974, which was set up by Quebec premier Robert Bourassa to investigate the situation at the James Bay Project, Canada's largest hydroelectric project. Violence and dirty tactics had broken out as part of a union accreditation struggle. To ensure the commission was non-partisan, Bourassa, the Liberal premier, placed Robert Cliche, a former leader of the provincial New Democratic Party in charge. Cliche asked Mulroney, a Progressive Conservative and a former student of his, to join the commission. Mulroney asked Lucien Bouchard to join as counsel. The committee's proceedings, which showed Mafia infiltration of the unions, made Mulroney well known in Quebec, as the hearings were extensively covered in the media. The Cliche Commission's report was largely adopted by the Bourassa government. A notable incident included the revelation that the controversy may have involved the office of the Premier of Quebec when it emerged that Paul Desrochers, Bourassa's special executive assistant, had met with the union boss Andr\u00e9 Desjardins, known as the \"King of Construction,\" to ask for his help with winning a by-election in exchange guaranteeing that only companies employing workers from his union would work on the James Bay project. Although Bouchard favoured calling in Robert Bourassa as a witness, Mulroney refused, deeming it a violation of 'executive privilege.' Mulroney and Bourassa would later cultivate a friendship that would turn out to be extremely beneficial when Mulroney ran for re-election in 1988.\n1976 Progressive Conservative leadership election.\nThe Stanfield-led Progressive Conservatives lost the 1974 election to the Pierre Trudeau-led Liberals, leading to Stanfield's resignation as leader. Mulroney, despite never having run for elected office, entered the contest to replace him. Mulroney and provincial rival Claude Wagner were both seen as potentially able to improve the party's standing in Quebec, which had supported the federal Liberals for decades. Mulroney had played the lead role in recruiting Wagner to the PC party a few years earlier, and the two wound up as rivals for Quebec delegates, most of whom were snared by Wagner, who even blocked Mulroney from becoming a voting delegate at the convention. In the leadership race, Mulroney spent an estimated $500,000, far more than the other candidates, and earned himself the nickname 'Cadillac candidate.' At the 1976 leadership convention, Mulroney placed second on the first ballot behind Wagner. His expensive campaign, slick image, lack of parliamentary experience, and vague policy positions did not endear him to many delegates, and he was unable to build upon his base support, being overtaken by eventual winner Joe Clark on the second ballot. Mulroney was the only one of the eleven leadership candidates who did not provide full financial disclosure on his campaign expenses, and his campaign finished deeply in debt.\nBusiness leadership (1976\u20131983).\nMulroney took the job of executive vice president of the Iron Ore Company of Canada, a joint subsidiary of three major U.S. steel corporations. Mulroney earned a salary well into the six-figure range. In 1977, he was appointed company president. Drawing upon his labour law experience, he instituted improved labour relations, and, with commodity prices on the rise, company profits soared during the next several years. In 1983, Mulroney successfully negotiated the closing of the Schefferville mine, winning a generous settlement for the affected workers. In the wake of his loss in the 1976 leadership race, Mulroney battled alcohol abuse and depression for several years; he credits his loyal wife Mila with helping him recover. In 1979, he permanently became a teetotaller. During his IOC term, he made liberal use of the company's executive jet, frequently flying business associates and friends on fishing trips. Mulroney also maintained and expanded his extensive political networking among business leaders and conservatives across the country. As his business reputation grew, he was invited onto several corporate boards.\nOpposition leader (1983\u20131984).\nJoe Clark led the Progressive Conservative party to a minority government in the 1979 federal election, ending 16 years of continuous Liberal rule. Clark's government fell after a successful no-confidence motion over the budget in December 1979. The PCs subsequently lost the federal election held two months later to Trudeau and the Liberals. Many Tories were also annoyed with Clark over his slowness in dispensing patronage appointments after he became prime minister in June 1979. By late 1982, Joe Clark's leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was being questioned in many party circles and among many Tory members of Parliament, despite his solid national lead over prime minister Pierre Trudeau in opinion polls.\nMulroney, while publicly endorsing Clark at a press conference in 1982, organized behind the scenes to defeat him at the party's leadership review. Clark's key Quebec organizer, Rodrigue Pageau, was actually a double agent working for Mulroney, undermining Clark's support. When Clark received an endorsement by only 66.9 percent of delegates at the party convention in January 1983 in Winnipeg, he resigned and ran to regain his post at the 1983 leadership convention. Despite still not being a member of Parliament, Mulroney ran against him, campaigning more shrewdly than he had done seven years before. Mulroney had been criticized in 1976 for lacking policy depth and substance, a weakness he addressed by making several major speeches across the country in the early 1980s, which were collected into a book, \"Where I Stand\", published in 1983.\nMulroney also avoided most of the flash of his earlier campaign, for which he had been criticized. Mulroney was elected party leader on June 11, 1983, beating Clark on the fourth ballot, attracting broad support from the many factions of the party and especially from representatives of his native Quebec. Pundits noted that a poll of delegates on the final ballot showed that Mulroney had won a bare majority of Clark's home province of Alberta and that Clark had won a bare majority in Mulroney's home province of Quebec. Mulroney's strong showing amongst Ontario delegates (65 percent to 35 percent) seemed to account for most of his margin of victory. A \"New York Times\" article from 1984 argued that Mulroney was elected from \"the right-wing elements\" within the party. Tasha Kheiriddin, writing in \"La Presse\", argued that \"Brian Mulroney's injuries to Joe Clark in 1983 took more than 15 years to heal, as various factions continued to compete for leadership roles in the field and youth wings.\"\nTwo months later, Mulroney entered Parliament as the MP for Central Nova in Nova Scotia, winning a by-election in what was then considered a safe Tory seat after Elmer MacKay stood aside in his favour. The Progressive Conservatives only had one seat in Mulroney's home province of Quebec.\nThroughout his political career, Mulroney's fluency in English and French, with Quebec roots in both cultures, gave him an advantage that eventually proved decisive.\nBy the start of 1984, as Mulroney began learning the realities of parliamentary life in the House of Commons, the Tories took a substantial lead in opinion polling. It was almost taken for granted that Trudeau would be heavily defeated by Mulroney in the general election due no later than 1985. Trudeau announced his retirement in February and was succeeded as Liberal leader and prime minister by his former finance minister, John Turner, in June. The Liberals then surged in the polls to take a lead after trailing by more than 20 percentage points. Only four days after being sworn in as prime minister, Turner called a general election for September. But the Liberal election campaign machinery was in disarray, leading to a weak campaign.\nIn the early days of the campaign, Mulroney made several gaffes regarding patronage, insulting ambassador Bryce Mackasey with the phrase \"there's no whore like an old whore\". Most of the campaign is best remembered for his attacks on a raft of Liberal patronage appointments. In his final days in office, Trudeau had controversially appointed a flurry of senators, judges, and executives on various governmental and crown corporation boards, widely seen as a way to offer 'plum jobs' to loyal members of the Liberal party. Upon assuming office, Turner had been under pressure to advise governor general Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 to cancel the appointments\u2014which convention would then have required Sauv\u00e9 to do. Turner did not, instead appointing several more Liberals to prominent political offices per a signed legal agreement with Trudeau.\nTurner had planned to attack Mulroney over the patronage machine that the latter had set up in anticipation of victory. In a televised leaders' debate, Turner launched what appeared to be the start of a blistering attack on Mulroney by comparing his patronage machine to that of the old Union Nationale in Quebec. Mulroney successfully turned the tables by pointing to the recent raft of Liberal patronage appointments. He demanded that Turner apologize to the country for making \"these horrible appointments.\" Turner replied that, \"I had no option\" except to let the appointments stand. Mulroney famously responded:\nYou had an option, sir. You could have said, 'I am not going to do it. This is wrong for Canada, and I am not going to ask Canadians to pay the price.' You had an option, sir\u2014to say 'no'\u2014and you chose to say 'yes' to the old attitudes and the old stories of the Liberal Party. That, sir, if I may say respectfully, is not good enough for Canadians.\nTurner froze and wilted under this withering riposte from Mulroney. He could repeat only, \"I had no option.\" A visibly angry Mulroney called this \"an avowal of failure\" and \"a confession of non-leadership.\" The exchange led most papers the next day, with most of them paraphrasing Mulroney's counterattack as \"You had an option, sir\u2014you could have said 'no.'\" Many observers believe that at this point, Mulroney assured himself of becoming prime minister.\nOn September 4, Mulroney and the Tories won the second largest majority government in terms of percentage of seats in Canadian history, winning 74.8 percent of seats in the House of Commons; the 1958 election had seen the Tories win 78.5 percent of seats. Mulroney's government took 211 seats, three more than their previous record in 1958 and the highest number ever won by any party in Canadian history. The Liberals won only 40 seats, which, at the time, was their worst performance ever and the worst defeat for a governing party at the federal level in Canadian history. The Progressive Conservatives won just over half of the popular vote (compared to 53.4 percent in 1958) and led in every province, emerging as a national party for the first time since 1958. Especially important was the Tories' performance in Mulroney's home province, Quebec. The Tories had only won the most seats in that province once since 1896 \u2013 the 1958 Tory landslide. Largely out of anger at Trudeau and Mulroney's promise of a new deal for Quebec, the province swung over dramatically to support him. The Tories had only won one seat out of 75 in 1980 but took 58 seats in 1984. Mulroney yielded Central Nova back to MacKay and instead ran and won in the eastern Quebec riding of Manicouagan, which included Baie-Comeau.\nIn 1984, the Canadian Press named Mulroney \"Newsmaker of the Year\" for the second straight year, making him only the second prime minister to have received the honour both before becoming prime minister and when prime minister (the other being Lester Pearson).\nPrime Minister (1984\u20131993).\nThe first Conservative majority victory in 26 years\u2014and only the second in 54 years\u2014initially seemed to give Mulroney a very formidable position. The Tories had won just over half the popular vote, and no other party crossed the 50-seat mark. Although it appeared as though he had wide discretion to take Canada in virtually any direction he wanted, his position was far more precarious than his parliamentary majority would suggest. Mulroney's support was based on a grand coalition of socially conservative populists from the West, Quebec nationalists, and fiscal conservatives from Ontario and Atlantic Canada. Such diverse interests became difficult for him to juggle as the years went on, and would eventually lead to the collapse of the grand coalition entirely in 1993.\nMost of Mulroney's ministers had little government experience, resulting in conflicts of interest and embarrassing scandals. Many Tories expected patronage appointments due to the long time out of government. Mulroney included a large number of Westerners in his Cabinet (including Clark as minister of external affairs). He was not completely successful, even aside from economic and constitutional policy. For example, he moved CF-18 servicing from Manitoba to Quebec in 1986, even though the Manitoba bid was lower and the company was better rated. Mulroney also received death threats for exerting pressure on Manitoba over French language rights.\nEconomic policy.\nSocial programs and spending.\nDespite Mulroney referring to social programs as a \"sacred trust\" when he was Opposition leader in 1983, he began to reduce expenditures on the programs when he came into office. In terms of old age security, Mulroney's government gradually reduced its benefits at middle-income levels and above. Mulroney's government cut spending for unemployment insurance (UI) and reduced the range of workers covered by the benefits from the program. In their first budget in 1985, the Mulroney government announced that registered home ownership savings plan (RHOSP) contributions would not be deductible if made after May 22, 1985, (funds left in the RHOSP after this date could be withdrawn tax-free, \"regardless of the use\") and no contribution could be made after December 31, 1985; the government also announced that income earned in an RHOSP after December 31, 1985, was to be included in the owner's taxable income, effectively ending the last desirable feature of RHOSPs. In 1990, the government limited cost-sharing under the Canada Assistance Plan in three provinces in response to their concerns that unemployed workers would apply for cost-shared provincial social assistance (as a result of rising unemployment). Also in 1990, Mulroney's government eliminated its financial contribution to UI, making all UI costs covered by worker and employer contributions. In Spring 1993, the government lowered benefits for unemployed Canadians and eliminated benefits for the unemployed who failed to prove the reason they left their job.\nIn 1985, Mulroney's government introduced a four-year plan to restructure family benefits. Starting in 1986, family allowances were partially indexed to the cost of living. For three years, from 1986 to 1988, the refundable child tax credits were increased to $549 per year. Starting in 1989, the tax credits were partially indexed in the same manner as family allowances. That same year, as part of the government's program to target social benefits to low or middle-income Canadians, universal family allowances ended as high-income parents were required to repay all of their benefits at tax-filing time. This system maintained and increased a tax deduction for childcare expenses, benefiting high-income families the most. In 1992, the government replaced family allowances with a new Child Tax Benefit that included the family allowance, the Refundable Child Tax Credit, and a non-refundable child tax credit. The new benefit paid a maximum of $85 per month per child up to the age of 18 and was tax-free. It was income-tested on the net family income reported in the preceding year's income tax returns.\nMulroney's government reduced the federal workforce by 1 percent each year from 1986 to 1991, resulting in the laying off of 11,000 federal employees. Mulroney's government transferred a significantly increased share of the costs of universal health care and higher education to the provinces, departing from the previous standard of cost-sharing of the two levels of government. As a result, some provinces had to drop insurance coverage for certain medical procedures and drugs. Mulroney's government eliminated subsidies to government-owned passenger rail and postal services, resulting in the closing of post offices in some small towns and the elimination of certain train routes. The government also introduced fees for forwarding misdirected letters. Under Mulroney, military spending growth was reduced to 1.5 percent per year and foreign aid growth was reduced to 3 percent per year. Mulroney also put spending limits on medicare.\nDeficit.\nOne of Mulroney's priorities was to lower the deficit, which under Pierre Trudeau had increased from $667 million in the 1968 budget to $37.2 billion in the 1984 budget. By 1988, Mulroney's government cut the deficit to $28 billion, though it would never decrease beyond that point and the deficit would instead increase. The Progressive Conservatives' final budget in 1993 produced a deficit of $38.5 billion, about the same level that it was when Trudeau left office. As a percent of GDP, the deficit was reduced from 8.3 percent to 5.6 percent during Mulroney's tenure.\nThe worldwide recession of the early 1990s significantly damaged the government's financial situation. Mulroney's inability to improve the government's finances, as well as his use of tax increases to deal with it, were major factors in alienating the Western conservative portion of his power base \u2013 this contrasted with his tax cuts earlier as part of his 'pro-business' plan which had increased the deficit. At the same time, the Bank of Canada began to raise interest rates in order to meet a zero inflation target; the experiment was regarded as a failure that exacerbated the effect of the recession in Canada. Annual budget deficits ballooned to record levels, reaching $42 billion in his last year of office. These deficits grew the national debt dangerously close to the psychological benchmark of 100 percent of GDP, further weakening the Canadian dollar and damaging Canada's international credit rating.\nTaxation.\nMulroney's government de-indexed personal income tax brackets and eliminated open corporate tax loopholes. The government also increased taxes on alcohol, tobacco and gasoline. In 1988, Mulroney's government reduced the corporate income tax from 36 percent to 28 percent. That year, his government increased the capital gains tax inclusion rate from 50 percent to 66.67 percent before increasing it to 75 percent in 1990.\nMulroney's government passed a major tax reform bill, Bill C-139, which was made effective on January 1, 1988. It included reforms for personal and corporate income taxes. The bill expanded the tax base for personal and corporate income; lowered rates applicable to taxable income; supplanted exemptions with credits; and removed certain deductions for personal income tax. The bill replaced the 1987 rate schedule of 10 brackets (with rates ranging from 6 to 34 percent) with a schedule of only three brackets (with rates of 17 percent, 26 percent, and 29 percent). The bill also limited the lifetime capital gains exemption to $100,000; lowered capital cost allowances; established limitations on deductible business expenses; and cut the dividend tax credit.\nIn August 1989, Mulroney's government announced the introduction of a nine percent national sales tax, the goods and services tax (GST), to replace the hidden 13.5 percent manufacturers' sales tax (MST). The government argued that the MST damaged the Canadian economy's competitiveness as it only applied to domestically manufactured goods, as opposed to the new GST, which applied to domestic and imported goods. The GST did not apply to basic groceries, prescription drugs, health and dental care, educational services, daycare, and legal aid. Following public backlash, Mulroney's government reduced the tax to seven percent. Although the government argued GST was not a tax increase, but a tax shift, its visibility made it extremely unpopular, and many polls showed that as many as 80 percent of Canadians opposed it. Two Progressive Conservative MPs from Alberta, David Kilgour and Alex Kindy, left the party in protest of the tax. The Senate with a Liberal majority refused to pass the GST. Mulroney used Section 26 (the Deadlock Clause), a little-known Constitutional provision, allowing him in an emergency situation to ask the Queen to appoint eight new senators. On September 27, 1990, with the Queen's approval, Mulroney added the eight new senators, giving the Tories their first majority in the Senate in nearly 50 years. In December 1990, the GST was passed in the Senate and was made effective on January 1, 1991. Mulroney's use of an emergency clause was controversial and contributed to his decline in popularity.\nOne of the causes of the early 1990s recession was several tax increases instituted by Mulroney's government between 1989 and 1991. The introduction of the goods and services tax and increases related to excise and payroll taxes were modelled to have reduced real GDP growth by 1.6, 2.4 and 5.1 percentage points in 1990, 1991 and 1992, respectively. Had these tax increases not been implemented, the national debt would have increased significantly.\nPrivatizations.\nMulroney's government privatized many of Canada's Crown corporations. In 1984, the Government of Canada held 61 Crown corporations. Under Mulroney, it sold off 23 of them, including Air Canada, which was completely privatized by 1989, although the \"Air Canada Public Participation Act\" continued to make certain requirements of the airline. Mulroney's government also privatized Connaught Laboratories in 1984 through two public issues (one in 1984 and one in 1987) and Petro-Canada in 1991.\nEnergy policy.\nOn June 1, 1985, Mulroney's government negotiated the Western Accord on Energy with the governments of the oil-producing provinces. It permitted the full deregulation of oil prices and allowed the market forces of international and local supply and demand to determine prices. This accord abolished the National Energy Program, which was a policy of Trudeau's Liberal government that was highly unpopular in the Western provinces.\nEnvironmental policy.\nThe environment was a key focus of Mulroney's government. His government added eight new national parks (including Bruce Peninsula and South Moresby), and passed the \"Canadian Environmental Assessment Act\" and \"Canadian Environmental Protection Act\".\nIn 1987, Mulroney hosted an international climate conference in Montreal, Quebec. There, 46 nations signed the Montreal Protocol to limit the use and production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); this agreement came after the discovery that CFCs were burning a hole through the ozone layer.\nMulroney secured the U.S.\u2013Canada Air Quality Agreement, an environmental treaty on acid rain, with United States president George H. W. Bush in 1991. Both nations committed to reducing the emissions of the air pollutants (sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide) that caused acid rain through a cap-and-trade system. Negotiations began in 1986 when Mulroney first discussed the issue with then-president Ronald Reagan. Mulroney repeatedly pressed the issue in public meetings with Reagan in 1987 and 1988.\nUnder Mulroney, Canada became the first industrialized country to ratify the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Conference experts claimed that Canada's signing of the treaty motivated the United Kingdom and Germany to pledge their support and thus avoid the convention's defeat. The conference also introduced the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to an environmentally friendly level; Canada was the first Group of Seven (G7) nation to sign the treaty. At the convention, Mulroney pledged $260 million from Canada toward advancing sustainable development for developing nations; this included an offer to forgive $145 million in debts owed to Canada by Latin American nations on the condition that the sum of money be used for sustainable development and social programs. At the end of the conference, Mulroney stated, \"I leave this conference believing we have a better chance of saving the world than we had when we came here.\"\nBy 1992, Newfoundland and Labrador cod of breeding age dropped to one percent of its estimated peak. Concerned about the overfishing of cod stocks off the coast of the province, Mulroney's government, in the summer of that year imposed a moratorium on cod fishing; they initially set the ban for a minimum of two years, but later extended it indefinitely. This resulted in the layoff of 30,000\u201340,000 workers. Mulroney's government introduced the Northern Cod Adjustment and Recovery Program (NCARP) that provided unemployment insurance payments and retraining to workers; most of the workers viewed this as insufficient. In the first decade of the ban, Newfoundland and Labrador's population fell by 10 percent as people left to search for work.\nSocial policy.\nOn September 22, 1988, Mulroney issued an official apology on behalf of the Canadian government for Japanese Canadian internment during World War II. Mulroney's government provided a 300 million dollar compensation package, which included $21,000 to each of the remaining 13,000 survivors, $12 million for a Japanese community fund, and $24 million to create a Canadian race relations foundation.\nMulroney argues he set up the Desch\u00eanes Commission of inquiry on Nazi war criminals soon after he was first elected in 1984, even though it was controversial among \"communities where Nazi criminals posed as respectable citizens.\"\nOn issues of abortion, Mulroney declared he was opposed to \"abortion on demand\" but gave no details on what that meant legally. In the Spring of 1988, the Mulroney government offered a compromise solution that would give easy access to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and criminalize late-term ones. The law in the House of Commons was defeated 147 to 76 in a free vote, voted against by both MPs who opposed easy access to abortions and those who opposed adding any abortion rules to the criminal code. Some pro-life social conservatives who played a role in Mulroney's 1984 landslide were disappointed by this move, as they were in favour of outlawing abortion completely, regardless of the circumstance. In 1989, the government introduced a much stricter bill. If enacted, it would ban all abortions unless a doctor ruled the woman's life or health would be threatened. Anyone found in violation of the law could be imprisoned for up to two years. In another free vote, the House of Commons passed the new bill by nine votes. A few months later, the bill failed in the Senate on a tie vote. Under the rules of the Senate, a tie meant the measure was defeated. This was the last time the federal government attempted to enact abortion laws. Today, abortion in Canada remains completely legal at all stages of pregnancy, regardless of the reason.\nIn 1991, \"Frank\" magazine ran a satirical advertisement for a contest inviting young Tories to \"Deflower Caroline Mulroney.\" Her father was incensed and threatened physical harm toward those responsible before joining several women's groups in denouncing the ad as an incitement to rape on national television. Frank's editor Michael Bate, called the spoof, intended to mock her unpopular father for bringing her to public adult-oriented events, \"clumsy\" but had no regrets. Bate also shared sympathy toward her father's reaction over the spoof.\nAttempted constitutional reform.\nMeech Lake Accord.\nA major undertaking by Mulroney's government was an attempt to resolve the divisive issue of national unity. In 1981, Quebec premier Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque, leader of the Quebec nationalist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government, had been the only provincial premier not to agree to the package of constitutional amendments which patriated the Constitution of Canada. In the 1985 Quebec provincial election, the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois government suffered a landslide defeat to the Liberals led by Robert Bourassa. Some believed that the new Quebec government's moderate stance on nationalism would allow the province to formally endorse the constitution. Mulroney wanted Quebec to endorse the constitution and wanted to include Quebec in a new agreement with the rest of Canada. In August 1986, Mulroney met with provincial premiers in Edmonton, Alberta, where the ministers agreed to the \"Edmonton Declaration\". It stated that a \"Quebec Round\" of constitutional talks based on Bourassa's five conditions that would have to be met for Quebec's endorsement of the constitution (recognition of Quebec's distinct character (Quebec being historically Catholic and majority French-speaking); a veto for Quebec in constitutional matters; input from Quebec into the appointment of Supreme Court justices; entrenchment of Quebec's role in immigration; and a limit on the federal spending power) would occur before further reforms would be undertaken.\nMulroney called a First Ministers' conference with the ten provincial premiers for April 30, 1987, at Willson House, located on the shores of Meech Lake, Quebec, in the Gatineau Hills. During the conference, Mulroney negotiated the Meech Lake Accord, a package of constitutional amendments designed to satisfy Quebec's demand for recognition as a \"distinct society\" within Canada. The accord also devolved some powers to the provinces such as giving provinces a role in nominating people to serve in some federal institutions (e.g. the Senate and Supreme Court of Canada); allowing provinces to withdraw from federally-financed social programs on the conditions that the province establish its own program that meets national standards; giving constitutional status to federal\u2013provincial immigration agreements; and mandating annual First Ministers' conferences (the accord also required that Senate reform and fisheries be discussed at the conferences), which made the federal-provincial consultative process constitutional. At a final roll call at 4:45\u00a0a.m. on June 3, 1987, hours before the signing ceremony, Mulroney knowingly breached convention by taking the vote in reverse order around the table instead of the traditional order of a province's entry into confederation. At the symbolic signing ceremony, the premiers signed the Accord. The agreement would have changed the constitution's amending formula. It therefore needed to be ratified by the federal parliament and the legislatures of all ten provinces. As well, other parts of the accord were made under the general amendment provision. That meant that there was a three-year deadline for those amendments to pass. On June 23, 1987, Quebec became the first province to approve of the Accord, triggering the three-year time limit provided for by the Section 39(2) of the \"Constitution Act, 1982\"; this meant that June 22, 1990, would be the last possible day the accord could pass.\nOpinion polls showed that a majority of Canadians supported the accord. Some believed the accord would weaken Quebec separatism. Critics believed the accord would weaken the federal government's authority, and some from English Canada worried the \"distinct society\" clause would give Quebec special status to the detriment of the other nine provinces. Mulroney told the \"Toronto Star\", \"You can have the old style of warring federalism, or you can have genuine co-operative federalism, on which we're trying to build a new country.\" As criticism grew, support for the Accord declined outside of Quebec; some there feared its failure would spark a backlash in the province and damage national unity.\nA commission headed by Mulroney's former cabinet minister, Jean Charest, recommended a companion accord that would address the concerns of other provinces, assert that the distinct society clause would be subject to the charter, and would feature greater protections for minority language rights in the provinces. Mulroney's environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, viewed the companion accord as a betrayal of Meech and subsequently praised the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in a telegram. Mulroney reportedly demanded Bouchard clarify the remark or resign, and Bouchard supplied a lengthy letter of resignation on May 22, 1990. Mulroney claimed he fired Bouchard. Bouchard left the Progressive Conservatives soon afterward. After the failure of the Accord, Bouchard convinced several other Tories and Liberals to join him to form the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, a pro-sovereigntist party.\nIn early June 1990, all premiers finally agreed to ratify the accord provided there be further constitutional discussions revolving around an elected Senate, the amending formula, equality, and Indigenous issues. Around that time, New Brunswick agreed to ratify the agreement. Manitoba and, Newfoundland, and Labrador remained the only provinces to have not ratified it; they only had a few weeks left. Unanimous support from every member of the Manitoba Legislative Assembly was required to bypass the necessary public consultations in the assembly and proceed with ratification. On June 12, 1990, Member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba Elijah Harper announced his opposition to the Accord on the grounds that Indigenous groups had not been consulted. Harper's opposition prevented the amendment from proceeding; thus, the accord failed to pass in the legislature. This allowed the premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Clyde Wells (who revoked the province's previous assent though reluctantly agreed to ratify the accord in June 1990), to excuse himself from bringing the accord to a vote in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly. The accord failed to be ratified as Manitoba and Newfoundland and Labrador did not approve of it by the June 23, 1990, deadline.\nCharlottetown Accord.\nFollowing the Meech Lake failure, Mulroney sought a second attempt to get Quebec's endorsement of the constitution. He appointed his foreign minister, Joe Clark, as the first minister responsible for constitutional affairs on April 21, 1991. Clark was responsible for establishing a new accord to end the constitutional deadlock with Quebec. Mulroney's government appointed two Quebec bodies (the Allaire Committee and the Belanger-Campeau Committee) and two national bodies (the Beaudoin-Edwards Committee and the Spicer Commission) to engage in discussions regarding constitutional reform. These bodies generated various reports, including the federal document titled \"Shaping Canada's Future Together\". The Mulroney government then held five national conferences to discuss the proposals in the document. The conferences led to another federal report titled \"A Renewed Canada.\". Afterward, negotiations between the federal, provincial, and territorial governments occurred. Unlike the Meech Lake Accord, Indigenous peoples were included in the discussions. Quebec was included in the final stages. The negotiations culminated in the Charlottetown Accord, which was unveiled in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on August 28, 1992.\nThe accord gave provinces jurisdiction over forestry, mining, cultural affairs, and other areas; required the federal government to negotiate policy with the provinces in certain areas such as telecommunications, labour and training, regional development, and immigration; abolished disallowance (which gives the federal Cabinet power to overrule provincial legislation within one year of it being passed); and required provincial consent for the federal government gaining power over provincial infrastructure projects. The accord allowed provinces to create their own social programs and mandated the federal government to compensate provinces as long as the provincial social programs met national standards. It also mandated the federal government to compensate provinces that withdrew from any constitutional amendment that transferred provincial powers to the federal government; the compensation would allow provinces to fund their own programs. In addition, the accord addressed Indigenous self-government and contained the \"Canada Clause\" that determines Canadian values including egalitarianism, multiculturalism, and recognition of Quebec as a distinct society. Finally, the accord entrenched the structure and appointment process for the Supreme Court of Canada in the constitution; changed the Senate into a Triple-E Senate with reduced powers (such as requiring a majority of all senators and a majority of Francophone senators in certain votes); increased the number of seats in the House of Commons; guaranteed Quebec at least a quarter of the Commons's seats; and increased the number of matters that require unanimous approval for a constitutional amendment.\nThe accord was supported by the federal government and all ten provincial governments. Although it could have been ratified as a constitutional amendment, Mulroney's government insisted on holding a national referendum to avoid a repetition of the criticism that the Meech Lake Accord was agreed upon without public approval. On October 26, 1992, two referendums, one national (without Quebec) and one in Quebec, were held, asking if Canadians agreed with the Charlottetown Accord. Nationally, 54.3 percent opposed the accord. In Quebec, 56.7 percent opposed it. Many saw the accord's defeat as a protest against Mulroney's government, which was heavily unpopular due to the failure of the previous Meech Lake Accord, the introduction of the GST, and the early 1990s recession.\nForeign policy.\nAs prime minister, Mulroney strengthened Canada's relations with the United States, moving away from Pierre Trudeau's third option policy of reducing American influence on Canada. Mulroney established a close relationship with U.S. president Ronald Reagan. On March 17 and 18, 1985, the \"Shamrock Summit\" between Mulroney and Reagan was held in Quebec City. The summit gained its name from the two leaders' Irish background, and because the meeting started on St. Patrick's Day. In the summit, Mulroney and Reagan sang \"When Irish Eyes are Smiling\"; this signified the camaraderie between the two leaders and a turning point in Canada\u2013United States relations.\nThe Air India Flight 182 bombing, which originated in Montreal, occurred on June 23, 1985. This was the largest terrorist act before the September 11 attacks, with the majority of the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, sparking an uproar in Canada since he did not call the families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Furthermore, there were several warnings from the Indian government to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats toward Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented.\nIn November 1984, Mulroney sent his newly appointed Canadian ambassador to the United Nations, Stephen Lewis, to the Headquarters of the United Nations in New York City to persuade the General Assembly to take action against the ongoing Ethiopian famine. Days later, the UN and Red Cross launched an effort to save seven million starving Ethiopians and 22 million others in Africa. The Mulroney government's efforts to aid Ethiopia differed Canada from the United States and the United Kingdom, two Western nations which avoided taking action against the famine due to Ethiopia's Marxist regime. Mulroney's foreign affairs minister, Joe Clark, became the first senior Western official to visit Ethiopia during the famine, ahead of UN officials. Mulroney's government spent tens of millions of dollars to match private donations to combat the famine. Canada contributed to over 10 percent of international aid to Ethiopia. After the famine, Mulroney's government increased aid and development funding to Africa.\nOn December 2, 1991, Canada became the first Western nation to recognize Ukraine as an independent country, next day after the landslide referendum in favour of independence in Ukraine.\nApartheid.\nMulroney's government opposed the apartheid regime in South Africa. Beginning in 1985, Mulroney led an effort within the Commonwealth to sanction the South African government with the goal of pressuring them to end apartheid and release anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison. This put Mulroney at odds with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who opposed apartheid but believed the sanctions could harm Britain's economic ties to the country and cause unemployment in South Africa. United States President Ronald Reagan also opposed sanctions, believing that Mandela and other leaders of the African National Congress were communists. At an October 23, 1985, United Nations General Assembly meeting, Mulroney stated, \"if there is no progress in the dismantling of apartheid, [Canada]'s relations with South Africa may have to be severed completely\"; he restored this line in his speech after he originally removed it at the advice of External Affairs. After an August 1986 meeting in London, Canada, along with other Commonwealth nations, implemented 11 new sanctions on South Africa including bans on new air links, new investment, promotion of tourism, and imports of South African coal, metals and agricultural goods.\nThe day after Mandela was released on February 11, 1990, he spoke with Mulroney through the telephone, thanking him for his efforts to end apartheid. Mandela made the Parliament of Canada his first legislature in the world to make a speech. On June 18 that year, Mandela spoke in the House of Commons of Canada, where he thanked Mulroney and Canadians. The two remained in contact after they left politics; during his annual business trips to South Africa, Mulroney visited Mandela.\nFree trade and 1988 re-election.\nCritics noted that Mulroney had originally professed opposition to free trade during the 1983 leadership campaign though the 1985 report of the MacDonald Commission suggested free trade as an idea to him. Negotiations between Canada and the United States for a free trade treaty started in May 1986. In October 1987, a deal was reached; the Canada\u2013United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) stated that all tariffs between the two countries would be eliminated by 1998. This deal was achieved not least because of Mulroney's close relationship with U.S. president Ronald Reagan. This agreement was controversial; while Mulroney used his massive majority in the House of Commons to pass the bill, the Liberal-dominated Senate demanded an election before proceeding to a ratification vote. This induced Mulroney to ask governor general Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 on October 1 to dissolve Parliament and call an election for November 21.\nThe trade deal was the main issue of the election, with the Liberals and New Democratic Party (NDP) opposing it; Liberal leader John Turner (who was preparing for his second campaign after Mulroney defeated him in 1984) believed that the agreement would \"Americanize\" Canada and cost many Canadian jobs. A week after the October 25 debate, the Liberals were six points ahead of the PCs. To combat this Liberal surge, the PCs began running a more negative campaign, capitalizing on the perceived lack of public confidence in Turner, his perceived inability to lead the Liberal party, and arguing that he only opposed free trade because of political opportunism. The Progressive Conservatives' poll numbers began to rebound, and they were re-elected with a greatly reduced majority, winning 169 out of 295 seats and 43 percent of the popular vote. Mulroney became the first and only federal Canadian Conservative party leader since John A. Macdonald to lead his party to a second majority government. The trade deal gained the support of Quebec premier Robert Bourassa, which helped the PCs maintain their standing in Quebec. In this election, Mulroney transferred to another eastern Quebec seat, Charlevoix.\nAlso on November 21, Mulroney made a controversial Order in Council which allowed the establishment of the AMEX Bank of Canada (owned by American Express), despite finance minister Michael Wilson rejecting AMEX's application to open a Canadian bank in 1986. The Amex Bank of Canada started operating on July 1, 1990. Toronto-Dominion Bank chairman Richard Thomson accused Mulroney's government of favouritism toward Amex as its chief executive officer, James Robinson, supported free trade.\nThe government implemented the deal; it was made effective on January 1, 1989. In 1994, CUSFTA was replaced by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which now included Mexico.\nGulf War.\nIn the early 1990s, Mulroney played a vital part in upholding international law to stop Saddam Hussein's aggression in Kuwait. Along with ambassador Yves Fortier, Mulroney was instrumental in drafting UNSCR 678 which later led to the war when Iraq failed to heed the resolution, and Canada supported the armed UN coalition during the 1991 Gulf War through Operation SCIMITAR and Operation Friction . When the UN authorized full use of force in the operation, Canada sent a CF-18 squadron with support personnel and a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war as well as a company of The Royal Canadian Regiment to safeguard these ground elements. The Canadian Forces code-named Canada's participation Operation Friction. In August, Mulroney sent the destroyers HMCS \"Terra Nova\" and HMCS \"Athabaskan\" to enforce the trade blockade against Iraq. The supply ship HMCS \"Protecteur\" was also sent to aid the gathering coalition forces. When the air war began, Canada's planes were integrated into the coalition force and, provided air cover and attacked ground targets. This was the first time since the fighting on Cyprus in 1974 that Canadian forces participated directly in combat operations.\nUnpopularity and retirement.\nFracturing of electoral coalition.\nIn late 1987, the Western Canada-based right-wing populist Reform Party of Canada was founded. The creation of the party was motivated by Western Canadian discontent with Mulroney's government and the Progressive Conservatives in general. The Reform Party opposed the Mulroney government's promotion of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords as well as their introduction of the goods and services tax. Although the party won only 2 percent of the popular vote and no seats in the 1988 election, it won its first seat in the Commons on the May 6, 1989, by-election in the Alberta riding of Beaver River, where Reform candidate Deborah Grey defeated Progressive Conservative candidate Dave Broda by a nearly 20 percent margin. This was the first sign that Mulroney's coalition was fracturing; the PCs had dominated Alberta's federal politics since the 1958 election.\nIn June 1991, the pro-Quebec sovereigntist Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois was founded by Mulroney's former environment minister and Quebec lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard. The party's foundation was motivated by the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord, which would have benefited Quebec if it had been ratified. The party attracted a few other PC and Liberal members of parliament.\nResignation.\nWidespread public resentment of the goods and services tax, the early 1990s recession, the fracturing of his political coalition, and his lack of results regarding the Quebec situation caused Mulroney's popularity to decline severely during his second term. Mulroney entered 1993 facing a statutory general election. By this time, his approval ratings had dipped into the tens, and were at 12 percent in a 1992 Gallup poll, making him the most unpopular prime minister since opinion polling began in Canada in the 1940s.\nOn February 24, 1993, Mulroney announced his intention to resign as prime minister and retire from politics. In his announcement, Mulroney stated, \"Whether you agree with our solutions or not, none will accuse us, I think, of having chosen to evade our responsibilities by sidestepping the most controversial issues of our time.\" Mulroney claimed his resignation was not related to the consensus that he would be heavily defeated by Jean Chr\u00e9tien's Liberals if he led the Tories into the next election and rather argued he could defeat the Liberals if he sought another term. The last Gallup Poll taken before Mulroney's announcement of resignation showed the PCs' polling numbers had rebounded to 21 percent. In his final days in office, Mulroney conducted a European \"farewell\" tour using Canadian federal funds. On June 13, 1993, Mulroney was replaced as leader of the Progressive Conservatives by defence minister Kim Campbell. On June 25, 1993, Mulroney resigned as prime minister and chose not to run for reelection at the Commons.\nAftermath.\nIn the October 25, 1993 election, the Progressive Conservative party was reduced from 156 seats to two seats in the worst defeat ever suffered for a governing party at the federal level in Canada. The Tories were no longer recognized as an official caucus in the House of Commons since the required minimum number of seats for official party status is 12. As an example of the antipathy toward Mulroney, his former riding fell to the Bloc by a lopsided margin; the Tory candidate finished a distant third, with only 6,800 votes out of nearly 40,000 cast. The more right-wing Reform party won over alienated Western Canadians and replaced the PCs as the major conservative party in Canada; they won 52 seats and 18.7 percent of the popular vote, which was greater than the PCs (which won 16 percent of the popular vote). The Bloc replaced Mulroney's voting base in Quebec, becoming the Official Opposition (at 54 seats). In the election, Chr\u00e9tien's Liberals won a strong majority government. Mulroney claimed he was not responsible for the obliteration of the PCs, and instead blamed Campbell and her relationship with her boyfriend. In \"The Secret Mulroney Tapes\", it was revealed Mulroney said of Campbell, \"Throughout the whole goddam thing she's been screwing around with this Russian guy. The guy was sneaking into hotel rooms and the campaign bus\"; he also said it was \"the most incompetent campaign I've seen in my life.\" In the following 1997 and 2000 elections, the Progressive Conservatives would continue being the smallest party in the House of Commons, holding on to fifth-place status though regaining official party status. In 2003, the party merged with Reform's successor, the Canadian Alliance, to create today's Conservative Party of Canada.\nAfter politics (1993\u20132024).\nAfter leaving office, Mulroney served as an international business consultant and was a partner with the law firm Norton Rose. He, up until his death in 2024, sat on the board of directors of multiple corporations, including the Blackstone Group, Barrick Gold, Quebecor Inc., Archer Daniels Midland, Cendant Corp. (New York), AOL Latin America, Inc. (New York), Cognicase Inc. (Montreal) and Acreage Holdings, one of the largest vertically integrated cannabis companies in the United States. He was a senior counsellor to Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, a global private equity fund in Dallas, chairman of Forbes Global (New York), and was a paid consultant and lobbyist for Karl-Heinz Schreiber beginning in 1993. He was also chairman of various international advisory boards and councils for many international companies, including Power Corp. (Montreal), Bombardier (Montreal), the China International Trust and Investment Corp. (Beijing), J.P. Morgan Chase and Co. (New York), Violy, Byorum and Partners (New York), VS&amp;A Communications Partners (New York), Independent Newspapers (Dublin) and General Enterprise Management Services Limited (British Virgin Islands).\nIn 1998, Mulroney was accorded Canada's highest civilian honour when he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.\nIn 2003, Mulroney received the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars of the Smithsonian Institution at a ceremony in Montreal. The award was in recognition of his career in politics.\nIn January 2004, Mulroney delivered a keynote speech in Washington, D.C., celebrating the tenth anniversary of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In June 2004, Mulroney presented a eulogy for former U.S. president Ronald Reagan during the latter's state funeral. Two years later, at the request of prime minister Stephen Harper, Mulroney travelled to Washington, D.C., along with Michael Wilson, Canada's ambassador to the United States, as Canada's representatives at the state funeral of former president Gerald Ford.\nIn February 2005, as part of a physical examination, a CT scan revealed two small lumps in one of Mulroney's lungs. In his youth, Mulroney had been a heavy smoker. His doctors performed a biopsy, which ruled out cancer; incidentally, his surgery is sometimes cited as an example of the dangers of unnecessary testing. He recovered well enough to tape a speech for the Conservative Party of Canada's 2005 Policy Convention in Montreal in March, though he could not attend in person. He later developed pancreatitis, and he remained in hospital for several weeks. It was not until April 19 that his son, Ben Mulroney, announced he was recovering and would soon be released.\nOn September 12, 2005, veteran writer and former Mulroney confidant Peter C. Newman released \"\". Based largely on remarks from the former prime minister, which Newman had taped with Mulroney's knowledge, the book set off national controversy. Newman had been given unfettered access to Mulroney for a thorough biography and claims Mulroney did not honour an agreement to allow him access to confidential papers. This led Mulroney to respond at the annual Press Gallery Dinner, which is noted for comedic moments, in Ottawa on October 22, 2005. The former prime minister appeared on tape and very formally acknowledged the various dignitaries and audience groups before delivering the shortest speech of the night: \"Peter Newman: Go fuck yourself. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, and good night.\"\nIn 2014, Mulroney became the chairman of Quebecor and defused tensions resulting from the continuing influence of former president and CEO Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau.\nOn December 5, 2018, Mulroney delivered a eulogy for former U.S. president George H. W. Bush during his state funeral.\nAirbus/Schreiber affair.\nOn September 29, 1995, the Canadian Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the RCMP, sent a Letter of Request (LOR) to the Swiss government asking for information related to allegations that Mulroney was involved in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the Government of Canada. The investigation pertained to \"improper commissions\" allegedly paid to German-Canadian businessman Karlheinz Schreiber (or to companies controlled by him), Brian Mulroney and former Newfoundland premier Frank Moores in exchange for three government contracts. These contracts involved the purchase of Airbus Industrie aircraft by Air Canada; the purchase of helicopters by the Canadian Coast Guard from Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm GmbH (MBB) in 1986; and the establishment of a manufacturing plant for Thyssen Light Armoured Vehicles (Bear Head Project) in Nova Scotia, a project which Mulroney as prime minister had cancelled.\nThis LOR \"and its contents were to be kept confidential\" but leaked to the media. As a result, Mulroney launched a $50 million libel lawsuit against the Government of Canada and the RCMP on November 20, 1995. On January 5, 1997, Mulroney agreed to an out-of-court settlement of $2.1 million with the Government of Canada and the RCMP. The Oliphant Commission Report in 2010 stated that Mulroney accepted $225 000 from Schreiber, and former justice minister Allan Rock said he would have used a different litigation strategy in the libel case had he known about these payments.\nMulroney did not disclose that he had received money from Schreiber (which Schreiber alleges was a total of $300,000 in instalments of $100,000 in three separate occurrences between 1993 and 1994 given to Mulroney under the code name \"Britan\" in brown paper envelopes/bags in denominations of $1,000 during secret hotel exchanges). Later, on February 2, 1998, Schreiber met with Mulroney at Mulroney's invitation to the hotel Savoy in Zurich, where, before a spread of smoked salmon and appetizers, Mulroney tried to get Schreiber to verify that nothing could connect Mulroney to the money. Later on, when further information was leaked to the public, Mulroney stated that there was nothing wrong with accepting envelopes of $1,000 bills (which he put into safes and safe deposit boxes without reporting tax on it as income for years after). The Oliphant Commission, presided over by Justice Jeffrey Oliphant, reported on May 31, 2010, that Mulroney \"failed to live up to the standard of conduct that he himself adopted in the 1995 ethics code. Oliphant J. said he could not accept Mulroney's testimony that his acceptance of $225,000 cash was an error in judgment. Rather, it was an attempt to hide the transactions.\nConservative Party of Canada.\nMulroney played an influential role by supporting the merger of the Canadian Alliance (successor of the Reform party) with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative Party of Canada; Mulroney joined the new party upon its formation in 2003. This distinguished him from other prominent PC politicians, such as former prime ministers Joe Clark and Kim Campbell, who became independents as they believed that the Conservative party was too right-wing and drifting toward social conservatism.\nAccording to press reports, Mulroney's membership lapsed in 2006. In early 2009, Mulroney \"called a high-ranking person in the party and asked that his name be removed from all party lists\" due to his anger at the continued inquiry into his financial affairs, although he denies this claim. A Mulroney confidant, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the party's claims preposterous. \"He's part of the history of this party; you can't rewrite history. If they're worried about branding, then shut the inquiry down. They're the ones who called the inquiry.\"\nMonths before the 2015 federal election, Mulroney endorsed prime minister Stephen Harper while campaigning for Eric Girard, a family friend and the Conservative candidate for Lac St. Louis. Mulroney campaigned for Conservative leader Erin O'Toole in the run-up of the 2021 Canadian election. Just over a month later, Mulroney criticized his handling of COVID-19 vaccinations, stating that he should show \"leadership\" and expel unvaccinated MPs from the Conservative caucus. \nIn June 2022, Mulroney said to an audience at Laval University that he could not see himself within the modern Conservative party. In October 2022, Mulroney said he supported the Conservatives' new leader, Pierre Poilievre, who reached to Mulroney after his leadership victory. Mulroney said that he urged Poilievre to move closer to the political centre.\nOther political interventions.\nIn 2003, Mulroney criticized the Chr\u00e9tien government's foreign policy. He expressed his disappointment with the Liberals strengthening relations with China, Russia, and Germany. Instead, he voiced his support for the United States, stating, \"I want to stick with my old friends and allies.\" He also voiced his support for the Iraq War and said Canada would have supported the United States in Iraq if he were still prime minister.\nIn June 2023, Mulroney praised Liberal prime minister Justin Trudeau's handling of negotiations of the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USMCA) and COVID-19 pandemic. Mulroney also criticized former US president Donald Trump, saying that he \"was out to sabotage Canada.\"\nMemoir.\nMulroney's \"\" was released on September 10, 2007. Mulroney criticizes Trudeau Sr. for avoiding military service in World War II, and favourably references sources that describe the young Trudeau as holding anti-Semitic nationalist views and having an admiration for fascist dictators. Tom Axworthy, a prominent Liberal strategist, responded that Trudeau should be judged on his mature views. Historian, former MP and Trudeau biographer John English said, \"I don't think it does any good to do this kind of historical ransacking to try to destroy reputations.\"\nDeath and state funeral.\nMulroney had suffered several years of declining health leading up to his death. He underwent emergency surgery for an unspecified reason in December 2020. Reports spread in April 2023 that he was recovering from prostate cancer treatment. His daughter Caroline stated in August 2023 that her father's health was improving following this and a heart procedure in August.He had been hospitalized as the result of a fall at his home in Palm Beach, Florida, and died on February 29, 2024, at the age of 84.\nHis remains were repatriated on March 8, 2024, at Ottawa Macdonald\u2013Cartier International Airport. A tribute in the House of Commons was held on March 18, after MPs agreed to suspend sitting. Mulroney lay in state at the Sir John A. Macdonald Building in Ottawa on March 19\u201320, before lying in repose at St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal on March 21\u201322. His state funeral was held at the Notre-Dame Basilica on March 23, 2024. Honarary pallbearers included Derek Burney, Michel Cogger, Paul Desmarais, Jr., Yves Fortier, David Foster, former Mulroney press secretary Bill Fox, L. Ian MacDonald, Pierre Karl P\u00e9ladeau, G\u00e9rald Tremblay. The basilica's bell tolled 84 times to denote his age as his casket entered the basilica. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Montreal Christian L\u00e9pine conducted the funeral mass. Mulroney's daughter Caroline Mulroney offered a eulogy along with Justin Trudeau, James Baker Jean Charest, Wayne Gretzky, and Pierre Karl Peladeau. Mulroney's recorded voice was also heard singing \"We'll Meet Again\" at the end of the service as mourners filed out of the basilica. A 19-gun salute in the Old Port of Montreal concluded the ceremony while the bell at Notre-Dame tolled 18 times in honour of the country\u2019s 18th prime minister. Among the guests were Mary Simon, Adrienne Clarkson Micha\u00eblle Jean, Justin Trudeau, Kim Campbell, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, Joe Clark, Stephen Harper, Beverley McLachlin, Pierre Poilievre, Jagmeet Singh, Elizabeth May, Doug Ford, Fran\u00e7ois Legault, Danielle Smith, Bob Rae, Pierre Marc Johnson, Lucien Bouchard, Jean Charest, Pauline Marois, Philippe Couillard. International guests included Sarah, Duchess of York John Major. Other prominent guests included Ryan Reynolds, Conrad Black, Galen Weston Jr., Heather Reisman, Edward S. Rogers III, Harley Finkelstein members of the Irving, Molson and Bronfman families, Rick Mercer, Serge Savard, Vincent Damphousse, Peter Mansbridge, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois L\u00e9pine, Paul Arcand, Robert Fife, and Chantal H\u00e9bert. Mulroney was buried the same day at a private ceremony, at Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.\nLegacy.\nMulroney's legacy as prime minister is considered to be mixed. Mulroney made the case that his once-radical policies on the economy and free trade were not reversed by subsequent governments and regarded this as vindication. His deputy prime minister, Don Mazankowski, said that his greatest accomplishment would be seen as \"dragging Canada kicking and screaming into the 21st century\". His legacy in Canada is associated mostly with the 1989 Free Trade Agreement and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Mulroney argued his government's economic policies helped the subsequent government eliminate the deficit. During his announcement of his intention to resign as prime minister, Mulroney responded to criticism of his policies: \"I tried to do what I thought would be right for Canada in the long term, not what I thought would be politically popular in the short term.\" In \"The Secret Mulroney Tapes\", it was revealed he said of his accomplishments: \"You cannot name a Canadian prime minister who has done as many significant things as I did, because there are none.\"\nMulroney's intense unpopularity at the time of his resignation led many Conservative politicians to distance themselves from him for some years. His government had flirted with 10 percent approval ratings in the early 1990s when Mulroney's honesty and intentions were frequently questioned in the media, by Canadians in general and by his political colleagues. In the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservative party was reduced to two seats, which was seen as partially due to a backlash against Mulroney, as well as due to the fracturing of his \"Grand Coalition.\" In the 1993 election, nearly all of the Tories' Western support shifted to Reform, which replaced the PCs as the major right-wing force in Canada. The Tories only won two seats west of Quebec in the next decade and kept remaining in fifth (last) place. The Canadian right was not reunited until the PCs merged with Reform's successor, the Canadian Alliance, in December 2003 to form the new Conservative Party of Canada.\nIn her memoirs, \"Time and Chance\", and in her response in the \"National Post\" to \"The Secret Mulroney Tapes\", Kim Campbell said that Mulroney left her with almost no time to salvage the Tories' reputation once the bounce from the leadership convention wore off. Campbell claimed Mulroney knew the Tories would be defeated regardless of who led them into the election and wanted a \"scapegoat who would bear the burden of his unpopularity\" rather than a true successor. In a 2019 interview with \"Maclean's\", Campbell described Mulroney as \"a pragmatist, not an ideologue.\" Former Ontario premier David Peterson, who supported both of Mulroney's attempts at constitutional reform while premier, told journalist Peter C. Newman of Mulroney, \"I would never trust or respect him. He is a pathological liar. In fairness, I don't believe he knows he's lying\u00a0... Oh God, you couldn't take anything he said at face value. His essential Achilles heel is his baloney.\"\nIn 2006, Mulroney was named the \"greenest\" prime minister in Canadian history by a 12-member panel at an event organized by \"Corporate Knights\" magazine. Military historians Norman Hillmer and J. L. Granatstein ranked Mulroney eighth out of 20 among Canada's prime ministers in their 1999 book \"Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders\". In 2018, CAQ MNA and then Journal de Montreal journalist, Sylvain L\u00e9vesque, referred to Mulroney as a political influence when criticizing the relatability of progressive decisions made by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In that same year, former Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Michel Gauthier said he considered Mulroney to be the greatest prime minister of the last 50 years. In 2019, St. Francis Xavier University in Nova Scotia inaugurated the Brian Mulroney Institute of Government, a $100-million initiative designed to provide undergraduates with degrees in public policy and governance.\nSupreme Court appointments.\nMulroney chose the following jurists to be appointed by the Governor-in-Council to be puisne justices of the Supreme Court of Canada, one of whom, Beverley McLachlin, was subsequently elevated to Chief Justice of Canada:\nMulroney also advised the appointment of Antonio Lamer (as Chief Justice, July 1, 1990 \u2013 January 6, 2000. Lamer had been appointed a Puisne Justice on the advice of prime minister Pierre Trudeau, March 28, 1980).\nHonours.\nAccording to Canadian protocol, upon becoming prime minister, he was styled \"The Right Honourable\" for life.\n \nHonorary degrees.\nBrian Mulroney received several honorary degrees, including:\nOrder of Canada Citation.\nMulroney was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on May 6, 1998. His citation reads:\nAs the eighteenth Prime Minister of Canada, he led the country for nine consecutive years. His accomplishments include, among others, the signing of the Free Trade Agreement with the United States, the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and the United States, and the Acid Rain Treaty. In other international activities, he assumed the leadership of the Commonwealth countries against apartheid in South Africa and was appointed Co-chair of the United Nations' World Summit for Children. Fiscal reform, important environmental initiatives and employment equity were also highlights of his political career.\nOther awards.\nIn 2018, Mulroney was inducted into the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame and was awarded the George Bush Award for Excellence in Public Service.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}
{"id": "63405", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63405", "title": "Joe Clark", "text": "Prime Minister of Canada from 1979 to 1980 (born 1939)\nCharles Joseph Clark (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian businessman, writer, and retired politician who served as the 16th prime minister of Canada from 1979 to 1980. He also served as leader of the Official Opposition from 1976 to 1979 and from 1980 to 1983.\nDespite his relative inexperience, Clark rose quickly in federal politics. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1972 and won the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party in 1976. He led the party to a minority government in the 1979 federal election, defeating the Liberal government of Pierre Trudeau and ending 16 years of continuous Liberal rule. Taking office the day before his 40th birthday, Clark became the youngest prime minister in Canadian history. \nUpon becoming prime minister, Clark advanced freedom of information legislation (which died upon the dissolution of Parliament) and oversaw the \"Canadian Caper\" rescue in response to the Iran hostage crisis; however, his tenure was brief as the minority government was brought down by a non-confidence vote on his first budget in December 1979. The budget defeat triggered the 1980 election. Clark and the Progressive Conservatives lost the election to Trudeau and the Liberals, who won a majority government and returned to power. As of , he remains the most recent prime minister to have lost power following the defeat of his budget.\nClark lost the leadership of the party to Brian Mulroney in 1983. He returned to prominence in Mulroney's cabinet as Secretary of State for External Affairs from 1984 to 1991 and as President of the Privy Council and Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs from 1991 to 1993. Clark did not stand for re-election in 1993. From 1993 to 1996, he served as Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Cyprus. Clark made a political comeback in 1998 to lead the Progressive Conservatives in their last general election before the party's eventual dissolution, serving his final term in Parliament from 2000 to 2004. After the Progressive Conservatives merged with the more right-wing Canadian Alliance in 2003 to form the modern-day Conservative Party of Canada, Clark sat as an independent Progressive Conservative. He criticized the merger as what he described as an \"Alliance take-over\", believing that the new party was drifting towards social conservatism. Clark today serves as a university professor and as president of his own consulting firm.\nEarly years.\nCharles Joseph Clark was born on June 5, 1939, in High River, Alberta, the son of Grace Roselyn (n\u00e9e Welch) and local newspaper publisher Charles A. Clark.\nClark attended local schools and the University of Alberta, where he earned a bachelor's degree in history (1960) and a master's degree in political science (1973). While in high school, he gained journalism experience with the \"High River Times\" and the \"Calgary Albertan\". In his first year at the University of Alberta, Clark joined the staff of the campus newspaper, \"The Gateway\", and eventually became its editor-in-chief. Clark was also a member of the University of Alberta Debate Society (UADS). He later worked one summer at the \"Edmonton Journal\" where he met his future biographer, David L. Humphreys.\nClark then attended Dalhousie Law School. However, he spent more time with the Dalhousie Student Union, Progressive Conservative politics and the \"Dalhousie Gazette\", than on his courses. After leaving Dalhousie, he unsuccessfully pursued first-year law studies at the University of British Columbia Faculty of Law in Vancouver. He then worked full-time for the Progressive Conservative Party.\nIn 1973, Clark married law student Maureen McTeer. McTeer has developed her own career as a well-known author and lawyer and caused controversy by keeping her maiden name after marriage, a practice less common at the time. Their daughter, Catherine has pursued a career in broadcasting.\nEarly political career.\nClark became politically active while at university, although he had been aware from a young age of politics in Canada. He competed with the University of Alberta Debate Society. He served as president of the University of Alberta Young Progressive Conservatives and eventually served as national president for the Young PCs group. Clark sparred with future political rival Preston Manning in debate forums on campus between the Young PCs and the Youth League of the Alberta Social Credit Party. Clark encountered another future rival when he met Brian Mulroney at a national Young PCs meeting in 1958.\nClark spent time in France to improve his fluency in the French language and took courses in French while he was living in Ottawa. He eventually became comfortable speaking and answering questions in French.\nClark entered politics at age 28 but was unsuccessful as candidate for the provincial Progressive Conservatives in the 1967 provincial election. He served as a chief assistant to provincial opposition leader and future Premier Peter Lougheed and served in the office of federal opposition leader Robert Stanfield, learning the inner workings of Parliament. He then successfully ran in the 1972 federal election and was elected to Parliament as the MP for Rocky Mountain, a largely rural riding in southwestern Alberta.\nClark had initially been viewed with suspicion, but over time won over senior members of the party. Robert Stanfield initially thought Clark not to be fit for politics, but over time came to view him as leadership material. Erik Nielsen viewed Clark as fiercely partisan, but was impressed by Clark's questioning the government.\nClark's social liberalism put him at odds with the right-wing members of his caucus, several of whom were not afraid to confront him. For example, in the lead-up to the 1979 election, the bulk of Clark's riding was merged into the newly created riding of Bow River during a redistribution of ridings. Fellow Tory MP Stanley Schumacher had much of his old riding of Palliser merged into Bow River as well. Even though Clark was now party leader, Schumacher refused to step aside in Clark's favour, forcing Clark to run in nearby Yellowhead.\nProgressive Conservative leadership convention, 1976.\nFollowing the resignation of PC party leader Robert Stanfield, Clark sought and won the leadership of the PC Party at the 1976 leadership convention. Initially, the favourite among Red Tories was Flora MacDonald; however, she did worse than expected, while Clark placed a surprising third in a field of eleven on the first ballot of convention delegates, behind only Claude Wagner and Brian Mulroney. MacDonald dropped off after the second ballot, encouraging her supporters to support Clark, who quickly became the compromise Red Tory candidate. The party's right-wing rallied behind Wagner. Mulroney, a Quebec businessman with no elected political experience, was unable to expand his base of support significantly. As other Red Tory candidates were eliminated during the first four ballots, Clark gradually overtook Mulroney and then Wagner to emerge as the victor on the fourth ballot, by 1,187 votes to 1,122.\nClark, who won the Tory leadership at age 36, remains the youngest leader of a major federal party in the history of Canadian politics. With many veteran Tories having been defeated in the 1968 election, the party effectively skipped a generation by selecting Clark as its new leader.\nOpposition leader (1976\u20131979).\nClark's rapid rise from a relatively unknown Alberta MP to the Leader of the Opposition took much of Canada by surprise. \"The Toronto Star\" announced Clark's victory with a headline that read \"Joe Who?\", giving Clark a nickname that stuck for years. His clumsiness and awkward mannerisms were mocked by some political commentators, such as cartoonist Andy Donato who typically drew Clark with mittens on strings hanging from his suit sleeves.\nHowever, Clark hired experienced staffers such as Lowell Murray, Duncan Edmonds, and William Neville, who shaped his policies and ran his office. He improved his party's standing in national opinion polls. Clark gradually earned the respect of some political observers, including his own caucus, and benefited when live television came to the House of Commons in 1977. Some observers noted that Clark, despite being perceived by many people as something of a square, showed biting wit at times while in Opposition. One of his most famous quips was: \"A recession is when your neighbour loses his job. A depression is when you lose your job. Recovery is when Pierre Trudeau loses his job.\" Television broadcasts of Question Period in the House of Commons served to build Clark and the Tories up as an alternative to the Liberals.\n1979 federal election.\nLarge budget deficits, high inflation, and high unemployment made the Liberal government unpopular. Trudeau had put off asking the Canadian Governor General to call an election as long as possible, in the hope that his party could recover popular support but it backfired, as there was growing public antipathy towards his perceived arrogance. Clark campaigned on the slogans, \"Let's get Canada working again\", and \"It's time for a change\u2014give the future a chance!\"\nIn the latter half of the campaign, the Liberals focused their attacks on Clark's perceived inexperience. Their advertisements declared \"This is no time for on-the-job training\", and \"We need tough leadership to keep Canada growing. A leader must be a leader.\" Clark played into their hands by appearing bumbling and unsure in public.\nWhen Clark undertook a tour of the Middle East in order to show his ability to handle foreign affairs issues, his luggage was lost, and Clark appeared to be uncomfortable with the issues being discussed. That incident was widely lampooned by Toronto Sun cartoonist Andy Donato. During the same tour, while inspecting a military honour guard, Clark turned too soon and nearly bumped into a soldier's bayonet; one of the first major media reports on the incident claimed, with some exaggeration, that he had nearly been beheaded.\nDespite Clark being bilingual, the Tories were unable to make much headway in Quebec, which continued to be federally dominated by the Liberals. While Clark's 1976 leadership rivals were prominent in that province, Claude Wagner had left politics (he died shortly after the election), while Brian Mulroney was still bitter about his loss and turned down an offer to serve under Clark.\nNonetheless, Clark's Progressive Conservatives won 136 seats to end sixteen continuous years of Liberal rule in the election for the 31st Canadian Parliament. Despite receiving fewer votes than the Liberals nationally, the Progressive Conservatives won the popular vote in seven provinces. They also made gains in Ontario, particularly in the Toronto suburbs, winning many seats by narrow margins, offsetting a large Liberal win in Quebec. The Tories were only able to win two seats in Quebec, leaving them six seats short of a majority. The Liberals lost 27 seats, including several high-profile cabinet ministers, and Trudeau announced his intention to step down as party leader.\nPrime Minister (1979\u20131980).\nOn June 4, 1979, the day before his 40th birthday, Clark was sworn in as Canada's 16th prime minister, steering the first Tory government since the defeat of John Diefenbaker in the 1963 election. He was Canada's youngest prime minister, and the first to be born in Western Canada.\nWith a minority government in the House of Commons, Clark had to rely on the support of the Social Credit Party, with its six seats, or the New Democratic Party (NDP), with its 26 seats. At the time, Opposition leader Trudeau said that he would allow the Progressive Conservatives a chance to govern, though he warned the Prime Minister against dismantling Petro-Canada, which was unpopular in Clark's home province of Alberta.\nSocial Credit was below the 12 seats needed for official party status in the House of Commons. However, the six seats would have been just enough to give Clark's government a majority had the Progressive Conservatives formed a coalition government with Social Credit, or had the two parties otherwise agreed to work together. Clark managed to lure Socred MP Richard Janelle to the government caucus, but this still left the Tories five seats short of a majority. Clark however decided that he would govern as if he had a majority, and refused to grant the small Socred official party status, form a coalition, or co-operate with the party in any way.\nClark was unable to accomplish much in office because of the tenuous situation of his minority government. However, historians have credited Clark's government with making access to information legislation a priority. The Clark government introduced Bill C-15, the \"Freedom of Information Act\", which established a broad right of access to government records, an elaborate scheme of exemptions, and a two-stage review process. The legislation was debated at second reading at the end of November 1979 and was referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs. Within days the minority Conservative government was unseated; the legislation died on the order paper. The re-elected Trudeau government subsequently based its \"Access to Information Act\" on the Clark government's Bill C-15. The \"Access to Information Act\" received royal assent in July 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The public now has the legal right of access to government records in some 150 federal departments and agencies.\nThough the election had been held in May, Parliament did not resume sitting until October, one of the longest break periods in Confederation. The gas tax in the budget soured Clark's relationship with Ontario Premier Bill Davis, even though both were Red Tories.\nDuring the campaign, Clark committed to move Canada's embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and re-affirmed this promise shortly after taking office. The move proved somewhat contentious within the cabinet, in part due to economic concerns that might have come about from the move. Moreover, it proved a perilous situation as moving the embassy risked a negative economic response, or a violent one from terrorists, and not doing so would make Clark look indecisive. Ultimately, the Clark government backed off from doing so on October 29, 1979, until Jerusalem's status could be clarified with Israel's neighbors.\nInternationally, Clark represented Canada in June 1979 at the 5th G7 summit in Tokyo. Clark reportedly had a good relationship with US President Jimmy Carter, who phoned Clark to thank him personally for his role in the Canadian Caper.\nFall of government.\nDuring the 1979 election campaign, Clark had promised to cut taxes to stimulate the economy. However, once in office, the 1979 budget he proposed was designed to curb inflation by slowing economic activity. The budget also proposed a 4-cent per litre (18-cent per gallon) tax on gasoline in order to reduce the budgetary deficit. Finance Minister John Crosbie touted the budget as \"short term pain for long term gain\". Though Clark had hoped this change in policy would work to his advantage, it actually earned him widespread animosity as a politician who could not keep his promises, even in such a short period.\nClark's refusal to work with the Socreds, combined with the gasoline tax, came back to haunt him when the budget came before the House of Commons in December 1979. On December 12, NDP Finance Critic Bob Rae proposed a subamendment to the budget motion, stating that the House of Commons did not approve of the budget. The Liberals supported the NDP subamendment. The five Socred MPs had demanded the gas tax revenues be allocated to Quebec and abstained when Clark turned them down. On December 13, the subamendment passed on a 139\u2013133 vote.\nClark was criticized for his \"inability to do math\" in failing to predict the outcome, not only because he was in a minority situation, but also because three members of his caucus would be absent for the crucial budget vote. One was ill and two were stuck abroad on official business. The Liberals by contrast had assembled their entire caucus, save one, for the occasion.\n1980 federal election.\nWhen a new election was called, Clark expected his party would be able to defeat the demoralized and leaderless Liberals easily, since Trudeau had announced his intention to step aside and the Liberals had yet to hold a leadership convention. However, the Progressive Conservatives had misjudged the electorate, since they had not commissioned any polls since August. A November Gallup poll published eight days before the December 11 budget reported that their popularity was down from 36% during the summer to 28%, with the party 19 points behind the Liberals, giving the latter the popular support to initiate the non-confidence motion. After the government fell, Clark's party was caught off guard when Pierre Trudeau quickly rescinded his resignation from the Liberal leadership to lead his party into the subsequent election.\nClark's Tories campaigned under the slogan, \"Real change deserves a fair chance.\" Trudeau swept the Liberals back into power in the February 1980 election with 147 seats, against 103 for the Progressive Conservatives. Davis' criticism of the gas tax was used in the Liberals' Ontario television ads. The Tories lost 19 seats in that province, which ultimately proved to be decisive in the campaign.\nClark's government would last a total of nine months less a day. As Clark's Finance Minister, John Crosbie, famously described it in his own inimitable way: \"Long enough to conceive, just not long enough to deliver.\"\nSupreme Court appointments.\nClark chose Julien Chouinard to be appointed as a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada by the Governor General, who served from September 24, 1979, to February 6, 1987.\nRelationship between Trudeau and Clark.\nTrudeau commented in his memoirs, published in 1993, that Clark was much more tough and aggressive than past Tory leader Robert Stanfield, noting that those qualities served Clark well in his party winning the 1979 election victory. Trudeau also complimented Clark as a respectable leader and a better choice over Brian Mulroney, who had defeated Clark at the leadership convention in 1983. Trudeau told his friends that the Tories had chosen the wrong man.\nOpposition leader (1980\u20131983).\nOpposition to Clark's leadership began to grow after the fall of the PC minority government, and the party's defeat by a resurgent Liberal Party. There were frequent rumors that several potential challengers were covertly undermining Clark's leadership. Though in 1982 Brian Mulroney deliberately appeared at a press conference with Clark to say that he was not seeking the leadership of the PC party, he was in fact conspiring to oust Clark.\nThe Liberal Party had regained national prominence by leading the \"No\" side to victory in the 1980 Quebec referendum and the Constitution patriation. While Trudeau's National Energy Program was hugely unpopular in Western Canada, especially Alberta, it was able to shore up Liberal support in the voter-rich Eastern Canada, particularly Ontario and Quebec, generally having the opposite effect of Clark's proposed gas tax. Difficult budgets and the economic recession resulted in Trudeau's approval ratings declining after the bounce from the 1982 Constitution patriation and showed his party headed for certain defeat by early 1984, prompting him to retire. However, Clark was unable to stay on as Progressive Conservative leader long enough to regain the Prime Ministership.\nOn February 28, 1981, during the party's national convention, 33.5% of the delegates supported a leadership review; they felt that Clark would not be able to lead the party to victory again but Clark considered two thirds of delegates voting no to be an endorsement. At the January 1983 convention in Winnipeg, 33.1% supported a review. This was also considering that the governing Liberals under Pierre Trudeau were slipping in polls, and although the PCs had built up a substantial lead in popularity, Trudeau was expected to retire before the election and a new Liberal leader could have been able to pull off a victory. Moreover, some in the party felt Clark to be too liberal and would be a liability come election time.\n1983 leadership convention.\nIn 1983, after declaring that an endorsement by 66.9% of delegates at the party's biennial convention was not enough, Clark called a leadership convention to decide the issue. In December 2007, German-Canadian businessman and lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber told the House of Commons Ethics Committee that he and other Germans, including Bavarian politician Franz Josef Strauss, and Austrian-Canadian entrepreneur Walter Wolf, had contributed significant funds to finance Quebec delegates to vote against Clark at Winnipeg, denying him the mandate he sought. A public inquiry on these matters, and on other business dealings between Mulroney and Schreiber, was called for early 2008 by Prime Minister Stephen Harper. This led further to the 2009 Oliphant Commission.\nClark immediately nominated to keep his leader's post, and retained support from most of the Red Tories and other party members who were opposed to the public attacks on his leadership by others in the party. Clark already had most of a campaign team up and running by the time he called the leadership convention, as he had mobilized support to help gain in the convention's leadership review. However, Mulroney and John Crosbie had been laying the groundwork for a campaign for some time, with Crosbie expecting Clark to lose or resign soon, and Mulroney supportive of the anti-Clark movement.\nIn a rematch of the 1976 convention, Mulroney emerged as the main challenger, gaining the support of the party's right wing, which viewed Clark as too progressive and opposed his continued leadership. Other party members felt that the federal Liberal Party's stranglehold on Quebec seats (they held all but one of the province's 75 seats) could only be broken by a native from that province, which gave Mulroney considerable support. Media coverage emphasized the pro-business and neo-liberal bent of most of the candidates as a \"Changing of the Guard\" within the PC party from their more classical conservative and moderate elements. Clark's campaign countered this by trying to polarize the election between right wingers and a centrist who had been able to win before. The Mulroney campaign responded by continuing their pro-business line.\nSeveral candidates agreed to an \"ABC\" (Anybody But Clark) strategy for the convention and when news of that back-room deal broke out, support was expected to rally around the party's embattled leader. During delegate voting, Clark won the first ballot, but only won 36.5% of the vote, well short of the 50% required. His support dwindled over the next two ballots. Mulroney, who was endorsed by all but two candidates, defeated Clark on the fourth ballot. Clark urged his supporters to leave the convention united behind Mulroney, and agreed to serve under him.\nMany political observers and analysts have questioned Clark's rationale for the decision. One famous incident involved a 1987 official dinner held for Prince Charles at Rideau Hall. When the Prince met Clark in the receiving line at the function, he asked to Clark: \"why wasn't two thirds enough?\" Clark's wife, Maureen McTeer, elaborated on Clark's decision in her 2003 autobiography, \"In My Own Name\". McTeer suggested that for her husband, anything less than a 75% endorsement would not have been a clear enough mandate to forge onwards from the party membership. Clark feared that the 34% of PC members who did not support him would become his most vocal critics in the upcoming election campaign, and that his continued leadership would have led to fractures in the party. Clark was convinced that he could win another leadership race and gain a clear level of support, once his qualities were compared against the handful of politically inexperienced challengers who coveted his position and who were covertly undermining his leadership.\nMember of Mulroney cabinet.\nSecretary of State for External Affairs (Minister of Foreign Affairs).\nThe Progressive Conservatives, led by Mulroney, went on to win a huge victory in the 1984 election, and Mulroney became prime minister.\nDespite their personal differences, Clark ably served in Mulroney's cabinet as the Secretary of State for External Affairs, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs was known before 1993.\nSome of Clark's accomplishments and bold moves in this role included:\nDuring his term as External Affairs minister, Clark championed Canada's unabashed disapproval of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Canada was the only G7 nation to take such a resolute stance against the apartheid regime during the 1980s. He also took on the difficult Constitution ministerial portfolio after the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, and vigorously pursued his task.\nClark maintained Canada's independent voice politically and socially at a time of increasing economic integration with the US and the rise of more socially conservative right-wing politics there.\nMinister responsible for Constitutional Affairs.\nClark later served as the President of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada.\nWith Quebec's constitutional status within Canada a rising issue, he shifted to become the Minister responsible for Constitutional Affairs. The latter position saw him play a leading role in the drafting of the Charlottetown Accord, which was decisively rejected in a nationwide referendum and further hurt the standing of the PC party in polls.\nFirst retirement from Canadian politics.\nClark retired from politics in 1993, side-stepping the near annihilation of the PC party in the 1993 election under the leadership of Mulroney's successor Kim Campbell.\nClark was appointed as Special Representative to the Secretary-General of the United Nations for Cyprus from 1993 to 1996. In 1993, he founded his own consulting firm, Joe Clark and Associates, Ltd., which he still heads. Clark has also served on the boards of directors or advisory boards of several Canadian companies.\nDuring the 1993\u20131994 academic year, Clark served as a Regents' Lecturer in the Canadian Studies Program at the University of California, Berkeley.\nIn 1994, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. Also in 1994, he wrote the book \"A Nation Too Good to Lose: Renewing the Purpose of Canada\". This book was also published in a French translation.\nThe 1995 Quebec referendum saw the federal side win by less than one percent of the vote. It was widely seen as being the failure of the Charlottetown and prior Meech Lake accords that had caused it to be so close.\nProgressive Conservative leadership, 1998\u20132003.\nOne of the two PC candidates to survive the 1993 wipe-out, Jean Charest, became leader of the PC party following Campbell's resignation. After leading the party to a modest resurgence in the 1997 election, winning 20 seats, Charest bowed to tremendous public pressure and left federal politics to become leader of the Quebec Liberal Party (unaffiliated with the federal Liberals). The party had no obvious candidate to fill Charest's shoes, and turned to Clark once again in 1998. He was elected by a teleconference of PC members from around the country in which each of the party's riding associations was allocated 100 points. The points for each riding were then assigned on the basis of each candidate's share of votes within each riding association. Clark defeated Hugh Segal, free-trade opponent David Orchard, former Manitoba cabinet minister Brian Pallister, and future Senator Michael Fortier for the leadership of the PC Party.\nIt took two years for Clark to return to Parliament. He was elected for Kings\u2014Hants, Nova Scotia, in a by-election on September 11, 2000, after the incumbent MP, Scott Brison, stood down in his favour. This is common practice when a newly elected party leader does not already have a seat in Parliament. For the general election held two months later, Clark yielded Kings-Hants back to Brison and was elected as the MP for Calgary Centre, by then deep in the heart of Canadian Alliance territory.\nClark ran on his previous experience as prime minister and External Affairs Minister. However, he faced a difficult task, with critics and opponents attacking him and the PC Party as a \"vote for the past\". Jean Chr\u00e9tien's governing Liberals were running on their successful economic record, and they were poised to regain the support that they lost in 1997, threatening the PC's 1997 gains in Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces. The PC party lost ground in Quebec (due in part to the departure of Jean Charest to provincial politics), which resulted in three members of the PC caucus defecting to join the Liberal Party prior to the election. However, Clark was judged by audiences to be the best speaker during the 2000 election debates. The party lost seats to the Liberals, though it managed to hang onto the minimum 12 seats necessary to be recognized in the House of Commons as an official party and therefore qualify for research funding, committee memberships, and minimum speaking privileges. Aside from Clark's Calgary seat (one of only three Alberta seats that did not go to the Canadian Alliance), and one each in Manitoba and Quebec, the party's seats were concentrated in Tory bastions in the Atlantic provinces. Clark continually promoted the idea that the PCs would eventually retake Ontario and form a federal government again. His vision for the party was one that was to the left of the Alliance, but to the right of the Liberals.\nHe soon realized that there was no chance of dislodging the Liberals as long as the centre-right remained split. However, he wanted a merger on his terms. He got his chance in 2001, when several dissident Alliance MPs, the most prominent one being Alliance deputy leader and party matriarch Deborah Grey, left the Alliance caucus. The dissidents felt that Alliance leader Stockwell Day had not learned from mistakes made in the last election. While some of them rejoined the Alliance later, seven of them, led by Chuck Strahl of British Columbia and including Grey, refused and formed the Democratic Representative Caucus. The DRC quickly formed a joint caucus with the Tories with Clark as leader.\nThis lasted until 2002, when Stephen Harper ousted Day as Alliance leader. Harper wanted a closer union with the PCs, but Clark turned the offer down in April 2002, and all but two of the DRC members rejoined the Alliance. One of the two, Inky Mark, eventually joined the PCs. Two by-election victories later in 2002 increased the PC caucus to 15 members and fourth place in the Commons.\nClark was selected by the media and many parliamentarians for three years in a row to be Canada's most effective opposition leader between 2000 and 2002, pursuing the Liberal government on issues such as Shawinigate and the Groupaction scandal. In his final mandate, Jean Chr\u00e9tien repeatedly referred to Clark as the Leader of the Opposition (Clark was not), much to the chagrin of the Canadian Alliance politicians who occupied the Opposition Leader's chair during the same period. Indeed, Chr\u00e9tien and Clark had been fellow parliamentarians since the 1970s and they shared a mutual respect despite sitting on opposite benches.\nClark's personal popularity grew as, once again, scandal enveloped Chr\u00e9tien's Liberal government. Clark was widely trusted by Canadians, but this, in his own words, did not translate into more votes and additional seats. Citing this, Clark announced his intention to step down as PC leader on August 6, 2002, at the PC Party's Edmonton policy convention. It was expected that a pro-Alliance merger candidate would succeed Clark, but Clark was instead replaced by Peter MacKay on May 31, 2003. MacKay had signed a controversial deal with Red Tory rival David Orchard, promising not to merge the PC Party with the Alliance. Clark had always encouraged MacKay to keep Orchard and his followers within the PC camp.\nMacKay immediately reversed his position on seeking a merger, and in 2003, 90% of PC Party delegates voted in favor of a merger with the Canadian Alliance. Orchard unsuccessfully tried to block the merger and later joined the Liberal Party.\nLegacy of second PC leadership.\nIn May 2003, the party finally overtook the New Democratic Party as the fourth-largest party in the House of Commons, after by-election wins in Newfoundland and Labrador and Ontario.\nAt the same time, the party was still $10\u00a0million in debt from the 2000 election. The PC Party's membership had also dropped from 100,000 in 1998 to 45,000 card carrying PCs in May 2003. Clark's leadership of the Progressive Conservatives was also the subject of criticism from many United Alternative supporters, who argued that his staunch opposition to a merger with the Reform/Alliance parties helped divide the \"conservative\" vote during the tenure of Jean Chr\u00e9tien. Some critics accused Clark of being more interested in helping the interests of his own party and own career than the Canadian conservative movement in general. Others attacked Clark's goal of the PC party regaining its former power as unrealistic.\nProgressive Conservative\u2013Canadian Alliance merger.\nOn December 8, 2003, the day that the PC Party and the Canadian Alliance were dissolved and the new Conservative Party of Canada registered, Clark was one of three MPs\u2014the other two were Andr\u00e9 Bachand and John Herron\u2014to announce that they would not join the new caucus. MP Scott Brison had already joined the Liberals.\nClark announced that he would continue to sit for the remainder of the session as an independent Progressive Conservative MP, and retired from Parliament at the end of the session.\nLater, Clark openly criticized the new Conservative Party in the run-up to the 2004 election. He gave a tepid endorsement to the Liberal Party in the 2004 election, calling Paul Martin \"the devil we know\". He criticized the new Conservative Party as an \"Alliance take-over\", and speculated that eastern Canada would not accept the new party or its more socially conservative policies against gay marriage and abortion. Clark endorsed former NDP leader Ed Broadbent and other Liberals and Conservatives as individuals, saying that the most important thing was to have \"the strongest possible House of Commons of Canada\" since neither large party offered much hope. Clark was criticized by some for dismissing the new Conservative Party outright rather than helping to steer it towards a moderate path.\nPost-politics, 2004\u2013present.\nClark continues to apply his experience in foreign affairs. Clark served as Public Policy Scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He served as Distinguished Statesman in Residence, School of International Service, and Senior Fellow, Center for North American Studies, both at the American University, Washington, D.C. In addition to teaching classes at the American University in Washington, Clark has written several op-ed pieces for several of Canada's national newspapers since his retirement. In October 2006, Clark took a position at McGill University as a professor of Practice for Public-Private Sector Partnerships at the McGill Institute for the Study of International Development. He serves with the Jimmy Carter Center, routinely travelling overseas as part of the centre's international observing activities.\nJoe Clark is vice-chairman and a Member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organization that works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organization composed of former heads of government, senior governmental and international organization officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them. He is also a member of Washington D.C. based think tank the Inter-American Dialogue.\nClark sat on the International Advisory Board of Governors of the Centre for International Governance Innovation, before 2012.\nClark was attacked while walking down the street in Montreal in mid-November 2007. The attacker first asked him if he was the former prime minister, and when Clark answered that he was, the man struck him and fled. Clark sustained a bloody nose but was not seriously hurt.\nHe published the book \"How We Lead: Canada in a Century of Change\" in 2013.\nIn March 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed Clark special envoy for Canada's bid for a UN Security Council seat. Clark travelled to Algeria, Bahrain, Qatar and Egypt in an effort to seek votes for Canada.\nIn February 2025, Clark called on Canadians to appeal to their American friends to oppose Donald Trump's tariffs amid the trade war with the United States.\nHonours.\nAs a former prime minister, Clark is entitled to carry \"The Right Honourable\" designation for life. Clark was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He is a member of the Alberta Order of Excellence. He was honoured as Commandeur de l'Ordre de la Pleiade from La Francophonie. He also holds the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal (1977), 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal (1992), Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal (2002), Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012), Alberta Centennial Medal (2005) and the King Charles III Coronation Medal (2023). Clark was the first recipient of the Vimy Award. He is Honorary Chief Bald Eagle of the Samson Cree Nation.\nIn 2004, Clark's lifetime achievements were recognized with the Award for Excellence in the Cause of Parliamentary Democracy by Canada's Churchill Society for the Advancement of Parliamentary Democracy.\nOn Tuesday, May 27, 2008, Clark's official parliamentary portrait was unveiled during a reception ceremony to be hung in Centre Block alongside Canada's past prime ministers.\nIn a 1999 survey of Canadian historians Clark was ranked No.15 out of the first 20 prime ministers through Jean Chr\u00e9tien. The survey was used in the book \"Prime Ministers: Ranking Canada's Leaders\" by J.\u00a0L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer.\n\u00c9cole Joe Clark School in High River, Alberta, is named in honour of Clark.\nOrder of Canada citation.\nClark was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada on October 19, 1994.

It was the culmination of Sir Clive Sinclair's long-running interest in electric vehicles. Although widely described as an \"electric car\", Sinclair characterised it as a \"vehicle, not a car\".\nSinclair had become one of the UK's best-known millionaires, and earned a knighthood, on the back of the highly successful Sinclair Research range of home computers in the early 1980s. He hoped to repeat his success in the electric vehicle market, which he saw as ripe for a new approach. The C5 emerged from an earlier project to produce a small electric car called the C1. After a change in the law, prompted by lobbying from bicycle manufacturers, Sinclair developed the C5 as an electrically powered tricycle with a polypropylene body and a chassis designed by Lotus Cars. It was intended to be the first in a series of increasingly ambitious electric vehicles, but the development of the follow-up C10 and C15 models never progressed further than the drawing board, mostly due to the poor public response to the C5.\nOn 10 January 1985, the C5 was unveiled at a glitzy launch event, but it was received less than enthusiastically by the British media. Its sales prospects were blighted by poor reviews and safety concerns expressed by consumer and motoring organisations. The vehicle's limitations \u2013 a short range, a maximum speed of only , a battery that ran down quickly and a lack of weatherproofing \u2013 made it impractical for most people's needs. It was marketed as an alternative to cars and bicycles, but ended up appealing to neither group of owners, and it was not available in shops until several months after its launch. Within three months of the launch, production had been slashed by 90%. Sales never picked up despite Sinclair's optimistic forecasts and production ceased entirely by August 1985. Out of 14,000 C5s made, only 5,000 were sold before its manufacturer, Sinclair Vehicles, went into receivership.\nThe C5 has been described as \"one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry\" and a \"notorious\u00a0... example of failure\". Despite its commercial failure, the C5 went on to become a cult item for collectors. Thousands of unsold C5s were purchased by investors and sold for hugely inflated prices, as much as \u00a36,000 compared to the original retail value of \u00a3399. Enthusiasts have established owners' clubs and some have modified their vehicles substantially, adding bigger wheels, jet engines, and high-powered electric motors to propel their C5s at speeds of up to .\nDesign.\nThe C5 is made predominantly of polypropylene, measuring long, wide, and high. It weighs approximately without a battery and with one. The chassis consists of a single Y-shaped steel component with a cross-section of about The vehicle has three wheels, one of diameter at the front and two of at the rear.\nThe driver sits in a recumbent position in an open cockpit, steering via a handlebar that is located under the knees. A power switch and front and rear brake levers are positioned on the handlebar. As a supplement to or replacement for electric power, the C5 can also be propelled via bicycle-style pedals located at the front of the cockpit. The maximum speed of an unmodified C5 is . At the rear of the vehicle is a small luggage compartment with a capacity of 28 litres (1 cu ft). As the C5 does not have a reverse gear, reversing direction is done by getting out, picking up the front end and turning it around by hand.\nThe C5 is powered by a 12-volt lead\u2013acid electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor would not be able to move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after two or three minutes. A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.\nAlthough it was usually billed as an electric vehicle, the C5 also depends significantly on pedal power. The vehicle's battery is designed to provide 35 amps for an hour when fully charged or half that for two hours, giving the C5 a claimed range of . A display in the cockpit uses green, amber, and red LEDs to display the state of the battery charge. The segments are extinguished one after the other to indicate how much driving time is left. The last light indicates that only ten minutes of power are left, after which the motor is switched off and the driver is left to rely on the pedals. Another display indicates via green, amber, and red LEDs how much current is being used. The C5 is in its most economical running mode when a low amount of current, indicated by the green LEDs, is being used. When the lights are red, the motor is under a high load and the driver needs to use pedal power to avoid overheating and shutdown.\nThe C5 was initially sold at a cost of \u00a3399, but to keep the cost under the \u00a3400 mark a number of components were sold as optional accessories. These included indicator lights, mirrors, mud flaps, a horn, and a \"High-Vis Mast\" consisting of a reflective strip on a pole, designed to make the C5 more visible in traffic. Sinclair's C5 accessories brochure noted that \"the British climate isn't always ideal for wind-in-the-hair driving\" and offered a range of waterproofs to keep C5 drivers dry in the vehicle's open cockpit. Other accessories included seat cushions and spare batteries.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nSir Clive Sinclair's interest in the possibilities of electric vehicles originated in the late 1950s during a holiday job for the electronics company Solartron. Fifteen years later, in the early 1970s, he was the head of his own successful electronics company, Sinclair Radionics, based in St Ives in Cambridgeshire. He tasked one of his employees, Chris Curry \u2013 later a co-founder of Acorn Computers \u2013 to carry out some preliminary research into electric vehicle design.\nSinclair took the view that an electric vehicle needed to be designed from the ground up, completely rethinking the principles of automotive design rather than simply dropping electric components into an established model. He believed that the motor was the key to the design. Sinclair and Curry developed a wafer-thin motor that was mounted on a child's scooter, with a button on the handlebars to activate it. The research got no further, however, as Sinclair's development of the first \"slimline\" pocket calculator \u2013 the Sinclair Executive and its successors \u2013 took precedence. No further work on electric vehicles took place for most of the rest of the 1970s.\nEarly development: the C1.\nIt was not until late 1979 that Sinclair returned to electric vehicle development. Around Christmas that year, he approached Tony Wood Rogers, an ex-Radionics employee, to carry out consultancy work on \"a preliminary investigation into a personal electric vehicle\". The brief was to assess the options for producing a one-person vehicle which would be a replacement for a moped and would have a maximum speed of . Although Wood Rogers was initially reluctant, he was intrigued by the idea of an electric vehicle and agreed to help Sinclair. The vehicle was dubbed the C1 (the C standing for Clive). He built a number of prototypes to demonstrate various design principles and clarify the final specifications.\nA specification of the C1 emerged by the end of the year. It would address short-distance transportation needs, with a minimum range of on a fully charged battery. This reflected official figures showing that the average daily car journey was only , while the average moped or pedal cycle journey was just . The users were envisaged as being housewives, urban commuters, and young people, who might otherwise use cycles or mopeds to travel. The electric vehicle would be safer, more weather-proof, and would offer space to carry items. It would be easy to drive and park and for the driver to enter or exit, and it would require minimum maintenance. The vehicle would be engineered for simplicity using injection-moulded plastic components and a polypropylene body. It would also be much cheaper than a car, costing \u00a3500 () at the most.\nOne area of development that Sinclair purposely avoided was battery technology. Electric vehicles powered by lead\u2013acid batteries had once actually outnumbered internal combustion engine vehicles; in 1912 nearly 34,000 electric cars were registered in the U.S. However, the efficiency of internal combustion engines greatly improved while battery technology advanced much more slowly, leading to petrol and diesel-driven vehicles dominating the market. By 1978, out of 17.6 million registered vehicles on Britain's roads, only 45,000 were electric vehicles in day-to-day use and of those, 90% were milkfloats. Sinclair chose to rely on existing lead\u2013acid battery technology, avoiding the great expense of developing a more efficient type. His rationale was that if the electric vehicle market took off, battery manufacturers would step up to develop better batteries. Wood Rogers recalls:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"We were stuck with the standard technology of the time. A car battery was out of the question because it couldn't stand constant charge/discharge cycles, a traction battery, similar to the kind used in milk floats, could be recharged from flat and a semi-traction battery, often used by caravanners, offered a good compromise. Sadly, though, we had very little freedom of choice.\"\nThe development programme moved to the University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised at an early stage that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982, the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair that it would not be fast enough, that its drivers would get wet when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.\nTo meet the steadily escalating development costs of the vehicle, Sinclair decided to raise capital by selling some of his own shares in Sinclair Research to fund a separate company that would focus on electric vehicles. A \u00a312 million deal was reached in March 1983, of which \u00a38.3 million was used to fund the establishment of the new Sinclair Vehicles company. Sinclair recruited Barrie Wills, a veteran former employee of the DeLorean Motor Company, to lead Sinclair Vehicles as its managing director. Although Wills initially expressed scepticism about the viability of an electric vehicle \u2013 his twenty-five years in the motor industry had convinced him that an electric car was never going to happen \u2013 Sinclair managed to convince him that the project would work. In 1984, Sinclair Vehicles' new head office was established in Coventry in the West Midlands, an area with a long-established link with the motor industry.\nThe project's prospects were boosted by changes in the British government's approach to electric vehicles. In March 1980, it had abolished Vehicle Excise Duty for electric vehicles and by the start of 1983, the Department of Transport was working on legislation that would introduce a new category of vehicle \u2013 the \"electrically assisted pedal cycle\". This had a number of significant advantages from Sinclair's point of view. Such a vehicle would be exempt from insurance and vehicle tax, and the user would not need a driving licence or a helmet, all of which were required for mopeds. The legislation, which was passed in August 1983, was prompted by a lobbying campaign by manufacturers such as Raleigh who wanted to sell electric bicycles.\nSinclair realised that his electric vehicle design could easily be adapted to meet the new legislation. As the \"electrically assisted pedal cycle\" category was so new, there were no existing vehicles on the market that would meet the standards prescribed by the new legislation. However, it imposed a number of restrictions that limited the performance of any vehicle that would qualify under the new standards. The maximum legal speed of the vehicle would be limited to only ; it could not weigh any more than , including the battery; and its motor could not be rated at any more than 250 watts.\nDespite these limitations, the vehicle was seen as only the first step in a series of increasingly ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist. However, Sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle; as the director of the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage \"purely on the convictions of Sir Clive\".\nDevelopment and design.\nWith Sinclair's new specifications in hand, Ogle worked on a three-wheeled design dubbed the C5, which bore similarities with the earlier three-wheeled Bond Bug \u2013 another Ogle design. The vehicle's handlebar steering was the brainchild of Wood Rogers, who decided at the outset that a steering wheel would not be practicable as it would make it impossible for a driver to get in and out easily \u2013 a serious safety disadvantage. He comments that \"putting the bars at the driver's sides made it easy to steer and felt very natural\". A prototype was presented to 63 families in the A, B, C1 and C2 demographic groups in suburban and town environments to determine that the controls were correctly positioned; this was the only external research carried out on the C5. In the autumn of 1983, Wills brought in Lotus Cars to finish the vehicle's detailing, build prototypes and test rigs, carry out testing and take forward the programme to production. The development of the C5 took place over 19 months in conditions of great secrecy, with testing carried out at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving ground in Leicestershire.\nFurther aerodynamic refinements were carried out in Exeter with the development of new body shells which produced further reductions in the vehicle's drag. However, it was felt that something was lacking in the design and a 23-year-old industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, was brought in to refine the shell's appearance. He had won a Sinclair-sponsored electric vehicle design competition at the Royal College of Art and was hired on his graduation to set up an in-house car design studio at Sinclair's Metalab in Cambridge, of which he became the first employee. It was not only Desbarats' first project but, as he later said, \"day one of my working life\", when he turned up at Sinclair's premises. He was taken aback when he saw the C5 for the first time, as he had been expecting a \"proper\" electric car. He said later that he thought \"the concept looked futuristic but was short on practicality. There were no instruments, nowhere to put anything and no security features.\" Desbarats told Sinclair that the design would have to be redone from scratch, \"asking what we were doing about visibility, rear view mirrors, range indications\u00a0...\". It was far too late for this, however; all the key design decisions had already been made. Desbarats told Sinclair that he would need four months to revisit the design and was given eight weeks instead. He created the styling that was used for the final production model of the C5, with wheel trims and a small luggage compartment being added subsequently. Desbarats was also responsible for the creation of the High-Vis Mast accessory, as he felt uncomfortable being so close to the ground with other drivers potentially not being able to see him. He later described his contribution as \"convert[ing] an ugly pointless device into a prettier, safer, and more usable pointless device\".\nThe chassis of the C5 consists of two identical metal pressings which are joined at top and bottom with a closing plate at the rear. It lacks a separate suspension system, instead relying on the chassis structure having enough torsional flex. Its motor was produced in Italy by Polymotor, a subsidiary of the Dutch company Philips. Although it was later said that the C5 was powered by a washing machine motor, the motor was in fact developed from a design produced to drive a truck cooling fan. Lotus provided the gearbox and a rear axle based on a design for car steering columns. The C5's electronics were produced by MetaLab, a Sinclair spin-off. The wheels were assembled from tyres made in Taiwan and wheels from Italy. Oldham Batteries provided a lead\u2013acid battery developed for Sinclair that could manage more than the 300 charge-discharge cycles that had originally been specified.\nThe bodywork was made from two injection-moulded polypropylene shells supplied by three manufacturers; J.J. Harvey of Manchester made the moulds, Linpac provided the shells, and ICI supplied the raw material. According to Rodney Dale, the upper shell mould was \"one of the largest \u2013 if not the largest \u2013 injection mouldings of its type in the UK: possibly even in the world\". The manufacturing process reflected Sinclair's ambition for the C5 production line. A single mould set was capable of producing up to 4,000 parts every week. The two parts of the shell were joined by wrapping a tape around the joint, aligning them on a jig, pressing them together and passing an electric current through the tape to heat and melt it. The same process was used to make the front and rear bumper assemblies of the Austin Maestro and only took about 70 seconds to complete. Although Sinclair had considered producing the C5 at the DeLorean plant at Dunmurry in Northern Ireland, which had one of Europe's most advanced automated plastic-body manufacturing facilities, this did not happen, as the DeLorean Motor Company failed in a controversial bankruptcy that resulted in the plant's closure.\nInstead, the work of assembling the C5 was given to The Hoover Company in the spring of 1983. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) approached Hoover to ask them if they would be interested becoming the principal subcontractor for Sinclair, \"who are working on an electric car, and as a by-product of the research have designed an electrically assisted bicycle. They are looking for a subcontractor to whom they can entrust the assembly.\" The proposal suited all sides. The WDA was keen to support the Hoover washing machine factory at Merthyr Tydfil, situated in the economically depressed South Wales Valleys. Hoover was enticed by Sinclair's projections of sales of 200,000 units a year, increasing to 500,000. Sinclair saw Hoover's plant and expertise as a good match for their fabrication techniques. A contract was signed within a few months.\nProduction, distribution and support.\nThe C5 was produced in great secrecy in a separate part of the Hoover factory with its own duplicate facilities. At first the work was carried out by a small team of people in a sealed room, but as production ramped up Hoover installed two production lines in building MP7, connected to the main factory by a tunnel. A rolling testing stand was located at the end of the production line to test each completed C5 for faults. A mechanical arm simulated the weight of a person weighing and the vehicle's brakes were tested under load. At the end of the process the C5s which had passed testing were rolled into cardboard boxes and loaded straight onto distribution lorries in stacks. Around \u00a3100,000 was spent to set up the factory.\nDistribution centres were set up in Hayes in Middlesex, Preston in Lancashire and Oxford to handle the C5s. Hoover arranged for 19 of its service offices around the UK \u2013 responsible for maintaining customers' vacuum cleaners and washing machines \u2013 to also maintain C5s and provide spare parts. The C5's major consumable item, the battery, was to be supported by 300 branches of Comet and Woolworths.\nHoover trained its engineers to produce C5s and tested its manufacturing processes by assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s. Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured. Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover were capable of producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.\nLaunch.\nThe news of Sinclair's C5 project came as a surprise when it became public and attracted considerable interest, as well as scepticism. \"The Economist\" reported in June 1983 that carmakers were \"startled\" but cautious about Sinclair's prospects; as one competitor put it, \"If it were anyone but Sinclair, we'd say he was bonkers\". \"The Economist\" asked, \"Can a man who has made a fortune out of calculators and computers, and could double it on flatscreen televisions, be that crazy?\" and wondered whether he was \"making a ghastly mistake\", a prediction that industry insiders thought was likely.\nThe C5 was launched on 10 January 1985 at Alexandra Palace in North London. The event was staged in Sinclair's usual glitzy style, with women handing out press packs and a variety of promotional giveaways: magazines, hats, pullovers, T-shirts, key rings, sun visors, badges, mugs, bags, and even a C5 video game. The vehicle was given a dramatic unveiling; six C5s driven by women dressed in grey and yellow burst out of six cardboard boxes, drove around the arena, and lined up side by side. Sinclair announced the launch of a \u00a33 million, three-month-long advertising print and television advertising campaign. The C5 would be available initially by mail order at a cost of \u00a3399 and would subsequently be sold via high-street stores.\nSinclair issued a glossy sales brochure characterising the vehicle as a part of an ongoing exercise in \"cutting giants down to size, turning impersonal tyrants into personal servants\". The brochure highlighted Sinclair's achievements in producing affordable pocket calculators, home computers, and pocket televisions and declared, \"with the C5, Sinclair Vehicles puts personal, private transport back where it belongs\u00a0\u2013 in the hands of the individual.\" The photographs accompanying the text showed housewives and teenagers driving the C5 to shops, railway stations, and sports fields\u00a0\u2013 in the words of technology writers Ian Adamson and Richard Kennedy, \"a blue-sky suburbia exclusively populated by electric trikes and their drivers\".\nThe press was given an opportunity to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, \"an unqualified disaster\". A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. \"The Sunday Times\" called the C5 a \"Formula One bath-chair\"; its reporter \"had travelled five yards outdoors when everything went phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule\". \"The Guardian\"'s reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, while \"Your Computer\" found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: \"The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive \"peep, peep\" noise signalling that the engine had overheated.\" Even the former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper \"The Globe and Mail\" reported that while he had started out well, \"a jaunty smile on [his] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world spluttering almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath\", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: \"It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating.\"\nThe timing and location of the launch event\u00a0\u2013 in the middle of winter, on the top of a snow- and ice-covered hill\u00a0\u2013 later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate. The \"Financial Times\" called it \"the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle\". Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as \"a calculated (or miscalculated) risk\", observing that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and \"the launch could hardly have been held up until the possibility of a bright spring day\". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 \"as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good\". Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.\nReviews.\nIt soon became apparent that the C5 faced more serious problems with public perception than merely a botched launch event. Media reactions to the C5 were generally negative when the first reviews appeared over the following days. As the \"Financial Times\" observed, \"the few hardy journalists who ventured out on the roads returned shivering and dubious about the C5's abilities in such harsh conditions.\"\nA common concern was that it was simply too vulnerable in traffic. \"Your Computer\" commented that \"a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level.\" \"The Guardian's\" motoring correspondent wrote of her \"grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic\u00a0... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic.\" Another \"Guardian\" writer wrote that he \"would not want to drive [the] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted into my face. Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me.\" Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.\nAs teenagers were among the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) \"packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s\". The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of \"kids us[ing] them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down.\" Sinclair dismissed such concerns \u2013 \"I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these\". Teenagers interviewed by \"The Guardian\" were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while it was fun to drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.\nSinclair's claims to have revolutionised the electric vehicle were dismissed by many reviewers; \"Your Computer\" called the C5 \"more of a toy than the 'ideal solution for all types of local journey' which the brochure claims\". \"The Guardian's\" motoring correspondent also characterised it as \"a delightful toy\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" described it as \"a cleverly-designed 'fun' machine that can hardly be regarded as serious, everyday all-weather transport\", while \"The Engineer\" viewed it as \"a smashing big boy's toy, tough enough to take teenage thrashing and possibly a serious vehicle for fit adults to nip out in for the Sunday papers\".\nOn the plus side, the C5's handling characteristics were praised by reviewers. \"The Guardian\" called it \"very easy to master once you have become familiar with the under-thigh handlebar steering and the semi-recumbent driving position with feet on bicycle-type pedals.\" The \"Daily Mirror\" described the arrangement as \"surprisingly easy\" to master, although it cautioned that \"on full speed and on full lock it's very easy to tip it onto two wheels.\" The \"Daily Express\" motoring correspondent wrote that he found the C5 \"stable, comfortable and easy to handle\".\nThe verdict from motoring organisations, road safety groups, and consumer watchdogs was decidedly negative and probably sealed the C5's fate. The British Safety Council (BSC) tested the C5 at Sinclair Vehicles' headquarters in Warwick and issued a highly critical report to its 32,000 members. Sinclair was furious and announced that he would sue the BSC and its chairman, James Tye, for defamation (although nothing came of it) after Tye told the press: \"I am shattered that within a few days 14-year-old children will be allowed to drive on the road in this Doodle Bug without a licence\u00a0... without insurance and without any form of training.\" Several years later, Tye was happy to take responsibility for the C5's failure, describing himself as \"the man entirely to blame for the failure of the Sinclair C5\".\nSales history.\nDespite the problems of the press launch day, a more positive response was expected from the 20,000 members of the public who attended the remaining two days of the launch event to try out the C5 on the Alexandra Palace test track. Sinclair reported the day after the event that its switchboard had been overwhelmed by enquirers, and it expected that all 2,700 units from the first production run would be sold by the following Monday. Setting a pattern that would be repeated throughout the C5's short commercial life, this prediction was wildly optimistic; fewer than 200 were sold during the Alexandra Palace event. However, sales picked up as mail order forms \u2013 which had been sent to all of Sinclair's computer customers \u2013 were returned with fresh orders. Within four weeks, 5,000 C5s had been sold.\nThe C5's users were an eclectic group. They included holiday camps who wanted C5s to rent to campers; the British Royal Family \u2013 Princes William and Harry each had one to drive around Kensington Palace before they were old enough to drive; Sir Elton John, who had two; the magician Paul Daniels, who bought a demonstration model he saw being driven around the BBC Television Centre car park; Sir Arthur C. Clarke, who had two shipped out to his home at Colombo in Sri Lanka; and the Mayor of Scarborough, Michael Pitts, who swapped his official Daimler for a C5. However, as \"The Times\" reported, some of the early buyers were disappointed by the vehicle's limitations, citing its slowness, its limited range and its inability to cope with steep hills, which led some people to return their C5s and ask for a refund.\nAlthough the C5 reached retail stores at the start of March 1985, sales had tailed off. Sinclair resorted to hiring teams of teenagers to drive around London in C5s to promote the vehicle, at a cost to the company of \u00a320 a day. Similar teams were established in Manchester, Birmingham, and Leeds. The company denied that it was a marketing campaign; a spokesman told \"The Times\" that \"we haven't done\u00a0... tests on inner city roads. That is what the team is doing. Marketing is not the prime function but will undoubtedly be a spin-off.\" Sinclair was reported to be surprised at the lack of demand and blamed the press for \"a lack of foresight and pessimistic reporting\". Matters did not improve; three decades later, the C5's failure was attributed in \"Wallpaper\" to there being no market, insofar as \"global warming hadn't been invented then\". The retail chain Comet acquired 1,600 C5s but nine months later most were still unsold.\nAdding to Sinclair's problems, production of the C5 had to be halted for three weeks after numerous customers reported that the plastic moulding attached to the gearbox was impairing the performance of their vehicles. 100 Hoover workers were shifted from the C5 production line to work on replacing the faulty mouldings on returned vehicles. Barrie Wills admitted that Sinclair was also taking the opportunity to \"adjust stocks\" in the light of the C5's poor sales. When production resumed a month later it was at only 10% of the previous level, with 90 of the workers being transferred back to the washing machine production lines. Only 100 C5s were now being produced a week, down from the original 1,000. Over 3,000 unsold C5s were piled up in storage at the Hoover factory, with additional unsold stock in 500 retail outlets nationwide.\nSinclair tried to put a brave face on it, admitting that \"sales have not been entirely up to expectations\" but claiming to be \"confident of a high level of demand for the vehicle\". A spokesman told the media that \"we expect a rapid rise in sales now that the weather is improving\". Possible sales opportunities were explored in mainland Europe, Asia, and the United States, with Sinclair claiming that he had found \"very big\" levels of interest. Hoover were sufficiently persuaded to allow Sinclair to divert 10 of their employees to modify C5s for overseas export. The bid to sell the C5 abroad failed; the Dutch National Transport Service told Sinclair that the C5 was not suitable for Dutch roads without improvements to its braking system, the addition of more reflectors, and the inclusion of the High-Vis Mast as part of the basic package. Most of the other ten countries that Sinclair inquired of demanded similar changes.\nThe C5's reputation received a further battering when major consumer organisations published sceptical evaluations. The Automobile Association questioned many of Sinclair's claims in a report published at the start of May. It found that the range of the vehicle was typically only about rather than the promised by Sinclair, and reported that the C5's battery ran flat after only on a cold day. The C5's running speed was more usually around than the claimed , while its running costs compared unfavourably to that of a petrol-driven Honda PX50 moped. The stability, general roadworthiness, and especially the safety of the C5 were questioned, and the AA suggested that the High-Vis Mast should be included as part of the standard package. It concluded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Consumers' Association published a critical report on the C5 in the June issue of its magazine \"Which?\", concluding that the vehicle was of only limited use and represented poor value for money. All three of the C5s that it tested broke down with a \"major gearbox fault\" and their High-Vis Masts snapped. The longest run between battery charges was only , and a more realistic achievable range was . It also echoed the AA's concerns about the C5's safety and the omission of the High-Vis Mast from the standard package. The magazine also called the C5 \"too easy to steal\", hardly surprising considering that while a security lock could be used to prevent it being driven away, the C5 was light enough that a would-be thief could simply pick it up and carry it off.\nAs the summer of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 remained far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In the middle of that month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to \u00a3259.90 but by the end of the year was selling C5s with a complete set of accessories for only \u00a3139.99, 65% less than the initial price.\nProduction was terminated in August 1985, by which time 14,000 C5s had been assembled. Cashflow problems caused by the paucity of sales caused relations to break down between Sinclair Vehicles and Hoover. In June 1985, Hoover obtained a writ against Sinclair for unpaid debts of over \u00a31.5 million, relating to work carried out over the previous eight months. It did not actually serve the writ but entered negotiations with Sinclair. In mid-August, it publicly announced that it was ceasing production of the C5. A Sinclair spokesman told the media that the halt in production was \"due to a shortage of certain components which are unable to be re-ordered while a financial settlement is pending. Once this has been concluded production is envisaged to recommence.\"\nDemise of Sinclair Vehicles.\nProduction did not recommence and the Hoover production line remained closed permanently. On 19 September 1985, Sinclair Vehicles changed its name to TPD Limited, with a direct subsidiary named Sinclair Vehicles Sales Limited continuing to sell C5s. TPD only lasted until 15 October, when it was placed into receivership. The receivers announced that 4,500 C5s had been sold by Sinclair Vehicles, with another 4,500 remaining in the company's hands. \u00a37.75 million was reportedly owed to creditors, of which \u00a37 million was owed to Sir Clive Sinclair himself in reflection of his personal investment in the project. Hoover was not among the creditors, as Sinclair had managed to settle the dispute on terms that neither company would reveal.\nOn 5 November, TPD was formally liquidated at a creditors' meeting. It was revealed, to the anger of the creditors, that Sinclair had taken out a \u00a35 million debenture to cover the money that he had put into the company. Ordinary creditors faced little prospect of recovering the \u00a31 million left outstanding. Primary Contact, the marketing agency used by Sinclair to promote the C5, was left with the biggest unpaid bill, of nearly \u00a3500,000. The last of the unsold C5s were bought for \u00a375 each by Ellar (Surplus Goods) Ltd of Liverpool, which planned to sell 1,000 of them to an Egyptian businessman for use on a university campus while another 1,500 were intended to be sold in the UK.\nMany reasons have been suggested for the failure of Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls \"the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment\". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: \"It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything.\" Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as \"a sophisticated toy\": \"If you were a little boy, wouldn't you want your parents to get you one this Christmas?\" His strategy was successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to \u00a3700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.\nSome commentators attributed the C5's failure to problems with Sinclair's marketing strategy; only a year after the demise of Sinclair Vehicles, the \"Globe and Mail\" newspaper called it \"one of the great marketing bombs of postwar British industry\". Andrew P. Marks of Paisley College of Technology criticised Sinclair's marketing strategy as confused; the C5 promotional brochure depicts it as a leisure vehicle, showing boys in C5s at a football pitch, women in C5s on a suburban road, and so on, while the text suggests that the C5 is a serious substitute for a car. He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined, appearing to be \"trying to grasp at two different markets\" but was unable to appeal to either, and so failed to take off. The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake, in Marks' view, as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it. This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase.\nThe design researcher and academic Nigel Cross calls the C5 a \"notorious\u00a0... example of failure\" and describes its basic concept as \"wrong\". He said the marketing research for the C5 was carried out \"after\" the vehicle's concept had already been decided, observing that it appears to have been intended \"mainly to aid promotion\" rather than to guide development. Gus Desbarats, the C5's industrial designer, attributes the vehicle's flawed concept to Sinclair operating in a \"bubble\" and believes that Sinclair \"failed to understand the difference between a new market, computing, and a mature one, transport, where there were more benchmarks to compare against\". He comments that the experience of working on the C5 convinced him of the need for industrial designers such as himself to get \"involved early in the innovation process, shaping basic configurations, never again [being] satisfied to simply decorate a fundamentally bad idea\".\nSinclair himself said in 2005 that the C5 \"was early for what it was. People reacted negatively and the press didn't help. It was too low down and people felt insecure, hence it got bad press.\" Sam Dawson of \"Classic and Sport Car Magazine\" described the C5 as \"incredibly fun to drive\", suggesting that the safety concerns \"could have been addressed if it wasn't for the fact that it was already doomed as a national joke.\" He noted the disconnect between the media's expectations of a serious electric car and the reality of the C5, which he called \"just a fun way of getting around\". Professor Stuart Cole of the University of South Wales comments that the C5 suffered from the design of the roads and the attitudes of the time, which were not geared towards pedal or electric vehicles: \"In the days before unleaded petrol, your face would have been at the height of every exhaust pipe, and drivers weren't used to having to consider slower-moving cyclists. But with more cycle lanes, better education, and workplaces providing showers, etc., the world now is much more geared up for people looking for alternatives to the car, and hopefully will become even more so in the future.\"\nLegacy.\nSinclair's other electric vehicles.\nSinclair envisaged producing follow-up vehicles such as the C10, a two-seater city car, and the C15, a three-seater capable of travelling at . As Wills put it at the launch event, \"We're developing a family of traffic-compatible, quiet, economic and pollution-free vehicles for the end of the '80s.\" The C5 was described as \"the baby of the family\". The C10 was intended to be a city car, capable of carrying two passengers at up to in a roofed but open-sided compartment with two wheels at the front and one at the back. Wood Rogers intended it to effectively be an updated version of the Isetta, a 1960s Italian microcar. Sinclair built a full-scale mock-up of it; according to Wood Rogers, \"it looked great. I specified open sides to keep the cost down and having no doors meant it escaped a lot of regulations too.\" The design is strikingly similar to the modern Renault Twizy electric vehicle; Wood Rogers comments that \"you could put the C10 into production today and it would still look contemporary.\"\nAt the time of the C5's launch, Sinclair described the C15 as having \"a futuristic design with an elongated 'tear-drop' shape, a lightweight body made of self-coloured polypropylene and a single, possibly 'roller' type rear wheel\". It would have been launched at the 1988 International Motor Show in Birmingham following a development programme costed at \u00a32 million. Unlike the relatively conventional technology used in the C5, Sinclair intended to use sodium sulphur batteries with four times the power-to-weight ratio of lead\u2013acid batteries to give the C15 much greater speed and range \u2013 over on a single charge. It would have had approximately the same dimensions as a conventional small car, measuring long, high, and wide. However, it could only have worked if sodium sulphur batteries had realised their promise. In the event they did not, the project could not continue, due to thermal problems. Neither the C10 nor the C15 ever left the drawing board.\nAlthough Sinclair went on to produce more (but much smaller) electric vehicles (including the Sinclair Zike in 1992) the C5 debacle did lasting damage to the reputation of subsequent EVs in the UK, which the media routinely compared to the C5. It was not until a highly regarded manufacturer, Toyota, launched a serious and well-received vehicle in the 1990s, the Prius, that the C5 \"jinx\" was finally laid to rest.\nIn 2017 Sir Clive's nephew Grant Sinclair presented what he called an updated version of the Sinclair C5 called the Iris eTrike.\nFrom flop to cult.\nDespite its lack of commercial success when it was released, the C5 later gained an unexpected cult following. Collectors began purchasing them as investment items, reselling them for considerably more than their original retail price. One such investor, Adam Harper, bought 600 C5s from a film company as a speculative investment in 1987. He sold all but four within two years, selling them to customers who wanted a novel or more environmentally friendly form of transportation. He also found willing customers among drivers who had been banned from the road, as the C5 did not need a driving licence or vehicle tax. According to Harper, C5s could be resold for as much as \u00a32,500 \u2013 more than six times the original retail price. By 1996, a Special Edition C5 in its original box was reported to be worth more than \u00a35,000 to collectors.\nC5 owners began modifying their vehicles to achieve levels of performance far beyond anything envisaged by Sinclair. Adam Harper used one C5 as a stunt vehicle, driving it through a tunnel of fire, and adapted another to run at , aiming to break a world land speed record for a three-wheeled electric vehicle and the British record for any type of electric vehicle. He said later: \"Up to 100 mph [160 km/h] it's like you're running on rails, it's really stable. Then at about 110 to 120 mph [180\u2013195 km/h] it starts getting tricky. At that point if a tire blew up or something happened you would be surely dead\".\nAs quoted in the 1987 \"Guinness Book of Records\" under battery powered vehicle: \"John W. Owen and Roy Harvey travelled 919 miles (1479 km) from John O'Groats to Land's End in a Sinclair C5 in 103 hr 15 min on 30 Apr-4 May 1985\" ( average).\nChris Crosskey, an engineer from Abingdon, set a record for the longest journey completed on a C5 on a trip to Glastonbury \u2013 away (\"I nearly died of exhaustion\") \u2013 and tried three times to drive one from Land's End to John o' Groats, a distance of . Another engineer, Adrian Bennett, fitted a jet engine to his C5, while plumber and inventor Colin Furze turned one into a \"monster trike\" with wheels and a petrol engine capable of propelling it at .\nThe singer John Otway has used a C5 in his stage show and publicity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63416", "revid": "48885933", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63416", "title": "Paris (mythology)", "text": "Trojan prince, second husband of Helen of Troy\nParis (), also known as Alexander (), is a mythological figure in the story of the Trojan War. He appears in numerous Greek legends and works of Ancient Greek literature such as the \"Iliad\". In myth, he is prince of Troy, son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, and younger brother of Prince Hector. His elopement with Helen sparks the Trojan War, during which he \nfatally wounds Achilles.\nName.\nThe Ancient Greek name \u03a0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 is probably of Luwian origin, and is comparable to \"Parizitis\", attested as a Hittite scribe's name. The name is etymologically unrelated to that of France's capital city, derived from the Gallic Parisii tribe.\nIn Histories, Herodotus refers to the figure as Alexander but provides no explanation for the name.\nDescription.\nParis was described by the chronicler Malalas in his account of the \"Chronography\" as \"well-grown, sturdy, white, good nose, good eyes, black pupils, black hair, incipient beard, long-faced, heavy eyebrows, big mouth, charming, eloquent, agile, an accurate archer, cowardly, hedonist\". Meanwhile, in the account of Dares the Phrygian, he was illustrated as \"fair, tall, and brave. His eyes were very beautiful, his hair soft and blond, his mouth charming, and his voice pleasant. He was swift, and eager to take command.\"\nFamily.\nParis had a son named Corythus, either by nymph Oenone or through his marriage to Helen. Additionally he and Helen in various sources had three other sons: Bunomus, Aganus (\"gentle\"), Idaeus, and a daughter also called Helen.\nMythology.\nChildhood.\nParis was a child of Priam and Hecuba (see the List of children of Priam). Just before his birth, his mother dreamed that she gave birth to a flaming torch. This dream was interpreted by the seer Aesacus as a foretelling of the downfall of Troy, and he declared that the child would be the ruin of his homeland. On the day of Paris's birth, it was further announced by Aesacus that the child born of a royal Trojan that day would have to be killed to spare the kingdom, being the child that would bring about the prophecy. Though Paris was indeed born before nightfall, he was spared by Priam. Hecuba was also unable to kill the child, despite the urging of the priestess of Apollo, one Herophile. Instead, Paris's father prevailed upon his chief herdsman, Agelaus, to remove the child and kill him. The herdsman, unable to use a weapon against the infant, left him exposed on Mount Ida, hoping he would perish there (cf. Oedipus). He was, however, suckled by a she-bear. Returning after nine days, Agelaus was astonished to find the child still alive and brought him home in a backpack (Greek \"p\u1e17ra\", hence by folk etymology Paris's name) to rear as his own. He returned to Priam bearing a dog's tongue as evidence of the deed's completion.\nParis's noble birth was betrayed by his outstanding beauty and intelligence. While still a child, he routed a gang of cattle-thieves and restored the animals they had stolen to the herd, thereby earning the surname Alexander (\"protector of men\"). It was at this time that Oenone became Paris's first lover. She was a nymph from Mount Ida in Phrygia. Her father was Cebren, a river-god or, according to other sources, she was the daughter of Oeneus. She was skilled in the arts of prophecy and medicine, which she had been taught by Rhea and Apollo, respectively. Through her ability to see the future, she foresaw Paris leaving her but loved him deeply even so. When Paris later left her for Helen, she told him that if he ever was wounded, he should come to her, for she could heal any injury, even the most serious wounds.\nParis's chief distraction at this time was to pit Agelaus's bulls against one another. One bull began to win these bouts consistently. Paris began to set it against rival herdsmen's own prize bulls and it defeated them all. Finally, Paris offered a golden crown to any bull that could defeat his champion. Ares responded to this challenge by transforming himself into a bull and easily winning the contest. Paris gave the crown to Ares without hesitation. It was this apparent honesty in judgement that prompted the gods of Olympus to have Paris arbitrate the divine contest among Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena.\nJudgement of Paris.\nIn celebration of the marriage of Peleus and Thetis, Lord Zeus, ruler and a chief deity of the Greek pantheon, hosted a banquet on Mount Olympus. Every deity and demi-god had been invited, except Eris, the goddess of strife (no one wanted a troublemaker at a wedding). For revenge, Eris threw the golden Apple of Discord inscribed with \"For the most beautiful\" () into the party, provoking a squabble among the attendant goddesses over for whom it had been meant.\nThe goddesses thought to be the most beautiful were Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, and each one claimed the apple. They started a quarrel so they asked Zeus to choose one of them. Knowing that choosing any of them would bring him the hatred of the other two, Zeus did not want to take part in the decision. He thus appointed Paris to select the most beautiful.\nEscorted by Hermes, the three goddesses bathed in the spring of Mount Ida and approached Paris as he herded his cattle. Paris was frightened at the appearance of the deities, but Hermes assured him it was the will of Zeus. Some artistic depictions have the goddesses appear unclad before the mortal. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses attempted to bribe him to choose among them. Hera offered ownership of all of Europe and Asia. Athena offered skill in battle, wisdom and the abilities of the greatest warriors. Aphrodite offered the love of the most beautiful woman on Earth: Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Helen and thereby Aphrodite.\nHowever, Helen was already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. When Menelaus was away from home, Paris seduced Helen into running away with him. In the Iliad, Helen notes how she had followed Paris to Troy, and Apollodorus describes the pair taking valuables together. Some sources claim Paris had to raid Menelaus's house to steal Helen from him, but others say he was first welcomed in.\nThe Spartans' expedition to retrieve Helen from Paris in Troy is the mythological basis of the Trojan War. This triggered the war because Helen was famous for her beauty throughout Achaea (ancient Greece), and had many suitors of extraordinary ability. Therefore, following Odysseus's advice, her father Tyndareus made all suitors promise to defend Helen's marriage to the man he chose for her. When Paris took her to Troy, Menelaus invoked this oath. Helen's other suitors, who between them represented most of Achaea's strength, wealth, and military prowess, were obliged to help bring her back. Thus, the whole of Greece moved against Troy in force and the Trojan War began.\nTrojan War.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHomer's \"Iliad\" casts Paris as unskilled and cowardly. Although Paris readily admits his shortcomings in battle, his brother Hector scolds and belittles him after he runs away from a duel with Menelaus that was to determine the end of the war. His preference for bow and arrow emphasizes this, since he does not follow the code of honor shared by the other heroes.\nEarly in the epic, Paris and Menelaus duel in an attempt to end the war without further bloodshed. Menelaus easily defeats Paris, though Aphrodite spirits him away before Menelaus can finish the duel. Paris is returned to his bedchambers, where Aphrodite forces Helen to be with him.\nParis's second attempt at combat is equally fated: rather than engage the Greek hero Diomedes in hand-to-hand combat, Paris wounds Diomedes with an arrow through the foot. In response to Paris's unseemly crowing, Diomedes disparages him in multiple ways: \"Archer, you who without your bow are nothing, slanderer and seducer, if you were to be tried in single combat fighting in full armour, your bow and arrows would serve you little stead. Vain is your boast that you have scratched the sole of my foot. I care no more than if a girl or some silly boy had hit me. A worthless coward can inflict but a light wound, but when I wound a man, though I but graze his skin it is another matter, for my weapon will lay him out.\" (Iliad, Book 11, 376)\nLater, after slaying Hector and other heroes, Achilles dies by an arrow of Paris with Apollo's help. According to Hyginus (Fabulae, 107) Apollo disguised himself as Paris.\nLater in the war, after Philoctetes mortally wounds Paris, Helen makes her way to Mount Ida where she begs Paris's first wife, the nymph Oenone, to heal him. Still bitter that Paris had spurned her for his birthright in the city and then forgotten her for Helen, Oenone refuses. Helen returns alone to Troy, where Paris dies later the same day. In another version, Paris himself, in great pain, visits Oenone to plead for healing but is refused and dies on the mountainside. When Oenone hears of his funeral, she runs to his funeral pyre and throws herself in its fire.\nAfter Paris's death, his brother Deiphobus married Helen and was then killed by Menelaus in the sack of Troy.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63417", "revid": "2278355", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63417", "title": "Fountains Abbey", "text": "Ruined Cistercian monastery in Yorkshire, England\nFountains Abbey is one of the largest and best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries in England, south-west of Ripon in North Yorkshire, near the village of Aldfield. Founded in 1132, the abbey operated for 407 years, becoming one of the wealthiest monasteries in England until its dissolution, by order of Henry VIII, in 1539.\nIn 1983, Studley Royal Park including the ruins of Fountains Abbey was purchased by the National Trust. The abbey is maintained by English Heritage.\nFoundation.\nAfter a dispute and riot in 1132 at the Benedictine house of St Mary's Abbey, York, 13 monks were expelled, among them Saint Robert of Newminster. They were taken under the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, who provided them with land in the valley of the River Skell, a tributary of the Ure. The enclosed valley had all the natural features needed for the creation of a monastery, providing shelter from the weather, stone and timber for building, and a supply of running water. The six springs that watered the site inspired the monks to give it the name of Fountains.\nAfter enduring a harsh winter in 1133, the monks applied to join the Cistercian order, which since the end of the previous century had been a fast-growing reform movement and by the beginning of the 13th century had more than 500 houses. In 1135 Fountains became the second Cistercian house in northern England, after Rievaulx. The monks of Fountains became subject to Clairvaux Abbey in Burgundy, which was under the rule of St Bernard. Under the guidance of Geoffrey of Ainai, a monk sent from Clairvaux, the group learned how to celebrate the seven Canonical Hours according to Cistercian usage and were shown how to construct wooden buildings in accordance with Cistercian practice.\nConsolidation.\nAccording to archaeologist Glyn Coppack, after Henry Murdac was elected abbot in 1143 the small stone church and timber claustral buildings were replaced; the new church was similar in plan to the church at Vauclair Abbey that Murdac had previously commissioned. Within three years an aisled nave had been added to the stone church, and the first permanent claustral buildings, built in stone and roofed in tile, had been completed.\nIn 1146 an angry mob, annoyed at Murdac because of his role in opposing the election of William FitzHerbert as archbishop of York, attacked the abbey and burned down all but the church and some surrounding buildings. The community recovered swiftly from the attack and founded four daughter houses. Henry Murdac resigned as abbot in 1147 upon becoming archbishop of York. He was replaced first by Maurice, Abbot of Rievaulx (1147-8), then, on the resignation of Maurice, by Thorald (1148\u201350). Thorald was forced by the now archbishop, Henry Murdac, to resign after two years in office.\nThe next abbot, Richard, who held the post until his death in 1170, restored the abbey's stability and prosperity. During his 20 years as abbot he supervised an extensive building programme that involved completing repairs to the damaged church and building more accommodation for the increasing number of recruits. At his death, the chapter house was completed, and the new church almost finished. The work was continued by his successor, Robert of Pipewell. Pipewell was considered a benevolent and virtuous abbot by William Grainge, writing in the nineteenth century.\nThe next abbot was William of Newminster, a noted ascetic, who presided over the abbey from 1180 to 1190. He was succeeded by Ralph Haget, who had entered Fountains at the age of 30 as a novice after pursuing a military career. Prior to his abbacy at Fountains, from 1182 to 1190/1 he was abbot of Kirkstall Abbey. During the European famine of 1194 the abbey provided support for six months to local people in the form of food, shelter and spiritual care. Famine was joined by the spread of disease, and the abbey helped those who needed treatment. During the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries, the north of England was subject to increased taxation, Fountains Abbey included. According to William Grainge, writing in \"Annals of a Yorkshire Abbey: A Popular History of the Famous Monastery of Fountains,\" the taxation of temporal goods had reduced from \u00a3343 in 1292, to \u00a3243 in 1318. Grainge interprets this reduction as evidence for detriment to the estate of the abbey. By 1330s, the abbey was no longer working to surplus, but having to borrow money.\nDuring the first half of the 13th century Fountains increased in reputation and prosperity under the next three abbots, John of York (1203\u20131211), John of Hessle (1211\u20131220) and John of Kent (1220\u20131247). These three abbots managed to complete another expansion of the abbey's buildings, which included enlarging the church and building an infirmary.\nDifficulties.\nBy the second half of the 13th century the abbey was in more straitened circumstances. It was presided over by eleven abbots, and became financially unstable largely due to forward selling its wool crop, and the abbey was criticised for its dire material and physical state when it was visited by Archbishop John le Romeyn in 1294. The run of disasters that befell the community continued into the early 14th century when northern England was invaded by the Scots and there were further demands for taxes. The culmination of these misfortunes was the Black Death of 1348\u20131349. The loss of manpower and income due to the ravages of the plague was almost ruinous.\nA further complication arose as a result of the Papal Schism of 1378\u20131409. Fountains Abbey and other English Cistercian houses were told to break off contact with the mother house of Citeaux, which supported a rival pope. This resulted in the abbots forming their own chapter to rule the order in England. They became increasingly involved in internecine politics. In 1410, following the death of Abbot Burley of Fountains, the community was riven by several years of turmoil over the election of his successor. Contending candidates John Ripon - Abbot of Meaux and Roger Frank a monk of Fountains, were locked in conflict until 1416 when Ripon was finally appointed, ruling until his death in 1434.\nFountains regained some stability and prosperity under abbots John Greenwell (1442\u20131471), Thomas Swinton (1471\u20131478), and John Darnton (1478\u20131495), who undertook some much needed restoration of the fabric of the abbey, including notable work on the church. During Greenwell's abbacy, he reduced the debts of the abbey by 1000 marks, and survived what was characterised as a poisoning attempt by a monk called William Downom. Swinton kept a detailed 'Memorandum Book', which provides exceptional detail on the life of the abbey during his abbacy. Marmaduke Huby (1495\u20131526) expanded the number of monks from twenty-two to fifty-two, and undertook a building programme which included a new tower at the north end of the transept and extending the infirmary. Known to visitors as Huby's Tower, it was decorated with the abbot's insignia, as well as religious texts.\nAt Abbot Huby's death he was succeeded by William Thirsk, who was accused by the royal commissioners of immorality and inadequacy, was dismissed as abbot, retired to Jervaulx Abbey, and was later hanged for his involvement in the Pilgrimage of Grace. He was replaced by Marmaduke Bradley, a monk of the abbey who had reported Thirsk's supposed offences and testified against him. Furthermore Bradley paid 600 marks to essentially buy the abbacy for himself. In 1539 it was Bradley who surrendered the abbey when its seizure was ordered under Henry VIII at the dissolution of the monasteries.\nArchitecture.\nThe abbey precinct covered surrounded by an wall built in the 13th century, some parts of which are visible to the south and west of the abbey. The area consists of three concentric zones cut by the River Skell flowing from west to east across the site. The church and claustral buildings stand at the centre of the precinct north of the Skell. The inner court containing the domestic buildings stretches down to the river and the outer court housing the industrial and agricultural buildings lies on the river's south bank. The early abbey buildings were added to and altered over time, resulting in deviations from the strict Cistercian type. Outside the walls were the abbey's \"home granges\".\nThe original abbey church was built of wood and \"was probably\" two storeys high; it was, however, quickly replaced in stone. The church was damaged in the attack on the abbey in 1146 and was rebuilt, in a larger scale, on the same site. Building work was completed c.\u20091170. This structure, completed around 1170, was long and had 11 bays in the side aisles. A lantern tower was added at the crossing of the church in the late 12th century. The presbytery at the eastern end of the church was much altered in the 13th century. The church's greatly lengthened choir, commenced by Abbot John of York, 1203\u201311 and carried on by his successor, terminates, like that of Durham Cathedral, in an eastern transept, the work of Abbot John of Kent, 1220\u201347. Similarities to the choir at Beverley Minster have been drawn by architectural historian Lawrence Hoey. The tower, which was added not long before the dissolution, by Abbot Huby, 1494\u20131526, is in an unusual position at the northern end of the north transept and bears Huby's motto: \"Soli Deo Honor et Gloria\". The sacristry adjoined the south transept.\nThe cloister, which had arcading of black marble from Nidderdale and white sandstone, is in the centre of the precinct and to the south of the church. The three-aisled chapter-house and parlour open from the eastern walk of the cloister, with the monks' dormitory above; along the cloister's southern walk are, from east to west, the warming house with muniment room above, the refectory, and the kitchens. Parallel with the western walk is an immense, vaulted substructure known as the cellarium (divided into sections serving as cellars and store-rooms, and with the lay brothers' refectory at its southern end, next to the kitchens), which supported the dormitory of the \"conversi\" (lay brothers) above. This building extended across the river and at its south-west corner were the latrines, built above the swiftly flowing stream.\nThe infirmary is located to the east of the latrine block, where portions of it are suspended on arches over the River Skell. It was built in the mid-12th century as a modest single-storey structure, then, from the 14th century, underwent extensive expansion and remodelling to end up in the 16th century as a grand dwelling with fine bay windows and large fireplaces. The great hall was an expansive room , \"one of the largest aisled halls ever built in mediaeval England\". The infirmary had its own oratory or chapel, , and a kitchen, .\nTo the west of the cloister was the lay brothers' infirmary, and beyond that the two guest houses still visible, and a large guest hall to the north of them. Only the base of a pier and a table leg survive of the guest hall, but its plan has been established by geophysical survey.\nTo the east of the abbey, north of the infirmary, is the monks' cemetery. It was long known to exist, but its extent and arrangement were only discovered in 2016, when a partnership between the National Trust, the University of Bradford, Geoscan Research, Magnitude Surveys and Guideline Geo used ground penetrating radar which discovered several hundred graves in a careful and orderly arrangement.\nEndowments and economy.\nMedieval monasteries were sustained by landed estates that were given to them as endowments and from which they derived an income from rents. They were the gifts of the founder and subsequent patrons, but some were purchased from cash revenues. At the outset, the Cistercian order rejected gifts of mills and rents, churches with tithes and feudal manors as they did not accord with their belief in monastic purity, because they involved contact with laymen. When Archbishop Thurstan founded the abbey he gave the community of land at Sutton north of the abbey and at Herleshowe to provide support while the abbey became established. In the early years the abbey struggled to maintain itself because further gifts were not forthcoming. Thurstan could not help further because the lands he administered were not his own, but part of the diocesan estate. After several years of impoverished struggle to establish the abbey, the monks were joined by Hugh, a former dean of York Minster, a rich man who brought a considerable fortune as well as furniture and books to start the library.\nBy 1135 the monks had acquired only another at Cayton, given by Eustace fitzJohn of Knaresborough \"for the building of the abbey\". Shortly after the fire of 1146, the monks had established granges at Sutton, Cayton, Cowton Moor, Warsill, Dacre and Aldburgh all within of Fountains. In the 1140s the water mill was built on the abbey site, so that the grain from the granges could be brought to the abbey for milling.\nIn October 2021, the National Trust announced that they had uncovered the foundations of a 12th- to 13th-century tannery at the abbey, described as being of \"industrial\" scale. The foundations, located close to the River Skell, were discovered using ground-penetrating radar, revealing a number of previously-unknown monastic buildings along a long, \"bowling alley-type extension\" whose use had long been unknown.\nFurther estates were assembled in two phases, between 1140 and 1160 then 1174 and 1175, from piecemeal acquisitions of land. Some of the lands were grants from benefactors but others were purchased from gifts of money to the abbey. Roger de Mowbray granted large areas of Nidderdale and William de Percy and his tenants granted substantial estates in Craven which included Malham Moor and the fishery in Malham Tarn. After 1203 the abbots consolidated the abbey's lands by renting out more distant areas that the monks could not easily farm themselves, and exchanging and purchasing lands that complemented their existing estates. Fountains' holdings both in Yorkshire and beyond had reached their maximum extent by 1265, when they were an efficient and very profitable estate. Their estates were linked in a network of individual granges which provided staging posts to the most distant ones. They had urban properties in York, Yarm, Grimsby, Scarborough and Boston from which to conduct export and market trading and their other commercial interests included mining, quarrying, iron-smelting, fishing and milling.\nApart from the renting out of land, the monks themselves and their laybrothers, numerous in the early period, were committed on a large scale to its efficient development and the management of the landscape, not least the watercourses and woods.\nThe Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 was a factor that led to a downturn in the prosperity of the abbey in the early fourteenth century. Areas of the north of England as far south as York were looted by the Scots. Then the number of lay-brothers being recruited to the order reduced considerably. The abbey chose to take advantage of the relaxation of the edict on leasing property that had been enacted by the General Chapter of the order in 1208 and leased some of their properties. Others were staffed by hired labour and remained in hand under the supervision of bailiffs. In 1535 Fountains had an interest in 138 vills and the total taxable income of the Fountains estate was \u00a31,115, making it the richest Cistercian monastery in England.\nAfter the Dissolution.\nThe Abbey buildings and land were seized by the Crown, and sold on 1 October 1540 to Sir Richard Gresham, at the time a Member of Parliament (MP) and previously Lord Mayor of London, the father of Sir Thomas Gresham. It was Richard Gresham who had supplied Cardinal Wolsey with the tapestries for his new residence of Hampton Court and who paid for the Cardinal's funeral.\nIn 1597 the site was acquired by Sir Stephen Proctor, who built Fountains Hall. Between 1627 and 1767 the estate was owned by the Messenger family. They sold it to William Aislabie who was responsible for combining it with the Studley Royal Estate.\nCurrent status.\nThe abbey is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust and is part of the designated \"Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey\" UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe archaeological excavation of the site began under the supervision of John Richard Walbran, a Ripon antiquary who, in 1846, had published a paper \"On the Necessity of clearing out the Conventual Church of Fountains\". In 1966, the Abbey was placed in the guardianship of the Department of the Environment and the estate was purchased by the West Riding County Council, who transferred ownership to North Yorkshire County Council in 1974. The National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983.\nWorld Heritage Site designation.\nIn 1986 the parkland in which the abbey is situated and the abbey was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It was recognised for fulfilling the criteria of \"being a masterpiece of human creative genius\", and \"an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history.\"\nNational Trust ownership.\nFountains Abbey is owned by the National Trust and maintained by English Heritage. The trust also owns Studley Royal Park, and Fountains Hall, and manages St Mary's Church, designed by William Burges and built around 1873 (owned by English Heritage). All of these are significant features of the World Heritage Site. In January 2010, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal became two of the first National Trust properties to be included in Google Street View, using the Google Trike.\nExhibition and display.\nFountains Mill is the former corn mill, built in the mid-twelfth century by the community. There were two waterwheels installed, run from a leat taken from the Rover Skell. It was later used as a sawmill, and in 1928 a turbine was installed to convert the building to the production of electricity. The turbine installation ended the building's over 800 years of continuous use as a mill. It was refurbished and opened as an exhibition space in 2000. During 2022 the temporary exhibition was of work by the Yorkshire-based photographer Joe Cornish.\nThe Porter's Lodge, which was once the gatehouse to the abbey, houses a modern exhibition area with displays about the history of Fountains Abbey and how the monks lived. The centrepiece of the display is a scale model of the abbey at the time of the Dissolution. Following a suggestion by Commander Clare George Vyner, it was designed by the architect and artist Arthur Edward Henderson (1870\u20131956), and constructed from plastic by P Kemp and E Wilson at workshops in Surbiton. The model, measuring some 10 feet by 7 feet and weighing about a ton, was donated on 23 April 1952. Henderson's book on Fountains Abbey compares photographs of various parts of the ruin with his drawings of how that section would have looked originally.\nClimate crisis.\nSince 2006 assessment of the impact of climate change has been an essential requirement for the management of World Heritage Sites. In early 2021 a National Trust press release stated that the abbey \"is at risk of being irreparably damaged by flooding, with several instances in recent years [particularly in 2007] when the 12th-century ruins and water garden have been deluged by water\". Funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund was subsequently awarded and was intended to help finance the Skell Valley Scheme, which would \"rejuvenate 12 miles of the River Skell\" to help minimize the risk of flooding.\nCultural significance.\nOn screen.\nDuring the cold winter of December 1981 Fountains Abbey was used as a location by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for the music video of their single \"Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)\".\nIn 1972 the abbey was the setting for Alan Bennett's first televised play, \"A Day Out.\" In 1980, the final scenes of \"\" were filmed there. Other film productions that have used locations at the abbey include the films \"Life at the Top\", both \"The Secret Garden (1993)\" and \"The Secret Garden (2020)\", and \"The History Boys\".\nIn October and November 2020, a number of scenes of the second season of the Netflix original \"The Witcher\" were filmed in the abbey and its surroundings. The TV programmes \"Flambards\", \"A History of Britain\", \"Terry Jones' Medieval Lives\", \"Cathedral\", \"Treasure Hunt,\" and \"Gunpowder,\" have also been filmed there.\nIn literature.\nFountains Abbey features twice in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books with poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. In the 1833 edition to a painting of the ruins by N. W. Hook and in the 1836 edition to a view of the interior vaults by Nathaniel Whittock.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a version of their 40-pin 6502 packaged in a 28-pin DIP, making it cheaper to package and integrate in systems. The reduction in pin count is achieved by reducing the address bus from 16 bits to 13 (limiting the available memory range from 64KB to 8KB) and removing a number of other pins used only for certain applications.\nTo do this, A15 to A13 and some other signals such as the interrupt lines are not accessible. As a result, it can only address 8KB of memory, which for some applications at the time (1975) was acceptable and not overly restrictive. The entire 6500 CPU family was originally conceived as a line of very low-cost microprocessors for small-scale embedded systems.\nThe 6507 and 6502 chips use the same underlying silicon layers, and differ only in the final metallisation layer. This ties the interrupt lines to their inactive level so they are not vulnerable to generating spurious interrupts from noise. The first three digits of the chip identifier are part of the silicon layers, and the final digit is in the metallisation layer. Micro-photography of the 6502 and 6507 shows this difference.\nThe 6507 is widely used in two applications: the best-selling Atari 2600 video game console and peripherals for the Atari 8-bit computers including the 850 Serial &amp; Parallel Interface, and the 810 and 1050 disk drives. In the 2600, the system is further limited by the design of the ROM cartridge slot, which only allows for 4KB of the external memory to be addressed. The other 4KB is reserved for the internal RAM and I/O chips, using a minimal-cost partial decoding technique that causes the RAM and peripheral device registers to appear at multiple aliased addresses throughout the 4K address space.\nMost other machines, notably home computers based on the 650x architecture, use either the standard 6502 or extended versions of it, in order to allow for more memory.\nBy the time the 6502 line was becoming widely used around 1980, ROM and RAM semiconductor memory prices had fallen to the point where the 6507 was no longer a worthwhile simplification. Its use in new designs ceased at that point, though the Atari 2600 that contains it continued to be sold into the early 1990s, as it was not discontinued until January 1, 1992. However, late-model Atari 2600 consoles do not necessarily contain a discrete 6507 chip.\nPin configuration.\nThe 6507 uses a 28-pin configuration, with 13 address pins (A0..A12) and 8 data pins (D0..D7). The seven remaining pins are used for power (Vss, Vcc), the CPU timing clock (\u03c60, \u03c62), to reset the CPU (the /RES pin), to request a CPU wait state during its next memory read access (the RDY pin), and for the CPU to indicate if a read or write memory (or MMIO device) access is being performed (the R/W pin). There is no IRQ or NMI pin on the processor.\nThe RDY pin is not included on all other 28-pin cut-down versions of the 6502. Within the Atari 2600, RDY is used to synchronise the CPU to the television video lines. This function is essential for the 'racing the beam' method used by the 6502 and Atari Television Interface Adaptor chip to generate the television video signal. In response to a specific address access, the TIA will assert RDY to halt the CPU until the end of the current video scan line.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first published in English and French in the United States by Reynal &amp; Hitchcock in April 1943 and was published posthumously in France following liberation; Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works had been banned by the Vichy Regime. The story follows a young prince who visits various planets, including Earth, and addresses themes of loneliness, friendship, love, and loss. Despite its style as a children's book, \"The Little Prince\" makes observations about life, adults, and human nature.\n\"The Little Prince\" became Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's most successful work, selling an estimated 140 million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the best-selling in history. \nBy November 2024, the book had been translated into 600 different languages and dialects worldwide. It became the second most translated work ever published, trailing only the Bible. \"The Little Prince\" has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings, radio plays, live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.\nPlot.\nThe book begins with the six-year-old narrator. To determine if grownups are as enlightened as a child, the narrator shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The adults always reply that the picture represents a hat. Upon making a second drawing depicting the elephant inside the boa constrictor, the adults tell him to study things of \"importance.\" He learns to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.\nThe narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator must fix his airplane before his supply of water runs out. Here, he is greeted by a young boy named \"the little prince.\"\nThe prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a crate, claiming the sheep is inside. Surprisingly, this drawing delights the little prince.\nOver the course of days, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He used to live on a house-sized asteroid known on Earth as \"B 612\". The narrator recounts a story of a Turkish astronomer who, after discovering asteroid B 612, gave a presentation on his findings, but was ignored. After dressing in European garments, however, his discoveries were accepted. The asteroid has three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct) and various plants.\nThe prince used to clean the volcanoes and weed unwanted seeds and sprigs that infested his soil, pulling out baobab trees that were constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\nThe prince met a rose that grew on the asteroid. The rose exaggerated ailments to have the prince care for her. The prince made a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watered her, and kept the caterpillars off.\nDespite falling in love with the rose, the prince also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon saying their goodbyes, the rose apologized for failing to show that she loved him. She wished him well and turned down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she would protect herself. The prince laments that he does not understand how to love his rose while being with her.\nThe prince has since visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by one adult. They include:\nSince the prince landed in a desert, he believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished that. The prince next met a flower, who said she had only seen a few men in that part of the world, and they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of someone boring who only repeats words.\nThe prince encountered a row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his rose was unique and thinking she had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thought of as common. He started weeping until a fox came along.\nThe fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary or commonplace to being special and unique... but \"what we tame, we are responsible for forever.\"\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the other roses. Upon their departure, the fox says that important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\nThe prince then met two people from Earth:\nEight days after the plane crash, the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince becomes morose and longs to return home and see his flower.\nThe prince finds a well, saving them. The narrator later finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, worrying that she has been left to fend for herself. The prince bids farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body is too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince says that the narrator only needs to look at the stars to think of the prince's laughter and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away and allows the snake to bite him, falling down.\nThe next morning, the narrator cannot find the prince's body. Managing to repair his airplane, he leaves the desert. The narrator requests to be contacted by anyone in that area who encounters a boy like the prince.\nTone and writing style.\nThe story of \"The Little Prince\" is recalled in a sombre, measured tone by the pilot-narrator, in memory of his small friend, \"a memorial to the prince\u2014not just to the prince, but also to the time the prince and the narrator had together.\" \"The Little Prince\" was created when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\" According to one analysis, \"the story of the Little Prince features a lot of fantastical, unrealistic elements... You can't ride a flock of birds to another planet... The fantasy of the Little Prince works because the logic of the story is based on the imagination of children, rather than the strict realism of adults.\"\nAn exquisite literary perfectionist, akin to the 19th century French poet St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry produced draft pages \"covered with fine lines of handwriting, much of it painstakingly crossed out, with one word left standing where there were a hundred words, one sentence substitut[ing] for a page...\" He worked \"long hours with great concentration.\" According to the author himself, it was extremely difficult to start his creative writing processes. Biographer Paul Webster wrote of the aviator-author's style: \"Behind Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's quest for perfection was a laborious process of editing and rewriting which reduced original drafts by as much as two-thirds.\" The French author frequently wrote at night, usually starting at about 11 p.m. accompanied by a tray of strong black coffee. In 1942 Saint-Exup\u00e9ry related to his American English teacher, Ad\u00e8le Breaux, that at such a time of night he felt \"free\" and able to concentrate, \"writing for hours without feeling tired or sleepy\", until he instantaneously dozed off. He would wake up later, in daylight, still at his desk, with his head on his arms. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry stated it was the only way he could work, as once he started a writing project it became an obsession.\nA native speaker of French, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was never able to achieve anything more than haltingly poor English. Ad\u00e8le Breaux, his young Northport English tutor to whom he later dedicated a writing (\"For Miss Ad\u00e8le Breaux, who so gently guided me in the mysteries of the English language\"), related her experiences with her famous student as \"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry in America, 1942\u20131943: A Memoir\", published in 1971.\n\"Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's prodigious writings and studies of literature sometimes gripped him, and on occasion he continued his readings of literary works until moments before take-off on solitary military reconnaissance flights, as he was adept at both reading and writing while flying. Taking off with an open book balanced on his leg, his ground crew would fear his mission would quickly end after contacting something 'very hard'. On one flight, to the chagrin of colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the Tunis airport for an hour so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry frequently flew with a lined \"carnet\" (notebook) during his long, solo flights, and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him, becoming 'enmeshed in a search for ideals which he translated into fable and parable'.\"\nInspirations.\nEvents and characters.\nIn \"The Little Prince\", its narrator, the pilot, talks of being stranded in the desert beside his crashed aircraft. The account clearly drew on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience in the Sahara, an ordeal described in detail in his 1939 memoir \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" (original French: ).\nOn 30 December 1935, at 2.45am, after 19 hours and 44 minutes in the air, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, along with his copilot-navigator Andr\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vot, crashed in the Sahara desert. They were attempting to break the speed record for a Paris-to-Saigon flight in a then-popular type of air race called a \"raid\", that had a prize of 150,000\u00a0francs. Their plane was a Caudron C-630 Simoun, and the crash site is thought to have been near to the Wadi Natrun valley, close to the Nile Delta.\nBoth miraculously survived the crash, only to face rapid dehydration in the intense desert heat. Their maps were primitive and ambiguous. Lost among the sand dunes with a few grapes, a thermos of coffee, a single orange, and some wine, the pair had only one day's worth of liquid. They both began to see vivid hallucinations. By the second and third days, they were so dehydrated that they stopped sweating altogether. Finally, on the fourth day, a Bedouin on a camel discovered them and administered a native rehydration treatment, which saved Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's and Pr\u00e9vot's lives.\nIn the novella, the fox, believed to be modelled after the author's intimate New York City friend, Silvia Hamilton Reinhardt, tells the prince that his rose is unique and special, as she is the one he loves. The novella's iconic phrase, \"One sees clearly only with the heart\" is believed to have been suggested by Reinhardt.\nThe fearsome, grasping baobab trees, researchers have contended, were meant to represent Nazism attempting to destroy the planet. The little prince's reassurance to the pilot that the prince's body is only an empty shell resembles the last words of Antoine's dying younger brother Fran\u00e7ois, who told the author, from his deathbed: \"Don't worry. I'm all right. I can't help it. It's my body\".\nRose.\nMany researchers believe that the prince's kindhearted, but petulant and vain, Rose was inspired by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's Salvadoran wife Consuelo de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, with the small home planet being inspired by El Salvador where he crashed and stayed to recover while being within view of 3 volcanoes, one of which was Ilamatepec, also known as The Santa Ana Volcano. Despite a tumultuous marriage, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry kept Consuelo close to his heart and portrayed her as the prince's rose, whom he tenderly protects with a wind screen and places under a glass dome on his tiny planet. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's infidelity and the doubts of his marriage are symbolized by the vast field of roses the prince encounters during his visit to Earth.\nThis interpretation was described by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was \"the muse to whom Saint-Exup\u00e9ry poured out his soul in copious letters ... Consuelo was the rose in \"The Little Prince\". \"I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words\", says the prince. \"She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should have guessed at the tenderness behind her poor ruses.\"\nPrince.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry probably has drawn inspiration for the prince's character and appearance from his own self as a youth, as during his early years friends and family called him \"le Roi-Soleil\" (\"the Sun King\") because of his golden curly hair. The author had also met a precocious eight-year-old with curly blond hair while he was residing with a family in Quebec City in 1942, Thomas De Koninck, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck. Another possible inspiration for the little prince has been suggested as Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of fellow aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, whom he met during an overnight stay at their Long Island home in 1939.\nSome have seen the prince as a Christ figure, as the child is sin-free and \"believes in a life after death\", subsequently returning to his personal heaven. When \"Life\" photojournalist John Phillips questioned the author-aviator on his inspiration for the child character, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry told him that one day he looked down on what he thought was a blank sheet and saw a small childlike figure: \"I asked him who he was\", he replied. \"I'm the Little Prince\" was the reply.\nOne of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's earliest literary references to a small prince is to be found in his second news dispatch from Moscow, dated 14 May 1935. In his writings as a special correspondent for \"Paris-Soir\", the author described traveling from France to the Soviet Union by train. Late at night, during the trip, he ventured from his first-class accommodation into the third-class carriages, where he came upon large groups of Polish families huddled together, returning to their homeland. His commentary not only described a diminutive prince but also touched on several other themes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry incorporated into various philosophical writings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I sat down [facing a sleeping] couple. Between the man and the woman a child had hollowed himself out a place and fallen asleep. He turned in his slumber, and in the dim lamplight I saw his face. What an adorable face! A golden fruit had been born of these two peasants... This is a musician's face, I told myself. This is the child Mozart. This is a life full of beautiful promise. Little princes in legends are not different from this. Protected, sheltered, cultivated, what could not this child become? When by mutation a new rose is born in a garden, all gardeners rejoice. They isolate the rose, tend it, foster it. But there is no gardener for men. This little Mozart will be shaped like the rest by the common stamping machine... This little Mozart is condemned.\u2014\u200a\nBackground.\nUpon the outbreak of the Second World War, a laureate of several of France's highest literary awards and a successful pioneering aviator prior to the war, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry initially flew with a reconnaissance squadron as a reserve military pilot in the \"Arm\u00e9e de l'Air\" (French Air Force). After France's defeat in 1940 and its armistice with Germany, he and Consuelo fled Occupied France and sojourned in North America, with Saint-Exup\u00e9ry first arriving by himself at the very end of December 1940. His intention for the visit was to convince the United States to quickly enter the war against Nazi Germany and the Axis forces, and he soon became one of the expatriate voices of the French Resistance. In the midst of personal upheavals and failing health, he produced almost half of the writings for which he would be remembered, including a tender tale of loneliness, friendship, love and loss, in the form of a young prince visiting Earth.\nAn earlier memoir by the author recounted his aviation experiences in the Sahara, and he is thought to have drawn on the same experiences as plot elements in \"The Little Prince\".\nHe wrote and illustrated the manuscript during the summer and fall of 1942. Although greeted warmly by French-speaking Americans and by fellow expatriates who had preceded him in New York, his 27-month stay would be marred by health problems and racked with periods of severe stress and marital strife. These included partisan attacks on the author's neutral stance towards supporters of both ardent French Gaullist and Vichy France. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's American translator (the author spoke poor English) wrote: \"He was restless and unhappy in exile, seeing no way to fight again for his country and refusing to take part in the political quarrels that set Frenchman against Frenchman.\" However, the period was to be both a \"dark but productive time\" during which he created three important works.\nBetween January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys lived in two penthouse apartments on Central Park South, then, at the Delamater-Bevin Mansion in Asharoken, Long Island, and still later, a rented brownstone on Beekman Place, again in New York City.\nThe couple also stayed in Quebec for five weeks during the late spring of 1942, where they met a precocious eight-year-old boy with blond curly hair, Thomas, the son of philosopher Charles De Koninck, with whom the Saint-Exup\u00e9rys resided. During an earlier visit to Long Island in August 1939, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had also met Land Morrow Lindbergh, the young, golden-haired son of the pioneering American aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh.\nAfter returning to the US from his Quebec speaking tour, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry was pressed to work on a children's book by Elizabeth Reynal, one of the wives of his US publisher, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock. The French wife of Eugene Reynal had closely observed Saint-Exup\u00e9ry for several months, and noting his ill health and high stress levels, she suggested to him that working on a children's story would help. The author wrote and illustrated \"The Little Prince\" at various locations in New York City but principally in the Long Island north-shore community of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October.\nAlthough the book was started in his Central Park South penthouse, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry soon found New York City's noise and sweltering summer heat too uncomfortable to work in and so Consuelo was dispatched to find improved accommodations. After spending some time at an unsuitable clapboard country house in Westport, Connecticut, they found Bevin House, a 22-room mansion in Asharoken that overlooked Long Island Sound. The author-aviator initially complained, \"I wanted a hut, and it's the Palace of Versailles.\" As the weeks wore on, the author became invested in his project and the home would become \"a haven for writing, the best place I have ever had anywhere in my life.\" He devoted himself to the book on mostly midnight shifts, usually starting at about 11\u00a0pm, fueled by helpings of scrambled eggs on English muffins, gin and tonics, Coca-Colas, cigarettes and numerous visits by friends and expatriates who dropped in to see their famous countryman. One of the visitors was his wife's Swiss writer paramour Denis de Rougemont, who also modeled for a painting of the Little Prince lying on his stomach, feet and arms extended up in the air. De Rougemont would later help Consuelo write her autobiography, \"The Tale of the Rose\", as well as write his own biography of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nWhile the author's personal life was frequently chaotic, his creative process while writing was disciplined. Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan Library and Museum which had obtained Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original manuscript in 1968, stated: \"On the one hand, he had a clear vision for the shape, tone, and message of the story. On the other hand, he was ruthless about chopping out entire passages that just weren't quite right\", eventually distilling the 30,000 word manuscript, accompanied by small illustrations and sketches, to approximately half its original length. The story, the curator added, was created when he was \"an ex-patriate and distraught about what was going on in his country and in the world.\"\nThe large white Second French Empire-style mansion, hidden behind tall trees, afforded the writer a multitude of work environments, but he usually wrote at a large dining table. It also allowed him to alternately work on his writings and then on his sketches and watercolours for hours at a time, moving his armchair and paint easel from the library towards the parlor one room at a time in search of sunlight. His meditative view of sunsets at the Bevin House were incorporated in the book, where the prince visits a small planet with 43 daily sunsets, a planet where all that is needed to watch a sunset \"is move your chair a few steps.\"\nManuscript.\nThe original 140-page autograph manuscript of \"The Little Prince\", along with various drafts and trial drawings, were acquired from the author's close friend Silvia Hamilton in 1968 by curator Herbert Cahoon of the Pierpont Morgan Library (now The Morgan Library &amp; Museum) in Manhattan, New York City. It is the only known surviving handwritten draft of the complete work. The manuscript's pages include large amounts of the author's prose that was struck-through and therefore not published as part of the first edition. In addition to the manuscript, several watercolour illustrations by the author are also held by the museum. They were not part of the first edition. The institution has marked both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of the novella's publication, along with the centenary celebration of the author's birth, with major exhibitions of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's literary works. Physically, the manuscript's onion skin media has become brittle and subject to damage. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's handwriting is described as being doctor-like, verging on indecipherable.\nThe story's keynote aphorism, (\"One sees clearly only with the heart. What is essential is invisible to the eye\") was reworded and rewritten some 15 times before achieving its final phrasing. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry also used a Dictaphone recorder to produce oral drafts for his typist. His initial 30,000-word working manuscript was distilled to less than half its original size through laborious editing sessions. Multiple versions of its many pages were created and its prose then polished over several drafts, with the author occasionally telephoning friends at 2:00\u00a0a.m. to solicit opinions on his newly written passages.\nMany pages and illustrations were cut from the finished work as he sought to maintain a sense of ambiguity to the story's theme and messages. Included among the deletions in its 17th chapter were references to locales in New York, such as the Rockefeller Center and Long Island. Other deleted pages described the prince's vegetarian diet and the garden on his home asteroid that included beans, radishes, potatoes and tomatoes, but which lacked fruit trees that might have overwhelmed the prince's planetoid. Deleted chapters discussed visits to other asteroids occupied by a retailer brimming with marketing phrases, and an inventor whose creation could produce any object desired at a touch of its controls. Likely the result of the ongoing war in Europe weighing on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's shoulders, the author produced a sombre three-page epilogue lamenting \"On one star someone has lost a friend, on another someone is ill, on another someone is at war...\", with the story's pilot-narrator noting of The Prince: \"he sees all that. . . . For him, the night is hopeless. And for me, his friend, the night is also hopeless.\" The draft epilogue was also omitted from the novella's printing.\nIn April 2012 a Parisian auction house announced the discovery of two previously unknown draft manuscript pages that included new text. In the newly discovered material the Prince meets his first Earthling after his arrival. The person he meets is an \"ambassador of the human spirit\". The ambassador is too busy to talk, saying he is searching for a missing six letter word: \"I am looking for a six-letter word that starts with G that means 'gargling'\u00a0\", he says. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's text does not say what the word is, but experts believe it could be \"guerre\" (or \"war\"). The novella thus takes a more politicized tack with an anti-war sentiment, as 'to gargle' in French is an informal reference to 'honour', which the author may have viewed as a key factor in military confrontations between nations.\nDedication.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry met L\u00e9on Werth (1878\u20131955), a writer and art critic, in 1931. Werth soon became Saint-Exupery's closest friend outside of his Aeropostale associates. Werth was an anarchist, a leftist Bolshevik supporter of Jewish descent, twenty-two years older than Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicated two books to him, \"Lettre \u00e0 un otage\" (\"Letter to a Hostage\") and \"Le Petit Prince\" (\"The Little Prince\"), and referred to Werth in three more of his works. At the beginning of the Second World War while writing \"The Little Prince\", Saint-Exup\u00e9ry lived in his downtown New York City apartment, thinking of his native France and his friends. Werth spent the war unobtrusively in Saint-Amour, his village in the Jura, a mountainous region near Switzerland where he was \"alone, cold and hungry\", a place that had few polite words for French refugees. Werth appears in the preamble to the novella, where Saint-Exup\u00e9ry dedicates the book to him:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Leon Werth\nI ask children to forgive me for dedicating this book to a grown-up. I have a serious excuse: this grown-up is the best friend I have in the world. I have another excuse: this grown-up can understand everything, even books for children. I have a third excuse: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs to be comforted. If all these excuses are not enough then I want to dedicate this book to the child whom this grown-up once was. All grown-ups were children first. (But few of them remember it.) So I correct my dedication:\nTo Leon Werth,\nWhen he was a little boy\nSaint-Exup\u00e9ry's aircraft disappeared over the Mediterranean in July 1944. The following month, Werth learned of his friend's disappearance from a radio broadcast. Without having yet heard of \"The Little Prince\", in November, Werth discovered that Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had published a fable the previous year in the U.S., which he had illustrated himself, and that it was dedicated to him. At the end of the Second World War, which Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry did not live to see, Werth said: \"Peace, without Tonio (Saint-Exup\u00e9ry) isn't entirely peace.\" Werth did not see the text for which he was so responsible until five months after his friend's death, when Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's French publisher, Gallimard, sent him a special edition. Werth died in Paris in 1955.\nIllustrations.\nAll of the novella's simple but elegant watercolour illustrations, which were integral to the story, were painted by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. He had studied architecture as a young adult but nevertheless could not be considered an artist \u2013 which he self-mockingly alluded to in the novella's introduction. Several of his illustrations were painted on the wrong side of the delicate onion skin paper that he used as his medium of choice. As with some of his draft manuscripts, he occasionally gave away preliminary sketches to close friends and colleagues; others were even recovered as crumpled balls from the floors in the cockpits he flew. Two or three original \"Little Prince\" drawings were reported in the collections of New York artist, sculptor and experimental filmmaker Joseph Cornell. One rare original \"Little Prince\" watercolour would be mysteriously sold at a second-hand book fair in Japan in 1994, and subsequently authenticated in 2007.\nAn unrepentant lifelong doodler and sketcher, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had for many years sketched little people on his napkins, tablecloths, letters to paramours and friends, lined notebooks and other scraps of paper. Early figures took on a multitude of appearances, engaged in a variety of tasks. Some appeared as doll-like figures, baby puffins, angels with wings, and even a figure similar to that in Robert Crumb's \"Keep On Truckin\"' of 1968. In a 1940 letter to a friend, he sketched a character with his own thinning hair, sporting a bow tie, viewed as a boyish alter-ego, and he later gave a similar doodle to Elizabeth Reynal at his New York publisher's office. Most often the diminutive figure was expressed as \"...a slip of a boy with a turned up nose, lots of hair, long baggy pants that were too short for him and with a long scarf that whipped in the wind. Usually the boy had a puzzled expression... [T]his boy Saint-Exup\u00e9ry came to think of as \"the little prince\", and he was usually found standing on top of a tiny planet. Most of the time he was alone, sometimes walking up a path. Sometimes there was a single flower on the planet.\" His characters were frequently seen chasing butterflies; when asked why they did so, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, who thought of the figures as his alter-egos, replied that they were actually pursuing a \"realistic ideal\". Saint-Exup\u00e9ry eventually settled on the image of the young, precocious child with curly blond hair, an image which would become the subject of speculations as to its source. One \"most striking\" illustration depicted the pilot-narrator asleep beside his stranded plane prior to the prince's arrival. Although images of the narrator were created for the story, none survived Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's editing process.\nTo mark both the 50th and 70th anniversaries of \"The Little Prince's\" publication, the Morgan Library and Museum mounted major exhibitions of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's draft manuscript, preparatory drawings, and similar materials that it had obtained earlier from a variety of sources. One major source was an intimate friend of his in New York City, Silvia Hamilton (later, Reinhardt), to whom the author gave his working manuscript just prior to returning to Algiers to resume his work as a Free French Air Force pilot. Hamilton's black poodle, Mocha, is believed to have been the model for the Little Prince's sheep, with a Raggedy Ann type doll helping as a stand-in for the prince. Additionally, a pet boxer, Hannibal, that Hamilton gave to him as a gift may have been the model for the story's desert fox and its tiger. A museum representative stated that the novella's final drawings were lost.\nSeven unpublished drawings for the book were also displayed at the museum's exhibit, including fearsome looking baobab trees ready to destroy the prince's home asteroid, as well as a picture of the story's narrator, the forlorn pilot, sleeping next to his aircraft. That image was likely omitted to avoid giving the story a 'literalness' that would distract its readers, according to one of the Morgan Library's staff. According to Christine Nelson, curator of literary and historical manuscripts at the Morgan, \"[t]he image evokes Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's own experience of awakening in an isolated, mysterious place. You can almost imagine him wandering without much food and water and conjuring up the character of the Little Prince.\" Another reviewer noted that the author \"chose the best illustrations... to maintain the ethereal tone he wanted his story to exude. Choosing between ambiguity and literal text and illustrations, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry chose in every case to obfuscate.\" Not a single drawing of the story's narrator\u2013pilot survived the author's editing process; \"he was very good at excising what was not essential to his story\".\nIn 2001 Japanese researcher Yoshitsugu Kunugiyama surmised that the cover illustration Saint-Exup\u00e9ry painted for \"Le Petit Prince\" deliberately depicted a stellar arrangement created to celebrate the author's own centennial of birth. According to Kunugiyama, the cover art chosen from one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's watercolour illustrations contained the planets Saturn and Jupiter, plus the star Aldebaran, arranged as an isosceles triangle, a celestial configuration which occurred in the early 1940s, and which he likely knew would next reoccur in the year 2000. Saint-Exup\u00e9ry possessed superior mathematical skills and was a master celestial navigator, a vocation he had studied at Salon-de-Provence with the \"Arm\u00e9e de l'Air\" (French Air Force).\nPost-publication.\nStacy Schiff, one of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's principal biographers, wrote of him and his most famous work, \"rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry and his Little Prince\", and remarking of their dual fates, \"the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky\". Another noted that the novella's mystique was \"enhanced by the parallel between author and subject: imperious innocents whose lives consist of equal parts flight and failed love, who fall to earth, are little impressed with what they find here and ultimately disappear without a trace.\"\nOnly weeks after his novella was first published in April 1943, despite his wife's pleadings and before Saint-Exup\u00e9ry had received any of its royalties (he never would), the author-aviator joined the Free French Forces. He would remain immensely proud of \"The Little Prince\", and almost always kept a personal copy with him which he often read to others during the war.\nAs part of a 32-ship military convoy he voyaged to North Africa where he rejoined his old squadron to fight with the Allies, resuming his work as a reconnaissance pilot despite the best efforts of his friends, colleagues and fellow airmen who could not prevent him from flying. He had previously escaped death by the barest of margins a number of times, but was then lost in action during a July 1944 spy mission from the moonscapes of Corsica to the continent in preparation for the Allied invasion of occupied France, only three weeks before the Liberation of Paris.\nReception.\nMany of the book's initial reviewers were flummoxed by the fable's multi-layered story line and its morals, perhaps expecting a significantly more conventional story from one of France's leading writers. Its publisher had anticipated such reactions to a work that fell neither exclusively into a children's nor adults' literature classification. \"The New York Times\" reviewer wrote shortly before its publication \"What makes a good children's book? ... \"The Little Prince\", which is a fascinating fable for grown-ups [is] of conjectural value for boys and girls of 6, 8 and 10. [It] may very well be a book on the order of \"Gulliver's Travels\", something that exists on two levels\"; \"Can you clutter up a narrative with paradox and irony and still hold the interest of 8 and 10-year olds?\" Notwithstanding the story's duality, the review added that major portions of the story would probably still \"capture the imagination of any child.\" Addressing whether it was written for children or adults, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock promoted it ambiguously, saying that as far as they were concerned \"it's the new book by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", adding to its dustcover \"There are few stories which in some way, in some degree, change the world forever for their readers. This is one.\"\nOthers were not shy in offering their praise. Austin Stevens, also of \"The New York Times\", stated that the story possessed \"...large portions of the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry philosophy and poetic spirit. In a way it's a sort of credo.\" P. L. Travers, author of the \"Mary Poppins\" series of children books, wrote in a \"New York Herald Tribune\" review: \"\"The Little Prince\" will shine upon children with a sidewise gleam. It will strike them in some place that is not the mind and glow there until the time comes for them to comprehend it.\"\nBritish journalist Neil Clark, in \"The American Conservative\" in 2009, offered an expansive view of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's overall work by commenting that it provides a \"\u2026bird's eye view of humanity [and] contains some of the most profound observations on the human condition ever written\", and that the author's novella \"doesn't merely express his contempt for selfishness and materialism [but] shows how life should be lived.\"\nThe book enjoyed modest initial success, residing on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for only two weeks, as opposed to his earlier 1939 English translation, \"Wind, Sand and Stars\" which remained on the same list for nearly five months. As a cultural icon, the novella regularly draws new readers and reviewers, selling almost two million copies annually and also spawning numerous adaptations. Modern-day references to \"The Little Prince\" include one from \"The New York Times\" that describes it as \"abstract\" and \"fabulistic\".\nLiterary translations and printed editions.\nIn April 2017, \"The Little Prince\" became the world's most translated non-religious book, with translations into 300 languages. This number had risen to 600 by November 2024.\nKatherine Woods (1886\u20131968) produced the first English translation of 1943, which was later joined by several other English translations. Her translation contained some errors. Mistranslations aside, one reviewer noted that Woods's almost \"poetic\" English translation has long been admired by many \"Little Prince\" lovers, who have spanned generations, as her work maintains Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's story-telling spirit and charm, if not its literal accuracy. As of 2019[ [update]] at least seven additional English translations have been published:\nThe Little Prince was also translated by Bonnie Greer for a BBC radio adaptation in 1999.\nEach translation approaches the essence of the original with an individual style and focus.\n\"Le Petit Prince\" is often used as a beginner's book for French-language students, and several bilingual and trilingual translations have been published. As of 2017, it has been translated into more than 300 languages and dialects, including Sardinian, the constructed languages of Esperanto and Klingon, and the Congolese language Alur, as well as being printed in Braille for blind readers. It is also often used as an introduction into endangered varieties with very few speakers like Maya (2001), Aromanian (2006), or Banat Bulgarian (2017). It is one of the few modern books to have been translated into Latin, as in 1961 by Auguste Haury (1910\u20132002) and as in 2010 by Alexander Winkler. A translation of the book was published as \"U'cc priins\u00e2\u017e\" in Skolt S\u00e1mi translated by Skolt S\u00e1mi author Kati-Claudia Fofonoff in 2000, a language spoken in S\u00e1pmi. At the time, the language was spoken by less than 500 people making it the smallest language with a translation of \"Le Petit Prince.\" In 2005, the book was also translated into Toba Qom, an indigenous language of northern Argentina, as . It was the first book translated into that language since the New Testament. It was also translated to a northern Italian dialect, Vogherese. Anthropologist Florence Tola, commenting on the suitability of the work for Toban translation, said there is \"nothing strange [when] the Little Prince speaks with a snake or a fox and travels among the stars, it fits perfectly into the Toba mythology\".\nLinguists have compared the many translations and even editions of the same translation for style, composition, titles, wordings and genealogy. As an example: as of 2011 there are approximately 47 translated editions of \"The Little Prince\" in Korean, and there are also about 50 different translated editions in Chinese (produced in both mainland China and Taiwan). Many of them are titled \"Prince From a Star\", while others carry the book title that is a direct translation of \"The Little Prince\". By studying the use of word phrasings, nouns, mistranslations and other content in newer editions, linguists can identify the source material for each version: whether it was derived from the original French typescript, or from its first translation into English by Katherine Woods, or from a number of adapted sources.\nThe first edition to be published in France, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's birthplace, was printed by his regular publisher in that country, Gallimard, only after the German occupation of France ended. Prior to France's liberation new printings of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's works were made available only by means of secret print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of his best seller , describing the German invasion of France, were covertly printed in Lyon.\nCommemorating the novella's 70th anniversary of publication, in conjunction with the 2014 Morgan Exhibition, \u00c9ditions Gallimard released a complete facsimile edition of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's original handwritten manuscript entitled , edited by Alban Cerisier and Delphine Lacroix. The book in its final form has also been republished in 70th anniversary editions by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt (in English) and by Gallimard (in French).\nA Portuguese translation of the novella in 2007, edited by Eidouro Gr\u00e1fica e Editora Ltda and presented at the XIII Biannual Book Fair of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, holds the Guinness World Record for world's largest book published. The impressive tome measures 2.01 m (6\u00a0ft 7 in) high and 3.08 m (10\u00a0ft 1 in) wide when open, containing 128 pages.\nIt has been translated into minority languages, such as the Irish language, by \u00c9abhloid publishers in 2015.\nSpanish editions.\nAfter being translated by Bonifacio del Carril, \"The Little Prince\" was first published in Spanish as in September 1951 by the Argentine publisher Emec\u00e9 Editores. Other Spanish editions have also been created; in 1956 the Mexican publisher Diana released its first edition of the book, , a Spanish translation by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Franc\u00e9s. Another edition of the work was produced in Spain in 1964 and, four years later, in 1968, editions were also produced in Colombia and Cuba, with translation by Luis Fern\u00e1ndez in 1961. Chile had its first translation in 1981; Peru in February 1985; Venezuela in 1986, and Uruguay in 1990. The book is among the few books in the Castilian cant Gacer\u00eda (as ) or the Madrid slang Cheli (as ).\nBavarian editions.\n\"The Little Prince\" has an adaptation for the inhabitants of Bavaria, Austria and South Tyrol, covering for a large variety of the Bavarian language. The book was adapted by Johannes Limmer and published in 2019. It is called and contains the original pictures of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nChinese editions.\n\"The Little Prince\" is one of the most popular and beloved foreign works of literature in China. It is reported that there are more than 70 Chinese translations of the novella. According to the official website of the Succession Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-d'Agay, the version translated by Li Jihong, which was published in January 2013, sold over two million copies in less than four years. Cheng Li-chun published a translation in Taiwan in May 2022.\nExtension of copyrights in France.\nDue to Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's wartime death, his estate received the civil code designation (English: \"Died for France\"), which was applied by the French government in 1948. Amongst the law's provisions is an increase of 30 years in the duration of copyright; thus most of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.\nThe book will remain under copyright in the US until 2039 and will remain in copyright in France until 2033 or 2045.\nAdaptations and sequels.\nThe wide appeal of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's novella has led to it being adapted into numerous forms over the decades. Additionally, the title character himself has been adapted in a number of promotional roles, including as a symbol of environmental protection, by the Toshiba Group. He has also been portrayed as a \"virtual ambassador\" in a campaign against smoking, employed by the Veolia Energy Services Group, and his name was used as an episode title in the TV series \"Lost\".\nThe multi-layered fable, styled as a children's story with its philosophical elements of irony and paradox directed towards adults, allowed \"The Little Prince\" to be transferred into various other art forms and media, including:\nIn 1997, Jean-Pierre Davidts wrote what could be considered a sequel to \"The Little Prince\", entitled \"Le petit prince retrouv\u00e9\" (\"The Little Prince Returns\"). In this version, the shipwrecked narrator encounters the little prince on a lone island; the prince has returned to seek help against a tiger who threatens his sheep. Another sequel titled \"The Return of the Little Prince\" was written by former actress Ysatis de Saint-Simone, niece of Consuelo de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry.\nHonours and legacy.\nMuseums and exhibits.\nMorgan exhibitions.\nNew York City's Morgan Library &amp; Museum mounted three showings of the original manuscript, with its first showing in 1994, on the occasion of the story's 50th anniversary of publication, followed by one celebrating the author's centennial of birth in 2000, with its last and largest exhibition in 2014 honouring the novella's 70th anniversary.\nThe 1994 exhibition displayed the original manuscript, translated by the museum's art historian Ruth Kraemer, as well as a number of the story's watercolours drawn from the Morgan's permanent collection. Also included with the exhibits was a 20-minute video it produced, \"My Grown-Up Friend, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\", narrated by actor Macaulay Culkin, along with photos of the author, correspondence to Consuelo, a signed first edition of \"The Little Prince\", and several international editions in other languages.\nIn January 2014, the museum mounted a third, significantly larger, exhibition centered on the novella's creative origins and its history. The major showing of \"The Little Prince: A New York Story\" celebrated the story's 70th anniversary. It examined both the novella's New York origins and Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's creative processes, looking at his story and paintings as they evolved from conceptual germ form into progressively more refined versions and finally into the book's highly polished first edition. It was as if visitors were able to look over his shoulder as he worked, according to curator Christine Nelson. Funding for the 2014 exhibition was provided by several benefactors, including The Florence Gould Foundation, The Caroline Macomber Fund, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Air France and the New York State Council on the Arts.\nThe new, more comprehensive exhibits included 35 watercolor paintings and 25 of the work's original 140 handwritten manuscript pages, with his almost illegible handwriting penciled onto 'Fidelity' watermarked onion skin paper. The autograph manuscript pages included struck-through content that was not published in the novella's first edition. As well, some 43 preparatory pencil drawings that evolved into the story's illustrations accompanied the manuscript, many of them dampened by moisture that rippled its onion skin media. One painting depicted the prince floating above Earth wearing a yellow scarf was wrinkled, having been crumpled up and thrown away before being retrieved for preservation. Another drawing loaned from Silvia Hamilton's grandson depicted the diminutive prince observing a sunset on his home asteroid; two other versions of the same drawing were also displayed alongside it allowing visitors to observe the drawing's progressive refinement. The initial working manuscript and sketches, displayed side by side with pages from the novella's first edition, allowed viewers to observe the evolution of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work.\nShortly before departing the United States to rejoin his reconnaissance squadron in North Africa in its struggle against Nazi Germany, Saint-Exup\u00e9ry appeared unexpectedly in military uniform at the door of his intimate friend, Silvia Hamilton. He presented his working manuscript and its preliminary drawings in a \"rumpled paper bag\", placed onto her home's entryway table, offering, \"I'd like to give you something splendid, but this is all I have\". Several of the manuscript pages bore accidental coffee stains and cigarette scorch marks. The Morgan later acquired the 30,000-word manuscript from Hamilton in 1968, with its pages becoming the centrepieces of its exhibitions on Saint-Exup\u00e9ry's work. The 2014 exhibition also borrowed artifacts and the author's personal letters from the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry-d'Gay Estate, as well as materials from other private collections, libraries and museums in the United States and France. Running concurrent with its 2014 exhibition, the Morgan held a series of lectures, concerts and film showings, including talks by Saint-Exup\u00e9ry biographer Stacy Schiff, writer Adam Gopnik, and author Peter S\u00eds on his new work \"The Pilot and The Little Prince: The Life of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\",\nAdditional exhibits included photos of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry by \"Life\" photojournalist John Phillips, other photos of the author's New York area homes, an Orson Welles screenplay of the novella the filmmaker attempted to produce as a movie in collaboration with Walt Disney, as well as one of the few signed copies extant of \"The Little Prince\", gifted to Hamilton's 12-year-old son.\nProfessional wrestling.\nFrench professional wrestler was billed as Le Petit Prince.\nPakistani-British professional wrestler Mohammed Allam was billed as The Little Prince.\nThe Little Prince Day.\nSince 2020, June 29 is International Little Prince Day. This date was chosen to commemorate the birth of Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, which occurred on June 29, 1900. The Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Foundation started the initiative striving to promote the humanist values carried by the book published in 1943. Mark Osborne was one of the first personalities to participate in the Little Prince Day 2020.\nMerchandise and collaboration.\nIn 2023, \"The Little Prince\" inspired a collaboration with Chinese toy brand Pop Mart and artist Hideaki Kawashima\u2019s \"Hirono\" series. Titled \"Pop Mart x Le Petit Prince \u2013 La Nouvelle S\u00e9rie de Figurines par Hirono\", the collection features reinterpretations of characters from the novella, including the Little Prince, the Rose, and the Fox. The figurines depict scenes such as the Little Prince standing atop his asteroid B612 and interacting with the Fox under a starry sky. The collaboration was marketed as a celebration of the story\u2019s themes of love, friendship, and exploration.\nThe Montblanc Luxury Writing Instrument Company created three series of luxury fountain pens based on the \"Little Prince\" series, including the Le Petit Prince, the Le Petit Prince Aviator and the Le Petit Prince and Planet pens in various models.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "63428", "revid": "50077501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63428", "title": "Thomas Middleton", "text": "English playwright and poet (1580\u20131627)\nThomas Middleton (baptised 18 April 1580 \u2013 July 1627; also spelt \"Midleton\") was an English Jacobean playwright and poet. He, with John Fletcher and Ben Jonson, was among the most successful and prolific of playwrights at work in the Jacobean period, and among the few to gain equal success in comedy and tragedy. He was also a prolific writer of masques and pageants.\nLife.\nMiddleton was born in London and baptised on 18 April 1580. He was the son of a bricklayer, who had raised himself to the status of a gentleman and owned property adjoining the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch. Middleton was five when his father died and his mother's subsequent remarriage dissolved into a 15-year battle over the inheritance of Thomas and his younger sister \u2013 an experience that informed him about the legal system and may have incited his repeated satire against the legal profession.\nMiddleton attended The Queen's College, Oxford, matriculating in 1598, but he did not graduate. Before he left Oxford sometime in 1600 or 1601, he wrote and published three long poems in popular Elizabethan styles. None of them appears to have been especially successful, and one, \"\", ran foul of an Anglican church ban on verse satire and was burned. Nevertheless, his literary career was launched.\nIn the early 17th century, Middleton made a living writing topical pamphlets, including one \u2013 \"Penniless Parliament of Threadbare Poets\" \u2013 that was reprinted several times and became the subject of a parliamentary inquiry. At the same time, records in the diary of Philip Henslowe show that Middleton was writing for the Admiral's Men. Unlike Shakespeare, Middleton remained a free agent, able to write for whichever company hired him. His early dramatic career was marked by controversy. His friendship with Thomas Dekker brought him into conflict with Ben Jonson and George Chapman in the War of the Theatres. The grudge against Jonson continued as late as 1626, when Jonson's play \"The Staple of News\" indulges in a slur on Middleton's great success, \"A Game at Chess\". It has been argued that Middleton's \"Inner Temple Masque\" (1619) sneers at Jonson (then absent in Scotland) as a \"silenced bricklayer\".\nIn 1603, Middleton married. In the same year an outbreak of the plague forced the London theatres to close, while James I came to the English throne. These events marked the beginning of Middleton's greatest period as a playwright. Having passed the time during the plague composing prose pamphlets (including a continuation of Thomas Nashe's \"Pierce Penniless\"), he returned to drama with great energy, producing almost a score of plays for several companies and in several genres, notably city comedy and revenge tragedy. He continued to collaborate with Dekker: the two produced \"The Roaring Girl\", a biography of the contemporary thief Mary Frith.\nIn the 1610s, Middleton began a fruitful collaboration with the actor William Rowley, producing \"Wit at Several Weapons\" and \"A Fair Quarrel\". Working alone in 1613, Middleton produced a comic masterpiece: \"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside\". He also became increasingly involved with civic pageants, and in 1620 became officially appointed as chronologist to the City of London, a post he held until his death in 1627, when it passed to Jonson.\nSuch official duties did not interrupt Middleton's dramatic writing; the 1620s saw the production of his and Rowley's tragedy \"The Changeling\", and of several tragicomedies. In 1624, he reached a peak of notoriety when his dramatic allegory \"A Game at Chess\" was staged by the King's Men. The play used the conceit of a chess game to present and satirise the recent intrigues surrounding the Spanish Match. Though Middleton's approach was strongly patriotic, the Privy Council silenced the play after nine performances, having received a complaint from the Spanish Ambassador. Middleton faced an unknown, probably frightening degree of punishment. Since no play later than \"A Game at Chess\" is recorded, it has been suggested that the sentence included a ban on writing for the stage.\nDeath.\nMiddleton died at his home at Newington Butts in Southwark in 1627, and was buried on 4 July in St Mary's churchyard. The old church of St Mary's was demolished in 1876 for road-widening. Its replacement elsewhere in Kennington Park Road was destroyed in the Second World War, but rebuilt in 1958. The old churchyard where Middleton was buried survives as a public park in Elephant and Castle.\nReputation.\nMiddleton's work has long been praised by literary critics, among them Algernon Charles Swinburne and T. S. Eliot. Eliot thought Middleton was second only to Shakespeare.\nMiddleton's plays were staged throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, each decade offering more productions than the last. Even some less familiar works of his have been staged: \"A Fair Quarrel\" at the National Theatre, and \"The Old Law\" by the Royal Shakespeare Company. \"The Changeling\" has been adapted for film several times. The tragedy \"Women Beware Women\" remains a stage favourite. \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" was adapted for Alex Cox's film \"Revengers Tragedy\", the opening credits of which attribute the play's authorship to Middleton.\nWorks.\nMiddleton wrote in many genres, including tragedy, history and city comedy. His best-known plays are the tragedies \"The Changeling\" (with William Rowley) and \"Women Beware Women\", and the cynically satirical city comedy \"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside\". Earlier editions of \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" attributed the play to Cyril Tourneur, or refused to arbitrate between Middleton and Tourneur. However, since the statistical studies by David Lake and MacDonald P. Jackson, Middleton's authorship has not been seriously contested, and no further scholar has defended the Tourneur attribution. The Oxford Middleton and its companion piece, \"Thomas Middleton and Early Modern Textual Culture\", offer extensive evidence both for Middleton's authorship of \"The Revenger's Tragedy\", for his collaboration with Shakespeare on \"Timon of Athens\", and for his adaptation and revision of Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" and \"Measure for Measure\". It has also been argued that Middleton collaborated with Shakespeare on \"All's Well That Ends Well\".\nMiddleton's work is diverse even by the standards of his age. He did not have the kind of official relationship with a particular company that Shakespeare or Fletcher had. Instead he appears to have written on a freelance basis for any number of companies. His output ranges from the \"snarling\" satire of \"Michaelmas Term\" (performed by the Children of Paul's) to the bleak intrigues of \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (performed by the King's Men). His early work was informed by the flourishing of satire in the late Elizabethan period, while his maturity was influenced by the ascendancy of Fletcherian tragicomedy. His later work, in which his satirical fury is tempered and broadened, includes three of his acknowledged masterpieces. \"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside\", produced by the Lady Elizabeth's Men, skilfully combines London life with an expansive view of the power of love to effect reconciliation. \"The Changeling\", a late tragedy, returns Middleton to an Italianate setting like that of \"The Revenger's Tragedy\", except that here the central characters are more fully drawn and more compelling as individuals. Similar development can be seen in \"Women Beware Women\".\nMiddleton's plays are marked by often amusingly presented cynicism about the human race. True heroes are a rarity: almost every character is selfish, greedy and self-absorbed. \"A Chaste Maid in Cheapside\" offers a panoramic view of a London populated entirely by sinners, in which no social rank goes unsatirised. In the tragedies \"Women Beware Women\" and \"The Revenger's Tragedy\", amoral Italian courtiers endlessly plot against each other, resulting in a climactic bloodbath. When Middleton does portray good people, the characters have small roles and are shown as flawless.\nAuthor Herbert Jack Heller suggests that Middleton's Calvinistic beliefs are indicated in his biblical commentary pamphlet, \"The Two Gates of Salvation\" (1607).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "63429", "revid": "26928275", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=63429", "title": "Atari 8-bit computers", "text": "1979-1991 home computer series\nThe Atari 8-bit computers, formally launched as the Atari Home Computer System, are a series of home computers introduced by Atari, Inc., in 1979 with the Atari 400 and Atari 800. The architecture is designed around the 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 CPU and three custom coprocessors which provide support for sprites, smooth multidirectional scrolling, four channels of audio, and other features. The graphics and sound are more advanced than most of its contemporaries, and video games are a key part of the software library. The 1980 first-person space combat simulator \"Star Raiders\" is considered the platform's killer app.\nThe Atari 800 was positioned as a high-end model and the 400 as more affordable. The 400 has a pressure-sensitive, spillproof membrane keyboard and initially shipped with a non-upgradable 8 KB of RAM. The 800 has a conventional keyboard, a second cartridge slot, and allows easy RAM upgrades to 48K. Both use identical 6502 CPUs at ( for PAL versions) and coprocessors ANTIC, POKEY, and CTIA/GTIA. The plug-and-play peripherals use the Atari SIO serial bus, and one of the SIO developers eventually went on to co-patent USB (Universal Serial Bus). The architecture of the Atari 8-bit computers was reused in the 1982 Atari 5200 game console, but games for the two systems are incompatible.\nThe 400 and 800 were replaced by multiple computers with identical core technology and different presentation. The 1200XL was released in early 1983 to supplant the 800. It was discontinued in June 1983, but the industrial design carried over to the 600XL and bestselling 800XL released later the same year. After the company was sold and reestablished, Atari Corporation released the 65XE (called the 800XE in some European markets) and 130XE in 1985. The XL and XE are lighter in construction, have two joystick ports instead of four, and Atari BASIC is built-in. The 130XE has 128 KB of bank-switched RAM. In 1987, after the Nintendo Entertainment System reignited the console market, Atari Corporation packaged the 65XE as a game console, with an optional keyboard, as the Atari XEGS. It is compatible with 8-bit computer software and peripherals.\nThe 8-bit computers were sold both in computer stores and department stores such as Sears using a demo to attract customers. Two million Atari 8-bit computers were sold during its major production run between late 1979 and mid-1985. The primary global competition came when the similarly equipped Commodore 64 was introduced in August 1982. In 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for the 8-bit line.\nHistory.\nDesign of the \"Home Computer System\" started at Atari as soon as the Atari Video Computer System was released in late 1977. While designing the VCS in 1976, the engineering team from Atari Grass Valley Research Center (originally Cyan Engineering) said the system would have a three-year lifespan before becoming obsolete. They started planning for a console that would be ready to replace it around 1979.\nThey developed essentially a greatly updated version of the VCS, fixing its major limitations, but sharing a similar philosophy. The newer design has better speed, graphics, and sound. Work on the chips for the new system continued throughout 1978 and focused on a much-improved video coprocessor known as the CTIA (the VCS version was the TIA).\nDuring the early development period, the home computer era began in earnest with the TRS-80, PET, and Apple II\u2014what \"Byte\" magazine dubbed the \"1977 Trinity\". Nolan Bushnell sold Atari to Warner Communications for US$ in 1976 to fund the launch of the VCS. In 1978, Warner hired Ray Kassar as CEO of Atari. Kassar wanted the chipset used in a home computer to challenge Apple, so it needed character graphics, some form of expansion for peripherals, and run the then-universal BASIC programming language.\nAtari engineer Jay Miner created a display architecture for the Atari 8-bit computer consisting of two chips. The CTIA chip handles sprites and background graphics, but to reduce load on the main CPU, loading video registers and buffers is delegated to a dedicated microprocessor, the Alphanumeric Television Interface Controller or ANTIC. CTIA and ANTIC work together to produce a complete display, with ANTIC fetching scan line data from a framebuffer and sprite memory in RAM, plus character set bitmaps for character modes, and feeding these to the CTIA. CTIA processes the sprite and playfield data via its own color, sprite, and graphics registers to produce the final color video output.\nThe resulting system was far in advance of anything on the market. Commodore was developing a video driver at the time, but Chuck Peddle, lead designer of the MOS Technology 6502 CPU used in the VCS and the new machines, saw the Atari work during a visit to Grass Valley. He realized the Commodore design would not be competitive but he was under a strict non-disclosure agreement with Atari, and was unable to tell anyone at Commodore to give up on their own design. Peddle later commented that \"the thing that Jay did, just kicked everybody's butt.\"\nDevelopment.\nManagement identified two sweet spots for the new computers: a low-end version known internally as \"Candy\", and a higher-end machine known as \"Colleen\" (named after two Atari secretaries). Atari would market Colleen as a computer and Candy as a game machine or hybrid game console. Colleen includes user-accessible expansion slots for RAM and ROM, two 8\u00a0KB ROM cartridge slots, RF and monitor output (including two pins for separate luma and chroma suitable for superior S-Video output) and a full keyboard. Candy was initially designed as a game console, lacking a keyboard and input/output ports, although an external keyboard was planned for joystick ports 3 and 4. At the time, plans called for both to have a separate audio port supporting cassette tapes as a storage medium.\nA goal for the new systems was user-friendliness. One executive stated, \"Does the end user care about the architecture of the machine? The answer is no. 'What will it do for me?' That's his major concern. ... why try to scare the consumer off by making it so he or she has to have a double E or be a computer programmer to utilize the full capabilities of a personal computer?\" For example, cartridges were expected to make the computers easier to use. To minimize handling of bare circuit boards or chips, as is common with other systems of that period, the computers were designed with enclosed modules for memory, ROM cartridges, with keyed connectors to prevent them being plugged into the wrong slot. The operating system boots automatically, loading drivers from devices on the serial bus (SIO). The disk operating system for managing floppy storage was menu-driven. When no software is loaded, rather than leaving the user at a blank screen or machine language monitor, the OS goes to the \"Memo Pad\" which is a built-in full-screen editor without file storage support.\nAs the design process for the new machines continued, there were questions about what the Candy should be. There was a running argument about whether the keyboard would be external or built-in. By the summer of 1978, education had become a focus for the new systems. The Colleen design was largely complete by May 1978, but in early 1979 the decision was made that Candy would also be a complete computer, but intended for children. As such, it would feature a new keyboard designed to be resistant to liquid spills.\nAtari intended to port Microsoft BASIC to the machine as an 8\u00a0KB ROM cartridge. However, the existing 6502 version from Microsoft was around 7,900\u00a0bytes, leaving no room for extensions for graphics and sound. The company contracted with local consulting firm Shepardson Microsystems to complete the port. They recommended writing a new version from scratch, resulting in Atari BASIC.\nFCC issues.\nTelevisions of the time normally had only one input: the antenna connection. For devices like a computer, the video is generated and then sent to an RF modulator to convert it to antenna-like output. The introduction of many game consoles during this era led to situations where poorly designed modulators generated so much signal as to cause interference with other nearby televisions, even in neighboring houses. In response to complaints, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced new testing standards which are extremely exacting and difficult to meet.\nTo meet the FCC requirements, both new machines were built around cast aluminum shields forming a partial Faraday cage, with the various components screwed onto this internal framework. This resulted in a sturdy computer, at the disadvantage of added manufacturing expense and complexity.\nThe FCC ruling also made it difficult to have any sizable holes in the case, which would allow RF leakage. This eliminated expansion slots or cards that communicated with the outside world via their own connectors. Instead, Atari designed the Serial Input/Output (SIO) computer bus: a system for daisy-chaining multiple, auto-configuring devices to the computer through a single shielded connector. The internal slots are reserved for ROM and RAM modules; they do not have the control lines necessary for a fully functional expansion card, nor room to route a cable outside the case to communicate with external devices.\n400 and 800 release.\nAfter Atari announced its intent to enter the home computer market in December 1978, the Atari 400 and Atari 800 were presented at the Winter CES in January 1979 and shipped in November 1979.\nThe names originally referred to the amount of memory: 4\u00a0KB RAM in the 400 and 8\u00a0KB in the 800. By the time they were released, RAM prices had started to fall, so the machines were both released with 8\u00a0KB, using 4kx1 DRAMs. The user-installable RAM modules in the 800 initially had plastic casings but this caused overheating issues, so the casings were removed. Later, the expansion cover was held down with screws instead of the easier-to-open plastic latches. The computers eventually shipped with maxed-out RAM: 16k and 48k, respectively, using 16kx1 DRAMs.\nBoth models have four joystick ports, permitting four simultaneous players, but only a few games (such as \"M.U.L.E.\") use them all. Paddle controllers are wired in pairs, and \"Super Breakout\" supports eight players. The Atari 400, with a membrane keyboard and single internal ROM slot, outsold the Atari 800 by a 2-to-1 margin. Only one cartridge for the 800's right slot was produced by March 1983, and later machines in the series have only one slot.\n\"Creative Computing\" mentioned the Atari machines in an April 1979 overview of the CES show. Calling Atari \"the videogame people\", it stated they came with \"some fantastic educational, entertainment and home applications software\". In an August 1979 interview Atari's Peter Rosenthal suggested that demand might be low until the 1980\u201381 time frame, when he predicted about one million home computers being sold. The April 1980 issue compared the machines with the Commodore PET, focused mostly on the BASIC dialects. Ted Nelson reviewed the computer in the magazine in June 1980, calling it \"an extraordinary graphics box\". Describing his and a friend's \"shouting and cheering and clapping\" during a demo of \"Star Raiders\", Nelson wrote that he was so impressed that \"I've been in computer graphics for twenty years, and I lay awake night after night trying to understand how the Atari machine did what it did\". He described the machine as \"something else\" but criticized the company for a lack of developer documentation. He concluded by stating \"The Atari is like the human body \u2013 a terrific machine, but (a) they won't give you access to the documentation, and (b) I'd sure like to meet the guy that designed it\". \"Kilobaud Microcomputing\" wrote in September 1980 that the Atari 800 \"looks deceptively like a video game machine, [but had] the strongest and tightest chassis I have seen since Raquel Welch. It weighs about ten pounds ... The large amount of engineering and design in the physical part of the system is evident\". The reviewer praised the documentation as \"show[ing] the way manuals should be done\", and the \"excellent 'feel'\" of the keyboard. \"InfoWorld\" favorably reviewed the 800's performance, graphics, and ROM cartridges, but disliked the documentation and cautioned that the unusual right Shift key location might make the computer \"unsuitable for serious word processing\". There is an \"Atari key\" between the and shift, whereas a typical keyboard would extend the shift key into this area. Noting that the amount of software and hardware available for the computer \"is no match for that of the Apple II or the TRS-80\", the magazine concluded that the 800 \"is an impressive machine that has not yet reached its full computing potential\".\n400/800 evolution.\nIn October\u2013November 1981, Atari began shipping the 400 and 800 with the GTIA chip instead of the CTIA chip used since launch. Existing computers could be upgraded. GTIA adds three graphics modes with more colors, but at a low horizontal resolution (). Some later software relies on GTIA modes such as \"Koronis Rift\" and \"Space Lobsters\".\nCirca 1982, the base memory in both models increased: from 8K to 16K for the Atari 400 and from 16K to 48K for the Atari 800.\nSweet/Liz project.\nThough planning an extensive advertising campaign for 1980, Atari found difficult competition from Commodore, Apple, and Tandy. By mid-1981, it had reportedly lost $10 million on sales of $10\u201313 million from more than 50,000 computers.\nIn 1982, Atari started the Sweet 8 (also called Liz NY) and Sweet 16 projects to create new machines that were easier to build and less costly to produce. Atari ordered a custom 6502 with logic to disable the clock signal, called codice_1, which ANTIC uses to shut off the CPU to access the data/address bus. This \"SALLY\" CPU was incorporated into late-production 400 and 800 models, all XL/XE models, and the Atari 5200 and Atari 7800 consoles.\nMirroring the 400/800, two systems were planned, the 1000 with 16\u00a0KB and the 1000X with 64\u00a0KB, each expandable via a Parallel Bus Interface slot on the back of the machine.\n1200XL.\nThe original Sweet 8/16 plans were dropped and only one machine using elements of the new design was released. Announced at a New York City press conference on December 13, 1982, the 1200XL was presented at the Winter CES on January 6\u20139, 1983. It shipped in March 1983 with 64\u00a0KB of RAM, 2 joysticks ports instead of 4, built-in self test, a redesigned keyboard (with four function keys and a HELP key), redesigned cable port layout, and a case designed by Regan Cheng. There is no PAL version of the 1200XL.\nAnnounced at a retail price of $1000, the 1200XL was released at $. This is $100 less than the announced price of the Atari 800 at its release in 1979, but by this time the 800 was priced much lower.\nThe system uses the SIO port again instead of the Parallel Bus Interface. The +12V pin in the SIO port is not connected, which prevents a few devices from working. The +12V was typically used to power RS-232 devices, which now required an external power source. An improved video circuit provides more chroma for a more colorful image, but the chroma line is not connected to the monitor port, the only place that could make use of it. The operating system has compatibility problems with some older software.\nThe 1200XL was discontinued in June 1983.\n\"Compute!\" stated in an early 1983 editorial that the 1200XL was too expensive; John J. Anderson of \"Creative Computing\" agreed. Bill Wilkinson, author of Atari BASIC, co-founder of Optimized Systems Software, and columnist for \"Compute!\", criticized the computer's features and price. He wrote that the 1200XL was a \"terrific bargain\" if sold for less than $450, but that if it cost more than the 800, \"buy an 800 quick!\"\n600XL and 800XL.\nIn May 1981, the Atari 800's price was $, but by mid-1983, because of price wars in the industry, it was $ and the 400 was under $, down from under $ in 1982. The 1200XL was a flop, and the earlier machines were too expensive to produce to be able to compete at the rapidly falling price points.\nA new lineup was announced at the 1983 Summer Consumer Electronics Show, closely following the original Sweet concepts. The 600XL is essentially the Liz NY model and the spiritual successor of the 400, and the 800XL would replace both the 800 and 1200XL. The machines follow the styling of the 1200XL but are smaller from back to front, and the 600XL is more so.\nAtari had difficulty in transitioning manufacturing to Asia after closing its US factory in 1983. Originally intended to replace the 1200XL in mid-1983, the new models did not arrive until late that year. Although the 600XL/800XL were well positioned in terms of price and features, during the critical Christmas season they were available only in small numbers while the Commodore 64 was widely available. Brian Moriarty stated in \"ANALOG Computing\" that Atari \"fail[ed] to keep up with Christmas orders for the 600 and 800XLs\", reporting that as of late November 1983 the 800XL had not appeared in Massachusetts stores while 600XL \"quantities are so limited that it's almost impossible to obtain\".\nAfter losing $ in the first nine months of the year, Atari that month announced that prices would rise in January, stating that it \"has no intention of participating in these suicidal price wars.\" The 600XL and 800XL's prices in early 1984 were $50 higher than for the VIC-20 and Commodore 64.\n\"ANALOG Computing\", writing about the 600XL in January 1984, stated that \"the Commodore 64 and Tandy CoCo look like toys by comparison.\" The magazine approved of its not using the 1200XL's keyboard layout, and predicted that the XL's parallel bus \"actually makes the 600 \"more\" expandable than a 400 or 800.\" While disapproving of the use of an operating system closer to the 1200XL's than the 400 and 800's, and the \"inadequate and frankly disappointing\" documentation, \"ANALOG\" concluded that \"our first impression ... is mixed but mostly optimistic.\" The magazine warned, however, that because of \"Atari's sluggish marketing\", unless existing customers persuaded others to buy the XL models, \"we'll all end up marching to the beat of a drummer whose initials are IBM.\" By March 1984, all of Atari's computer models were produced in Hong Kong by the Atari-Wong joint venture.\nUnreleased XL models.\nThe high-end 1400XL and 1450XLD were announced alongside the 600XL and 800XL. They added a built-in 300 baud modem and a voice synthesizer, and the 1450XLD has a built-in double-sided floppy disk drive in an enlarged case, with a slot for a second drive. Atari BASIC is built into the ROM and the PBI at the back for external expansion.\nThe 1400XL and the 1450XLD had their delivery dates pushed back, and in the end, the 1400XL was canceled outright, and the 1450XLD so delayed that it would never ship. Other prototypes which never reached market include the 1600XL, 1650XLD, and 1850XLD. The 1600XL was to have been a dual-processor model capable of running 6502 and 80186 code, and the 1650XLD is a similar machine in the 1450XLD case. These were canceled when James J. Morgan became CEO and wanted Atari to return to its video game roots. The 1850XLD was to have been based on the Lorraine chipset which became the Amiga.\nTramiel takeover, declining market.\nCommodore founder Jack Tramiel resigned in January 1984 and in July, he purchased the Atari consumer division from Warner for an extremely low price. No cash was required, and instead Warner had the right to purchase $ in long-term notes and warrants, and Tramiel had an option to buy up to $ in Warner stock. When Tramiel took over, the high-end XL models were canceled and the low-end XLs were redesigned into the XE series. Nearly all research, design, and prototype projects were canceled, including the Amiga-based 1850XLD. Tramiel focused on developing the 68000-based Atari ST computer line and recruiting former Commodore engineers to work on it.\nAtari sold about 700,000 computers in 1984 compared to Commodore's two million. As his new company prepared to ship the Atari\u00a0ST in 1985, Tramiel stated that sales of Atari 8-bit computers were \"very, very slow\". They were never an important part of Atari's business compared to video games, and it is possible that the 8-bit line was never profitable for the company though almost 1.5 million computers had been sold by early 1986.\nBy that year, the Atari software market was decreasing in size. \"Antic\" magazine stated in May 1985 that it had received many letters complaining that software companies were ignoring the Atari market, and urged readers to contact the companies' leaders. \"The Atari 800 computer has been in existence since 1979. Six years is a pretty long time for a computer to last. Unfortunately, its age is starting to show\", \"ANALOG Computing\" wrote in February 1986. The magazine stated that while its software library was comparable in size to that of other computers, \"now\u2014and even more so in the future\u2014there is going to be less software being made for the Atari 8-bit computers\", warning that 1985 only saw a \"trickle\" of major new titles and that 1986 \"will be even leaner\".\n\"Computer Gaming World\" that month stated \"games don't come out for the Atari first anymore\". In April, the magazine published a survey of ten game publishers which found that they planned to release 19 Atari games in 1986, compared to 43 for Commodore\u00a064, 48 for Apple\u00a0II, 31 for IBM\u00a0PC, 20 for Atari ST, and 24 for Amiga. Companies stated that one reason for not publishing for Atari was the unusually high amount of software piracy on the computer, partly caused by the Happy Drive. The magazine warned later that year, \"Is this the end for Atari 800 games? It certainly looks like it might be from where I write\". In 1987, MicroProse confirmed that it would not release \"Gunship\" for the Atari 8-bits, stating that the market was too small.\nXE series.\nThe 65XE and 130XE (XE stands for XL-Compatible Eight-bit) were announced in 1985 at the same time as the Atari 520ST, and they visually resemble the ST. The 65XE has 64 KB of RAM and is functionally equivalent to the 800XL minus the PBI connection. The 130XE has 128 KB of memory, accessible through bank switching. The additional 64K can be used as a RAM drive.\nThe 130XE includes the Enhanced Cartridge Interface (ECI), which is almost compatible with the Parallel Bus Interface, but physically smaller and located next to the standard 400 and 800 compatible cartridge slot. It provides only those signals that do not exist in the latter. ECI peripherals were expected to plug into both the standard Cartridge Interface and the ECI port. Later revisions of the 65XE contain the ECI port.\nThe 65XE was sold as the 800XE in Germany and Czechoslovakia to ride on the popularity of the 800XL in those markets. All 800XE units contain the ECI port.\nXE Game System.\nThe Atari XEGS (XE Game System) was launched in 1987. A repackaged 65XE with a removable keyboard, it boots to the 1981 port of \"Missile Command\" instead of BASIC if the keyboard is disconnected.\nDesign.\nThe Atari machines consist of a 6502 as the main processor, a combination of ANTIC and GTIA chips to provide graphics, and the POKEY chip to handle sound and serial input/output. These support chips are controlled via a series of registers that can be user-controlled via memory load/store instructions running on the 6502. For example, the GTIA uses a series of registers to select colors for the screen; these colors can be changed by inserting the correct values into its registers, which are mapped into the address space that is visible to the 6502. Some of the coprocessors use data stored in RAM, such as ANTIC's display buffer and display list, and GTIA's Player/Missile (sprite) information.\nAtari reportedly spent $10 million to develop its three custom chips. These allow many functions directly in hardware, such as smooth background scrolling, that would need to be done in software in most other systems. Computers running in-store graphics and sound demos were part of Atari's early marketing.\nANTIC.\nANTIC is a microprocessor which processes a sequence of instructions known as a display list. An instruction adds one row of the specified graphics mode to the display. Each mode varies based on whether it represents text or a bitmap, the resolution and number of colors, and its vertical height in scan lines. An instruction also indicates if it contains an interrupt, if fine scrolling is enabled, and optionally where to fetch the display data from memory.\nSince each row can be specified individually, the programmer can create displays containing different text or bitmapped graphics modes on one screen, where the data can be fetched from arbitrary, non-sequential memory addresses.\nANTIC reads this display list and the display data using DMA (Direct Memory Access), then translates the result into a pixel data stream representing the playfield text and graphics. This stream then passes to GTIA which applies the playfield colors and incorporates Player/Missile graphics (sprites) for final output to a TV or composite monitor. Once the display list is set up, the display is generated without any CPU intervention.\nThere are 15 character and bitmap modes. In low-resolution modes, 2 or 4 colors per display line can be set. In high-resolution mode, one color can be set per line, but the luminance values of the foreground and background can be adjusted. High resolution bitmap mode (320x192 graphics) produces NTSC composite artifact colors; these colors do not occur on PAL machines.\nFor text modes, the character set data is pointed to by a register. It defaults to an address in ROM, but if pointed to RAM then a programmer can create custom characters. Depending on the text mode, this data can be on any 1K or 512 byte boundary. Additional registers flip all characters upside down and toggle inverse video.\nThe ANTIC chip allows a variety of Playfield modes and widths, and the original Atari Operating System included with the Atari 800/400 computers provides easy access to a subset of these graphics modes. These are exposed to users through Atari BASIC via the \"GRAPHICS\" command and to some other languages via similar system calls. The later version of the OS used in the XL/XE computers added support for most of these \"missing\" graphics modes.\nANTIC text modes support soft, redefineable character sets. ANTIC has four different methods of glyph rendering related to the text modes: Normal, Descenders, Single color character matrix, and Multiple colors per character matrix.\nThe ANTIC chip uses a display list and other settings to create these modes. Any graphics mode in the default CTIA/GTIA color interpretation can be freely mixed without CPU intervention by changing instructions in the display list.\nThe actual ANTIC screen geometry is not fixed. The hardware can be directed to display a narrow Playfield (128 color clocks/256 hi-res pixels wide), the normal width Playfield (160 color clocks/320 hi-res pixels wide), and a wide, overscan Playfield (192 color clocks/384 hi-res pixels wide) by setting a register value. The operating system's default height for creating graphics modes is 192 scan lines, and ANTIC can display vertical overscan up to 240 TV scan lines tall by creating a custom display list.\nThe display list capabilities provide horizontal and vertical coarse scrolling requiring minimal CPU direction. Furthermore, the ANTIC hardware supports horizontal and vertical fine scrolling\u2014shifting the display of screen data incrementally by single pixels (color clocks) horizontally and single scan lines vertically.\nThe system CPU clock and video hardware are synchronized to one-half the NTSC clock frequency. Consequently, the pixel output of all display modes is based on the size of the NTSC color clock which is the minimum size needed to guarantee correct and consistent color regardless of the pixel location on the screen. The fundamental accuracy of the pixel color output allows horizontal fine scrolling without color \"strobing\"\u2014unsightly hue changes in pixels based on horizontal position caused when signal timing does not provide the TV/monitor hardware adequate time to reach the correct color.\nCTIA/GTIA.\nThe Color Television Interface Adaptor (CTIA) is the graphics chip originally used in the Atari 400 and 800. It is the successor to the TIA chip of the 1977 Atari VCS. According to Joe Decuir, George McLeod designed the CTIA in 1977. It was replaced with the Graphic Television Interface Adaptor (GTIA) in later revisions of the 400 and 800 and all later 8-bit models. GTIA, also designed by McLeod, adds three new playfield graphics modes to ANTIC which enable more colors.\nThe CTIA/GTIA receives Playfield graphics information from ANTIC and applies colors to the pixels from a 128 or 256 color palette depending on the color interpretation mode in effect. CTIA/GTIA controls Player/Missile Graphics (sprites) including collision detection between players, missiles, and the playfield; display priority for objects; and color/luminance control of all displayed objects. CTIA/GTIA outputs separate digital luminance and chroma signals, which are mixed to form an analog composite video signal.\nCTIA/GTIA reads the joystick triggers and the Option, Select and Start keys, and controls the keyboard speaker in the Atari 400 and 800. In later computer models the audio output for the keyboard speaker is mixed with the audio out for transmission to the TV/video monitor.\nPOKEY.\nPOKEY is a custom chip used for reading the keyboard, paddles, generating sound and serial communications, commands and IRQs, plus (in conjunction with the Peripheral Interface Adapter chip with two 8-bit bidirectional ports) controlling the 4 joystick movements on the 400 and 800 models, and later RAM banks or ROM (OS/BASIC/Self-test) enables for XL/XE lines. It provides timers, a random number generator for generating acoustic noise and random numbers, and maskable interrupts. POKEY has four semi-independent audio channels, each with its own frequency, noise and volume control. Each 8-bit channel has its own audio control register which select the noise content and volume. For higher sound frequency resolution (quality), two of the audio channels can be combined for more accurate sound (frequency can be defined with 16-bit value instead of usual 8-bit). The name POKEY comes from the words \"POtentiometer\" and \"KEYboard\", which are two of the I/O devices that POKEY interfaces with (the potentiometer is the mechanism used by the paddle). The POKEY chip\u2014and its dual- and quad-core versions\u2014was used in many Atari coin-op arcade machines of the 1980s, including \"Centipede\" and \"Millipede\", \"Missile Command\", \"Asteroids Deluxe\", \"Major Havoc\", and \"\".\nModels.\nAtari, Inc. shipped three updated versions of the 400/800 using the same chipset and with a different case aesthetic: the short-lived 1200XL, then the 600XL and 800XL. Numerous other, wide-ranging projects to develop successors to the 8-bit line were cancelled. After the re-establishment of Atari as Atari Corporation, three more systems were released using largely the same technology as earlier machines: the 65XE and 128 KB 130XE in 1985, and finally the game console inspired Atari XEGS in 1987.\nProduction timeline.\nThe production timeline is from 1979 to 1987.\nPeripherals.\nDuring the lifetime of the 8-bit series, Atari released a large number of peripherals including cassette tape drives, 5.25-inch floppy drives, printers, modems, a touch tablet, and an 80-column display module.\nAtari's peripherals use the proprietary Atari SIO port, which allows them to be daisy chained together. A primary goal of the Atari computer design was user-friendliness which was assisted by the SIO bus. Since only one kind of connector plug is used for all devices the Atari computer was easy for novice users to expand. Atari SIO devices use an early form of plug-n-play. Peripherals on the bus have their own IDs, and can deliver downloadable drivers to the Atari computer during the boot process. The additional electronics in these peripherals made them cost more than the equivalent \"dumb\" devices used by other systems of the era.\nSoftware.\nAtari did not initially disclose technical information for its computers, except to software developers who agreed to keep it secret, possibly to increase its own software sales. Cartridge software was so rare at first that \"InfoWorld\" joked in 1980 that Atari owners might have considered turning the slot \"into a fancy ashtray\". The magazine advised them to \"clear out those cobwebs\" for Atari's \"Star Raiders\", which became the platform's killer app, akin to VisiCalc for the Apple II in its ability to persuade customers to buy the computer.\nChris Crawford and others at Atari published detailed technical information in \"De Re Atari\". In 1982, Atari published both the \"Atari Home Computer System Hardware Manual\" and an annotated source listing of the operating system. These resources resulted in many books and articles about programming the computer's custom hardware.\nBecause of graphics superior to those of the Apple II and Atari's home-oriented marketing, games dominated its software library. A 1984 compendium of reviews used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others.\nBuilt-in operating system.\nThe Atari 8-bit computers have an operating system built into the ROM. The Atari 400 and 800 have two versions:\nThe XL/XE all have OS revisions, which created compatibility issues with certain software. Atari responded with the Translator Disk, a floppy disk which loads the older 400 and 800 Rev. 'B' or Rev. 'A' OS into the XL/XE computers.\nThe XL/XE models that followed the 1200XL also have the Atari BASIC ROM built-in, which can be disabled at startup by holding down the silver codice_2 key. Originally this was revision B, which has some serious bugs. Later models have revision C.\nDisk Operating System.\nThe standard Atari OS only contains low-level routines for accessing floppy disk drives. An extra layer, a disk operating system, is required to assist in organizing file system-level disk access. Atari DOS has to be booted from floppy disk at every power-on or reset. Atari DOS is entirely menu-driven.\nThird-party replacement DOSes were also available.\nLegacy.\nAt the beginning of 1992, Atari Corporation officially dropped all remaining support for all the 8-bit computers. In 2006, Curt Vendel, who designed the Atari Flashback, claimed that Atari released the 8-bit chipset into the public domain. There is agreement in the community that Atari authorized the distribution of the Atari 800's ROM with the Xformer 2.5 emulator, which makes the ROM legally available today as freeware.\nOn March 29, 2024, Atari SA and Retro Games Ltd, via the distributor Plaion, released the Atari 400 Mini, at a cost of \u00a399.99 (\u20ac119.99 / $119.99). It is a half-sized scale-model microconsole emulation of the Atari 400, preloaded with 25 games. It comes with an updated Atari CX40 joystick with additional buttons.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". He is an Ent and is said by Gandalf to be \"the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the Sun upon this Middle-earth.\" He lives in the ancient Forest of Fangorn, to which he has given his name. It lies at the southern end of the Misty Mountains. He is described as being about 14 feet (4.5 m) in height, and in appearance similar to a beech or an oak.\nIn \"The Two Towers\", Treebeard meets with Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took, two Hobbits of the Shire. This meeting proves to have consequences that contribute significantly to the story and enables the events that occur in \"The Return of the King\".\nFangorn's forest.\nThe Forest of Fangorn was at the south-eastern end of the Misty Mountains near the Gap of Rohan. The mountains formed the western border of Fangorn. At the end of the mountain range stood Saruman's stronghold of Isengard near the southwestern corner of the forest. To the east and south of Fangorn was the land of Rohan, and Lothl\u00f3rien lay to the north and slightly east. Fangorn Forest stretched for many miles and held many paths.\nTwo significant rivers ran through the forest. To the north the Limlight flowed from the woods and then formed the northern border of Rohan. The river then merged into the larger Anduin. In the south, the Entwash spread deep into the forest arriving from Methedras, a mountainous region located near the Misty Mountains. The river then flowed through Rohan to the great river, the Anduin. The valley of Derndingle was to the south-west. There was a path where the Entwash passed into a region called Wellinghall with one of Treebeard's homes.\nFangorn Forest was said to be humid, and trunks and branches of many kinds of tree grew thick, allowing little light to penetrate. Huorns also lived deep within the forest, like Ents but more discreet. The Ents and Huorns drank from the river Entwash, and from it the Ents brewed their legendary drink, the Ent-draughts.\nFictional biography.\nEnts were created in the Elder Days to be the \"Shepherds of the Trees\" and protect trees from the anticipated destruction that Dwarves would cause. In \"The Lord of the Rings\", Treebeard recounts to the hobbits Merry and Pippin how the Ents were \"awakened\" and taught to speak by the Elves. He says that only three Ents remain from the Elder Days: himself, Leaflock and Skinbark. He recalls when he could walk through the woods of Middle-earth for days. He sings a song about roaming the woods of Middle-earth, naming regions of Beleriand which were destroyed in the war with Morgoth and now lie \"beneath the waves.\" He says there are valleys in Fangorn forest where the Great Darkness, the period of Morgoth's rule before the arising of the Moon and Sun, never lifted, and the trees are older than he.\nTreebeard is described in some detail:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTreebeard learns that the hobbits think that Gandalf is dead, though apparently he knows otherwise. He takes them to a place called Wellinghall, where the hobbits tell him their adventures and of Saruman's treachery. Treebeard replies that there is \"something very big going on, that I can see\", and comments that the hobbits \"seem to be caught up in a great storm.\"\nTreebeard muses, \"I must do something, I suppose.\" He recalls although he told Saruman many things, Saruman never told him anything. He realizes that Saruman is plotting to be \"a Power\", and wonders what evil he is really doing: why has Saruman taken up with Orcs, why there are so many Orcs in his woods, and why these Orcs are able to bear sunlight. He is angered by trees being felled \"to feed the fires of Orthanc\". He overcomes his anger and then, thinking aloud, begins to make plans for the next day, and tells Merry and Pippin about the Entwives. \nThe next day, Treebeard announces that he has been busy, and they will drink and then go to the Entmoot, a gathering of Ents. He carries them there; the gathering lasts three days. It ends with all the Ents shouting, and then singing a marching song and striding to Isengard with Treebeard in the lead: \"the last march of the Ents\", as Treebeard calls it. Huorns follow, marching, as they later discover, to the Battle of Helm's Deep.\nThe Ents arrive at Isengard as Saruman's army is leaving, and they wait until it has gone. Treebeard bangs on the gates and shouts for Saruman to come forth. Saruman refuses, and the Ents attack. They reduce the outer walls to rubble and destroy much of what is inside. Treebeard gets the Ents to divert the river Isen, drowning the ruined fortress and its underground furnaces and workshops. Saruman is left in the impregnable tower, surrounded by water and watchful Ents.\nA delegation led by Gandalf arrives at Isengard and, except for Gandalf, are amazed that it has been destroyed. Treebeard promises that Saruman will remain in the tower.\nTreebeard is still at Isengard, now renamed the Treegarth of Orthanc, when a group led by Aragorn, King of Gondor, arrives after the victory over Sauron, made possible partly because the Ents had helped to destroy Saruman's forces. Treebeard admits that he had let Saruman go. Gandalf gently chastises him, saying that Saruman might have persuaded Treebeard to let him go by \"the poison of his voice.\" Treebeard delivers the keys of Orthanc to the King, who gives the valley of Orthanc to Treebeard and his ents.\nIn-fiction origins.\nIn Sindarin, one of Tolkien's Elvish languages, \"Fangorn\" is a compound of \"fanga\", \"beard\", and \"orne\", \"tree\", so it is the equivalent of the English \"Treebeard\". The Riders of Rohan called Fangorn Forest the \"Entwood\", the wood of the Ents. Treebeard gave it various names in Quenya, another Elvish language: \"Ambar\u00f3na\" means \"uprising, sunrise, orient\" from \"amba\", \"upwards\" and \"r\u00f3na\", \"east\". \"Aldal\u00f3m\u00eb\" means \"tree twilight\" from \"alda\", \"tree\" and \"l\u00f3m\u00eb\", \"dusk, twilight\". \"Tauremorna\" means \"gloomy forest\" from \"taur\", \"forest\", and \"morna\", \"gloomy\". \"Tauremornal\u00f3m\u00eb\" means \"gloomy twilight forest\". \nAnalysis.\nMedieval echoes.\nThe word \"Ent\" was taken from the Old English \"ent\" or \"eoten\", meaning \"giant\". Tolkien borrowed the word from a phrase in the Anglo-Saxon poems \"The Ruin\" and \"Maxims II\", \"or\u00feanc enta geweorc\" (\"cunning work of giants\"), which describes Roman ruins in Britain.\nThe philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that Treebeard says farewell to the elf-rulers Celeborn and Galadriel \"with great reverence\" and the words \"It is long, long since we met by stock or by stone\", in words which echo a line in the Middle English poem \"Pearl\": \"We meten so selden by stok other stone\". Where in \"Pearl\" the mention of stock and stone means in earthy reality, Shippey writes, the phrase fits the Fangorn context well, since Treebeard's \"sense of ultimate loss naturally centres on felled trees and barren ground.\"\nEnvironmentalism.\nMatthew T. Dickerson and Jonathan Evans see Treebeard as vocalizing a vital part of Tolkien's environmental ethic, the need to preserve and look after every kind of wild place, especially forests. Tolkien's biographer John Garth writes that \"A deep feeling for trees is Tolkien's most distinctive response to the natural world.\"\nProfessorial figure.\nShippey, who like Tolkien had been a university professor, writes that Fangorn's explanations are \"authoritative and indeed .. 'professorial'. They admit no denial.\" Tolkien's biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, wrote that Treebeard's deep booming voice with his \"hrum, hoom\" mannerism was based on that of Tolkien's friend, fellow-Inkling, and professor of English at the University of Oxford, C. S. Lewis.\nPortrayal in adaptations.\nTreebeard has inspired artists and illustrators such as Inger Edelfeldt, John Howe, Ted Nasmith, Anke Ei\u00dfmann, and Alan Lee. In Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", John Westbrook provided the voice of Treebeard. Stephen Thorne voiced the character in BBC Radio's 1981 serialization.\nIn Peter Jackson's films ' (2002) and ' (2003), Treebeard is a combination of a large animatronic model and a CGI construct; his voice is performed by John Rhys-Davies, who also portrays Gimli. Jackson's interpretation of Treebeard makes him far more suspicious of the Hobbits (as possible Orcs) than Tolkien does, and far more reluctant to go to war with Saruman until he sees the damage done to the forest.\nA 6-metre-high sculpture of Treebeard by Tolkien's great-nephew Tim Tolkien received planning permission in Birmingham, where Tolkien grew up. On The Tolkien Ensemble's album \"At Dawn in Rivendell\", Treebeard is voiced by Christopher Lee.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also related to six men's morris and nine men's morris. A player wins by forming a mill, that is, three of their own pieces in a row.\nRules.\nEach player has three pieces. The winner is the first player to align their three pieces on a line drawn on the board. There are 3 horizontal lines, 3 vertical lines and 2 diagonal lines.\nThe board is empty to begin the game, and players take turns placing their pieces on empty intersections. Once all pieces are placed (assuming there is no winner by then), play proceeds with each player moving one of their pieces per turn. A piece may move to any vacant point on the board, not just an adjacent one.\nAccording to H. J. R. Murray\u2019s \"A History of Chess\", there is an alternative version in which pieces may not move to any vacant point, but only to any \"adjacent\" linked empty position, i.e. from a corner to the middle of an adjacent edge, from the middle of an edge to the center or an adjacent corner, or from the center to the middle of an edge. Murray calls the first version \"nine holes\" and the second version \"three men's morris\" or \"the smaller merels\".\nIn this variant of the game, there is a winning strategy for the player who goes first, unless the first player is not allowed to place the first piece in the centre, in which case neither player has a winning strategy.\nHistory.\nAccording to R. C. Bell, the earliest known board for the game includes diagonal lines and was \"cut into the roofing slabs of the temple at Kurna in Egypt\"; he estimated a date for them of c.\u20091400\u00a0BCE. However, Friedrich Berger wrote that some of the diagrams at Kurna include Coptic crosses, making it \"doubtful\" that the diagrams date to 1400\u00a0BCE. Berger concluded, \"certainly they cannot be dated.\" When played on this board, the game is called \"tapatan\" in the Philippines and \"luk tsut k'i\" ('six man chess') in China. It is thought that \"luk tsut k'i\" was played during the time of Confucius, c.\u00a0500\u00a0BCE. Centuries later, the game was mentioned in Ovid's \"Ars Amatoria\", according to R. C. Bell. In book III (c.\u00a08\u00a0CE), after discussing , a popular board game, Ovid wrote:http://\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Est genus, in totidem tenui ratione redactum\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 Scriptula, quot menses lubricus annus habet:\n&lt;br&gt;Parva tabella capit ternos utrimque lapillos,\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 In qua vicisse est continuasse suos.\n&lt;br&gt;Mille facesse iocos; turpe est nescire puellam\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 Ludere: ludendo saepe paratur amor.\nThis, translated, says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is a genus, reduced to the same thinness\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 The scriptures, how many months is there in a slippery year:\n&lt;br&gt;A small panel holds three stones on both sides,\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 In which victory he continued his people.\n&lt;br&gt;He would have made a thousand jokes; it is a shame not to know the girl\n&lt;br&gt;\u00a0 To play: love is often prepared by playing.\nThere is another game divided into as many parts as there are months in the year. A table has three pieces on either side; the winner must get all the pieces in a straight line. It is a bad thing for a girl not to know how to play, for love often comes into being during play. Boards were carved into the cloister seats at the English cathedrals at Canterbury, Gloucester, Norwich, Salisbury and Westminster Abbey; the game was quite popular in England in the 13th century. These boards used holes, not lines, to represent the nine spaces on the board\u2014hence the name \"nine-holes\"\u2014and forming a diagonal row did not win the game.\nThe name of the game may be related to Morris dances (and hence to Moorish). However, according to Daniel King, \"the word 'morris' has nothing to do with the old English dance of the same name. It comes from the Latin word , which means a counter or gaming piece.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
