It is one of the final phases of genetic recombination, which occurs in the \"pachytene\" stage of prophase I of meiosis during a process called synapsis. Synapsis is usually initiated before the synaptonemal complex develops and is not completed until near the end of prophase\u00a0I. Crossover usually occurs when matching regions on matching chromosomes break and then reconnect to the other chromosome, resulting in chiasma which are the visible evidence of crossing over. \nHistory of discovery.\nCrossing over was described, in theory, by Thomas Hunt Morgan; the term crossover was coined by Morgan and Eleth Cattell. Hunt relied on the discovery of Frans Alfons Janssens who described the phenomenon in 1909 and had called it \"chiasmatypie\". The term \"chiasma\" is linked, if not identical, to chromosomal crossover. Morgan immediately saw the great importance of Janssens' cytological interpretation of chiasmata to the experimental results of his research on the heredity of \"Drosophila\". The physical basis of crossing over was first demonstrated by Harriet Creighton and Barbara McClintock in 1931.\nThe linked frequency of crossing over between two gene loci (markers) is the \"crossing-over value\". For fixed set of genetic and environmental conditions, recombination in a particular region of a linkage structure (chromosome) tends to be constant and the same is then true for the crossing-over value which is used in the production of genetic maps.\nWhen Hotta et al. in 1977 compared meiotic crossing-over (recombination) in lily and mouse they concluded that diverse eukaryotes share a common pattern. This finding suggested that chromosomal crossing over is a general characteristic of eukaryotic meiosis.\nOrigins.\nThere are two popular and overlapping theories that explain the origins of crossing-over, coming from the different theories on the origin of meiosis. The first theory rests upon the idea that meiosis evolved as another method of DNA repair, and thus crossing-over is a novel way to replace possibly damaged sections of DNA. The second theory comes from the idea that meiosis evolved from bacterial transformation, with the function of propagating diversity.\nIn 1931, Barbara McClintock discovered a triploid maize plant. She made key findings regarding corn's karyotype, including the size and shape of the chromosomes. McClintock used the prophase and metaphase stages of mitosis to describe the morphology of corn's chromosomes, and later showed the first ever cytological demonstration of crossing over in meiosis. Working with student Harriet Creighton, McClintock also made significant contributions to the early understanding of codependency of linked genes.\nDNA repair theory.\nCrossing over and DNA repair are very similar processes, which utilize many of the same protein complexes.\nIn her report, \"The Significance of Responses of the Genome to Challenge\", McClintock studied corn to show how corn's genome would change itself to overcome threats to its survival. She used 450 self-pollinated plants that received from each parent a chromosome with a ruptured end. She used modified patterns of gene expression on different sectors of leaves of her corn plants to show that transposable elements (\"controlling elements\") hide in the genome, and their mobility allows them to alter the action of genes at different loci. These elements can also restructure the genome, anywhere from a few nucleotides to whole segments of chromosome.\nRecombinases and primases lay a foundation of nucleotides along the DNA sequence. One such particular protein complex that is conserved between processes is RAD51, a well conserved recombinase protein that has been shown to be crucial in DNA repair as well as cross over. \nSeveral other genes in \"D. melanogaster\" have been linked as well to both processes, by showing that mutants at these specific loci cannot undergo DNA repair or crossing over. Such genes include mei-41, mei-9, hdm, spnA, and brca2. This large group of conserved genes between processes supports the theory of a close evolutionary relationship.\nFurthermore, DNA repair and crossover have been found to favor similar regions on chromosomes. In an experiment using radiation hybrid mapping on wheat's (\"Triticum aestivum L.\") 3B chromosome, crossing over and DNA repair were found to occur predominantly in the same regions. Furthermore, crossing over has been correlated to occur in response to stressful, and likely DNA damaging, conditions.\nLinks to bacterial transformation.\nThe process of bacterial transformation also shares many similarities with chromosomal cross over, particularly in the formation of overhangs on the sides of the broken DNA strand, allowing for the annealing of a new strand. Bacterial transformation itself has been linked to DNA repair many times. The second theory comes from the idea that meiosis evolved from bacterial transformation, with the function of propagating genetic diversity. Thus, this evidence suggests that it is a question of whether cross over is linked to DNA repair or bacterial transformation, as the two do not appear to be mutually exclusive. It is likely that crossing over may have evolved from bacterial transformation, which in turn developed from DNA repair, thus explaining the links between all three processes. \nBiochemistry of meiotic recombination.\nMeiotic recombination may be initiated by double-stranded breaks that are introduced into the DNA by exposure to DNA damaging agents, or the Spo11 protein. One or more exonucleases then digest the 5' ends generated by the double-stranded breaks to produce 3' single-stranded DNA tails (see diagram). The meiosis-specific recombinase Dmc1 and the general recombinase Rad51 coat the single-stranded DNA to form nucleoprotein filaments. The recombinases catalyze invasion of the opposite chromatid by the single-stranded DNA from one end of the break. Next, the 3' end of the invading DNA primes DNA synthesis, causing displacement of the complementary strand, which subsequently anneals to the single-stranded DNA generated from the other end of the initial double-stranded break. The structure that results is a \"cross-strand exchange\", also known as a Holliday junction. The contact between two chromatids that will soon undergo crossing-over is known as a \"chiasma\". The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral structure which can be 'pulled' by other recombinases, moving it along the four-stranded structure.\nMSH4 and MSH5.\nThe MSH4 and MSH5 proteins form a hetero-oligomeric structure (heterodimer) in yeast and humans. In the yeast \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\", MSH4 and MSH5 act specifically to facilitate crossovers between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The MSH4/MSH5 complex binds and stabilizes double Holliday junctions and promotes their resolution into crossover products. An MSH4 hypomorphic (partially functional) mutant of \"S. cerevisiae\" showed a 30% genome-wide reduction in crossover numbers and a large number of meioses with non-exchange chromosomes. Nevertheless, this mutant gave rise to spore viability patterns suggesting that segregation of non-exchange chromosomes occurred efficiently. Thus in \"S. cerevisiae\" proper segregation apparently does not entirely depend on crossovers between homologous pairs. In humans, biallelic loss of function variants to MSH4 and MSH5 are compatible with life, but are associated with azoospermia in males (spermatogenic failure) and premature ovarian failure in females.\nChiasma.\nChiasma (plural: chiasmata) are essential for the correct alignment and segregation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis I, and their frequency reflects the rate of genetic recombination, which contributes to variation among offspring. Chiasma number tends to increase with genome size, as larger genomes generally undergo more crossover events per meiosis. Each homologous pair forms a bivalent (or tetrad), consisting of four chromatids. The number and position of chiasmata influence the shape of bivalents, rod-shaped with one chiasma and ring-shaped with two or more. \nThe grasshopper \"Melanoplus femur-rubrum\" was exposed to an acute dose of X-rays during each individual stage of meiosis, and chiasma frequency was measured. Irradiation during the leptotene-zygotene stages of meiosis (that is, prior to the pachytene period in which crossover recombination occurs) was found to increase subsequent chiasma frequency. Similarly, in the grasshopper \"Chorthippus brunneus\", exposure to X-irradiation during the zygotene-early pachytene stages caused a significant increase in mean cell chiasma frequency. Chiasma frequency was scored at the later diplotene-diakinesis stages of meiosis. These results show that ionising-radiation induced double-stranded DNA breaks were subsequently repaired by a crossover pathway leading to chiasma formation.\nHowever, increased crossover frequency following radiation-induced DNA damage does not universally occur in all insects; for example, \"Drosophila\" females exhibit predominantly non-crossover repair pathways when responding to induced double-stranded DNA breaks, resulting in a relatively low ratio of crossovers to non-crossovers.\nClass I and class II crossovers.\nDouble-strand breaks are repaired by two pathways to generate crossovers in eukaryotes. The majority of them are repaired by MutL homologs MLH1 and MLH3, which defines the class I crossovers. The remaining are the result of the class II pathway, which is regulated by MUS81 endonuclease and FANCM translocase. There are interconnections between these two pathways\u2014class I crossovers can compensate for the loss of class II pathway. In MUS81 knockout mice, class I crossovers are elevated, while total crossover counts at chiasmata are normal. However, the mechanisms underlining this crosstalk are not well understood. A recent study suggests that a scaffold protein called SLX4 may participate in this regulation. Specifically, SLX4 knockout mice largely phenocopies the MUS81 knockout\u2014once again, an elevated class I crossovers while normal chiasmata count. In FANCM knockout mice, the class II pathway is hyperactivated, resulting in increased numbers of crossovers that are independent of the MLH1/MLH3 pathway.\nConsequences.\nIn most eukaryotes, a cell carries two versions of each gene, each referred to as an allele. Each parent passes on one allele to each offspring. An individual gamete inherits a complete haploid complement of alleles on chromosomes that are independently selected from each pair of chromatids lined up on the metaphase plate. Without recombination, all alleles for those genes linked together on the same chromosome would be inherited together. Meiotic recombination allows a more independent segregation between the two alleles that occupy the positions of single genes, as recombination shuffles the allele content between homologous chromosomes.\nRecombination results in a new arrangement of maternal and paternal alleles on the same chromosome. Although the same genes appear in the same order, some alleles are different. In this way, it is theoretically possible to have any combination of parental alleles in an offspring, and the fact that two alleles appear together in one offspring does not have any influence on the statistical probability that another offspring will have the same combination. This principle of \"independent assortment\" of genes is fundamental to genetic inheritance.\nHowever, the frequency of recombination is actually not the same for all gene combinations. This leads to the notion of \"genetic distance\", which is a measure of recombination frequency averaged over a (suitably large) sample of pedigrees. Loosely speaking, one may say that this is because recombination is greatly influenced by the proximity of one gene to another. If two genes are located close together on a chromosome, the likelihood that a recombination event will separate these two genes is less than if they were farther apart. Genetic linkage describes the tendency of genes to be inherited together as a result of their location on the same chromosome. Linkage disequilibrium describes a situation in which some combinations of genes or genetic markers occur more or less frequently in a population than would be expected from their distances apart. This concept is applied when searching for a gene that may cause a particular disease. This is done by comparing the occurrence of a specific DNA sequence with the appearance of a disease. When a high correlation between the two is found, it is likely that the appropriate gene sequence is really closer\nRecombination-associated mutagenesis.\nAlthough crossing over increases genetic variation by reshuffling existing alleles, the repair of programmed meiotic double-strand breaks can also introduce new mutations. In humans, sequencing of crossover molecules at recombination hotspots found that crossovers can carry more de novo mutations than nonrecombinant DNA molecules from the same donors and hotspots. Larger-scale analyses further suggest meiotic break repair can be strongly mutagenic, with especially large increases in rates of indels and structural variants per break. In plants, parent\u2013progeny sequencing in Arabidopsis reported mutation rates elevated in proximity to crossover events.\nNon-homologous crossover.\nCrossovers typically occur between homologous regions of matching chromosomes, but similarities in sequence and other factors can result in mismatched alignments. Most DNA is composed of base pair sequences repeated very large numbers of times. These repetitious segments, often referred to as satellites, are fairly homogeneous among a species. During DNA replication, each strand of DNA is used as a template for the creation of new strands using a partially-conserved mechanism; proper functioning of this process results in two identical, paired chromosomes, often called sisters. Sister chromatid crossover events are known to occur at a rate of several crossover events per cell per division in eukaryotes. Most of these events involve an exchange of equal amounts of genetic information, but unequal exchanges may occur due to sequence mismatch. These are referred to by a variety of names, including non-homologous crossover, unequal crossover, and unbalanced recombination, and result in an insertion or deletion of genetic information into the chromosome. While rare compared to homologous crossover events, these mutations are drastic, affecting many loci at the same time. They are considered the main driver behind the generation of gene duplications and are a general source of mutation within the genome.\nThe specific causes of non-homologous crossover events are unknown, but several influential factors are known to increase the likelihood of an unequal crossover. One common vector leading to unbalanced recombination is the repair of double-strand breaks. Double-stranded DNA breaks are often repaired using homology directed repair, a process which involves invasion of a template strand by the double-stranded DNA break strand (see figure below). Nearby homologous regions of the template strand are often used for repair, which can give rise to either insertions or deletions in the genome if a non-homologous but complementary part of the template strand is used. Sequence similarity is a major player in crossover \u2013 crossover events are more likely to occur in long regions of close identity on a gene. This means that any section of the genome with long sections of repetitive DNA is prone to crossover events.\nThe presence of transposable elements is another influential element of non-homologous crossover. Repetitive regions of code characterize transposable elements; complementary but non-homologous regions are ubiquitous within transposons. Because chromosomal regions composed of transposons have large quantities of identical, repetitious code in a condensed space, it is thought that transposon regions undergoing a crossover event are more prone to erroneous complementary match-up; that is to say, a section of a chromosome containing a lot of identical sequences, should it undergo a crossover event, is less certain to match up with a perfectly homologous section of complementary code and more prone to binding with a section of code on a slightly different part of the chromosome. This results in unbalanced recombination, as genetic information may be either inserted or deleted into the new chromosome, depending on where the recombination occurred.\nWhile the motivating factors behind unequal recombination remain obscure, elements of the physical mechanism have been elucidated. Mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, for instance, are a well-known regulatory family of proteins, responsible for regulating mismatched sequences of DNA during replication and escape regulation. The operative goal of MMRs is the restoration of the parental genotype. One class of MMR in particular, MutS\u03b2, is known to initiate the correction of insertion-deletion mismatches of up to 16 nucleotides. Little is known about the excision process in eukaryotes, but \"E. coli\" excisions involve the cleaving of a nick on either the 5' or 3' strand, after which DNA helicase and DNA polymerase III bind and generate single-stranded proteins, which are digested by exonucleases and attached to the strand by ligase. Multiple MMR pathways have been implicated in the maintenance of complex organism genome stability, and any of many possible malfunctions in the MMR pathway result in DNA editing and correction errors. Therefore, while it is not certain precisely what mechanisms lead to errors of non-homologous crossover, it is extremely likely that the MMR pathway is involved.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was first published in July 1828, making it the oldest surviving magazine in the world. \"The Spectator\" is politically conservative, and its principal subject areas are politics and culture. Alongside columns and features on current affairs, the magazine also contains arts pages on books, music, opera, film, and TV reviews. It had an average circulation of 107,812 as of December 2023, excluding Australia.\nEditorship of the magazine has often been a step on the ladder to high office in the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom; its past editors include Boris Johnson (1999\u20132005) and other former cabinet members Ian Gilmour (1954\u20131959), Iain Macleod (1963\u20131965), and Nigel Lawson (1966\u20131970). The former Conservative MP Michael Gove took over from Fraser Nelson as editor on 4 October 2024.\nToday, the magazine is a print-digital hybrid. In 2020, \"The Spectator\" became the longest-lived current affairs magazine in history (overtaking \"The Gentleman's Magazine\", which published from 1731 to 1922), and was also the first magazine ever to publish 10,000 issues. In September 2024, \"The Spectator\" was acquired by British hedge fund manager Paul Marshall, owner of UnHerd and co-owner of GB News.\nHistory.\nRobert Stephen Rintoul.\n\"The Spectator\"'s founder, Scottish reformer Robert Stephen Rintoul, former editor of the \"Dundee Advertiser\" and the London-based \"Atlas\", launched the paper on 6 July 1828. Rintoul consciously revived the title from the celebrated, if short-lived, daily publication by Joseph Addison and Richard Steele. As he had long been determined \"to edit a perfect newspaper\", Rintoul initially insisted on \"absolute power\" over content, commencing a long-lasting tradition of the paper's editor and proprietor being one and the same person. Although he wrote little himself, \"every line and word passed through the alembic of his brain.\"\n\"The Spectator\"'s political outlook in its first thirty years reflected Rintoul's liberal-radical agenda. Despite its political stance, it was widely regarded and respected for its non-partisanship, in both its political and cultural criticism. Rintoul initially advertised his new title as a \"family paper\", the euphemistic term for a journal free from strong political rhetoric, but events soon compelled him to confess that it was no longer possible to be \"a mere Spectator\". Two years into its existence, \"The Spectator\" came out strongly for wide-reaching parliamentary reform: it produced supplements detailing vested interests in the Commons and Lords, coined the well-known phrase \"The Bill, the whole Bill and nothing but the Bill\", and helped drive through the Great Reform Act of 1832. Virulently anti-Tory in its politics, \"The Spectator\" strongly objected to the appointment of the Duke of Wellington as prime minister, condemning him as \"a Field Marshal whose political career proves him to be utterly destitute of political principle\u00a0\u2013 whose military career affords ample evidence of his stern and remorseless temperament.\"\nThe paper spent its first century at premises on Wellington Street (now Lancaster Place). Despite its robust criticism of the Conservative Party leader Robert Peel for several years, \"The Spectator\" rallied behind him when he split the Tory party by successfully repealing the Corn Laws. Rintoul's fundamental principles were freedom of the individual, freedom of the press and freedom of trade, of religious tolerance and freedom from blind political adherence. The magazine was vocal in its opposition to the First Opium War (1839\u20131842), commenting that \"all the alleged aims of the expedition against China are vague, illimitable, and incapable of explanation, save only that of making the Chinese pay the opium-smugglers.\" The magazine further wrote: \"There does not appear to be much glory gained in a contest so unequal that hundreds are killed on one side and none on the other. What honour is there in going to shoot men, certain that they cannot hurt you? The cause of the war, be it remembered, is as disreputable as the strength of the parties is unequal. The war is undertaken in support of a co-partnery of opium-smugglers, in which the Anglo-Indian Government may be considered as the principal partner.\"\nIn 1853, \"The Spectator\"'s lead book reviewer George Brimley published an anonymous and unfavourable notice of Charles Dickens's \"Bleak House\", typical of the paper's enduring contempt for him as a \"popular\" writer \"amusing the idle hours of the greatest number of readers; not, we may hope, without improvement to their hearts, but certainly without profoundly affecting their intellects or deeply stirring their emotions.\" Rintoul died in April 1858, having sold the magazine two months earlier. The circulation had already been falling, under particular pressure from its new rival, \"The Saturday Review\". Its new owner, the 27-year-old John Addyes Scott, kept the purchase quiet, but Rintoul's death made explicit the change of guard. His tenure was unremarkable, and subscribers continued to fall. By the end of the year, Scott sought his escape, selling the title for \u00a34,200 in December 1858 () to two British-based Americans, James McHenry and Benjamin Moran. While McHenry was a businessman, Moran was an assistant secretary to the American ambassador, George M. Dallas; they saw their purchase as a means to influence British opinion on American affairs.\nThe editor was Thornton Leigh Hunt, a friend of Moran who had also worked for Rintoul. Hunt was also nominally the purchaser, having been given the necessary monies in an attempt by McHenry and Moran to disguise the American ownership. Circulation declined with this loss of independence and inspirational leadership, as the views of James Buchanan, then President of the United States, came to the fore. Within weeks, as the last pre-American ownership issue appears to have been that of 25 December 1858. the editorial line followed Buchanan's pronouncements in being \"neither pro-slavery nor pro-abolitionist. To unsympathetic observers Buchanan's policy seemed to apportion blame for the impasse on the slavery question equally on pro-slavery and abolitionist factions \u2013 and rather than work out a solution, simply to argue that a solution would take time. \"The Spectator\" now would publicly support that 'policy'\". This set it at odds with most of the British press, but gained it the sympathy of expatriate Americans in the country. Richard Fulton notes that from then until 1861, \"the \"Spectator\"'s commentary on American affairs read like a Buchanan administration propaganda sheet.\" and that this represented a \"volte-face\". Under Hunt's tenure, \"The Spectator\" may even have been steered by financial support from the court of Napoleon III.\nMeredith Townsend, Richard Holt Hutton, and John St Loe Strachey.\nThe need to promote the Buchanan position in Britain had been reduced as British papers such as \"The Times\" and \"The Saturday Review\" turned in his favour, fearing the potential effects of a split in the Union. As Abraham Lincoln was set to succeed the vacillating Buchanan after the 1860 United States presidential election, the owners decided to stop pumping money into a loss-making publication: as Moran confided to his diary, \"it don't pay, never did since Hunt became its owner.\" On 19 January 1861, \"The Spectator\" was sold to a journalist, Meredith Townsend, for the marked-down sum of \u00a32,000. Though not yet thirty, Townsend had spent the previous decade as an editor in India, and was prepared to restore to the paper an independent voice in a fast-changing world. From the outset, Townsend took up an anti-Buchanan, anti-slavery position, arguing that his unwillingness to act decisively had been a weakness and a contributor to the problems apparent in the US. He soon went into partnership with Richard Holt Hutton, the editor of \"The Economist\", whose primary interests were literature and theology. Hutton's close friend William Gladstone later called him \"the first critic of the nineteenth century\". Townsend's writing in \"The Spectator\" confirmed him as one of the finest journalists of his day, and he has since been called \"the greatest leader writer ever to appear in the English Press.\"\nThe two men remained co-proprietors and joint editors for 25 years, taking a strong stand on some of the most controversial issues of their day. They supported the Union against the Confederacy in the American Civil War, an unpopular position which, at the time, did serious damage to the paper's circulation, reduced to some 1,000 readers. The issue of 25 January 1862, published in the wake of the Trent Affair, argued that \"The Southern Bid\" for active support in return for an Abolition promise, \"demands careful examination\". In time, the paper regained readers when the victory of the North validated its principled stance. They also launched an all-out assault on Benjamin Disraeli, accusing him in a series of leaders of jettisoning ethics for politics by ignoring the atrocities committed against Bulgarian civilians by the Ottoman Empire in the 1870s.\nIn 1886, \"The Spectator\" parted company with William Ewart Gladstone when he declared his support for Irish Home Rule. Committed to defending the Union ahead of the Liberal Party line, Townsend and Hutton aligned themselves with the Liberal Unionist wing. As a result, H. H. Asquith (the future Prime Minister), who had served as a leader-writer for ten years, left his post. Townsend was succeeded by a young journalist named John St Loe Strachey, who would remain associated with the paper for the next 40 years. When Hutton died in 1897, Strachey became co-owner with Townsend; by the end of the year Strachey was made sole editor and proprietor. As chief leader-writer, general manager, literary critic and all things beside, Strachey embodied the spirit of \"The Spectator\" until the 1920s. Among his various schemes were the establishment of a Spectator Experimental Company, to show that new soldiers could be trained up to excellence in six months, the running of a Cheap Cottage Exhibition, which laid the foundations for Letchworth Garden City, and the impassioned defence of Free Trade against Joseph Chamberlain's protectionist 'Tariff Reform' programme.\nWithin two years he had doubled the paper's circulation, which peaked at 23,000. In the early decades of the twentieth century it was heralded as \"the most influential of all the London weeklies\". The First World War put the paper and its editor under great strain: after the conflict it seemed to be behind the times, and circulation began to fall away. Even the introduction of signed articles, overturning the paper's fixed policy of anonymity for its first century, did little to help. After years of illness, Strachey decided at the end of 1924 to sell his controlling interest in the paper to his recently appointed business manager, Evelyn Wrench. Although he gained a second wind as a novelist, Strachey died two years later in 1928.\n1925\u20131975.\nEvelyn Wrench and Wilson Harris.\nFor his first year as proprietor, John Evelyn Wrench appointed John (Jack) Atkins his editor, who had worked on the paper for the last two decades, acting as editor during Strachey's recurrent bouts of illness. But the relationship did not work: as Atkins lamented to his long-standing friend, Winston Churchill, Wrench \"continually wants to interfere and he is very ignorant\". Wrench duly took over the editorship in 1926, successfully channeling the enthusiasm of Strachey. His global connections helped secure interviews with Henry Ford, Mahatma Gandhi and Benito Mussolini. Perhaps his most remembered achievement as editor of \"The Spectator\" was the campaign to ease unemployment in the mining town of Aberdare, one of the worst hit by the crisis of 1928, when joblessness reached 40% in South Wales. Within three months, the paper's appeal for the town's relief raised over \u00a312,000 (). A statuette of an Aberdare miner, presented in gratitude to \"The Spectator\", still sits in the editor's office, bearing the inscription: \"From the Townsfolk of Aberdare in Grateful Recognition: 'The Greatest of These is Love'\".\nWrench retired as editor in 1932 (he remained the magazine's proprietor), appointing the political editor Wilson Harris his successor. Under Harris \"The Spectator\" became increasingly outspoken on developing international politics in the 1930s, in particular on the rise of fascism. Beneath a reader's letter referring to the Nazi Party as \"peaceful, orderly and kindly\", Harris printed the following reply:\nNo facts in recent history are established more incontestably\u00a0... than the numerous cases of murder, assault, and various forms of intimidation for which the National Socialist Party in Germany has been responsible\u00a0... The organized economic boycott of the Jews is the climax. \"The Spectator\" has consistently shown itself a friend of Germany, but it is a friend of freedom first. Resort to violence is not condoned by styling it revolution. \nHarris broadly supported the European foreign policy of the Chamberlain ministry and Neville Chamberlain's appeasement. He praised the Munich agreement, explaining later that he believed \"even the most desperate attempt to save the peace was worthwhile\". Harris abandoned the newspaper's support for appeasement after the Kristallnacht pogrom, which Harris wrote \"obliterated the word appeasement.\" When the conflict broke, the team abandoned their Gower Street office for Harmondsworth, but within a few days decided to return to London: the basement caught fire from shrapnel, and the printers were bombed, but the paper continued to appear each week. Although the Second World War required \"The Spectator\" to downgrade its size and paper quality, its readership doubled during the conflict, exceeding 50,000. From 1945 to 1950, Harris served as MP for Cambridge University; although he stood as an independent, this was the first formal overlap between \"The Spectator\" and the House of Commons. In February 1947, when a fuel shortage suspended the publication of weekly magazines, \"The Spectator\" appeared in an abridged form over two successive Thursdays on page 2 of the \"Daily Mail\".\nIan Gilmour.\nIn 1954, Wrench and his co-owner Angus Watson sold \"The Spectator\" to the barrister Ian Gilmour, who restored the \"Spectator\" tradition of simultaneously acting as editor. Having a libertarian and pro-European outlook, he \"enlivened the paper and injected a new element of irreverence, fun and controversy\". He was critical of both Anthony Eden's and Harold Macmillan's governments, and while supporting the Conservatives was also friendly to Hugh Gaitskell and Gaitskellism. Gilmour lent \"The Spectator\"'s voice to the campaign to end capital punishment in Britain, writing an incensed leader attacking the hanging of Ruth Ellis in 1955, in which he claimed \"Hanging has become the national sport\", and that the home secretary Gwilym Lloyd George, for not reprieving the sentence, \"has now been responsible for the hanging of two women over the past eight months\".\n\"The Spectator\" opposed Britain's involvement in the Suez crisis in 1956, strongly criticising the government's handling of the debacle. The paper went on to oppose Macmillan's government's re-election in the 1959 United Kingdom general election, complaining: \"The continued Conservative pretence that Suez was a good, a noble, a wise venture has been too much to stomach\u00a0... the Government is taking its stand on a solid principle: 'Never admit a mistake.'\" The paper also says that it was influential in campaigning for the decriminalisation of homosexuality. It gave vocal support to the proposals of the Wolfenden Committee in 1957, condemning the \"utterly irrational and illogical\" old laws on homosexuality: \"Not only is the law unjust in conception, it is almost inevitably unjust in practice.\"\nIn March 1957, Jenny Nicholson, a frequent contributor, wrote a piece on the Italian Socialist Party congress in Venice, which mentioned three Labour Party politicians (Aneurin Bevan, Richard Crossman, and Morgan Phillips) \"who puzzled the Italians by filling themselves like tanks with whisky and coffee\". All three sued for libel, the case went to trial, and \"The Spectator\" was forced to make a large payment in damages and costs, a sum well over the equivalent of \u00a3150,000 today. It has since emerged that \"all three plaintiffs, to a greater or lesser degree, perjured themselves in court\".\nGilmour gave up the editorship in 1959, in part to abet his chance of selection as a Conservative MP. He appointed his deputy Brian Inglis, who introduced to the magazine a fresh spirit of political satire. In 1959\u2014much to the embarrassment of Gilmour (who remained the owner)\u2014\"The Spectator\" advised either voting for the Liberal Party or tactically abstaining. Despite a marked increase in sales, Gilmour felt that \"The Spectator\" was losing its political edge, so replaced him in 1962 with Iain Hamilton. Hamilton successfully balanced a keener focus on current affairs with some more raucous contributions as the young team behind \"Private Eye\" were commissioned to write a mock eight-page \"Child's Guide to Modern Culture\". Much to the shock of Hamilton and the \"Spectator\" staff, Gilmour replaced Hamilton in 1963 with Iain Macleod, the Conservative MP who had resigned from the cabinet on the controversial appointment of Sir Alec Douglas-Home to succeed Harold Macmillan as prime minister. A widely circulated letter, signed by \"Spectator\" journalists and board members, berated Gilmour for mistreating an admired editor and appointing an active politician who could jeopardise the independence of the magazine: \"We believe strongly that \"The Spectator\", with its long and honourable history of independent opinion, should not be tossed about at the whim of the proprietor or lose its independence by identification with a narrow political faction.\"\n\"The Tory Leadership\" article.\nTwo months into his post, in January 1964, Macleod intensified the shock by revealing the behind-the-scenes machinations of the Conservative party. In a long article entitled \"The Tory Leadership\", ostensibly a review of a new book (\"The Fight for the Tory Leadership\") by Randolph Churchill, Macleod laid out his version of events in great detail. In disclosing, from the horse's mouth, the mysterious circumstances of Douglas-Home's appointment, the article caused an immediate sensation. Churchill's book was all but obliterated by the review, which said that \"four fifths\" of it \"could have been compiled by anyone with a pair of scissors, a pot of paste and a built-in prejudice against Mr Butler and Sir William Haley\". That week's edition, bearing the headline \"Iain Macleod, What Happened\", sold a record number of copies.\nNigel Lawson, George Gale, and Harry Creighton.\nThe \"Tory Leadership\" article prompted a furious response from many \"Spectator\" readers and caused Macleod, for a time, to be shunned by political colleagues. He eventually regained his party's favour, however, and rejoined the shadow cabinet in the same year. On his appointment as Shadow Chancellor in 1965, he stepped down as editor on the last day of the year, to be replaced by Nigel Lawson. Sometimes called \"The Great Procrastinator\" because of his tendency to leave writing leaders until the last minute, Lawson had been City editor for \"The Sunday Telegraph\" and Alec Douglas-Home's personal assistant during the 1964 United Kingdom general election. In 1966, largely due to Lawson, \"The Spectator\" opposed America's increasing military commitment in Vietnam. In a signed article he estimated \"the risks involved in an American withdrawal from Vietnam are less than the risks in escalating a bloody and brutal war\".\nIn 1967, Ian Gilmour, who by then had joined parliament and was already finding the proprietorship a hindrance in political life, sold \"The Spectator\" to Harry Creighton for \u00a375,000 (). In 1970, Creighton replaced Lawson as editor with George Gale; there had been growing resentment between the two men. Gale shared Creighton's political outlook, in particular his strong opposition to the EEC, and much of the next five years was spent attacking the pro-EEC prime minister Edward Heath, treating his eventual defeat by Margaret Thatcher with undisguised delight. Gale's almost obsessive opposition to the EEC and antagonistic attitude towards Heath began to lose the magazine readers. In 1973 Creighton took over the editorship himself, but was, if possible, even less successful in stemming the losses. Circulation fell from 36,000 in 1966 to below 13,000. As one journalist who joined \"The Spectator\" at that time said: \"It gave the impression, an entirely accurate one, of a publication surviving on a shoestring\". George Gale later remarked that Creighton had only wanted the job to get into \"Who's Who\".\n1975\u20132005.\nHenry Keswick and Alexander Chancellor.\nIn 1975, Creighton sold \"The Spectator\" to Henry Keswick, again for \u00a375,000 (Creighton sold the 99 Gower Street premises separately, so the magazine moved to 56 Doughty Street). Keswick was chairman of the Jardine Matheson multinational corporation. He was drawn to the paper partly because he harboured political aspirations (the paper's perk as a useful stepping stone to Westminster was, by now, well established), but also because his father had been a friend of Peter Fleming, its well-known columnist (under the name \"Strix\"). Keswick gave the job of editor to \"the only journalist he knew\", Alexander Chancellor, an old family friend and his mother's godson, with whom he had been at Eton and Cambridge. Before then, Chancellor had worked at Reuters news agency and had been a scriptwriter and reporter for ITN. In spite of his relative inexperience, he was to become known as \"one of the best editors in the history of \"The Spectator\"\".\nChancellor's editorship of the paper relied principally on a return to earlier values. He adopted a new format and a more traditional weekly style, with the front page displaying five cover lines above the leader. Most significantly, he recognised the need \"to bring together a number of talented writers and, with the minimal of editorial interference, let them write\". To this end he persuaded Auberon Waugh (who had been sacked by Nigel Lawson) to return from the \"New Statesman\", and enticed Richard West and Jeffrey Bernard from the same magazine. Another columnist recruited by Chancellor was Taki Theodoracopulos whose column \"High Life\" was then printed beside Bernard's \"Low Life\". Taki's column, frequently criticised for its content by the press, remains in the paper. In September 1978, a 96-page issue was released to mark \"The Spectator\"'s 150th anniversary. William Rees-Mogg congratulated the paper in a \"Times\"'s leading article, praising it in particular for its important part in \"the movement away from collectivism\".\nCharles Moore.\nChancellor was replaced by the 27-year-old Charles Moore in February 1984, after the magazine's then owner Algy Cluff had become concerned that \"The Spectator\" was \"lacking in political weight\" and considered Chancellor to be \"commercially irresponsible\". Moore had been a leader writer at \"The Daily Telegraph\" before Chancellor recruited him to \"The Spectator\" as political commentator. Under Moore, the paper became more political than it had been under Chancellor. The new editor adopted an approach that was, in general, pro-Margaret Thatcher, while showing no restraint in opposing her on certain issues. The paper called the Anglo-Irish Agreement \"a fraudulent prospectus\" in 1985, came out against the Single European Act, and in 1989 criticised the handover of Hong Kong to China. Moore wrote that, if Britain failed to allow the city's UK passport holders right of abode in Britain, \"we shall have to confess that, for the first time in our history, we have forced Britons to be slaves.\" Moore also introduced several new contributors, including a restaurant column by Nigella Lawson (the former editor's daughter), and a humorous column by Craig Brown. When Taki was briefly imprisoned for cocaine possession Moore refused to accept his resignation, explaining publicly: \"We expect our High Life columnist to be high some of the time.\"\n\"The Spectator\" changed hands again in 1985, by which time it was facing financial meltdown, having an accumulated an overdraft of over \u00a3300,000. Cluff had reached the conclusion that the paper \"would be best secured in the hands of a publishing group\", and sold it to Australian company John Fairfax, which promptly paid off the overdraft. With the support of its new proprietor, the paper was able to widen its readership through subscription drives and advertising, reaching a circulation of 30,000 in 1986, exceeding the circulation of the \"New Statesman\" for the first time. The magazine was again sold in 1988, after an uncertain period during which several candidates, including Rupert Murdoch, attempted to buy the magazine. Moore wrote to Murdoch, saying: \"Most of our contributors and many of our readers would be horrified at the idea of your buying \"The Spectator\". They believe you are autocratic and that you have a bad effect on journalism of quality\u00a0\u2013 they cite \"The Times\" as the chief example.\"\nDominic Lawson and Frank Johnson.\nAs \"The Spectator\" was bought by the Telegraph Group, Moore resigned the editorship in 1990 to become deputy editor of \"The Daily Telegraph\". He was replaced by his own deputy editor, Dominic Lawson\u2014the former editor's son. Shortly after becoming editor, Lawson became responsible for the resignation of a cabinet minister when he interviewed the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Nicholas Ridley. During the interview, Ridley described the proposed Economic and Monetary Union as \"a German racket designed to take over the whole of Europe\", and seemed to draw comparisons between the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Adolf Hitler. The interview appeared in the issue of 14 July 1990, the cover of which showed a cartoon by Nicholas Garland that showed Ridley painting a crude comb-over and a Hitler moustache onto a poster of Kohl. Ridley resigned from Thatcher's government immediately.\n\"The Spectator\" caused controversy in 1994 when it printed an article entitled \"Kings of the Deal\" on a claimed Jewish influence in Hollywood, written by William Cash, who at the time was based in Los Angeles and working mainly for \"The Daily Telegraph\", which had considered the article too risky to publish. Lawson thought Cash's idea was as old as Hollywood itself and that Lawson's being Jewish would mitigate adverse reactions to publication. There was considerable controversy. Although owner Conrad Black did not personally rebuke Lawson, Max Hastings, then editor of \"The Daily Telegraph\", wrote with regard to Black, who also owned \"The Jerusalem Post\" at the time, \"It was one of the few moments in my time with Conrad when I saw him look seriously rattled: 'You don't understand, Max. My entire interests in the United States and internationally could be seriously damaged by this'.\"\nThe article was defended by some conservatives. John Derbyshire, who says he has \"complicated and sometimes self-contradictory feelings about Jews\", wrote on \"National Review Online\" regarding what he saw as the Jewish overreaction to the article that \"It was a display of arrogance, cruelty, ignorance, stupidity, and sheer bad manners by rich and powerful people towards a harmless, helpless young writer, and the Jews who whipped up this preposterous storm should all be thoroughly ashamed of themselves\". Lawson left in 1995 to become editor of \"The Sunday Telegraph\", and was replaced by a deputy editor of the same newspaper, Frank Johnson. After the 1997 United Kingdom general election, Johnson averted a decline in \"The Spectator\"'s sales by recruiting \"New Labour contributors\", and shifting the magazine's direction slightly away from politics. In 1996, the magazine's Christmas issue featured an interview with the Spice Girls, in which the band members gave their \"Euro-sceptic and generally anti-Labour\" views on politics. Shortly before her death Diana, Princess of Wales, was depicted on the magazine's cover as the figurehead of Mohamed Al-Fayed's boat, The Jonikal.\nBoris Johnson.\nBefore joining \"The Spectator\" as editor, Boris Johnson had worked for \"The Times\", the Wolverhampton \"Express &amp; Star\", and \"The Daily Telegraph\". He had also briefly been political commentator for \"The Spectator\" under Dominic Lawson, but Frank Johnson replaced him with Bruce Anderson in 1995. Succeeding Frank Johnson in 1999, Johnson increased \"Spectator\" subscriptions to a record 70,000 per year, and has been described as a \"colourful editor\". In the 2001 United Kingdom general election, Johnson was elected MP for Henley, and by 2004 had been made vice-chairman of the Conservative party, with a place in Michael Howard's shadow cabinet. In 2003, he explained his editorial policy for \"The Spectator\" would \"always be roughly speaking in favour of getting rid of Saddam, sticking up for Israel, free-market economics, expanding choice\" and that the magazine was \"not necessarily a Thatcherite Conservative or a neo-conservative magazine, even though in our editorial coverage we tend to follow roughly the conclusions of those lines of arguments.\" In February 2003, Johnson was the subject of a Scotland Yard inquiry relating to a column by Taki Theodoracopulos titled \"Thoughts on Thuggery\" targeting barrister Peter Herbert, a black man. Following the column's publication, Herbert had received over 40 racist emails, mostly from the United States, some of which contained death threats. Johnson called the column \"a terrible thing\" which \"should never have gone in.\"\nIn October 2004, a \"Spectator\" editorial suggested that the death of the hostage Kenneth Bigley was being over-sentimentalised by the people of Liverpool, accusing them of indulging in a \"vicarious victimhood\" and of possessing a \"deeply unattractive psyche\". Simon Heffer had written the leader but, as editor, Johnson took full responsibility for it. Michael Howard subsequently ordered him to visit Liverpool on a \"penitential pilgrimage\". At this time, the paper began jokingly to be referred to as the 'Sextator', owing to the number of sex scandals connected with the magazine during his editorship. These included an affair between columnist Rod Liddle and the magazine's receptionist, and Johnson's own affair with another columnist, Petronella Wyatt. Johnson at first denied the relationship, dismissing the allegations as \"an inverted pyramid of piffle\", but was sacked from the Shadow Cabinet in November 2004 when they turned out to be true. In the same year David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, resigned from the government after it emerged he had been having an affair with the publisher of \"The Spectator\", Kimberly Quinn, and had fast-tracked her nanny's visa application.\nIn 2005, circulation was as high as 60,000 by the time Johnson left to be the Shadow Minister for Higher Education. On the announcement of his departure, Andrew Neil, chairman of \"The Spectator\" paid tribute to his editorship; however, Neil later rebuked Johnson for having delegated most of his responsibilities to an assistant, in a Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" episode titled \"Boris Johnson: Has He Run Out of Road?\" During Johnson's editorship, Mary Wakefield began working at the magazine: she is now the magazine's commissioning editor and is married to Johnson's former political advisor Dominic Cummings.\nIn 2004, the Barclay Brothers purchased the Telegraph Group from Hollinger International, which included \"The Spectator\" within its titles.\n2006\u2013present.\nMatthew d'Ancona.\nD'Ancona had been Deputy Editor at \"The Sunday Telegraph\", and before that an assistant editor at \"The Times\". During his four years as editor of \"The Spectator\", he made several editorial and structural changes to the magazine, \"not all of which were universally popular with readers\". He ended the traditional summary of the week's events, \"Portrait of the Week\", and in 2006 launched a new lifestyle section entitled \"You Earned It\". He removed Peter Oborne as political editor, and appointed Fraser Nelson in his place. He decided not to appoint a new media columnist to succeed Stephen Glover, explaining, \"I do not think \"The Spectator\" needs a media columnist. Our pages are precious and I do not think the internal wranglings of our trade are high on the list of \"Spectator\" readers' priorities.\"\nPerhaps the magazine's most important innovation under d'Ancona was the Coffee House blog, led by Peter Hoskin and James Forsyth, launched in May 2007. In 2007, \"The Spectator\" moved its offices from Doughty Street, which had been its home for 32 years, to 22 Old Queen Street in Westminster. \"The Spectator Australia\" was launched in October 2008. Apparently printed in Australia at the same time as, and with almost all the content of, the parent edition it finds its own cover illustrations and its first dozen pages are Australian. Circulation reached a weekly average of 10,389 in January to December 2020.\nFraser Nelson.\nIn August 2009, Fraser Nelson replaced d'Ancona as editor of \"The Spectator\". In 2010, he unveiled a slight redesign of the paper, shrinking the cover illustration slightly, shifting the cover lines, in general, to the bottom, and spreading the contents section over a double-page. Playing down the changes, Nelson described the new look as \"a tidy-up\u00a0... rather like restoring an old painting.\"\nAn article in November 2011 by Rod Liddle on the trial of two men eventually convicted for the murder of Stephen Lawrence led to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) deciding to prosecute the magazine for breaching reporting restrictions. The magazine chose not to contest the case, and the publisher Spectator 1828 Ltd pleaded guilty at the court hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court on 7 June 2012. The magazine was fined \u00a33,000, with \u00a32,000 compensation awarded to Stephen Lawrence's parents and \u00a3625 costs. According to Nelson, readers' most common reaction to the columnist was \"don't tone down Rod\", but \"our non-readers don't like\" him. In June 2013, The Spectator Archive was launched, containing 1.5 million pages from 180 years of published articles. In July 2013, the magazine ran a column by Taki Theodoracopulos defending the far-right Greek political party Golden Dawn, which drew criticism. In May 2018, Theodoracopulos published a column defending the Wehrmacht.\nIn August 2015, \"The Spectator\" received media attention and criticism after publishing an article by Charles Moore regarding the 2015 Labour Party leadership election titled \"Have Yvette Cooper and Liz Kendall got the looks for a leadership contest?\", in which he wrote \"there is an understanding that no leader \u2013 especially, despite the age of equality, a woman \u2013 can look grotesque on television and win a general election\" and discussed the looks of the two female candidates in detail. The article was condemned by Liz Kendall; the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon; and the candidate for Labour nomination for Mayor of London and former Minister and MP Tessa Jowell along with several journalists and MPs from various parties.\nIn 2018, Nelson and deputy editor Freddy Gray launched a digital-only version of \"The Spectator USA\". The monthly print magazine \"The Spectator US Edition\", alongside the website spectator.us, was launched with the Inaugural Edition in October 2019 and the publication surpassed 10,000 subscribers in 2020. For the October 2020 issue, the title was changed to \"The Spectator Est. 1828\", with the website remaining the same. For the June 2021 issue, the website changed to spectatorworld.com as the name changed again to \"The Spectator World\".\nIn June 2023, it was reported that, following a breakdown in discussions relating to a financial dispute, Lloyds Bank was planning to take over control of the companies owning the \"Daily Telegraph\" and \"Spectator\" titles and sell them off. Representatives of the Barclay family have described the reports as \"irresponsible\". That same month, Telegraph Media Group Limited (TMG) was put up for sale, after its parent company B.UK, a Bermuda-based holding company, went into receivership. Howard and Aidan Barclay were removed as directors. When a company linked to the United Arab Emirates attempted to buy TMG, chairman Andrew Neil threatened to quit, saying: \"You cannot have a major mainstream newspaper group owned by an undemocratic government or dictatorship where no one has a vote.\" Fraser Nelson, editor of \"The Spectator\", also opposed the move, saying \"the very reason why a foreign government would want to buy a sensitive asset is the very reason why a national government should be wary of selling them.\"\n2024 acquisition by Paul Marshall.\nOn 10 September 2024, \"The Spectator\" was purchased for \u00a3100 million by Paul Marshall, hedge fund manager and co-owner of GB News. The final price came after a bidding war against Rupert Murdoch, and was more than double the \u00a340m valuation given by media analysts.\n\"Spectator\" chairman Andrew Neil, who clashed with Marshall during his brief tenure at GB News, announced his resignation with immediate effect one hour after the deal was completed. He warned Marshall over editorial independence, telling \"Spectator\" staff: \"My greatest regret is that I have not been able to find you a new home guaranteed to nurture the unique chemistry of \"The Spectator\".\u2009[...]\u2009I cannot tell if the new owners will have the same reverence for editorial independence since they have not shared their thinking.\" Neil had previously opposed Marshall's bid, saying that hedge fund managers should not own newspapers due to potential conflicts of interest.\nThe Spectator was sold by Redbird IMI, whose CEO Jeff Zucker had previously called Marshall \"unfit to own a newspaper\", due to his sharing of far-right content on Twitter, when Marshall and RedBird were battling to take control of \"The Telegraph\". A Conservative MP told the \"Financial Times\" that Marshall's agenda \"was one of destroying the Conservative party and having a new form of Trumpism in the UK\", referencing populist GB News coverage. Another Conservative MP, on the right of the party, welcomed Marshall's proprietorship, describing Marshall as \"thoughtful and interested in ideas, not tribally Conservative but committed to the best traditions of liberal democracy\". The acquisition included \"The Spectator's\" sister title \"Apollo\" and added both titles to Marshall's OQS Media group, to be jointly published with UnHerd. OQS chief executive Freddie Sayers indicated an intent to expand in North America.\nOn 25 September 2024, former Conservative MP Michael Gove was appointed as editor of \"The Spectator\", replacing Fraser Nelson, who became associate editor, with Charles Moore becoming non-executive chair to replace Andrew Neil. Gove is considered a long-standing ally of Paul Marshall. The \"New Statesman\" reported that \"Spectator\" staff were shocked at Nelson being replaced, after Nelson had written an article praising Marshall when the acquisition was announced. One week earlier, Nelson had told the British Society of Magazine Editors that editors should \"actively ignore\" suggestions from owners, adding: \"If you get sacked for it, you get sacked for it \u2013 but you hold the line. Famous last words.\" Regarding Marshall, he said: \"I should be having no contact with him. In the same way I had no contact with the Barclays when they owned \"The Spectator\".\"\nPolitical ideology and policy positions.\n\"The Spectator\" is politically conservative. Historically, the magazine was liberal in outlook, and over the course of its first century supported the Radical wing of the Whigs, the Liberal Party, and the Liberal Unionists, who eventually merged with the Conservatives. In 1957, the magazine was nicknamed \"the Bugger's Bugle\" by \"The Sunday Express\" following a sustained campaign by \"The Spectator\" to decriminalise homosexuality. It was the only national publication to endorse Margaret Thatcher for leadership of the Conservative Party in the 1975 leadership election.\nParticularly since the 7 July 2005 Islamic terrorist attacks on the London Underground, \"The Spectator\" has been critical of multiculturalism, arguing that it undermines Britain's national identity and endangers its security through sectarianism and growing Islamic extremism.\nAs with its sister publication \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"The Spectator\" is generally Atlanticist and strongly Eurosceptic in outlook, favouring close ties with the United States and NATO rather than with the European Union. The magazine is a strong supporter of Israel. Some of its articles have opposed the creation of a Palestinian state, with one article arguing that a Palestinian state would be a \"Trojan Horse\" to destroy Israel. It has also supported Ukraine following its invasion by Russia in 2022.\nAhead of the 2019 United Kingdom general election, the leading article in the magazine argued that illegal migrants living in the UK should be offered British citizenship. \"The Spectator\" has been one of the most outspoken supporters of Brexit. The magazine campaigned against Britain joining the European Common Market in the 1975 referendum, and was one of only two national titles (alongside the \"Morning Star\") to back a \"Leave\" vote in the 2016 United Kingdom referendum, though it also provided a platform for \"Remain\" campaigners to argue for their side in the magazine and hosted a number of debates.\nCultural influence.\nThe magazine has popularised or coined the phrases \"The Establishment\" (1955), \"nanny state\" (1965), \"young fogey\" (1984), and \"virtue signalling\" (2015).\nThe Shiva Naipaul Memorial Prize for outstanding travel writing offers \u00a32,000 every year.&lt;ref name=\"spectator/Tan/prize-open\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first winner was Hilary Mantel in 1987.&lt;ref name=\"spectator/hamra-prize\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"spectator/tag/prize\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nContributors.\nIn addition to the permanent staff of writers, other contributors included:\nEditors.\nThe editors of \"The Spectator\" have been:\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "64054", "revid": "47547606", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64054", "title": "Henley-on-Thames", "text": "Town in Oxfordshire, England\nHenley-on-Thames ( ) is a town and civil parish on the River Thames, in the South Oxfordshire district, in Oxfordshire, England, northeast of Reading, west of Maidenhead, southeast of Oxford and west of London (by road), near the tripoint of Oxfordshire, Berkshire and Buckinghamshire. The population at the 2021 census was 12,186.\nHistory.\nThe name Henley derives from the Old English \"h\u0113ahl\u0113ah\" meaning 'high wood or clearing'.\nThere is archaeological evidence of people residing in Henley since the second century as part of the Romano-British period. Henley does not appear in Domesday Book of 1086; often it is mistaken for \"Henlei\" in the book which is in Surrey. The first record of Henley as a substantial settlement is from 1179, when it is recorded that King Henry II \"had bought land for the making of buildings\". King John granted the manor of Benson and the town and manor of Henley to Robert Harcourt in 1199. A church at Henley is first mentioned in 1204. In 1205 the town received a tax for street paving, and in 1234 the bridge is first mentioned. In 1278 Henley is described as a hamlet of Benson with a chapel. The street plan was probably established by the end of the 13th century. As a demesne of the crown it was granted in 1337 to John de Molyns, whose family held it for about 250 years.\nThe existing Thursday market, it is believed, was granted by a charter of King John. A market was certainly in existence by 1269; however, the jurors of the assize of 1284 said that they did not know by what warrant the Earl of Cornwall held a market and fair in the town of Henley. The existing Corpus Christi fair was granted by a charter of Henry VI. During the Black Death pandemic that swept through England in the 14th century, Henley lost 60% of its population. A variation on its name can be seen as \"Henley up a Tamys\" in 1485. \nBy the beginning of the 16th century, the town extended along the west bank of the Thames from Friday Street in the south to the Manor, now Phyllis Court, in the north and took in Hart Street and New Street. To the west, it included Bell Street and the Market Place.\nHenley suffered at the hands of both parties in the Civil War. Later, William III rested here on his march to London in 1688, at the nearby recently rebuilt Fawley Court, and received a deputation from the Lords. The town's period of prosperity in the 17th and 18th centuries was due to manufactures of glass and malt, and trade in corn and wool. Henley-on-Thames supplied London with timber and grain. A workhouse to accommodate 150 people was built at West Hill in Henley in 1790, and was later enlarged to accommodate 250 as the Henley Poor Law Union workhouse.\nGovernance.\nThere are three tiers of local government covering Henley, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Henley-on-Thames Town Council, South Oxfordshire District Council, and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council is based at Henley Town Hall in the Market Place.\nAdministrative history.\nHenley-on-Thames was an ancient parish. The town was also an ancient borough from the middle ages. Its date of becoming a borough is not known; it appears to have been a seigneurial borough under the control of the lord of the manor, who allowed the town's merchant guild to effectively run the town. The town's first municipal charter was granted in 1568 by Elizabeth I.\nThe borough was left unreformed when most boroughs across the country were standardised under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. Government commissioners had concluded that Henley's corporation had too few functions and the town was too small to justify the cost of reform. The old borough corporation continued to exist, but did not qualify for any subsequent new local government powers. In order to provide more modern forms of local government, notably including the provision of sewers, a separate local government district with an elected local board had to be set up in 1864. The local board then operated alongside the unreformed borough corporation until 1883, when the borough was eventually reformed to become a municipal borough. The reformed borough corporation (also known as the town council) took on the abolished local board's functions.\nThe borough of Henley-on-Thames was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new South Oxfordshire District Council. A successor parish called Henley-on-Thames was created covering the area of the abolished borough, with its parish council taking the name Henley-on-Thames Town Council.\nLandmarks and structures.\nHenley Bridge is a five arched bridge across the river built in 1786. It is a Grade I listed historic structure. During 2011 the bridge underwent a \u00a3200,000 repair programme after being hit by the boat \"Crazy Love\" in August 2010. About upstream of the bridge is Marsh Lock. Henley Town Hall, which occupies a prominent position in the Market Place, was designed by Henry Hare and completed in 1900. Chantry House is the second Grade I listed building in the town. It is unusual in having more storeys on one side than on the other. The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is nearby and has a 16th-century tower. The Old Bell is a pub in the centre of Henley on Bell Street. The building has been dated from 1325: the oldest-dated building in the town. To celebrate Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, 60 oak trees were planted in the shape of a Victoria Cross near Fairmile, the long straight road to the northwest of the town. Two notable buildings just outside Henley, in Buckinghamshire, are:\nTransport.\nThe town's railway station is the terminus of the Henley Branch Line from Twyford. In the past, there have been direct services to London Paddington. There are express mainline rail services from Reading () to Paddington. Trains from High Wycombe () go to London Marylebone. The M4 motorway (junction 8/9) and the M40 motorway (junction 4) are both about () away. \nBus route 850 is operated by Carousel Buses on a 15 minute frequency between High Wycombe, Marlow and Henley, extending every 30 minutes to Reading via Wargrave and Twyford.\nNotable businesses.\nMajor investment management company Invesco Perpetual is headquartered in Henley.\nEngineering company Stuart Turner manufactures domestic pumps in their town-centre factory.\nWatchmaker Bremont is based in the town and assembles their watches in their factory on the edge of town.\nOrganic baby food manufacturer Ella's Kitchen is headquartered in Henley-on-Thames.\nRowing.\nHenley is a world-renowned centre for rowing. Each summer the Henley Royal Regatta is held on Henley Reach, a naturally straight stretch of the river just north of the town. It was extended artificially. The event became \"Royal\" in 1851, when Prince Albert became patron of the regatta. Other regattas and rowing races are held on the same reach, including Henley Women's Regatta, Henley Town and Visitors Regatta, Henley Veteran Regatta, Upper Thames Small Boats Head, Henley Fours and Eights Head, and Henley Sculls. These \"Heads\" often attract strong crews that have won medals at national championships. Local rowing clubs include:\nThe regatta depicted in \"Dead in the Water\", an episode of the British detective television series Midsomer Murders, was filmed at Henley.\nRiver and Rowing Museum.\nThe River and Rowing Museum, located in Mill Meadows, was the town's only museum, until it closed in 2025. It was established in 1998, and officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The museum, designed by the architect David Chipperfield, featured information on the River Thames, the sport of rowing, and the town of Henley itself.

The Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict emerged from intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine between Palestinian Jews and Arabs, often described as the background to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. The conflict in its modern phase evolved since the declaration of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948, and consequent intervention of Arab armies on behalf of the Palestinian Arabs.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nIsrael gained independence on May 14, 1948, while a Palestinian attempt to establish a state in the Gaza Strip in September 1948 under an Egyptian protectorate failed, being de facto managed by Egyptian military and announced dissolved in 1959.\n1948\u20131966.\nBetween 1949 and 1953, there were 99 complaints made by Israel about the infiltration of armed groups or individuals and 30 complaints of armed Jordanian units crossing into Israeli territory. Several hundred Israeli civilians were killed by infiltrators, and some were raped and mutilated. Israel launched numerous reprisal raids in response. Between 1949 and 1956, 286 Israeli civilians were killed. During the same period, excluding the Suez War, 258 Israeli soldiers were killed. Between 2,700 and 5,000 Arab infiltrators were killed. It is unclear whether these Arabs were really infiltrators or were simply unauthorized crossers, as many Palestinians were crossing into Israel for economic reasons. The Israeli forces necessarily treated anyone attempting unauthorized entry as a potential infiltrator, given the level of bloodshed.\n1987\u20131991: First Intifada.\nThe First Intifada began with violence, riots, general strikes, and civil disobedience campaigns by Palestinians spread across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israeli forces responded with tear gas, plastic bullets, and live ammunition against the demonstrators.\nAfter the outbreak of the First Intifada, Shaikh Ahmed Yassin created Hamas from the Gaza wing of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Until that point the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza had enjoyed the support of the Israeli authorities and had refrained from violent attacks. However, Hamas quickly began attacks on Israeli military targets, and subsequently, Israeli civilians.\nThe Israeli army killed more than 1,000 Palestinians in the First Intifada whilst 164 Israelis were killed. Allegedly almost half (1,000) of the total Palestinian casualties were caused by internal fighting among Palestinian factions.\n2005\u2013present: Post-Intifada, Gaza conflict.\nAfter Israel completely withdrew from Gaza in 2005, Hamas and other militants unleashed a barrage of daily rocket attacks into Israel. The city of Sderot, for example, one mile away from Gaza, was hit by over 360 Qassam rockets within a six-month period after Israel's withdrawal. In June 2006, militants from Gaza tunneled into Israel, killing two soldiers and capturing one. Two weeks later, Hezbollah, supported by Iran and Syria, attacked Israel across the internationally recognized Israeli\u2013Lebanese border, killing eight soldiers and kidnapping two, simultaneously launching a barrage of rockets against civilian towns in northern Israel. Israel responded with a military operation that lasted 34 days. After Hamas fired thousands of rockets at Israeli communities and refused to renew a six-month truce, Israel responded with a military operation against Hamas to protect Israeli citizens. The 22-day operation ended on January 18, 2009. In May 2010, Turkish activists with the Free Gaza flotilla tried to break Israel's naval blockade of Hamas-controlled Gaza. In August 2010, Lebanese soldiers shot and killed an Israeli soldier during routine IDF maintenance on the border. Three Lebanese soldiers and one Lebanese journalist were killed in the exchange of gunfire.\n2023\u2013present.\nIn 2023, heavy warfare between Palestinians (dominated by Hamas) and Israel again erupted, more deadly and destructive than ever since the 1973 Yom Kippur War.\nDeath timelines.\nData is from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of the more than one and a half million properties on the National Register, 95,000 are listed individually. The remainder are contributing resources within historic districts.\nFor most of its history, the National Register has been administered by the National Park Service (NPS), an agency within the United States Department of the Interior. Its goals are to help property owners and interest groups, such as the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and coordinate, identify and protect historic sites in the United States. While National Register listings are mostly symbolic, their recognition of significance provides some financial incentive to owners of listed properties. Protection of the property is not guaranteed. During the nomination process, the property is evaluated in terms of the four criteria for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The application of those criteria has been the subject of criticism by academics of history and preservation, as well as the public and politicians. A property listed in the National Register, or located within a National Register Historic District, may qualify for tax incentives derived from the total value of expenses incurred in preserving the property.\nProperties can be nominated in a variety of forms, including individual properties, historic districts and multiple property submissions (MPS). The Register categorizes general listings into one of five types of properties: district, site, structure, building or object.\nNational Register Historic Districts are defined geographical areas consisting of contributing and non-contributing properties. Some properties are added automatically to the National Register when they become administered by the National Park Service. These include National Historic Landmarks (NHL), National Historic Landmark Districts (NHLD), National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks, national memorials, and some national monuments.\nHistory.\nOn October 15, 1966, the Historic Preservation Act created the National Register of Historic Places and the corresponding State Historic Preservation Offices (SHPO). The National Register initially consisted of the National Historic Landmarks designated before the Register's creation, as well as any other historic sites in the National Park System. Approval of the act, which was amended in 1980 and 1992, represented the first time the United States had a broad-based historic preservation policy. The 1966 act required those agencies to work in conjunction with the SHPO and an independent federal agency, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP), to confront adverse effects of federal activities on historic preservation.\nTo administer the newly created National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B. Hartzog Jr., established an administrative division named the Federal Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP). Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director. Within OAHP new divisions were created to deal with the National Register. The division administered several existing programs, including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund.\nThe first official Keeper of the Register was William J. Murtagh, an architectural historian. During the Register's earliest years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, organization was lax and SHPOs were small, understaffed and underfunded. However, funds were still being supplied for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide matching grants-in-aid to listed property owners, first for house museums and institutional buildings, but later for commercial structures as well.\nIn 1979, the NPS history programs affiliated with both the U.S. National Park system and the National Register were categorized formally into two \"Assistant Directorates\". Established were the Assistant Directorate for Archeology and Historic Preservation and the Assistant Directorate for Park Historic Preservation. From 1978 until 1981, the main agency for the National Register was the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service (HCRS) of the United States Department of the Interior.\nIn February 1983, the two assistant directorates were merged to promote efficiency and recognize the interdependency of their programs. Jerry L. Rogers was selected to direct this newly merged associate directorate. He was described as a skilled administrator, who was sensitive to the need for the NPS to work with SHPOs, academia and local governments.\nAlthough not described in detail in the 1966 act, SHPOs eventually became integral to the process of listing properties on the National Register. The 1980 amendments of the 1966 law further defined the responsibilities of SHPOs concerning the National Register. Several 1992 amendments of the NHPA added a category to the National Register, known as Traditional Cultural Properties: those properties associated with Native American or Hawaiian groups.\nThe National Register of Historic Places has grown considerably from its legislative origins in 1966. In 1986, citizens and groups nominated 3,623 separate properties, sites and districts for inclusion on the National Register, a total of 75,000 separate properties. Of the more than one and a half million properties on the National Register, 95,000 are listed individually. Others are listed as contributing members within historic districts.\nNomination process.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \" Any individual can prepare a National Register nomination, although historians and historic preservation consultants often are employed for this work. The nomination consists of a standard registration form (NPS 10-900) and contains basic information about a property's physical appearance and the type of significance embodied in the building, structure, object, site, or district.\nThe State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) receives National Register nominations and provides feedback to the nominating individual or group. After preliminary review, the SHPO sends each nomination to the state's historic review commission, which then recommends whether the State Historic Preservation Officer should send the nomination to the Keeper of the National Register. For any non-Federally owned property, only the State Historic Preservation Officer may officially nominate a property for inclusion in the National Register. After the nomination is recommended for listing in the National Register by the SHPO, the nomination is sent to the National Park Service, which approves or denies the nomination.\nIf approved, the property is entered officially by the Keeper of the National Register into the National Register of Historic Places. Property owners are notified of the nomination during the review by the SHPO and state's historic review commission. If an owner objects to a nomination of private property, or in the case of a historic district, a majority of owners, then the property cannot be listed in the National Register of Historic Places.\nCriteria.\nFor a property to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, it must meet at least one of its four main criteria. Information about architectural styles, association with various aspects of social history and commerce and ownership are all integral parts of the nomination. Each nomination contains a narrative section that provides a detailed physical description of the property and justifies why it is significant historically with regard either to local, state, or national history. The four National Register of Historic Places criteria are the following:\nThe criteria are applied differently for different types of properties; for instance, maritime properties have application guidelines different from those of buildings.\nExclusions.\nThe National Park Service names seven categories of properties that \"are not usually considered for\" and \"ordinarily ... shall not be considered eligible for\" the National Register: religious properties (e.g., churches); buildings that have been moved; birthplaces or graves of important persons; cemeteries; reconstructed properties; commemorative properties (e.g., statues); and \"properties that have achieved significance within the last fifty years\".25 However, if they meet particular \"Criteria Considerations\" for their category in addition to the overall criteria, they are, in fact, eligible.25 Hence, despite the forbidding language, these kinds of places are not actually excluded as a rule. For example, the Register lists thousands of churches.\nThere is a misconception that there is a strict rule that a property must be at least 50 years old to be listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In reality, there is no hard rule. John H. Sprinkle Jr., deputy director of the Federal Preservation Institute, stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[T]his \"rule\" is only an exception to the criteria that shape listings within the National Register of Historic Places. Of the eight \"exceptions\" [or criteria considerations], Consideration G, for properties that have achieved significance within the past fifty years, is probably the best-known, yet also misunderstood preservation principle in America.\nThe National Register evaluation procedures do not use the term \"exclusions\". The stricter National Historic Landmarks Criteria, upon which the National Register criteria are based, do specify exclusions, along with corresponding \"exceptions to the exclusions\", which are supposed to apply more narrowly.52\nMultiple property submission.\nA multiple property submission (MPS) is a thematic group listing of the National Register of Historic Places that consists of related properties that share a common theme and can be submitted as a group. Multiple property submissions must satisfy certain basic criteria for the group of properties to be included in the National Register.\nThe process begins with the multiple property documentation form which acts as a cover document rather than the nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The purpose of the documentation form is to establish the basis of eligibility for related properties. The information of the multiple property documentation form can be used to nominate and register related historic properties simultaneously, or to establish criteria for properties that may be nominated in the future. Thus, additions to an MPS can occur over time.\nThe nomination of individual properties in an MPS is accomplished in the same manner as other nominations. The name of the \"thematic group\" denotes the historical theme of the properties. It is considered the \"multiple property listing\". Once an individual property or a group of properties is nominated and listed in the National Register, the multiple property documentation form, combined with the individual National Register of Historic Places nomination forms, constitute a multiple property submission.\nExamples of MPS include the Lee County Multiple Property Submission, the Warehouses in Omaha, the Boundary Markers of the Original District of Columbia and the Illinois Carnegie Libraries. Before the term \"Multiple Property Submission\" was introduced in 1984, such listings were known as \"Thematic Resources\", such as the Operating Passenger Railroad Stations Thematic Resource, or \"Multiple Resource Areas\".\nProperties listed.\nA listing on the National Register of Historic Places is a governmental acknowledgment of a historic district, site, building, or property. However, the Register is mostly \"an honorary status with some federal financial incentives\". The National Register of Historic Places automatically includes all National Historic Landmarks as well as all historic areas administered by the National Park Service, including National Historic Sites (NHS), National Historical Parks, National Military Parks/Battlefields, National Memorials and some National Monuments. \nThere are also 35 listed sites in the three island countries with a Compact of Free Association with the United States, as well as one site in Morocco, the American Legation in Tangier.\nListing in the National Register does not restrict private property owners from the use of their property.\nSome states and municipalities, however, may have laws that become effective when a property is listed in the National Register. If federal money or a federal permitting process is involved, Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 is invoked. Section 106 requires the federal agency involved to assess the effect of its actions on historic resources. A salient example of a successful 106 Review was the early 1970's review of the Department of Transportation's proposal to tunnel under Baltimore's historic Federal Hill neighborhood with a 14 lane highway, the 106 Review, and the highway's ultimate rerouting and reduction in size -- as well as provision of a buffer park, what became Baltimore's Robert Baker Park.\nStatutorily, the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) has the most significant role by Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The section requires that the director of any federal agency with direct or indirect jurisdiction of a project that may affect a property listed or determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places must first report to the Advisory Council. The director of said agency is required to \"take into account the effect of the undertaking\" on the National Register property, as well as to afford the ACHP a reasonable opportunity to comment.\nWhile Section 106 does not mandate explicitly that any federal agency director accept the advice of the ACHP, their advice has a practical influence, especially given the statutory obligations of the NHPA that require federal agencies to \"take into account the effect of the undertaking\".\nIn cases where the ACHP determines federal action will have an \"adverse effect\" on historic properties, mitigation is sought. Typically, a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) is created by which the involved parties agree to a particular plan. Many states have laws similar to Section 106. In contrast to conditions relating to a federally designated historic district, municipal ordinances governing local historic districts often restrict certain kinds of changes to properties. Thus, they may protect the property more than a National Register listing does.\nThe Department of Transportation Act, passed on October 15, 1966, the same day as the National Historic Preservation Act, included provisions that addressed historic preservation. The DOT Act is much more general than Section 106 NHPA in that it refers to properties other than those listed in the Register.\nThe more general language has allowed more properties and parklands to enjoy status as protected areas by this legislation, a policy developed early in its history. The United States Supreme Court ruled in the 1971 case \"Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe\" that parklands could have the same protected status as \"historic sites\".\nTypes of properties.\nListed properties are generally in one of five broad categories, although there are special considerations for other types of properties that in anyone, or into more specialized subcategories. The five general categories for National Register properties are: building, structure, site, district and object. In addition, historic districts consist of contributing and non-contributing properties.\nBuildings, as defined by the National Register, are distinguished in the traditional sense. Examples include a house, barn, hotel, church, or similar construction. They are created primarily to shelter human activity. The term building, as in outbuilding, can be used to refer to historically and functionally related units, such as a courthouse and a jail or a barn and a house.\nStructures differ from buildings in that they are functional constructions meant to be used for purposes other than sheltering human activity. Examples include an aircraft, a grain elevator, a gazebo and a bridge.\nObjects are usually artistic in nature, or small in scale compared to structures and buildings. Although objects may be movable, they are generally associated with a specific setting or environment. Examples of objects include monuments, sculptures and fountains.\nSites are the locations of significant events, which can be prehistoric or historic in nature and represent activities or buildings (standing, ruined, or vanished). When sites are listed, it is the locations themselves that are of historical interest. They possess cultural or archaeological value regardless of the value of any structures that currently exist at the locations. Examples of types of sites include shipwrecks, battlefields, campsites, natural features and rock shelters.\nHistoric districts possess a concentration, association, or continuity of the other four types of properties. Objects, structures, buildings and sites in a historic district are united historically or aesthetically, either by choice or by the nature of their development.\nThere are several other different types of historic preservation associated with the properties of the National Register of Historic Places that cannot be classified as either simple buildings or historic districts. Through the National Park Service, the National Register of Historic Places publishes a series of bulletins designed to aid in evaluating and applying the criteria for evaluation of different types of properties. Although the criteria are always the same, the manner they are applied may differ slightly, depending upon the type of property involved. The National Register bulletins describe the application of the criteria for aids to navigation, historic battlefields, archaeological sites, aviation properties, cemeteries and burial places, historic designed landscapes, mining sites, post offices, properties associated with significant persons, properties achieving significance within the last fifty years, rural historic landscapes, traditional cultural properties and vessels and shipwrecks.\nProperty owner incentives.\nProperties are not protected in any strict sense by the Federal listing. States and local zoning bodies may or may not choose to protect listed historic places. Indirect protection is possible, by state and local regulations on the development of National Register properties and by tax incentives. By contrast, the state of Colorado, for example, does not set any limits on owners of National Register properties.\nUntil 1976, federal tax incentives were virtually non-existent for buildings on the National Register. Before 1976 the federal tax code favored new construction rather than the reuse of existing, sometimes historical, structures. In 1976, the tax code was altered to provide tax incentives that promote the preservation of income-producing historic properties. The National Park Service was given the responsibility to ensure that only rehabilitations that preserved the historic character of a building would qualify for federal tax incentives. A qualifying rehabilitation is one that the NPS deems consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. Properties and sites listed in the Register, as well as those located in and contributing to the period of significance of National Register Historic Districts, became eligible for the federal tax benefits.\nOwners of income-producing properties listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places or of properties that are contributing resources within a National Register Historic District may be eligible for a 20% investment tax credit for the rehabilitation of the historic structure. The rehabilitation may be of a commercial, industrial, or residential property, for rentals. The tax incentives program is operated by the Federal Historic Preservation Tax Incentives program, which is managed jointly by the National Park Service, individual State Historic Preservation Offices and the Internal Revenue Service.\nSome property owners may also qualify for grants, like the now-defunct Save America's Treasures grants, which apply specifically to properties entered in the Register with national significance or designated as National Historic Landmarks.\nThe NHPA did not distinguish between properties listed in the National Register of Historic Places and those designated as National Historic Landmarks concerning qualification for tax incentives or grants. This was deliberate, as the authors of the act had learned from experience that distinguishing between categories of significance for such incentives caused the lowest category to become expendable. Essentially, this made the Landmarks a kind of \"honor roll\" of the most significant properties of the National Register of Historic Places.\nLimitations.\n 982 properties have been removed from the Register, most often due to being destroyed. Among the properties that were demolished or otherwise destroyed after their listing are the Jobbers Canyon Historic District in Omaha, Nebraska (listed in 1979, demolished in 1989), Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, California (listed in 1978, destroyed in a fire in 1989), Palace Amusements in Asbury Park, New Jersey (listed in 2000, demolished in 2004), The Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas (listed in 1997, destroyed by Hurricane Ike in 2008), seven of the nine buildings included in the University of Connecticut Historic District in Storrs, Connecticut (listed in 1989, demolished in 2017), and the Terrell Jacobs Circus Winter Quarters in Peru, Indiana (listed in 2012, demolished in 2021).\nComparisons to historic registers of other nations.\nIn France, designation of is similar to NRHP listing. In the French program, however, permanent restrictions are imposed upon designated monuments, for example requiring advance approval for any renovation of a designated building. France had about 43,600 monuments in 2015.\nListed buildings of the United Kingdom may not be demolished, extended, or altered without special permission; the program covers about 374,000 listings in 2010, involving more than 500,000 buildings.\nNRHP listing, in contrast, imposes no such restrictions, but rather is \"primarily an honor\", although tax subsidies may be available for renovations.\nIn 2022, the U.S. has about 94,000 NRHP-listed properties, including historic districts; the total number of buildings covered is much larger.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He also had patents for seven other inventions.\nEarly life.\nJack Kilby was born in 1923 in Jefferson City, Missouri, to Hubert and Vina Freitag Kilby. Both parents had Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Illinois. His father was a manager at a local utility company. Kilby grew up and attended school in Great Bend, Kansas, graduating from the Great Bend High School. Today road signs at the entrances to the town commemorate his time there, and the Commons Area at Great Bend High School has been named \"The Jack Kilby Commons Area\".\nKilby received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he was an honorary member of Acacia Fraternity. In 1947, he received a degree in electrical engineering. He earned his Master of Science in electrical engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Extension in Milwaukee.\nCareer.\nKilby was vital to the invention of the integrated circuit. In mid-1958, as a newly employed engineer at Texas Instruments (TI), he did not yet have the right to a summer vacation. Kilby spent the summer working on the problem in circuit design that was commonly called the \"tyranny of numbers\", and he finally came to the conclusion that the manufacturing of circuit components \"en masse\" in a single piece of semiconductor material could provide a solution. On September 12, he presented his findings to company's management, which included Mark Shepherd. He showed them a piece of germanium with an oscilloscope attached, pressed a switch, and the oscilloscope showed a continuous sine wave, proving that his integrated circuit worked, and thus that he had solved the problem. U.S. Patent 3,138,743 for \"Miniaturized Electronic Circuits\", the first integrated circuit, was filed on February 6, 1959. It was notable for having different components (transistors, diodes, resistors, capacitors, etc.) on one single substrate. Along with Robert Noyce (who independently made a similar circuit a few months later), Kilby is generally credited as co-inventor of the integrated circuit.\nJack Kilby went on to pioneer military, industrial, and commercial applications of microchip technology. He headed teams that created the first military system and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. He invented the handheld calculator (along with Jerry Merryman and James Van Tassel).\nIn 1970, he took a leave of absence from TI to work as an independent inventor. He explored, among other subjects, the use of silicon technology for generating electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984, he held the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University.\nIn 1983, Kilby retired from Texas Instruments.\nLegacy.\nHe died of cancer June 20, 2005, at the age of 81, in Dallas, Texas.\nOn December 14, 2005, Texas Instruments created the Historic TI Archives. The Jack Kilby family donated his personal manuscripts and his personal photograph collection to Southern Methodist University (SMU). The collection will be cataloged and stored at DeGolyer Library, SMU.\nIn 2008, the SMU School of Engineering, with the DeGolyer Library and the Library of Congress, hosted a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the digital age with Kilby's Nobel Prize-winning invention of the integrated circuit.

Part of the titular family, Homer made his television debut in the short \"Good Night\" on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening crafted and designed Homer while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Initially called to pitch a series of shorts based on his comic strip \"Life in Hell\", Groening instead developed a new set of characters. After two years on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", the Simpson family received their own series, which premiered on Fox on December 17, 1989.\nHomer is the patriarch of the family; he is married to Marge, with whom he has three children, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's primary provider, Homer primarily works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. He represents numerous American working-class stereotypes: he is overweight, balding, immature, unintelligent, outspoken, aggressive, lazy, ignorant, unprofessional, and deeply fond of beer, junk food, and television. Despite these flaws, Homer is fundamentally a kind-hearted man and fiercely protective of his family, particularly during crucial moments.\nIn the short films and early episodes of \"The Simpsons\", Dan Castellaneta voiced Homer with a loose impression of Walter Matthau. However, starting with the second season of the full-length series, Homer's voice transformed into a stronger tone to effectively express a wider range of emotions. Homer has also been featured in various Simpsons-related media, such as video games, \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007), \"The Simpsons\" Ride, commercials, and comic books, and has sparked a wide array of merchandise. His iconic catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", has been recognized in linguistics, appearing in \"The New Oxford Dictionary of English\" since 1998 and the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" since 2001.\nHomer is regarded as one of the most iconic and influential television characters of all time and is widely recognized as an American cultural icon. In 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Homer ninth on their list of the \"50 Greatest TV Icons,\" and in 2010, placed him first on their list of the \"Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years\". \"The Sunday Times\" referred to him as \"the greatest comic creation of [modern] time\", while TV Guide, in 2002, referred to him as the second-greatest cartoon character (after Bugs Bunny). Castellaneta has received four Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance, along with a special-achievement Annie Award. In 2000, Homer and the family were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nRole in \"The Simpsons\".\nHomer Jay Simpson is the bumbling husband of Marge and the father of Bart, Lisa, and Maggie Simpson. He is the son of Mona and Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson. Over the first 400 episodes of \"The Simpsons\", Homer held over 188 different jobs. His primary role is as a nuclear safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in Sector 7-G. This position, which he is unqualified for, often sees him neglecting his duties or falling asleep on the job. His boss, Mr. Burns, frequently ignores or forgets his existence. Creator Matt Groening chose the nuclear plant as Homer's workplace to provide opportunities for comedic chaos. Although Homer's numerous other jobs each last only one episode, earlier seasons often explained how he was fired from the plant and rehired. In later episodes, these transitions became more impulsive, with his side ventures occurring without reference to his regular employment.\n\"The Simpsons\" employs a floating timeline, where characters either do not age or age minimally. Therefore, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. Despite the show's flexible timeline, several episodes link events in Homer's life to specific time periods. In \"Mother Simpson\" (season seven, 1995), Homer's mother, Mona, is portrayed as a radical who went into hiding in 1969 after a run-in with the law. \"The Way We Was\" (season two, 1991) depicts Homer falling in love with Marge as a senior at Springfield High School in 1974. Similarly, \"I Married Marge\" (season three, 1991) implies that Marge became pregnant with Bart in 1980. However, \"That '90s Show\" (season 19, 2008) contradicts these events, depicting Homer and Marge as a twentysomething, childless couple in the early 1990s. This inconsistency deepens in \"Do Pizza Bots Dream of Electric Guitars\" (season 32, 2021), which reimagines Homer's adolescence as occurring in the 1990s. Showrunner Matt Selman has addressed these contradictions, stating that no version is \"official continuity\" and that \"they all kind of happened in their imaginary world\", allowing viewers to choose the version they prefer.\nHomer's age has fluctuated throughout \"The Simpsons\" due to its floating timeline. In the early episodes, he was thirty-four, increasing to thirty-six in season four, thirty-eight and thirty-nine in season eight, and forty by season eighteen, though these ages are inconsistent even within those seasons. In the episode \"Duffless\" (season four, 1993), Homer's driver's license lists his birthdate as May 12, 1956, making him 36 at the time. During Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein's tenure as showrunners, they aged Homer to thirty-eight, reflecting their own aging and perception of the character. According to the episode guides \"The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family\" (1997) and \"Simpsons World: The Ultimate Episode Guide: Seasons 1\u201320\" (2010), both authored by Groening, Homer's official age is 36. Homer stands tall and weighs between 239 and 260\u00a0lbs (108\u2013120\u00a0kg).\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nMatt Groening first conceived Homer and the rest of the Simpson family in 1987 while waiting in the lobby of producer James L. Brooks's office. Groening was invited to pitch a series of animated shorts for \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" and initially planned to adapt his comic strip, \"Life in Hell\". Upon realizing that adapting the strip would require him to relinquish publication rights, he quickly decided to create something new. Groening hastily sketched a concept for a dysfunctional family, naming the characters after members of his own family. Groening named Homer after his father, who himself had been named after the ancient Greek poet. Very little of Homer's character was inspired by Groening's father, and to emphasize that the significance of the name was minimal, Groening later named his own son Homer. Groening explained, \"Homer originated with my goal to both amuse my real father, and just annoy him a little bit. My father was an athletic, creative, intelligent filmmaker and writer, and the only thing he had in common with Homer was a love of donuts\". On the podcast WTF with Marc Maron, Groening stated in 2025 that the original inspiration for Homer Simpson came from the 1982 PBS documentary series \"Middletown\" about the city of Muncie, Indiana, which contains an episode featuring a Shakey's Pizza franchise manager who employed his own kids to make ends meet.\nWhile Groening has often mentioned that Homer was named after his father, he has also stated in some interviews that the character Homer Simpson from Nathanael West's 1939 novel \"The Day of the Locust\" and its 1975 film adaptation was an inspiration. In a 2012 interview with the Smithsonian Magazine, Groening clarified, \"I took that name from a minor character in the novel \"The Day of the Locust\"[...] Since Homer was my father's name, and I thought Simpson was a funny name in that it had the word \"simp\" in it, which is short for \"simpleton\"\u2014I just went with it\". Homer's middle initial \"J\", which stands for \"Jay\", is a nod to animated characters like Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel from \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\", whose middle initial was a tribute to series creator Jay Ward. Homer first appeared alongside the Simpson family on April 19, 1987, in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" short \"Good Night\". On December 17, 1989, these shorts were developed into \"The Simpsons\", a half-hour series on the Fox Broadcasting Company, where Homer and the Simpson family became the central characters.\nDesign.\nHomer's typical attire includes a short-sleeved white shirt with an open collar, blue pants, and gray shoes. He is overweight and bald, with a fringe of hair around the sides and back of his head and two curly strands on top.\nThe Simpson family was designed to be easily recognizable in silhouette. The characters were initially crudely drawn because Groening submitted rough sketches to the animators, expecting them to refine the designs; instead, the animators simply traced over his original drawings. Homer's appearance has been noted for its resemblance\u2014intentional or not\u2014to the cartoon character Adamsson, created by Swedish cartoonist Oscar Jacobsson in 1920. When Groening originally designed Homer, he incorporated his initials into the character's features: the hairline resembled an \"M\", and the right ear resembled a \"G\". While this design was eventually modified to make the ear appear more natural, Groening continues to draw it as a \"G\" in sketches for fans. Director Mark Kirkland has described Homer's head shape as resembling a tube-shaped coffee can topped with a salad bowl.\nDuring \"The Simpsons\" shorts, animators experimented with Homer's mouth movements, at one point allowing his mouth to stretch beyond his beard line. However, this approach was abandoned when it became overly exaggerated. In early episodes, Homer's hair was more rounded to suggest a disheveled look, but it evolved into the consistently pointed style seen today. During the first three seasons, close-up shots of Homer occasionally included small lines meant to represent eyebrows. Groening disliked this detail, and the lines were eventually removed.\nIn the season seven (1995) episode \"Treehouse of Horror VI\", Bart, alongside Homer, was rendered as a three-dimensional character for the first time in the \"Homer3\" segment of the episode. The computer animation was provided by Pacific Data Images. In the final minute of the segment, the three-dimensional Homer transitions into a live-action setting, finding himself in real-world Los Angeles. Directed by David Mirkin, this marked the first instance of a Simpsons character appearing in the real world within the series. In \"Lisa's Wedding\" (season six, 1995), which is set fifteen years in the future, Homer's design was modified to reflect his older age. Changes included increased weight, the removal of one hair from the top of his head, and the addition of an extra line under his eye. This older design has since been used in subsequent flashforward episodes.\nVoice.\nHomer's voice is provided by Dan Castellaneta. Castellaneta also voices several other characters on \"The Simpsons\", including Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Barney Gumble, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, and Hans Moleman.\nCastellaneta, a regular cast member on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", had prior experience in voice-over work, which he had done in Chicago alongside his wife, Deb Lacusta. When voices were needed for \"The Simpsons\" shorts, the producers chose Castellaneta and fellow cast member Julie Kavner to voice Homer and Marge, respectively, opting not to hire additional actors. In the shorts and the first season of the half-hour series, Homer's voice differed noticeably from its later incarnation. Initially, it was modeled as a loose impression of Walter Matthau but Castellaneta found it challenging to maintain the Matthau-inspired tone during the nine- to ten-hour recording sessions and sought a more sustainable approach. By the second and third seasons, Castellaneta had \"dropped the voice down\" and developed it into a more versatile and humorous style, enabling Homer to express a broader range of emotions.\nCastellaneta's natural speaking voice bears no resemblance to Homer's. To create Homer's voice, Castellaneta lowers his chin to his chest and adopts what he describes as a state of \"letting his I.Q. go\". This method has even led to ad-libs, including the famous \"S-M-R-T; I mean, S-M-A-R-T!\" line from \"Homer Goes to College\" (season five, 1993), which stemmed from a genuine recording mistake. Castellaneta prefers to stay in character during recording sessions and visualizes scenes to deliver the appropriate vocal performance. Despite Homer's widespread fame, Castellaneta says he is rarely recognized in public\u2014unless by an especially dedicated fan. In \"Homer's Barbershop Quartet\" (season five, 1993), Homer's voice was partially performed by someone other than Castellaneta. The episode follows Homer forming a barbershop quartet called the Be Sharps, with his singing voice provided at times by a member of the Dapper Dans. The Dapper Dans recorded the singing parts for all four members of the group, blending their vocals with the regular voice actors. Often, a primary voice actor sang the melody while the Dapper Dans provided harmonic backup.\nCastellaneta was initially paid US$30,000 per episode for his work on \"The Simpsons\" until 1998. That year, a pay dispute arose, during which Fox threatened to replace the six main voice actors and even began preparing for new casting. The conflict was ultimately resolved, and Castellaneta's salary increased to $125,000 per episode. In 2004, the voice cast pushed for higher wages, seeking $360,000 per episode. After a brief argument, the dispute was settled, and Castellaneta's pay was raised to $250,000 per episode. In 2008, further negotiations increased the cast's salaries to approximately $400,000 per episode. However, in 2011, Fox demanded production cost reductions, threatening to cancel the series if costs were not cut. In response, Castellaneta and the other main cast members agreed to a 30percent pay reduction, lowering their per-episode earnings to just over $300,000. According to \"Backstage\", he was the sixth highest-paid voice actor by late 2024.\nCharacter development.\nExecutive producer Al Jean observes that in \"The Simpsons\" writers' room, \"everyone loves writing for Homer\", with many of his antics inspired by the writers' own experiences. In the show's early seasons, Bart was the main character, but by the fourth season, Homer took on a more prominent role. Groening explained this shift: \"With Homer, there's just a wider range of jokes you can do. And there are far more drastic consequences to Homer's stupidity. There's only so far you can go with a juvenile delinquent. We wanted Bart to do anything up to the point of him being tried in court an adult. But Homer is an adult, and his boneheaded-ness is funnier. [...] Homer is launching himself headfirst into every single impulsive thought that occurs to him\".\nHomer's character has evolved significantly over the course of \"The Simpsons\". Initially, he was portrayed as \"very angry\" and domineering toward Bart, but these traits were softened as his personality was developed further. In the early seasons, Homer often worried that his family might embarrass him, but in later episodes, he became less concerned with others' opinions. During the show's first years, Homer was depicted as dim-witted yet well-meaning. As noted by Jon Bonn\u00e9 of \"Today\", somewhere around the seventh season, his behavior shifted toward being a \"boorish, self-aggrandizing oaf\". Chris Suellentrop of \"Slate\" observed, \"Under Mike Scully's tenure [as executive producer], \"The Simpsons\" became, well, a cartoon.[...] Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck\". Fans have labeled this version of the character as \"Jerkass Homer\". At recording sessions, Castellaneta has occasionally rejected lines from the script that he felt made Homer too cruel. He believes Homer is \"boorish and unthinking, but he'd never be mean on purpose\". When \"The Simpsons Movie\" (2007) was being edited, several scenes were adjusted to make Homer more sympathetic.\nOver the years, the writers have portrayed Homer with increasingly declining intelligence. They explain this was not done intentionally but became necessary to surpass earlier jokes. For instance, in \"When You Dish Upon a Star\" (season 10, 1998), Homer admits he cannot read. Although this contradicts earlier scenes where Homer is shown reading, the writers decided to keep the gag because they found it funny. The team often debates how far to take Homer's stupidity, with one suggested guideline being that \"he can never forget his own name\".\nPersonality.\nThe comedic appeal of Homer's character stems from his frequent displays of bumbling stupidity, laziness, and explosive temper. With a low intelligence level, director David Silverman has described him as \"creatively brilliant in his stupidity\". Homer is characterized by his immense apathy towards work, overweight body, love for food, and short attention span. He frequently spends his evenings drinking Duff Beer at Moe's Tavern and, as depicted in the episode \"Duffless\" (season four, 1993), has exhibited signs of full-blown alcoholism. A recurring gag throughout the series involves Homer impulsively strangling Bart whenever he aggravates him, often accompanied by his catchphrase, \"Why you little\u2014!\". According to series creator Groening, Homer's strangling of Bart was never meant to be premeditated, as that would make it seem sadistic. Instead, it was made that Homer acts purely on impulse, easily switching from anger to indifference. Groening initially considered making Homer always receive a punishment or having Bart retaliate, but this was discarded. In the episode \"McMansion &amp; Wife\" (season 35, 2023), Homer states that he no longer strangles Bart, citing changing times. However, the show's executive producers later clarified that Homer still strangles Bart, humorously noting, \"Homer Simpson was unavailable for comment as he was busy strangling Bart\".\nHomer has nuanced relationships with his family. His relationship with Bart is the most contentious; Bart frequently calls Homer by his first name rather than \"Dad\", and Homer often refers to him dismissively as \"the boy\". Homer frequently overlooks Lisa's talents but, when confronted with his neglect, goes out of his way to support her. The episode \"And Maggie Makes Three\" (season six, 1995) reveals she is the main reason Homer took and continues to work at his regular job. While Homer's thoughtless antics often frustrate his family, he has proven himself to be a loving husband; for instance, in \"A Milhouse Divided\" (season eight, 1996), Homer arranged a surprise second wedding with Marge to make up for their unsatisfactory first ceremony. He has a strained relationship with his father, Abraham \"Grampa\" Simpson, and Homer quickly placed him in a nursing home.\nHomer was described by \"The Times\" as \"a (happy) slave to his various appetites\". He is known for his consistent ignorance, forgetfulness, and general stupidity. Homer's low intelligence quotient (IQ) of 55 has been attributed to several factors, including the hereditary \"Simpson gene\" (which causes male family members to become increasingly unintelligent over time) and a crayon lodged in his brain's frontal lobe. In the episode \"HOMR\" (season 12, 2001), Homer has the crayon removed, temporarily raising his IQ to 105. This improvement allows him to bond with Lisa, but his newfound intelligence ultimately makes him unhappy, leading him to have the crayon reinserted. In 2015, it was revealed that Homer has narcolepsy, a sleep disorder.\nProducer Mike Reiss said Homer was his favorite \"Simpsons\" character to write: \"Homer's just a comedy writer's dream. He has everything wrong with him, every comedy trope. He's fat and bald and stupid and lazy and angry and an alcoholic. I'm pretty sure he embodies all seven deadly sins\". John Swartzwelder, who wrote 60 episodes, said he wrote Homer as if he were \"a big talking dog ... One moment he's the saddest man in the world, because he's just lost his job, or dropped his sandwich, or accidentally killed his family. Then, the next moment, he's the happiest man in the world, because he's just found a penny \u2014 maybe under one of his dead family members ... If you write him as a dog you'll never go wrong\". Reiss felt this was insightful, saying: \"Homer is just pure emotion, no long-term memory, everything is instant gratification. And, you know, has good dog qualities, too. I think, loyalty, friendliness, and just kind of continuous optimism\".\nReception.\nCultural influence and commendations.\nHomer is widely regarded as one of the most popular and iconic characters in television history. In 2007, \"USA Today\" recognized Homer Simpson as one of the \"top 25 most influential people of the past 25 years\", stating that he \"epitomized the irony and irreverence at the core of American humor\". In 2003, Robert Thompson, director of Syracuse University's Center for the Study of Popular Television, predicts that \"three centuries from now, English professors are going to be regarding Homer Simpson as one of the greatest creations in human storytelling\". Animation historian Jerry Beck described Homer as one of the best animated characters, saying, \"you know someone like it, or you identify with (it)\", which he believed is key to a classic character. \"The Sunday Times\" has hailed Homer as \"the greatest comic creation of [modern] time,\" emphasizing his universal appeal. The article noted, \"Every age needs its great, consoling failure, its lovable, pretension-free mediocrity. And we have ours in Homer Simpson\".\nHomer's impact on comedy and culture has been significant. In 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named him \"the greatest character of the last 20 years\". In TV Guide's 2002 list of the \"Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters\", he was ranked second, behind Bugs Bunny. He also placed fifth on Bravo's \"100 Greatest TV Characters\", one of only four animated characters included. Homer topped a Channel 4 poll ranking the greatest television characters of all time. In 2007, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Homer ninth on its list of the \"50 Greatest TV Icons\" and later placed him first on its 2010 list of the \"Top 100 Characters of the Past Twenty Years\". British polls conducted by the BBC also named Homer the \"greatest American\" and the fictional character voters would most like to see as President of the United States. His relationship with Marge was further recognized in TV Guide's list of \"The Best TV Couples of All Time\". In 2022, \"Paste\" writers ranked Homer as the second-greatest cartoon character of all time.\nAlthough Homer is often regarded as a reflection of American culture, his influence extends worldwide. In 2003, Groening revealed that his father, Homer Groening\u2014after whom the character was named\u2014was Canadian, suggesting that Homer could also be considered Canadian. As a result, the character was granted honorary citizenship in Winnipeg, Manitoba, based on the belief that Homer Groening was from there, though records indicate he was actually born in Saskatchewan. In 2007, as part of a promotion for \"The Simpsons Movie\", an image of Homer was painted next to the Cerne Abbas Giant in Dorset, England. This sparked controversy among local neopagan groups, who performed \"rain magic\" in an attempt to wash the image away.\nCastellaneta has received multiple awards for his portrayal of Homer, including four Primetime Emmy Awards for \"Outstanding Voice-Over Performance\". He won in 1992 for \"Lisa's Pony\", in 1993 for \"Mr. Plow\", in 2004 for \"Today I Am a Clown\", and in 2009 for \"Father Knows Worst\". However, his 2004 Emmy win was for voicing various characters, not solely Homer. In 2010, Castellaneta received a fifth Emmy nomination for his performances as both Homer and Grampa Simpson in \"Thursdays with Abie\". Castellaneta was honored with an Annie Award in 1993 for \"Outstanding Individual Achievement in the Field of Animation\" for his work on \"The Simpsons\". In 2004, he and Julie Kavner (the voice of Marge) won a Young Artist Award for \"Most Popular Mom &amp; Dad in a TV Series\". In 2000, Homer and the rest of the Simpson family were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 7021 Hollywood Boulevard. Homer has also been referenced in scientific literature, particularly in discussions of cognitive function. A 2010 study conducted at Emory University found that the RGS14 gene appeared to impair cognitive development in mice\u2014while disabling the gene led to improved cognitive abilities. This led researchers to nickname it the \"Homer Simpson gene\".\nAnalysis.\nHomer is an \"everyman\" and embodies several American stereotypes of working class blue-collar men: he is crude, overweight, incompetent, dim-witted, childish, clumsy and a borderline alcoholic. Groening describes him as \"completely ruled by his impulses\". Castellaneta calls him \"a dog trapped in a man's body\", adding, \"He's incredibly loyal\u2014not entirely clean\u2014but you gotta love him.\"\nIn his book \"Planet Simpson\", author Chris Turner describes Homer as \"the most American of the Simpsons\" and believes that while the other Simpson family members could be changed to other nationalities, Homer is \"pure American\". In the book \"God in the Details: American Religion in Popular Culture\", the authors comment that \"Homer's progress (or lack thereof) reveals a character who can do the right thing, if accidentally or begrudgingly.\" The book \"\" includes a chapter analyzing Homer's character from the perspective of Aristotelian virtue ethics. Raja Halwani writes that Homer's \"love of life\" is an admirable character trait, \"for many people are tempted to see in Homer nothing but buffoonery and immorality.\u00a0... He is not politically correct, he is more than happy to judge others, and he certainly does not seem to be obsessed with his health. These qualities might not make Homer an admirable \"person\", but they do make him admirable in some ways, and, more importantly, makes us crave him and the Homer Simpsons of this world.\" In 2008, \"Entertainment Weekly\" justified designating \"The Simpsons\" as a television classic by stating, \"we all hail Simpson patriarch Homer because his joy is as palpable as his stupidity is stunning\".\nIn the season eight episode \"Homer's Enemy\" the writers decided to examine \"what it would be like to actually work alongside Homer Simpson\". The episode explores the possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic named Frank Grimes placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; however, in some scenes his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the end of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering \"real American hero\", has become the villain; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.\nIn \"Gilligan Unbound\", author Paul Arthur Cantor states that he believes Homer's devotion to his family has added to the popularity of the character. He writes, \"Homer is the distillation of pure fatherhood.\u00a0... This is why, for all his stupidity, bigotry and self-centered quality, we cannot hate Homer. He continually fails at being a good father, but he never gives up trying, and in some basic and important sense that makes him a good father.\" \"The Sunday Times\" remarked \"Homer is good because, above all, he is capable of great love. When the chips are down, he always does the right thing by his children\u2014he is never unfaithful in spite of several opportunities.\"\nD'oh!\nHomer's main and most famous catchphrase, the annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", is typically uttered when he injures himself, realizes that he has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or is about to happen to him. During the voice recording session for a \"Tracey Ullman Show\" short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an \"annoyed grunt\". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out \"d'ooooooh\". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word \"Damn!\" Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered \"D'oh!\". The first intentional use of \"D'oh!\" occurred in the Ullman short \"The Krusty the Clown Show\" (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\".\n\"D'oh!\" was first added to \"The New Oxford Dictionary of English\" in 1998. It is defined as an interjection \"used to comment on an action perceived as foolish or stupid\". In 2001, \"D'oh!\" was added to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", without the apostrophe (\"Doh!\"). The definition of the word is \"expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish\". In 2006, \"D'oh!\" was placed in sixth position on TV Land's list of the 100 greatest television catchphrases. \"D'oh!\" is also included in \"The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations\". The book includes several other quotations from Homer, including \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \"Burns' Heir\" (season five, 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \"Eight Misbehavin'\" (season 11, 1999). Both quotes entered the dictionary in August 2007.\nMerchandising.\nHomer and other members of his family have been featured in a variety of \"The Simpsons\"-related merchandise, which includes dolls, napkins, air fresheners, cups, chewing gum, beach towels, sleeping bags, snow boots, rubber sponge balls, license-plate frames, scratch paper, laminated magnets, and handheld pinball games. One book, \"The Homer Book\" (2004), has been published on the character, which discusses his personality and attributes. The \"News Letter\"'s Simon Hunter described it as \"an entertaining little book for occasional reading\" and was listed as one of \"the most interesting books of 2004\" by \"The Chattanoogan\".\nHomer has appeared in commercials for several brands, including Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and Kodak. Homer and other \"Simpsons\" characters appeared in television commercials for Nestl\u00e9's Butterfinger candy bars from 1988 to 2001. Groening later noted that the success of the Butterfinger commercials played a significant role in Fox's decision to greenlight the half-hour series. In 2001, Kelloggs launched a brand of cereal called \"Homer's Cinnamon Donut Cereal\", which was available for a limited time. In June 2009, Dutch automotive navigation systems manufacturer TomTom announced that Homer would be added to its downloadable GPS voice lineup. Homer's voice, recorded by Dan Castellaneta, features several in-character comments such as \"Take the third right. We might find an ice cream truck! Mmm... ice cream.\"\nHomer has appeared in other media relating to \"The Simpsons\". He has appeared in every one of \"The Simpsons\" video games, including \"The Simpsons\" (1991) and \"The Simpsons Game\" (2007). Alongside the television series, Homer regularly appeared in issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", which were published from November 29, 1993, until October 17, 2018. Homer also plays a role in \"The Simpsons\" Ride, launched in 2008 at Universal Studios Florida and Hollywood. On December 9, 2024, \"Monday Night Football\" hosted an animated \"Simpsons\" version of the Cincinnati Bengals-Dallas Cowboys game, which paralleled the events on the field. In November 2025, Homer appeared in the \"Fortnite\" x \"Simpsons\" mini season, as a skin for players to purchase.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Traditional occupations of indigenous people\u2014such as fishing, farming, and hunting\u2014tended to involve constant activity, whereas modern office jobs do not. The introduction of modern transportation such as automobiles also decreased physical exertion.

It became the world's leading manufacturer of newspaper and book typesetting equipment. Its main competitor was the American Intertype Corporation and the British-American Monotype Corporation.\nStarting in the late 1950s, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company became a major supplier of phototypesetting equipment which included laser typesetters, raster image processors, scanners, and typesetting computers.\nIn 1987, the US-based Mergenthaler Linotype Company became part of the German Linotype-Hell AG; in the US the company name changed to Linotype Co. In 1996, the German Linotype-Hell AG was taken over by the German printing machine company Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. A separate business, Linotype Library GmbH was established to manage the digital assets (mainly fonts).\nIn 2005, Linotype Library GmbH shortened its name to Linotype GmbH, and in 2006, Linotype GmbH was acquired by Monotype Imaging Holdings, Inc., the parent of Monotype Imaging, Inc. and others. In 2013, Linotype GmbH officially ends when it is renamed Monotype GmbH. In August 2023, Monotype announced that it was discontinuing Linotype.com, effectively closing the business.\nFounding.\nThe invention of a machine to replace the labor-intensive task of setting type by hand had been tackled by many inventors during the 19th century. The most time consumed was not in creating the text, but in returning the characters to their proper position for future use. Ottmar Mergenthaler solved this problem by placing a type mold for a letter on the side of a specially keyed matrix (with multiple matrix/molds available for any given letter). The linotype operator would type in a line of text. The machine would drop each matrix with its mold into place, assembling the matrices into a line of text that was needed. Hot lead alloy was then forced into the molds of matrices, creating the fresh line of type.\nThe linotype operator would then go on to type in the next line. Multiple lines would be stacked into blocks, sometimes paragraphs, to be set in place in the proper column of the page layout. Meanwhile, back inside the linotype machine, the matrices used for a line \nwould progress through the machine, where the special keying system on one end of the matrix, unique for each character, would allow the matrix to drop back only into the correct storage slot, ready for the next use. Another benefit of this overall process was that each edition of the paper was created from a fresh casting of metal, thus avoiding problems of type wear.\nAnother problem Mergenthaler solved was in justifying the type, or ensuring that in a column of print, there were flush margins on the left and right. Hand compositors had previously done this by inserting spaces of different widths between words in a line, to ensure that the lines all aligned. Mergenthaler adapted the \u201cspaceband\u201d (patent awarded to J. W. Schuckers), a device consisting of two opposing wedges of connected metal which expand when pushed in opposite directions. When a line of type was being justified, all the spaceband wedges would be pushed up by the justification-slide block to spread the line out to the full measure (all the way to the left and right width) being cast. The spacebands were stored for reuse in the spaceband box; a different location from the matrices (which were stored in the magazin).\nHistory.\nThe invention of the first working Linotype was a long, arduous and intricate process that involved many players and the creation of a long succession of companies.\nIn 1877, the National Printing Company was organized under the laws of the District of Columbia and Lewis Clephane, the brother of James O. Clephane, was elected president. After the first successful trial of the Linotype in October, 1885, the Mergenthaler Printing Company was established to raise fresh capital from the shareholders of the National Printing Company. Finally, The Mergenthaler Linotype Company was formed in New York in 1895. Philip Tell Dodge served as its first president until 1928 when his son Norman Dodge replaced him. The Mergenthaler Linotype Company of New York, the organization's newest iteration, was launched with $5,000,000 capital (in 1895 dollars), and $10,000,000 (in 1895 dollars) in stock holdings across 333 investors.\nIn 1889 The Linotype Company, a British offshoot of the firm, was formed by Joseph Lawrence, publisher of \"The Railway Magazine\". In 1899, a new factory in Broadheath, Altrincham was opened. In 1903, the British company merged with Machinery Trust to form Linotype &amp; Machinery Ltd.\nMergenthaler Linotype dominated the printing industry through the twentieth century. The machines were so well designed, major parts remained virtually unchanged for nearly 100 years. A particularly notable success was Linotype's Legibility Group of typefaces, used by most of the world's (Latin-alphabet) newspapers for much of the twentieth century. The ruggedness of the Linotype system, which cast lines as solid bars of type, aided this dominance.\nLinotype Company was merged with Mergenthaler acquisition K. S. Paul to form Linotype-Paul Ltd which developed a range of Linotron phototypesetters using K. S. Paul's cathode ray tube technology.\nThe company, as so many in the printing industry, endured a complex post-war history, during which printing technology went through two revolutions \u2014 first moving to phototypesetting, then to digital.\nDuring the 1950s, the Davidson Corporation, which manufactured a series of small offset presses, was a subsidiary of Linotype. This was later sold to American Type Founders and operated under the name ATF-Davidson.\nThrough a series of mergers and reorganizations, the business of Mergenthaler Linotype Company ultimately vested in Linotype-Hell AG, a German company. In April 1997, Linotype-Hell AG was acquired by Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. The following month certain divisions of Linotype-Hell AG were spun off into new companies, one of which was \"Linotype Library GmbH\" with headquarters at Bad Homburg vor der H\u00f6he. This new company was responsible solely for the acquisition, creation and distribution of digital fonts and related software. This spin-off effectively divorced the company's font software business from the older typesetting business which was retained by Heidelberg.\nIn 2005, Linotype Library GmbH shortened its name to Linotype GmbH, and in 2007, Linotype GmbH was acquired by Monotype Imaging Holdings, Inc., the parent of Monotype Imaging, Inc. and others.\nIn August 2023, Monotype announced that it would be closing the Linotype e-commerce platform, together with FontShop and Fonts.com. Monotype stated that it could no longer maintain its desired level of quality across the platforms and would instead be focussing its efforts on developing its MyFonts site. The company pledged to preserve Linotype\u2019s history and legacy online with stories and content.\nTypefaces.\nThe typefaces in the Linotype type library are the artwork of some of the most famous typeface designers of the 20th century. The library contains such famous trademarked typefaces as Palatino and Optima by Hermann Zapf; Frutiger, Avenir and Univers by Adrian Frutiger; and Helvetica by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffman. Linotype GmbH frequently brings out new designs from both established and new type designers. Linotype had also introduced FontExplorer X for Mac OS X. It was a well-reviewed font manager that allows users to browse and purchase new fonts within the program \u2014 a business model similar to that used by iTunes and the iTunes Store.\nThe Arabic typeface Simplified Arabic, later called Yakout for the 13th-century Islamic calligrapher Yaqut al-Musta'simi, was released by Linotype in 1956, and remains one of the most common Arabic typefaces for books and newspapers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is also known as \"high in fat, salt and sugar food\" (HFSS food). The term \"junk food\" is a pejorative dating back to the 1950s.\nPrecise definitions vary by purpose and over time. Some high-protein foods, like meat prepared with saturated fat, may be considered junk food. Fast food and fast-food restaurants are often equated with junk food, although fast foods cannot be categorically described as junk food. Candy, soft drinks, and highly processed foods such as certain breakfast cereals, are generally included in the junk food category; much of it is ultra-processed food.\nConcerns about the negative health effects resulting from a junk food-heavy diet, especially obesity, have resulted in public health awareness campaigns, and restrictions on advertising and sale in several countries. Current studies indicate that a diet high in junk food can increase the risk of depression, digestive issues, heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and early death.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"junk food\" dates back at least to the early 1950s, although its coinage has been credited to Michael F. Jacobson of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, in 1972. In 1952, the phrase appeared in a headline in the Lima, Ohio, \"News\", \"'Junk Foods' Cause Serious Malnutrition\", over a reprint of a 1948 article from the Ogden, Utah, \"Standard-Examiner\", originally titled, \"Dr. Brady's Health Column: More Junk Than Food\". In the article, Dr. Brady writes, \"What Mrs. H calls 'junk' I call cheat food. That is anything made principally of (1) white flour and or (2) refined white sugar or syrup. For example, white bread, crackers, cake, candy, ice cream soda, chocolate malted, sundaes, sweetened carbonated beverages.\" The term \"cheat food\" can be traced back in newspaper mentions to at least 1916.\nDefinitions.\nIn Andrew F. Smith's \"Encyclopedia of Junk Food and Fast Food\", junk food is defined as \"those commercial products, including candy, bakery goods, ice cream, salty snacks and soft drinks, which have little or no nutritional value but do have plenty of calories, salt, and fats. While not all fast foods are junk foods, many of them are. Fast foods are ready-to-eat foods served promptly after ordering. Some fast foods are high in calories and low in nutritional value, while other fast foods, such as salads, may be low in calories and high in nutritional value.\"\nJunk food provides empty calories, supplying little or none of the protein, vitamins, or minerals required for a nutritious diet. Some foods, such as hamburgers, and tacos, can be considered either healthy or junk food, depending on their ingredients and preparation methods. The more highly processed items usually fall under the junk food category, including breakfast cereals that are mostly sugar or high fructose corn syrup and white flour or milled corn.\nJunk food can be defined through nutrient profiling. The United Kingdom's Advertising Standards Authority, the self-regulatory agency for the UK ad industry, takes this approach. Foods are scored for \"A\" nutrients (energy, saturated fat, total sugar, and sodium) and \"C\" nutrients (fruit, vegetable, and nut content, fiber, and protein). The difference between A and C scores determines whether a food or beverage is categorized as HFSS (high in fat, salt and sugar; a term synonymous with \"junk food\"). Defining junk food as highly processed or ultra-processed food mainly considers the level of processing rather than nutrient profiles.\nIn \"Panic Nation: Unpicking the Myths We're Told About Food and Health\", the junk food label is described as nutritionally meaningless: food is food, and if there is zero nutritional value, then it is not a food. Co-editor Vincent Marks explains, \"To label a food as 'junk' is just another way of saying, 'I disapprove of it.' There are bad diets \u2013 that is, bad mixtures and quantities of food \u2013 but there are no 'bad foods' except those that have become bad through contamination or deterioration.\"\nHistory.\nAccording to an article in the \"New York Times\", \"Let Us Now Praise the Great Men of Junk Food\", \"The history of junk food is a largely American tale: It has been around for hundreds of years, in many parts of the world, but no one has done a better job inventing so many varieties of it, branding it, mass-producing it, making people rich off it and, of course, eating it.\" Cracker Jack, the candy-coated popcorn-and-peanuts confection, is credited as the first popular name-brand junk food; it was created in Chicago, registered in 1896, and became the best-selling candy in the world 20 years later.\nPopularity and appeal.\nJunk food in its various forms is an integral part of modern popular culture. In the US, annual fast food sales are in the area of $160 billion, compared to supermarket sales of $620 billion (a figure which also includes junk food in the form of convenience foods, snack foods, and candy). In 1976, \"Junk Food Junkie\", a US top 10 pop song, described a junk food addict who pretends to follow a healthy diet by day, while at night gorging on Hostess Twinkies and Fritos corn chips, McDonald's and KFC. Thirty-six years later, \"Time\" placed the Twinkie at #1 in an article titled, \"Top 10 Iconic Junk Foods\": \"Not only...a mainstay on our supermarket shelves and in our bellies, they've been a staple in our popular culture and, above all, in our hearts. Often criticized for its lack of any nutritional value whatsoever, the Twinkie has managed to persevere as a cultural and gastronomical icon.\"\nAmerica also celebrates an annual National Junk Food Day on July 21. Origins are unclear; it is one of around 175 US food and drink days, most created by \"people who want to sell more food\", at times aided by elected officials at the request of a trade association or commodity group. \"In honor of the day,\" \"Time\" in 2014 published, \"5 Crazy Junk Food Combinations\". Headlines from other national and local media coverage include: \"Celebrate National Junk Food Day With... Beer-Flavored Oreos?\" (MTV); \"National Junk Food Day: Pick your favorite unhealthy treats in this poll\" (Baltimore); \"Celebrities' favorite junk food\" (Los Angeles); \"A Nutritionist's Guide to National Junk Food Day\" with \"Rules for Splurging\" (\"Huffington Post\"); and \"It's National Junk Food Day: Got snacks?\" (Kansas City).\nAs for the source of junk food's appeal, there is no definitive scientific answer; both physiological and psychological factors are cited. Food manufacturers spend billions of dollars on research and development to create flavor profiles that trigger the human affinity for sugar, salt, and fat. Consumption results in pleasurable, likely addictive, effects on the brain. At the same time, massive marketing efforts are deployed, creating powerful brand loyalties that studies have shown can trump taste.\nIt is well-established that the poor eat more junk food overall than the more affluent, but the reasons for this are unclear. Few studies have focused on variations in food perception according to socio-economic status (SES); some studies that have differentiated based on SES suggest that the economically challenged do not perceive healthy food much differently than any other population segment. Recent research into scarcity, combining behavioral science and economics, suggests that, faced with extreme economic uncertainty, where even the next meal may not be a sure thing, judgment is impaired and the drive is to the instant gratification of junk food, rather than to make the necessary investment in the longer-term benefits of a healthier diet.\nHealth effects.\nWhen junk food is consumed very often, the excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar found in junk food contribute to an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and many other chronic health conditions. A case study on the consumption of fast foods in Ghana suggested a direct correlation between consumption of junk food and obesity rates. The report asserts that obesity resulted in related complex health concerns such as an upsurge in the rate of heart attacks. Studies reveal that as early as the age of 30, arteries could begin clogging and lay the groundwork for future heart attacks. Consumers also tend to eat too much in one sitting, and those who have satisfied their appetite with junk food are less likely to eat healthy foods like fruit or vegetables.\nTesting on rats has indicated negative effects of junk food that may manifest likewise in people. A Scripps Research Institute study in 2008 suggested that junk food consumption alters brain activity in a manner similar to addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin. After many weeks with unlimited access to junk food, the pleasure centers of rat brains became desensitized, requiring more food for pleasure; after the junk food was taken away and replaced with a healthy diet, the rats starved for two weeks instead of eating nutritious fare. A 2007 study in the \"British Journal of Nutrition\" found that female rats who eat junk food during pregnancy increased the likelihood of unhealthy eating habits in their offspring.\nOther research has been done on the impact of sugary foods on human emotional health and has suggested that consuming junk food can negatively impact energy levels and emotional well-being.\nIn a study published in the \"European Journal of Clinical Nutrition\", the frequency of consumption of 57 foods/drinks of 4,000 children at the age of four and a half were collected by maternal report. At age seven, the 4,000 children were given the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), with five scales: hyperactivity, conduct problems, peer problems, emotional symptoms, and pro-social behavior. A one standard deviation increase in junk food was then linked to excessive hyperactivity in 33% of the subjects, leading to the conclusion that children consuming excess junk food at the age of seven are more likely to be in the top third of the hyperactivity scale. There was no significant correlation between junk food and the other scales.\nAnti-junk food measures.\nSeveral countries have taken, or are considering, various forms of legislative action to curb junk food consumption. Eating habits can be influenced by the food environment around us. In 2014, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Anand Grover, released his report, \"Unhealthy foods, non-communicable diseases and the right to health\", and called for governments to \"take measures, such as developing food and nutrition guidelines for healthy diets, regulating marketing and advertising of junk food, adopting consumer-friendly labeling of food products, and establishing accountability mechanisms for violations of the right to health.\"\nAn early, high-profile, and controversial attempt to identify and curb junk food in the American diet was undertaken by the McGovern Committee (United States Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, chaired by Senator George McGovern) between 1968 and 1977. Initially formed to investigate malnutrition and hunger in the US, the committee's scope progressively expanded to include environmental conditions that affected eating habits, such as urban decay, then focused on the diet and nutritional habits of the American public. The committee took issue with the use of salt, sugar, and fat in processed foods, noted problems with overeating and the high percentage of ads for junk food on TV, and stated that bad eating habits could be as deadly as smoking. The findings were heavily criticized and rebutted from many directions, including the food industry, the American Medical Association, and the committee itself. In 1977, the committee issued public guidelines under the title, \"Dietary Goals for the United States\", which became the predecessor to \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\", published every five years beginning in 1980 by the US Department of Health and Human Services.\nComprehensive measures.\nIn 2016, Chile became the first country to implement comprehensive nutritional quality measures aimed at consumers, with the Law of Food Labeling and Advertising. The statute mandated front-of-package warning labels, restricted marketing to children, and banned in-school sales of food and drink containing excessive sugar, salt, or saturated fat. \nTaxation.\nTo reduce junk food consumption through price control, sin taxes have been implemented. Targeting saturated fat consumption, Denmark introduced the world's first fat-food tax in October 2011 by imposing a surcharge on all foods, including those made from natural ingredients, that contain more than 2.3 percent saturated fat, an unpopular measure that lasted a little over a year. Hungary has imposed taxes on foods and beverages high in added sugar, fat, and salt. Norway taxes refined sugar, and Mexico has various excises on unhealthy food. On April 1, 2015, the first fat tax in the US, the Navajo Nation's Healthy Din\u00e9 Nation Act of 2014, mandating a 2% junk food tax, came into effect, covering the Navajo reservation; the Act targeted problems with obesity and diabetes among the Navajo population.\nBanning junk food advertisements.\nIn mid-2021, the government of the United Kingdom proposed policies that would call for a ban on online advertisements of foods high in fat, salt, and sugar, in addition to an additional ban on advertising such foods on television before 9:00 pm local time. The bans would not affect advertisements that do not directly promote a junk food product, and promoting these products on company webpages and social media accounts would remain permitted. The bans were intended to come into force in 2023, but they will become effective from 1 October, 2025.\nIn October 2021, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs of Spain, under the leadership of minister Alberto Garz\u00f3n, announced a ban on the advertising of several categories of junk food to children under 16. Such advertising would be forbidden on television, radio, online, in movie theaters, and in newspapers. Affected foods include candy, energy bars, cookies, cake, juice, energy drinks, and ice cream. The ban is to take effect in 2022.\nRestricting advertising to children.\nJunk food that is targeted at children is a contentious issue. In \"The Impact of Advertising on Childhood obesity\", the American Psychological Association reports: \"Research has found strong associations between increases in advertising for non-nutritious foods and rates of childhood obesity.\" Advertising of unhealthy foods to children increases their consumption of the product and positive attitudes (liking or wanting to buy) about the advertised product. Children's critical reasoning (the ability to understand what an advertisement is and the aim of advertising to buy the product) is not protective against the impact of advertising, and does not appear to be fully developed during adolescence.\nThe World Health Organization recommends that governments take action to limit children's exposure to food marketing, stating, \"Many advertisements promote foods high in fats, sugar, and salt, consumption of which should be limited as part of a healthy diet. ... Food advertising and other forms of marketing have been shown to influence children's food preferences, purchasing behaviour and overall dietary behaviour. Marketing has also been associated with an increased risk of overweight and obesity in children. The habits children develop early in life may encourage them to adopt unhealthy dietary practices which persist into adulthood, increasing the likelihood of overweight, obesity and associated health problems such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.\"\nIn the United Kingdom, efforts to increasingly limit or eliminate advertising of foods high in sugar, salt, or fat at any time children may be viewing are ongoing. The UK government has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop advertising and promotion of junk food aimed at children. A UK parliamentary select committee recommended that cartoon characters advertising unhealthy food to children should be banned, supermarkets should have to remove unhealthy sweets and snacks from ends of aisles and checkout areas, local authorities should be able to limit the number of fast food outlets in their area, brands associated with unhealthy foods should be banned from sponsoring sports clubs, youth leagues and tournaments, and social media like Facebook should cut down junk food advertising to children\u00a0\u2013 all are currently just recommendations.\nIn Australia, a Wollongong University study in 2015 found that junk food sponsors were mentioned over 1,000 times in a single Australian cricket match broadcast, which included ads and branding worn on players' uniforms and on the scoreboard and pitch. A coalition of Australian obesity, cancer, and diabetes organizations called on Cricket Australia, the sport's governing body, to \"phase out sponsorships with unhealthy brands\", emphasizing that cricket is a \"healthy, family-oriented sport\" with children in the audience.\nRestricting sales to minors.\nSeveral states in Mexico banned sales of junk food to minors, starting in August 2020.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons or candy bars, as a topping for ice cream and custard, and as a colorant commonly used in drinks.\nThe process of caramelization primarily consists of heating sugars slowly to around . As the sugar heats, the molecules break down and re-form into compounds with a characteristic colour and flavour.\nA variety of sweets, desserts, toppings, and confections are made with caramel, including tres leches cake, brittles, nougats, pralines, flan, cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me caramel, and caramel apples. Ice creams are sometimes flavored with or contain swirls of caramel.\nEtymology.\nThe English word comes from French ', borrowed from Spanish (18th century), itself possibly from Portuguese '. Most likely that comes from Late Latin ' 'sugar cane', a diminutive of 'reed, cane', itself from Greek . Less likely, it comes from Medieval Latin ', from 'cane' + 'honey'. Finally, some dictionaries connect it to Arabic 'ball of sweet'.\nSauce.\nCaramel sauce is made by mixing caramelized sugar with cream. Depending on the intended application, additional ingredients such as butter, fruit purees, liquors, or vanilla can be used. Caramel sauce is used in a range of desserts, especially as a topping for ice cream. When it is used for cr\u00e8me caramel or flan, it is known as clear caramel and only contains caramelized sugar and water. Butterscotch sauce is made with brown sugar, butter, and cream. Traditionally, butterscotch is a hard candy more in line with a toffee.\nCandy.\nCaramel candy, or \"caramels\", and sometimes called \"toffee\" (though this also refers to other types of candy), is a soft, dense, chewy candy made by boiling a mixture of milk or cream, sugar(s), glucose, butter, and vanilla (or vanilla flavoring). The sugar and glucose are combined and heated to reach ; the cream and butter are then added which cools the mixture. The mixture is then stirred and reheated until it reaches . Upon completion of cooking, vanilla or any additional flavorings and salt are added. Adding the vanilla or flavorings earlier would result in them burning off at the high temperatures. Adding salt earlier in the process would result in inverting the sugars as they cooked.\nAlternatively, all ingredients may be cooked together. In this procedure, the mixture is not heated above the firm ball stage (), so that caramelization of the milk occurs. This temperature is not high enough to caramelize sugar and this type of candy is often called milk caramel or cream caramel. Even though caramel candy is sometimes called \"toffee\" and is also compared with butterscotch, there is a difference. While toffee and butterscotch are more closely related than caramel, they do have most of the same ingredients. However, toffee and butterscotch use molasses or brown sugar while caramel uses white sugar. They are also cooked at different temperatures and they each have their own cooking techniques that make them unique in taste and shape.\nSalting.\nAs early as the 19th century, baked products with caramelized sugar and salted dough appeared in certain regional cuisines, notably the kouign-amann in the Brittany region of France where this pairing is strongly apparent. During the early 20th century and following World War II, this pairing was expanded into other types of pastries and cakes.\nSalted caramel sweets with milk or butter were sold in Brittany as early as 1946, reviving recipes already used before World War II. The Quiberon niniche and \"Salidou\u200a\" spread are examples of such products which gained popularity in the late 1940s and 1950s in Brittany. Recipes almost always contained milk or butter which made these products perishable and limited their commercialization.\nIn 1977, French pastry chef Henri Le Roux developed a significantly more stable salted caramel sweet in Quiberon, Brittany, in the form of a salted butter caramel with crushed nuts (\"caramel au beurre sal\u00e9\"), using Breton \"demi-sel\" butter. It was named the \"Best confectionery in France\" (') at the Paris ' in 1980. Le Roux registered the trademark \"CBS\" (\"caramel au beurre sal\u00e9\") the year after.\nSalted caramel sweets became widely popular throughout France and other French-speaking European countries (notably Belgium and Switzerland, which already had a tradition for fine chocolate and confectionery), and for years French, Belgian and Swiss children added it to their , a meal eaten around 4\u00a0pm to restore their energy after school. usually consists of bread with jam or caramel spread, croissants or pain au chocolat, fruit and hot chocolate.\nIn the late 1990s, Parisian pastry chef Pierre Herm\u00e9 introduced his salted butter and caramel macarons, and by 2000, high-end chefs started adding a bit of salt to caramel and chocolate dishes. In 2008 it entered the mass market, when H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Starbucks started selling it.\nOriginally used in desserts, the confection has seen wide use elsewhere, including in hot chocolate and spirits such as vodka. Its popularity may come from its effects on the reward systems of the human brain, resulting in \"hedonic escalation\".\nColouring.\nCaramel colouring, a dark, bitter liquid, is the highly concentrated product of near total caramelization, used commercially as food and beverage colouring, e.g., in cola.\nChemistry.\nCaramelization is the removal of water from a sugar, proceeding to isomerization and polymerization of the sugars into various high-molecular-weight compounds. Compounds such as difructose anhydride may be created from the monosaccharides after water loss. Fragmentation reactions result in low-molecular-weight compounds that may be volatile and may contribute to flavor. Polymerization reactions lead to larger-molecular-weight compounds that contribute to the dark-brown color.\nCaramel can be produced in many forms such as sauce, chewy candy, or hard candy depending on how much of an ingredient is added and the temperature it is being prepared at.\nIn modern recipes and in commercial production, glucose (from corn syrup or wheat) or invert sugar is added to prevent crystallization, making up 10\u201350% of the sugars by mass. \"Wet caramels\" made by heating sucrose and water instead of sucrose alone produce their own invert sugar due to thermal reaction, but not necessarily enough to prevent crystallization in traditional recipes.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This involves drawing each letterform using a consistent style. The basic concepts and design variables are described below.\nA typeface differs from other modes of graphic production such as handwriting and drawing in that it is a fixed set of alphanumeric characters with specific characteristics to be used repetitively. Historically, these were physical elements, called sorts, placed in a wooden frame; modern typefaces are stored and used electronically. It is the art of a type designer to develop a pleasing and functional typeface. In contrast, it is the task of the typographer (or typesetter) to lay out a page using a typeface that is appropriate to the work to be printed or displayed.\nType designers use the basic concepts of strokes, counter, body, and structural groups when designing typefaces. There are also variables\u00a0that type designers take into account when creating typefaces. These design variables are style, weight, contrast, width, posture, and case.\nHistory.\nThe technology of printing text using movable type was invented in China, but the vast number of Chinese characters, and the esteem in which calligraphy was held, meant that few distinctive, complete typefaces were created in China in the early centuries of printing.\nGutenberg's most important innovation in the mid 15th century development of his press was not printing itself, but the casting of Latinate types. Unlike Chinese characters, which are based on a uniform square area, European Latin characters vary in width, from the very wide \"M\" to the slender \"l\". Gutenberg developed an adjustable mold which could accommodate an infinite variety of widths. From then until at least 400 years later, type started with cutting punches, which would be struck into a brass \"matrix\". The matrix was inserted into the bottom of the adjustable mold and the negative space formed by the mold cavity plus the matrix acted as the master for each letter that was cast. The casting material was an alloy usually containing lead, which has a low melting point, cools readily, and can easily be filed and finished. In those early days, type design had to not only imitate the handwritten forms familiar to readers, but also account for the limitations of the printing process, such as rough papers of uneven thicknesses, the squeezing or splashing properties of the ink, and the eventual wear on the type itself.\nBeginning in the 1890s, each character was drawn in a very large size for the American Type Founders Corporation and a few others using their technology\u2014over a foot (30\u00a0cm) high. The outline was then traced by a Benton pantograph-based engraving machine with a pointer at the hand-held vertex and a cutting tool at the opposite vertex down to a size usually less than a quarter-inch (6\u00a0mm). The pantographic engraver was first used to cut punches, and later to directly create matrices.\nIn the late 1960s through the 1980s, typesetting moved from metal to photo composition. During this time, type design made a similar transition from physical matrices to hand-drawn letters on vellum or mylar and then the precise cutting of \"rubyliths\". Rubylith was a common material in the printing trade, in which a very soft, pliable transparent red film was bonded to a supporting clear acetate. Placing the ruby over the master drawing of the letter, the craftsman would gently and precisely cut through the upper film and peel the non-image portions away. The resulting letterform, now existing as the remaining red material still adhering to the clear substrate, would then be ready to be photographed using a reproduction camera.\nWith the coming of computers, type design became a form of computer graphics. Initially, this transition occurred with a program called Ikarus around 1980, but widespread transition began with programs such as Aldus Freehand and Adobe Illustrator, and finally to dedicated type design programs called font editors, such as Fontographer and FontLab. This process occurred rapidly: by the mid-1990s, virtually all commercial type design had transitioned to digital vector drawing programs.\nEach glyph design can be drawn or traced by a stylus on a digitizing board, or modified from a scanned drawing, or composed entirely within the program itself. Each glyph is then in a digital form, either in a bitmap (pixel-based) or vector (scalable outline) format. A given digitization of a typeface can easily be modified by another type designer; such a modified font is usually considered a derivative work, and is covered by the copyright of the original font software.\nType design could be copyrighted typeface by typeface in many countries, though not the United States. The United States offered and continues to offer design patents as an option for typeface design protection.\nBasic concepts.\nStroke.\nThe shape of designed letterforms and other characters are defined by strokes arranged in specific combinations. This shaping and construction has a basis in the gestural movements of handwriting. The visual qualities of a given stroke are derived from factors surrounding its formation: the kind of tool used, the angle at which the tool is dragged across a surface, and the degree of pressure applied from beginning to end. The stroke is the positive form that establishes a character's archetypal shape.\nCounter.\nThe spaces created between and around strokes are called counters (also known as counterforms). These negative forms help to define the proportion, density, and rhythm of letterforms. The counter is an integral element in Western typography, however this concept may not apply universally to non-Western typographic traditions. More complex scripts, such as Chinese, which make use of compounding elements (radicals) within a single character may additionally require consideration of spacing not only between characters but also within characters.\nBody.\nThe overall proportion of characters, or their body, considers proportions of width and height for all cases involved (which in Latin are uppercase and lowercase), and individually for each character. In the former case, a grid system is used to delineate vertical proportions and gridlines (such as the baseline, mean line/x-height, cap line, descent line, and ascent line). In the latter case, letterforms of a typeface may be designed with variable bodies, making the typeface proportional, or they may be designed to fit within a single body measure, making the typeface fixed width or monospaced.\nStructural groups.\nWhen designing letterforms, characters with analogous structures can be grouped in consideration of their shared visual qualities. In Latin, for example, archetypal groups can be made on the basis of the dominant strokes of each letter: verticals and horizontals (E F H L T), diagonals (V W X), verticals and diagonals (K M N Y), horizontals and diagonals (A Z), circular strokes (C O Q S), circular strokes and verticals (B D G P R U), and verticals (I J).\nDesign variables.\nType design takes into consideration a number of design variables which are delineated based on writing system and vary in consideration of functionality, aesthetic quality, cultural expectations, and historical context.\nStyle.\nStyle describes several different aspects of typeface variability historically related to character and function. This includes variations in:\nWeight.\nWeight refers to the thickness or thinness of a typeface's strokes in a global sense. Typefaces usually have a default medium, or regular, weight which will produce the appearance of a uniform grey value when set in text. Categories of weight include hairline, thin, extra light, light, book, regular/medium, semibold, bold, black/heavy, and extra black/ultra.\nVariable fonts are computer fonts that are able to store and make use of a continuous range of weight (and size) variants of a single typeface.\nContrast.\nContrast refers to the variation in weight that may exist internally within each character, between thin strokes and thick strokes. More extreme contrasts will produce texts with more uneven typographic color. At a smaller scale, strokes within a character may individually also exhibit contrasts in weight, which is called modulation.\nWidth.\nEach character within a typeface has its own overall width relative to its height. These proportions may be changed globally so that characters are narrowed or widened. Typefaces that are narrowed are called condensed typefaces, while those that are widened are called extended typefaces.\nPosture.\nLetterform structures may be structured in a way that changes the angle between upright stem structures and the typeface's baseline, changing the overall posture of the typeface. In Latin script typefaces, a typeface is categorized as a Roman when this angle is perpendicular. A forward-leaning angle produces either an Italic, if the letterforms are designed with reanalyzed cursive forms, or an oblique, if the letterforms are slanted mechanically. A back-leaning angle produces a reverse oblique, or backslanted, posture.\nCase.\nA proportion of writing systems are bicameral, distinguishing between two parallel sets of letters that vary in use based on prescribed grammar or convention. These sets of letters are known as cases. The larger case is called uppercase or capitals (also known as majuscule) and the smaller case is called lowercase (also known as minuscule). Typefaces may also include a set of small capitals, which are uppercase forms designed in the same height and weight as lowercase forms. Other writing systems are unicameral, meaning only one case exists for letterforms. Bicameral writing systems may have typefaces with unicase designs, which mix uppercase and lowercase letterforms within a single case.\nPrinciples.\nThe design of a legible text-based typeface remains one of the most challenging assignments in graphic design. The even visual quality of the reading material being of paramount importance, each drawn character (called a glyph) must be even in appearance with every other glyph regardless of order or sequence. Also, if the typeface is to be versatile, it must appear the same whether it is small or large. Because of optical illusions that occur when we apprehend small or large objects, this entails that in the best fonts, a version is designed for small use and another version is drawn for large, display, applications. Also, large letterforms reveal their shape, whereas small letterforms in text settings reveal only their textures: this requires that any typeface that aspires to versatility in both text and display, needs to be evaluated in both of these visual domains. A beautifully shaped typeface may not have a particularly attractive or legible texture when seen in text settings.\nSpacing is also an important part of type design. Each glyph consists not only of the shape of the character, but also the white space around it. The type designer must consider the relationship of the space within a letter form (the counter) and the letter spacing between them.\nDesigning type requires many accommodations for the quirks of human perception, \"optical corrections\" required to make shapes look right, in ways that diverge from what might seem mathematically right. For example, round shapes need to be slightly bigger than square ones to appear \"the same\" size (\"overshoot\"), and vertical lines need to be thicker than horizontal ones to appear the same thickness. For a character to be perceived as geometrically round, it must usually be slightly \"squared\" off (made slightly wider at the shoulders). As a result of all these subtleties, excellence in type design is highly respected in the design professions.\nProfession.\nType design is performed by a type designer. It is a craft, blending elements of art and science. In the pre-digital era it was primarily learned through apprenticeship and professional training within the industry. Since the mid-1990s it has become the subject of dedicated degree programs at a handful of universities, including the MA Typeface Design at the University of Reading (UK) and the Type Media program at the KABK (Royal Academy of Art in the Hague). At the same time, the transition to digital type and font editors which can be inexpensive (or even open source and free) has led to a great democratization of type design; the craft is accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it, nevertheless, it may take a very long time for the serious artist to master.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64088", "revid": "125972", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64088", "title": "Corn syrup", "text": "Syrup made from corn used as food additive\nCorn syrup is a food syrup that is made from the starch of corn/maize and contains varying amounts of sugars: glucose, maltose and higher oligosaccharides, depending on the grade. Corn syrup is used in foods to soften texture, add volume, prevent crystallization of sugar, and enhance flavor. Most table syrups are typically based with corn syrup. It can be processed into high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) by using the enzyme D-xylose isomerase to convert a large proportion of its glucose into sweeter fructose.\nThe more general term glucose syrup is often used synonymously with corn syrup, since glucose syrup in the United States is most commonly made from corn starch. Technically, glucose syrup is any liquid starch hydrolysate of mono-, di-, and higher-saccharides and can be made from any source of starch: wheat, tapioca and potatoes are the most common other sources.\nCommercial preparation.\nHistorically, corn syrup was produced by combining corn starch with dilute hydrochloric acid, and then heating the mixture under pressure. The process was invented by the German chemist Gottlieb Kirchhoff in 1811. Currently, corn syrup is obtained through a multi-step bioprocess. First, the enzyme \u03b1-amylase is added to a mixture of corn starch and water. \u03b1-amylase is secreted by various species of the bacterium genus \"Bacillus\" and is isolated from the liquid in which the bacteria were grown. The enzyme breaks down the starch into oligosaccharides, which are then broken into glucose molecules by adding the enzyme glucoamylase, known also as \"\u03b3-amylase\". Glucoamylase is secreted by various species of the fungus \"Aspergillus\"; the enzyme is isolated from the liquid in which the fungus is grown. The glucose can then be transformed into fructose by passing the glucose through a column that is loaded with the enzyme D-xylose isomerase, an enzyme that is isolated from the growth medium of any of several bacteria.\nCorn syrup is produced from number 2 yellow dent corn. When wet milled, about 2.3 litres of corn are required to yield an average of 947g of starch, to produce 1\u00a0kg of glucose syrup. A bushel (25\u00a0kg) of corn will yield an average of 31.5 pounds (14.3\u00a0kg) of starch, which in turn will yield about 33.3 pounds (15.1\u00a0kg) of syrup. Thus, it takes about 2,300 litres of corn to produce a tonne of glucose syrup, or 60 bushels (1524\u00a0kg) of corn to produce one short ton.\nThe viscosity and sweetness of the syrup depends on the extent to which the hydrolysis reaction has been carried out. To distinguish different grades of syrup, they are rated according to their dextrose equivalent (DE). Most commercially available corn syrups are approximately 1/3 glucose by weight.\nTwo common commercial corn syrup products are light and dark corn syrup.\nUses.\nMajor uses of corn syrup in commercially prepared foods are as a thickener, a sweetener, and a humectant (an ingredient that retains moisture and thus maintains a food's freshness). The primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \"table syrup\" is either regular corn syrup or high-fructose corn syrup, both of which are less expensive than maple syrup.\nIn the United States, tariff-rate quotas for cane sugar imports raise sugar prices; hence, domestically produced corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup are less costly alternatives that are often used in American-made processed and mass-produced foods, candies, soft drinks, and fruit drinks.\nGlucose syrup was the primary corn sweetener in the United States prior to the expanded use of high fructose corn syrup production in 1964. HFCS is a variant in which other enzymes are used to convert some of the glucose into fructose. The resulting syrup is sweeter and more soluble.\nIf mixed with sugar, water, and cream of tartar, corn syrup can be used to make sugar glass.\nHistory.\nCorn syrup was available at grocery stores in the 19th century, as a generic product sold from a barrel. In 1902, the Corn Products Refining Company introduced clear, bottled corn syrup under the brand name of Karo Syrup. In 1910, the company launched one of the largest advertising campaigns ever seen. This included full-page advertisements in women's magazines and free cookbooks full of recipes that called for Karo brand corn syrup. In the 1930s, they promoted a new pecan pie recipe that featured corn syrup, followed by a similar, nut-free chess pie recipe, in a bid to drive sales. Later, they promoted it as an alternative to maple syrup for waffles. As cooking in the home declined in the 21st century, so that fewer people made candies or pies at home, commercial sales of Karo tended to dominate over the retail sales.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Demand for such a typeface was recognized by Virginia Howlett of Microsoft's typography group and commissioned by Steve Ballmer. The name \"Verdana\" is derived from \"\" (green) and \"Ana\" (the name of Howlett's eldest daughter).\nBearing similarities to sans-serif typefaces such as Frutiger, Verdana was designed to be readable at small sizes on the low-resolution computer screens of the period. Like many designs of this type, Verdana has a large x-height (tall lower-case characters), with wider proportions and looser letter-spacing than on print-orientated designs like Helvetica. The counters and apertures are wide, to keep strokes clearly separate from one another, and similarly shaped letters are designed to appear clearly different to increase legibility for body text. The bold weight is thicker than would be normal with fonts for print use, suiting the limitations of onscreen display. Carter has described spacing as an area he particularly worked on during the design process.\nDistinctive visual identifiable characteristics.\nSome characteristics of the typeface are as follows:\nAs an example of the approach of making similar characters easily distinguishable, the digit 1 (one) in Verdana was given a horizontal base and a hook in the upper left to distinguish it from lowercase l (L) and uppercase I (i). This is similar to the digit \"1\" found in Morris Fuller Benton's sans-serif typefaces News Gothic and Franklin Gothic.\nPrevalence.\nReleased in 1996, Verdana was bundled with subsequent versions of the Windows operating system, as well as their Office and Internet Explorer software on Windows, classic Mac OS, and Mac OS X. Since at least Mac OS X 10.4, it is also bundled with the Mac OS itself. In addition, up until 2002 it was available for download from Microsoft's web site as freeware (\".exe\" files for Microsoft Windows and in \".sit.hqx\" archives for Mac OS) under a proprietary license imposing some restrictions on usage and distribution, allowing it to be used by end users in any system supporting installation of \"exe\" or \".sit.hqx\" files and supporting TrueType fonts. The downloadable files are still available legally from third-party web sites; see the External links section. However, these files include only old versions of Verdana, and updated versions are not available as freeware.\nAccording to a 2013 survey, the availability of Verdana was 99.90% on Windows, 99.26% on Mac OS, and 70.02% on free operating systems like Linux.\nAccording to a study of online fonts by the Software Usability and Research Laboratory at Wichita State University, participants preferred Verdana as the best overall font choice, and it was also perceived as being among the most legible fonts. However, Microsoft's font manager, Bill Hill, wrote that \"with its large x-height and very generous spacing, it never felt comfortable as an eBook font\". He noted that Microsoft had commissioned an alternative version of the pre-existing typefaces Berling and Frutiger for its Microsoft Reader e-book product. Despite this, Verdana was initially used as one of the bundled book-reading fonts on the iPad before an update in 2011.\nMicrosoft variants.\nVerdana Ref is a custom version of Verdana for use with Microsoft Reference. It is used in Microsoft Bookshelf 2000, Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 99, Encarta Virtual Globe 99, Office 2000 Premium, and Publisher 2000. MS Reference Sans Serif is a derivative of Verdana Ref with bold and italic fonts. This font family is included with Microsoft Encarta.\nTahoma is similar to Verdana but with tighter letter spacing. The Windows Mobile core font Nina is a more condensed version of Tahoma and Verdana.\nVerdana Pro.\nMicrosoft licensed rights to Verdana to Font Bureau for a new Verdana Pro release, published in 2011. Verdana Pro adds correct German closing quotation marks, light, semi-bold and black styles with italics, as well as condensed styles with italics across all weights. The expanded family was designed for organisations that had made extensive use of Verdana due to its availability but desired additional versions for greater flexibility. It is sold separately through print and web licenses, being sold by Font Bureau and Ascender, although Windows 10 users can acquire it free of charge from Microsoft Store or by activating the Pan-European Supplemental Fonts optional resource on the Settings app. A similar Georgia Pro release was announced at the same time.\nCombining characters bug.\nIn the past, Verdana (v. 2.43) had an incorrect position for combining diacritical marks, causing them to display on the following character instead of the preceding. This made it unsuitable for Unicode-encoded text such as Cyrillic or Greek. This bug did not usually reveal itself with Latin letters. This is because some font display engines substitute sequences of base character + combining character with a precomposed character glyph. This bug was subsequently fixed in the version issued with Windows Vista. It is also fixed in Verdana version 5.01 font on Windows XP by installing the European Union Expansion Font Update from Microsoft.\nAwards.\nIn 2006, the Verdana typeface was named in the list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum. Carter's typeface appeared on a list which included Concorde, Mini, Jaguar E-Type, Aston Martin DB5, Supermarine Spitfire, World Wide Web, London tube map, AEC Routemaster bus and the K2 telephone box.\nUsage.\nIn 2007, the font was used for the questions in \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\", replacing the ITC Conduit font.\nIn 2009, IKEA changed the typeface used in its catalog from Futura to Verdana, expressing a desire to unify its branding between print and web media. The controversy has been attributed to the perception of Verdana as a symbol of homogeneity in popular typography. \"Time\" magazine and the Associated Press ran articles on the controversy including a brief interview with an IKEA representative, focusing on the opinions of typographers and designers. Design and advertising industry-focused publications such as \"Business Week\" joined the fray of online posts. The branding critic blog Brand New was one of those using the Verdanagate name. The Australian online daily news site \"Crikey\" also published an article on the controversy. \"The Guardian\" ran an article asking \"Ikea is changing its font to Verdana\u2014causing outrage among typomaniacs. Should the rest of us care? Absolutely.\" \"The New York Times\" said the change to Verdana \"is so offensive to many because it seems like a slap at the principles of design by a company that has been hailed for its adherence to them.\"\nCarter addressed this controversy during an interview in 2013:\nEver since there was that big ruckus about the IKEA catalog changing from Futura to Verdana, which I had nothing to do with and didn\u2019t even know about, people ask me about that everywhere I go. I give a talk about something historical and then at the end someone will get up and say: \"I started a petition to go back to Futura. You\u2019re a villain!\" You get blamed for something you had nothing to do with.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\nThere's a strange misunderstanding. A friendly guy came up to me at a conference recently and said: I signed that petition to go back to Futura. So I asked: what caused you to do that? And he said, well, Verdana is a screen font. You mustn\u2019t use it in print. So I said: OK, well, so you open the IKEA catalog, it\u2019s set in Verdana, with the big prices and everything\u2026 how do you tell it\u2019s a screen font? What is it about Verdana that says: this is a screen font? He had no idea. He just knew it because he\u2019d been told. There are many people who make judgments without really understanding what the typographic issues are. Students are interesting\u2014they\u2019ll say things to me like: my professor told me I cannot use Verdana and Georgia in print because they\u2019re screen fonts, but I tried it and it looks perfectly all right. And I can only say: Thank you! Go ahead!\nIn 2019, with its logo refresh, IKEA again changed its corporate typeface from Verdana to a customized version of Noto Sans under the name \"Noto IKEA\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Sans-serif typefaces tend to have less stroke width variation than serif typefaces. They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism. For the purposes of type classification, sans-serif designs are usually divided into these major groups: , , , , and .\nSans-serif typefaces have become the most prevalent for display of text on computer screens. On lower-resolution digital displays, fine details like serifs may disappear or appear too large. The term comes from the French word , meaning \"without\" and \"serif\" of uncertain origin, possibly from the Dutch word meaning \"line\" or pen-stroke. In printed media, they are more commonly used for display use and less for body text.\nBefore the term \"sans-serif\" became standard in English typography, a number of other terms had been used. One of these terms for sans-serif was \"grotesque\", often used in Europe, and \"gothic\", which is still used in East Asian typography and sometimes seen in typeface names like News Gothic, Highway Gothic, Franklin Gothic or Trade Gothic.\nSans-serif typefaces are sometimes, especially in older documents, used as a device for emphasis, due to their typically blacker type color.\nClassification.\nFor the purposes of type classification, sans-serif designs are usually divided into three or four major groups, the fourth being the result of splitting the \"grotesque\" category into grotesque and neo-grotesque.\nGrotesque.\nThis group features most of the early (19th century to early 20th) sans-serif designs. Influenced by Didone serif typefaces of the period and sign painting traditions, these were often quite solid, bold designs suitable for headlines and advertisements. The early sans-serif typefaces often did not feature a lower case or italics, since they were not needed for such uses. They were sometimes released by width, with a range of widths from extended to normal to condensed, with each style different, meaning to modern eyes they can look quite irregular and eccentric.\nGrotesque typefaces have limited variation of stroke width (often none perceptible in capitals). The terminals of curves are usually horizontal, and many have a spurred \"G\" and an \"R\" with a curled leg. Capitals tend to be of relatively uniform width. Cap height and ascender height are generally the same to produce a more regular effect in texts such as titles with many capital letters, and descenders are often short for tighter line spacing. They often avoid having a true italic in favor of a more restrained oblique or sloped design, although at least some sans-serif true italics were offered.\nExamples of grotesque typefaces include Akzidenz-Grotesk, Venus, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, IBM Plex and Monotype Grotesque. Akzidenz Grotesk Old Face, Knockout, Grotesque No. 9 and Monotype Grotesque are examples of digital fonts that retain more of the eccentricities of some of the early sans-serif types.\nAccording to Monotype, the term \"grotesque\" originates from , meaning \"belonging to the cave\" due to their simple geometric appearance. The term arose because of adverse comparisons that were drawn with the more ornate Modern Serif and Roman typefaces that were the norm at the time.\nNeo-grotesque.\nNeo-grotesque designs appeared in the mid-twentieth century as an evolution of grotesque types. They are relatively straightforward in appearance with limited stroke width variation. Similar to grotesque typefaces, neo-grotesques often feature capitals of uniform width and a quite 'folded-up' design, in which strokes (for example on the 'c') are curved all the way round to end on a perfect horizontal or vertical. Helvetica is an example of this. Unlike earlier grotesque designs, many were issued in large families from the time of release.\nNeo-grotesque type began in the 1950s with the emergence of the International Typographic Style, or Swiss style. Its members looked at the clear lines of Akzidenz-Grotesk (1898) as an inspiration for designs with a neutral appearance and an even colour on the page. In 1957 the release of Helvetica, Univers, and Folio, the first typefaces categorized as neo-grotesque, had a strong impact internationally: Helvetica came to be the most used typeface for the following decades.\nGeometric.\nGeometric sans-serif typefaces are based on geometric shapes, like near-perfect circles and squares. Common features are a nearly-circular capital 'O', sharp and pointed uppercase 'N' vertices, and a \"single-storey\" lowercase letter 'a'. The 'M' is often splayed and the capitals of varying width, following the classical model.\nThe geometric sans originated in Germany in the 1920s. Two early efforts in designing geometric types were made by Herbert Bayer and Jakob Erbar, who worked respectively on Universal Typeface (unreleased at the time but revived digitally as Architype Bayer) and Erbar (c.\u20091925). In 1927 Futura, by Paul Renner, was released to great acclaim and popularity.\nGeometric sans-serif typefaces were popular from the 1920s and 1930s due to their clean, modern design, and many new geometric designs and revivals have been developed since. Notable geometric types of the period include Kabel, Semplicit\u00e0, Bernhard Gothic, Nobel and Metro; more recent designs in the style include ITC Avant Garde, Brandon Grotesque, Gotham, Avenir, Product Sans, HarmonyOS Sans and Century Gothic. Many geometric sans-serif alphabets of the period, such as those authored by the Bauhaus art school (1919\u20131933) and modernist poster artists, were hand-lettered and not cut into metal type at the time.\nA separate inspiration for many types described \"geometric\" in design has been the simplified shapes of letters engraved or stenciled on metal and plastic in industrial use, which often follow a simplified structure and are sometimes known as \"rectilinear\" for their use of straight vertical and horizontal lines. Designs which have been called geometric in principles but not descended from the Futura, Erbar and Kabel tradition include Bank Gothic, DIN 1451, Eurostile and Handel Gothic, along with many of the typefaces designed by Ray Larabie.\nHumanist.\nHumanist sans-serif typefaces take inspiration from traditional letterforms, such as Roman square capitals, traditional serif typefaces and calligraphy. Many have true italics rather than an oblique, ligatures and even swashes in italic. One of the earliest humanist designs was Edward Johnston's Johnston typeface from 1916, and, a decade later, Gill Sans (Eric Gill, 1928). Edward Johnston, a calligrapher by profession, was inspired by classic letter forms, especially the capital letters on the Column of Trajan.\nHumanist designs vary more than gothic or geometric designs. Some humanist designs have stroke modulation (strokes that clearly vary in width along their line) or alternating thick and thin strokes. These include most popularly Hermann Zapf's Optima (1958), a typeface expressly designed to be suitable for both display and body text. Some humanist designs may be more geometric, as in Gill Sans and Johnston (especially their capitals), which like Roman capitals are often based on perfect squares, half-squares and circles, with considerable variation in width. These somewhat architectural designs may feel too stiff for body text. Others such as Syntax, Goudy Sans and Sassoon Sans more resemble handwriting, serif typefaces or calligraphy.\nFrutiger, from 1976, has been particularly influential in the development of the modern humanist sans genre, especially designs intended to be particularly legible above all other design considerations. The category expanded greatly during the 1980s and 1990s, partly as a reaction against the overwhelming popularity of Helvetica and Univers and also due to the need for legible computer fonts on low-resolution computer displays. Designs from this period intended for print use include FF Meta, Myriad, Thesis, Charlotte Sans, Bliss, Skia and Scala Sans, while designs developed for computer use include Microsoft's Tahoma, Trebuchet, Verdana, Calibri and Corbel, as well as Lucida Grande, Fira Sans and Droid Sans. Humanist sans-serif designs can (if appropriately proportioned and spaced) be particularly suitable for use on screen or at distance, since their designs can be given wide apertures or separation between strokes, which is not a conventional feature on grotesque and neo-grotesque designs.\nOther or mixed.\nDue to the diversity of sans-serif typefaces, many do not exactly fit into the above categories. For example, Neuzeit S has both neo-grotesque and geometric influences, as does Hermann Zapf's URW Grotesk. Whitney blends humanist and grotesque influences, while Klavika is a geometric design not based on the circle. Sans-serif typefaces intended for signage, such as Transport and Tern (both used on road signs), may have unusual features to enhance legibility and differentiate characters, such as a lower-case 'L' with a curl or 'i' with serif under the dot. This is also often seen in typefaces designed for readers with impaired vision like Atkinson Hyperlegible.\nModulated sans-serifs.\nA particular subgenre of sans-serifs is those such as Rothbury, Britannic, Radiant, and National Trust with obvious variation in stroke width. These have been called 'modulated', 'stressed' or 'high-contrast' sans-serifs. They are nowadays often placed within the humanist genre, although they predate Johnston which started the modern humanist genre. These may take inspiration from sources outside printing such as brush lettering or calligraphy. One study looked into the effect of stroke contrast between sans serif and serif typefaces, and although they were limited in testing only one typeface, they found that their modulated sans serif performed better for their low-vision readers compared to the unmodulated sans serif.\nHistory.\nLetters without serifs have been common in writing across history, for example in casual, non-monumental epigraphy of the classical period. However, Roman square capitals, the inspiration for much Latin-alphabet lettering throughout history, had prominent serifs. While simple sans-serif letters have always been common in \"uncultured\" writing and sometimes even in epigraphy, such as basic handwriting, most artistically authored letters in the Latin alphabet, both sculpted and printed, since the Middle Ages have been inspired by fine calligraphy, blackletter writing and Roman square capitals. As a result, printing done in the Latin alphabet for the first three hundred and fifty years of printing was \"serif\" in style, whether in blackletter, roman type, italic or occasionally script.\nThe earliest printing typefaces which omitted serifs were not intended to render contemporary texts, but to represent inscriptions in Ancient Greek and Etruscan. Thus, Thomas Dempster's \"De Etruria regali libri VII\" (1723), used special types intended for the representation of Etruscan epigraphy, and in c.\u20091745, the Caslon foundry made Etruscan types for pamphlets written by Etruscan scholar John Swinton. Another niche used of a printed sans-serif letterform from 1786 onwards was a rounded sans-serif script typeface developed by Valentin Ha\u00fcy for the use of the blind to read with their fingers.\nDeveloping popularity.\nTowards the end of the eighteenth century neoclassicism led to architects increasingly incorporating ancient Greek and Roman designs in contemporary structures. Historian James Mosley, the leading expert on early revival of sans-serif letters, has found that architect John Soane commonly used sans-serif letters on his drawings and architectural designs. Soane's inspiration was apparently the inscriptions dedicating the Temple of Vesta in Tivoli, Italy, with minimal serifs.\nThese were then copied by other artists, and in London sans-serif capitals became popular for advertising, apparently because of the \"astonishing\" effect the unusual style had on the public. The lettering style apparently became referred to as \"old Roman\" or \"Egyptian\" characters, referencing the classical past and a contemporary interest in Ancient Egypt and its blocky, geometric architecture.\nMosley writes that \"in 1805 Egyptian letters were happening in the streets of London, being plastered over shops and on walls by signwriters, and they were astonishing the public, who had never seen letters like them and were not sure they wanted to\". A depiction of the style, as an engraving, rather than printed from type, was shown in the \"European Magazine\" of 1805, described as \"old Roman\" characters. However, the style did not become used in printing for some more years. (Early sans-serif signage was not printed from type but hand-painted or carved, since at the time it was not possible to print in large sizes. This makes tracing the descent of sans-serif styles hard, since a trend can arrive in the dated, printed record from a signpainting tradition which has left less of a record or at least no dates.)\nThe inappropriateness of the name was not lost on the poet Robert Southey, in his satirical \"Letters from England\" written in the character of a Spanish aristocrat. It commented: \"The very shopboards must be... painted in Egyptian letters, which, as the Egyptians had no letters, you will doubtless conceive must be curious. They are simply the common characters, deprived of all beauty and all proportion by having all the strokes of equal thickness, so that those which should be thin look as if they had the elephantiasis.\" Similarly, the painter Joseph Farington wrote in his diary on 13 September 1805 of seeing a memorial engraved \"in what is called \"Egyptian Characters\"\".\nAround 1816, the Ordnance Survey began to use 'Egyptian' lettering, monoline sans-serif capitals, to mark ancient Roman sites. This lettering was printed from copper plate engraving.\nEntry into printing.\nAround 1816, William Caslon IV produced the first sans-serif printing type in England for the Latin alphabet, a capitals-only face under the title 'Two Lines English Egyptian', where 'Two Lines English' referred to the typeface's body size, which equals to about 28 points. Although it is known from its appearances in the firm's specimen books, no uses of it from the period have been found; Mosley speculates that it may have been commissioned by a specific client.\nA second hiatus in interest in sans-serif appears to have lasted for about twelve years, until Vincent Figgins' foundry of London issued a new sans-serif in 1828. David Ryan felt that the design was \"cruder but much larger\" than its predecessor, making it a success. Thereafter sans-serif capitals rapidly began to be issued from London typefounders.\nMuch imitated was the Thorowgood \"grotesque\" face of the early 1830s. This was arrestingly bold and highly condensed, quite unlike the classical proportions of Caslon's design, but very suitable for poster typography and similar in aesthetic effect to the (generally wider) slab serif and \"fat faces\" of the period. It also added a lower-case. The term \"grotesque\" comes from the Italian word for \"cave\", and was often used to describe Roman decorative styles found by excavation, but had long become applied in the modern sense for objects that appeared \"malformed or monstrous\". The term \"grotesque\" became commonly used to describe sans-serifs.\nSimilar condensed sans-serif display typefaces, often capitals-only, became very successful. Sans-serif printing types began to appear thereafter in France and Germany.\nA few theories about early sans-serifs now known to be incorrect may be mentioned here. One is that sans-serifs are based on either \"fat face typefaces\" or slab-serifs with the serifs removed. It is now known that the inspiration was more classical antiquity, and sans-serifs appeared before the first dated appearance of slab-serif letterforms in 1810. The Schelter &amp; Giesecke foundry also claimed during the 1920s to have been offering a sans-serif with lower-case by 1825. Mosley describes this as \"thoroughly discredited\"; as early as 1986 Walter Tracy described the claimed dates as \"on stylistic grounds... about forty years too early\". In 2004, Wolfgang Homola dated the typeface to 1882 based on a study of Schelter &amp; Giesecke specimens.\nSans-serif lettering and typefaces were popular due to their clarity and legibility at distance in advertising and display use, when printed very large or small. Because sans-serif type was often used for headings and commercial printing, many early sans-serif designs did not feature lower-case letters. Simple sans-serif capitals, without use of lower-case, became very common in uses such as tombstones of the Victorian period in Britain.\nThe first use of sans-serif as a running text has been proposed to be the short booklet \"Feste des Lebens und der Kunst: eine Betrachtung des Theaters als h\u00f6chsten Kultursymbols\" (Celebration of Life and Art: A Consideration of the Theater as the Highest Symbol of a Culture), by Peter Behrens, in 1900.\nTwentieth-century sans-serifs.\nThroughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries sans-serif types were viewed with suspicion by many printers, especially those of fine book printing, as being fit only for advertisements (if that), and to this day most books remain printed in serif typefaces as body text. This impression would not have been helped by the standard of common sans-serif types of the period, many of which now seem somewhat lumpy and eccentrically shaped. In 1922, master printer Daniel Berkeley Updike described sans-serif typefaces as having \"no place in any artistically respectable composing-room.\" In 1937 he stated that he saw no need to change this opinion in general, though he felt that Gill Sans and Futura were the best choices if sans-serifs had to be used.\nThrough the early twentieth century, an increase in popularity of sans-serif typefaces took place as more artistic sans-serif designs were released. While he disliked sans-serif typefaces in general, the American printer J. L. Frazier wrote of Copperplate Gothic in 1925 that \"a certain dignity of effect accompanies... due to the absence of anything in the way of frills\", making it a popular choice for the stationery of professionals such as lawyers and doctors. As Updike's comments suggest, the new, more constructed humanist and geometric sans-serif designs were viewed as increasingly respectable, and were shrewdly marketed in Europe and America as embodying classic proportions (with influences of Roman capitals) while presenting a spare, modern image.\nFutura in particular was extensively marketed by Bauer and its American distribution arm by brochure as capturing the spirit of modernity, using the German slogan \"die Schrift unserer Zeit\" (\"the typeface of our time\") and in English \"the typeface of today and tomorrow\"; many typefaces were released under its influence as direct clones, or at least offered with alternate characters allowing them to imitate it if desired.\nGrotesque sans-serif revival and the International Typographic Style.\nIn the post-war period, an increase of interest took place in \"grotesque\" sans-serifs. Writing in \"The Typography of Press Advertisement\" (1956), printer Kenneth Day commented that Stephenson Blake's eccentric Grotesque series had returned to popularity for having \"a personality sometimes lacking in the condensed forms of the contemporary sans cuttings of the last thirty years.\" Leading type designer Adrian Frutiger wrote in 1961 on designing a new face, Univers, on the nineteenth-century model: \"Some of these old sans-serifs have had a real renaissance within the last twenty years, once the reaction of the 'New Objectivity' had been overcome. A purely geometrical form of type is unsustainable.\"\nOf this period in Britain, Mosley has commented that in 1960 \"orders unexpectedly revived\" for Monotype's eccentric Monotype Grotesque design: \"[it] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties\" and \"its rather clumsy design seems to have been one of the chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the... prettiness of Gill Sans\".\nBy the 1960s, neo-grotesque typefaces such as Univers and Helvetica had become popular through reviving the nineteenth-century grotesques while offering a more unified range of styles than on previous designs, allowing a wider range of text to be set artistically through setting headings and body text in a single family. The style of design using asymmetric layouts, Helvetica and a grid layout extensively has been called the Swiss or International Typographic Style.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64100", "revid": "45348484", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64100", "title": "Serif", "text": "Decorative detail in typography\nIn typography, a serif () is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or family of fonts. A typeface or \"font family\" making use of serifs is called a serif typeface (or serifed typeface), and a typeface that does not include them is sans-serif. Some typography sources refer to sans-serif typefaces as \"grotesque\" (in German, ) or \"Gothic\" (although this often refers to blackletter type as well). In German usage, the term Antiqua is used more broadly for serif types.\nSerif typefaces can be broadly classified into one of four subgroups: Old-style, Transitional, Didone, and Slab serif, in order of first emergence.\nOrigins and etymology.\nSerifs originated from the first official Greek writings on stone and in Latin alphabet with inscriptional lettering\u2014words carved into stone in Roman antiquity. The explanation proposed by Father Edward Catich in his 1968 book \"The Origin of the Serif\" is now broadly but not universally accepted: the Roman letter outlines were first painted onto stone, and the stone carvers followed the brush marks, which flared at stroke ends and corners, creating serifs. Another theory is that serifs were devised to neaten the ends of lines as they were chiselled into stone.\nThe origin of the word 'serif' is obscure, but apparently is almost as recent as the type style. The book \"The British Standard of the Capital Letters Contained in the Roman Alphabet, Forming a Complete Code of Systematic Rules for a Mathematical Construction and Accurate Formation of the Same, with Letters of Exemplification, Elementary and Compleat: Together with an Useful and Practical Appendix\" by William Hollins (1813), defined 'surripses', usually pronounced \"surriphs\", as \"projections which appear at the tops and bottoms of some letters, the O and Q excepted, at the beginning or end, and sometimes at each, of all\". The standard also proposed that 'surripsis' may be a Greek word derived from (, \"together\") and (, \"projection\").\nIn 1827, Greek scholar Julian Hibbert printed with his own experimental uncial Greek types, remarking that the types of Giambattista Bodoni's \"Callimachus\" were \"ornamented (or rather disfigured) by additions of what [he] believe[s] type-founders call syrifs or cerefs\". The printer Thomas Curson Hansard referred to them as \"ceriphs\" in 1825. The oldest citations in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (\"OED\") are 1830 for 'serif' and 1841 for 'sans serif'. The \"OED\" speculates that 'serif' was a back-formation from 'sanserif'.\n\"Webster's Third New International Dictionary\" traces 'serif' to the Dutch noun , meaning \"line, stroke of the pen\", related to the verb , \"to delete, strike through\" ( now also means \"serif\" in Dutch). Yet, is the past tense of (to write). The relation between and is documented by Van Veen and Van der Sijs. In her book , Van der Sijs lists words by first known publication in the language area that is the Netherlands today:\nThe \"OED\"'s earliest citation for \"grotesque\" in this sense is 1875, giving 'stone-letter' as a synonym. It would seem to mean \"out of the ordinary\" in this usage, as in art 'grotesque' usually means \"elaborately decorated\". Other synonyms include \"Doric\" and \"Gothic\", commonly used for Japanese Gothic typefaces.\nClassification.\nOld-style.\nOld-style typefaces date back to 1465, shortly after Johannes Gutenberg's adoption of the movable type printing press. Early printers in Italy created types that broke with Gutenberg's blackletter printing, creating upright (\"roman\") and then oblique (\"italic\") styles that were inspired by Renaissance calligraphy. Old-style serif fonts have remained popular for setting body text because of their organic appearance and excellent readability on rough book paper. The increasing interest in early printing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a return to the designs of Renaissance printers and type-founders, many of whose names and designs are still used today.\nOld-style type is characterized by a lack of large differences between thick and thin lines (low line contrast) and generally, but less often, by a diagonal stress (the thinnest parts of letters are at an angle rather than at the top and bottom). An old-style font normally has a left-inclining curve axis with weight stress at about 8 and 2 o'clock; serifs are almost always bracketed (they have curves connecting the serif to the stroke); head serifs are often angled.\nOld-style faces evolved over time, showing increasing abstraction from what would now be considered handwriting and blackletter characteristics, and often increased delicacy or contrast as printing technique improved. Old-style faces have often sub-divided into 'Venetian' (or 'humanist') and 'Garalde' (or 'Aldine'), a division made on the Vox-ATypI classification system. Nonetheless, some have argued that the difference is excessively abstract, hard to spot except to specialists and implies a clearer separation between styles than originally appeared. Modern typefaces such as Arno and Trinit\u00e9 may fuse both styles.\nEarly \"humanist\" roman types were introduced in Italy. Modelled on the script of the period, they tend to feature an \"e\" in which the cross stroke is angled, not horizontal; an \"M\" with two-way serifs; and often a relatively dark colour on the page. In modern times, that of Nicolas Jenson has been the most admired, with many revivals. Garaldes, which tend to feature a level cross-stroke on the \"e\", descend from an influential 1495 font cut by engraver Francesco Griffo for printer Aldus Manutius, which became the inspiration for many typefaces cut in France from the 1530s onwards. Often lighter on the page and made in larger sizes than had been used for roman type before, French Garalde faces rapidly spread throughout Europe from the 1530s to become an international standard.\nAlso during this period, italic type evolved from a quite separate genre of type, intended for informal uses such as poetry, into taking a secondary role for emphasis. Italics moved from being conceived as separate designs and proportions to being able to be fitted into the same line as roman type with a design complementary to it.\nExamples of contemporary Garalde old-style typefaces are Bembo, Garamond, Galliard, Granjon, Goudy Old Style, Minion, Palatino, Renard, Sabon, and Scala. Contemporary typefaces with Venetian old style characteristics include Cloister, Adobe Jenson, the Golden Type, Hightower Text, Centaur, Goudy's Italian Old Style and Berkeley Old Style and ITC Legacy. Several of these blend in Garalde influences to fit modern expectations, especially placing single-sided serifs on the \"M\"; Cloister is an exception.\nDutch taste.\nA new genre of serif type developed around the 17th century in the Netherlands and Germany that came to be called the \"Dutch taste\" ( in French). It was a tendency towards denser, more solid typefaces, often with a high x-height (tall lower-case letters) and a sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes, perhaps influenced by blackletter faces.\nArtists in the \"Dutch taste\" style include Hendrik van den Keere, Nicolaas Briot, Christoffel van Dijck, Mikl\u00f3s T\u00f3tfalusi Kis and the Janson and Ehrhardt types based on his work and Caslon, especially the larger sizes.\nTransitional.\nTransitional, or baroque, serif typefaces first became common around the mid-18th century until the start of the 19th. They are in between \"old style\" and \"modern\" fonts, thus the name \"transitional\". Differences between thick and thin lines are more pronounced than they are in old style, but less dramatic than they are in the Didone fonts that followed. Stress is more likely to be vertical, and often the \"R\" has a curled tail. The ends of many strokes are marked not by blunt or angled serifs but by ball terminals. Transitional faces often have an italic 'h' that opens outwards at bottom right. Because the genre bridges styles, it is difficult to define where the genre starts and ends. Many of the most popular transitional designs are later creations in the same style.\nFonts from the original period of transitional typefaces include early on the in France, then the work of Pierre Simon Fournier in France, Fleischman and Rosart in the Low Countries, Pradell in Spain and John Baskerville and Bulmer in England. Among more recent designs, Times New Roman (1932), Noto Serif, Perpetua, Plantin, Mrs. Eaves, Freight Text, and the earlier \"modernised old styles\" have been described as transitional in design.\nLater 18th-century transitional typefaces in Britain begin to show influences of Didone typefaces from Europe, described below, and the two genres blur, especially in type intended for body text; Bell is an example of this.\nDidone.\nDidone, or modern, serif typefaces, which first emerged in the late 18th century, are characterized by extreme contrast between thick and thin lines. These typefaces have a vertical stress and thin serifs with a constant width, with minimal bracketing (constant width). Serifs tend to be very thin, and vertical lines very heavy. Didone fonts are often considered to be less readable than transitional or old-style serif typefaces. Period examples include Bodoni, Didot, and Walbaum. Computer Modern is a popular contemporary example. The very popular Century is a softened version of the same basic design, with reduced contrast. Didone typefaces achieved dominance of printing in the early 19th-century printing before declining in popularity in the second half of the century and especially in the 20th as new designs and revivals of old-style faces emerged.\nIn print, Didone fonts are often used on high-gloss magazine paper for magazines such as \"Harper's Bazaar\", where the paper retains the detail of their high contrast well, and for whose image a crisp, \"European\" design of type may be considered appropriate. They are used more often for general-purpose body text, such as book printing, in Europe. They remain popular in the printing of Greek, as the Didot family were among the first to establish a printing press in newly independent Greece. The period of Didone types' greatest popularity coincided with the rapid spread of printed posters and commercial ephemera and the arrival of bold type. As a result, many Didone typefaces are among the earliest designed for \"display\" use, with an ultra-bold \"fat face\" style becoming a common sub-genre.\nSlab serif.\nSlab serif typefaces date to about 1817.&lt;ref name=\"Three chapters in the development of clarendon/ionic typefaces\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended as attention-grabbing designs for posters, they have very thick serifs, which tend to be as thick as the vertical lines themselves. Slab serif fonts vary considerably: some, such as Rockwell, have a geometric design with minimal variation in stroke width\u2014they are sometimes described as sans-serif fonts with added serifs. Others, such as those of the \"Clarendon\" model, have a structure more like most other serif fonts, though with larger and more obvious serifs. These designs may have bracketed serifs that increase width along their length.\nBecause of the clear, bold nature of the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used for posters and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all characters occupy the same amount of horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended for newspaper use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.\nExamples of slab-serif typefaces include Clarendon, Rockwell, Archer, Courier, Excelsior, TheSerif, and Zilla Slab. FF Meta Serif and Guardian Egyptian are examples of newspaper and small print-oriented typefaces with some slab-serif characteristics, often most visible in the bold weights. In the late 20th century, the term \"humanist slab-serif\" has been applied to typefaces such as Chaparral, Caecilia and Tisa, with strong serifs but an outline structure with some influence of old-style serif typefaces.\nOther styles.\nDuring the 19th century, genres of serif type besides conventional body text faces proliferated. These included \"Tuscan\" faces, with ornamental, decorative ends to the strokes rather than serifs, and \"Latin\" or \"wedge-serif\" faces, with pointed serifs, which were particularly popular in France and other parts of Europe including for signage applications such as business cards or shop fronts.\nWell-known typefaces in the \"Latin\" style include Wide Latin, Copperplate Gothic, Johnston Delf Smith and the more restrained M\u00e9ridien.\nReadability and legibility.\nSerifed typefaces are widely used for body text because they are considered easier to read than sans-serif typefaces in print. Colin Wheildon, who conducted scientific studies from 1982 to 1990, found that sans-serif typefaces created various difficulties for readers that impaired their comprehension. According to Kathleen Tinkel, studies suggest that \"most sans serif typefaces may be slightly less legible than most serif faces, but\u00a0... the difference can be offset by careful setting\".\nSans-serif fonts are considered to be more legible on computer screens. According to Alex Poole, \"we should accept that most reasonably designed typefaces in mainstream use will be equally legible\". A study suggested that serif typefaces are more legible on a screen but are not generally preferred to sans-serif typefaces. Another study indicated that comprehension times for individual words are slightly faster when written in a sans-serif typeface versus a serif typeface.\nWhen size of an individual glyph is 9\u201320 pixels, proportional serifs and some lines of most glyphs of common vector typefaces are smaller than individual pixels. Hinting, spatial anti-aliasing, and subpixel rendering allow systems to render distinguishable serifs even in this case, but their proportions and appearances are off, and their thicknesses are close to many lines of the main glyph, strongly altering appearance of the glyph. Consequently, it is sometimes advised to use sans-serif typefaces for content meant to be displayed on screens, as they scale better for low resolutions. Indeed, most web pages employ sans-serif type. The introduction of desktop displays with 300+ dpi resolution may eventually make this recommendation obsolete.\nAs serifs originated in inscription, they are generally not used in handwriting. A common exception is the printed capital I, where the addition of serifs distinguishes the character from lowercase L (l). The printed capital J and the numeral 1 are also often handwritten with serifs.\nGallery.\nBelow are some images of serif letterforms across history:\nAnalogues in other writing systems.\nEast Asia.\nIn the Chinese and Japanese writing systems, there are common type styles based on the regular script for Chinese characters akin to serif and sans serif fonts in the West. In Mainland China, the most popular category of serifed-like typefaces for body text is called Song (, ); in Japan, the most popular serif style is called ; and in Taiwan and Hong Kong, it is called (, ). The names of these lettering styles come from the Song and Ming dynasties, when block printing flourished in China. Because the wood grain on printing blocks ran horizontally, it was fairly easy to carve horizontal lines with the grain. However, carving vertical or slanted patterns was difficult because those patterns intersect with the grain and break easily. This resulted in a typeface that has thin horizontal strokes and thick vertical strokes. In accordance with Chinese calligraphy (kaiti style in particular), where each horizontal stroke is ended with a dipping motion of the brush, the ending of horizontal strokes are also thickened. These design forces resulted in the current Song typeface characterized by thick vertical strokes contrasted with thin horizontal strokes, triangular ornaments at the end of single horizontal strokes, and overall geometrical regularity.\nIn Japanese typography, the equivalent of serifs on kanji and kana characters are called \u2014\"fish scales\". In Chinese, the serifs are called either (, lit. \"forms with legs\") or (, lit. \"forms with ornamental lines\").\nThe other common East Asian style of type is called black (, ) in Chinese and in Japanese. This group is characterized by lines of even thickness for each stroke, the equivalent of \"sans serif\". This style, first introduced on newspaper headlines, is commonly used on headings, websites, signs and billboards. A Japanese-language font designed in imitation of western serifs also exists.\nThai.\nFarang Ses, designed in 1913, was the first Thai typeface to employ thick and thin strokes reflecting old-style serif Latin typefaces, and became extremely popular, with its derivatives widely used into the digital age. (Examples: Angsana UPC, Kinnari)\nCompared to blackletter.\nIn Germany and other Central European countries, blackletter remained the norm in body text for longer than in Western Europe; see the Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute, often dividing along ideological or political lines. After the mid-20th century, Fraktur fell out of favor and Antiqua-based typefaces became the official standard in Germany. (In German, the term \"Antiqua\" refers to serif typefaces.)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most typefaces include variations in size (e.g., 24 point), weight (e.g., light, bold), slope (e.g., italic), width (e.g., condensed), and so on. Each of these variations of the typeface is a font.\nThere are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly.\nThe art and craft of designing typefaces is called type design. Designers of typefaces are called type designers and are often employed by type foundries. In desktop publishing, type designers are sometimes also called \"font developers\" or \"font designers\" (a typographer is someone who \"uses\" typefaces to design a page layout).\nEvery typeface is a collection of glyphs, each of which represents an individual letter, number, punctuation mark, or other symbol. The same glyph may be used for characters from different writing systems, e.g. Roman uppercase A looks the same as Cyrillic uppercase \u0410 and Greek uppercase alpha (\u0391). There are typefaces tailored for special applications, such as cartography, astrology or mathematics.\nTerminology.\nIn professional typography, the term \"typeface\" is not interchangeable with the word \"font,\" because the term font has historically been defined as a given alphabet and its associated characters in a single size. For example, 8-point Caslon Italic was one font, and 10-point Caslon Italic was another. Historically, a font came from a type foundry as a set of \"sorts\", with number of copies of each character included.\nAs the range of typeface designs increased and requirements of publishers broadened over the centuries, fonts of specific weight (blackness or lightness) and stylistic variants (most commonly \"regular\" or \"roman\" as distinct from \"italic\", as well as \"condensed\") have led to \"font families\", collections of closely related typeface designs that can include hundreds of styles. A typeface family is typically a group of related typefaces which vary only in weight, orientation, width, etc., but not design. For example, Times is a typeface family, whereas Times Roman, Times Italic and Times Bold are individual typefaces making up the Times family. Typeface families typically include several typefaces, though some, such as Helvetica, may consist of dozens of fonts. In traditional typography, a font family is a set of fonts within the same typeface: for example Times Roman 8, Times Roman 10, Times Roman 12 etc. In web typography, the term 'font family' (as specified using the HTML code ) may equate to a 'typeface family' or even to a very broad category such as sans-serif that encompass many typeface families.\nAnother way to look at the distinction between a computer font and a typeface is that a computer font is the vessel (e.g. the software) that provides a set of characters with a given appearance, whereas a typeface is the actual design of such characters. Therefore, a given typeface, such as Times, may be rendered by different fonts, such as computer font files created by this or that vendor, a set of metal type characters etc. In the metal type era, a font also meant a specific point size, but with digital scalable outline fonts this distinction is no longer valid, as a single font may be scaled to any size.\nThe first \"extended\" font families, which included a wide range of widths and weights in the same general style emerged in the early 1900s, starting with ATF's Cheltenham (1902\u20131913), with an initial design by Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue, and many additional faces designed by Morris Fuller Benton. Later examples include Futura, Lucida, ITC Officina. Some became superfamilies as a result of revival, such as Linotype Syntax, Linotype Univers; while others have alternate styling designed as compatible replacements of each other, such as Compatil, Generis.\nFont \"superfamilies\" began to emerge when foundries began to include typefaces with significant structural differences, but some design relationship, under the same general family name. Arguably the first superfamily was created when Morris Fuller Benton created Clearface Gothic for ATF in 1910, a sans serif companion to the existing (serifed) Clearface. From a typographer\u2019s perspective, the \"superfamily\" designation does not include sets of unrelated typefaces marketed with the same or similar family names. For example, the foundries that market Caslon Antique and Futura Black and Display named them in association with the Caslon and Futura families despite being structurally unrelated to those families. Consequently, typographers do not consider Caslon Antique and Futura Black/Display to be valid members of any Caslon or Futura 'superfamily'.\nAdditional or supplemental glyphs intended to match a main typeface have been in use for centuries. In some formats they have been marketed as separate fonts. In the early 1990s, the Adobe Systems type group introduced the idea of \"expert set\" fonts, which had a standardized set of additional glyphs, including small caps, old style figures, and additional superior letters, fractions and ligatures not found in the main fonts for the typeface. Supplemental fonts have also included alternate letters such as swashes, dingbats, and alternate character sets, complementing the regular fonts under the same family. However, with introduction of font formats such as OpenType, those supplemental glyphs were merged into the main fonts, relying on specific software capabilities to access the alternate glyphs.\nSince Apple's and Microsoft's operating systems supported different character sets in the platform related fonts, some foundries used expert fonts in a different way. These fonts included the characters which were missing on either Macintosh or Windows computers, e.g. fractions, ligatures or some accented glyphs. The goal was to deliver the whole character set to the customer regardless of which operating system was used.\nSizing.\nThe size of typefaces and fonts is traditionally measured in points; \"point\" has been defined differently at different times, but now the most popular is the Desktop Publishing point of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204472\u00a0in (). When specified in typographic sizes (points, kyus), the height of an \"em-square\", an invisible box which is typically a bit larger than the distance from the tallest ascender to the lowest descender, is scaled to equal the specified size. For example, when setting Helvetica at 12 point, the em square defined in the Helvetica font is scaled to 12 points or . Yet no particular element of 12-point Helvetica need measure exactly 12 points.\nFrequently measurement in non-typographic units (feet, inches, meters) will be of the \"cap-height\", the height of the capital letters. Font size is also commonly measured in millimeters (mm) and \"q\"s (a quarter of a millimeter, \"kyu\" in romanized Japanese) and inches.\nHistory.\nType foundries have cast fonts in lead alloys from the 1450s until the present, although wood served as the material for some large fonts called wood type during the 19th century, particularly in the United States. In the 1890s, the mechanization of typesetting allowed automated casting of fonts on the fly as lines of type in the size and length needed. This was known as continuous casting, and remained profitable and widespread until its demise in the 1970s. The first machine of this type was the Linotype machine, invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler.\nDuring a brief transitional period (c.\u20091950s\u20131990s), photographic technology, known as \"phototypesetting\", utilized tiny high-resolution images of individual glyphs on a film strip (in the form of a film negative, with the letters as clear areas on an opaque black background). A high-intensity light source behind the film strip projected the image of each glyph through an optical system, which focused the desired letter onto the light-sensitive phototypesetting paper at a specific size and position. This photographic typesetting process permitted optical scaling, allowing designers to produce multiple sizes from a single font, although physical constraints on the reproduction system used still required design changes at different sizes; for example, ink traps and spikes to allow for spread of ink encountered in the printing stage. Manually operated photocomposition systems using fonts on filmstrips allowed fine kerning between letters without the physical effort of manual typesetting, and spawned an enlarged type design industry in the 1960s and 1970s.\nBy the mid-1970s, all of the major typeface technologies and all their fonts were in use: letterpress; continuous casting machines; phototypositors; computer-controlled phototypesetters; and the earliest digital typesetters \u2013 bulky machines with primitive processors and CRT outputs. From the mid-1980s, as digital typography has grown, users have almost universally adopted the American spelling \"font\", which has come to primarily refer to a computer file containing scalable outline letterforms (\"digital font\"), in one of several common formats. Some typefaces, such as Verdana, are designed primarily for use on computer screens.\nDigital type.\nDigital type became the dominant form of type in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Digital fonts store the image of each character either as a bitmap in a \"bitmap font\", or by mathematical description of lines and curves in an \"outline font\", also called a \"vector font\". Bitmap fonts were more commonly used in the earlier stages of digital type, and are rarely used today. These bitmapped typefaces were first produced by Casady &amp; Greene, Inc. and were also known as Fluent Fonts. Fluent Fonts became mostly obsolete with the creation of downloadable PostScript fonts, and these new fonts are called Fluent Laser Fonts (FLF).\nWhen an outline font is used, a rasterizing routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions to decide which pixels should be black and which ones white. Rasterization is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel can mean the difference between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.\nDigital fonts may also contain data representing the \"metrics\" used for composition, including kerning pairs, component creation data for accented characters, glyph substitution rules for Arabic typography and for connecting script faces, and for simple everyday ligatures like \"\ufb02\". Common font formats include TrueType, OpenType and PostScript Type 1, while Metafont is still used by TeX and its variants. Applications using these font formats, including the rasterizers, appear in Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems, Adobe Systems products and those of several other companies. Digital fonts are created with font editors such as FontForge, RoboFont, Glyphs, Fontlab's TypeTool, FontLab Studio, Fontographer, or AsiaFont Studio.\nTypeface anatomy.\nTypographers have developed a comprehensive vocabulary for describing the many aspects of typefaces and typography. Some vocabulary applies only to a subset of all scripts. \"Serifs\", for example, are a purely decorative characteristic of typefaces used for European scripts, whereas the glyphs used in Arabic or East Asian scripts have characteristics (such as stroke width) that may be similar in some respects but cannot reasonably be called serifs and may not be purely decorative.\nSerifs.\nTypefaces can be divided into two main categories: serif and sans serif. Serifs comprise the small features at the end of strokes within letters. The printing industry refers to typeface without serifs as sans serif (from French \"sans\", meaning \"without\"), or as \"grotesque\" (or, in German, \"grotesk\").\nGreat variety exists among both serif and sans serif typefaces. Both groups contain faces designed for setting large amounts of body text, and others intended primarily as decorative. The presence or absence of serifs represents only one of many factors to consider when choosing a typeface.\nTypefaces with serifs are often considered easier to read in long passages than those without. Studies on the matter are ambiguous, suggesting that most of this effect is due to the greater familiarity of serif typefaces. As a general rule, printed works such as newspapers and books almost always use serif typefaces, at least for the text body. Websites do not have to specify a font and can simply respect the browser settings of the user. But of those web sites that do specify a font, most use modern sans serif fonts, because it is commonly believed that, in contrast to the case for printed material, sans serif fonts are easier than serif fonts to read on the low-resolution computer screen.\nProportion.\nA proportional typeface, also called variable-width typeface, contains glyphs of varying widths, while a monospaced (non-proportional or fixed-width) typeface uses a single standard width for all glyphs in the font. Duospaced fonts are similar to monospaced fonts, but characters can also be two character widths instead of a single character width.\nMany people generally find proportional typefaces nicer-looking and easier to read, and thus they appear more commonly in professionally published printed material. For the same reason, GUI computer applications (such as word processors and web browsers) typically use proportional fonts. However, many proportional fonts contain fixed-width (tabular) numerals so that columns of numbers stay aligned.\nMonospaced typefaces function better for some purposes because their glyphs line up in neat, regular columns. No glyph is given any more weight than another. Most manually operated typewriters use monospaced fonts, and a typeface that looks like it was typewritten is sometimes referred to as a \"typescript\". So do text-only computer displays and third- and fourth-generation game console graphics processors, which treat the screen as a uniform grid of character cells. Most computer programs which have a text-based interface (terminal emulators, for example) use only monospaced fonts (or add additional spacing to proportional fonts to fit them in monospaced cells) in their configuration. Monospaced fonts are commonly used by computer programmers for displaying and editing source code so that certain characters (for example parentheses used to group arithmetic expressions) are easy to see.\nASCII art usually requires a monospaced font for proper viewing, with the exception of Shift JIS art which takes advantage of the proportional characters in the MS PGothic font. In a web page, the codice_1, codice_2&lt;/code&gt; or codice_3 HTML tags most commonly specify monospaced fonts. In LaTeX, the \"verbatim\" environment or the Teletype font family (e.g., codice_4 or codice_5) uses monospaced fonts (in TeX, use codice_6).\nAny two lines of text with the same number of characters in each line in a monospaced typeface should display as equal in width, while the same two lines in a proportional typeface may have radically different widths. This occurs because in a proportional font, glyph widths vary, such that wider glyphs (typically those for characters such as W, Q, Z, M, D, O, H, and U) use more space, and narrower glyphs (such as those for the characters i, t, l, and 1) use less space than the average.\nIn the publishing industry, it was once the case that editors read manuscripts in monospaced fonts (typically Courier) for ease of editing and word count estimates, and it was considered discourteous to submit a manuscript in a proportional font. This has become less universal in recent years, such that authors need to check with editors as to their preference, though monospaced fonts are still the norm.\nFont metrics.\nMost scripts share the notion of a baseline: an imaginary horizontal line on which characters rest. In some scripts, parts of glyphs lie below the baseline. The \"descent\" spans the distance between the baseline and the lowest descending glyph in a typeface, and the part of a glyph that descends below the baseline has the name \"descender\". Conversely, the \"ascent\" spans the distance between the baseline and the top of the glyph that reaches farthest from the baseline. The ascent and descent may or may not include distance added by accents or diacritical marks.\nIn the Latin, Greek and Cyrillic (sometimes collectively referred to as LGC) scripts, one can refer to the distance from the baseline to the top of regular lowercase glyphs (mean line) as the \"x-height\", and the part of a glyph rising above the x-height as the \"ascender\". The distance from the baseline to the top of the ascent or a regular uppercase glyphs (cap line) is also known as the cap height. The height of the ascender can have a dramatic effect on the readability and appearance of a font. The ratio between the x-height and the ascent or cap height often serves to characterize typefaces.\nTypefaces that can be substituted for one another in a document without changing the document's text flow are said to be \"metrically identical\" (or \"metrically compatible\"). Several typefaces have been created to be metrically compatible with widely used proprietary typefaces to allow the editing of documents set in such typefaces in digital typesetting environments where these typefaces are not available. For instance, the free and open-source Liberation fonts and Croscore fonts have been designed as metrically compatible substitutes for widely used Microsoft fonts.\nOptical sizing.\nDuring the metal type era, all type was cut in metal and could only be printed at a specific size. It was a natural process to vary a design at different sizes, making it chunkier and clearer to read at smaller sizes. Many digital typefaces are offered with a range of fonts (or a variable font axis) for different sizes, especially designs sold for professional design use. The art of designing fonts for a specific size is known as optical sizing. Others will be offered in only one style, but optimised for a specific size. Optical sizes are particularly common for serif fonts, since the fine detail of serif fonts can need to be bulked up for smaller sizes.\nTypefaces may also be designed differently considering the type of paper on which they will be printed. Designs to be printed on absorbent newsprint paper will be more slender as the ink will naturally spread out as it absorbs into the paper, and may feature ink traps: areas left blank into which the ink will soak as it dries. These corrections will not be needed for printing on high-gloss cardboard or display on-screen. Fonts designed for low-resolution displays, meanwhile, may avoid pure circles, fine lines and details a screen cannot render.\nTypesetting numbers.\nMost typefaces, especially modern designs, include a complementary set of numeric digits.\nNumbers can be typeset in two main independent sets of ways: \"lining\" and \"non-lining figures\", and \"proportional\" and \"tabular\" styles.\nMost modern typefaces set numeric digits by default as lining figures, which are the height of upper-case letters. Non-lining figures, styled to match lower-case letters, are often common in fonts intended for body text, as they are thought to be less disruptive to the style of running text. They are also called \"lower-case numbers\" or \"text figures\" for the same reason.\nTabular figures.\nThe horizontal spacing of digits can also be \"proportional\", with a character width tightly matching the width of the figure itself, or \"tabular\", where all digits have the same width. Proportional spacing places the digits closely together, reducing empty space in a document, and is thought to allow the numbers to blend into the text more effectively. As tabular spacing makes all numbers with the same number of digits the same width, it is used for typesetting documents such as price lists, stock listings and sums in mathematics textbooks, all of which require columns of numeric figures to line up on top of each other for easier comparison. Tabular spacing is also a common feature of simple printing devices such as cash registers and date-stamps.\nCharacters of uniform width are a standard feature of so-called monospaced fonts, used in programming and on typewriters. However, many fonts that are not monospaced use tabular figures. More complex font designs may include two or more combinations with one as the default and others as alternate characters. Of the four possibilities, non-lining tabular figures are particularly rare since there is no common use for them.\nFonts intended for professional use in documents such as business reports may also make the bold-style tabular figures take up the same width as the regular (non-bold) numbers, so a bold-style total would appear just as wide as the same sum in regular style.\nStyle of typefaces.\nBecause an abundance of typefaces has been created over the centuries, they are commonly categorized according to their appearance. At the highest level (in the context of Latin-script fonts), one can differentiate Roman, Blackletter, and Gaelic types. Roman types are in the most widespread use today, and are sub-classified as serif, sans serif, ornamental, and script types. Historically, the first European fonts were blackletter, followed by Roman serif, then sans serif and then the other types. The use of Gaelic faces was restricted to the Irish language, though these form a unique if minority class. Typefaces may be monospaced regardless of whether they are Roman, Blackletter, or Gaelic. Symbol typefaces are non-alphabetic. The Cyrillic script comes in two varieties, Roman-appearance type (called \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 \"gra\u017edanskij \u0161rift\") and traditional Slavonic type (called \u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u0440\u0438\u0444\u0442 \"slavjanskij \u0161rift\").\nRoman typefaces.\nSerif typefaces.\nSerif, or \"Roman\", typefaces are named for the features at the ends of their strokes. Times New Roman and Garamond are common examples of serif typefaces. Serif fonts are probably the most used class in printed materials, including most books, newspapers and magazines. Serif fonts are often classified into three subcategories: Old Style, Transitional, and Didone (or Modern), representative examples of which are Garamond, Baskerville, and Bodoni respectively.\nOld Style typefaces are influenced by early Italian lettering design. Modern fonts often exhibit a bracketed serif and a substantial difference in weight within the strokes. Though some argument exists as to whether Transitional fonts exist as a discrete category among serif fonts, Transitional fonts lie somewhere between Old Style and Modern style typefaces. Transitional fonts exhibit a marked increase in the variation of stroke weight and a more horizontal serif compared to Old Style. Slab serif designs have particularly large serifs, and date to the early nineteenth century. The earliest known slab serif font was first shown around 1817 by the English typefounder Vincent Figgins.\n\"Roman\", \"italic\", and \"oblique\" are also terms used to differentiate between upright and two possible slanted forms of a typeface. Italic and oblique fonts are similar (indeed, oblique fonts are often simply called italics) but there is strictly a difference: \"italic\" applies to fonts where the letter forms are redesigned, not just slanted. Almost all serif faces have italic forms; some sans-serif faces have oblique designs. (Most faces do not offer both as this is an artistic choice by the font designer about how the slanted form should look.)\nSans-serif typefaces.\nSans serif (lit. without serif) designs appeared relatively recently in the history of type design. The first, similar to slab serif designs, was shown in 1816 by William Caslon IV. Many have minimal variation in stroke width, creating the impression of a minimal, simplified design. When first introduced, the faces were disparaged as \"grotesque\" (or \"grotesk\") and \"gothic\": but by the late nineteenth century were commonly used for san-serif without negative implication.\nThe major sub-classes of Sans-serif are \"Grotesque\", \"Neo-grotesque\", \"Geometric\" and \"Humanist\".\nBlackletter typefaces.\n\"Blackletter\" is the name of the class of typefaces used with the earliest printing presses in Europe, which imitated the calligraphy style of that time and place. Various forms exist including textualis, rotunda, schwabacher and fraktur. (Some people refer to Blackletter as \"gothic script\" or \"gothic font\", though the term \"Gothic\" in typography refers to sans serif typefaces.)\nGaelic typefaces.\nGaelic fonts were first used for the Irish language in 1571, and were used regularly for Irish until the early 1960s, though they continue to be used in display type and type for signage. Their use was effectively confined to Ireland, though Gaelic typefaces were designed and produced in France, Belgium, and Italy. Gaelic typefaces make use of insular letterforms, and early fonts made use of a variety of abbreviations deriving from the manuscript tradition. Various forms exist, including manuscript, traditional, and modern styles, chiefly distinguished as having angular or uncial features.\nMonospaced typefaces.\nMonospaced fonts are typefaces in which every glyph is the same width (as opposed to variable-width fonts, where the \"w\" and \"m\" are wider than most letters, and the \"i\" is narrower). The first monospaced typefaces were designed for typewriters, which could only move the same distance forward with each letter typed. Their use continued with early computers, which could only display a single font. Although modern computers can display any desired typeface, monospaced fonts are still important for computer programming, terminal emulation, and for laying out tabulated data in plain text documents; they may also be particularly legible at small sizes due to all characters being quite wide. Examples of monospaced typefaces are Courier, Prestige Elite, Fixedsys, and Monaco. Most monospaced fonts are sans-serif or slab-serif as these designs are easiest to read printed small or display on low-resolution screens, though many exceptions exist.\nCJK typefaces.\nCJK, or Chinese, Japanese and Korean typefaces consist of large sets of glyphs. These typefaces originate in the glyphs found in brush calligraphy during the Tang dynasty. These later evolved into the Song style (\u5b8b\u4f53\u5b57) which used thick vertical strokes and thin horizontal strokes in wood block printing.\nThe glyphs found in CJK fonts are designed to fit within a square. This allows for regular vertical, horizontal, right-to-left and left-to-right orientations. CJK fonts can also include an extended set of monospaced Latin characters. This commonly results in complex, sometimes contradictory rules and conventions for mixing languages in type.\nMincho.\nWith CJK typefaces, Mincho style tends to be something like Serifs for the end of stems, and in fact includes Serifed glyphs for Extended Latin and Cyrillic sets within a typeface.\nGothic.\nWith CJK typefaces, Goth style tends to be something like Sans Serifs with squarish, cut off end-caps for the end of stems, and in fact includes Sans Serif glyphs for Extended Latin and Cyrillic sets within a typeface.\nMaru.\nWith CJK typefaces, Maru style tends to be something like Sans Serifs with rounded end-caps for the end of stems, and in fact includes Rounded Sans Serif glyphs for Extended Latin and Cyrillic sets within a typeface.\nDisplay type.\nDisplay type refers to the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are considered useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect typefaces are display types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many display typefaces in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.\nIn the days of metal type, when each size was cut individually, types intended for display use were often adjusted accordingly. These modifications continued to be made even after fonts started to be made by scaling using a pantograph, but began to fade away with the advent of phototypesetting and then digital fonts, which can both be printed at any size. Premium digital fonts used for magazines, books and newspapers do often include display variants, but they are often not included with typefaces bundled with operating systems and desktop publishing software. Display typefaces in the letterpress period were often made as wood type, being lighter than metal.\nDecades into the desktop publishing revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type experience are still working, and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so the misuse of the term display typeface as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces. At the same time, with new printing techniques, typefaces have largely replaced hand-lettering for very large signs and notices that would once have been painted or carved by hand.\nScript typefaces.\nScript typefaces imitate handwriting or calligraphy. They do not lend themselves to quantities of body text, as people find them harder to read than many serif and sans-serif typefaces; they are typically used for logos or invitations. Historically, most lettering on logos, displays, shop frontages did not use fonts but was rather custom-designed by signpainters and engravers, so many emulate the styles of hand-drawn signs from different historical periods. The genre has developed rapidly in recent years due to modern font formats allowing more complex simulations of handwriting. Examples include Coronet (a quite simple design from 1937) and Zapfino (a much more complicated digital design).\nMimicry typefaces.\nMimicry typefaces are decorative typefaces that have been designed to represent characters of one alphabet but at the same time evoke another writing system. This group includes Roman typefaces designed to appear as Arabic, Chinese characters (Wonton fonts), Cyrillic (Faux Cyrillic), Indic scripts, Greek (an example being Lithos), Hebrew (Faux Hebrew), Kana, or Thai. These are used largely for the purpose of novelty to make something appear foreign, or to make businesses offering foreign products, such as restaurants, clearly stand out. This typographic mimicry is also known as a faux font (named faux x, where x is usually a language script), pseudoscript, ethnic typeface, simulation typeface or a \"foreign look\" font.\nReverse-contrast typefaces.\nA reverse-contrast type is a typeface in which the stress is reversed from the norm: instead of the vertical lines being the same width or thicker than horizontals, which is normal in Latin-alphabet printing, the horizontal lines are the thickest. Reverse-contrast types are rarely used for body text, and are particularly common in display applications such as headings and posters, in which their unusual structure may be particularly eye-catching. First seen in London in 1821, they were particularly common in the mid- to late nineteenth century in American and British printing and have been revived occasionally since then. They effectively become slab serif designs because of the serifs becoming thick, and are often characterised as part of that genre. In recent times, the reverse-contrast effect has been extended to other kinds of typeface, such as sans-serif designs.\nEffect typefaces.\nSome typefaces have a structure that suggests a three-dimensional letter, such as letters carved into stone. An example of this is the genre known as 'inline', 'block' 'outline' or 'shadowed' typefaces. This renders the interior of glyphs in the background color, with a thin line around the edges of the glyphs. In some cases, the outline shows the glyph filled in with the foreground color, surrounded a thin outline mirroring the edges separated by a small gap. (This latter style is often used with \"college\" typefaces.) Colorized block lettering is often seen in carefully rendered graffiti.\nA \"shadow\" effect can also be either designed into a typeface or added to an existing typeface. Designed-in shadows can be stylized or connected to the foreground. An after-market shadow effect can be created by making two copies of each glyph, slightly offset in a diagonal direction and possibly in different colors. Drop shadows can also be dynamically created by rendering software. The shadow effect is often combined with the outline effect, where the top layer is shown in white with black outline and the bottom layer in black, for greater contrast. An example typeface with an 'inline' effect is Imprint Shadowed, where the shadowed version is more widely distributed than the regular design.\nSmall print typefaces.\nSome typefaces are specifically designed to be printed at small sizes, for example in telephone directories or on newsprint paper. Bell Gothic and Bell Centennial, commissioned for telephone directories, are notable examples of this. Small-print designs often feature a large x-height, and a chunky design. Some fonts used at such sizes may be members of a larger typeface family joining members for normal sizes. For example, the Times New Roman family contains some designs intended for small print use, as do many families with optical sizes such as Minion.\nIn the metal type era, typefaces intended to be printed small contained ink traps, small indentations at the junctions of strokes that would be filled up with ink spreading out, maintaining the intended appearance of the type design. Without ink traps, the excess ink would blob and ruin the crisp edge. At larger sizes, these ink traps were not necessary, so display faces did not have them. They have also been removed from most digital fonts, as these will normally be viewed on screen or printed through inkjet printing, laser printing, offset lithography, electrophotographic printing or other processes that do not show the ink spread of letterpress. Ink traps have remained common on designs intended to be printed on low-quality, absorbent paper, especially newsprint and telephone directories.\nTypeface family.\nA typeface family (or type family) is a set of typefaces that share a common design concept. The simplest typeface family has just a 'regular' face and an 'oblique' face (or 'Roman' and 'Italic'); the next step up adds boldface versions of these types. A modern professional typeface family (such as Danish Standard no. 737) might have as many as 54 different styles: condensed, normal and expanded forms of each of 'thin', 'extralight', 'light', 'regular', 'medium', 'demibold', 'bold', 'extrabold' and 'heavy' types, in regular and italic.\nTexts used to demonstrate typefaces.\nA sentence that uses all of the alphabet (a pangram), such as \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\", is often used as a design aesthetic tool to demonstrate the personality of a typeface's characters in a setting (because it displays all the letters of the alphabet). For extended settings of typefaces graphic designers often use nonsense text (commonly referred to as \"greeking\"), such as \"lorem ipsum\" or Latin text such as the beginning of Cicero's \"In Catilinam\". Greeking is used in typography to determine a typeface's \"colour\", or weight and style, and to demonstrate an overall typographic aesthetic prior to actual type setting. Another common demonstration word is \"Hamburgevons\".\nNon-character typefaces.\nThe process of printing typefaces has historically been far simpler than commissioning and engraving custom illustrations, especially as many non-text features of printed works like symbols and borders were likely to be reused by a printer in future. Non-character typefaces have therefore been created for elements of documents that are not letters but are likely to be reused regularly. These include:\nOrnamental typefaces.\nOrnamental (also known as \"novelty\" or sometimes \"display\") typefaces are used to decorate a page. Historically complex interlocking patterns known as arabesques were common in fine printing, as were floral borders known as fleurons evoking hand-drawn manuscripts.\nIn the metal type era, type-founding companies often would offer pre-formed illustrations as fonts showing objects and designs likely to be useful for printing and advertisements, the equivalent of modern clip art and stock photographs. As examples, the American Type Founders specimen of 1897 offered designs including baseball players, animals, Christmas wreaths, designs for cheques, and emblems such as state seals for government printing. The practice has declined as printing custom illustrations and colour printing using processes such as lithography has become cheaper, although illustration typefaces are still sold by some companies. See above for the historical definition of \"display typeface\".\nSymbol typefaces.\nSymbol, or dingbat, typefaces consist of symbols (such as decorative bullets, clock faces, railroad timetable symbols, CD-index, or TV-channel enclosed numbers) rather than normal text characters. Common, widely used symbol typeface releases include Zapf Dingbats and Wingdings, though many may be created internally by a publication for its own use and some typefaces may have a symbol range included. Marlett is an example of a font used by Windows to draw elements of windows and icons.\nEmoji.\nEmoji are pictograms that can be used and displayed inline with text. They are similar to previous symbol typefaces, but with a much larger range of characters, such as symbols for common objects, animals, food types, weather and emotions. Originally developed in Japan, they are now commonly installed on many computer and smartphone operating systems. Following standardisation and inclusion in the Unicode standard, allowing them to be used internationally, the number of Emoji characters has rapidly increased to meet the demands of an expanded range of cultures using them; unlike many previous symbol typefaces, they are interchangeable with the ability to display the pictures of the same meaning in a range of fonts on different operating systems. The popularity of emoji has meant that characters have sometimes gained culture-specific meanings not inherent to the design. Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.\nMusic typefaces.\nTypefaces that include musical notes and other needed symbols have been developed to print sheet music.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64107", "revid": "31311149", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64107", "title": "Alcatraz Island", "text": "Island in San Francisco Bay, California, US\nAlcatraz Island () is a small island about 1.25 miles offshore from San Francisco in San Francisco Bay, California, near the Golden Gate Strait. The island was developed in the mid-19th century with facilities for a lighthouse, a military fortification, and a military prison. In 1934, the island was converted into a federal prison, Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. The strong tidal currents around the island and ice-cold water temperatures made escape nearly impossible, giving the prison one of the most notorious reputations of its kind in American history. The prison closed on March 21, 1963, leaving the island a major tourist attraction today with nearly 1.4 million people visiting the island annually. \nBeginning in November 1969, the island was occupied for more than 19 months by a group of Native Americans, initially primarily from San Francisco, who were later joined by the American Indian Movement and other urban Native Americans from other parts of the country, who were part of a wave of Native American activists organizing public protests across the US through the 1970s. In 1972, Alcatraz was transferred to the Department of Interior to become part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986.\nToday, the island's facilities are managed by the National Park Service as part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Visitors can reach the island by ferry ride from Pier 33, located between the San Francisco Ferry Building and Fisherman's Wharf. Hornblower Cruises, operating under the name Alcatraz City Cruises, is the official ferry provider to and from the island.\nAlcatraz Island is the site of the abandoned federal prison, the oldest operating lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States, early military fortifications, and natural features such as rock pools and a seabird colony (mostly western gulls, cormorants, and egrets). According to a 1971 documentary on the history of Alcatraz, the island measures by and is at highest point during mean tide. The total area of the island is reported to be .\nLandmarks on the island include the Main Cellhouse, Dining Hall, Lighthouse, the ruins of the Warden's House and Social Hall, Parade Grounds, Building 64, Water Tower, New Industries Building, Model Industries Building, and the Recreation Yard.\nHistory.\nThe first European to document the islands of San Francisco Bay was Spanish naval officer and explorer Juan Manuel de Ayala during the Spanish rule of California; he charted San Francisco Bay in 1775. He named today's Yerba Buena Island as \"La Isla de los Alcatraces\", which translates as \"The Island of the Gannets\", but is commonly believed to translate as \"The Island of the Pelicans\" (the modern Spanish word for pelican is \"pel\u00edcano\"), from the archaic Spanish \"\" (\"pelican\"). No gannets are native to the Pacific Coast, making the older Spanish usage more likely.\nYerba Buena Island was labeled on Ayala's 1775 chart of San Francisco Bay as \"Isla de Alcatraces\". The name was later applied to the rock now known as Alcatraz Island by Captain Frederick W. Beechey, an English naval officer and explorer.\nOver the years, the Spanish version \"Alcatraz\" became popular and is now widely used. In August 1827, for instance, French Captain Auguste Bernard Duhaut-Cilly wrote \"... running past Alcatraze's (Pelicans) Island ... covered with a countless number of these birds. A gun fired over the feathered legions caused them to fly up in a great cloud and with a noise like a hurricane.\" The California brown pelican (\"Pelecanus occidentalis californicus\") is not known to nest on the island today. The Spanish built several small buildings on the island and other minor structures.\nFort Alcatraz.\nThe earliest recorded private owner of the island of Alcatraz is Julian Workman, to whom it was given by Mexican Governor Pio Pico in June 1846, with the understanding that Workman would build a lighthouse on it. Julian Workman is the baptismal name of William Workman, co-owner of Rancho La Puente and a personal friend of Pio Pico. Later in 1846, acting in his capacity as military governor of California, John C. Fr\u00e9mont bought the island for $5,000 in the name of the United States government from Francis Temple.\nIn 1850, President Millard Fillmore ordered that Alcatraz Island be set aside specifically as a United States military reservation, for military purposes based upon the U.S. acquisition of California from Mexico following the Mexican\u2013American War. Fr\u00e9mont had expected a large compensation for his initiative in purchasing and securing Alcatraz Island for the U.S. government, but the U.S. government later invalidated the sale and paid Fr\u00e9mont nothing. Fr\u00e9mont and his heirs sued for compensation during protracted but unsuccessful legal battles that extended into the 1890s.\n Following the acquisition of California by the United States as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which ended the Mexican\u2013American War, and the onset of the California Gold Rush the following year, the U.S. Army began studying the suitability of Alcatraz Island for the positioning of coastal batteries to protect the approaches to San Francisco Bay. In 1853, under the direction of Zealous B. Tower, the United States Army Corps of Engineers began fortifying the island, work which continued until 1858, when the initial version of Fort Alcatraz was complete. The island's first garrison, numbering about 200 soldiers, arrived at the end of that year.\nWhen the American Civil War broke out in 1861, the island mounted 85 cannons (increased to 105 cannons by 1866) in casements around its perimeter, though the small size of the garrison meant only a fraction of the guns could be used at one time. At this time, it also served as the San Francisco Arsenal for storage of firearms to prevent them falling into the hands of Confederate sympathizers. Alcatraz, built as a \"heavily fortified military site on the West Coast\", was to form a \"triangle of defense\" with Fort Point and Lime Point, but the contemplated work on Lime Point was never built. The first operational lighthouse on the West Coast of the United States was also built on Alcatraz. During the war, Fort Alcatraz was used to imprison Confederate sympathizers and privateers on the west coast, but its guns were never fired at an enemy.\nStudies of the island and its fortifications have included archeological surveys relying on contemporary technology. In 2019 \"Binghamton University archaeologist Timothy de Smet and colleagues located historical remains beneath the former recreation yard of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary.\" Using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data and georectifications, Smet and colleagues discovered structures, including \"a 'bombproof' earthwork traverse along with its underlying vaulted brick masonry tunnel and ventilation ducts,\" in surprisingly good condition. Archaeologists also found the remains of ammunition magazines, and tunnels below the penitentiary that was built later.\nBecause of the isolation created by the cold, strong currents of the waters of San Francisco Bay, as early as 1859, Alcatraz was used to house soldiers convicted of crimes. By 1861, the fort was the military prison for the Department of the Pacific. It housed Civil War prisoners of war (POWs) as early as that year.\nStarting in 1863, the military also held private citizens accused of treason, after the writ of habeas corpus in the United States was suspended. Hundreds of troops were trained on the island, with more than 350 military personnel in place by April 1861. As enlistees were assigned to units, new green troops reported for training. In early 1865, the number of men reached 433, the peak of the war.\nDuring the Civil War-era, rapid changes in artillery and fortification were generated. Alcatraz's defenses were obsolete by the postwar years. Modernization efforts, including an ambitious plan to level the entire island and construct shell-proof underground magazines and tunnels, were undertaken between 1870 and 1876 but never completed (the so-called \"parade ground\" on the southern tip of the island represents the extent of the flattening effort). Instead, the army switched the focus of its plans for Alcatraz from coastal defense to detention, a task for which it was well suited because of its isolation.\nIn 1867, a brick jailhouse was built (previously inmates had been kept in the basement of the guardhouse), and in 1868, Alcatraz was officially designated as a long-term detention facility for military prisoners. The facility was later discontinued for Prisoners of War in 1846. Among those incarcerated at Alcatraz were Confederates caught on the West Coast and some Hopi Native American men in the 1870s, who refused orders to send their children away from their families to Indian boarding schools.\nIn 1898, due to the Spanish\u2013American War, the prison population rose from 26 to over 450. From 1905 to 1907 it was commanded by U.S. Army Major George W. McIver. After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, civilian prisoners were transferred to Alcatraz for safe confinement. On March 21, 1907, Alcatraz was officially designated as the Western U.S. Military Prison, later Pacific Branch, U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, 1915.\nIn 1909 construction began on the huge concrete main cell block, designed by Major Reuben Turner, which remains the island's dominant feature. It was completed in 1912. To accommodate the new cell block, the Citadel, a three-story barracks, was demolished down to the first floor, which was below ground level. The building had been constructed in an excavated pit, creating a defensive dry moat. The first floor was incorporated as a basement to the new cell block, giving rise to the popular legend of \"dungeons\" below the main cell block. The US Disciplinary Barracks was deactivated in October 1933 and transferred to the Bureau of Prisons.\nDuring World War I, the prison was used to hold conscientious objectors, including Philip Grosser, who wrote a pamphlet entitled \"Uncle Sam's Devil's Island\" about his experiences.\nAlcatraz Federal Penitentiary.\nThe United States Disciplinary Barracks on Alcatraz were acquired by the United States Department of Justice on October 12, 1933, and the island was designated as a federal prison in August 1934. Alcatraz was designed to hold prisoners who continuously caused trouble at other federal prisons. At 9:40 am on August 11, 1934, the first batch of 137 prisoners arrived at Alcatraz, arriving by railroad from the United States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, to Santa Venetia, California. They were escorted to Alcatraz, while handcuffed in high security coaches and guarded by 60 special FBI agents, U.S. Marshals and railway security officials.\nMost of the prisoners were notorious bank robbers and murderers. The prison initially had a staff of 155, including the first warden James A. Johnston and associate warden J. E. Shuttleworth, both considered to be \"iron men\". The staff were highly trained in security, but not rehabilitation. Despite what was said about the jail, prisoners requested to be transferred to Alcatraz Island due to its single-cell occupancy and high quality of food. \nDuring the 29 years it was in use, the prison held some of the most notorious criminals in American history, including gangsters such as Al Capone, Robert Franklin Stroud (the \"Birdman of Alcatraz\"), George \"Machine Gun\" Kelly and Bumpy Johnson, and political terrorists such as Rafael Cancel Miranda, a member of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party who attacked the United States Capitol building in 1954. Others included Mickey Cohen, Arthur R. \"Doc\" Barker, and Alvin \"Creepy\" Karpis, who served more time at Alcatraz than any other inmate. \nAlcatraz Island also served as a residential community for Bureau of Prisons staff and their families. Correctional officers and their families lived in designated apartment buildings on the island. Children attended a dedicated school and, years later, many created an Alumni Association to share memories and reflect on their distinctive experience growing up on \u201cThe Rock.\u201d https://\nContrary to popular belief, it was possible to escape and swim all of the way to shore. However, during its 29 years of operation, the penitentiary claimed that no prisoner successfully escaped. A total of 36 prisoners made 14 escape attempts, two men trying twice. 23 were caught alive, six were shot and killed during their escape, two drowned, and five are listed as \"missing and presumed drowned\". The most violent incident occurred on May 2, 1946, when a failed escape attempt by six prisoners led to the Battle of Alcatraz. Perhaps the most famous is the intricate escape, carried out on June 11, 1962, by Frank Morris, John Anglin, and Clarence Anglin. The three men are believed to have drowned in their attempt. However, no bodies were ever found, sparking speculation that they made it to shore and escaped.\nOn June 11, 1962, brothers John and Clarence Anglin and Frank Morris escaped Alcatraz prison. John, Clarence, and Frank were all doing time for committing crimes such as bank robbery. They did this by digging through a vent for approximately three months, once they reached the top it took additional time to file down the bolts of the roof vents. They used sharpened spoons, a vacuum cleaner motor drill, and any other tools they could find to make the hole in the vent bigger and get through the bolted roof top vent. To fulfill their plan of escaping they made realistic dummy heads by using paper mache to disguise them while they do nightly checks. They used hair clippings to make it believable that they were still sleeping in their beds during nightly checks. Getting out of the prison was only half their plan, they had to make it 1.25 miles in shark infested waters. They created rafts out of prison rain jackets and several life preservers; they were able to contract this idea from magazines they would read while being in prison. They had come up with waterproof glue as well to keep the raft together in the water. Then they made wooden paddles out of leftover wood scraps and plywood found around the prison. To blow up their raft they stole a concertina and used it to inflate their makeshift raft. At around 10pm on June 11th 1962 they made the escape and were never seen again. A fourth prisoner, Allen West, had intended to escape with Morris and the Anglins, but failed to get out of his cell in time. He would later cooperate with the FBI during their investigation, revealing the finer details of the escape plan.\nAlthough most escapees were caught or drowned, in 1962, prisoner John Paul Scott made it to the shore. However, he was so weary that police found him unconscious and in hypothermic shock. The annual Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon includes a required swim from the island to the bay shore.\nClosing of the prison.\nThere are several reasons that Alcatraz closed as a penitentiary in 1963. The penitentiary cost much more to operate than other prisons (nearly $10 per prisoner per day, as opposed to $3 per prisoner per day at Atlanta). To add on, fresh water was impossible to get from around the Island to nearly 1 Million gallons of water had to be transported weekly.https:// Half a century of salt water saturation had severely eroded the buildings and three people had purportedly escaped in 1962. After its closure, George Moscone received public proposals to repurpose Alcatraz Island.\nNative American occupation.\nAlcatraz Island was occupied by Native American activists for the first time on March 8, 1964. The protest, proposed by Lakota Sioux activist Belva Cottier and joined by about 35 others, was reported by, among others, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and the \"San Francisco Examiner\".\nBeginning on November 20, 1969, a group of Native Americans called United Indians of All Tribes, mostly college students from San Francisco, occupied the island to protest federal policies related to American Indians. Some of them were children of Native Americans who had relocated in the city as part of the Bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Indian termination policy, which was a series of laws and policies aimed at the assimilation of Native Americans into mainstream US society. It encouraged Native Americans to move away from the Indian reservations and into cities to take advantage of health, educational and employment opportunities. A number of employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs also occupied Alcatraz at that time, including Doris Purdy, an amateur photographer, who later produced footage of her stay on the island.\nThe occupiers, who stayed on the island for nearly two years, demanded that the island's facilities be adapted and new structures built for an Indian education center, ecology center, and cultural center. The American Indians claimed the island by provisions of the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868) between the US and the Sioux; they said the treaty promised to return all retired, abandoned, or out-of-use federal lands to the native peoples from whom they were acquired. Indians of All Tribes claimed Alcatraz Island by the \"Right of Discovery\"; as historian Troy R. Johnson states in \"The Occupation of Alcatraz Island\", generations of indigenous peoples knew about Alcatraz at least 10,000 years before any European knew about any part of North America. Begun by urban Indians of San Francisco, the occupation attracted other Native Americans from across the country, including American Indian Movement (AIM) urban activists from Minneapolis.\nDuring the nineteen months and nine days of occupation by the American Indians, several buildings at Alcatraz were damaged or destroyed by fire, including the lighthouse keeper's home, the warden's home, the Officers' Club, the recreation hall, and the Coast Guard quarters. The origin of the fires is disputed. The US government demolished a number of other buildings (mostly apartments) after the occupation had ended. Graffiti from the period of Native American occupation is still visible at many locations on the island.\nDuring the occupation, President Richard Nixon rescinded the Indian termination policy, designed by earlier administrations to end federal recognition of many tribes and their special relationship with the US government. He established a new policy of self-determination, in part as a result of the publicity and awareness created by the occupation. The occupation ended on June 11, 1971.\nAlcatraz under the National Park Service.\nIn 1972, the National Park Service purchased Alcatraz along with Fort Mason from the U.S. Army to establish the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Under \"An Act to Establish the Golden Gate National Recreation Area\" President Richard Nixon allocated $120 million for land acquisition and development of the area. It has since been under the direction of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and now operates as a tourist site and museum dedicated to its time as a federal penitentiary. Operating costs still remain one of its biggest challenges today.\nOn May 4, 2025, President Donald Trump proposed reopening the island's prison. Later that night, Trump told reporters that his Alcatraz plan was \"just an idea I've had\" to counter the \"radicalized judges [that] want to have trials for every single\u2014think of it\u2014every single person that's in our country illegally,\" a reference to his invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to conduct mass deportations of Venezuelan and Salvadoran migrants, which had been blocked by multiple judges.\nLandmarks.\nPart of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area since 1972, the entire Alcatraz Island was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. In 1986 it was designated as a National Historic Landmark, the highest recognition.\nIn 1993, the National Park Service published a plan entitled \"Alcatraz Development Concept and Environmental Assessment.\" This plan, approved in 1980, doubled the area of Alcatraz accessible to the public, in order to enable visitors to enjoy its scenery and bird, marine, and animal life.\nMajor sites in the cultural landscape include:\nDevelopment.\nAmerican Indigenous groups, such as the International Indian Treaty Council, occasionally hold ceremonies on the island, most notably, their \"Sunrise Gatherings\" every Columbus Day and Thanksgiving Day.\nAround 2007, the Global Peace Foundation proposed to raze the prison and build a peace center in its place. Supporters collected 10,350 signatures \u2013 sufficient to have it placed as a proposition on the presidential primary ballots in San Francisco for February 5, 2008. The proposed plan was estimated at US$1 billion. For the plan to pass, Congress would have to have taken Alcatraz out of the National Park Service. Critics of the plan said that Alcatraz is too rich in history to be destroyed. On February 6, 2008, the Alcatraz Island Global Peace Center Proposition C failed to pass, with 72% of voters rejecting the proposition.\nThe coastal environment of the San Francisco Bay Area has caused deterioration and corrosion of building materials throughout Alcatraz. Beginning in 2011, the National Park Service began major renovations on the island, including the installation of solar panels on the cell house roof, slope stabilization near the Warden's House, and the stabilization and rehabilitation of the outer cell house walls.\nNow one of San Francisco's major tourist attractions, Alcatraz drew some 1.7 million visitors annually according to a 2018 report. Visitors arrive by ferry, operated under contract by Alcatraz Cruises LLC at Pier 33. \nThe 2018 report indicated that \"former prison buildings are being conserved and seismically upgraded and additional areas of the Island are opened to the public as safety hazards are removed\". During the COVID-19 pandemic, the buildings and the island remained closed to the public for more than a year (and ferry services were suspended), reopening in March 2021.\nArt.\nAlcatraz has been home to several art installations. In 2014, Chinese artist/dissident Ai Weiwei staged an exhibition which explored \"questions about human rights and freedom of expression\" called @Large. This exhibition included Lego portraits of famous political prisoners. The creation of the exhibition was featured in a 2019 documentary film, \"\". In 2016, Nelson Saiers used math and prison slang as central elements in a six-month installation that called attention to the imposition of long prison sentences.\nFauna and flora.\nFlora.\nGardens planted by families of the original Army post, and later by families of the prison guards, fell into neglect after the prison closure in 1963. After 40 years, they are being restored by a paid staff member and many volunteers, thanks to funding by the Garden Conservancy and the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy. The untended gardens had become severely overgrown and had developed into a nesting habitat and sanctuary for numerous birds. Now, areas of bird habitat are being preserved and protected, while many of the gardens are being restored to their original state.\nIn clearing out the overgrowth, workers found that many of the original plants were growing where they had been planted \u2013 some more than 100 years ago. Numerous heirloom rose hybrids, including a Welsh rose (Bardou Job) that had been believed to be extinct, have been discovered and propagated. Many species of roses, succulents, and geraniums are growing among apple and fig trees, banks of sweet peas, manicured gardens of cutting flowers, and wildly overgrown sections of native grasses with blackberry and honeysuckle.\nIn popular culture.\nAlcatraz Island appears often in media and popular culture, including films dating from 1962: \"\" (2023),\n\"Slaughterhouse Rock\" (1988), \"The Book of Eli\" (2010), \"\" (2006), \"Catch Me If You Can\" (2002), \"The Rock\" (1996), \"Murder in the First\" (1995), \"Escape from Alcatraz\" (1979), \"The Enforcer\" (1976), \"Point Blank\" (1967) \", Carmen Sandiego (1991), Birdman of Alcatraz\" (1962) and J. J. Abrams' 2012 television series \"Alcatraz\".\nIt also was featured in the anime \"Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters\", the book \"Al Capone Does My Shirts\" and the video game \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4\" as a playable level. It is also showcased as a playable racetrack in the 1997 arcade racing video game \"\". Alcatraz has also been portrayed often as a safe haven or base of operations in many post-apocalyptic movies, such as \"The Book of Eli\".\n\"Escape from Alcatraz\" and \"The Rock\" are two films that show how inescapable the island is. \"Escape from Alcatraz\" is based on the true story of a few inmates trying to flee the island. \"The Rock\" is an action film featuring Alcatraz.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded by Henry I in 1121 \"for the salvation of my soul, and the souls of King William, my father, and of King William, my brother, and Queen Maud, my wife, and all my ancestors and successors.\" In its heyday the abbey was one of Europe's largest royal monasteries. The traditions of the Abbey are continued today by the neighbouring St James's Church, which is partly built using stones of the Abbey ruins.\nReading Abbey was the focus of a major \u00a33 million project called \"Reading Abbey Revealed\" which conserved the ruins and Abbey Gateway and resulted in them being re-opened to the public on 16 June 2018. Alongside the conservation, new interpretation of the Reading Abbey Quarter was installed, including a new gallery at Reading Museum, and an extensive activity programme.\nAbbey Ward of Reading Borough Council takes its name from Reading Abbey, which lies within its boundaries. Now HM Prison Reading is on the site.\nHistory.\nThe abbey was founded by Henry I in 1121. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands within Reading, along with land at Cholsey, then in Berkshire, and Leominster in Herefordshire. He also arranged for further land in Reading, previously given to Battle Abbey by William the Conqueror, to be transferred to Reading Abbey, in return for some of his land at Appledram in Sussex.\nFollowing its royal foundation, the abbey was established by a party of monks from Cluny Abbey in Burgundy, together with monks from the Cluniac priory of St Pancras at Lewes in Sussex. The abbey was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St John the Evangelist. The first abbot, in 1123, was Hugh of Amiens who became archbishop of Rouen and was buried in Rouen Cathedral.\nAccording to the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury, the abbey was built on a gravel spur \"between the rivers Kennet and Thames, on a spot calculated for the reception of almost all who might have occasion to travel to the more populous cities of England\". The adjacent rivers provided convenient transport, and the abbey established wharves on the River Kennet. The Kennet also provided power for the abbey water mills, most of which were established on the Holy Brook, a channel of the Kennet of uncertain origin.\nWhen Henry I died in Lyons-la-For\u00eat, Normandy in 1135 his body was returned to Reading, and was buried in the front of the altar of the then incomplete abbey.\nBecause of its royal patronage, the abbey was one of the pilgrimage centres of medieval England, and one of its richest and most important religious houses, with possessions as far away as Herefordshire and Scotland. The abbey also held over 230 relics including the hand of St James. A shrivelled human hand was found in the ruins during demolition work in 1786 and is now in St Peter's Catholic Church, Marlow. The song Sumer is icumen in, which was first written down in the abbey about 1240, is the earliest known six-part harmony from Britain. The original document is held in the British Library.\nReading Abbey was frequently visited by kings and others, most especially by Henry III who often visited three or four times a year staying several weeks on each visit. It also hosted important state events, including the meeting between Henry II and the Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1185, the wedding of John of Gaunt and Blanche of Lancaster in 1359 and a meeting of Parliament in 1453.\nThe abbey was mostly destroyed in 1538 during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries. The last abbot, Hugh Faringdon, was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered in front of the Abbey Church. After this, the buildings of the abbey were extensively robbed, with lead, glass and facing stones removed for reuse elsewhere.\nSome twenty years after the Dissolution, Reading town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the former refectory of the hospitium of the abbey. The lower floor of this building continued to be used by Reading School, as it had been since 1486. For the next 200 years, the old monastic building continued to serve as Reading's town hall, but by the 18th century it was suffering from structural weakness. Between 1785 and 1786, the old hall was dismantled and replaced on the same site by the first of several phases of building that were to make up today's Reading Town Hall. Around 1787, Henry Seymour Conway removed a large amount of stone from the wall and used it to build Conway's Bridge near his home at Park Place outside Henley.\nSt James's Church and School was built on a portion of the site of the abbey between 1837 and 1840. Its founder was James Wheble, who owned land in the area at that time. Reading Gaol was built in 1844 on the eastern portion of the abbey site, replacing a small county Gaol on the same site. James Wheble sold the rest of his portion of the abbey site to Reading Corporation to create the Forbury Gardens, which were opened in 1861.\nAbbey ruins.\nThe inner rubble cores of the walls of many of the major buildings of the abbey still stand. The only parts of the Abbey Church that still exist are fragments of the piers of the central tower, together with parts of transepts, especially the south transept. In a range to the south of this transept are, in order, the remains of the vestry, the chapter house, the infirmary passage and the ground floor of the dorter or monks dormitory and reredorter or toilet block. The best preserved of these ruins are those of the chapter house, which is apsidal and has a triple entrance and three great windows above. To the west of this range, the site of the cloister is laid out as a private garden and to the south is a surviving wall of the refectory. The ruins are Grade I listed and a Scheduled monument\nRestoration.\nOver the years the ruins have been repaired and maintained in a piecemeal fashion leading to their deterioration. In April 2008, the cloister arch, chapter house and treasury were closed to the public. Repair work began in March 2009 and was expected to take only a few weeks, but the entire site was instead closed in May 2009 due to the risk of falling masonry.\nIn late 2010, Reading Borough Council was reported as estimating that the ruins could cost \u00a33m to repair, but it was also stated that the extent of the damage was yet to be determined. A survey was carried out in October 2010, using three-dimensional scans to build up a detailed view of each elevation, thus helping to identify the extent of the conservation required. In April 2011 plans for an \u00a38m revamp were unveiled, with the aim to create an Abbey Quarter cultural area in Reading. In June 2014 the Council secured initial funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF); more detailed plans for the project, Reading Abbey Revealed, were then developed and submitted to the HLF in September 2015.\nIn October 2014, a temporary scaffold roof, not visible from ground level, was installed on the Gateway to allow the building to dry out until funding for more permanent repairs was secured. The HLF confirmed that the second round application had been successful in December 2015. The HLF supported the project with a grant of \u00a31.77 million, with Reading Borough Council match funding of \u00a31.38 million. Historic England provided additional grant funding for initial work to the Abbey gateway and the conservation of the refectory wall. Work began in September 2016 and the ruins reopened to the public on 16 June 2018.\nHidden Abbey Project.\nIn spring 2014, historian-screenwriter Philippa Langley, MBE, best known for her contribution to the exhumation of Richard III in 2012, together with local historians John and Lindsay Mullaney, put together a complementary effort called the Hidden Abbey Project (HAP). The goal of the HAP was to perform a modern comprehensive study, including a non-invasive analysis of the grounds using ground-penetrating radar (GPR). The first phase of the GPR survey, focusing on the Abbey Church, St James\u2019 Church, the Forbury Gardens, and the Reading Gaol car park, began in June 2016. Initial results indicate some potential grave sites behind the high altar in an apse at the east end of the Abbey. There are also some findings probably related to the Abbey's construction, as well as some other potential archaeological targets. News reports seized on the fact that the grave sites were found underneath the Ministry of Justice car park at Reading Gaol. Said the Telegraph:\nBritain\u2019s kings appear to be making a habit of this. First it was Richard III, whose bones were found under a car park in Leicester. Now it appears that Henry I may have met a similarly undignified fate.\nHowever, the borough council's press release stated, \"The graves are located behind the High Altar in an apse at the east end of the Abbey. They are located east of the area where King Henry I's grave is believed to be. No direct connection between these features and King Henry can be made using these results alone.\"\nOther remains.\nBesides the ruins of the abbey itself, there are several other remains of the larger abbey complex still extant.\nAbbey Gateway.\nThe Abbey's Inner Gateway, also known as the Abbey Gateway, adjoins Reading Crown Court and Forbury Gardens. It is one of only two abbey buildings that have survived intact, and is a grade I listed building. The Inner Gateway marked the division between the area open to the public and the section accessible only to monks. Hugh Faringdon, the last abbot of Reading was hanged, drawn, and quartered outside the Abbey Gateway in 1539. The gateway survived because it was used as the entrance to the abbots' lodging, which was turned into a royal palace after the Dissolution. In the late 18th century, the gateway was used as part of the Reading Ladies' Boarding School, attended amongst others by the novelist Jane Austen.\nThe gateway was heavily restored by Sir George Gilbert Scott, after a partial collapse during a storm in 1861. It was extensively restored again after some decorative stonework came loose and fell into the street in 2010, reopening in 2018. The room above the gateway is now used by Reading Museum as part of its learning programme for local schools, whilst the arch below is available for use by pedestrian and cycle traffic.\nHospitium.\nThe abbey's hospitium, or dormitory for pilgrims, also survives. Known as the \"Hospitium of St. John\" and founded in 1189, the surviving building is the main building of a larger range of buildings that could accommodate 400 people. Much of the remainder of this range of buildings was located where Reading Town Hall now stands. Today the surviving building occupies a rather isolated site, with no direct street access. It abuts the main concert hall of Reading Town Hall to the west, and the south of the building opens directly onto the churchyard of St Laurence's Church. The building is surrounded to the north and east by a modern office development, with a small intermediate courtyard.\nAbbey Mill and Holy Brook.\nSome remains of the former Abbey Mill are visible alongside the Holy Brook at the south of the abbey site; they consist of a ruined former watermill on the Holy Brook, a channel of the River Kennet. The ruins are grade II listed. It is situated just to the south of the ruins of the Abbey itself. The water mill originally belonged to Reading Abbey, whose monks are believed to have created the Holy Brook as a water supply to this and other mills owned by them and to the abbey's fish ponds.\nThe mill was built straddling the Holy Brook which marked the southern boundary of the monastic enclosure. It continued to grind corn into the 1950s. Today, all that remains is a section of wall, pierced by three arches. The wall is built of flint with caen stone ashlar dressings and brick filling. The two side arches are round headed, whilst the centre arch over the Holy Brook is larger and pointed.\nThe Holy Brook is a long, largely artificial, watercourse which flows out of the River Kennet near the village of Theale, passes just to the south of the Abbey, and returns to its parent river just downstream of the Abbey Mill.\nOpen-air theatre and performance.\nThe ruins of Reading Abbey have a history of live performance. From early impromptu artist-led events, the site has established a history of open-air theatre.\nIn the late 1980s, the food art and performance collective La Grande Bouche organised a cabaret under marquee in the ruins. The evening offered music and performance acts combined with food, much of which cooked by contributing performers.\nIn 1994, a large scale performance event \"From the Ruins\" was held in the abbey ruins, the finale event for the \"Art in Reading\" (AIR) festival, funded in part by Reading Borough Council. This was organised by and featured a large number of artists and performers living or working in Reading, and combined specially created music, dance, paintings, poetry and culminated in a spectacular evening performance involving large scale puppetry and pyrotechnics loosely based upon the history of Reading Abbey from the foundation by Henry I through the rise of the merchant classes to the dissolution and eventual sacking of the Abbey under Henry VIII.\nIn 1995, the ruined South Transept was used as the setting for the first Abbey Ruins Open Air Shakespeare production by MDM Productions and Progress Theatre in partnership with Reading Borough Council. In 1996, the outdoor production moved to the ruined chapter house and since 1999 has been staged by Progress Theatre in partnership with Reading Borough Council. This annual event expanded to the \"Reading Abbey Ruins Open Air Festival\" in 2007. Because of the access limitations during the restoration project, the 2009 and 2010 festivals could not be held, and the event has since relocated to the gardens of Caversham Court. \"Shakespeare in the Ruins\" returned to the Chapter House in July 2018 after the ruins reopened to the public after extensive conservation in June 2018.\nAbbots.\nAs an abbey, Reading was ruled by an abbot. The abbey had 27 abbots between 1123 and 1539.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These skates required a pole with a sharp metal spike that was used for pushing the skater forward, unlike modern bladed skates.\nModern skates come in many different varieties, each suited to specific conditions or activities. People across the globe wear skates recreationally in ice rinks or on frozen bodies of water, and skates are the standard footwear in many sports, including figure skating, bandy, ice hockey, ringette, rink bandy, rinkball, speed skating and tour skating.\nHistory.\nAccording to a study done by Federico Formenti, University of Oxford, and Alberto Minetti, University of Milan, Finns were the first to develop ice skates some 5,000 years ago from animal bones. This was important for the Finnish populations to save energy in harsh winter conditions when hunting in Finnish Lakeland. Finland has about 187,888 lakes, which separated villages from each other. To travel between villages, the Finnish people had two options: to take a longer route around the lake, or to find a way across the frozen surface of the lake. \nThe earliest known skate to use a metal blade was found in Fennoscandia, and was dated to 200 AD. It was fitted with a thin strip of copper folded and attached to the underside of a leather shoe.\nStarting in 1976, during excavations of the city of York, UK, 42 pairs of Viking-era ice skates were found at Coppergate; the majority are made from horse leg bones, although cattle leg bones were also used. The bones were cut flat and polished on one side and drilled with a hole at one end. A leather thong, held in place by a wooden peg, was inserted into the hole to attach the skate to the wearer\u2019s ankle. The Viking invasion of York took place on November 1, 866. This would suggest that bone ice skates were being used in England from the ninth century.\nWilliam Fitzstephen, writing in the 12th century, described the use of bone skates in London. The following seems to be an Early Modern English translation of the Latin original:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;when the great fenne or moore (which watereth the walles of the citie on the North side) is frozen, many young men play upon the ice, some striding as wide as they may, doe slide swiftly... some tye bones to their feete, and under their heeles, and shoving themselves by a little picked staffe, doe slide as swiftly as birde flyeth in the aire, or an arrow out of a crossbow.\nIn the 13th century, the Dutch revolutionized ice skating by sharpening the blades of ice skates, which were made of steel at the time.\nTypes of ice skates.\nThere are five main types of ice skates: the figure skate, the ice hockey skate, the bandy skate, the racing skate, and the touring skate.\nFigure skates.\nFigure skates are used in the sport of figure skating. Unlike hockey skates, they have \"toe picks\" on the front of the blade, which are usually made out of stainless steel or aluminium with a steel runner. The toe pick has a variety of uses, but is most commonly used for certain jumps in figure skating, such as the Lutz jump and toe loop, or starting a backspin. Figure skating boots are typically made of several layers of leather and the leather is very stiff to provide ankle support. In addition, the figure skate's blade is curved, allowing for minute adjustments in balance and weight distribution.\nThe base of the figure-skate blade is slightly concave, or \"hollow ground\". The hollow, which runs the length of the blade, creates two edges, which come in contact with the ice. The forward part of the blade, the toe-rake, is saw-toothed and is used for jumps and spins on the toes.\nIce hockey skates.\nIce hockey skates are used for playing the games of ice hockey and ringette but are occasionally used for recreational ice skating alone. Each individual skate consists of a boot, laces, blade, and a blade holder. The boot is generally made of molded plastic, leather (often synthetic), ballistic nylon, or a thermoformed composite material. Each skate blade has two edges. Skates used in competitive ice hockey and ringette rarely use molded plastic for the upper boot, as this results in limited mobility.\nIce hockey goalie skates.\nThe skates used by goaltenders are cut lower in the ankle than a normal hockey skate and the boot sits closer to the ice for a lower center of gravity. The boot itself is encased in hardened plastic, called a \"cowling\", protecting the toe, ankle and heel from the force of the shot puck. The blade is usually longer and has less rocker (curvature to the blade) to make it easier for the goalie to move side to side in the crease. Goalie skates lack a tendon guard. Unlike regular hockey skates, goalie skates are usually protected by a synthetic material covering the toe-part of the skate. This is to prevent damage from the puck. The blade of the goalie skate is not as useful in turning as regular hockey skates, because the blade is rockered less, thus making turns slightly inconvenient. The material used to make the boot of the goalie skate historically was a harder synthetic material than regular hockey boots.\nSharpening ice hockey skates plays a key factor in a player's ability to skate and players will sharpen their skates hundreds of times throughout their career. Similar to figure skates, the blade is hollow ground in cross section, creating two edges that contact and cut into the ice, allowing increased maneuverability. The blades are sharpened with round-edged grinding wheels that create the two edges. The wheels grind out a hollow semi-circle along the length of the underside of the blade, forming the sharp edge on each side. Skate blade sharpness is measured by the thickness of the round-edged grinding wheel being used, the smaller the radius, the sharper the edge will be. The sharpness chosen by a player is based completely upon preference, not player size or level of play. While a radius of hollow is the most common and standard sharpening for most players, the standard radius of hollow for goalies is . \nBandy skates.\nBandy skates are used for playing the sports of bandy, rink bandy (bandy variant), and rinkball. The boot is generally made of leather (often synthetic) and often excludes tendon guards. The boot style for bandy skates is lower than the ice hockey version and often doesn't cover the ankles. The bandy skate is designed with the intention of preventing them from causing injury to an opponent due to its long, and relatively sharp angled blades. The blade is generally an inch longer than the hockey skates, allowing for higher speeds on the large bandy field (also called a \"bandy rink). The Russian bandy skates have an even longer blade and a very low cut shoe.\nBandy blades are sharpened differently than those on ice hockey skates with the bottom part of the bandy blade which touches the ice surface being flatter and generally excluding a hollow. Ice hockey blades are sharpened in a manner that creates two side edges which make contact with the ice. As a result, and by comparison, sharp cornering and \"tight turns\" which are maneuvers that can be achieved using the design of an ice hockey skate are not achievable on bandy skates. While the design of the modern ice hockey skate allows for sharper and faster maneuverability, modern bandy skates allow for more distance to be covered at a higher speed.\nRacing skates.\nRacing skates, also known as speed skates, have long blades and are used for speed skating. A clap skate (or \"clapper skate\") is a type of skate where the shoe is connected to the blade using a hinge. Short track racing skates have a longer overall height to the blade to allow for deep edge turns without the boot contacting the ice. For better turning ability, racing skates may have a radius, from for short track to for long track.\nRacing skates have a completely flat bottom. There is no hollow, only a squared off bottom with two edges. This improves glide time, by not cutting into the ice.\nTouring skates.\nTouring skates (or Nordic skates) are long blades that can be attached, via bindings, to hiking or cross-country ski boots and are used for long distance tour skating on natural ice. The blades are approximately long with a radius of curvature (or rocker) of about . The blades are from wide, with a flat cross-section. The length and long radius of the blades makes touring skates more stable on uneven natural ice than skates with shorter, more rockered blades. Since tour skating often involves walking (kluning) between lakes or around sections not suitable for skating, the removable blades are an asset. Thus, these skates are often called \"kluunschaats\" in the Netherlands.\nWith most modern models of skates, the blades are bonded to the bottom of an aluminum foot-plate. A binding for a specific type of boot is mounted on the top of the foot-plate. Traditionally, the bindings held down both toe and heel of the boot (\"fixed-heel\"). Some bindings require special boots like \"telemark\" ski boots with a \"duck-bill\" shaped toe, others, like the Multiskate, have padded adjustable straps that will attach to most hiking boots.\nSince the early 1990s, models have been designed for mounting \"free-heel\" cross-country ski bindings to the skates, and thus attach matching ski boots to the skates. The \"free-heel\" models give the equivalent effect as the klap skate form of speed skates. There are several makers of these skates in Sweden, Netherlands, and Finland.\nAlthough mainly used for non-competitive touring, \"nordic skates\" are sometimes used in marathon speed skating races on natural ice, such as Vikingar\u00e4nnet (The Viking Run), a long-distance tour skating event in Sweden. \"Nordic skates\" are also used in Winter triathlon races.\nHistorical wooden touring skates.\nBefore 1970, most touring skates had a wooden foot-plate which was attached to the boot with leather straps. Examples were the \"Gillbergs\" skate from Sweden, and the \"Stheemann\" \"wooden Norwegian\" from the Netherlands. Even earlier, in the years 1870 to 1900, there were very similar models made in North America, like the \"Donaghue\" from the U.S. In 1875, the , a design in which the blade extended several inches behind the heel, was introduced in the Netherlands. It was popular with both tour skaters (both casual and competitive) and sprint skaters (), and remained popular until some years after the Second World War.\nRecreational skates.\nInexpensive skates for recreational skaters usually resemble either figure skates or hockey skates, but recreational ice skates resembling inline skates with a molded plastic boot are also available. These recreational skates are commonly rented from ice rinks by beginners who do not own their own skates. In the non-American English-speaking world, they are sometimes called 'death wellies' by skaters who own their own equipment because of their appearance and their reputation for giving the wearer blisters. People who own their own skates may further reduce the risk of blisters by adding a friction management patch to areas inside the skate that could rub or chafe.\nDouble runner.\nAlso known as twin blade skates, cheese cutters, bob skates, or bobby skates, these skates are worn by young children who are learning. The double blades increase stability and help the child to balance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Built to consolidate Paris's ancient stone quarries, they extend south from the (\"Gate of Hell\") former city gate. The ossuary was created as part of the effort to eliminate the effects of the city's overflowing cemeteries. Preparation work began shortly after a 1774 series of basement wall collapses around the Holy Innocents' Cemetery added a sense of urgency to the cemetery-eliminating measure, and from 1788, nightly processions of covered wagons transferred remains from most of Paris's cemeteries to a mine shaft opened near the Rue de la Tombe-Issoire.\nThe ossuary remained largely forgotten until it became a novelty-place for concerts and other private events in the early 19th century; after further renovations and the construction of accesses around , it was opened to public visitation from 1874. Since 2013, the Catacombs have numbered among the fourteen City of Paris Museums managed by . Although the ossuary comprises only a small section of the underground mines of Paris, Parisians often refer to the entire tunnel network as the catacombs.\nHistory.\nParis's cemeteries.\nParis's earliest burial grounds were to the southern outskirts of the Roman-era Left Bank city. In ruins after the Western Roman Empire's 5th-century end and the ensuing Frankish invasions, this settlement was eventually abandoned for the marshy Right Bank: from the 4th century, the first known settlement there was on higher ground around a Saint-Etienne church and burial ground (behind the present ), and urban expansion on the Right Bank began in earnest after other ecclesiastical landowners filled in the marshlands from the late 10th century. Thus, instead of burying its dead away from inhabited areas as usual, the Paris Right Bank settlement began with cemeteries near its centre.\nThe most central of these cemeteries, a burial ground around the 5th-century Notre-Dame-des-Bois church, became the property of the Saint-Opportune parish after the original church was demolished by the 9th-century Norman invasions. When it became its own parish associated with the church of the \"Saints Innocents\" from 1130, this burial ground, filling the land between the present rue Saint-Denis, rue de la Ferronnerie, rue de la Lingerie and the rue Berger, had become the city's principal cemetery.\nBy the end of the same century, Saints Innocents was neighbour to the principal Parisian marketplace Les Halles, and already filled to overflowing. To make room for more burials, the long-dead were exhumed and their bones packed into the roofs and walls of \"charnier\" galleries built inside the cemetery walls. By the end of the 18th century, the central burial ground was a mound of earth filled with centuries of Parisian dead, plus the remains from the H\u00f4tel-Dieu hospital and the Morgue; other Parisian parishes had their own burial grounds, but the conditions in Saints Innocents were the worst.\nA series of ineffective decrees limiting the use of the cemetery did little to remedy the situation, and it was not until the late 18th century that it was decided to create three new large-scale suburban burial grounds on the outskirts of the city, and to condemn all existing parish cemeteries within city limits.\nThe future ossuary: Paris's former mines.\nMuch of the Left Bank area rests upon rich Lutetian limestone deposits. This stone built much of the city, but it was extracted in suburban locations away from any habitation. Because of the post 12th-century haphazard mining technique of digging wells down to the deposit and extracting it horizontally until depletion, many of these (often illicit) mines were uncharted, and when depleted, often abandoned and forgotten. Paris had annexed its suburbs many times over the centuries, and by the 18th century many of its arrondissements (administrative districts) were or included previously mined territories.\nThe undermined state of the Left Bank was known to architects as early 17th-century construction of the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce hospital (most of its building expenses were due to its foundations), but a series of mine cave-ins beginning 1774 with the collapse of a house along the \"rue d'Enfer\" (near today's crossing of the Avenue Denfert-Rochereau and the boulevard Saint-Michel) caused King Louis XVI to name a commission to investigate the state of the Parisian underground. This resulted in the creation of the \"inspection G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Carri\u00e8res\" (Inspection of Mines) service.\nOssuary creation.\nThe need to eliminate Les Innocents gained urgency from May 31, 1780, when a basement wall in a property adjoining the cemetery collapsed under the weight of the mass grave behind it. The cemetery was closed to the public and all \"intra muros\" (Latin: \"within the [city] walls\") burials were forbidden after 1780. The problem of what to do with the remains crowding \"intra muros\" cemeteries was still unresolved.\nMine consolidations were still occurring and the underground around the site of the 1777 collapse that had initiated the project had already become a series of stone and masonry inspection passageways that reinforced the streets above. The mine renovation and cemetery closures were both issues within the jurisdiction of the Police Prefect Police Lieutenant-General Alexandre Lenoir, who had been directly involved in the creation of a mine inspection service. Lenoir endorsed the idea of moving Parisian dead to the subterranean passageways that were renovated during 1782. After deciding to further renovate the \"Tombe-Issoire\" passageways for their future role as an underground sepulchre, the idea became law in late 1785.\nA well within a walled property above one of the principal subterranean passageways was dug to receive Les Innocents' unearthed remains, and the property itself was transformed into a sort of museum for all the headstones, sculptures and other artifacts recovered from the former cemetery. Beginning from an opening ceremony on 7 April the same year, the route between Les Innocents and the \"Clos de la Tombe-Issoire\" became a nightly procession of black cloth-covered wagons carrying the millions of Parisian dead. It would take two years to empty the majority of Paris's cemeteries.\nCemeteries whose remains were moved to the Catacombs include Saints-Innocents (the largest by far with about 2 million buried over 600 years of operation), Saint-\u00c9tienne-des-Gr\u00e8s (one of the oldest), Madeleine Cemetery, Errancis Cemetery (used for the victims of the French Revolution), and Notre-Dame-des-Blancs-Manteaux. By this way the skeletal remains of several notable victims of the French Revolution were transferred to the Catacombs, including (the date is the date of death): \nRenovation and ossuary decor.\nCatacombs in their first years were a disorganized bone repository, but Louis-\u00c9tienne H\u00e9ricart de Thury, director of the Paris Mine Inspection Service (Inspection g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des carri\u00e8res) from 1810, had renovations done that would transform the caverns into a visitable mausoleum. In addition to directing the stacking of skulls, femurs and tibias into the patterns seen in the catacombs today he used the cemetery decorations he could find (formerly stored on the Tombe-Issoire property; many had disappeared after the 1789 Revolution) to complement the walls of bones. Also created was a room dedicated to the display of the various minerals found under Paris, and another showing various skeletal deformities found during the catacombs' creation and renovation. He also added monumental tablets and archways bearing ominous warning inscriptions, and added stone tablets bearing descriptions or other comments about the nature of the ossuary, and to ensure the safety of eventual visitors, it was walled from the rest of Paris's Left Bank's already-extensive tunnel network.\nModern.\nDuring World War II, Parisian members of the French Resistance used the tunnel system and established the headquarters from where Colonel Rol-Tanguy led the insurrection for the liberation of Paris in June 1944. The Wehrmacht established an underground bunker below Lyc\u00e9e Montaigne, a high school in the 6th arrondissement.\nIn 2004, police discovered a fully equipped movie theater in an area of the catacombs underneath the Trocad\u00e9ro. It was equipped with a giant cinema screen, seats for the audience, projection equipment, film reels of recent thrillers and film noir classics, a fully stocked bar, and a complete restaurant with tables and chairs. The group \"les UX\" took responsibility for the installation.\nThe film \"As Above, So Below\", released in 2014, was the first production that secured permission from the French government to film in the catacombs. They aimed to use no alterations to the environment with the exception of a piano and a car which were hauled into the catacombs and set on fire.\nIn 2015, Airbnb paid \u20ac350,000 as part of a publicity stunt offering customers the chance to stay overnight in the Catacombs.\nIn August 2017, thieves broke into a cellar from the catacombs and stole more than \u20ac250,000 of wine.\nIn 2025, American Desert Rock band Queens of the Stone Age released an acoustic live performance entitled \"Alive in the Catacombs\", recorded in 2024 while on the European leg of \"The End Is Nero\" World Tour. On the WTF with Marc Maron podcast, frontman Joshua Homme described how it took 18 years to secure permission to record in the catacombs.\nDeaths.\nOnly one death has officially been confirmed in the Catacombs. In 1793, Philibert Aspairt, a door keeper for the Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce hospital, died in the catacombs. It is thought that he lost his light source and was left to die in the darkness. In 1804, 11 years later, his body was found, only a few meters from a staircase that led to an exit. He was only identified by his hospital key ring and the buttons on his jacket.\nVisits.\nAs one visits the catacombs, a sign above reads {{lang|fr|Arr\u00eate! C'est ici l'empire de la Mort}} (\"Stop! The empire of Death lies here\"). The Catacombs of Paris became a curiosity for more privileged Parisians from their creation, an early visitor being the Count of Artois (later Charles X of France) in 1787. Public visits began after its renovation into a proper ossuary and the 1814\u20131815 war. First allowed only a few times a year with the permission of an authorized mines inspector, but later more frequently and permitted by any mine overseer, a flow of visitors degraded the ossuary to a point where the permission-only rule was restored from 1830, and the catacombs were closed completely from 1833 because of church opposition to exposing human remains to public display. Open again for four visits a year from 1850, public demand caused the government to allow monthly visits from 1867, bi-weekly visits on the first and third Saturday of each month from 1874 (with an extra opening for the November 1 \"toussaint\" holiday), and weekly visits during the 1878, 1889 (the most visitors yet that year) and 1900 World's Fair Expositions. Later they opened for regular daily visits. After an incident of vandalism, the Catacombs were closed to the public during September 2009 and reopened on 19 December of the same year.\nDisruption of surface structures.\nBecause the catacombs are directly under the Paris streets, large foundations cannot be built above them and cave-ins have destroyed buildings. For this reason, there are few tall buildings in this area."}

For more than 30 years, he was one of the highest-profile individuals of the white nationalist movement. A physicist by profession, he authored the novels \"The Turner Diaries\" and \"Hunter\" under the pen name Andrew Macdonald. The first novel inspired multiple terrorist attacks, including the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Pierce founded the white nationalist National Alliance, an organization which he led for almost 30 years.\nBorn in Atlanta, Pierce received a bachelor's degree in physics from Rice University in 1955 as well as a doctorate from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1962. He became an assistant professor of physics at Oregon State University in that year. In 1965, he left his tenure at Oregon State University and became a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney in Connecticut. He moved to the Washington, D.C. area and became an associate of George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, who was assassinated in 1967. Pierce became co-leader of the National Youth Alliance, which split in 1974, with Pierce founding the National Alliance.\nPierce's novel \"The Turner Diaries\" (1978) depicts a violent revolution in the United States, followed by a world war and the extermination of non-white races. Another novel by Pierce, \"Hunter\" (1989) portrays the actions of a lone-wolf white supremacist assassin. In 1985, Pierce relocated the headquarters of the National Alliance to Hillsboro, West Virginia, where he founded the Cosmotheist Community Church. Pierce spent the rest of his life in West Virginia hosting a weekly show, \"American Dissident Voices\", and overseeing his publications, \"National Vanguard\" magazine (originally titled \"Attack!\")\",\" as well as books which were published by his publishing firm National Vanguard Books, Inc. and the white power music label Resistance Records.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Luther Pierce III was born in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 11, 1933. He was the eldest son of Marguerite Ferrell, a journalist, and William Luther Pierce II, an insurance salesman, who married in 1929. His father had served in World War I. Through his mother, Pierce's great-grandfather was Thomas H. Watts, the governor of Alabama and attorney general of the Confederate States of America. He had one younger brother, Sanders \"Sandy\" Pierce.\nHis family moved to Norfolk, Virginia, with his father's insurance business when Pierce was four years old. Pierce's upbringing was at times difficult. Pierce's son, Kelvin, described Pierce as having been born to a mother who rarely showed affection and an alcoholic father who entirely ignored him; Marguerite would pay Pierce to find the alcohol that William Sr. stashed around the house. Pierce's father was killed in a car accident involving a teenaged driver on January 30, 1943, when Pierce was nine years old.\nFollowing his father's death, Pierce and his brother were supported by their mother, and moved throughout the Southern United States. From the age of 10 on, Pierce worked odd jobs to help his family. Pierce attended public schools throughout the South, attending junior high in Dallas, Texas, until the family moved to Montgomery, Alabama. When his mother remarried, Pierce was sent to a military academy. His last two years in high school were spent at the Allen Military Academy in Bryan, Texas, where he did well academically. He worked at the school's chemistry stockrooms. Pierce later said that as a teen he had been \"sort of a nerdy kid without social skills\", awkward around women and with few friends. His teenage hobbies and interests were chemistry, electronics, and reading science fiction works, particularly the pulp magazine \"Planet Stories\". \nEducation and physics career.\nPierce earned a full scholarship to attend Rice University in Houston in 1951. He graduated from Rice in 1955 with a bachelor's degree. He worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory for a time in mid-1955, then did his graduate studies at California Institute of Technology starting later that year. At the University of Colorado Boulder, he earned a master's degree and a doctorate in 1962. His doctorate thesis was entitled \"Electrically Induced Nuclear Quadrupole Spin Transitions In A GaAs Single Crystal\" and he studied under the physicist W. H. Tantila. In 1957, Pierce married Patricia Jones, a mathematician whom he met while he was attending the California Institute of Technology. They had twin sons, Kelvin and Erik, born in 1960. \nAfter getting his doctorate, Pierce taught physics as an assistant professor at Oregon State University from 1962 to 1965. The only organization he belonged to at this time was the American Physical Society. A contemporary article from \"The Oregonian\" said of his time teaching at OSU that there was \"much respect for Pierce, but not much love\", particularly among his students. He was regarded as a very hard worker who never took breaks. His assistant reported that he was unpopular owing to a difficulty with getting along with him. Pierce's tenure as assistant professor at Oregon State University coincided with the rise of the civil rights movement and later the counterculture. \nAt this time, Pierce was a registered Republican, though he did not consider himself a member of the party and voted independently. At this time he considered himself largely uninterested in politics. During his education, Pierce paid little attention to the wider world; he claimed that he had initially been sympathetic to the idea of Black civil rights, but was suspicious of integration as damaging freedom of association. He was inflamed by what he viewed as a media bias against segregationists; when some of his colleagues blamed this on Jews, he became more interested in racial matters, and became increasingly militant in his thoughts on race. He blamed Jews for the civil rights movement, along with the protests against the Vietnam War. According to his son Kelvin, after Pierce became interested in racial matters he ceased to pay much attention to his children, outside of beating them. Pierce regularly physically abused his children. \nBeginning in 1962, he was a member of the anti-communist John Birch Society, and this at the time appealed to him. He did not agree with the widely held Bircher belief that all social movements they disliked were communist plots, and their refusal to discuss racial topics; he later wrote of the John Birch Society experience that \"I quickly found out that the two topics on which I wanted an intelligent discussion\u2014race and Jews\u2014were precisely the two topics Birch Society members were forbidden to discuss\". He resigned the next year, viewing the Birchers as \"too passive\" on racial topics. He saw the anti-communism as a distraction from the true issue, race, and expressed his disappointment that they were opposed to the civil rights movement, but \"weren't willing to deal with it on a racial basis\". In a 1966 interview he described his interest in Nazism increasing when he heard of interracial marriages among his coworkers at OSU, which disgusted him. His later decision to leave his job for unpaid work writing neo-Nazi literature baffled his OSU coworker David B. Nicodemus, though some of his students and an assistant were not surprised, saying he was fixated on Adolf Hitler and had read \"Mein Kampf\" in its original German. \nPierce left his job as a professor in June 1965 to become a senior researcher for the aerospace manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney in Connecticut. In his field he was generally successful. He worked as a senior research associate physicist at Pratt, earning a $15,400 a year salary. He received government security clearance for this job but never actually worked on classified projects. He directed a United States Air Force grant of $35,000 on semiconductors. There, he spent his time undertaking his own study of political and historical topics, which radicalized him further, reading alarmist books about race at the Yale University Library. He was not openly racist with his coworkers; when the ANP was investigated, his coworkers described him as a \"first-class physicist\", but also \"impenetrable\", and said they had an \"intense dislike of him as a person\". He was known as a loner and for the lack of instruction he gave subordinate researchers.\nWhite supremacy.\nAmerican Nazi Party.\nIn 1963, Pierce saw on television a clip of protests against George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party (ANP); intrigued by Rockwell, he struck up a correspondence with him. Pierce found Rockwell personally impressive, and the party's ideology appealed to him, but he disliked their explicit Nazi imagery. According to Rockwell, Pierce mailed him complaining Rockwell had some things right but was thinking too small, to which Rockwell said Pierce should do something himself. When he moved to work with Pratt &amp; Whitney, he began visiting Rockwell at his headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. He and Rockwell became increasingly close. After only a few months of work, his performance worsened and he attempted unsuccessfully to drive a car through a picket line of protestors during a wildcat strike at the plant he worked at. He took a vacation from Pratt &amp; Whitney in May 1966, returning to resign abruptly after less than a year of employment, claiming he had been writing hours a day for months and wished to be a writer. \nAfterwards, Pierce moved his family to Virginia. His wife became a university math teacher, and initially supporting Pierce in his aims. However, she did not agree with his political views. Pierce started a gun sales business, which sold machine guns. Due to the Gun Control Act of 1968, the business closed. He was the best educated associate of Rockwell, as well as the party's most enthusiastic promoter of violent action, believing that a National Socialist revolution required violence. Despite this he did not participate in the group's street actions. Pierce advocated Nordic superiority within the movement and said the leaders of the group should only come from \"pure Germanic stock\". He disliked and insulted ANP member John Patler on account of his ethnically Greek background, as did high ranking ANP member Matt Koehl. When, as a result of Patler's influence, Rockwell argued for a broader definition of the white race (including Slavs and Mediterraneans as white), Pierce and Koehl abhorred the idea and resisted, resulting in a schism in the partly leadership, though Rockwell eventually prevailed.\nPierce's activities within the ANP were mostly centered around writing and publication of ANP materials. In 1966, Pierce became the editor of the World Union of National Socialists quarterly ideological journal, \"National Socialist World\", for which he split the production costs with Rockwell. The publication was stylized like an academic quarterly and aimed at an academic racist audience. He was a close advisor to Rockwell and functioned as the ANP's \"house intellectual\". Pierce, interested in \"racial esotericism\", was largely responsible for the popularization of the works of Savitri Devi among the neo-Nazi and white nationalist movement. Pierce advised Rockwell on power and media tactics, largely responsible for Rockwell's publicity success with the 1966 Chicago \"White Power\" marches. Rockwell proposed a business partnership with Pierce, an \"Extremist Speakers Bureau\", offering a 20% commission on bookings for Pierce, who would be responsible for finding speakers. This never materialized. Pierce and Rockwell were largely in agreement; they shared a similar worldview and goals, but they also sometimes had disputes.\nNational Socialist White People's Party.\nPierce did not actually join the ANP until it was renamed the National Socialist White People's Party (NSWPP) in January 1967. Rockwell was murdered by Patler later that year. There was some speculation, though it was never proven, that Pierce had something to do with it. However, Patler was ultimately convicted. Some ANP members argued there was a conspiracy and Koehl, Pierce, and a man named Robert Allison Lloyd had orchestrated Rockwell's murder. The day before the murder, Rockwell got into an argument with the three of them. One eyewitness claimed that he locked them out of their offices and said he would expel them. Rockwell's secretary and mistress Barbara von Goetz became convinced that the three of them had ordered Rockwell's killing and framed Patler to seize control of the party; Francis Joseph Smith, Rockwell's personal bodyguard, investigated on his own and concluded that the three of them had orchestrated Rockwell's murder. Afterwards Pierce stayed in the NSWPP, under the leadership of Koehl, becoming one of its primary leaders.\nPierce was at the time the chief voice for violent action in the party. Pierce attempted to organize university students to the cause and promoted a philosophy of \"total revolution\", bringing young militant neo-Nazis into the party. The other key member of this faction was James Mason, later the author of \"Siege\", whom Pierce helped recruit into the party as a teenager. In 1968, he suggested to Mason, a teenage member of the party, that he move to the party's headquarters in lieu of murdering his school administration. Mason credited Pierce's intervention with saving both his life and other lives. Pierce became a prominent influence on Mason's life. Another was a teenage adherent, Joseph Tommasi. Pierce held Tommasi in high esteem for his militancy. In March 1969, a NSWPP phone line operated by Tommasi that played a prerecorded message by Pierce which advocated murdering Black people was shut down. Another Pierce message advocated murdering U.S. senators. That same year, born of their ideological commonality, Pierce and Tommasi launched the National Socialist Liberation Front (NSLF) as a youth wing of the NSWPP, aiming for it to appeal to white college students. He was sometimes invited to speak on university campuses. In one incident in 1970, he declared to an audience of University of Scranton students that Richard Nixon should be \"dragged out of his office and shot\"; Pierce was then investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who already had an interest in him prior. \nPierce affiliated with several different movements and became prominent as an organizer and leader of the white nationalist movement. Pierce felt the NSWPP's continual display of explicit Nazi regalia hurt their recruitment, and wanted a more American variety of white supremacy. He fell out with the rest of Rockwell's successors. The \"total revolution\" philosophy annoyed Koehl. He, Koehl, and Lloyd led the party into the 1970s. However, he did not think Koehl was a proper leader, so he asked for Koehl to formally share power with the other two of them. This evolved into a power struggle when Koehl, offended, retaliated; Pierce lost, and ultimately left in July 1970. He wrote a letter criticizing Koehl in the aftermath, declaring he would not be surprised if the party devolved into being \"a sort of Matt Koehl Nazi Fan Club\".\nNational Alliance and novels.\nAfter leaving the NSWPP, Pierce became an advisor to Willis Carto's National Youth Alliance. He created Youth for Wallace, an organization supporting the bid for the presidency of George Wallace, the former Governor of Alabama. Alongside Willis Carto, Youth for Wallace became the recruiting organization for the National Youth Alliance. The group was plagued by large amounts of infighting. Carto and Pierce had a falling out and the group split, leaving Pierce in control of the majority.\nIn 1974, the National Youth Alliance was restructured and renamed as the National Alliance. Pierce intended the organization to be a political vanguard that would ultimately bring about a white nationalist overthrow of the United States Federal Government. The National Alliance was the most significant neo-Nazi group to come out of the NSWPP, and also the largest. Pierce spent the rest of his life living in West Virginia. \nIn 1978, Pierce published \"The Turner Diaries\" under the pseudonym Andrew Macdonald, which became one of the most popular works of racist literature and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. It had started as a serial in the NA periodical \"Attack!\" in 1975. The book is a graphically violent depiction of a future race war in the United States, which includes a detailed description of the \"Day of the Rope\" mass hangings of many \"race traitors\", followed by the systematic ethnic cleansing of the city, and eventually the entire world. The story is told through the perspective of Earl Turner, an active member of the white revolutionary underground resistance, called The Organization, led by the secret inner circle known as The Order. \"The Turner Diaries\" inspired a group of white revolutionary nationalists in the early 1980s called The Order, after The Order in the novel. The Order was connected to numerous crimes, including counterfeiting, bank robbery, and murder.Pierce divorced his wife Patricia Jones in 1982. His rationale for the split was that it was \"necessary in order for me to have the peace of mind I need to do most effectively what I must do with my life\". He had very little contact with either of his children from then on, despite his son's repeated attempts to contact him. In 1983, Pierce married Elizabeth Prostel, which lasted until 1985. He also had ties to British National Party leader John Tyndall.\nIn 1989, Pierce published another novel, \"Hunter\", which tells the story of a man named Oscar Yeager, a veteran of the Vietnam War who begins by killing multiple interracial couples. He then assassinates liberal journalists, politicians and bureaucrats in the D.C. area. In interviews, Pierce called \"Hunter\" more realistic, and described his rationale for writing it as taking the reader through \"an educational process\". \nIn 1990, West Virginia Public Broadcasting made a documentary about Pierce, entitled \"Dr. No?\" It was directed by Jacob Young. The title is a reference to how Pierce imagined his detractors portraying him. \nHe hosted a weekly radio show, \"American Dissident Voices\", from 1991. The NA also distributed the \"National Vanguard\" periodical and maintained a website. Pierce rarely talked to the media, believing them to be dominated by Jews. While in West Virginia, the National Alliance was monitored by authorities, but mostly left to their own devices. The FBI investigated Pierce, with their file on him growing to hundreds of pages long. Unlike many white supremacist leaders of the period, Pierce was never convicted of any crime.\nPierce and \"The Turner Diaries\" gained attention following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing by Timothy McVeigh, who was inspired by the book. McVeigh used a very similar method to the book's main character, who is placed in charge of bombing the FBI headquarters with a fertilizer truck bomb. When McVeigh was arrested later that day, pages from the book were found with him, with several phrases highlighted. Pierce's stated opinion on the bombing varied; at one time Pierce denounced the bombing as it had not been at the right time. At other times, he said he did approve of the bombing. In 2000, Pierce was profiled in a biography entitled \"The Fame of a Dead Man's Deeds\" by academic Robert S. Griffin.\nDeath.\nIn early 2002 Pierce was diagnosed with cancer. Pierce died of kidney failure at his Hillsboro, West Virginia, compound on July 23, 2002. Shortly before his death, Pierce selected Erich Gliebe as his successor; Gliebe was the manager of Resistance Records. \nPierce's final public speech came on April 20, 2002 (Hitler's birthday). In this speech he criticized the rest of the White Power movement and other neo-Nazi groups, and promoted the cause of the National Alliance; this speech was divisive among white supremacists. This, in combination with in-group disputes and poor leadership, led to the National Alliance becoming far less significant after Pierce's death than it was under his leadership. In 2020, his son Kelvin coauthored \"Sins of My Father\", which chronicled his experiences with his father, and his rejection of his views.\nViews.\nPierce's views were centered around race, which he defined physically, culturally and spiritually; he believed that whites were the evolutionary peak of the human species and that they were being plotted against by Jews. He viewed other racial groups as not always inevitable enemies, with the exception of Jews, who he believed would inevitably conflict with white people. Pierce was frequently described as a neo-Nazi, although he personally rejected this label. When confronted with the issue by Mike Wallace on \"60 Minutes\", Pierce described the term as a slander, saying that though he \"admire[d] many things that Hitler wrote\", the National Alliance had \"formulated our own program in view of the situation that we face here in America today\". \nPierce was opposed to individualism and largely viewed politics as a manifestation of group dynamics, criticizing modern American society as atomized and selfish. He accused individualists such as Ayn Rand, who was ethnically Jewish, of plotting against whites by promoting individualism to them. Pierce's goal was to convince the white population through propaganda, leading ultimately to a violent race revolution; he promoted his views through several mediums. Particularly important to his political views was World War II, perceived by Pierce as the most important event in modern Western history. He saw it as the triumph of democracy over fascism, which he believed to be the detriment of future generations, and led to the 1960s counterculture. He believed the counterculture was a kulturkampf designed to destroy Western civilization.\nPierce was publicly critical of most contemporary right-wing terrorism, particularly lone wolf terrorism, though not for moral reasons. He agreed ideologically with the perpetrators of most right-wing lone wolf terrorism of the period, but thought it was ineffective at best and counterproductive at worst. He accepted that \"civilians are going to be killed\", but said the current time was incorrect for it and it lacked \"a plan that can be reasonably argued will get you what you want to achieve\". Despite these statements, Pierce dedicated his second book, \"Hunter\", to lone wolf terrorist Joseph Paul Franklin, and became associated with the strategy of leaderless resistance; he also had several followers who committed acts of lone-wolf terrorism. His approach to terrorism was, according to scholar George Michael, \"a gradual approach to terrorism with a preparatory stage which emphasized propaganda and organization\". \nAmong Pierce's claimed inspirations for the development of his views were Dietrich Eckart's \"Bolshevism from Moses to Lenin\", Friedrich Nietzsche's \"Thus\" \"Spoke Zarathustra\", August Kubizek's \"The Young Hitler I Knew\", and Savitri Devi's \"The Lightning and the Sun\". From Nietzsche he was particularly taken by the idea of being a master of one's own life and the points of power of the will. In Eckart's essay he found an ideological backing for his antisemitism, while he incorporated Devi's racist mysticism from \"Lightning and the Sun\" into his ideology. Also influential on the development of his political thought were the works of American white supremacists Francis Parker Yockey, Lothrop Stoddard, and Madison Grant. He was also influenced by white nationalist writer William Gayley Simpson; Pierce published Simpson's book, \"Which Way Western Man?\" in 1978. According to his son Kelvin, he had asked Pierce why he had chosen white supremacy over all else, to which Pierce responded that it \"was the only responsible thing I could do\".\nIn the 1970s, Pierce created a religious philosophy he called cosmotheism. Cosmotheism synergized mystical and scientific ideas. It combined Darwinian ideas with ancient Germanic legends. The faith was atheistic and did not believe in a particular god. It emphasizes evolutionary development, and portrays the future as a linear evolutionary path related to race. In 2001, Pierce officiated the Cosmotheist wedding ceremony of Billy Roper, then a top staffer at the National Alliance. Cosmotheism was highly esoteric in its beliefs, which led to it having little influence on neo-Nazis outside of the National Alliance. It was influenced somewhat by Savitri Devi's thought.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hannah was born in Meridian, Mississippi, on April 23, 1942, and grew up in Clinton, Mississippi. He wrote eight novels and five short story collections.\nHis first novel, \"Geronimo Rex\" (1972), was nominated for the National Book Award. \"Airships\", his 1978 collection of short stories about the Vietnam War, the American Civil War, and the modern South, won the Arnold Gingrich Short Fiction Award. The following year, Hannah received the prestigious Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Hannah won a Guggenheim, the Robert Penn Warren Lifetime Achievement Award, and the PEN/Malamud Award for excellence in the art of the short story.\nHannah was twice the recipient of a Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award in Fiction and received Mississippi's prestigious Governor's Award in 1989 for distinguished representation of the state of Mississippi in artistic and cultural matters. For a brief time Hannah lived in Los Angeles and worked as a writer for the film director Robert Altman. He was director of the MFA program at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he taught creative writing for 28 years. He died on March 1, 2010, of a heart attack.\nEarly life.\nHannah was born in Meridian, Mississippi, on April 23, 1942, and grew up in Clinton, Mississippi. He had three children, a daughter Lee and two sons, Barry Jr. and Ted. He was married three times, the last to Susan (Varas) Hannah (1946\u20132010).\nEducation.\nAt Mississippi College, Hannah majored in pre-med but later switched to literature. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Mississippi College in Clinton in 1964. He spent the next three years at the University of Arkansas, where he earned a Master of Arts in 1966 and a Master of Fine Arts in 1967.\nWriting.\nBarry Hannah's fictions contain situational humor that spans a wide gamut, from the surreal to grotesque and black humor. His first publication was a story that was placed in a national anthology of the best college writing when he was a student at the University of Arkansas. Soon after that, Hannah wrote \"Mother Rooney Unscrolls the Hurt\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And then I wrote my first truly good story, \"Mother Rooney Unscrolls the Hurt,\" which was a piece of my then-forthcoming book, \"Geronimo Rex\". I was about twenty-three. It really lit up for me, I thought. I don't really care what folks think of it now, but \"Mother Rooney\" was a springboard to the rest of my creative life.\nHannah's first novel, the coming-of-age tale \"Geronimo Rex\" (1972), was nominated for the National Book Award. \"Nightwatchmen\" (1973), his second novel, was a difficult book, and it is his only work never to be reissued in paperback. Hannah returned to form, however, with the short-story collection \"Airships\" (1978). Most of the stories in the volume were first published in \"Esquire\" magazine by its fiction editor at the time, Gordon Lish. The short novel \"Ray\" (1980) was a critical success and a minor breakthrough for Hannah, and one of his best-known novels.\nAfter the grotesque Western \"Never Die\" (1991), Hannah stuck to short stories for the rest of the decade, first with the immense \"Bats Out of Hell\" (1993), which featured 23 stories over close to 400 pages, making it Hannah's longest book, and then with \"High Lonesome\" (1996), which was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. After a near-fatal bout with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hannah returned in 2001 with \"Yonder Stands Your Orphan\" (the title is taken from Bob Dylan's song \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\"), his longest novel since \"Geronimo Rex\". In this novel, Hannah returned to a small community north of Vicksburg and to some of the characters featured in stories from \"Airships\" and \"Bats Out of Hell\".\nHannah attempted one more novel, which underwent several title changes. In a 2003 interview with the \"Austin Chronicle\", Hannah called it \"Last Days\". A 2005 interview with Hannah in \"The Paris Review\" featured a manuscript page from the then-titled \"Long, Last, Happy\". Then a 2009 issue of the literary journal \"Gulf Coast\" featured an excerpt from the novel, titled \"Sick Soldier at Your Door\". The same excerpt was printed in the June 2009 issue of \"Harper's Magazine\". A subsequent interview with Tom Franklin in the Summer 2009 issue of \"Tin House\" revealed that \"Sick Soldier at Your Door\" had been reconceived as a collection of short stories. The stories were published in November 2011 by Grove Press under the title \"Long, Last, Happy: New and Selected Stories\".\nTeaching.\nHannah taught creative writing at the Iowa Writers' Workshop, Clemson University, Bennington College, Middlebury College, the University of Alabama, Texas State University, and the University of Montana - Missoula.

Scarver Sr. (born July 6, 1969) is an American criminal who is known for the 1994 murders of his fellow inmates Jeffrey Dahmer and Jesse Anderson, both convicted murderers, at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Wisconsin. The three inmates were on a work detail together in the prison gymnasium, and had a confrontation while unsupervised. Scarver had concealed a metal bar that he used to beat and fatally injure Dahmer and Anderson. Scarver was convicted and sentenced to two further life sentences for these murders. He had already been sentenced to life in prison after being convicted of the murder of Steve Lohman in 1990.\nEarly life.\nScarver is the second of five children and was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. He attended James Madison High School before dropping out in the eleventh grade. His mother forced him out of her house after he became addicted to alcohol and marijuana. \nScarver was hired as a trainee carpenter in a Wisconsin Conservation Corps job program. He said that his supervisor, Edward Patts, promised that upon completion of this program he would be hired full-time. After Patts was dismissed, Scarver did not gain a full-time job there. \nHe began to drink heavily. Later he said that while drunk, he started to hear voices calling him the \"chosen one\". He was later diagnosed with schizophrenia and was said to have been suffering from messianic delusions.\nMurder of Steve Lohman.\nOn June 1, 1990, Scarver went to the Wisconsin Conservation Corps training office and found site manager John Feyen and employee Steve Lohman present. Forcing Lohman down at gunpoint, Scarver demanded money from Feyen. Upon receiving only US$15 from him (), the enraged Scarver shot Lohman once in the head, killing him. According to authorities, Scarver said: \"Now do you think I'm kidding? I need more money.\" After Scarver shot Lohman twice more, both post-mortem, Feyen wrote Scarver a check for US$3,000 (). As Feyen fled outside to his car, Scarver fired at him, but missed.\nIn 1992, Scarver was convicted of murder at a jury trial and sentenced to life in prison. He was incarcerated at the Columbia Correctional Institution in Portage, Wisconsin.\nMurders of Jeffrey Dahmer and Jesse Anderson.\nTwo years later, on the morning of November 28, 1994, Scarver was assigned to a work detail in the gymnasium with two other inmates: Jesse Anderson, convicted for murdering his wife; and Jeffrey Dahmer, a serial killer. When corrections officers left the three unsupervised, a confrontation ensued. Scarver went out and retrieved a metal bar from the weight room, which he used to bludgeon Dahmer. He then attacked Anderson with a wooden stick at the showers. He returned to his cell and informed a corrections officer \"God told me to do it. Jesse Anderson and Jeffrey Dahmer are dead.\"\nBoth men were mortally wounded by the beatings. Dahmer was declared dead an hour after arriving at the hospital. Anderson died two days later after doctors removed him from life support. \nScarver was assessed for mental illness and found competent to stand trial on murder charges for the two killings. He changed his \"not guilty\" plea to \"no contest\" in exchange for being transferred to a federal penitentiary, was convicted of each murder, and received two more life sentences. When asked if he believed his sentence was just, Scarver was quoted as having said \"Nothing white people do to blacks is just.\"\nAftermath.\nIn 1995, Scarver was transferred into the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons under the register number #08157-045. At the time, prison officials in Wisconsin believed they did not have a facility secure enough to house Scarver. Scarver underwent psychiatric evaluation again at the MCFP Springfield and was later transferred to ADX Florence, the federal supermax in Florence, Colorado, where he remained until 2000.\nIn 2000, Scarver was transferred to the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility when it opened. In 2001, federal district court judge Barbara Crabb ordered that Scarver and about three dozen other seriously mentally ill inmates be relocated from the Wisconsin facility. Scarver was eventually relocated to the Centennial Correctional Facility in Colorado.\nIn 2005, Scarver brought a federal civil rights suit against officials of the Wisconsin Secure Program Facility arguing that he had been subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, contrary to his constitutional rights. A district court judge dismissed the suit against several of the defendants and ruled that the actions of the remaining officials could not be considered unlawful. Scarver unsuccessfully appealed the decision in 2006. Scarver would later say that he had been held for 16 years in solitary confinement as a result of the murders of Dahmer and Anderson.\nIn 2012, an agent representing Scarver announced that he was willing to write a tell-all book about the murder of Dahmer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Specifically, acetonitrile is fed into the top of a distillation column filled with hydrocarbons including butadiene, and as the acetonitrile falls down through the column, it absorbs the butadiene which is then sent from the bottom of the tower to a second separating tower. Heat is then employed in the separating tower to separate the butadiene.\nIn the laboratory, it is used as a medium-polarity non-protic solvent that is miscible with water and a range of organic solvents, but not saturated hydrocarbons. It has a convenient range of temperatures at which it is a liquid, and dissolves a wide range of ionic and nonpolar compounds and is useful as a mobile phase in HPLC and LC\u2013MS.\nIt is widely used in battery applications because of its relatively high dielectric constant and ability to dissolve electrolytes. For similar reasons, it is a popular solvent in cyclic voltammetry.\nIts ultraviolet transparency UV cutoff, low viscosity and low chemical reactivity make it a popular choice for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nAcetonitrile plays a significant role as the dominant solvent used in oligonucleotide synthesis from nucleoside phosphoramidites.\nIndustrially, it is used as a solvent for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and photographic film.\nOrganic synthesis.\nAcetonitrile is a common two-carbon building block in organic synthesis of many useful chemicals, including acetamidine hydrochloride, thiamine, and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid, along with more complex nitriles. Its reaction with cyanogen chloride affords malononitrile.\nAs an electron pair donor.\nAcetonitrile has a free electron pair at the nitrogen atom, which can form many transition metal nitrile complexes. For example, bis(acetonitrile)palladium dichloride is prepared by heating a suspension of palladium chloride in acetonitrile:\nA related complex is tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate . The ligands in these complexes are rapidly displaced.\nIt also forms Lewis adducts with group 13 Lewis acids like boron trifluoride. In superacids, it is possible to protonate acetonitrile.\nProduction.\nAcetonitrile is a byproduct from the manufacture of acrylonitrile by catalytic ammoxidation of propylene. Most is combusted to support the intended process but an estimated several thousand tons are retained for the above-mentioned applications. Production trends for acetonitrile thus generally follow those of acrylonitrile. In 1992[ [update]], of acetonitrile were produced in the US.\nSafety.\nToxicity.\nAcetonitrile has only modest toxicity in small doses. It can be metabolised to produce hydrogen cyanide, which is the source of the observed toxic effects. Generally the onset of toxic effects is delayed, due to the time required for the body to metabolize acetonitrile to cyanide (generally about 2\u201312 hours).\nCases of acetonitrile poisoning in humans are rare but not unknown by inhalation and ingestion. The symptoms, which do not usually appear for several hours after the exposure, include breathing difficulties, slow pulse rate, nausea, and vomiting. Convulsions and coma can occur in serious cases, followed by death from respiratory failure. The treatment is as for cyanide poisoning, with oxygen, sodium nitrite, and sodium thiosulfate among the most commonly used emergency treatments.\nIt has been used in a formulation for removal of sculptured fingernails. At least two cases have been reported of accidental poisoning of young children by acetonitrile-based sculptured nail remover, one of which was fatal. Acetone and ethyl acetate are often preferred as safer for domestic use, and acetonitrile has been banned in cosmetic products in the European Economic Area since March 2000.\nMetabolism and excretion.\nIn common with other nitriles, acetonitrile can be metabolised in microsomes, especially in the liver, to produce hydrogen cyanide, as was first shown by Pozzani \"et al.\" in 1959. The first step in this pathway is the oxidation of acetonitrile to glycolonitrile by an NADPH-dependent cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. The glycolonitrile then undergoes a spontaneous decomposition to give hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde, a toxin and a carcinogen on its own, is further oxidized to formic acid, which is another source of toxicity.\nThe metabolism of acetonitrile is much slower than that of other nitriles, which accounts for its relatively low toxicity. Hence, one hour after administration of a potentially lethal dose, the concentration of cyanide in the rat brain was that for a propionitrile dose 60 times lower (see table).\nThe relatively slow metabolism of acetonitrile to hydrogen cyanide allows more of the cyanide produced to be detoxified within the body to thiocyanate (the rhodanese pathway). It also allows more acetonitrile to be excreted unchanged before it is metabolised. The main pathways of excretion are by exhalation and in the urine.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is best remembered for his theories of atmospheric electric currents that elucidated the nature of the aurora borealis. In order to fund his research on the aurorae, he invented the electromagnetic cannon and the Birkeland\u2013Eyde process of fixing nitrogen from the air. Birkeland was nominated for the Nobel Prize seven times.\nLife and death.\nBirkeland was born in Christiania (today Oslo) to Reinart and Ingeborg Birkeland (n\u00e9e Ege) and wrote his first scientific paper at the age of 18. Birkeland married Ida Charlotte Hammer in May 1905. They had no children and, due to Birkeland's preoccupation with his work, they divorced in 1911.\nSuffering from severe paranoia due to his use of barbital as a sleeping aid, he died under mysterious circumstances in his room in the Hotel Seiyoken in Tokyo while visiting colleagues at the University of Tokyo. A post-mortem revealed that Birkeland had taken 10 g of barbital the night he died, instead of the 0.5 g recommended. The time of death was estimated at 3am on 15 June 1917. Some authors have claimed that he committed suicide. \"On the nightstand lay a revolver\".\nResearch.\nBirkeland organized several expeditions to Norway's high-latitude regions where he established a network of observatories under the auroral regions to collect magnetic field data. The results of the Norwegian Polar Expedition conducted from 1899 to 1900 contained the first determination of the global pattern of electric currents in the polar region from ground magnetic field measurements.\nThe discovery of X-rays inspired Birkeland to develop vacuum chambers to study the influence of magnets on cathode rays. Birkeland noticed that an electron beam directed toward a terrella, a model of the Earth consisting of a spherical magnet, was guided toward the magnetic poles and produced rings of light around the poles and concluded that the aurora could be produced in a similar way. He developed a theory in which energetic electrons were ejected from sunspots on the solar surface, directed to the Earth, and guided to the Earth's polar regions by the geomagnetic field where they produced the visible aurora. This is essentially the theory of the aurora today.\nBirkeland proposed in 1908 in his book \"The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902\u20131903\" that polar electric currents, today referred to as auroral electrojets, were connected to a system of currents that flowed along geomagnetic field lines into and away from the polar region. Such field-aligned currents are known today as Birkeland currents in his honour. He provided a diagram of field-aligned currents in the book, and this diagram was reproduced on the back of the Norwegian 200 kroner 7th series banknote in the lower right corner, and his terrella experiment is shown on the front at the left with a portrait of Birkeland on the right. The book on the 1902\u20131903 expedition contains chapters on magnetic storms on the Earth and their relationship to the Sun, the origin of the Sun itself, Halley's Comet, and the rings of Saturn.\nBirkeland's vision of what are now known as Birkeland currents became the source of a controversy that continued for over half a century, because their existence could not be confirmed from ground-based measurements alone. His theory was disputed and ridiculed at the time as a fringe theory by mainstream scientists, most notoriously by the eminent British geophysicist and mathematician Sydney Chapman who argued the mainstream view that currents could not cross the vacuum of space and therefore the currents had to be generated by the Earth. Birkeland's theory of the aurora continued to be dismissed by mainstream astrophysicists after his death in 1917. It was notably championed by the Swedish plasma scientist Hannes Alfv\u00e9n, but Alfv\u00e9n's work in turn was also disputed by Chapman.\nProof of Birkeland's theory of the aurora only came in 1967 after a probe was sent into space. The crucial results were obtained from U.S. Navy satellite 1963-38C, launched in 1963 and carrying a magnetometer above the ionosphere. Magnetic disturbances were observed on nearly every pass over the high-latitude regions of the Earth. These were originally interpreted as hydromagnetic waves, but on later analysis it was realized that they were due to field-aligned or Birkeland currents.\nThe scale of Birkeland's research enterprises was such that funding became an overwhelming obstacle. Recognizing that technological invention could bring wealth, he developed an electromagnetic cannon and, with some investors, formed a firearms company. The coil-gun worked, except the high muzzle velocities he predicted (600\u00a0m/s) were not produced. The most he could get from his largest machine was 100\u00a0m/s, corresponding to a disappointing projectile range of only 1\u00a0km. So he renamed the device an aerial torpedo and arranged a demonstration with the express aim of selling the company. At the demonstration, one of the coils shorted and produced a sensational inductive arc complete with noise, flame, and smoke. This was the first failure of any of the launchers that Birkeland had built. It could easily have been repaired and another demonstration organized.\nHowever, fate intervened in the form of an engineer named Sam Eyde. At a dinner party only one week later, Eyde told Birkeland that there was an industrial need for the biggest flash of lightning that can be brought down to Earth in order to make artificial fertilizer. Birkeland's reply was, \"I have it!\" There were no more attempts to sell the firearms company, and he worked with Eyde only long enough to build a plasma arc device for the nitrogen fixation process. The pair worked to develop the prototype furnace into a design that was economically viable for large-scale manufacture. The resulting company, Norsk Hydro, hugely enriched Norway, and Birkeland then enjoyed adequate funding for research, his only real interest.\nThe Birkeland\u2013Eyde process is relatively inefficient in terms of energy consumption. Therefore, in the 1910s and 1920s, it was gradually replaced in Norway by a combination of the Haber process and the Ostwald process.\nIn 1913, Birkeland may have been the first to predict that plasma was ubiquitous in space. He wrote: \"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or nebulae, but in 'empty' space.\"\nIn 1916, Birkeland was probably the first person to successfully predict that the solar wind behaves as do all charged particles in an electric field: \"From a physical point of view it is most probable that solar rays are neither exclusively negative nor positive rays, but of both kinds\". In other words, the solar wind consists of both negative electrons and positive ions.\nThe first complete map of the statistical location of Birkeland currents in the Earth's polar region was developed in 1974 by A.J. Zmuda and J.C. Armstrong and refined in 1976 by T. Iijima and T.A. Potemra\nAs a scholar with wide interests, Birkeland joined the control commission of NSFPS (Norwegian Society For Psychic Research). The 299 members of the society included, by 1922, people like prime minister Gunnar Knudsen, as well as a wide range of doctors, professors and shipowners. The society arranged circles experimenting with dancing tables and automatic writing, but attracted more attention arranging controlled experiments with invited foreign mediums. In 1912 it was the alleged medium Etta Wriedt from Detroit, famous for her \"spirit trumpet\", who was exposed as a fraud. Mrs Wriedt's \"trumpet\" should have been speaking with the \"spirit voice\" of, among others, Hypatia, but in Norway the \"trumpet blows\" were exposed as explosions produced by potassium and water. Professor Birkeland exclaimed on that occasion, \"I'm supposedly against all witch burnings, but a teeny weeny one in honour of Mrs Wriedt would not have been in the way.\"\nLegacy.\nBirkeland's theory of the aurora was eventually confirmed and accepted as correct.\nAn example of one of his experiments is depicted on the left front of a previous version (issued in 1994) of the Norwegian 200 kroner note; it shows a magnetized terrella, simulating the Earth, suspended in an evacuated chamber. Birkeland's face appears a second time in a watermark in the blank space above the drawing of the terrella, and his rudimentary magnetosphere appears on the back, but is only visible under ultraviolet light. The ring encircling the magnetic pole depicted on the back of the bank note is similar to the patterns predicted by Birkeland and shown more recently by satellites. His drawing of what became known as Birkeland currents from his book, \"The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902\u20131903\", is shown on the back of the banknote at the right.\nIn 2017, Yara International ordered the , which will be the world's first autonomous ship and is named after Birkeland. It will enter service in 2018 and be fully autonomous by 2020.\n\"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds.\" \u2014 Kristian Birkeland 1913\n\"A very few lonely pioneers make their way to high places never before visited . . . they create the living conditions of mankind and the majority are living on their work.\" \u2014 Kristian Birkeland\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64149", "revid": "50897605", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64149", "title": "Norwegian krone", "text": "Currency\nThe krone (, abbreviation: kr (also NKr for distinction); code: NOK), plural \"kroner\", is the currency of the Kingdom of Norway (including overseas territories and dependencies). It was traditionally known as the Norwegian crown in English; however, this has fallen out of common usage. It is nominally subdivided into 100 \"\u00f8re\", although the last coins denominated in \u00f8re were withdrawn in 2012.\nThe krone was the thirteenth-most-traded currency in the world by value in April 2010, down three positions from 2007.\nIt is considered to be one of the world's G10 currencies, a group of the most traded currencies in the world.\nThe Norwegian krone is also informally accepted in many shops in Sweden and Finland that are close to the Norwegian border, and also in some shops in the Danish ferry ports of Hirtshals and Frederikshavn. Norwegians spent 14.1 billion NOK on border shopping in 2015 compared to 10.5 billion NOK spent in 2010. Border shopping is a fairly common practice amongst Norwegians, though it is seldom done on impulse. Money is spent mainly on food articles, alcohol, and tobacco, in that order, usually in bulk or large quantities. This is due to considerably higher taxes and fees on tobacco and alcohol purchased domestically in Norway.\nHistory.\nThe krone was introduced in 1875, replacing the Norwegian speciedaler/spesidaler at a rate of 4 kroner = 1 speciedaler. In doing so, Norway joined the Scandinavian Monetary Union, which had been established in 1873. The Scandinavian currencies were mutually exchangeable at par until 1914 with the suspension of the gold standard due to World War I. After this date, the currencies of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden ceased to be mutually equivalent to each other.\nWithin the Scandinavian Monetary Union, the krone was on a gold standard of 2,480 kroner = 1 kilogram of pure gold (1 krone = 403.226 milligrams of gold). The gold standard was suspended from 1914 to 1916 and from 1920 to 1928, and in 1931 it was permanently suspended. In 1933 the krone was pegged to the pound sterling at 1 pound = 19.9 kroner, and in 1939 the krone was pegged to the U.S. dollar at $1 = 4.4 kroner.\nDuring the German occupation (1940\u20131945) in the Second World War, the krone was initially pegged to the Reichsmark at a rate of 1 krone = 0.6 Reichsmark, later reduced to 0.57. After the war, a peg of 1 pound = 20 kroner was established in 1946, equivalent to US$1 = 4.963 kroner before the 1949 devaluation of sterling revised it to US$1 = 7.142 kroner.\nIn December 1992, the Central Bank of Norway abandoned the fixed exchange rate system in favor of floating exchange rates (managed float) due to the heavy speculation against the Norwegian currency in the early 1990s, which lost the central bank around two billion kroner in defensive purchases of the NOK through the usage of foreign currency reserves for a relatively short period of time.\nSummary of denominations issued.\nSources:\nCoins.\nIn 1875, coins were introduced (some dated 1874) in denominations of 10 and 50 \u00f8re and 1 and 10 kroner. These coins also bore the denomination in the previous currency, as 3, 15, and 30 skillings and &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 specidaler. Between 1875 and 1878, the new coinage was introduced in full, in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50 \u00f8re and 1, 2, and 10 kroner. The 1, 2, and 5 \u00f8re were struck in bronze; the 10, 25, and 50 \u00f8re and 1 and 2 kroner, in silver; and the 10 and 20 kroner, in gold.\nThe last gold coins were issued in 1910; silver was replaced by cupro-nickel in 1920. Between 1917 and 1921, iron temporarily replaced bronze. 1917 also saw the last issuance of 2 kroner coins. During the German occupation of Norway in the Second World War, zinc was used in place of cupro-nickel in 10, 25, and 50 \u00f8re coins and production of the 1 krone piece was suspended.\nIn 1963, 5 kroner coins were introduced. Production of 1 and 2 \u00f8re coins ceased in 1972. The following year, the size of the 5-\u00f8re coin was reduced; production of the denomination ceased in 1982, along with the minting of the 25 \u00f8re. Ten-kroner coins were introduced in 1983. In 1992, the last 10 \u00f8re coins were minted.\nBetween 1994 and 1998, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of 50 \u00f8re, 1, 5, 10, and 20 kroner. These are the only coins that are currently legal tender, with the exception of the 50 \u00f8re coin which was withdrawn on 1 May 2012. It was withdrawn because it was no longer circulating as an ordinary coin used for payment. However, banks in Norway still exchanged 50 \u00f8re coins for higher values until 2022.\nThe 10 and 20 kroner coins carry the effigy of the current monarch. Previously the 1 and 5 kroner coins also carried the royal effigy, but now these denominations are decorated only with stylistic royal or national symbols. The royal motto of the monarch (King Harald's motto is \"\", meaning \"Everything for Norway\") is also inscribed on the 10 kroner coin.\nCoins and banknotes of the Norwegian krone are distributed by the Central Bank of Norway.\nUp to 25 coins of any single denomination is considered \"\"\u2014a legally recognized method of payment, in which the intended recipient can not refuse payment, according to Norwegian law.\nUse of 10 Syrian pound coins in Norway.\nThe characteristics of the ten Syrian pound (LS\u00a010) coin have been found to so closely resemble the Norwegian 20 kroner (NKr\u00a020) coin that it can be used as a slug to fool vending machines, coins-to-cash machines, arcade machines, and any other coin-operated, automated service machine in the country. Machines are unable to tell the coins apart, owing to their almost identical weight and size.\nAs of mid-February 2017, LS\u00a010 was worth NKr 0.39, making the 20-kroner coin 51.5 times more valuable than the 10-pound coin. While not easy to find in Norway, the Syrian coins are still used in automated machines there with such frequency that , the Norwegian postal service, decided to close many of their coins-to-cash machines on 18 February 2006, with plans to develop a system able to differentiate between the two coins. In the summer of 2005, a Norwegian man was sentenced to 30 day suspended sentence, for having used Syrian coins in arcade machines in the municipality of B\u00e6rum.\nBanknotes.\nIn 1877, Norges Bank introduced notes for 5, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 kroner. In 1917, 1 krone notes were issued, and 2 kroner notes were issued between 1918 and 1922. Because of metal shortages, 1 and 2 kroner notes were again issued between 1940 and 1950. In 1963, 5 kroner notes were replaced by coins, with the same happening to the 10 kroner notes in 1984. Two hundred kroner notes were introduced in 1994.\nExchange rates.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Static row numbers/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nThe value of the Norwegian krone compared to other currencies varies considerably from one year to another, mainly based on changes in oil prices and interest rates. In 2002 the Norwegian krone grew to record high levels against the United States dollar and the euro. On 2 January 2002, 100 kroner were worth US$11.14 ($1 = 8.98\u00a0kroner). In July 2002, the krone hit a high at 100 kroner = $13.7 ($1 = 7.36\u00a0kroner). In addition to the high level of interest, which increased further on 4 July 2002, to 7 percent, the price of oil was high. At the time Norway was the world's third largest oil exporter.\nIn 2005, oil prices reached record levels of more than 60\u00a0dollars per barrel. Although interest rates had decreased to around 2 percent, the Norwegian krone grew even stronger.\nHowever, in late 2007 and early 2008, the dollar suffered a steady depreciation against all other major currencies. The Norwegian krone was gaining value at the same time; as a result, the krone became stronger than ever compared to the dollar, making the dollar worth about 5 kroner in April 2008. By October 2008, the dollar had recovered and was worth approximately 7 kroner. Following 2009, the krone once again saw strong growth, making the dollar worth about 5.8 kroner as of the beginning of 2010.\nSince the mid-2010s, the Norwegian krone has been slowly but steadily weakening against most currencies. This presents a mystery, as Norway's economy has been strong and growing, and the decline cannot be fully explained by either oil price changes or interest rate differences between countries. However, as of 2024[ [update]], the krone is still overvalued based on the Big Mac Index.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hairlessness in cats is a naturally occurring genetic mutation, and the Sphynx was developed through selective breeding of these animals, starting in the 1960s. \nThe skin has a texture of chamois leather, as it has fine hairs, or the cat may be completely hairless. Whiskers may be present, either whole or broken, or may be totally absent. Per the breed standards, they have a somewhat wedge-shaped head with large eyes and ears, quite long legs and tail, and neat rounded paws. Their skin is the color that their fur would be, and all the usual cat markings (solid, point, van, tabby, tortie, etc.) may be found on the Sphynx cat's skin. Because they have no fur, Sphynx cats lose body heat more readily than coated cats, making them both warm to the touch and prone to seeking out warm places.\nBreed standards.\nThe breed standard from The International Cat Association (TICA) calls for:\nHistory of the cat breed.\nThe contemporary breed of Sphynx cat is distinct from the Russian hairless cat breeds, like Peterbald and Donskoy. Although hairless cats have been reported throughout history, breeders in Europe have been developing the Sphynx breed since the early 1960s. Two different sets of hairless felines discovered in North America in the 1970s provided the foundation cats for what was shaped into the existing Sphynx breed.\nThe current North American and European Sphynx breed is descended from two lines of natural mutations:\nToronto.\nThe Canadian Sphynx breed was started in 1966 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, when a hairless male kitten named Prune was born to a black and white domestic shorthair queen (Elizabeth).\nAfter purchasing these cats in 1966 and initially referring to them as \"Moonstones\" and \"Canadian Hairless\", Ridyadh Bawa, a science graduate of the University of Toronto, combined efforts with his mother Yania, a longtime Siamese breeder, and Keese and Rita Tenhoves to develop a breed of cats which was subsequently renamed as \"Sphynx\". The Bawas and the Tenhoves were the first individuals able to determine the autosomal recessive nature of the Sphynx gene for hairlessness while also being successful in transforming this knowledge into a successful breeding program with kittens which were eventually capable of reproducing. The Tenhoves were initially able to obtain for the new breed provisional showing status through the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) but ultimately had the status revoked in 1971, when it was felt by the CFA Board that the breed had concerns over fertility.\nThe first breeders had rather vague ideas about Sphynx genetics and faced a number of problems. The genetic pool was very limited and many kittens died. There was also a problem with many of the females suffering convulsions. In 1978, cat breeder Shirley Smith found three hairless kittens on the streets of her neighborhood. In 1983, she sent two of them to Dr. Hugo Hernandez in the Netherlands to breed the two kittens, named Punkie and Paloma, to a white Devon Rex named Curare van Jetrophin. The resulting litter produced five kittens: two males from this litter (Q. Ramses and Q. Ra) were used, along with Punkie's half-sister, Paloma.\nMinnesota.\nThe first noted naturally occurring foundation Sphynx originated as hairless stray barn cats in Wadena, Minnesota, at the farm of Milt and Ethelyn Pearson. The Pearsons identified hairless kittens occurring in several litters of their domestic shorthair barn cats in the mid-1970s. Two hairless female kittens born in 1975 and 1976, Epidermis and Dermis, were sold to Oregon breeder Kim Mueske, and became an important part of the Sphynx breeding program. Also working with the Pearson line of cats was breeder Georgiana Gattenby of Brainerd, Minnesota, who outcrossed with Cornish Rex cats.\nGenetics and breeding.\nThe standard for the Sphynx differs between cat associations such as The International Cat Association (TICA), F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale F\u00e9line (FIFE) and Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA). Other hairless cat breeds have standards that differ from those of Sphynx. For example, the Don Sphynx and the Peterbald. The genes which cause hairlessness in these breeds differs from the ones which cause hairlessness in the Sphynx.\nBreeding.\nIn 2010, DNA analysis confirmed that Sphynx hairlessness was produced by a different allele of the same gene that produces the short curly hair of the Devon Rex (termed the \"re\" allele), with the Sphynx's allele being incompletely dominant over the Devon allele and both being recessive to the wild type. Other associations may vary, and the Russian Blue is a permitted outcross in the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF). \nGenetics.\nThe Sphynx's distinctive hairlessness is primarily due to a mutation in the KRT71 gene, which also affects other breeds, such as the Devon Rex and Selkirk Rex, albeit with different outcomes. This gene is responsible for the keratinization of the hair follicle. In the Sphynx, the mutation, known as \"hr\", leads to a complete loss of function, damaging the structure of the hair. Normally, KRT71 helps produce strong hair that is securely anchored to the skin. However, due to the \"hr\" mutation, the hair of Sphynx cats lacks a solid root or bulb, making it extremely weak. Consequently, the hair is fragile and loosely attached, causing it to fall out easily and contributing to the breed's nearly hairless appearance. Sphynx cats may still retain very soft, short hair on parts of their body, such as the nose, tails, and toes, but overall, their coat is significantly reduced and lacks the typical structure seen in other cats. \nIn the Devon Rex mutation, a residual activity of the protein still exists. The Selkirk Rex allele (sadr) is dominant over the wild type gene, which is dominant over the Devon Rex allele (re) and the Sphynx (hr), which forms an allelic series of : KRT71SADRE &gt; KRT71+ &gt; KRT71re &gt; KRT71hr.\nBehavior.\nSphynx are known for their extroverted behavior. They display a high level of energy, intelligence, curiosity and affection for their owners. They are one of the more dog-like breeds of cats, frequently greeting their owners at the door and are friendly when meeting strangers. Sphynx cats tend to be highly attached to their owners, often demanding large amounts of attention, and if said attention is not given, can get into trouble. The mischievous cats love to cuddle for body warmth, due to their lack of fur. A study was conducted by the \"Journal of Veterinary Behavior\" in 2012, and while further research needs to be conducted, purebred Sphynx cats were rated by their owners as friendlier than purebred European cats.\nCare.\nCare should be taken to limit the Sphynx cat's exposure to outdoor sunlight at length, as they can develop sunburn and skin damage similar to that of humans. In general, Sphynx cats should never be allowed outdoors unattended, as they have limited means to conserve body heat when it is cold. In some climates, owners provide coats or other clothing in the winter to help them conserve body heat.\nWhile they lack much of the fur of other cat breeds, Sphynxes are not necessarily hypoallergenic. Allergies to cats are triggered by a protein called Fel d1, not cat hair itself. Fel d1 is a protein primarily found in cat saliva and sebaceous glands. Those with cat allergies may react to direct contact with Sphynx cats. Even though reports exist that some people with allergies successfully tolerate Sphynx cats, they are fewer than those who have allergic reactions. \nThe skin of the Sphynx cat is known for its excessive production of a greasy secretion, which often results in the accumulation of a sticky, dark brown, or reddish-brown layer that necessitates regular cleaning. Furthermore, Sphynx cats typically produce more earwax than most hairy domestic cats. This increased wax production is attributed to the minimal to absent hair within their ears, which allows for the accumulation of dirt, skin oils (sebum), and ear wax, thereby requiring frequent cleaning. Additionally, they often accumulate oils and debris under their nails and within their numerous skin folds due to the lack of fur. Regular maintenance of these areas, including the nails and skin folds, is essential for the health and hygiene of the breed.\nHealth.\nThe Sphynx faces challenges because of its lack of protective fur. Skin cancer may be a problem if exposed to sunlight for long durations of time. \nThe lack of hair can cause health issues with kittens in the first weeks of life because of susceptibility to respiratory infections. Reputable breeders should not let their kittens go to new homes without being at least 14 weeks of age to ensure the kitten is mature enough to cope in a new environment.\nIn a review of over 5,000 cases of urate urolithiasis the Sphynx was over-represented, with four recorded cases out of a population of 28.\nLife expectancy.\nA study of veterinary records in the UK found the Sphynx to have average life expectancy of 6.68 years based on a sample of 18 cats, the lowest in the study and lower than the overall average of 11.74 years.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy.\nThe breed does have instances of the genetic disorder hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Other domestic cat breeds prone to HCM include Persian, Ragdoll, Norwegian Forest cat, Siberian cats, British Shorthair and Maine Coon; however, any domestic cat including mixed breeds can acquire HCM. Studies are being undertaken to understand the links in breeding and the disorder. Cats are screened for HCM disease with echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart), as well as with additional tests determined by the veterinarian cardiologist including electrocardiogram (EKG, ECG), chest radiographs (X-rays), and/or blood tests.\nThe Sphynx cat has a high rate of heart disease, either as HCM or mitral valve dysplasia. In a 2012 study of 114 Sphynx cats, 34% were found to have an abnormal heart, with 16 cats having mitral valve dysplasia and 23 cats having HCM. These prevalences were found in cats with an average age of 2.62 years. Male cats developed more severe disease than female cats and often developed it earlier, at an average age of 19 months for males and 29 months for females. Since the prevalence of genetic heart disease is high in this breed, many breeders will recommend screening for HCM yearly.\nAs HCM progresses into an advanced stage, cats may experience congestive heart failure (CHF) or thromboembolism.\nCongenital myasthenic syndrome.\nCongenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) previously referred to as muscular dystrophy, myopathy or spasticity, is a type of inherited neuromuscular disorder associated with alpha-dystroglycan deficiency, found in Sphynx and in Devon Rex cats as well as variants of these breeds, which can occur between the first 3 to 23 weeks of their life. This condition has also been described, but is rarely seen. Cats affected by CMS show generalized muscle weakness and fatigue, as well as ventroflexion of the head and neck, head bobbing, and scapulae protrusion.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They include three independent religious orders for men (the Order of Friars Minor being the largest contemporary male order), an order for nuns known as the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis, a religious and secular group open to male and female members. \nFranciscans adhere to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary. Several smaller Protestant Franciscan orders have been established since the late 19th century as well, particularly in the Lutheran and Anglican traditions. Certain Franciscan communities are ecumenical in nature, having members who belong to several Christian denominations.\nFrancis began preaching around 1207 and traveled to Rome to seek approval from Pope Innocent III in 1209 to form a religious order. The original Rule of Saint Francis approved by the pope did not allow ownership of property, requiring members of the order to beg for food while preaching. The austerity was meant to emulate the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. Franciscans traveled and preached in the streets, while staying in church properties. Clare, under Francis's guidance, founded the Poor Clares (Order of Saint Clare) of the Franciscans.\nThe extreme poverty required of members was relaxed in the final revision of the rule in 1223. The degree of observance required of members remained a major source of conflict within the order, resulting in numerous secessions. The Order of Friars Minor, previously known as the \"Observant\" branch, is one of the three Franciscan First Orders within the Catholic Church, the others being the \"Conventuals\", formed in 1517, and the \"Capuchins\", founded in 1520. \nThe Order of Friars Minor in its current form is the result of an amalgamation of several smaller orders completed in 1897 by Pope Leo XIII. The Capuchins and Conventuals remain distinct religious institutes within the Catholic Church, observing the Rule of Saint Francis with different emphases. Conventual Franciscans are sometimes referred to as minorites or greyfriars because of their habit. In Poland and Lithuania they are known as Bernardines, after Bernardino of Siena, although the term elsewhere refers to Cistercians instead. \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nName and demographics.\nThe name of the original order, (Friars Minor, literally 'Order of Lesser Brothers') stems from Francis of Assisi's rejection of luxury and wealth. Francis was the son of a rich cloth merchant but gave up his wealth to pursue his faith more fully. He had cut all ties that remained with his family and pursued a life living in solidarity with his fellow brothers in Christ. \nIn other words, he abandoned his life among the wealthy and aristocratic classes (or \"majori\") to live like the poor and peasants (\"minori\"). Francis adopted the simple tunic worn by peasants as the religious habit for his order and had others who wished to join him do the same. Those who joined him became the original Order of Friars Minor.\nFirst Order.\nThe First Order or the Order of Friars Minor, or Seraphic Order are commonly called simply the Franciscans. This order is a mendicant religious order of men, some of whom trace their origin to Francis of Assisi. Their official Latin name is the . Francis thus referred to his followers as \"Fraticelli\", meaning \"Little Brothers\". Franciscan brothers are informally called friars or the Minorites.\nThe modern organization of the Friars Minor comprises three separate families or groups, each considered a religious order in its own right under its own minister general and particular type of governance. They all live according to a body of regulations known as the Rule of Saint Francis.\nSecond Order.\nThe Second Order, most commonly called Poor Clares in English-speaking countries, consists of one branch of religious sisters. The order is called the Order of St. Clare (OSC). Prior to 1263 they were called \"The Poor Ladies\", \"The Poor Enclosed Nuns\", and \"The Order of San Damiano\".\nThird Order.\nThe Franciscan third order, known as the Third Order of Saint Francis, has many men and women members, separated into two main branches:\nMembership.\nThe 2013 gave the following figures for the membership of the principal male Franciscan orders:.\nThe coat of arms that is a universal symbol of Franciscan \"contains the Tau cross, with two crossed arms: Christ's right hand with the nail wound and Francis' left hand with the stigmata wound.\"\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nIn 1209, a sermon Francis heard on made such an impression on him that he decided to devote himself wholly to a life of apostolic poverty. Clad in a rough garment, barefoot, and, after the evangelical precept, without staff or scrip, he began to preach repentance.\nHe was soon joined by a prominent fellow townsman, Bernard of Quintavalle, who contributed all that he had to the work. Other companions joined, with Francis having 11 companions within a year. The brothers lived in the deserted leper colony of Rivo Torto near Assisi. They spent much of their time traveling through the mountainous districts of Umbria, always cheerful and full of songs, making a deep impression on their hearers by their earnest exhortations. Their life was extremely ascetic. Probably as early as 1209, Francis gave them a first rule, a collection of Scriptural passages emphasizing the duty of poverty.\nIn spite of some similarities between this principle and some of the fundamental ideas of the followers of Peter Waldo, the brotherhood of Assisi succeeded in gaining the approval of Pope Innocent III. What seems to have impressed first the Bishop of Assisi, then Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo and finally Innocent, was their utter loyalty to the Catholic Church and the clergy. Pope Innocent was responsible for helping to construct the church Francis was being called to rebuild. Innocent and the Fourth Lateran Council helped maintain the church in Europe.\nPope Innocent probably saw in them a possible answer to his desire for an orthodox preaching force to counter heresy. Many legends have clustered around the decisive audience of Francis with the pope. The realistic account in Matthew Paris\u2014according to which the pope originally sent the shabby saint off to keep swine and only recognized his real worth by his ready obedience\u2014has, in spite of its improbability, a certain historical interest since it shows the natural antipathy of the older Benedictine monasticism to the plebeian mendicant orders. The group was tonsured, and Francis was ordained as a deacon, allowing him to proclaim Gospel passages and preach in churches during Mass.\nFrancis's last years.\nin 1219, after intense apostolic activity in Italy, Francis went to Egypt with the Fifth Crusade to announce the Gospel to the Saracens. He met with the Sultan Malik al-Kamil, initiating a spirit of dialogue and understanding between Christianity and Islam. The Franciscan presence in the Holy Land started in 1217, when the province of Syria was established, with Brother Elias as minister. By 1229, the friars had a small house near the fifth station of the Via Dolorosa. In 1272, Sultan Baibars allowed the Franciscans to settle in the Cenacle on Mount Zion.\nIn 1309, they also settled in the Holy Sepulchre and in Bethlehem. In 1335, the king of Naples Robert of Anjou () and his wife Sancha of Majorca () bought the Cenacle and gave it to the Franciscans. In 1342, Pope Clement VI by the Bulls \"Gratias agimus\" and \"Nuper charissimae\", declared the Franciscans as the official custodians of the Holy Places in the name of the Catholic Church. The Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land is still in force today.\nThe controversy about how to follow the Gospel life of poverty, which extends through the first three centuries of Franciscan history, began in Francis' lifetime. The ascetic brothers Matthew of Narni and Gregory of Naples, a nephew of Cardinal Ugolino, were the two vicars-general to whom Francis had entrusted the direction of the order during his time in Egypt. They carried through at a chapter which they held certain stricter regulations in regard to fasting and the reception of alms, which departed from the spirit of the original rule. It did not take Francis long, on his return, to suppress this insubordinate tendency. \nHe was less successful in regard to another of an opposite nature which soon came up. Elias of Cortona originated a movement for the increase of the worldly consideration of the order and the adaptation of its system to the plans of the hierarchy. This conflicted with the original notions of Francis and helped to bring about the successive changes in the rule already described. Francis was not alone in opposition to this lax and secularizing tendency. On the contrary, the party which clung to his original views and after his death took his \"testament\" for their guide, known as Observantists or , was at least equal in numbers and activity to the followers of Elias.\nIn 1219, exasperated by the demands of running a growing and fractious order, Francis asked Pope Honorius III for help. He was assigned Cardinal Ugolino as protector of the order by the pope. Francis resigned the day-to-day running of the order. Francis retained the power to shape legislation, writing a rule in 1221 which he revised and had approved in 1223. After about 1221, the day-to-day running of the order was in the hands of Brother Elias of Cortona, who was elected as leader of the friars a few years after Francis's death in 1232 but who aroused much opposition because of his autocratic leadership style. He planned and built the Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi in which Francis is buried, a building which includes the friary Sacro Convento, still today the spiritual centre of the order. \nIn the external successes of the brothers, as they were reported at the yearly general chapters, there was much to encourage Francis. Caesar of Speyer, the first German provincial, a zealous advocate of the founder's strict principle of poverty, began in 1221 from Augsburg with 25 companions, to win for the order in the region of the Rhine and the Danube. In 1224, Agnellus of Pisa led a small group of friars to England. The branch arriving in England became known as the \"greyfriars\". Beginning at Greyfriars at Canterbury, the ecclesiastical capital, they moved on to London, the political capital, and Oxford, the intellectual capital. From these three bases, the Franciscans swiftly expanded, to embrace the principal towns of England.\nDevelopment after Francis's death.\n1232\u20131239.\nElias was a lay friar, and encouraged other laymen to enter the order. This brought opposition from many ordained friars and ministers provincial, who also opposed increased centralization of the Order. Gregory IX declared his intention to build a splendid church to house the body of Francis and the task fell to Elias, who at once began to lay plans for the erection of a great basilica at Assisi, to enshrine the remains of the \"Poverello\". In order to build the basilica, Elias proceeded to collect money in various ways to meet the expenses of the building. Elias thus also alienated the zealots in the order, who felt this was not in keeping with the founder's views upon the question of poverty.\nThe earliest leader of the strict party was Brother Leo, a close companion of Francis during his last years and the author of the , a strong polemic against the laxer party. Having protested against the collection of money for the erection of the basilica of San Francesco, it was Leo who broke in pieces the marble box which Elias had set up for offertories for the completion of the basilica at Assisi. For this Elias had him scourged, and this outrage on St Francis's dearest disciple consolidated the opposition to Elias. Leo was the leader in the early stages of the struggle in the order for the maintenance of St Francis's ideas on strict poverty. At the chapter held in May 1227, Elias was rejected in spite of his prominence, and Giovanni Parenti, Minister Provincial of Spain, was elected Minister General of the order.\nIn 1232 Elias succeeded him, and under him the Order significantly developed its ministries and presence in the towns. Many new houses were founded, especially in Italy, and in many of them special attention was paid to education. The somewhat earlier settlements of Franciscan teachers at the universities (in Paris, for example, where Alexander of Hales was teaching) continued to develop. Contributions toward the promotion of the Order's work, and especially the building of the Basilica in Assisi, came in abundantly. Funds could only be accepted on behalf of the friars for determined, imminent, real necessities that could not be provided for from begging. When in 1230, the General Chapter could not agree on a common interpretation of the 1223 Rule it sent a delegation including Anthony of Padua to Pope Gregory\u00a0IX for an authentic interpretation of this piece of papal legislation. The bull of Gregory\u00a0IX declared that the Testament of St.\u00a0Francis was not legally binding and offered an interpretation of poverty that would allow the Order to continue to develop. Gregory\u00a0IX authorized agents of the Order to have custody of such funds where they could not be spent immediately. Elias pursued with great severity the principal leaders of the opposition, and even Bernardo di Quintavalle, the founder's first disciple, was obliged to conceal himself for years in the forest of Monte Sefro.\nThe conflict between the two parties lasted many years and the won several notable victories in spite of the favor shown to their opponents by the papal administration, until finally the reconciliation of the two points of view was seen to be impossible and the order was actually split into halves.\n1239\u20131274.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nElias governed the Order from the center, imposing his authority on the provinces (as had Francis). A reaction to this centralized government was led from the provinces of England and Germany. At the general chapter of 1239, held in Rome under the personal presidency of Gregory IX, Elias was deposed in favor of Albert of Pisa, the former provincial of England, a moderate Observantist. This chapter introduced General Statutes to govern the Order and devolved power from the Minister General to the Ministers Provincial sitting in chapter. The next two Ministers General, Haymo of Faversham (1240\u20131244) and Crescentius of Jesi (1244\u20131247), consolidated this greater democracy in the Order but also led the Order towards a greater clericalization. The new Pope Innocent IV supported them in this. In a bull of November 14, 1245, this pope even sanctioned an extension of the system of financial agents, and allowed the funds to be used not simply for those things that were necessary for the friars but also for those that were useful.\nThe Observantist party took a strong stand in opposition to this ruling and agitated so successfully against the lax General that in 1247, at a chapter held in Lyon, France\u2014where Innocent IV was then residing\u2014he was replaced by the strict Observantist John of Parma (1247\u20131257) and the Order refused to implement any provisions of Innocent IV that were laxer than those of Gregory IX.\nElias, who had been excommunicated and taken under the protection of Frederick II, was now forced to give up all hope of recovering his power in the Order. He died in 1253, after succeeding by recantation in obtaining the removal of his censures. Under John of Parma, who enjoyed the favor of Innocent IV and Pope Alexander IV, the influence of the Order was notably increased, especially by the provisions of the latter pope in regard to the academic activity of the brothers. He not only sanctioned the theological institutes in Franciscan houses, but did all he could to support the friars in the Mendicant Controversy, when the secular Masters of the University of Paris and the Bishops of France combined to attack the mendicant orders. It was due to the action of Alexander IV's envoys, who were obliged to threaten the university authorities with excommunication, that the degree of doctor of theology was finally conceded to the Dominican Thomas Aquinas and the Franciscan Bonaventure (1257), who had previously been able to lecture only as licentiates.\nThe Franciscan Gerard of Borgo San Donnino at this time issued a Joachimite tract and John of Parma was seen as favoring the condemned theology of Joachim of Fiore. To protect the Order from its enemies, John was forced to step down and recommended Bonaventure as his successor. Bonaventure saw the need to unify the Order around a common ideology and both wrote a new life of the founder and collected the Order's legislation into the Constitutions of Narbonne, so called because they were ratified by the Order at its chapter held at Narbonne, France, in 1260. In the chapter of Pisa three years later Bonaventure's was approved as the only biography of Francis and all previous biographies were ordered to be destroyed. Bonaventure ruled (1257\u20131274) in a moderate spirit, which is represented also by various works produced by the order in his time\u00a0\u2013 especially by the written by David of Augsburg soon after 1260.\n14th century.\n1274\u20131300.\nThe successor to Bonaventure, Jerome of Ascoli or Girolamo Masci (1274\u20131279), (the future Pope Nicholas\u00a0IV), and his successor, Bonagratia of Bologna (1279\u20131285), also followed a middle course. Severe measures were taken against certain extreme Spirituals who, on the strength of the rumor that Pope Gregory\u00a0X was intending at the Council of Lyon (1274\u20131275) to force the mendicant orders to tolerate the possession of property, threatened both pope and council with the renunciation of allegiance. Attempts were made, however, to satisfy the reasonable demands of the Spiritual party, as in the bull \"Exiit qui seminat\" of Pope Nicholas\u00a0III (1279), which pronounced the principle of complete poverty to be meritorious and holy, but interpreted it in the way of a somewhat sophistical distinction between possession and usufruct. The bull was received respectfully by Bonagratia and the next two generals, Arlotto of Prato (1285\u20131287) and Matthew of Aqua Sparta (1287\u20131289); but the Spiritual party under the leadership of the Bonaventuran pupil and apocalyptic Pierre Jean Olivi regarded its provisions for the dependence of the friars upon the pope and the division between brothers occupied in manual labor and those employed on spiritual missions as a corruption of the fundamental principles of the Order. They were not won over by the conciliatory attitude of the next general, Raymond Gaufredi (1289\u20131296), and of the Franciscan Pope Nicholas\u00a0IV (1288\u20131292). The attempt made by the next pope, Celestine V, an old friend of the order, to end the strife by uniting the Observantist party with his own order of hermits (see Celestines) was scarcely more successful. Only a part of the Spirituals joined the new order, and the secession scarcely lasted beyond the reign of the hermit-pope. Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII annulled Celestine's bull of foundation with his other acts, deposed the general Raymond Gaufredi, and appointed a man of laxer tendency, John de Murro, in his place. The Benedictine section of the Celestines was separated from the Franciscan section, and the latter was formally suppressed by Pope Boniface\u00a0VIII in 1302. The leader of the Observantists, Olivi, who spent his last years in the Franciscan house at Tarnius and died there in 1298, had pronounced against the extremer \"Spiritual\" attitude, and given an exposition of the theory of poverty which was approved by the more moderate Observantists, and for a long time constituted their principle.\nPersecution.\nUnder Pope Clement V (1305\u20131314) this party succeeded in exercising some influence on papal decisions. In 1309, Clement had a commission sit at Avignon for the purpose of reconciling the conflicting parties. Ubertino of Casale, the leader, after Olivi's death, of the stricter party, who was a member of the commission, induced the Council of Vienne to arrive at a decision in the main favoring his views. The 1313 papal constitution was on the whole conceived in the same sense. \nClement's successor, Pope John XXII (1316\u20131334), favored the laxer or conventual party. By the bull he modified several provisions of the constitution , and required the formal submission of the Spirituals. Some of them, encouraged by the strongly Observantist general Michael of Cesena, ventured to dispute the pope's right so to deal with the provisions of his predecessor. Sixty-four of them were summoned to Avignon and the most obstinate delivered over to the Inquisition, four of them being burned in 1318. Shortly before this, all the separate houses of the Observantists had been suppressed.\nRenewed controversy on the question of poverty.\nA few years later a new controversy, this time theoretical, broke out on the question of poverty. In his 14 August 1279 bull , Pope Nicholas III had confirmed the arrangement already established by Pope Innocent IV, by which all property given to the Franciscans was vested in the Holy See, which granted the friars the mere use of it. The bull declared that renunciation of ownership of all things \"both individually but also in common, for God's sake, is meritorious and holy; Christ, also, showing the way of perfection, taught it by word and confirmed it by example, and the first founders of the church militant, as they had drawn it from the fountainhead itself, distributed it through the channels of their teaching and life to those wishing to live perfectly.\"\nAlthough \"Exiit qui seminat\" banned disputing about its contents, the decades that followed saw increasingly bitter disputes about the form of poverty to be observed by Franciscans, with the Spirituals (so called because associated with the Age of the Spirit that Joachim of Fiore had said would begin in 1260) pitched against the Conventual Franciscans. Pope Clement V's bull of 20 November 1312 failed to effect a compromise between the two factions. Clement V's successor, Pope John XXII was determined to suppress what he considered to be the excesses of the Spirituals, who contended eagerly for the view that Christ and his apostles had possessed absolutely nothing, either separately or jointly, and who were citing in support of their view. \nIn 1317, John XXII formally condemned the group of them known as the Fraticelli. On 26 March 1322, with , he removed the ban on discussion of Nicholas III's bull and commissioned experts to examine the idea of poverty based on belief that Christ and the apostles owned nothing. The experts disagreed among themselves, but the majority condemned the idea on the grounds that it would condemn the church's right to have possessions. The Franciscan chapter held in Perugia in May 1322 declared on the contrary: \"To say or assert that Christ, in showing the way of perfection, and the Apostles, in following that way and setting an example to others who wished to lead the perfect life, possessed nothing either severally or in common, either by right of ownership and or by personal right, we corporately and unanimously declare to be not heretical, but true and catholic.\" \nBy the bull of 8 December 1322, John XXII, declaring it ridiculous to pretend that every scrap of food given to the friars and eaten by them belonged to the pope, refused to accept ownership over the goods of the Franciscans in the future and granted them exemption from the rule that absolutely forbade ownership of anything even in common, thus forcing them to accept ownership. And, on 12 November 1323, he issued the short bull which declared \"erroneous and heretical\" the doctrine that Christ and his apostles had no possessions whatever. John XXII's actions thus demolished the fictitious structure that gave the appearance of absolute poverty to the life of the Franciscan friars.\nInfluential members of the order protested, such as the minister general Michael of Cesena, the English provincial William of Ockham, and Bonagratia of Bergamo. In 1324, Louis the Bavarian sided with the Spirituals and accused the pope of heresy. In reply to the argument of his opponents that Nicholas III's bull was fixed and irrevocable, John XXII issued the bull on 10 November 1324 in which he declared that it cannot be inferred from the words of the 1279 bull that Christ and the apostles had nothing, adding: \"Indeed, it can be inferred rather that the Gospel life lived by Christ and the Apostles did not exclude some possessions in common, since living 'without property' does not require that those living thus should have nothing in common.\" In 1328, Michael of Cesena was summoned to Avignon to explain the Order's intransigence in refusing the pope's orders and its complicity with Louis of Bavaria. Michael was imprisoned in Avignon, together with Francesco d'Ascoli, Bonagratia, and William of Ockham. In January of that year Louis of Bavaria entered Rome and had himself crowned emperor. Three months later he declared John XXII deposed and installed the Spiritual Franciscan Pietro Rainalducci as antipope. The Franciscan chapter that opened in Bologna on 28 May reelected Michael of Cesena, who two days before had escaped with his companions from Avignon. But in August Louis the Bavarian and his pope had to flee Rome before an attack by Robert, King of Naples. Only a small part of the Franciscan Order joined the opponents of John XXII, and at a general chapter held in Paris in 1329 the majority of all the houses declared their submission to the Pope. With the bull of 16 November 1329, John XXII replied to Michael of Cesena's attacks on , , and . In 1330, Antipope Nicholas V submitted, followed later by the ex-general Michael, and finally, just before his death, by Ockham.\nSeparate congregations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOut of all these dissensions in the 14th century sprang a number of separate congregations, or almost sects, to say nothing of the heretical parties of the Beghards and Fraticelli, some of which developed within the Order on both hermit and cenobitic principles and may here be mentioned:\nClareni.\nThe Clareni or Clarenini was an association of hermits established on the river Clareno in the march of Ancona by Angelo da Clareno (1337). Like several other smaller congregations, it was obliged in 1568 under Pope Pius V to unite with the general body of Observantists.\nMinorites of Narbonne.\nAs a separate congregation, this originated through the union of a number of houses which followed Olivi after 1308. It was limited to southwestern France and, its members being accused of the heresy of the Beghards, was suppressed by the Inquisition during the controversies under John XXII.\nReform of Johannes de Vallibus.\nThis was founded in the hermitage of St. Bartholomew at Brugliano near Foligno in 1334. The congregation was suppressed by the Franciscan general chapter in 1354; reestablished in 1368 by Paolo de' Trinci of Foligno; confirmed by Gregory XI in 1373, and spread rapidly from Central Italy to France, Spain, Hungary, and elsewhere. Most of the Observantist houses joined this congregation by degrees, so that it became known simply as the \"brothers of the regular Observance.\" \nIt acquired the favor of the popes by its energetic opposition to the heretical Fraticelli, and was expressly recognized by the 1415 Council of Constance. It was allowed to have a special vicar-general of its own and legislate for its members without reference to the conventual part of the Order. Through the work of such men as Bernardino of Siena, Giovanni da Capistrano, and Dietrich Coelde (b. 1435? at Munster; was a member of the Brethren of the Common Life, died December 11, 1515), it gained great prominence during the 15th century. By the end of the Middle Ages, the Observantists, with 1,400 houses, comprised nearly half of the entire Order. \nTheir influence brought about attempts at reform even among the Conventuals, including the quasi-Observantist brothers living under the rule of the Conventual ministers (Martinianists or \"Observantes sub ministris\"), such as the male Colletans, later led by Boniface de Ceva in his reform attempts principally in France and Germany; the reformed congregation founded in 1426 by the Spaniard Philip de Berbegal and distinguished by the special importance they attached to the little hood (); the Neutri, a group of reformers originating about 1463 in Italy, who tried to take a middle ground between the Conventuals and Observantists, but refused to obey the heads of either, until they were compelled by the pope to affiliate with the regular Observantists, or with those of the Common Life; the Caperolani, a congregation founded about 1470 in North Italy by Peter Caperolo, but dissolved again on the death of its founder in 1481; the Amadeists, founded by the noble Portuguese Amadeo, who entered the Franciscan order at Assisi in 1452, gathered around him a number of adherents to his fairly strict principles (numbering finally twenty-six houses), and died in the odor of sanctity in 1482.\nUnification.\nProjects for a union between the two main branches of the Order were put forth not only by the Council of Constance but by several popes, without any positive result. By direction of Pope Martin V, John of Capistrano drew up statutes which were to serve as a basis for reunion, and they were actually accepted by a general chapter at Assisi in 1430; but the majority of the Conventual houses refused to agree to them, and they remained without effect. At John of Capistrano's request Eugene IV issued a bull (, 1446) aimed at the same result, but again nothing was accomplished. \nEqually unsuccessful were the attempts of the Franciscan Pope Sixtus IV, who bestowed a vast number of privileges on both of the original mendicant orders, but by this very fact lost the favor of the Observants and failed in his plans for reunion. Julius II succeeded in reducing some of the smaller branches, but left the division of the two great parties untouched. This division was legalized by Leo X, after a general chapter held in Rome in 1517, in connection with the reform-movement of the Fifth Lateran Council, had once more declared the impossibility of reunion. The less strict principles of the Conventuals, permitting the possession of real estate and the enjoyment of fixed revenues, were recognized as tolerable, while the Observants, in contrast to this , were held strictly to their own or \"pauper\".\nAll of the groups that followed the Franciscan Rule literally were united to the Observants, and the right to elect the Minister General of the Order, together with the seal of the Order, was given to this united grouping. This grouping, since it adhered more closely to the rule of the founder, was allowed to claim a certain superiority over the Conventuals. The Observant general, elected now for six years, not for life, inherited the title of \"Minister-General of the Whole Order of St. Francis\". He was granted the right to confirm the choice of a head for the Conventuals, who was known as \"Master-General of the Friars Minor Conventual\"\u2014although this privilege never became practically operative.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFranciscans and the Inquisition.\nIn about 1236 during the time of Elias of Cortona, Pope Gregory IX appointed the Franciscans, along with the Dominicans, as Inquisitors. The Franciscans had been involved in anti-heretical activities from the beginning simply by preaching and acting as living examples of the Gospel life. As official Inquisitors, they were authorized to use torture to extract confessions, as approved by Pope Innocent IV in 1252 while John of Parma was General Minister. The Franciscans were involved in the torture and trials of Jews, Muslims, and other heretics throughout the Middle Ages and wrote their own manuals to guide Inquisitors, such as the 14th century \"Codex Casanatensis\" for use by Inquisitors in Tuscany. \nAs well as acting as prosecutors, many friars, particularly those associated with the Spiritual Franciscans and even some Observants, were also subject to interrogation and prosecution by the Inquisition at various stages in the 13th and 14th centuries. Notable cases from the Spirituals include Angelo da Clareno and Bernard D\u00e9licieux. Notable examples of Observants include the four burned during the suppression of the Observant houses in 1318 mentioned above. \n The Inquisition spread to the new world during the Age of Discovery to root out heretics, leading further persecution and execution (e.g., Mexican Inquisition).\nNew World missions.\nThe work of the Franciscans in New Spain began in 1523, when three Flemish friars\u2014Juan de Ayora, Pedro de Tecto, and Pedro de Gante\u2014reached the central highlands. Their impact as missionaries was limited at first, since two of them died on Cort\u00e9s's expedition to Central America in 1524, but Fray Pedro de Gante initiated the evangelization process and studied the Nahuatl language through his contacts with children of the Indian elite from the city of Tetzcoco. \nIn May 1524, the Twelve Apostles of Mexico arrived, led by Mart\u00edn de Valencia. There they built the Convento Grande de San Francisco, which became Franciscan headquarters for New Spain for the next three hundred years.\nContemporary organizations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFirst Order.\nOrder of Friars Minor.\nThe Order of Friars Minor (OFM) has 1,500 houses in about 100 provinces and , with about 16,000 members. In 1897, Pope Leo XIII combined the Observants, Discalced (Alcantarines), Recollects, and Riformati into one order under general constitutions. While the Capuchins and Conventuals wanted the reunited Observants to be referred to as The Order of Friars Minor of the Leonine Union, they were instead called simply the Order of Friars Minor. Despite the tensions caused by this forced union, the Order grew from 1897 to reach a peak of 26,000 members in the 1960s before declining after the 1970s. The Order is headed by a Minister General, who since July 2021 is Father Massimo Fusarelli.\nOrder of Friars Minor Conventual.\nThe Order of Friars Minor Conventual (OFM Conv.) consists of 290 houses worldwide, with a total of almost 5,000 friars. They have experienced growth in this century throughout the world. They are located in Italy, the United States, Canada, Australia, and throughout Latin America, and Africa. They are the largest in number in Poland because of the work and inspiration of Maximilian Kolbe.\nOrder of Friars Minor Capuchin.\nThe Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (OFM Cap.) are the youngest branch of Franciscans, founded in 1525 by Matteo Serafini (Matteo Bassi, Matteo da Bascio), an Observant friar, who felt himself called to an even stricter observance of Franciscan austerity. With the support of the Papal Court, the new branch received early recognition and grew fast, first in Italy and after 1574 all over Europe and throughout the world. The Capuchins eventually became a separate order in 1619. \nThe name Capuchins refers to the particular shape of the long hood or . Originally a popular nickname, it has become a part of the official name of the order. The order now exists in 106 countries all over the world, with around 10,500 brothers living in more than 1,700 communities, known as fraternities, or friaries.\nSecond Order.\nPoor Clares.\nThe Poor Clares, officially the Order of Saint Clare, are members of a contemplative order of nuns in the Catholic Church. The Poor Clares were the second Franciscan order to be established. Founded by Clare of Assisi and Francis of Assisi on Palm Sunday in 1212, they were organized after the Order of Friars Minor (the first order), and before the Third Order of Saint Francis. In 2011, there were over 20,000 Poor Clare nuns in over 75 countries throughout the world. They follow several different observances and are organized into federations.\nThe Poor Clares follow the \"Rule of St. Clare\" which was approved by Pope Innocent IV the day before Clare's death in 1253. The main branch of the Order (OSC) follows the observance of Pope Urban. Other branches established since that time, who operate under their own unique constitutions, are the Colettine Poor Clares (PCC \u2013 founded 1410), the Capuchin Poor Clares (OSC Cap. \u2013 founded 1538), and the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration (PCPA \u2013 founded 1854).\nThird Order.\nThe Third Order of Saint Francis comprises people who desired to grow in holiness in their daily lives without entering monastic life. After founding the Friars Minor and seeing a need, Francis created a way of life to which married men and women, as well as the single and the secular clergy, could belong and live according to the Gospel. \nSecular Franciscan Order.\nThe Secular Franciscan Order, prior to 1978 also known as the Third Order Secular of Saint Francis, is an order founded by Francis in 1212 for brothers and sisters who do not live in a religious community. Members of the order continue to live secular lives, and gather regularly for fraternal activities. In the United States alone there are 17,000 professed members of the order. \nMembers of the Order live according to a Rule composed by St Francis in 1221. The Rule was slightly modified through the centuries and was replaced at the turn of the 20th century by Pope Leo XIII, himself a member of the Order. A new and current Rule was approved by Pope Paul VI in 1978, and the Third Order was renamed the Secular Franciscan Order. It is an international organization with its own Minister General based in Rome.\nThird Order Regular.\nWithin a century of the death of Francis, members of the Third Order began to live in common, in an attempt to follow a more ascetical way of life. Angela of Foligno (+1309) was foremost among those who achieved great depths in their lives of prayer and service of the poor, while living in community with other women of the Order.\nAmong the men, the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance was formed in 1447 by a papal decree that united several communities of hermits, following the Third Order Rule, into a single Order, with its own Minister General. Today it is an international community of friars who desire to emphasize the works of mercy and on-going conversion. The community is also known as the Franciscan Friars, TOR, and they strive to \"rebuild the Church\" in areas of high school and college education, parish ministry, church renewal, social justice, campus ministry, hospital chaplaincies, foreign missions, and other ministries in places where the church is needed. \nThe association of Franciscans (Grey Friars) with education became a stock fictional reference in, for example, the works of Thackeray (\"Grey Friars School\" in \"Pendennis\" and \"The Newcomes\") or of \"Frank Richards\" (Greyfriars School of Billy Bunter fame).\nAfter the formal recognition of the members of religious tertiary communities, the following centuries saw a steady growth of such communities across Europe. Initially, the women's communities took a monastic form of life, either voluntarily or under pressure from ecclesiastical superiors. The great figure of this development was Hyacintha Mariscotti. As Europe entered the upheavals of the modern age, new communities arose which were able to focus more exclusively on social service, especially during the immediate post-Napoleonic period which devastated much of Western Europe. An example of this is Mary Frances Schervier (1819\u20131876).\nThird Order Regular in North America.\nThis movement continued in North America as congregations arose from one coast to another, in answer to the needs of the large emigrant communities that were flooding the cities of the United States and Canada.\nThe Third Order Regular of the Brothers of the Poor of St. Francis of Assisi, CFP, are an active community, based in the United States, with houses in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and Brazil. These Franciscans strive to live an integrated life through prayer, community, and ministry to the poor, neglected and disadvantaged youth, the powerless, people in need, and the elderly. The Brothers of the Poor live by their vows of poverty (living a simple lifestyle), consecrated chastity (loving all, possessing no one, striving sincerely, for singleness of heart, a celibate way of loving and being loved), and obedience (to God, to the community, to the church, and to self). \nThe Brothers of the Poor serve persons with AIDS and people who ask for help, regardless of their religion or their social/economic background. They are teachers, childcare workers, social workers, counselors, pastoral ministers, retreat ministers, religious educators, and school administrators, along with other tasks.\nThe Regular Tertiaries, officially the Third Order Regular of St. Francis of Penance, who operate the Franciscan University of Steubenville, follow a rule approved by Pope Leo X. Today this group is present in 17 countries: Italy, Croatia, Spain, France, Germany, Austria, US, India, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Brazil, Paraguay, Mexico, Peru, Sweden, Bangladesh, and the Philippines.\nBrothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis.\nThe Brothers and Sisters of Penance of St. Francis, is a private confraternity of the Catholic Church, whose members strive to model their lives according to the Rule and Statutes of the Primitive Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis, which was written for lay people in 1221 by Francis of Assisi. Right now there are several hundred members within the United States and a few hundred more throughout the world. The order was started in 1996 by members of the Archdiocese of St. Paul in Minnesota.\nOther Christian traditions.\nThere are Franciscan orders in Lutheran Churches, including the Order of Lutheran Franciscans, the Evangelical Sisterhood of Mary, and the Evangelische Kanaan Franziskus-Bruderschaft (Kanaan Franciscan Brothers). Established in 2006, the Order of St. Francis-Lutheran (OSF-L) operates under the auspices of the Lutheran Church-International. The OSF-L is based in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. \nIn the United States, the Evangelical Society of the Cross Franciscan (the Lutheran Third Order of St. Francis) was founded in 1988 in Orlando, Florida. It was blessed by Bishop Lavern Franzen of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.\nOne of the results of the Oxford Movement in the Anglican Communion during the 19th century was the re-establishment of religious orders in the Church of England, including some of Franciscan inspiration. The principal Anglican communities in the Franciscan tradition are the Community of St. Francis (women, founded 1905) (CSF), the Poor Clares of Reparation (PCR), the Society of Saint Francis (men, founded 1934)(SSF), the Community of St. Clare (women, enclosed) (OSC), and the Order of St. Francis (men, founded in 2003). There is a Third Order known as the Third Order Society of St Francis (TSSF), and the Lesser Franciscans. There is an order of Sisters of St. Clare in the Puget Sound area of Washington state (Diocese of Olympia), the Little Sisters of St. Clare.\nThere are some small Franciscan communities within Continental Reformed Churches and the Old Catholic Church. \nThere are associations of Franciscan inspiration that describe themselves as ecumenical\u2014accepting Christians of all denominations, the Order of Ecumenical Franciscans being an example. The Companions of Francis Apostolic Religious Institute (CFARI), with its roots in independent Catholicism, is a dispersed, egalitarian and ecumenical order of Franciscans based in Pasadena, California, with vowed members in California, Arizona and New Mexico. CFARI members live among the populations they serve and are self supporting in their ministry.\nDistinguishing characteristics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpirituality.\nFranciscan theology conforms to broader doctrine with the Catholic Church, but involves several unique emphases. Franciscan theologians view creation, the natural world, as good and joyous, and avoid dwelling on the \"stain of original sin.\" Francis expressed great affection towards animals and inanimate natural objects as fellow inhabitants of God's creation, in his work \"Canticle of the Creatures\" (, also known as the \"Canticle of the Sun\"). \nSpecial emphasis is put on the Incarnation of Christ viewed as a special act of humility, as Francis was struck by God's great charity in sacrificing his son for the salvation of mankind. They also exhibit great devotion to the Eucharist. The Rule of Saint Francis calls for members to practice simple living and detachment from material possessions in emulation of Jesus' life and earthly ministry. The simple lifestyle helps members of the order, in whichever branch, to experience solidarity with the poor and to work for social justice. Franciscan spirituality also strongly emphasizes working to preserve the church, and remain loyal to it.\nVisions and stigmata.\nAmong Catholic religious, Franciscans have proportionally reported higher ratios of stigmata and have claimed proportionally higher ratios of visions of Jesus and Mary. Francis of Assisi himself was one of the first reported cases of stigmata, and perhaps the most famous stigmatic of modern times is Padre Pio, a Capuchin, who also reported visions of Jesus and Mary. Pio's stigmata persisted for over fifty years and he was examined by numerous physicians in the 20th century, who confirmed the existence of the wounds, but none of whom could produce a medical explanation for the fact that his bleeding wounds would never get infected. According to the \"Encyclopaedia Britannica\", his wounds healed once, but reappeared. \nAccording to the \"Columbia Encyclopedia\" some medical authorities who examined Padre Pio's wounds were inclined to believe that the stigmata were connected with nervous or cataleptic hysteria. According to Answers.com the wounds were examined by Luigi Romanelli, chief physician of the City Hospital of Barletta, for about one year. Giorgio Festa, a private practitioner examined them in 1920 and 1925. Giuseppe Bastianelli, a physician to Pope Benedict XV, agreed that the wounds existed but made no other comment. Pathologist Amico Bignami observed the wounds, but made no diagnosis.\nContributions to biblical scholarship.\nThe Franciscans established the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum as an academic society based in Jerusalem and Hong Kong for the study of scripture. The Hong Kong branch founded by Gabriele Allegra produced the first complete translation of the Catholic Bible in Chinese in 1968 after a 40-year effort. The Studium Biblicum Translation is often considered the authoritative Chinese Bible among Catholics.\nThe early efforts of another Franciscan, namely Giovanni di Monte Corvino who had attempted a first translation of the Bible in Beijing in the 14th century, provided the initial spark for Gabriele Allegra's 40 year undertaking, when at the age of 21 he happened to attend the 6th centenary celebration for Monte Corvino.\nNotable members.\nThe Franciscan order boasts a number of distinguished members. From its first century can be cited the three great scholastics Alexander of Hales, Bonaventure, and John Duns Scotus, the \"Doctor of Wonders\" Roger Bacon, and the well-known mystic authors and popular preachers David of Augsburg and Berthold of Regensburg.\nDuring the Middle Ages noteworthy members included Nicholas of Lyra, Biblical commentator Bernardino of Siena, philosopher William of Ockham, preachers John of Capistrano, Oliver Maillard, and Michel Menot, and historians Luke Wadding and Antoine Pagi.\nIn the field of Christian art during the later Middle Ages, the Franciscan movement exercised considerable influence, especially in Italy. The influence of Franciscan ideals shows in several great painters of the 13th and 14th centuries, especially Cimabue and Giotto, who, though they were not friars, were spiritual sons of Francis in the wider sense. It is also seen in the plastic masterpieces of Giotto, as well as the architectural conceptions of both himself and his school. The Italian Gothic style, whose earliest important monument is the great convent church at Assisi, built 1228\u20131253, was cultivated as a rule principally by members of the order or men under their influence.\nThe early spiritual poetry of Italy was partially inspired by Francis himself, who was followed by Thomas of Celano, Bonaventure, and Jacopone da Todi. Through a tradition which held him to have been a member of the Franciscan Third Order, even Dante may be included within this artistic tradition, cf. especially \"Paradiso\", xi. 50.\nOther famous members of the Franciscan family include Anthony of Padua, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais, Alexander of Hales, Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, Pio of Pietrelcina, Maximilian Kolbe, Pasquale Sarullo, Mamerto Esqui\u00fa, Gabriele Allegra, Junipero Serra, Simpliciano of the Nativity, Mychal F. Judge, Angelico Chavez, Anton Docher, Joseph of Cupertino, Benedict Groeschel and Leonard of Port Maurice.\nDuring the \"spiritual conquest\" of New Spain, 1523\u20131572, the arrival of the first group of Franciscans, the Twelve Apostles of Mexico, included Mart\u00edn de Valencia, but more prominently for his corpus of writings on the earliest years was Toribio de Benavente Motolinia. Other important Franciscans are Alonso de Molina, Andr\u00e9s de Olmos, and Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, who all created texts in indigenous language of Nahuatl to aid friars in the evangelization of Mexico. Geronimo de Mendieta, Augustin de Vetancourt, and Juan de Torquemada are important contributors to the history of the Franciscans in central Mexico.\nA modern notable member is Casey Cole, an American Franciscan friar, Catholic priest, writer, and blogger. Cole runs his own online blog and YouTube channel called \"Breaking in the Habit\" and is the author of the books \"Let Go: Seven Stumbling Blocks to Christian Discipleship\" and \"Called: What Happens After Saying Yes to God\".\nPublications.\nThe UK Franciscan Order manages the website \" https://www.franciscanpublishing.com/about-us/\".\nPreviously, the Franciscan International Study Centre was established in Canterbury in 1973 and closed its doors in 2017.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nBooks\nArticles"}

He has received several accolades, including nominations for an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, three Golden Globe Awards, two Tony Awards and one Volpi Cup. With a film career spanning more than forty years, Neeson is regarded as one of Ireland's greatest film actors. Films in which he has appeared have grossed over $11.7 billion worldwide. Neeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000.\nNeeson made his film debut in 1978 with \"Pilgrim's Progress\" followed by early roles in \"Excalibur\" (1981), \"The Bounty\" (1984), \"The Mission\" (1986), \"The Dead Pool\" (1988), and \"Husbands and Wives\" (1992). He rose to prominence portraying Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's Holocaust drama \"Schindler's List\" (1993) for which he earned an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination. He played leading man roles in drama films such as \"Nell\" (1994), \"Rob Roy\" (1995), \"Michael Collins\" (1996), and \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (1998). He took blockbuster roles portraying Qui-Gon Jinn in \"\" (1999), Ra's al Ghul in \"Batman Begins\" (2005), and Aslan in \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" trilogy (2005\u20132010).\nNeeson acted in films such as the historical drama \"Gangs of New York\" (2002), the romantic comedy \"Love Actually\" (2003), the biographical drama \"Kinsey\" (2004), the erotic thriller \"Chloe\" (2009), the religious drama \"Silence\" (2016), the fantasy film \"A Monster Calls\" (2016), the crime thriller \"Widows\" (2018), the anthology film \"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\" (2018), and the romantic drama \"Ordinary Love\" (2019).

He portrayed Oscar Wilde in David Hare's \"The Judas Kiss\" (1998).\nEarly life and education.\nNeeson was born in Ballymena, County Antrim, the son of primary school caretaker Bernard \"Barney\" Neeson and cook Katherine \"Kitty\" Neeson (n\u00e9e Brown). His mother was born and raised in Waterford in the south-east of Ireland. Brought up Catholic, he was named Liam after a local priest. He has three sisters, Elizabeth, Bernadette, and Rosaleen. He attended St Patrick's College, Ballymena, from 1963 to 1967, and later recalled that his love of drama began there.\nHe said that growing up as a Catholic in a predominantly Protestant town made him cautious, and once said he felt like a \"second-class citizen\" there, but has also said he was never made to feel \"inferior or even different\" at the town's predominantly Protestant technical college. \"It would be colourful to imagine I had a rebellious, uproarious Irish background,\" he has said, \"but the facts were much greyer. Irish, yes. But all that nationalistic stuff, crying into your Guinness and singing rebel songs\u2014that was never my scene.\" He has described himself as \"out of touch\" with the politics and history of Northern Ireland until becoming aware of protests by fellow students after Bloody Sunday, a massacre in Derry in 1972 during the Troubles, which encouraged him to learn more local history. In a 2009 interview, he said, \"I never stop thinking about [the Troubles]. I've known guys and girls who have been perpetrators of violence and victims. Protestants and Catholics. It's part of my DNA.\"\nAt age nine, Neeson began boxing lessons at the All Saints Youth Club, and went on to win a number of regional titles before quitting at 17. He acted in school productions during his teens. His interest in acting and decision to become an actor were also influenced by Ian Paisley, founder of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), into whose Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster he sneaked. He said, \"[Paisley] had a magnificent presence and it was incredible to watch him just Bible-thumping away... it was acting, but it was also great acting and stirring too.\" In 1971, he joined a physics and computer science course at Queen's University Belfast before leaving to work for the Guinness Brewery. At Queen's, he discovered a talent for football and was spotted by Se\u00e1n Thomas at Bohemian FC. There was a club trial in Dublin and Neeson played one game as a substitute against Shamrock Rovers FC, but was not offered a contract.\nCareer.\n1976\u20131993: Rise to prominence.\nAfter leaving university, Neeson returned to Ballymena, where he worked in a variety of casual jobs, such as a forklift operator at Guinness and a lorry driver.

Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Warren Beatty had all expressed interest in the part. Beatty even auditioned, but Neeson was cast in December 1992. He had read Keneally's book and concluded that his character \"enjoyed fookin' [\"sic\"] with the Nazis. In Keneally's book, it says he was regarded as a kind of a buffoon by them... if the Nazis were New Yorkers, he was from Arkansas. They don't quite take him seriously, and he used that to full effect.\" His critically acclaimed performance earned him a nomination for a Best Actor Oscar and helped the film earn Best Picture of 1993. He also received BAFTA and Golden Globes nominations for the performance. \nIn 1993, Neeson made his Broadway debut playing Mat Burke in the revival of the Eugene O'Neill play \"Anna Christie\", starring opposite his \"Ellis Island\" co-star and future wife Natasha Richardson.

He starred alongside Uma Thurman, Geoffrey Rush, and Claire Danes. Writing of Neeson's performance, Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" wrote, \"[He] plays the role with the sure physical authority and profound decency that are fundamental to Valjean's character\" adding, \"With a first-rate cast and a venerable storytelling style, it fluently condenses Victor Hugo's epic novel and retrieves some of its suspenseful momentum.\" That same year, he returned to the stage in the David Hare play \"The Judas Kiss\" (1998), portraying Oscar Wilde which ran at both the Almeida Theatre in the West End and the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway. He acted alongside Tom Hollander and Peter Capaldi.

Director George Lucas cast Neeson because he considered him a \"master actor, who the other actors will look up to, who has got the qualities of strength that the character demands.\" As the first \"Star Wars\" film to be released in 16 years, it was surrounded by media anticipation. Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, the film was a box office success.\nNeeson's performance as Qui-Gon received positive reviews and a Saturn Award nomination.

The latter won awards at a number of film festivals, including Best Documentary from both the Chicago Film Critics Association and the National Board of Review. Neeson returned to Broadway in the revival of the Arthur Miller play \"The Crucible\" acting opposite Laura Linney. For his performance as John Proctor, he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Charles Isherwood of \"Variety\" praised Neeson writing, \"In his thoughtful performance as Proctor, the effortlessly charismatic Neeson subtly delineates a man\u2019s moral evolution as Proctor moves from casual scorn for the proceedings to outrage to soul-stricken despair\" adding, \"Perhaps the finest aspect of Neeson\u2019s performance is its admirable restraint\". That same year Neeson acted with Harrison Ford in Kathryn Bigelow's 2002 submarine thriller \"\" as Captain Mikhail Polenin. He was also in the cast of Martin Scorsese's historical drama \"Gangs of New York\" with Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Cameron Diaz.\nIn 2003, he played a recently widowed writer in Richard Curtis's romantic comedy ensemble \"Love Actually\" (2003), acting alongside Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Laura Linney.

Neeson voiced the main character's father, James, in the video game \"Fallout 3\". Executive producer Todd Howard said, \"This role was written with Liam in mind, and provides the dramatic tone for the entire game\". \"Fallout 3\", the third game in the Fallout series, was extremely well received by critics and shipped 4.7\u00a0million copies by the end of 2008, the year it was released.

In January 2015, he repeated his views, calling U.S. gun laws a \"disgrace\" in an interview with Emirati newspaper \"Gulf News\" when replying to a question about the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shootings earlier that month. In response, American gun manufacturer Para USA, which provided the prop weapons used by Neeson in the \"Taken\" film series, stated: \"We will no longer provide firearms for use in films starring Liam Neeson and ask that our friends and partners in Hollywood refrain from associating our brand and products with his projects.\"\nIn 2014, Neeson protested against the anti-carriage horse campaign of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who said he would outlaw horse-drawn carriages in Central Park once he took office.

He has to be accountable.\"\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and relationships.\nNeeson lived with actress Helen Mirren during the early 1980s. They met while working on \"Excalibur\" (1981).

They were married on 3 July 1994 and had two sons together, Miche\u00e1l (born 1995) and Daniel (born 1996). In October 1998, they won \u00a350,000 ($85,370) in libel damages after the \"Daily Mirror\" wrongly claimed that their marriage was suffering. They donated the money to victims of the August 1998 Omagh bombing. In August 2004, they purchased an estate in Millbrook, New York. On 18 March 2009, Richardson died when she suffered a traumatic brain injury in a skiing accident at the Mont Tremblant Resort, northwest of Montreal. Neeson donated her organs following her death.\nAfter Richardson's death, Neeson dated Freya St. Johnston for two years. He has not dated again since the split, stating in 2024 that he was \"past all of that\".\nHeritage and beliefs.\nNeeson holds Irish and American citizenship, having been naturalised as an American citizen in 2009. He primarily identifies as Irish. After taking up American citizenship, he was adamant he was not turning his back on his Irish roots. In 2009, nearly four decades after he was an undergraduate in physics and computer science at Queen's University, Belfast, the university awarded him an honorary doctorate which was presented to him in New York by Vice-Chancellor Professor Peter Gregson. In March 2011, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF. He is a patron of Belfast-based charity and film festival CineMagic, which helps young people get involved in the movie industry.\nA heavy smoker earlier in his career, Neeson quit smoking in 2003 while working on \"Love Actually\". When he took the role of Hannibal for the 2010 film adaptation of \"The A-Team\", he had reservations about smoking cigars (a signature trait of the character), but agreed to do it for the film.\nIn June 2012, Neeson's publicist denied reports that Neeson was converting to Islam. Neeson has expressed an affection for the \"adhan\", the Islamic call to prayer, to which he grew accustomed while filming \"Taken 2\" in Istanbul: \"By the third week, it was like I couldn't live without it. It really became hypnotic and very moving for me in a very special way. Very beautiful.\" He also expressed admiration for the \"Spiritual Exercises\" of Saint Ignatius of Loyola.\nNeeson's mother, Kitty, died in June 2020. He was unable to return to his hometown for her funeral due to travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSocial views.\nNeeson is a long-term supporter of the need for more integrated education in Northern Ireland; that is, educating Catholics and Protestants together. In 2017, he said, \"As Northern Ireland moves forward from division, who do we look to for a future we can share? Our children - so why do we continue to educate them apart? Different religions, different backgrounds, different schools. There is another way. Protestants and Catholics, other beliefs and none, learning and working together every day.\" He has praised schools where parents have voted to transform segregated schools into integrated schools, and fronted television advertisements to encourage more parents to integrate their children's schools.\nControversies.\nNeeson was criticised for his comments on Ireland's \"Late Late Show\" in January 2018, during which he described the MeToo movement as a \"witch hunt\" and cited Garrison Keillor's dismissal from Minnesota Public Radio as an example.\nIn February 2019, Neeson gained public and media controversy after a press junket interview he conducted with \"The Independent\" while promoting \"Cold Pursuit\", a film about a father seeking revenge for his son's murder. He said that he generated his character's \"primal\" anger by recounting an experience he had 40 years ago, in which a female friend of his had been raped by a stranger. After learning the attacker was a black man, Neeson said that he spent a week going \"up and down areas with a cosh, hoping some 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go\" so that he \"could kill him\". In the interview, he also said he was ashamed of the experience and that the things he did and said were \"horrible\". He said, \"It's awful [...] but I did learn a lesson from it, when I eventually thought, 'What the fuck are you doing?'\"\nIn an appearance on \"Good Morning America\", Neeson elaborated on his comments while denying being a racist, stating that he asked for physical attributes of the rapist other than his race and that he would have done the same if the rapist was \"a Scot or a Brit or a Lithuanian\". He also said that he had purposely gone into \"black areas of the city\" but that he \"did seek help\" and counselling from his friends and a priest after coming to his senses. He said that the lesson of his experience was \"to open up [and] to talk about these things\", including toxic masculinity and the underlying \"racism and bigotry\" in both the U.S. and Northern Ireland. The controversy following his comments led to cancellation of the red carpet event for the premiere of \"Cold Pursuit\". Neeson was publicly defended by Michelle Rodriguez, Whoopi Goldberg, John Barnes, Trevor Noah, and Ralph Fiennes. Donald Glover later convinced him to appear in his FX series \"Atlanta\" episode \"New Jazz\" as a fictionalised version of himself, to examine the controversy.\nActing credits and accolades.\nIn 2000, Neeson was offered the \"Freedom of the Town of Ballymena\" by the Ballymena Borough Council, but because of objections made by members of the Democratic Unionist Party regarding his comments that he had felt like a \"second-class citizen\" growing up as a Catholic in the town, he declined the award, citing tensions. Following the controversy, Neeson wrote a letter to the council, stating; \"I will always remain very proud of my upbringing in, and association with, the town and my country of birth, which I will continue to promote at every opportunity. Indeed, I regard the enduring support over the years from all sections of the community in Ballymena as being more than sufficient recognition for any success which I may have achieved as an actor.\" Subsequently, on 28 January 2013, Neeson received the Freedom of the Borough from Ballymena Borough Council at a ceremony in the town.\nNeeson was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II in her 2000 New Year Honours.

In 2009, at a ceremony in New York, Neeson was awarded an honorary doctorate by Queen's University, Belfast. On 9 April 2016, he was honoured with the Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award by the Irish Film and Television Academy (IFTA) at the Mansion House, Dublin, with Irish President Michael D. Higgins presenting the award. In 2017, Neeson was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 74 in the list of 200 Most Influential Philanthropists and Social Entrepreneurs Worldwide.

The Kingdom of Aragon was created sometime between 950 and 1035 when the County of Aragon, which had been acquired by the Kingdom of Navarre in the tenth century, was separated from Navarre in accordance with the will of King Sancho III (1004\u201335). In 1164, the marriage of the Aragonese princess Petronila (Kingdom of Aragon) and the Catalan count Ramon Berenguer IV (County of Barcelona) created a dynastic union from which what modern historians call \"the Crown of Aragon\" was born. In the thirteenth century the kingdoms of Valencia, Majorca and Sicily were added to the Crown, and in the fourteenth the Kingdom of Sardinia and Corsica. The Crown of Aragon continued to exist until 1713 when its separate constitutional systems (Catalan Constitutions, Aragon \"Fueros\", and Furs of Valencia) were abolished by the \"Nueva Planta\" decrees at the end of the War of the Spanish Succession.\nJim\u00e9nez dynasty, 1035\u20131164.\nWith the death of Sancho III of Pamplona, Aragon was inherited by his son Ramiro as an autonomous state.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHouse of Barcelona, 1164\u20131410.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHouse of Trast\u00e1mara, 1412\u20131555.\nNominally co-monarch of her son Charles I, Joanna I was confined for alleged insanity during her whole reign.\nClaimants against John II, 1462\u20131472.\nDuring the Catalan Civil War, there were three who claimed his throne, though this never included the Kingdom of Valencia.\nHouse of Habsburg, 1516\u20131700.\nAragon itself stayed loyal to Philip IV during the Reapers' War while Catalonia switched allegiance to Louis XIII and Louis XIV \"the Sun-King\" (see List of counts of Barcelona).

After this time, there are no more Aragonese monarchs.

For many games, the Computer Olympiads are an opportunity to claim the \"world's best computer player\" title. First contested in 1989, the majority of the games are board games but other games such as bridge take place as well. In 2010, several puzzles were included in the competition.\nHistory.\nDeveloped in the 1980s by David Levy, the first Computer Olympiad took place in 1989 at the Park Lane Hotel in London. The games ran on a yearly basis until after the 1992 games, when the Olympiad's ruling committee was unable to find a new organiser. This resulted in the games being suspended until 2000 when the Mind Sports Olympiad resurrected them. Recently, the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) has adopted the Computer Olympiad and tries to organise the event on an annual basis.\nGames contested.\nThe games which have been contested at each Olympiad are:\n6th\u201310th Olympiads (2000\u20132004).\nAfter an eight-year hiatus, the Computer Olympiad was revived by bringing it into the Mind Sports Olympiad. The chess competition was a special event, since it was adopted by the International Correspondence Chess Association (ICCA) as the 17th World Microcomputer Chess Championship (WMCC 2000). The 5th Olympiad was in 2000 at London's Alexandra Palace; the 6th, in 2001 at Ad Fundunm at Maastricht University; the 7th, in 2002 in Maastricht; the 8th, in 2003 in Graz; and the 9th, in 2004 in Ramat Gan. The 7th Olympiad was adopted by the ICCA as the 10th World Computer Chess Championship (WCCC), and the 8th was held in conjugation with both 11th WCCC and the 10th Advances in Computer Games Conference. Because of this, no medals were awarded for the two chess events. The 9th was held in conjugation with WCCC and the Computers and Games 2004 Conference; no medals were awarded to the two chess events. Jonathan Schaeffer and J. W. H. M. Uiterwijk were the tournament directors.\n10th\u201314th Olympiads (2005\u20132009).\nThe 10th Olympiad was in 2005 in Taipei; the 11th, in 2006 in Turin; the 12th, in 2007 at the Amsterdam Science Park; the 13th, in 2008 at the Beijing Golden Century Golf Club; and the 14th, in 2009 in Pamplona. The 10th Olympiad wasa held at the same time and location as the 11th Advances in Computer Games and its organizing committee was made up of J. W. Hellemons (chair), H. H. L. M. Donkers, M. Greenspan, T-s Hsu, H. J. van den Herik, and M. Tiessen. Hand Talk, which won the gold medal in Computer Go, was originally written in assembly language by a retired chemistry professor of Sun Yat-sen University, China. The 11th Olympiad was held in conjugation with the 14th World Computer Chess Championship and the 5th Computer and Games Conference. Human FIDE 37th Chess Olympiad co-hosted this event; the 12th, with the 15th World Computer Chess Championship and the Computer Games Workshop; the 13th, with the International Computer Games Championship, the World Computer Chess Championship, and a scientific conference on computer games; and the 14th with the World Computer Chess Championship and a scientific conference on computer games.\nRybka was retroactively disqualified from all ICCC events due to plagiarism.

The 16th Olympiad was held in 2011 at Tilburg University at the same time as the 19th WCCC. The 17th Olympiad was held in 2013 at Keio University's Collaboration Complex on the Hiyoshi Campus, and was at the same time as the 20th WCCC and a scientific conference on computer games. The 18th Olympiad was in 2015 at Leiden University and was organized by the International Computer Game Association, the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, and the Leiden Centre of Data Science.\n19th\u201325th Olympiads (2016\u20132022).\nThe 19th Olympiad was held 27 June \u2013 3 July 2016 and the 20th Olympiad was held 1\u20137 July 2017, both at Leiden University and organized by the International Computer Game Association, the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computer Science, and the Leiden Centre of Data Science. The 21st Olympiad was held 7\u201313 July 2018 in Taipei, Taiwan alongside the 10th International Conference on Computers and Games. The World Computer Chess Championships took place from 13\u201319 July in Stockholm, Sweden. The 22nd Olympiad was held 11\u201317 August 2019 in Macau, China and the 23rd (2020), 24th (2021), and 25th (2022) Olympiads were held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSummary by game.\nAbalone.\nAbalone is a strategy game using a hexagonal patterned board with 14 marbles for each of two players.

Dahl was a professor of computer science at the University of Oslo and is considered to be one of the fathers of Simula and object-oriented programming along with Kristen Nygaard.\nCareer.\nDahl was born in Mandal, Norway. He was the son of Finn Dahl (1898\u20131962) and Ingrid Othilie Kathinka Pedersen (1905\u201380). When he was seven, his family moved to Drammen. When he was thirteen, the whole family fled to Sweden during the German occupation of Norway in World War II. After the war's end, Dahl studied numerical mathematics at the University of Oslo.\nDahl became a full professor at the University of Oslo in 1968 and was a gifted teacher as well as researcher. Here he worked on \"Hierarchical Program Structures\", probably his most influential publication, which appeared co-authored with C.A.R. Hoare in the influential book \"Structured Programming\" of 1972 by Dahl, Edsger Dijkstra, and Hoare, perhaps the best-known academic book concerning software in the 1970s. As his career advanced, Dahl grew increasingly interested in the use of formal methods, to rigorously reason about object-orientation for example. His expertise ranged from the practical application of ideas to their formal mathematical underpinning to ensure the validity of the approach.\nDahl is widely accepted as Norway's foremost computer scientist. With Kristen Nygaard, he produced the initial ideas for object-oriented (OO) programming in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral (NR)) as part of the Simula I (1961\u20131965) and Simula 67 (1965\u20131968) simulation programming languages, which began as an extended variant and superset of ALGOL 60. Dahl and Nygaard were the first to develop the concepts of class, subclass (allowing implicit information hiding), inheritance, dynamic object creation, etc., all important aspects of the OO paradigm. An \"object\" is a self-contained component (with a data structure and associated procedures or \"methods\") in a software system. These are combined to form a complete system. The object-oriented approach is now pervasive in modern software development, including widely used imperative programming languages such as C++ and Java.\nHe received the Turing Award for his work in 2001 (with Kristen Nygaard). He received the 2002 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) John von Neumann Medal (with Kristen Nygaard) and was named Commander of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 2000.\nThe Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets named the Dahl-Nygaard Prize after Dahl.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bloodletting, whether by a physician or by leeches, was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluids were regarded as \"humors\" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It was the most common medical practice performed by surgeons from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of over 2,000 years. In Europe, the practice continued to be relatively common until the end of the 19th century. The practice has been abandoned by modern-style medicine for all except a few very specific medical conditions. In the beginning of the 19th century, studies had begun to show the harmful effects of bloodletting.\nThe modern term \"phlebotomy\" refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion. \"Therapeutic phlebotomy\" refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc., to reduce the number of red blood cells. The traditional medical practice of bloodletting is considered a pseudoscience, though the method is still commonly used in forms of alternative medicine.\nIn the ancient world.\nPassages from the Ebers Papyrus may indicate that bloodletting by scarification was an accepted practice in Ancient Egypt.\nEgyptian burials have been reported to contain bloodletting instruments.\nAccording to some accounts, the Egyptians based the idea on their observations of the hippopotamus, confusing its red secretions with blood and believing that it scratched itself to relieve distress.\nIn Greece, bloodletting was in use in the 5th century BC during the lifetime of Hippocrates, who mentions this practice but generally relied on dietary techniques. Erasistratus, however, theorized that many diseases were caused by plethoras, or overabundances, in the blood and advised that these plethoras be treated, initially, by exercise, sweating, reduced food intake, and vomiting. But his student Herophilus supported bloodletting. A contemporary Greek physician, Archagathus, one of the first to practice in Rome, also believed in the value of bloodletting.\n\"Bleeding\" a patient to health was modeled on the process of menstruation. Hippocrates believed that menstruation functioned to \"purge women of bad humours\". During the Roman Empire, the Greek physician Galen, who subscribed to the teachings of Hippocrates, advocated physician-initiated bloodletting.\nThe popularity of bloodletting in the classical Mediterranean world was reinforced by the ideas of Galen, after he discovered that not only veins but also arteries were filled with blood, not air as was commonly believed at the time. There were two key concepts in his system of bloodletting. The first was that blood was created and then used up; it did not circulate, and so it could \"stagnate\" in the extremities. The second was that humoral balance was the basis of illness or health, the four humours being blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile, relating to the four Greek classical elements of air, water, earth, and fire respectively. Galen believed that blood was the dominant humour and the one in most need of control. In order to balance the humours, a physician would either remove \"excess\" blood (plethora) from the patient or give them an emetic to induce vomiting, or a diuretic to induce urination.\nGalen created a complex system of how much blood should be removed based on the patient's age, constitution, the season, the weather and the place. \"Do-it-yourself\" bleeding instructions following these systems were developed. Symptoms of plethora were believed to include fever, apoplexy, and headache. The blood to be let was of a specific nature determined by the disease: either arterial or venous, and distant or close to the area of the body affected. He linked different blood vessels with different organs, according to their supposed drainage. For example, the vein in the right hand would be let for liver problems and the vein in the left hand for problems with the spleen. The more severe the disease, the more blood would be let. Fevers required copious amounts of bloodletting.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe Talmud recommended a specific day of the week and days of the month for bloodletting in the Shabbat tractate. During medieval times bleeding charts were common, showing specific bleeding sites on the body in alignment with the planets and zodiacs. Islamic medical authors also advised bloodletting, particularly for fevers. It was practised according to seasons and certain phases of the Moon in the lunar calendar. The practice was probably passed by the Greeks with the translation of ancient texts to Arabic and is different than bloodletting by cupping mentioned in the traditions of Muhammad. When Muslim theories became known in the Latin-speaking countries of Europe, bloodletting became more widespread. Together with cautery, it was central to Arabic surgery; the key texts \"Kitab al-Qanun\" and especially \"\" both recommended it. It was also known in Ayurvedic medicine, described in the \"Susruta Samhita\".\nUse in the 1600s through the 19th century.\nBloodletting became a main technique of heroic medicine, a traumatic and destructive collection of medical practices that emerged in the 18th century.\nEven after the humoral system fell into disuse, the practice was continued by surgeons and barber-surgeons. Though the bloodletting was often \"recommended\" by physicians, it was carried out by barbers. This led to the distinction between physicians and surgeons. The red-and-white-striped pole of the barbershop, still in use today, is derived from this practice: the red symbolizes blood while the white symbolizes the bandages. Bloodletting was used to \"treat\" a wide range of diseases, becoming a standard treatment for almost every ailment, and was practiced prophylactically as well as therapeutically.\nA number of different methods were employed. The most common was \"phlebotomy\", or \"venesection\" (often called \"breathing a vein\"), in which blood was drawn from one or more of the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In \"arteriotomy\", an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In \"scarification\" (not to be confused with scarification, a method of body modification), the \"superficial\" vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded lancet, or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a vacuum within (see fire cupping). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a \"scarificator\", used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel. One knife bar gear has slipped teeth, turning the blades in a different direction than those on the other bars. The last photo and the diagram show the depth adjustment bar at the back and sides.\nLeeches could also be used. The withdrawal of so much blood as to induce syncope (fainting) was considered beneficial, and many sessions would only end when the patient began to swoon.\nWilliam Harvey disproved the basis of the practice in 1628, and the introduction of scientific medicine, \"la m\u00e9thode num\u00e9rique\", allowed Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis to demonstrate that phlebotomy was entirely ineffective in the treatment of pneumonia and various fevers in the 1830s. Nevertheless, in 1838, a lecturer at the Royal College of Physicians would still state that \"blood-letting is a remedy which, when judiciously employed, it is hardly possible to estimate too highly\", and Louis was dogged by the sanguinary Broussais, who could recommend leeches fifty at a time. Some physicians resisted Louis' work because they \"were not prepared to discard therapies 'validated by both tradition and their own experience on account of somebody else's numbers'.\"\nDuring this era, bloodletting was used to treat almost every disease. One British medical text recommended bloodletting for acne, asthma, cancer, cholera, coma, convulsions, diabetes, epilepsy, gangrene, gout, herpes, indigestion, insanity, jaundice, leprosy, ophthalmia, plague, pneumonia, scurvy, smallpox, stroke, tetanus, tuberculosis, and for some one hundred other diseases. Bloodletting was even used to treat most forms of hemorrhaging such as nosebleed, excessive menstruation, or hemorrhoidal bleeding. Before surgery or at the onset of childbirth, blood was removed to prevent inflammation. Before amputation, it was customary to remove a quantity of blood equal to the amount believed to circulate in the limb that was to be removed.\nThere were also theories that bloodletting would cure \"heartsickness\" and \"heartbreak\". A French physician, Jacques Ferrand wrote a book in 1623 on the uses of bloodletting to cure a broken heart. He recommended bloodletting to the point of heart failure (literal).\nLeeches became especially popular in the early 19th century. In the 1830s, the French imported about 40 million leeches a year for medical purposes, and in the next decade, England imported 6 million leeches a year from France alone. Through the early decades of the century, hundreds of millions of leeches were used by physicians throughout Europe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One typical course of medical treatment began the morning of 13 July 1824. A French sergeant was stabbed through the chest while engaged in single combat; within minutes, he fainted from loss of blood. Arriving at the local hospital he was immediately bled twenty ounces (570\u00a0ml) \"to prevent inflammation\". During the night he was bled another 24\u00a0ounces (680\u00a0ml). Early the next morning, the chief surgeon bled the patient another 10\u00a0ounces (285\u00a0ml); during the next 14\u00a0hours, he was bled five more times. Medical attendants thus intentionally removed more than half of the patient's normal blood supply\u2014in addition to the initial blood loss which caused the sergeant to faint. Bleedings continued over the next several days. By 29 July, the wound had become inflamed. The physician applied 32 leeches to the most sensitive part of the wound. Over the next three days, there were more bleedings and a total of 40 more leeches. The sergeant recovered and was discharged on 3 October. His physician wrote that \"by the large quantity of blood lost, amounting to 170\u00a0ounces [nearly eleven pints] (4.8\u00a0liters), besides that drawn by the application of leeches [perhaps another two pints] (1.1\u00a0liters), the life of the patient was preserved\". By nineteenth-century standards, thirteen pints of blood taken over the space of a month was a large but not an exceptional quantity. The medical literature of the period contains many similar accounts\u2014some successful, some not.\nBloodletting was also popular in the young United States of America, where Benjamin Rush (a signatory of the Declaration of Independence) saw the state of the arteries as the key to disease, recommending levels of bloodletting that were high even for the time. George Washington asked to be bled heavily after he developed a throat infection from weather exposure. Within a ten-hour period, a total of 124\u2013126 ounces (3.75\u00a0liters) of blood was withdrawn prior to his death from a throat infection in 1799.\nOne reason for the continued popularity of bloodletting (and purging) was that, while anatomical knowledge, surgical and diagnostic skills increased tremendously in Europe from the 17th century, the key to curing disease remained elusive, and the underlying belief was that it was better to give any treatment than nothing at all. The psychological benefit of bloodletting to the patient (a placebo effect) may sometimes have outweighed the physiological problems it caused. Bloodletting slowly lost favour during the 19th century, after French physician Dr. Pierre Louis conducted an experiment in which he studied the effect of bloodletting on pneumonia patients. A number of other ineffective or harmful treatments were available as placebos\u2014mesmerism, various processes involving the new technology of electricity, many potions, tonics, and elixirs. Yet, bloodletting persisted during the 19th century partly because it was readily available to people of any socioeconomic status.\nBarbara Ehrenreich and Deirdre English write that the popularity of bloodletting and heroic medicine in general was because of a need to justify medical billing. Traditional healing techniques had been mostly practiced by women within a non-commercial family or village setting. As male doctors suppressed these techniques, they found it difficult to quantify various \"amounts\" of healing to charge for, and difficult to convince patients to pay for it. Because bloodletting seemed active and dramatic, it helped convince patients the doctor had something tangible to sell.\nControversy and use into the 20th century.\nBloodletting gradually declined in popularity over the course of the 19th century, becoming rather uncommon in most places, before its validity was thoroughly debated. In the medical community of Edinburgh, bloodletting was abandoned in practice before it was challenged in theory, a contradiction highlighted by physician-physiologist John Hughes Bennett. Authorities such as Austin Flint I, Hiram Corson, and William Osler became prominent supporters of bloodletting in the 1880s and onwards, disputing Bennett's premise that bloodletting had fallen into disuse because it did not work. These advocates framed bloodletting as an orthodox medical practice, to be used in spite of its general unpopularity. Some physicians considered bloodletting useful for a more limited range of purposes, such as to \"clear out\" infected or weakened blood or its ability to \"cause h\u00e6morrhages to cease\"\u2014as evidenced in a call for a \"fair trial for blood-letting as a remedy\" in 1871.\nSome researchers used statistical methods for evaluating treatment effectiveness to discourage bloodletting. But at the same time, publications by Philip Pye-Smith and others defended bloodletting on scientific grounds.\nBloodletting persisted into the 20th century and was recommended in the 1923 edition of the textbook \"The Principles and Practice of Medicine\". The textbook was originally written by Sir William Osler and continued to be published in new editions under new authors following Osler's death in 1919.\nBloodletting was once thought to reduce inflammation, boost immunity, and improve circulation by aiding in the detoxification of the blood circulating throughout the body. Over time, however, bloodletting's harmful impacts made the practice a less preferable form of medicine. Not only was bloodletting generally ineffective, it also commonly led to significant blood loss. High loss of blood made patients highly susceptible to infection/sepsis or the formation of a hematoma. Additionally, bloodletting also caused anemia, leading the patient to feel weak, tired, or even go unconscious. The harmful effects did not stop there; in severe cases, bloodletting had the potential to cause deadly hypovolemic shock. As the medical world advanced, these deadly effects made the practice of bloodletting fade in popularity.\nTherapeutic phlebotomy.\nTherapeutic phlebotomy is used today in the treatment of a few diseases, including hemochromatosis, sickle cell disease, porphyria cutanea tarda, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and polycythemia. It is practiced by specifically trained practitioners in hospitals using modern techniques and a relatively safe procedure that depletes iron stores in the body. In most cases, phlebotomy now refers to the removal of \"small\" quantities of blood for diagnostic purposes and is an important procedure in the U.S.. According to an academic article posted in the \"Journal of Infusion Nursing\" with data published in 2010, the primary use of phlebotomy is to take blood that would be reinfused back into a person (blood donation). However, in the case of hemochromatosis, bloodletting (by venipuncture) has become the mainstay treatment option. Therapeutic phlebotomy is a cost effective way to remove excess iron in blood for patients that have hemochromatosis. \nCross-cultural bloodletting.\nTherapeutic uses of bloodletting were reported in 60 distinct cultures/ethnic groups in the HRAF database, present in all inhabited continents. Bloodletting has also been reported in 15 of the 60 cultures in the https:// list. The PSF is a subset of eHRAF data that includes only one culture from each of 60 macro-culture areas around the world. The prevalence of bloodletting in PSF controls for pseudo-replication linked to common ancestry, suggesting that bloodletting has independently emerged many times. Bloodletting is varied in its practices cross-culturally, for example, in native Alaskan culture bloodletting was practiced for different indications, using different tools, on different body areas, by different people, and it was explained by different medical theories.\nAccording to Helena Miton et al.'s analysis of the HRAF database and other sources, there are several cross-cultural patterns in bloodletting.\nIn a transmission chain experiment done on people living in the US through Amazon Mechanical Turk, stories about bloodletting in a non-affected area were much more likely to transition into stories about bloodletting being administered near the area in pain than vice versa. This suggests that colocalized bloodletting could be a cultural attractor and is more likely to be culturally transmitted, even among people in the US who are likely more familiar with non-colocalized bloodletting. \nBloodletting as a concept is thought to be a cultural attractor, or an intrinsically attractive / culturally transmissible concept. This could explain bloodletting's independent cross-cultural emergence and common cross-cultural traits.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It follows a crew of scientists on a space station research facility as they attempt to understand an extraterrestrial intelligence, which takes the form of a vast ocean on the titular alien planet. The novel is one of Lem's best-known works.\nThe book has been adapted many times for film, radio, and theater. Prominent film adaptations include Andrei Tarkovsky's 1972 version and Steven Soderbergh's 2002 version, although Lem later remarked that none of these films reflected the book's thematic emphasis on the limitations of human rationality.\nPlot summary.\n\"Solaris\" chronicles the ultimate futility of attempted communications with the extraterrestrial life inhabiting a distant alien planet named Solaris. The planet is almost completely covered with an ocean of gelatinous material that turns out to be a single, planet-encompassing entity. Terran scientists conjecture it is a living and sentient being, and attempt to communicate with it.\nKris Kelvin, a psychologist, arrives aboard Solaris Station, a scientific research station hovering near the oceanic surface of Solaris. The scientists there have studied the planet and its ocean for many decades, mostly in vain. A scientific discipline known as Solaristics has degenerated over the years to simply observing, recording and categorizing the complex phenomena that occur on the surface of the ocean. Thus far, the scientists have only compiled an elaborate nomenclature of the phenomena, and do not yet understand what they really mean. Shortly before Kelvin's arrival, the crew exposed the ocean to a more aggressive and unauthorized experimentation with a high-energy X-ray bombardment. Their experimentation gives unexpected results and becomes psychologically traumatic for them as individually flawed humans.\nThe ocean's response to this intrusion exposes the deeper, hidden aspects of the personalities of the human scientists, while revealing nothing of the ocean's nature itself. It does this by materializing physical simulacra (including human ones) based on the unpleasant repressed memories of the researchers, who visit the corresponding researchers. Kelvin confronts memories of his dead lover and guilt about her suicide, which constitutes a significant part of the plot. The \"visitors\" of the other persons are only alluded to. \nAll efforts to make sense of Solaris's activities prove futile. As Lem wrote, \"the peculiarity of those phenomena seems to suggest that we observe a kind of rational activity, but the meaning of this seemingly rational activity of the Solarian Ocean is beyond the reach of human beings.\" Lem also wrote that he deliberately chose to make the sentient alien an ocean to avoid any personification and the pitfalls of anthropomorphism in depicting first contact.\nCriticism and interpretations.\nThe novel is the best known elaboration of Lem's trope of the impossibility of communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, present in many of Lem's novels, including his first, \"The Man from Mars\", and his last, \"Fiasco\".\nIn an interview, Lem said that the novel \"has always been a juicy prey for critics\", with interpretations ranging from that of Freudianism, critique of contact and colonialism, to anticommunism, proponents of the latter view holding that the Ocean represents the Soviet Union and the people on the space station represent the satellite countries of Central and Eastern Europe. He also commented on the absurdity of the book cover blurb for the 1976 edition, which said the novel \"expressed the humanistic beliefs of the author about high moral qualities of the human\". Lem noted that the critic who promulgated the Freudian idea actually blundered by basing his psychoanalysis on dialogue from the English translation, whereas his diagnosis would fail on the idioms in the original Polish text.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are humanitarian and chivalrous; we don't want to enslave other races, we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over their heritage in exchange.\u00a0We think of ourselves as the Knights of the Holy Contact.

We need mirrors.\u2014\u200a\nEnglish translations.\nBoth the original Polish version of the novel (published in 1961) and its English translation are titled \"Solaris\". Jean-Michel Jasiensko published his French translation in 1964 and that version was the basis of Joanna Kilmartin and Steve Cox's English translation (Walker and Company, 1970; Faber and Faber, 1971). Lem, who read English fluently, repeatedly voiced his disappointment with the Kilmartin\u2013Cox version.\nIn 2011, Bill Johnston completed an English translation from the Polish. Lem's wife and son reviewed this version more favorably: \"We are very content with Professor Johnston's work, that seems to have captured the spirit of the original.\" It was released as an audio book and later in an Amazon Kindle edition (2014, ). Due to legal issues, this translation did not appear in print until 2024, when Conversation Tree Press published a fine press edition of the book.\nAdaptations.\nCinema.\n\"Solaris\" has been filmed three times:\nLem himself observed that none of the film versions depict much of the extraordinary physical and psychological \"alienness\" of the Solaris ocean.

From 1877, after the establishment of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, Norwegian banknotes of 1000, 500, 200, 100, 50, 10 and 5 kroner have been put into circulation. The first 200 kroner banknote was first published in 1994. The others have been in use since 1877. Banknotes of 5 and 10 kroner were in use until 1963 and 1983 when they were replaced by coins.\nFrom 1917 to 1925 and 1940-1950 there was a shortage of small change, and 1 and 2 kroner banknotes were printed as \"arbitration coins banknotes.\" The first edition was canceled in 1926, while the second edition was formally valid right up to 1999.\nHistory.\nFrom 1877, after the establishment of the Scandinavian Monetary Union, and until the present day, Norwegian banknotes have included 1000, 500, 100, and 50 kroner notes. In 1994 the first 200 kroner note was issued. 5 and 10 kroner notes were also used from 1877, but these were replaced by coins in 1963 and 1983 respectively.\nDuring World War I and World War II and their aftermaths of 1917\u20131925 and 1940\u20131950, there was a shortage of change, so 1\u00a0 krone and 2\u00a0 kroner notes were printed as \"coin notes\". The World War I edition was rendered invalid in 1926, whereas the World War II edition technically remained legal tender until 1999.\nCurrent banknotes.\nThe current design of Series VIII was introduced on 30 May 2017, with plans to be fully implemented by the fourth quarter of 2019. The designs are by The Metric System and Sn\u00f8hetta and use an abstract geometric design influenced by the Beaufort scale.\nSeries VIII (2017 \u2013 present).\nSeries VIII banknotes are printed by Oberthur Fiduciaire in France. Banknote order quantities \nHistorical banknotes.\nAll Norwegian notes issued since 1877 are listed below in reverse chronological order. The notes have been issued in series starting with series I in 1877 and going on series VII from 1994. As of 2012 only series VII is in circulation, while series VI is convertible at the central bank until 1 November 2012.\nThe world wars created a great need for cash. In 1917 a law was passed to allow for 1\u00a0 krone and 2\u00a0 kroner \"coin notes\" in response to a pledge from the Bank of Norway to the Ministry of Finance:\n\" The board of directors at the Bank of Norway has in writing on the 8th September 1917 informed the Ministry that the shortage of change has now become outright intolerable. One company after another complain that they cannot arrange the agreed salaries for their workers, and the merchants cannot change their customers' banknotes.\"\nSubsequently, coin notes were printed until 1925 but were invalidated already in 1926 when the economy had stabilized after World War I. Coin notes of 1\u00a0 krone and 2\u00a0 kroner were also printed during World War II (1940\u221245) and up until 1950. These were not invalidated after the war. However, the complete series II printed 1901\u221245 was rendered invalid on 9 September 1945 and those who could not readily justify their amount of cash were only given limited compensation in new money. This was done to diminish the impact of war profiteering.\n5\u00a0kroner and 10\u00a0kroner notes were used from 1877 but were replaced by coins in 1963 and 1983, respectively, based on cost-benefit analyses. Apart from the World War I coin notes in 1926 and the series II notes in 1945, all Norwegian banknotes from series I through series V, including 5\u00a0kroner and 10\u00a0kroner notes, plus the World War II coin notes, were technically valid \u2013 i.e. convertible at the Bank of Norway \u2013 all the way until 1998 (series I) and 1999 (series III, IV, V, and the World War II coin notes). The 1000\u00a0kroner and 500\u00a0kroner notes of series V were valid until 2001 and 2002 respectively.\nSeries VII (1994-2020).\nThe 50\u00a0kroner note (1997) portrays Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen (1812\u20131885), writer and collector of Norwegian folktales. Since 1999 the serial number has been printed with ultraviolet fluorescence. The previous edition (1984), no longer valid, portrays Aasmund Olavsson Vinje (1818\u20131879), poet, author, and proponent of Nynorsk. This was the first Norwegian banknote featuring the Nynorsk name of Norway, \"Noreg\" (compare with Bokm\u00e5l: \"Norge\").\nThe wear and tear on the 50\u00a0kroner notes has become so harsh in recent years, possibly from people not regarding them as very valuable any more, so that their maintenance cost is becoming a problem for the Bank of Norway. The 50\u00a0kroner note may well be replaced by a 50\u00a0kroner coin in the not too distant future.\nThe 100\u00a0kroner note (1997) portrays Kirsten Flagstad (1895\u20131962), opera singer and first director of the Norwegian National Opera. In 2003 this note was upgraded with a holographic metal foil stripe. The previous edition (1979), no longer valid, was the first Norwegian banknote featuring a woman: Camilla Collett (1813\u20131895), author, feminist activist, sister of Henrik Wergeland (author and poet), and daughter of Nicolai Wergeland (priest and co-founder of the Norwegian constitution). Camilla actually replaced her brother on the 100 kroner note, where he had been the motif since 1949.\nAfter considerable inflation during the 1970s and 1980s, there was need for a denomination between 100\u00a0kroner and 1000\u00a0kroner in addition to 500\u00a0kroner, and so the first Norwegian 200\u00a0kroner note was issued in 1994. It portrays Kristian Birkeland (1867\u20131917), magnetism researcher, inventor, and co-founder of Norsk Hydro. In 2002 this note was upgraded with a holographic metal foil stripe.\nThe front of the 200\u00a0kroner note shows a portrait of Kristian Birkeland against a stylized pattern of the aurora borealis and a very large snowflake. Birkeland's terrella experiment, which consisted of a small, magnetized sphere representing the Earth suspended in an evacuated box, is shown on the left. When subjected to an electron beam a glow of light would appear around the magnetic poles of the terrella, simulating the aurora.\nThe back of the 200\u00a0kroner note shows a map of the north polar regions including Scandinavia to the right and northern Canada to the left. A ring encircling the magnetic dip pole (located near Resolute, Canada) symbolizes the location of auroral phenomena including the satellite-determined statistical location of Birkeland currents. Birkeland's original depiction of field-aligned currents published in 1908 is shown in the lower right corner.\nThe 500\u00a0kroner note (1999) portrays Sigrid Undset (1882\u20131949), author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1927. The note features a holographic metal foil stripe and other security measures. The previous edition (1991), no longer valid, portrays Edvard Grieg (1843\u20131907), world-renowned national romantic composer and pianist.\nThe use of the 500\u00a0kroner note has increased in recent years, especially after it was introduced to automatic teller machines along with the 200\u00a0kroner note. Conversely, the 100\u00a0kroner note has been partly displaced from ATMs, and its use has decreased.\nThe 1000\u00a0kroner note (2001) portrays Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944), expressionist painter and graphic artist. The note features a holographic metal foil stripe and other security measures. The previous edition (1990), no longer valid, portrays Christian Magnus Falsen (1782\u20131830), a co-founder of the Norwegian constitution.\nThe most valuable Norwegian banknote has always been the 1000\u00a0kroner note, but its value has been decimated during the years. In 100 years from 1904 to 2004 the value of 1000\u00a0kroner has decreased 55\u2212fold, from more than 4000\u00a0loaves of bread to less than 70\u00a0loaves. (The price of a bread in 2004 was approximately 15\u00a0kroner, and the consumer price index in said period increased from 2.0 to 113.3.)\nSeries I (1877\u20131901).\nSource: http://\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "64202", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64202", "title": "2002 Commonwealth Games", "text": "Multi-sport event in Manchester, England\nThe 2002 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XVII Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Manchester 2002, were an international multi-sport event for the members of the Commonwealth held in Manchester, England, from 25 July to 4 August 2002. According to planning, this event was to be held in a country in the United Kingdom as part of the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II, head of the Commonwealth. England was the only bidder for the event and, in an internal process, Manchester was selected for the 2002 Games ahead of London. The Manchester bid used projects which were part of the failed bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, which were awarded to Sydney, Australia. The 2002 Commonwealth Games was, prior to the 2012 Summer Olympics, the largest multi-sport event ever to be held in the UK, eclipsing the London 1948 Summer Olympics in terms of teams and athletes participating. The 2002 Commonwealth Games had the largest number of events of any Commonwealth Games in history, featuring 281 events across 17 sports.\nThe event was considered a success for the host city, providing an opportunity to display how Manchester reeinvented itself as city, following the 1996 IRA bombing. The Games formed the main catalyst for the widespread regeneration and heavy development of Manchester and bolstered its reputation as a European and global city internationally. Rapid economic development and continued urban regeneration of the now post-industrial Manchester continued after the Games, which helped cement its place as one of the principal cultural cities in the United Kingdom.\nThe opening and closing ceremonies, the athletics, and the rugby sevens events were held at the City of Manchester Stadium, which was purpose-built for the Games. Unusually for a Commonwealth Games, the only sport that was held outside the host city was shooting, which was held in the National Shooting Centre in Bisley, Surrey, some from Manchester. Seventy-two associations competed in 14 individual sports and 3 team sports events.\nSporting legacy includes the British Cycling team, which inherited the Manchester Velodrome and went on to win eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympics and another eight gold medals at the 2012 Olympics, partly attributed to the availability of the velodrome. The stadium was leased long-term to Manchester City F.C., and, as a result, they have since found themselves in a desirable investment opportunity in the age of foreign football investment. The club was taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group led by Sheikh Mansour in 2008, a takeover that would have been far less certain without the stadium. The Games were a formative moment for Manchester and Britain, with then-IOC president Jacques Rogge viewing the games as an important litmus test as to whether Britain could host the Summer Olympics. The success of the Games quickly encouraged some speculation of a city bid for the Olympics, but London bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, with London going on to win the bid on 6 July 2005 and the games were successfully staged seven years later.\nHost city selection.\nWhen England decided to bid for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, three English cities \u2013 London, Manchester and Sheffield -showed interest in hosting the Games. The Commonwealth Games Council of England (CGCE) had to choose one city to put forward to the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF). London had hosted the 1934 Commonwealth Games as well as the 1908 and 1948 Summer Olympics, while Sheffield had hosted the 1991 Summer Universiade. Manchester had unsuccessfully bid for the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics, and Bob Scott, chairman of the Olympic bid committees, led the bid for another big event.\nSheffield withdrew from the bidding process when the city was unable to come to agreement over financial guarantees. This left the 24 members of the CGCE to choose between Manchester and London, with Manchester winning 17\u20137. Cities from no other countries submitted bids and so Manchester was announced as the host city of the 2002 Games on 6 November 1995.\nPreparation and development.\nVenues.\nThe Games' main venue was the City of Manchester Stadium (now Etihad Stadium), which hosted all athletics events, the rugby sevens and the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium was a smaller and downscaled version of that proposed during Manchester's bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics. Construction started in January 2000, and was completed shortly before the Games. The cost was approximately \u00a3110 million, \u00a377 million of which was provided by Sport England, with the remainder funded by Manchester City Council. For the Commonwealth Games the stadium featured a single lower tier running around three sides of the athletics track, and second tiers to the two sides, with an open-air temporary stand at one end, giving an overall capacity of 41,000. The stadium formed the centrepiece of an area known as Sportcity. Other venues in Sportcity include the Manchester Velodrome, which hosted cycling, and the \u00a33.5 million National Squash Centre, which was built specifically for the Games.\nSwimming and diving events took place at Manchester Aquatics Centre, another purpose-built venue, and until 2012,was the only one in the United Kingdom with two 50 metre pools.\nThe Manchester Arena built in 1994, at the time was the largest arena in Europe hosted netball finals and boxing preliminares.\nThe shooting events were held at the National Shooting Centre (NSC), Bisley (located in Surrey). The NSC saw major redevelopment of all its ranges in order to host the fullbore rifle, smallbore rifle, pistol and clay target events.\nAthletes' village.\nThe athletes' village of the event was located in the residential area of the University of Manchester Fallowfield Campus -in an area of 30 acres, being built specifically for the event and after the event, the buildings were donated to the university and turned an expansion of the housing complex.\nQueen's jubilee baton relay.\nThe 2002 Queen's Jubilee Baton Relay, the continuation of a tradition that started with the 1958 Games, consisted of the relay of an electronic baton, containing a personal message from Elizabeth II across 23 Commonwealth nations. The relay culminated in the arrival of the baton at the City of Manchester Stadium, opening the Games. The speech was then removed electronically from the baton, and read by Her Majesty to open the Games.\nThe 2002 Baton itself was designed by a company called IDEO, and was constructed of machined aluminium with the handle plated for conductivity. It weighed 1.69\u00a0kg, reached over 710\u00a0mm, and was 42.5\u00a0mm to 85\u00a0mm in diameter. The Queen's message itself was held in an aluminium capsule inserted into the top of the Baton. On either side of the Baton were two sterling silver coins, designed by Mappin and Webb, which celebrated the City of Manchester as host of the XVII Commonwealth Games.\nThe Baton was also equipped with sensors that detected and monitored the Runner's pulse rate. This information was then conveyed to a series of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), via a light behaviour module. The lens then transformed the LEDs into a shaft of bright blue pulsating light which synchronised with each new Runner. The hearts of the Runner and the Baton then beat as one until it was passed on, symbolising the journey of humanity and the essence of life.\nThe Queen's Jubilee Baton Relay passed through over 500 cities, towns and villages across the UK and the Baton was carried by 5,000 individuals, with each Runner carrying the Baton up to 500 yards, however on Saturday 15 June, the baton was snatched from a runners hand in the town of Connah's Quay, Deeside in north Wales.\nThe UK Baton Runners were made up of people from all walks of life including athletes, celebrities and local heroes from all over the country. Around 2500 Jubilee Runners were nominated by the community to carry the Baton, because they made a special contribution to their community or achieved a personal goal against the odds.\nThe judging of the Jubilee Runners was conducted by a panel of judges under the supervision of The Duke of Edinburgh's Award in January 2002. The relay was sponsored by Cadbury Schweppes, a major UK confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer.\nBudget.\nThe cost of hosting the 2002 Commonwealth Games was estimated at \u00a3300 million. Prior to the games, a \u00a3100 million was required to fill a financial black hole and the government agreed to provide the funding required, despite some believing that \u00a3300 million was too much.\nCultureshock and Festival Live.\nCultureshock was the Commonwealth Games Cultural Programme which ran alongside the Games themselves. The events ranged from images of the athlete as hero in sculpture and photography (Go! Freeze, which ran at Turton Tower in Bolton) to a Zulu performance at The Lowry. There was an exhibition at the Whitworth Art Gallery called Tales of Power: West African Textiles, and a performance of the film Monsoon Wedding at Clwyd Theatr Cymru. The geographical range was from Cheshire in the south to Blackburn and Cumbria in the north, and included that year the various Melas that take place around the region.\nCultureshock also ensured that a wide range of cultural events and acts reached the \"man on the street\", with the city centre of Manchester filled with bands, performers, and artists of various forms entertaining the thousands of visitors to the Games. It also coincided with the BBC's 2002 Festival Live series of open-air concerts and celebrations around the country, held to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee. Many of the cultural events were covered by the BBC 2002 radio station covering the games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe Project &amp; Artistic Director for the Opening Ceremony was David Zolkwer. Five-time Olympic champion Sir Steve Redgrave opened the two-and-a-quarter-hour opening ceremony by banging a large drum, which initiated a co-ordinated dance and fireworks act. The champion rower was joined on the stage by sporting stars including yachtswoman Ellen MacArthur, heptathlete Denise Lewis, long-distance runner Moses Kiptanui, swimmer Susie O'Neill and sprinter Donovan Bailey. The Grenadier Guards shared the arena with pop band S Club and Salford-born opera singer Russell Watson sang the Games' theme, \"Faith of the Heart\", while the arrival of HM The Queen was greeted with a flypast by the Red Arrows. England football captain David Beckham helped chaperone Queen's Baton final runner Kirsty Howard, assisting the terminally ill six-year-old to hand the baton to The Queen. A 4,000-strong cast took part in the \u00a312 million spectacular, which in theme and tone consisted of a mix of \"pomp and pop\", combining the ceremonial aspects of the Games with a party-style atmosphere, based on Manchester's reputation as the party city of \"Madchester\". The ceremony was voiced by broadcaster Anthony Davis.\nThe traditional athletes' parade was led by previous hosts Malaysia, and England brought up the rear before The Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth, declared the Games open:\n\"All of us participating in this ceremony tonight, whether athletes or spectators, or those watching on television around the world, can share in the ideals of this unique association of nations,\"\n\"We can all draw inspiration from what the Commonwealth stands for, our diversity as a source of strength, our tradition of tolerance\u00a0... our focus on young people, for they are our future.\"\n\"It is my pleasure in this my Golden Jubilee Year to declare the 17th Commonwealth Games open.\"\nClosing ceremony.\nThe Project &amp; Artistic Director for the Closing Ceremony was David Zolkwer. The Queen ended 11 days of competition at a rain-drenched closing ceremony in the City of Manchester Stadium. She declared the Games closed in front of a sell-out crowd gathered in the stadium. She also called on the athletes to assemble again in four years in Melbourne and to continue displaying the \"friendship\" they had shown in Manchester. The ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Tony Blair and several other dignitaries, took place in pouring rain and like the opening ceremony, mixed \"pomp with pop\". Australian Ian Thorpe, the star of the Games with his six swimming golds, carried his national flag into the arena, along with athletes from each of the other competing countries. Around balloons were released into the rainy Manchester sky as the ceremony concluded with a spectacular fireworks display.\nClosing ceremony highlights included:\nParticipating teams.\nThere were 73 participating countries, territories and Commonwealth regions at the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The 2002 event marked the last time Zimbabwe has participated to date; Zimbabwe formally withdrew from the Commonwealth of Nations the following year.\nSports.\nThere were the maximum of 17 sports included in the schedule for the 2002 Commonwealth Games.\nAfter experimenting with it on a smaller scale at the 1994 Commonwealth Games and dropping it at the 1998 Games, disabled competitions were held in swimming, athletics, bowls, table tennis and weightlifting (powerlifting). The medals were added to the final tally for each nation.\nLegacy host city and nation.\nIn terms of infrastructure, the Games were the catalyst for the widespread redevelopment of the east of the city, an area which had remained derelict since the departure of heavy industry some decades before. The 2002 Commonwealth Games set a new benchmark for hosting the Commonwealth Games and for cities wishing to bid for them with a heavy emphasis on legacy.\nThe venue and financial policy of the 2002 Commonwealth Games has influenced future sporting events, including the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, the 2012 Summer Olympics in London and 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.\nIn comparison to other sporting events, the 2002 games were marked by financial discipline. The cost of the 2010 Commonwealth Games were estimated at $4.1 billion, the London 2012 Summer Olympics are estimated to cost \u00a39 billion, while the 2014 Commonwealth Games could cost as much as \u00a3500 million.\nSporting legacy included the City of Manchester Stadium which was turned over to Manchester City Football Club, to replace the ageing Maine Road. It is possible that this provided an incentive which led to the eventual 2008 take over by the Abu Dhabi United group led by Sheikh Mansour. Consequently, they have seen a considerable upturn in their success, with a series of transfers which has increased the profile of Manchester further, as Manchester City have become title challengers. Indeed, journalists have stated Mansour would not had bought the city had the club not had the 50,000 stadium. The Manchester Velodrome was built in 1994 in preparation for an Olympic bid, but subsequently hosted the 2002 Commonwealth Games. Since opening in 1994, it has been cited as a catalyst for Britain's successes in track cycling since 2002. At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the Great British cycling claimed 8 of the 18 gold medals on offer, including 14 of the 54 medals available altogether. This unprecedented achievement was partly attributed the availability of a velodrome.\nLocal communities benefited from facilities built for the game such as the Manchester Aquatics Centre, the Northern Regional Tennis Centre and the National Squash Centre. There were comprehensive upgrades of Belle Vue and Moss Side leisure centres serve their local communities.\nOlympic president Jacques Rogge said the Games had gone a long way to restoring Britain's credibility in terms of hosting big sporting events. It has since been said that the success of the games was a major factor in reassuring the UK's sporting authorities and the government that the country could successfully stage major successful international sporting events and that, without them, London's successful bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics would not have come about. Public houses and restaurants in Manchester reported a threefold increase in takings during the Games, and local tourism board Marketing Manchester estimate some more visitors will come to the city each year as a result of its increased profile. It is estimated that by 2008 \u00a3600m has been invested in the region as a result of the Games and that about 20,000 jobs had been created.\nMarketing.\nLogo.\nThe 2002 Commonwealth Games' logo is an image of three figures standing on a podium with their arms uplifted in the jubilation of winning or in celebration, which represents the three core themes of the Games: sport, culture and friendship and the types of medalist in the games: gold, silver and bronze. The figures are captured in three colours which are red, blue and green. The red represents performance, passion and success; the blue symbolises intelligence, confidence and reliability, while the green represents loyalty, balance and generosity. The yellow background behind the figures represents the competitive, powerful and cheerful elements of the Games, while the black games' name letters representing solidarity and strength. The figures in the logo joining hands to resemble the letter 'M', which is the initial for the host city, Manchester and also a crown of the queen to represent the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II's reign as the monarch of The United Kingdom. The logo overall represents a celebration of sharing and friendship and the pride of participating in the Games, cheerful atmosphere, sportsmanship and confidence of Manchester as the games host city. The bid logo consisted of the number \"22\" and the letter \"M\" making up a smiley face.\nMascot.\nThe official mascot of the 2002 Commonwealth Games is a cat named Kit. The adoption of the cat as the games' mascot is to represent the young, vibrant, friendly, dynamic personality of Manchester as the games' host city.\nSponsors.\nNumerous companies ranging from international to local, sponsored the 2002 Games. International sponsors included Microsoft and Xerox and also companies with local links to Manchester including Guardian Media Group, PZ Cussons and United Utilities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nOfficial sites\nOther sites"}

It lies by the Ebro river and its tributaries, the Huerva and the G\u00e1llego, roughly in the centre of both Aragon and the Ebro basin.\nOn 1 January 2021, the population of the municipality of Zaragoza was 675,301 (as of 2023, the fourth most populous in Spain), on a land area of . It is the 26th most populous municipality in the European Union. The population of the metropolitan area was estimated in 2006 at 783,763 inhabitants. The municipality is home to more than 50 percent of the Aragonese population. The city lies at an elevation of about above sea level.\nZaragoza hosted Expo 2008 in mid-2008, a world's fair on water and sustainable development. It was also a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2012.\nThe city is famous for its folklore, local cuisine, and landmarks such as the Bas\u00edlica del Pilar, La Seo Cathedral and the Aljafer\u00eda Palace. Together with La Seo and the Aljafer\u00eda, several other buildings form part of the Mud\u00e9jar Architecture of Aragon which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The \"Fiestas del Pilar\" are among the most celebrated festivals in Spain.\nEtymology.\nThe Iberian town that preceded Roman colonisation was called \"Salduie\" or \"\". The Romans and Greeks called the ancient city (in Greek , ), from which derive the Arabic name (used during the Al-Andalus period), the medieval , and the modern \"Zaragoza\".\nHistory.\nThe Sedetani, a tribe of ancient Iberians, populated a village called Salduie ( in Roman sources).\nRoman Caesaraugusta.\nAugustus founded the city as \"Caesaraugusta\" between 25 BC and 11 BC as a colony to settle army veterans from the Cantabrian wars. As a Roman city, it had all the typical public buildings: forum, baths, theatre, and was an important economic centre. Many Roman ruins can still be seen in Zaragoza today.\nIt is thought it might have been the Apostle James who had built a chapel on the site of the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar.\nOn the spot where Saint Engratia and her companions were said to have been martyred on Valerian's orders was the Church of Santa Engracia de Zaragoza. Only the crypt and the doorway survived the Peninsular War. Around the early 20th century it was rebuilt, and is now a functioning parish church.\nMiddle Ages.\nDespite the general decline of the last centuries of the Roman empire, Zaragoza suffered little. Capture by the Goths in the fifth century AD was without significant bloodshed or destruction.\nIn the eighth century, following the Umayyad conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, Zaragoza became the capital of the Upper March of al-Andalus.\nIn 1018, amid the collapse of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba, Zaragoza became an independent Taifa of Zaragoza, initially controlled by the Tujibid family, then ruled by the Banu Hud from 1039. The taifa greatly prospered in a cultural and political sense in the late 11th century, and being later governed by Ahmad al-Muqtadir, Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and Al-Musta'in II. It fell to the Almoravids in 1110.\nOn 18 December 1118, Alfonso I of Aragon conquered the city from the Almoravids, and made it the capital of the Kingdom of Aragon. The aforementioned monarch created a jurisdictional dominion in the city, which was gifted to Gaston of B\u00e9arn. The city remained a lordship up until the early 13th century.\nJewish community.\nThere was a Jewish community in medieval Zaragoza, a notable center where \"yeshivas\" also incorporated the study of philosophy alongside Talmud studies. In the 11th century, the city was home to several notable Jewish physicians, including Menahem ibn al-Fawwal and Jonah ibn Janah, the latter of whom also gained renown as a Hebrew grammarian. Ibn Janah authored \"Kit\u0101b al-Talkh\u012b\u1e63\", which included detailed descriptions of drugs, weights and measures used in medicine. Another prominent figure was Jonah ibn Bikl\u0101rish, who served as court physician to Sultan Al-Musta'in II and authored \"Kit\u0101b al-Musta'\u012bn\u012b\", a drug manual written in table form that included names and properties of drugs.\nThe Jewish community of Zaragoza had seven synagogues, two of which are known by location today: \"Le Mayor\" (the main synagogue) and the synagogue \"de los Callizos\" or \"de Ceh\u00e1n.\" The community was spared from the 1391 pogroms, in large part due to the presence of the king and the intervention of the prominent Jewish leader \u1e24asdai Crescas. In 1481, the Crown appointed the monk Miguel Ferrer to enforce the segregation of Jewish households in Zaragoza, but his extreme cruelty led King Ferdinand II to remove him from the post. On 29 April 1492, the Crown's decision to expel the Jews was announced in Zaragoza to the kingdom's procurators, two days before the Edict of Expulsion was formally proclaimed in Castile. The city's rabbi, A\u00e7ach Chaqon, was ordered on 13 May to leave the Jewish quarter within a day and the kingdom within three. Most of the Jewish community eventually departed Zaragoza between 27 and 29 July, traveling to the port of Sagunto to go into exile.\nIn the months following the expulsion, the Crown and the Inquisition supervised the confiscation and transfer of communal property, including Torah scrolls, silver crowns, decorative cloths, and other ritual objects, many of which were dismantled, redistributed, or given to city authorities and religious institutions. In late 1493, Zaragoza formally received the Jewish quarter and its associated buildings.\nEarly modern history.\nAn outbreak of bubonic plague decimated the city in 1564. It reportedly killed about 10,000 people out of an estimated population of 25\u201330,000.\nIn the context of the 1701\u20131714 War of the Spanish Succession, the city rose in arms in favour of the Archduke Charles, who was proclaimed \"King of Aragon\" in the city on 29 June 1706, following the uprising of other parts of the Kingdom of Aragon in December 1705. Charles entered the city in July 1706, directing the attack on those places of Aragon that had sided with the Bourbon faction such as Borja or the Cinco Villas. Following the April 1707 battle at Almansa, the tide turned with the \"Austracist\" forces fleeing in disarray, and the Bourbon forces commanded by the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans entering the city on 26 May 1707. As he seized control of the kingdom, he began to enact the series of institutional reforms known as the Nueva Planta, abolishing the Aragonese institutions in favour of the Castilian ones. The war turned around again in 1710 after the Battle of Almenar, and, following another Bourbon defeat near Zaragoza on 20 August 1710, Archduke Charles returned to the city on the next day. This was for only a brief period, though, as following the entry of Philip V in Madrid and the ensuing Battle of Villaviciosa in December 1710, the Habsburg armies fled from Zaragoza in haste in December 1710 and Philip V proceeded to consolidate his rule over the kingdom of Aragon, resuming administrative reforms after a period of institutional void.\nAn important food riot caused by the high price of bread and other necessity goods took place in the city in April 1766, the so-called , named after the repressive agents, volunteer farmers and craftsmen who wielded swords and bucklers (). The repression left about 300 wounded, 200 detainees and 8 deaths and it was followed by 17 public executions, and an indeterminate number of killings at the dungeons of the Aljafer\u00eda.\nLate Modern history.\nZaragoza suffered two famous sieges during the Peninsular War against the Napoleonic army: a first from June to August 1808; and a second from December 1808 to February 1809, surrendering only after some 50,000 defenders had died.\nRailway transport came to Zaragoza on 16 September 1861 with the inauguration of the Barcelona\u2013Zaragoza line with the arrival of a train from the former city to the Estaci\u00f3n del Norte. The Madrid\u2013Zaragoza line was opened a year and a half later, on 16 May 1863.\nThe July 1936 coup d'\u00e9tat (with Gen. Miguel Cabanellas, Col. Monasterio, Urrutia, Sueiro, Major Cebollero and Gen.Gregorio de Benito at the centre of the Mola-led conspiration in Zaragoza) triumphed in the city. After the military uprising in Africa on 17 July, the military command easily attained its objectives in Zaragoza in the early morning of 19 July, despite the city's status as stronghold of organised labour (mostly CNT anarcho-syndicalists but also UGT trade unionists), as the civil governor critically refused to give weapons to the people in time. Many refugees, including members of the provincial committees of parties and unions, fled to Caspe, the capital of the territory of Aragon, which was still controlled by the Republic.\nThe rearguard violence committed by the putschists, with at least 12 murders on 19 July, would only go \"in crescendo\" along the beginning of the conflict. Thus one of the two big cities under Rebel control since the early stages of the Spanish Civil War along with Seville, Zaragoza profited from an increasing industrial production vis-\u00e0-vis the war economy, playing a key role for the Francoist faction as ammunition manufacturer.\nThe General Military Academy, a higher training center of the Spanish Army, was re-established on 27 September 1940 by Jos\u00e9 Enrique Varela, the Francoist Minister of the Army.\nThe 1953 Accords ensued with the installment of a joint US\u2013Spain air base in Zaragoza.\nFollowing the declaration of Zaragoza as (\"Pole for Industrial Development\") by the regime in 1964, the city doubled in population in a short time. The increase in population ran parallel to the rural flight and depopulation in the rest of Aragon.\nIn 1979, a fire at the Hotel Corona de Arag\u00f3n fire killed at least 80 people, including members of the family of Francisco Franco. The armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization ETA carried out the Zaragoza barracks bombing in 1987 which killed eleven people, including a number of children, leading to 250,000 people taking part in demonstrations in the city.\nSince 1982, the city has been home to a large factory built by General Motors for the production of Opel cars, some of which are exported to the United Kingdom and sold under the Vauxhall brand. The city took advantage of the entry of Spain into the European Communities (later European Union).\nGeography.\nLocation.\nZaragoza lies in the north-east of the Iberian Peninsula, in the rather arid depression formed by the valley of the Ebro. The Ebro cuts across the city in a west north-west by east south-east direction, entering the municipality at 205 metres above sea level and exiting the municipality at a level of 180 metres above sea level.\nThe city enjoys a beneficial location at the geographical centre of the rough hexagon formed by the Spanish cities of Bilbao, Madrid, Valencia and Barcelona and the French cities of Bordeaux and Toulouse.\nThe municipality has a surface of , making it the ninth largest municipality in Spain.\nWhile the river banks are largely flat, the territory flanking them can display a rugged terrain, featuring and escarpments. The surrounding elevations rise up to heights of about 600\u2013750 metres above sea level. The locations near the meanders of the Ebro feature some sinkholes formed upon the subsidence of the gypsum-rich soil, that can form ponds fed from irrigation water. There is also an instance of seasonal endorheic lagoon, , in the moors located in the southern part of the municipality.\nThe Roman core of Caesaraugusta was founded on the right bank of the Ebro, with the north-east corner limiting the confluence of the Ebro with the Huerva river, a modest right-bank tributary of the Ebro. The Huerva runs through the city buried for much of its lower course. Zaragoza is also located near the confluence of the Ebro with the G\u00e1llego, a more voluminous left-bank tributary born in the Pyrenees.\nClimate.\nZaragoza has a semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"BSk\"), as it lies in a wide basin entirely surrounded by mountains which block off moist air from the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The average annual precipitation is a scanty with abundant sunny days, and the rainiest seasons are spring (April\u2013May) and autumn (September\u2013November), with a relative drought in summer (July\u2013August) and winter (December\u2013March).\nTemperatures in summer are hot, and in winter a cold and dry wind blows from the northwest, the \"Cierzo\". Night frost is common and there is sporadic snowfall. Fog can be persistent in late autumn and early winter.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nZaragoza is administratively divided into 15 urban districts and 14 rural neighborhoods:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReligion.\nAccording to a survey carried out by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociol\u00f3gicas (CIS) in 2019 with a sample size of 300, 51.0% of the surveyed people described themselves as non-practising Catholic, 24.0% as practising Catholic, 6.7% as indifferent/non-believer, 5.0% as agnostic, 4.3% as atheist and 2.3% as \"other religions\", while a 6.7% did not answer.\nImmigration.\nIn 2017, there were 64,003 foreign citizens in Zaragoza, which represent 9.6% of the total population. From 2010 to 2017 immigration dropped from 87,735 to 64,003 people, a 27% drop. Romanians represent 29.8% of foreigners living in Zaragoza, or 2.9% of the total city population, followed by Moroccans (9.1%) and Chinese (7%).\nEconomy.\nAn Opel factory was opened in 1982 in Figueruelas, a small village nearby. The automotive industry is a main pillar of the regional economy along with Balay, which manufactures household appliances; CAF, which builds railway rolling stock for both the national and international markets; SAICA and Torraspapel in the stationery sector; and various other local companies, such as Pikolin, Lacasa, and Imaginarium SA. \nThe city's economy benefited from projects like the Expo 2008, the official World's Fair, whose theme was water and sustainable development, held between 14 June and 14 September 2008, (PLAZA), and the (PTR). Furthermore, since December 2003, it has been a city through which the AVE high-speed rail travels. Currently, Zaragoza Airport is a major cargo hub in the Iberian Peninsula, behind only Madrid, Barcelona, and Lisbon.\nZaragoza is home to a Spanish Air and Space Force base, which was shared with the U.S. Air Force until 1992. In English, the base was known as Zaragoza Air Base. The Spanish Air Force maintained a McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet wing at the base. No American flying wings (with the exception of a few KC-135s) were permanently based there, but it served as a training base for American fighter squadrons across Europe. It also hosts the main Spanish Army academy, \"Academia General Militar\", a number of brigades at \"San Gregorio\", and other garrisons.\nCulture.\nChristianity took root in Zaragoza at an early date. According to legend, St. Mary appeared miraculously to Saint James the Great in Zaragoza in the first century, standing on a pillar. This apparition is commemorated by a famous Catholic basilica called \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Pilar\" ('Our Lady of the Pillar').\nThe Aragonese language, in decline for centuries and restricted mostly to northern Aragon, has recently attracted more people in the region. Thus, nowadays, in Zaragoza, up to 7,000 people speak Aragonese.\nFestivals.\nThe annual \"Fiestas del Pilar\" lasts for nine days, with its main day on 12 October. This date also coincides with Spain's national holiday, El D\u00eda de la Hispanidad (Day of Hispanicity), which celebrates Spain's cultural and historical ties with Hispanic America. October 12 also corresponds to the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas.\nThere are many activities during the festival, from the massively attended (opening speech) to the final fireworks display over the Ebro; they also include marching bands, dances such as (the most popular folk music dance), a procession of \"gigantes y cabezudos\", concerts, exhibitions, \"vaquillas\", bullfights, fairground amusements, and fireworks. Some of the most important events are the , or Flower Offering to St. Mary of the Pillar, on 12 October, when an enormous surface resembling a cloak for St. Mary is covered with flowers, and the on 13 October, when all the autonomous communities of Spain offer their typical regional dishes to St. Mary and donate them to soup kitchens.\nHoly Week in Zaragoza, although not as elaborate an affair as its Andalusian or Bajo Arag\u00f3n counterparts, has several processions passing through the city centre every day with dramatic sculptures, black-dressed praying women and hundreds of hooded people playing drums. It has been a Festival of International Tourist Interest since 2014.\nEducation.\nThe University of Zaragoza is based in the city. As one of the oldest universities in Spain and a major research and development centre, this public university awards all the highest academic degrees in dozens of fields. Zaragoza is also home to the MIT-Zaragoza International Logistics Program, a unique partnership between MIT, the Government of Aragon and the University of Zaragoza.\nThere is a French international primary and secondary school, Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Moli\u00e8re de Saragosse.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe city is connected by motorway with the main cities in central and northern Spain, including Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Bilbao, all of which are located about 300 kilometres (200 miles) from Zaragoza.\nBuses.\nThe city has a network of buses which is controlled by the Urban Buses of Zaragoza (AUZSA). The network consists of 31 regular lines (two of them circle lines), two scheduled routes, six shuttle buses (one free), and seven night buses operating on Fridays, Saturdays and other festivities. Zaragoza also has an interurban bus network operated by Transport Consortium Zaragoza Area (CTAZ) that operates 17 regular lines.\nBicycle.\nZaragoza's bicycle lanes facilitate non-motorised travel and help cyclists to avoid running into pedestrians and motor vehicles. The city council also has a public bicycle-hire scheme, the , which has an annual charge.\nTram.\nThe first line of the Zaragoza tram (Valdespartera-Parque Goya) is fully operational.\nRailway.\nZaragoza is a part of the Spanish high-speed railway operated by Renfe, AVE, which connects Madrid, Lleida, Tarragona, Barcelona and Figueres via high-speed rail. Madrid can be reached in 75\u00a0minutes, and Barcelona in approximately 90\u00a0minutes. The central station is Zaragoza\u2013Delicias railway station, which serves both railway lines and coaches. In addition to long-distance railway lines and the high-speed trains, Zaragoza has a network of commuter trains operated by Renfe called \"Cercan\u00edas Zaragoza\".\nAirport.\nZaragoza Airport is located in the Garrapinillos neighbourhood, 10 kilometres from the city centre.\nIt is a major commercial airport, its freight traffic surpassing that of Barcelona El Prat in 2012, and serves as the home of the Spanish Air Force's 15th Group. It was also used by NASA as a contingency landing site for the Space Shuttle in the case of a Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL).\nPublic transportation statistics.\nThe average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Zaragoza, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 48 minutes. 9% of public transit riders ride for more than two hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 11 minutes, while 12% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is , while 5% travel over in a single direction.\nSports.\nFootball.\nZaragoza's main football team, Real Zaragoza, plays in the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n. Founded on 18 March 1932, its home games are played at La Romareda, which seats 34,596 spectators. The club has spent the majority of its history in La Liga. One of the most remarkable events in the team's recent history is the winning of the former UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1995. The team has also won the Spanish National Cup, Copa del Rey, six times: 1965, 1966, 1986, 1994, 2001 and 2004 and an Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (1964). A government survey in 2007 found that 2.7% of the Spanish population support the club, making them the seventh-most supported in the country.\nZaragoza's second football team is CD Ebro. Founded in 1942, it plays in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B \u2013 Group 2, holding home games at Campo Municipal de F\u00fatbol La Almozara, which has a capacity of 1,000 seats.\nZaragoza CFF is a Spanish women's football team from Zaragoza playing in Segunda Federaci\u00f3n Femenina, that once played in the top divisi\u00f3n.\nZaragoza was one of the Spanish cities which hosted the FIFA World Cup 1982. Three matches were played at La Romareda.\nIts current stadium (La Romareda) will be demolished and a new one will be built, as Zaragoza is expected to be one of the eleven Spanish cities to host the FIFA World Cup 2030.\nBasketball.\nThe main basketball team, Basket Zaragoza, known as \"Casademont Zaragoza\" for sponsorship reasons, plays in the Liga ACB. The Basket Zaragoza women's team also plays at the highest level in Spain, being the current finalist of the Liga Femenina Endesa. They play their home games at the Pabell\u00f3n Pr\u00edncipe Felipe with a capacity of 10,744. This pavilion will be the final venue for EuroLeague Women from 2025 to 2027.\nStadium Casablanca, a.k.a. \"Mann Filter\" for sponsorship reasons, is the Spanish women's basketball club from Zaragoza that plays in the Primera Division.\nFutsal.\nThe main futsal team, is Dlink Zaragoza, plays in the LNFS Primera Divisi\u00f3n.

{"id": "64204", "revid": "353057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64204", "title": "Kinetic theory of gases", "text": "Understanding of gas properties in terms of molecular motion\nThe kinetic theory of gases is a simple classical model of the thermodynamic behavior of gases. Its introduction allowed many principal concepts of thermodynamics to be established. It treats a gas as composed of numerous particles, too small to be seen with a microscope, in constant, random motion. These particles are now known to be the atoms or molecules of the gas. The kinetic theory of gases uses their collisions with each other and with the walls of their container to explain the relationship between the macroscopic properties of gases, such as volume, pressure, and temperature, as well as transport properties such as viscosity, thermal conductivity and mass diffusivity.\nThe basic version of the model describes an ideal gas. It treats the collisions as perfectly elastic and as the only interaction between the particles, which are additionally assumed to be much smaller than their average distance apart.\nDue to the time reversibility of microscopic dynamics (microscopic reversibility), the kinetic theory is also connected to the principle of detailed balance, in terms of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (for Brownian motion) and the Onsager reciprocal relations.\nThe theory was historically significant as the first explicit exercise of the ideas of statistical mechanics.\nHistory.\nKinetic theory of matter.\nAntiquity.\nIn about 50 BCE, the Roman philosopher Lucretius proposed that apparently static macroscopic bodies were composed on a small scale of rapidly moving atoms all bouncing off each other. This Epicurean atomistic point of view was rarely considered in the subsequent centuries, when Aristotlean ideas were dominant.\nModern era.\n\"Heat is motion\".\nOne of the first and boldest statements on the relationship between motion of particles and heat was by the English philosopher Francis Bacon in 1620. \"It must not be thought that heat generates motion, or motion heat (though in some respects this be true), but that the very essence of heat ... is motion and nothing else.\" \"not a ... motion of the whole, but of the small particles of the body.\" In 1623, in \"The Assayer\", Galileo Galilei, in turn, argued that heat, pressure, smell and other phenomena perceived by our senses are apparent properties only, caused by the movement of particles, which is a real phenomenon.\nIn 1665, in \"Micrographia\", the English polymath Robert Hooke repeated Bacon's assertion, and in 1675, his colleague, Anglo-Irish scientist Robert Boyle noted that a hammer's \"impulse\" is transformed into the motion of a nail's constituent particles, and that this type of motion is what heat consists of. Boyle also believed that all macroscopic properties, including color, taste and elasticity, are caused by and ultimately consist of nothing but the arrangement and motion of indivisible particles of matter. In a lecture of 1681, Hooke asserted a direct relationship between the temperature of an object and the speed of its internal particles. \"Heat ... is nothing but the internal Motion of the Particles of [a] Body; and the hotter a Body is, the more violently are the Particles moved.\" In a manuscript published 1720, the English philosopher John Locke made a very similar statement: \"What in our sensation is \"heat\", in the object is nothing but \"motion\".\" Locke too talked about the motion of the internal particles of the object, which he referred to as its \"insensible parts\".\nIn his 1744 paper \"Meditations on the Cause of Heat and Cold\", Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov made a relatable appeal to everyday experience to gain acceptance of the microscopic and kinetic nature of matter and heat:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Movement should not be denied based on the fact it is not seen. Who would deny that the leaves of trees move when rustled by a wind, despite it being unobservable from large distances? Just as in this case motion remains hidden due to perspective, it remains hidden in warm bodies due to the extremely small sizes of the moving particles. In both cases, the viewing angle is so small that neither the object nor their movement can be seen.Lomonosov also insisted that movement of particles is necessary for the processes of dissolution, extraction and diffusion, providing as examples the dissolution and diffusion of salts by the action of water particles on the \u201cmolecules of salt\u201d, the dissolution of metals in mercury, and the extraction of plant pigments by alcohol.\nAlso the transfer of heat was explained by the motion of particles. Around 1760, Scottish physicist and chemist Joseph Black wrote: \"Many have supposed that heat is a tremulous ... motion of the particles of matter, which ... motion they imagined to be communicated from one body to another.\"\nKinetic theory of gases.\nIn 1738 Daniel Bernoulli published \"Hydrodynamica\", which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the pressure of the gas, and that their average kinetic energy determines the temperature of the gas. The theory was not immediately accepted, in part because conservation of energy had not yet been established, and it was not obvious to physicists how the collisions between molecules could be perfectly elastic.\nPioneers of the kinetic theory, whose work was also largely neglected by their contemporaries, were Mikhail Lomonosov (1747), Georges-Louis Le Sage (ca. 1780, published 1818), John Herapath (1816) and John James Waterston (1843), which connected their research with the development of mechanical explanations of gravitation.\nIn 1856 August Kr\u00f6nig created a simple gas-kinetic model, which only considered the translational motion of the particles. In 1857 Rudolf Clausius developed a similar, but more sophisticated version of the theory, which included translational and, contrary to Kr\u00f6nig, also rotational and vibrational molecular motions. In this same work he introduced the concept of mean free path of a particle. In 1859, after reading a paper about the diffusion of molecules by Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. In his 1873 thirteen page article 'Molecules', Maxwell states: \"we are told that an 'atom' is a material point, invested and surrounded by 'potential forces' and that when 'flying molecules' strike against a solid body in constant succession it causes what is called pressure of air and other gases.\"\nIn 1871, Ludwig Boltzmann generalized Maxwell's achievement and formulated the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution. The logarithmic connection between entropy and probability was also first stated by Boltzmann.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, atoms were considered by many physicists to be purely hypothetical constructs, rather than real objects. An important turning point was Albert Einstein's (1905) and Marian Smoluchowski's (1906) papers on Brownian motion, which succeeded in making certain accurate quantitative predictions based on the kinetic theory.\nFollowing the development of the Boltzmann equation, a framework for its use in developing transport equations was developed independently by David Enskog and Sydney Chapman in 1917 and 1916. The framework provided a route to prediction of the transport properties of dilute gases, and became known as Chapman\u2013Enskog theory. The framework was gradually expanded throughout the following century, eventually becoming a route to prediction of transport properties in real, dense gases.\nAssumptions.\nThe application of kinetic theory to ideal gases makes the following assumptions:\nThus, the dynamics of particle motion can be treated classically, and the equations of motion are time-reversible.\nAs a simplifying assumption, the particles are usually assumed to have the same mass as one another; however, the theory can be generalized to a mass distribution, with each mass type contributing to the gas properties independently of one another in agreement with Dalton's law of partial pressures. Many of the model's predictions are the same whether or not collisions between particles are included, so they are often neglected as a simplifying assumption in derivations (see below).\nMore modern developments, such as the revised Enskog theory and the extended Bhatnagar\u2013Gross\u2013Krook model, relax one or more of the above assumptions. These can accurately describe the properties of dense gases, and gases with internal degrees of freedom, because they include the volume of the particles as well as contributions from intermolecular and intramolecular forces as well as quantized molecular rotations, quantum rotational-vibrational symmetry effects, and electronic excitation. While theories relaxing the assumptions that the gas particles occupy negligible volume and that collisions are strictly elastic have been successful, it has been shown that relaxing the requirement of interactions being binary and uncorrelated will eventually lead to divergent results.\nEquilibrium properties.\nPressure and kinetic energy.\nIn the kinetic theory of gases, the pressure is assumed to be equal to the force (per unit area) exerted by the individual gas atoms or molecules hitting and rebounding from the gas container's surface.\nConsider a gas particle traveling at velocity, formula_1, along the formula_2-direction in an enclosed volume with characteristic length, formula_3, cross-sectional area, formula_4, and volume, formula_5. The gas particle encounters a boundary after characteristic time\nformula_6\nThe momentum of the gas particle can then be described as\nformula_7\nWe combine the above with Newton's second law, which states that the force experienced by a particle is related to the time rate of change of its momentum, such that\nformula_8\nNow consider a large number, formula_9, of gas particles with random orientation in a three-dimensional volume. Because the orientation is random, the average particle speed, formula_10, in every direction is identical\nformula_11\nFurther, assume that the volume is symmetrical about its three dimensions, formula_12, such that\nformula_13\nThe total surface area on which the gas particles act is therefore\nformula_14\nThe pressure exerted by the collisions of the formula_9 gas particles with the surface can then be found by adding the force contribution of every particle and dividing by the interior surface area of the volume,\nformula_16\nformula_17\nThe total translational kinetic energy formula_18 of the gas is defined as\nformula_19\nproviding the result\nformula_20\nThis is an important, non-trivial result of the kinetic theory because it relates pressure, a macroscopic property, to the translational kinetic energy of the molecules, which is a microscopic property.\nThe mass density of a gas formula_21 is expressed through the total mass of gas particles and through volume of this gas: formula_22. Taking this into account, the pressure is equal to\nformula_23\nRelativistic expression for this formula is \nformula_24\nwhere formula_25 is speed of light. In the limit of small speeds, the expression becomes formula_26.\nTemperature and kinetic energy.\nRewriting the above result for the pressure as formula_27, we may combine it with the ideal gas law\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_28 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_29 is the absolute temperature defined by the ideal gas law, to obtain\nformula_30\nwhich leads to a simplified expression of the average translational kinetic energy per molecule,\nformula_31\nThe translational kinetic energy of the system is formula_9 times that of a molecule, namely formula_33. The temperature, formula_29 is related to the translational kinetic energy by the description above, resulting in\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhich becomes\nEquation (3) is one important result of the kinetic theory:\n\"The average molecular kinetic energy is proportional to the ideal gas law's absolute temperature\".\nFrom equations (1) and (3), we have\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThus, the product of pressure and volume per mole is proportional to the average\ntranslational molecular kinetic energy.\nEquations (1) and (4) are called the \"classical results\", which could also be derived from statistical mechanics;\nfor more details, see:\nThe equipartition theorem requires that kinetic energy is partitioned equally between all kinetic degrees of freedom, \"D\". A monatomic gas is axially symmetric about each spatial axis, so that \"D\" = 3 comprising translational motion along each axis. A diatomic gas is axially symmetric about only one axis, so that \"D\" = 5, comprising translational motion along three axes and rotational motion along two axes. A polyatomic gas, like water, is not radially symmetric about any axis, resulting in \"D\" = 6, comprising 3 translational and 3 rotational degrees of freedom.\nBecause the equipartition theorem requires that kinetic energy is partitioned equally, the total kinetic energy is\nformula_35\nThus, the energy added to the system per gas particle kinetic degree of freedom is\nformula_36\nTherefore, the kinetic energy per kelvin of one mole of monatomic ideal gas (\"D\" = 3) is\nformula_37\nwhere formula_38 is the Avogadro constant, and \"R\" is the ideal gas constant.\nThus, the ratio of the kinetic energy to the absolute temperature of an ideal monatomic gas can be calculated easily:\nAt standard temperature (273.15\u00a0K), the kinetic energy can also be obtained:\nAt higher temperatures (typically thousands of kelvins), vibrational modes become active to provide additional degrees of freedom, creating a temperature-dependence on \"D\" and the total molecular energy. Quantum statistical mechanics is needed to accurately compute these contributions.\nCollisions with container wall.\nFor an ideal gas in equilibrium, the rate of collisions with the container wall and velocity distribution of particles hitting the container wall can be calculated based on naive kinetic theory, and the results can be used for analyzing effusive flow rates, which is useful in applications such as the gaseous diffusion method for isotope separation.\nAssume that in the container, the number density (number per unit volume) is formula_39 and that the particles obey Maxwell's velocity distribution:\nformula_40\nThen for a small area formula_41 on the container wall, a particle with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal of the area formula_41, will collide with the area within time interval formula_45, if it is within the distance formula_46 from the area formula_41. Therefore, all the particles with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal that can reach area formula_41 within time interval formula_45 are contained in the tilted pipe with a height of formula_52 and a volume of formula_53.\nThe total number of particles that reach area formula_41 within time interval formula_45 also depends on the velocity distribution; All in all, it calculates to be:formula_56\nIntegrating this over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_57, formula_58, formula_59 yields the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time:\nformula_60\nThis quantity is also known as the \"impingement rate\" in vacuum physics. Note that to calculate the average speed formula_61 of the Maxwell's velocity distribution, one has to integrate over formula_62, formula_63, formula_59.\nThe momentum transfer to the container wall from particles hitting the area formula_41 with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal, in time interval formula_45 is:\nformula_69\nIntegrating this over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_57, formula_58, formula_59 yields the pressure (consistent with Ideal gas law):\nformula_73\nIf this small area formula_74 is punched to become a small hole, the effusive flow rate will be:\nformula_75\nCombined with the ideal gas law, this yields\nformula_76\nThe above expression is consistent with Graham's law.\nTo calculate the velocity distribution of particles hitting this small area, we must take into account that all the particles with formula_77 that hit the area formula_41 within the time interval formula_45 are contained in the tilted pipe with a height of formula_80 and a volume of formula_81; Therefore, compared to the Maxwell distribution, the velocity distribution will have an extra factor of formula_82:\nformula_83\nwith the constraint formula_84, formula_58, formula_59. The constant formula_87 can be determined by the normalization condition formula_88 to be formula_89, and overall:\nformula_90\nSpeed of molecules.\nFrom the kinetic energy formula it can be shown that\nformula_91\nformula_92\nformula_93\nwhere \"v\" is in m/s, \"T\" is in kelvin, and \"m\" is the mass of one molecule of gas in kg. The most probable (or mode) speed formula_94 is 81.6% of the root-mean-square speed formula_95, and the mean (arithmetic mean, or average) speed formula_61 is 92.1% of the rms speed (isotropic distribution of speeds).\nSee:\nMean free path.\nIn kinetic theory of gases, the mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision. Let formula_97 be the collision cross section of one molecule colliding with another. As in the previous section, the number density formula_98 is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume, or formula_99. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is formula_100, and it is related to the mean free path formula_101 byformula_102\nNotice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume formula_100 is reciprocal of length.\nTransport properties.\nThe kinetic theory of gases deals not only with gases in thermodynamic equilibrium, but also very importantly with gases not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This means using Kinetic Theory to consider what are known as \"transport properties\", such as viscosity, thermal conductivity, mass diffusivity and thermal diffusion.\nIn its most basic form, kinetic gas theory is only applicable to dilute gases. The extension of kinetic gas theory to dense gas mixtures, Revised Enskog Theory, was developed in 1983-1987 by E. G. D. Cohen, J. M. Kincaid and M. L\u00f2pez de Haro, building on work by H.\u2008van Beijeren and M. H.\u2008Ernst.\nViscosity and kinetic momentum.\nIn books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that are used in many fields. Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a Couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force \"F\". The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component formula_104 which increase uniformly with distance formula_105 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.\nInside a dilute gas in a Couette flow setup, let formula_106 be the forward velocity of the gas at a horizontal flat layer (labeled as formula_107); formula_106 is along the horizontal direction. The number of molecules arriving at the area formula_41 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal, in time interval formula_45 is\nformula_113\nThese molecules made their last collision at formula_114, where formula_101 is the mean free path. Each molecule will contribute a forward momentum of\nformula_116\nwhere plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the forward velocity gradient formula_117 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.\nIntegrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_57, formula_58, formula_59 yields the forward momentum transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as shear stress):\nformula_121\nThe net rate of momentum per unit area that is transported across the imaginary surface is thus\nformula_122\nCombining the above kinetic equation with Newton's law of viscosity\nformula_123\ngives the equation for shear viscosity, which is usually denoted formula_124 when it is a dilute gas:\nformula_125\nCombining this equation with the equation for mean free path gives\nformula_126\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution gives the average (equilibrium) molecular speed as\nformula_127\nwhere formula_128 is the most probable speed. We note that\nformula_129\nand insert the velocity in the viscosity equation above. This gives the well known equation (with formula_130 subsequently estimated below) for shear viscosity for dilute gases:\nformula_131\nand formula_132 is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the transport of momentum through the gas due to the translational motion of molecules is much larger than the transport due to momentum being transferred between molecules during collisions. The transfer of momentum between molecules is explicitly accounted for in Revised Enskog theory, which relaxes the requirement of a gas being dilute. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by\nformula_133\nThe radius formula_134 is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter formula_135 is called collision cross section diameter or kinetic diameter of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. The radius for zero Lennard-Jones potential may then be used as a rough estimate for the kinetic radius. However, using this estimate will typically lead to an erroneous temperature dependency of the viscosity. For such interaction potentials, significantly more accurate results are obtained by numerical evaluation of the required collision integrals.\nThe expression for viscosity obtained from Revised Enskog Theory reduces to the above expression in the limit of infinite dilution, and can be written as\nformula_136\nwhere formula_137 is a term that tends to zero in the limit of infinite dilution that accounts for excluded volume, and formula_138 is a term accounting for the transfer of momentum over a non-zero distance between particles during a collision.\nThermal conductivity and heat flux.\nFollowing a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for thermal conductivity of a dilute gas:\nConsider two parallel plates separated by a gas layer. Both plates have uniform temperatures, and are so massive compared to the gas layer that they can be treated as thermal reservoirs. The upper plate has a higher temperature than the lower plate. The molecules in the gas layer have a molecular kinetic energy formula_139 which increases uniformly with distance formula_105 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium energy flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.\nLet formula_141 be the molecular kinetic energy of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area formula_41 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal, in time interval formula_45 is\nformula_146\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance formula_147 above and below the gas layer, and each will contribute a molecular kinetic energy of\nformula_148\nwhere formula_149 is the specific heat capacity. Again, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the temperature gradient formula_150 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.\nIntegrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_62, formula_58, formula_59 yields the energy transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as heat flux):\nformula_154\nNote that the energy transfer from above is in the formula_155 direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net heat flux across the imaginary surface is thus\nformula_156\nCombining the above kinetic equation with Fourier's law\nformula_157\ngives the equation for thermal conductivity, which is usually denoted formula_158 when it is a dilute gas:\nformula_159\nSimilarly to viscosity, Revised Enskog theory yields an expression for thermal conductivity that reduces to the above expression in the limit of infinite dilution, and which can be written as\nformula_160\nwhere formula_161 is a term that tends to unity in the limit of infinite dilution, accounting for excluded volume, and formula_162 is a term accounting for the transfer of energy across a non-zero distance between particles during a collision.\nDiffusion coefficient and diffusion flux.\nFollowing a similar logic as above, one can derive the kinetic model for mass diffusivity of a dilute gas:\nConsider a steady diffusion between two regions of the same gas with perfectly flat and parallel boundaries separated by a layer of the same gas. Both regions have uniform number densities, but the upper region has a higher number density than the lower region. In the steady state, the number density at any point is constant (that is, independent of time). However, the number density formula_163 in the layer increases uniformly with distance formula_105 above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium molecular flow is superimposed on a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.\nLet formula_165 be the number density of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the layer. The number of molecules arriving at an area formula_41 on one side of the gas layer, with speed formula_42 at angle formula_43 from the normal, in time interval formula_45 is\nformula_170\nThese molecules made their last collision at a distance formula_147 above and below the gas layer, where the local number density is\nformula_172\nAgain, plus sign applies to molecules from above, and minus sign below. Note that the number density gradient formula_173 can be considered to be constant over a distance of mean free path.\nIntegrating over all appropriate velocities within the constraint formula_57, formula_175, formula_59 yields the molecular transfer per unit time per unit area (also known as diffusion flux):\nformula_177\nNote that the molecular transfer from above is in the formula_155 direction, and therefore the overall minus sign in the equation. The net diffusion flux across the imaginary surface is thus\nformula_179\nCombining the above kinetic equation with Fick's first law of diffusion\nformula_180\ngives the equation for mass diffusivity, which is usually denoted formula_181 when it is a dilute gas:\nformula_182\nThe corresponding expression obtained from Revised Enskog Theory may be written as\nformula_183\nwhere formula_184 is a factor that tends to unity in the limit of infinite dilution, which accounts for excluded volume and the variation chemical potentials with density.\nDetailed balance.\nFluctuation and dissipation.\nThe kinetic theory of gases entails that due to the microscopic reversibility of the gas particles' detailed dynamics, the system must obey the principle of detailed balance. Specifically, the fluctuation-dissipation theorem applies to the Brownian motion (or diffusion) and the drag force, which leads to the Einstein\u2013Smoluchowski equation:\nformula_185 where\nNote that the mobility \"\u03bc\" = \"v\"d/\"F\" can be calculated based on the viscosity of the gas; Therefore, the Einstein\u2013Smoluchowski equation also provides a relation between the mass diffusivity and the viscosity of the gas.\nOnsager reciprocal relations.\nThe mathematical similarities between the expressions for shear viscocity, thermal conductivity and diffusion coefficient of the ideal (dilute) gas is not a coincidence; It is a direct result of the Onsager reciprocal relations (i.e. the detailed balance of the reversible dynamics of the particles), when applied to the convection (matter flow due to temperature gradient, and heat flow due to pressure gradient) and advection (matter flow due to the velocity of particles, and momentum transfer due to pressure gradient) of the ideal (dilute) gas.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The river rises in the Montes Universales between Cuenca and Teruel, in mid-eastern Spain, flows , generally westward, and empties into the Atlantic Ocean at Lisbon.\nName.\nThe river's Latin name is \"Tagus\". While the etymology is unclear, the most probable etymological origin for the hydronym \"Tagus\" is Indo-European *(s)tag- ('to drip').\nGeography.\nSource.\nThe Tagus River originates at an elevation of 1,593 meters above sea level in a place known as Fuente Garc\u00eda, within the municipality of Fr\u00edas de Albarrac\u00edn in Teruel, Spain. Its source is located between the Muela de San Juan (1,830 m) and Cerro de San Felipe (1,839 m), in the Sierra de Albarrac\u00edn, which belongs to the Montes Universales in the western branch of the Iberian System.\nCourse.\nThe river flows through Spain for , passing through four autonomous communities (Arag\u00f3n, Castilla-La Mancha, Madrid, and Extremadura) and a total of six provinces (Teruel, Guadalajara, Cuenca, Madrid, Toledo, and C\u00e1ceres). After forming a border between Spain and Portugal, it enters Portugal. In Portugal, it flows for through the traditional regions of Beira Baixa, Alto Alentejo, Ribatejo, and Estremadura, which include the districts of Castelo Branco, Portalegre, Santar\u00e9m, Lisbon, and Set\u00fabal.\nThe most important cities along its course are Aranjuez, Toledo, and Talavera de la Reina in Spain; and Abrantes, Santar\u00e9m, and Lisbon in Portugal.\nBasin.\nThe Tagus basin has a total area of . It is the most populated basin in the Iberian Peninsula, with more than ten million inhabitants. It includes the Madrid metropolitan area and the Lisbon region. The Tagus basin has a total reservoir capacity of around .\nGeology.\nThe lower Tagus region in Portugal is a seismically active area. Major earthquakes in the Lower Tagus include those of 1309, 1531, 1755, and 1909.\nEstuary.\nThe Tagus river is one of the few rivers in the world to have an inverted delta. Its delta is wider at the beginning and narrows down as it approaches the sea, contrary to a typical delta. This is because it flows into the sea through a small opening in a valley. Although due to sedimentation, this delta is now only very partially inverted, with the valley now mostly filled with sediment. The delta is about wide and long, but its exit into the sea is only wide. It thus forms a large lagoon with large and very shallow sand banks which go uncovered during low tides. The delta used to be even bigger thousands of years ago.\nHydrology.\nThe hydrological regime of the Tagus is determined by the rain and snow variations typical of the central region of the Iberian Peninsula, especially in reference to the mountain formations integrated here. The river's major floods usually occur from January to April, with an absolute maximum in March (when thawing occurs), while the lowest flows occur between July and October, with a minimum in September.\nThis results in a very irregular course, with strong flow oscillations. As it passes through Alc\u00e1ntara (C\u00e1ceres), these range from in February and March to in August and September.\nThis regime has been altered in the second half of the 20th century as a result of the construction of different engineering works, aimed at regulating its basin for five main uses: drinking water supply, irrigation, water diversion to an external basin (that of the Segura River), electricity production, and cooling of nuclear power plants.\nEcology.\nThe banks and areas of influence of the Tagus are home to relevant flora and fauna, representative of the central region of the Iberian Peninsula. The high degree of depopulation in some areas integrated into its basin, such as its upper and middle-lower course, has allowed the preservation of places of great ecological interest. Some of them have been legally protected, such as the Alto Tajo Nature Park (Guadalajara and Cuenca), the Monfrag\u00fce National Park (C\u00e1ceres), and the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve, near Lisbon. Around the course of the river, four endangered animal species live: the Iberian lynx, the Spanish imperial eagle, the black stork, and the black vulture.\nHistorical importance.\nIn addition to its geographical relevance, the Tagus has great historical importance, resulting from its connection with Toledo and Lisbon, two of the cities with the greatest weight and historical journey in the Iberian Peninsula. The first was built on a hill about 100 m high, around the meander known as Torno del Tajo, which preserved it from possible attacks and incursions.\nFrom the Late Middle Ages, the mouth of the Tagus articulated an intense commercial activity between Northern Europe and the Mediterranean. From the Renaissance, it was the main communications hub of the Portuguese Empire, which extended through America, Africa, and Asia.\nRecreational uses.\nThe nearly of the Alto Tajo canyon as it passes through the natural park of the same name offer one of the best options for practicing whitewater canoeing in the central peninsula. Several adventure companies offer this activity in the vicinity of Poveda de la Sierra and Ocentejo. In the flat water modality, canoeing can be practiced in the Entrepe\u00f1as and Bolarque reservoirs. There are also important flat water canoeing clubs in Aranjuez and Talavera de la Reina.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Incorporating both physical and artistic elements, it was created in Japan in the 1960s. Its roots lay in the traditional Japanese martial arts, Chinese medicine and Buddhist meditation techniques, while its creator Hiroyuki Aoki was also influenced by modern Western art and Christianity.\nAs well as being a practical martial art Shintaido aims to be a form of artistic expression, a healthy exercise, and a path of self-discovery and transformation.\nShintaido is practised with bare hands, but the curriculum also includes bojutsu (\u68d2\u8853), involving the use of the long staff (or b\u014d, \u68d2), and kenjutsu (\u5263\u8853), using a wooden sword (or bokuto, \u6728\u5200).\nOrigins.\nBud\u014d for the modern age.\nHiroyuki Aoki's spiritual and artistic aspirations were not satisfied by karate as it existed in the 1960s. Striving for beauty and peace, he was searching for \u2018both soft and expansive movement, spreading out to the ends of the earth \u2013 and power which could be used comfortably without turning against nature or the body.\u2019\nWhile studying karate under Shigeru Egami, he created his own research group which, as well as including karate practitioners, included others who had abandoned it as being too severe and unsparing, and also people with physical limitations. Then in 1964 he reached his goal of discovering a way of moving the body in a more natural, beautiful and effective manner. Yet he believed it might have taken a beginner 20 years of study to achieve this kind of movement. If it were to spearhead the new culture that he aspired for, Aoki realised that he needed system that could be learned relatively easily. He wanted to create an entire martial art that would convince the public at large \u2013 but one capable of revitalising both the body and the spirit, giving energy, refreshment and the hope of living a more colourful life, of restoring the soul day by day.\nAoki has said that he wanted to bring martial arts to the same level of attainment as the works of great Western artists such as Beethoven, Van Gogh or Dostoyevsky, or the American writers he admired, notably Henry Miller, Jackson Pollock or Walt Whitman.\nRakutenkai (\u697d\u5929\u4f1a).\nTo this end, on 23 September 1965, he collected an informal group around him which he called \u2018Rakutenkai\u2019, which had as its aim to \"pursue truth in daily life, acquire perfect liberty, live within the light of liberty, and become the light of the world\".\nThe only requirement was that members should practise with the group at least twice a year; among its members were active high-ranking martial artists, others who had given up their practice, women, children, old people and people with physical disabilities. Aoki wanted even the least strong people to be able to enjoy the fruits of his study even though the traditional processes of the martial arts tended to be selective and exclusive. From his own experience and careful study of the texts, Aoki believed that anyone, if properly supported, could reveal him- or herself as a \u2018living treasure\u2019. So he set the group five rules:\n(the last was left blank, to be filled in by each person according to their own beliefs).\nFrom this group he chose a team of around 30 instructors to conduct deep research into technique. From their experimental practice, Hiroyuki Aoki selected certain movements and techniques, and introduced them into his new system. Three fundamental kata emerged during this period: Tenshingoso (which Aoki had created by April 1966), Eiko (which the Rakutenkai discovered during a late-night practice on 1 December 1966; and Hikari (see below). In 1970 he set up his own school, Sogobudo (holistic martial art) Renmei, to revive traditional Bud\u014d by developing and teaching Shintaido.\nAfter Rakutenkai had been disbanded a number of Aoki's leading practitioners and teachers, who had helped him create Shintaido, left the group. Among these were Master Egamis son Masatake Egami, Kato Tomorori, Hokari Shikoh and his brother, Ito Juguro, Toshima Shigeiko and Chieko Kato. With this passing much of the creative energy left the Shintaido organisation and practice.\nClaimed Benefits.\nShintaido assumes that the challenges facing modern people are more rooted in emotional and psychological matters than physical. Shintaido offers body movements that aim to build resources to live better and develop a new 'way of being' that is more intuitive, aware, and less tense; this stems from the belief that the freer the body, the more effective its movements can be.\nThe hope of founder Hiroyuki Aoki was to create a martial art that could reach the level of great art. so beauty and fluidity are essential aspects. The practice of Shintaido brings with it a bodily awareness and receptivity to the many messages the body transmits so that it can be used as a tool to explore the individual's inner state of being, evolution, limitations and resources. The partner exercises aim to provide an opportunity to discover and develop the ability to communicate and affirm oneself. The dojo (\u9053\u5834, \"practice space\") is a place in which to explore this concept in safety.\nBasic Forms.\nEvery Shintaido practice begins with warming-up exercises designed to soften and extend the body until it can move naturally, without the tensions of everyday life. This may be followed by a period of more vigorous exercises, designed to open of the body. These exercises, like everything in Shintaido, are based on effective martial arts technique.\nMost of these exercises can be practised alone, with a single partner or in a group; they can be performed dynamically, formally or slowly and meditatively. Some require use of the voice.\nTenshingoso (\u5929\u771f\u4e94\u76f8).\nTenshingoso \"(five expressions of cosmic truth)\" is one of the essential forms (or kata, \u578b) of Shintaido. Its significance can vary depending on the context in which it is performed. As a martial technique, it is a distillation of all the principal techniques (attacks, cuts and throws) of bud\u014d. As an artistic symbol, it is a metaphor of the life-cycle, from birth to death. As a technique of personal development, it is an encyclopedia of meditation positions (mudras).\nEiko (\u6804\u5149).\nAdapted from the art of swordsmanship, Eiko \"(glory)\" is a hymn to the glory of the human adventure, taking the practitioner between earth and heaven, ideal and reality. If done with conviction, it can bring practitioners out of their \u2018small world\u2019 and plunge them into a whirl of new sensations. To do Eiko is open up the space around and within oneself; with a partner, it develops a sense of timing, concentration and gives a chance to go far beyond one's normal limits.\nHikari (\u5149).\nHikari \"(playing with light)\", though virtually indescribable, can be considered Shintaido's artistic masterpiece. It is a unique form of personal expression: its movements are totally free, so it has no form, and cannot be taught.\nIn Wakame taiso (\u308f\u304b\u3081\u4f53\u64cd, \"seaweed exercise\") two people, face to face, alternately take the role of the seaweed and the ocean. The seaweed, rooted on the seabed, waves sinuously in response to the gentle touch of the ocean around it. This exercise can quickly induce a state of deep intensity. It also helps develop a sensitivity to attack and allows a fluid, centred response.\nTaimyo (\u5927\u5999).\nThe gentlest and most recent of the Shintaido kata, Taimyo \"(great mystery)\" was developed to allow older, less robust people or pregnant women to build up their strength and experience the beauty of Shintaido practice. A long and gentle kata, it contains elements of many aspects of Shintaido practice, has a therapeutic dimension, and builds a state of deep meditation.\nFrom relaxation and stretching to openness and freedom.\nThe first objective of Shintaido is to make the body and mind completely relaxed, fluid and flexible. Next it develops large movements through which we can express our vital energy and talents. Many exercises open the body, especially the hips, the stomach, chest and hands. Practitioners aim to develop an open spirit with which to approach life at large, and other people. Kumite (\u7d44\u307f\u624b, \"partner practices\") allow us to test the effectiveness of the techniques we have learned: an open body, large movements and clear intention make the techniques effective. There is no competition. Each participant is encouraged to express him or herself freely and to discover his or her potential in a spirit of cooperation with, respect for and confidence in one another. A kumite may begin with a formal movement but is transformed progressively into a kind of free dance between two partners.\nApplied Shintaido.\nShintaido bojutsu (\u65b0\u68d2\u8853).\nThe bojutsu curriculum is one of the most popular aspects of Shintaido, and for many people provided and point first contact. Students use a long staff (or b\u014d, \u68d2) to extend their movement, and later progress to the more difficult short staff (or j\u014d, \u6756).\nBeginners study a range of basic movements as well as three short kata which are based on traditional Japanese bojutsu practice. These kata are:\nThere is also a kumibo kata called shinjo (\u771f\u5e38), offered in sho (\u5c0f, \"correct, or formal\") &amp; dai (\u5927, \"big, or expressive\") forms.\nAdvanced students (from shodan and above) study the 3 long kata from which the basic kata were derived. At the highest level there is a longer kata (known colloquially as \"Go Down Moses\") in which all 3 kata are combined into a single form.\nShintaido karate (\u65b0\u7a7a\u624b).\nThe Shintaido karate curriculum is based on a cut down version of the shotokai karate curriculum, which is the school run by Egami sensei at the time Shintaido was created. The study of karate is meant to complement the study of Shintaido itself, and is most often taken up by Shintaido students of many years experience who wish to study the history and origins of Shintaido movement. Beginners study two taikyoku (\u592a\u6975) and two heian (\u5e73\u5b89) katas (each is offered in sho &amp; dai forms) as well as variety of strikes, kicks and kumite arrangements. Advanced students (from shodan and above) study a range of traditional karate kata, culminating in a revisiting of the original taikyoku kata at the highest level.\nCurriculum and organisation.\nShintaido offers five Dan (\u6bb5, \"higher level\") grades: currently just four people in the world hold the highest grade (5th Dan). On average it takes ten years of practice to reach 1st Dan (the grade of Shintaido instructor). Equivalent grades are also offered in the Shintaido forms of bojutsu &amp; karate.\nIn Europe Kyu (\u7d1a, \"lower level\") examinations are conducted in each country. For 1st Dan and above, they are held at a European workshop organised by the European Shintaido College (ESC). Exams of 3rd Dan and above are held at international festivals held every four years at varying locations around the world.\nThe International Shintaido College (ISC) is the main organisation of Shintaido instructors. It meets every four years, when it also holds exams, of 3rd dan and above. Its Technical Committee (ISC-TC) comprises nine members, drawn from Shintaido's three regions: Europe, the Americas (including Australia) and Japan. This committee aims to harmonise practice and technique around the world.\nJapan, the country of Shintaido's origin, has many instructors, most working within a national organisation (NPO). In the Western hemisphere, Shintaido is practised in USA, Canada and Brazil. The US instructors operate under the auspices of Shintaido of America. In Europe, The European Shintaido College (ESC) includes most of the Shintaido instructors in Europe, based in Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Britain, Italy, the Czech Republic and Switzerland. ESC meets annually at a \u2018forum\u2019, when exams of 1st and 2nd Dan are also held. The European Technical Committee (ETC) oversees the examinations and establishes the curriculum for all examinations in Europe. Kyu grade exams can be held nationally or locally, twice a year.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Corral", "text": "1881 shootout in Tombstone, Arizona, United States\nThe gunfight at the O.K. Corral pitted lawmen against members of a loosely organized group of cattle rustlers and horse thieves called the Cochise County Cowboys on October 26, 1881. While lasting less than a minute, the gunfight has been the subject of books and films into the 21st century. Taking place in the town of Tombstone in Arizona Territory, the battle has become one archetype of the American Old West. The gunfight was the result of a long-simmering feud between five outlaws (including two sets of brothers) and four representatives of the law, including three brothers. The trigger for the event was the local marshal's decision to enforce a city ordinance that prohibited the carrying of weapons into town. To enforce that ordinance, the lawmen would have to disarm the Cowboys.\nThe lawmen were three brothers, Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp, and Wyatt\u2019s close friend Doc Holliday. As Deputy U.S. Marshal and Town Marshal, Virgil was in charge, and it was his decision to enforce the ordinance that led to the shoot out. His two brothers and Doc Holliday were temporary assistant marshals. The Cowboys were a loosely connected group of outlaws. In Tombstone at the time of the gunfight were five members of the Cowboys: Billy Claiborne, brothers Ike and Billy Clanton, and brothers Tom and Frank McLaury. Despite its name, the gunfight did not take place within or next to the O.K. Corral, which fronted Allen Street and had a rear entrance lined with horse stalls on Fremont Street. The shootout actually took place in a narrow lot on the side of C. S. Fly's photography studio on Fremont Street, six doors west of the O.K. Corral's rear entrance. Some members of the two opposing parties were initially only about apart. About thirty shots were fired in thirty seconds. During that brief battle, three men were killed, three were wounded, two ran away, and one fought but was unharmed. Ike Clanton subsequently filed murder charges against the Earps and Holliday. After a thirty-day preliminary hearing and a brief stint in jail, the defendants were shown to have acted lawfully.\nThe gunfight was not the end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil was ambushed and maimed in a murder attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, a Cowboy fired from a dark alley through the glass door of Campbell &amp; Hatch's saloon and billiard parlor, killing Morgan. The suspects in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt, newly appointed as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's killing of Frank Stilwell.\nThe gunfight was not widely known until two years after Wyatt Earp's death, when Stuart Lake published his 1931 book \"\". The book was the basis for the 1939 film \"Frontier Marshal\", with Randolph Scott and Cesar Romero, the 1946 film \"My Darling Clementine\", directed by John Ford, and the 1957 film \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\", after which the shootout became known by that name. The shootout was also depicted in the 1993 film \"Tombstone\" and the next year in Kevin Costner's less well received film \"Wyatt Earp\". Since then, the conflict has been portrayed with varying degrees of accuracy in numerous Western films and books, and has become an archetype for much of the popular imagery associated with the Old West.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBackground.\nTombstone, located in Arizona Territory about from the Mexican border, was founded in March 1879 after silver was discovered in the area. Like many mining boomtowns on the American frontier, Tombstone grew rapidly. At its founding, it had a population of just 100, and only two years later, in late 1881, the population was more than 7,000 (excluding Chinese, Mexicans, women, and children), making it the largest boomtown in the American Southwest.\nSilver mining and its attendant wealth attracted many professionals and merchants, who brought their wives and families. With them came churches and ministers. By 1881 the town boasted fancy restaurants, a bowling alley, four churches, an ice house, a school, an opera house, two banks, three newspapers, and an ice cream parlor, along with 110 saloons, fourteen gambling halls, and numerous brothels, all situated among a number of dirty, hardscrabble mines.\nHorse rustlers and bandits from the countryside often came to town, and shootings were frequent. In the 1880s, the theft of cattle and the smuggling of alcohol and tobacco across the border were common. The Mexican government assessed heavy export taxes on these items, and smugglers earned a handsome profit by stealing them in Mexico and selling them in Tombstone.\nJames, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, when the town was mostly composed of tents as living quarters, a few saloons and other buildings, and the mines. Virgil had been hired as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County, with his offices in Tombstone, only days before his arrival. In June 1881 he was also appointed as Tombstone's town marshal (or police chief).\nThough not universally liked by the townspeople, the Earp brothers tended to protect the interests of the town's business owners and residents; even so, Wyatt helped protect outlaw \"Curly Bill\" Brocius from being lynched after he accidentally killed Tombstone town marshal Fred White. In contrast, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan was generally sympathetic to the interests of the rural ranchers and members of the loosely organized outlaw group called the Cochise County Cowboys, or simply the Cowboys, to which Brocius belonged. (In that time and region, the term \"cowboy\" generally meant an outlaw; legitimate cowmen were instead referred to as \"cattle herders\" or \"ranchers\".)\nConflicting versions of events.\nMany of the sources describing the events leading up to the gunfight and details of the gunfight itself conflict with each other. Newspapers of the day were not above taking sides, and news reporting often editorialized on issues to reflect the publisher's interests. John Clum, publisher of \"The Tombstone Epitaph\", had helped organize a \"Committee of Safety\" (a vigilance committee) in Tombstone in late September 1881. He was elected as Tombstone's first mayor under the new city charter that year.\nClum and his newspaper tended to side with the interests of local business owners and supported Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp. Harry Woods, the publisher of the other major newspaper, \"The Daily Nugget\", was an undersheriff to Behan. He and his newspaper tended to side with Behan, the Cowboys (some of whom were part-time ranchers and landowners) and the rural interests of the ranchers.\nMuch of what is known of the event is based on month-long preliminary hearings held afterward, generally known as the Spicer hearings. Reporters from both newspapers covered the hearings and recorded the testimony there and at the coroner's inquest, but only the reporter from the \"Nugget\" knew shorthand. The testimony recorded by the court recorder and the two newspapers varied greatly.\nAccording to the Earps' version of events, the fight was in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in violation of local ordinance, defied a lawful order to hand over their weapons and drew their pistols instead. The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offered no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who was telling the truth was difficult then and remains so to this day.\nThough usually opposing each other in their depiction of events, reporting by both the \"Epitaph\" and the \"Nugget\" initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy \"Nugget\", was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The \"Nugget\" staff had a close relationship with Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the \"Nugget\" the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' account. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony.\nSubsequent stories about the gunfight published in the \"Nugget\" after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the \"Epitaph\" countered the \"Nugget\"'s later view entirely and supported the lawmen. Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their deaths, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could not have been in the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.\nPart-time newspaper reporter Howell \"Pat\" Hayhurst transcribed the testimony from the hearings in the early 1930s as part of a Federal Writers' Project, which was part of the Works Progress Administration. According to one report, Hayhurst was a friend of the Behan family. After he completed his transcription, he kept the original document in his home, where it was destroyed in a house fire.\nOrigins of the conflict.\nEarps versus Cowboys.\nThe interpersonal conflicts and feuds leading to the gunfight were complex. Each side had strong family ties. The brothers James, Virgil, Wyatt, Morgan, and Warren Earp were a tight-knit family, working together as lawmen, pimps, and saloon owners in several frontier towns, among other occupations, and had moved together from one town to another. Virgil served in the Union Army during the American Civil War and in 1877 became a police officer in Prescott, Arizona Territory. He followed that with a job as a night watchman before he became a constable. Wyatt had held jobs as either a guard or police officer in the cattle-drive towns of Wichita and Dodge City, \nKansas.\nJames, Virgil, and Wyatt Earp, together with their wives, arrived in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, during the early period of rapid growth associated with mining, when there were only a few hundred residents. Virgil was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal shortly before he arrived in town. In the summer of 1880, Morgan and Warren Earp also moved to Tombstone. Wyatt arrived hoping he could leave \"lawing\" behind. He bought a stagecoach, only to find the business was already very competitive. The Earps invested together in several mining claims and water rights. The Earps were Republicans and Northerners who had never worked as cowmen or ranchers.\nThe Earps quickly came into conflict with Frank and Tom McLaury, Billy and Ike Clanton, Johnny Ringo, and William \"Curly Bill\" Brocius, among others. They were part of a large, loose association of cattle smugglers and horse thieves known as the Cowboys, outlaws who had been implicated in various crimes. Ike Clanton was prone to drinking heavily and threatened the Earp brothers numerous times.\nTombstone resident George Parson wrote in his diary, \"A Cowboy is a rustler at times, and a rustler is a synonym for desperado\u2014bandit, outlaw, and horse thief.\" The \"San Francisco Examiner\" wrote in an editorial, \"Cowboys [are] the most reckless class of outlaws in that wild country ... infinitely worse than the ordinary robber.\" During the 1880s in Cochise County, it was an insult to call a legitimate cattleman a \"Cowboy\". The Cowboys teamed up for various crimes and came to each other's aid. Virgil thought that some of the Cowboys had met at Charleston and taken \"an oath over blood drawn from the arm of Johnny Ringo, the leader, that they would kill us.\"\nThe Earps as lawmen.\nAmong the lawmen involved in the O.K. Corral shooting, only Virgil had any real experience in combat. Virgil had been constable in Prescott and was the deputy United States Marshal in Tombstone. He was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County by U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake, on November 27, 1879, before the Earps arrived in Tombstone on December 1. He was appointed as Tombstone's acting town marshal on September 30, 1880, after popular Tombstone town marshal Fred White was accidentally shot and killed by Brocius. Wyatt had been a deputy city marshal in Kansas, as well as deputy sheriff in Tombstone.\nOnly six weeks later, Virgil ran for the office on November 12, 1880, but lost to Ben Sippy. However, on June 6, 1881, Sippy asked for a two-week leave of absence. The city soon discovered $3,000 () in financial improprieties in Sippy's records. A few days later Virgil was appointed as town marshal in his place. At the time of the gunfight, Virgil was both Deputy U.S. Marshal and town marshal. The city suspended him as town marshal after Ike Clanton filed murder charges.\nAfter Wyatt first arrived in Tombstone, his business efforts yielded little profit, and he took a job as a stagecoach shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo, guarding shipments of silver bullion. On July 28, 1880, Wyatt was appointed Pima County Deputy Sheriff. He held this position for only three months, until after the election of November 9, 1880, when he resigned. When Virgil was maimed by an assassination attempt, Wyatt was appointed Deputy U.S. Marshal in his place. He held that position until he left Cochise County in April 1882.\nWyatt was an imposing, handsome man: blond, tall, weighing , broad-shouldered, long-armed, and muscular. He had been a boxer and was reputed to be an expert with a pistol. According to author Leo Silva, Earp showed no fear of any man.\nWyatt had been an assistant marshal when he and policeman James Masterson, along with a few other citizens, fired their pistols at several cowboys who were fleeing town after shooting up a theater. A member of the group, George Hoyt (sometimes spelled Hoy), was shot in the arm and died of his wound a month later. Wyatt always claimed to have been the one to shoot Hoyt, although it could have been anyone among the lawmen. Wyatt had developed a reputation as a no-nonsense, hard-nosed lawman, but prior to the gunfight he had been involved in only one other shooting, in Dodge City, Kansas, during the summer of 1878.\nThe 1931 book \"\" was a best-selling biography by Stuart N. Lake. It established Wyatt Earp's role as a fearless lawman in the American Old West and the legend of the \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" in the public consciousness. But Lake and many others in the popular media wildly exaggerated Wyatt's role as the central figure in the gunfight. It was only discovered much later that \"Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal\", based on eight interviews with Earp, was largely fictional. The book and later Hollywood portrayals embellished Wyatt's reputation and magnified his mystique as a western lawman.\nMorgan Earp had been a police officer in Montana, but had no known experience with gunfighting prior to their arrival in Tombstone. While Wyatt was Pima County Deputy Sheriff on July 27, 1880, Morgan Earp took over his job as shotgun messenger for Wells Fargo. Morgan also occasionally assisted Virgil and at the time of the gunfight was a special deputy policeman and drawing pay.\nDoc Holliday had a reputation as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls whom he wanted to take with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for murder but acquitted, mostly based on the testimony of Webb.\nHolliday had saved Wyatt Earp's life at one time and had become a close friend. He had been living in Prescott, Arizona Territory and making a living as a gambler since late 1879. There, he first met future Tombstone sheriff Johnny Behan, a sometime gambler and saloon owner. In late September 1880, Holliday followed the Earps to Tombstone.\nRural Cowboys vs. Tombstone interests.\nThe ranch owned by Newman Haynes Clanton near Charleston, Arizona was believed to be the local center for the Cowboys' illegal activities. Tom and Frank McLaury worked with the rustlers buying and selling stolen cattle.\nMany of the rural ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing influence of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained control of the country outside Tombstone, due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.\nRelevant law in Tombstone.\nTo reduce crime in Tombstone, on April 19, 1881, the city council passed ordinance 9, requiring anyone carrying a bowie knife, dirk, pistol or rifle to deposit their weapons at a livery or saloon soon after entering town.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons\nSection 1. It is hereby declared unlawful to carry in the hand or upon the person or otherwise any deadly weapon within the limits of said city of Tombstone, without first obtaining a permit in writing.\nSection 2: This prohibition does not extend to persons immediately leaving or entering the city, who, with good faith, and within reasonable time are proceeding to deposit, or take from the place of deposit such deadly weapon.\nSection 3: All fire-arms of every description, and bowie knives and dirks, are included within the prohibition of this ordinance.\u2014\u200a\nThe ordinance was the legal basis for City Marshal Virgil Earp's decision to confront the Cowboys on the day of the shootout.\nSmuggling and stock thefts.\nIn the borderlands south of Tombstone there was only one passable route between Arizona and Mexico, a passage known as Guadalupe Canyon. In August 1881, 15 Mexicans carrying gold, coins and bullion to make their purchases were ambushed and killed in Skeleton Canyon. The next month, Mexican Commandant Felipe Neri dispatched troops to the border, where they killed five Cowboys, including Newman Haynes \"Old Man\" Clanton, in Guadalupe Canyon.\nThe Earps knew that the McLaurys and Clantons were reputed to be mixed up in the robbery and murder in Skeleton Canyon. Wyatt Earp said in his testimony after the shootout, \"I naturally kept my eyes open and did not intend that any of the gang should get the drop on me if I could help it.\"\nEarp loses sheriff's office to Behan.\nOn July 27, 1880, Pima County Sheriff Charles A. Shibell, whose offices were in the county seat of Tucson, appointed Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff. On October 28, 1880, Tombstone Marshal Fred White attempted to disarm some late-night revelers who were shooting their pistols in the air. When he attempted to disarm Curly Bill Brocius, the gun discharged, striking White in the abdomen. Wyatt saw the shooting and pistol-whipped Brocius, knocking him unconscious, and arrested him. Wyatt later told his biographer John Flood that he thought Brocius was still armed at the time, and did not see Brocius' pistol on the ground.\nBrocius waived the preliminary hearing so he and his case could be immediately transferred to Tucson. Wyatt and a deputy took Brocius in a wagon the next day to Tucson to stand trial, possibly saving him from being lynched. Wyatt testified that he thought the shooting was accidental. It was also demonstrated that Brocius's pistol could be fired from half-cock. Fred White left a statement before he died two days later that the shooting was not intentional. Based on the evidence presented, Brocius was not charged with White's death.\nThe Tombstone council convened and appointed Virgil Earp as \"temporary assistant city marshal\" to replace White for a salary of $100 per month () until an election could be held on November 12. For the next few weeks, Virgil represented federal and local law enforcement and Wyatt represented Pima County.\nIn the November 2, 1880, election for Pima County sheriff, Democrat Shibell ran against Republican Bob Paul, who was expected to win. Votes arrived as late as November 7, and Shibell was unexpectedly re-elected. He immediately appointed Johnny Behan as the new deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County, a job that Wyatt wanted. A controversy ensued when Paul uncovered ballot-stuffing by Cowboys and he sued to overturn the election. While San Simeon precinct, east of Tombstone, only had 10 registered voters, Shibell won that precinct with 103 votes to 1. Ike Clanton was the election inspector and Johnny Ringo was one of the election judges.\nPaul finally became sheriff in April 1881, but it was too late to re-appoint Wyatt Earp as deputy sheriff because on February 1, 1881, the eastern portion of Pima County containing Tombstone had been split off into the new Cochise County, which would need its own sheriff, based in the county's largest city, Tombstone. This position was filled by a political appointment from the governor, and Wyatt and Behan both wanted the job. The Cochise County sheriff's position was worth more than $40,000 a year (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) because the office holder was also county assessor and tax collector, and the board of supervisors allowed him to keep ten percent of the amounts paid.\nBehan used his existing position and his superior political connections to successfully lobby for the position. He also promised Wyatt a position as his undersheriff if he was appointed over Wyatt. Wyatt withdrew from the political contest and the governor and legislature appointed Behan to the job of Cochise County sheriff on February 10, 1881. Behan reneged on his deal with Earp and appointed Harry Woods as undersheriff instead. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because Wyatt Earp used Behan's name to threaten Ike Clanton when Wyatt recovered his stolen horse from Clanton.\nEarp conflicts with Cowboys.\nTensions between the Earp family and both the Clanton and McLaury clans increased through 1881. On July 25, 1880, Captain Joseph H. Hurst, of Company A, 12th U.S. Infantry, and Commanding Officer of Fort Bennett, asked Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp to help him track Cowboys who had stolen six U.S. Army mules from Camp Rucker. This was a federal matter because the animals were U.S. property. Hurst brought four soldiers, and Virgil invited Wyatt and Morgan Earp, as well as Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. The posse found the mules on the McLaury's Ranch on Babacomari Creek, northwest of Tombstone, as well as the branding iron used to change the \"US\" brand to \"D8.\"\nTo avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst they would return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules, laughing at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He re-printed this in \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had asked him if he had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil. He warned Virgil, \"If you ever again follow us as close as you did, then you will have to fight anyway.\" This incident was the first run-in between the Clantons and McLaurys and the Earps.\nMarch stagecoach robbery and murder.\nOn the evening of March 15, 1881, a Kinnear &amp; Company stagecoach carrying $26,000 in silver bullion () was en route from Tombstone to Benson, Arizona, the nearest freight terminal. Bob Paul, who had run for Pima County Sheriff and was contesting the election he lost due to ballot-stuffing, was temporarily working once again as the Wells Fargo shotgun messenger. He had taken the reins and driver's seat in Contention City because the usual driver, a well-known and popular man named Eli \"Bud\" Philpot, was ill. Philpot was riding shotgun.\nNear Drew's Station, just outside Contention City, a man stepped into the road and commanded them to \"Hold!\" Three Cowboys attempted to rob the stage. Paul, in the driver's seat, fired his shotgun and emptied his revolver at the robbers, wounding a Cowboy later identified as Bill Leonard in the groin. Philpot, riding shotgun, and passenger Peter Roerig, riding in the rear dickey seat, were both shot and killed. The horses spooked and Paul was not able to bring the stage under control for almost , leaving the robbers with nothing. Paul, who normally rode shotgun, later said he thought the first shot killing Philpot had been meant for him.\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp, along with temporary federal deputies Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams, former Kansas Sheriff Bat Masterson (who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon), and County Sheriff Behan set out to find the robbers. Wells Fargo issued a wanted poster offering a $3,600 reward () for the three robbers ($1,200 each), dead or alive. Robbery of a mail-carrying stagecoach was both a federal crime and territorial crime, and the posse consisted of both county and federal authorities and deputies.\nThe posse trailed the robbers to a nearby ranch where they found a drifter named Luther King. He would not tell who his confederates were until the posse lied and told him that Doc Holliday's girlfriend had been shot. Fearful of Holliday's reputation, he confessed to holding the reins of the robbers' horses, and identified Bill Leonard, Harry \"The Kid\" Head, and Jim Crane as the robbers. They were all known Cowboys and rustlers. Behan and Williams escorted King back to Tombstone.\nRemarkably, King walked in the front door of the jail and a few minutes later walked out the back. King had arranged with Undersheriff Harry Woods (publisher of the \"Nugget\") to sell the horse he had been riding to John Dunbar, Sheriff Behan's partner in the Dexter Livery Stable. On March 19, King conveniently escaped while Dunbar and Woods were making out the bill-of-sale. Woods claimed that someone had deliberately unlocked a secured back door to the jail. The Earps and the townspeople were furious at King's easy escape. Williams was later dismissed from Wells Fargo, leaving behind a number of debts, when it was determined he had been stealing from the company for years.\nThe Earps pursued the other two men for 17 days, riding for 60 hours without food and 36 hours without water, during which Bob Paul's horse died, and Wyatt and Morgan's horses became so weak that the two men walked back to Tombstone to obtain new horses. After pursuing the Cowboys for over they could not obtain more fresh horses and were forced to give up the chase. They returned to Tombstone on April 1.\nBehan submitted a bill for $796.84, , to the county for posse expenses, but he refused to reimburse the Earps for any of their costs. Virgil was incensed. They were later reimbursed by Wells, Fargo &amp; Co., but the incident caused further friction between county and federal law enforcement, and between Behan and the Earps.\nAfter he was passed over by Johnny Behan for the position of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881, he offered the Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. reward money and more to Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects \u2014 Leonard, Head and Crane \u2014 were killed in unrelated incidents.\nIke began to fear that word of his possible cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, and said something to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.\nThe fallout over the Cowboys' attempt to implicate Holliday and the Earps in the robbery, along with Behan's involvement in King's escape, was the beginning of increasingly bad feelings between the Earp brothers and Cowboy factions.\nEarp and Behan attracted to Josephine Marcus.\nWyatt Earp and Cochise County sheriff Johnny Behan were interested in the same sheriff's position and also might have shared an interest in the same woman, Josephine Marcus, known as Sadie. Citizens of Tombstone believed that Behan and Sadie were married, but Behan was a known womanizer and had sex with prostitutes and other women. In early 1881, Sadie ended the relationship after she came home and found Behan in bed with the wife of a friend and kicked him out, although she used the Behan surname through the end of that summer. She rented her home sometime before April 1881 to Dr. George Goodfellow.\nWyatt Earp lived with Mattie Blaylock, who was listed as his wife in the 1880 census. She had a growing addiction to the opiate laudanum, which was readily available at the time. Earp remained with Blaylock until he left Tombstone in April 1882. There are no contemporary Tombstone records that indicate a relationship between Sadie and Earp, but Earp certainly knew her, because both Behan and Earp had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.\nSadie, traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left for Los Angeles on March 25, 1882, and then returned to her family in San Francisco. In July 1882, Wyatt left Colorado and went to San Francisco, where he sought out Sadie and his brother Virgil, who was seeking treatment for his arm. In February or March 1883, Sadie and Earp left San Francisco for Gunnison, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. Sadie was his common-law wife for the next 46 years.\nSeptember stage holdup.\nTensions between the Earps and the McLaurys further increased when another passenger stage on the 'Sandy Bob Line' in the Tombstone area, bound for Bisbee, was held up on September 8, 1881. The masked bandits robbed all of the passengers of their valuables since the stage was not carrying a strongbox. During the robbery, the driver heard one of the robbers describe the money as \"sugar\", a phrase known to be used by Frank Stilwell. Stilwell had, until the prior month, been a deputy for Sheriff Behan but had been fired for \"accounting irregularities\".\nWyatt and Virgil Earp rode with a sheriff's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been appointed Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. Virgil at the same time continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.\nStilwell and Spence arrests.\nFrank Stilwell had just arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the holdup. Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the preliminary hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence just as he had done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.\nReleased on bail, Spence and Stilwell were re-arrested October 13 by Marshal Virgil Earp for the Bisbee robbery on a new federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, reported that they had been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred on October 8 near Contention City.\nIke and other Cowboys believed the new arrest was further evidence that the Earps were illegally persecuting the Cowboys. They told the Earps that they could expect retaliation. While Virgil and Wyatt were in Tucson for the federal hearing on the charges against Spence and Stilwell, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp. He told him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again. \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" reported \"that since the arrest of Spence and Stilwell, veiled threats [are] being made that the friends of the accused will 'get the Earps.'\"\nCowboys accuse Holliday of robbery.\nMilt Joyce, a county supervisor and owner of the Oriental Saloon, had a contentious relationship with Doc Holliday. In October 1880, Holliday had trouble with a gambler named Johnny Tyler in Milt Joyce's Oriental Saloon. Tyler had been hired by a competing gambling establishment to drive customers from Joyce's saloon. Holliday challenged Tyler to a fight, but Tyler ran. Joyce did not like Holliday or the Earps and he continued to argue with Holliday.\nJoyce ordered Holliday removed from the saloon but would not return Holliday's revolver. But Holliday returned carrying a double-action revolver. Milt brandished a pistol and threatened Holliday, but Holliday shot Joyce in the palm, disarming him, and then shot Joyce's business partner William Parker in the big toe. Joyce then hit Holliday over the head with his revolver. Holliday was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault and battery.\nHolliday and his on-again, off-again mistress Big Nose Kate had many fights. After a particularly nasty, drunken argument, Holliday kicked her out. County Sheriff John Behan and Milt Joyce saw an opportunity and exploited the situation. They plied Big Nose Kate with more booze and suggested to her a way to get even with Holliday. She signed an affidavit implicating Holliday in the attempted stagecoach robbery and murders. Holliday was a good friend of Bill Leonard, a former watchmaker from New York, one of three men implicated in the robbery.\nJudge Wells Spicer issued an arrest warrant for Holliday. The Earps found witnesses who could attest to Holliday's location at the time of the murders and Kate sobered up, revealing that Behan and Joyce had influenced her to sign a document she did not understand. With the Cowboy plot revealed, Spicer freed Holliday. The district attorney threw out the charges, labeling them \"ridiculous.\" Doc gave Kate some money and put her on a stage out of town.\nIke Clanton's conflict with Doc Holliday.\nWyatt Earp testified after the gunfight that five or six weeks prior he had met Ike Clanton outside the Alhambra Hotel. Ike told Wyatt that Doc Holliday had told him he knew of Ike's meetings with Wyatt and about Ike providing information on Head, Leonard, and Crane, as well as their attempted robbery of the stage. Ike now accused Earp of telling Holliday about these conversations. Earp testified that he told Ike he had not told Holliday anything. Wyatt Earp offered to prove this when Holliday and the Clantons next returned to town.\nA month later, the weekend before the shootout, Morgan Earp was concerned about possible trouble with the Cowboys. He asked Doc Holliday to come back to Tombstone from a fiesta celebration in Tucson where Holliday had been gambling. Upon his return, Wyatt Earp asked Holliday about Ike's accusation.\nOn the morning of Tuesday, October 25, 1881, the day before the gunfight, Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury drove in a spring wagon from Chandler's Milk Ranch at the foot of the Dragoon Mountains to Tombstone. They were in town to sell a large number of beef stock, most of them owned by the McLaurys. Fred Dodge, an undercover detective for Wells Fargo, heard from J.B. Ayers, another undercover Wells Fargo man in Contention, that Frank McLaury, Billy Clanton, and Billy Claiborne were in town and planning to join Ike and Tom in Tombstone Wednesday afternoon. Dodge, who had been sick, got up and went looking for city marshal Virgil Earp. He found Tombstone Deputy City Marshal Morgan Earp at the Alhambra Saloon instead and told him the news.\nNear midnight, Holliday saw Clanton in the Alhambra Saloon and confronted him, accusing him of lying about their previous conversations. They got into a heated argument. Wyatt Earp, who was not wearing a badge, encouraged his brother Morgan to intervene. Morgan took Holliday out onto the street and Ike, who had been drinking steadily, followed them. City Marshal Virgil Earp arrived a few minutes later and threatened to arrest both Holliday and Clanton if they did not stop quarreling.\nWyatt Earp walked over to the Oriental Saloon and Ike followed him. They talked again, and Ike threatened to confront Holliday in the morning. Ike told Earp that the fighting talk had been going on for a long time and that he intended to put an end to it. Ike told Earp, \"I will be ready for you in the morning.\" Wyatt told Ike to go home \"because there was no money in it.\" Ike sat down near Wyatt, his revolver in plain sight, and told Earp \"You must not think I won't be after you all in the morning.\" Virgil Earp went to the Occidental Saloon across the street.\nMorning of the gunfight.\nEvents leading up to the Ike Clanton court hearing.\nAfter Holliday's confrontation with Ike Clanton, Wyatt Earp took Holliday back to his room at Camillus Sidney \"Buck\" Fly's Lodging House to sleep off his drinking, then went home and to bed. Tombstone Marshal Virgil Earp played poker with Ike Clanton, Tom McLaury, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan and a fifth unnamed man in a back room of the Occidental Saloon until morning.\nAt about dawn on October 26, the card game broke up and Behan and Virgil Earp went home to bed. Ike Clanton testified later he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton had no place to go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Ike Clanton in front of the telegraph office. Clanton had been drinking all night and Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Ike insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Ike was armed and covered his gun for him.\nBoyle later said that Ike told him, \"'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open \u2014 that they would have to fight' ...\u00a0I went down to Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when Wyatt, his brothers, and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open.\" Ike said in his testimony afterward that he remembered neither meeting Boyle nor making any such statements that day. Deputy Marshal Andy Bronk also heard the talk around town. He woke Virgil, who listened, and went back to sleep. Ike's continuous threats were not worth losing sleep over.\nLater in the morning, Ike picked up his rifle and revolver from the West End Corral, where he had deposited his weapons and stabled his wagon and team after entering town. By noon that day, Ike was still drinking and once again armed, in violation of the city ordinance against carrying firearms in the city. He told anyone who would listen he was looking for Holliday or an Earp. At Fly's boarding house where Holliday and his common-law wife Mary Katharine Horony were sleeping, proprietor Mary Fly heard Clanton's threats and banged on Holliday's door. Fly told Horony, \"Ike Clanton was here looking for [Holliday], and he had a rifle with him.\" Horony woke Holliday and relayed the threat, who replied, \"If God will let me live to get my clothes on, he will see me.\"\nAt about 1:00\u00a0p.m., Marshal Virgil and his Deputy Morgan Earp found Ike on Fourth Street, still armed, and Virgil pistol whipped him from behind. Disarming him, the Earps took Ike to appear before Justice of the Peace A.O. Wallace for violating the ordinance. Wyatt waited with Ike while Virgil went to find Justice Wallace so a court hearing could be held.\nIke Clanton court hearing.\nWhile Wyatt waited for Virgil to return with Justice Wallace, witnesses overheard Wyatt tell Ike, \"You cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, and you know that I know you are a cattle thieving son-of-a-bitch, you've threatened my life enough, and you've got to fight!\", Ike Clanton was heard to reply, \"Fight is my racket, and all I want is four feet of ground!\"\nIke reported in his testimony afterward that Wyatt Earp cursed him. He said Wyatt, Virgil and Morgan offered him his rifle and to fight him right there in the courthouse, which Ike declined. Ike also denied ever threatening the Earps. Justice Wallace fined Ike $25 () plus court costs. Ike paid the fine and Virgil told Ike he could pick up his confiscated rifle and revolver at the Grand Hotel, which was favored by Cowboys when in town. Ike testified that he picked up the weapons from William Soule, the jailer, a couple of days later.\nTom McLaury's concealed weapon.\nOutside the court house where Ike was being fined, Tombstone Deputy Marshal Wyatt almost walked into 28-year-old Tom McLaury as the two men were brought up short nose-to-nose. Tom, who had arrived in town the day before, was required by the well-known city ordinance to deposit his pistol when he first arrived in town. When Wyatt demanded, \"Are you heeled or not?\", McLaury said he was not armed. Wyatt testified that he saw a revolver in plain sight on the right hip of Tom's pants.\nAs an unpaid deputy marshal for Virgil, Wyatt habitually carried a pistol, in his waistband or in a coat pocket lined with leather to make drawing it easier. Witnesses reported that Wyatt drew his revolver from his coat pocket and pistol whipped Tom McLaury with it twice, leaving him prostrate and bleeding on the street. Saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan testified at the Spicer hearing afterward that he saw McLaury deposit a revolver at the Capital Saloon sometime between 1:00\u20132:00\u00a0p.m., after the confrontation with Wyatt, which Mehan also witnessed.\nWyatt said in his deposition afterward that he had been temporarily acting as city marshal for Virgil the week before while Virgil was in Tucson for the Pete Spence and Frank Stilwell trial. Wyatt said that he still considered himself a deputy city marshal, which Virgil later confirmed. Since Wyatt was an off-duty officer, he could not legally search or arrest Tom for carrying a revolver within the city limits \u2014 a misdemeanor offense. Only Virgil or one of his city police deputies, including Morgan Earp and possibly Warren Earp, could search him and take any required action. Wyatt, who was portrayed as a non-drinker, testified at the Spicer hearing that he went to Haffords and bought a cigar and went outside to watch the Cowboys. At the time of the gunfight about two hours later, Wyatt could not know if Tom was still armed.\nIt was early afternoon by the time Ike and Tom had seen doctors for their head wounds. The day was chilly, with snow still on the ground in some places. Both Tom and Ike had spent the night gambling, drinking heavily, and without sleep. Now they were both out-of-doors, both wounded from head beatings, and at least Ike was still drunk.\nMore Cowboys enter town.\nAt around 1:30\u20132:00\u00a0p.m., after Tom had been pistol-whipped by Wyatt, Ike's 19-year-old younger brother Billy Clanton and Tom's older brother Frank McLaury arrived in town. They had heard from their neighbor, Ed \"Old Man\" Frink, that Ike had been stirring up trouble in town overnight, and they had ridden into town on horseback to back up their brothers.\nThey arrived from Antelope Springs, east of Tombstone, where they had been rounding up stock and had breakfasted with Ike and Tom the day before. Both Frank and Billy were armed with a revolver and a rifle, as was the custom for riders in the country outside Tombstone. Apache warriors had engaged the U.S. Army near Tombstone just three weeks before the O.K. Corral gunfight, so the need for weapons outside of town was well established and accepted.\nBilly and Frank stopped first at the Grand Hotel on Allen Street, and were greeted by Doc Holliday. They learned immediately about their brothers' beatings by the Earps within the previous two hours. The incidents had generated a lot of talk in town. Angrily, Frank said he would not drink, and he and Billy left the saloon immediately to seek Tom. By law, both Frank and Billy should have left their firearms at the Grand Hotel. Instead, they remained fully armed.\nVirgil and Wyatt Earp's reactions.\nWyatt said that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberg's gun and hardware store on 4th Street filling their gun belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there and that he had tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike, apparently, had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberg's shop.\nWhen Virgil Earp learned that Wyatt was talking to the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop, he went there himself. Virgil testified afterward that he thought he saw all four men, Ike Clanton, Billy Clanton, Frank McLaury, and Tom McLaury, buying cartridges. Virgil went around the corner on Allen Street to the Wells Fargo office, where he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun. It was an unusually cold and windy day in Tombstone, and Virgil was wearing a long overcoat. To avoid alarming Tombstone's public, Virgil hid the shotgun under his overcoat when he returned to Hafford's Saloon.\nFrom Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. For unknown reasons the Cowboys then walked out the back of the O.K. Corral and then west, stopping in a narrow, empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house.\nVirgil initially avoided a confrontation with the newly arrived Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton, who had not yet deposited their weapons at a hotel or stable as the law required. The statute was not specific about how far a recently arrived visitor might \"with good faith, and within reasonable time\" travel into town while carrying a firearm. This permitted a traveler to keep his firearms if he was proceeding directly to a livery, hotel or saloon. The three main Tombstone corrals were all west of 4th Street between Allen and Fremont, a block or two from where Wyatt saw the Cowboys buying cartridges. Miner Ruben F. Coleman later told \"The Tombstone Epitaph\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was in the O.K. Corral at 2:30 p.m. when I saw the two Clantons and the two McLaurys in an earnest conversation across the street at Dunbar's corral. I went up the street and notified Sheriff Behan and told them it was my opinion that they meant trouble, and it was his duty, as sheriff, to go and disarm them. I told him they had gone to the West End Corral. I then went and saw Marshal Virgil Earp and notified him to the same effect.\nBehan attempts to disarm Cowboys.\nCochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, a friend of the Cowboys, later testified that he woke up about 1:30\u00a0p.m. after the late-night card game he went to get a shave at a barbershop. That is where he first learned that the Cowboys were armed. Behan stated he quickly finished his shave and went to locate the Cowboys. At about 2:30\u00a0p.m. he found Frank McLaury holding a horse and talking to someone on 4th Street near the corner of Fremont. When he saw Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury near C. S. Fly's photography studio, he walked there with Frank. He told the Cowboys that they must give up their arms. Ike Clanton said he was not armed, and Tom McLaury pulled his coat open to show he was not carrying a weapon.\nThe Cowboys were located in a narrow lot between the Harwood house and Fly's 12-room boarding house and photography studio at 312 Fremont Street, where Doc Holliday roomed.\nBehan later said he attempted to persuade Frank McLaury to give up his weapons, but Frank insisted that he would give up his guns only after City Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers were first disarmed.\nThe Cowboys were about a block and a half from the West End Corral at 2nd. Street and Fremont, where Ike and Tom's wagon and team were stabled. Virgil Earp later testified that he thought Ike and Tom were stabled at the O.K. Corral on Allen between 3rd and 4th, from which he thought they would be departing if they were leaving town.\nWhile Ike Clanton later said he was planning to leave town, Frank McLaury reported that he had decided to remain behind to take care of some business. Will McLaury, Tom and Frank's brother and a judge in Fort Worth, Texas, claimed in a letter he wrote during the preliminary hearing after the shootout that Tom and Frank were still armed because they were planning to conduct business before leaving town to visit him in Texas. He wrote that Billy Clanton, who had arrived on horseback with Frank, intended to go with the McLaurys to Fort Worth.\nWill McLaury came to Tombstone after the gun fight and joined the prosecution team in an attempt to convict the Earps and Holliday for his brothers' murder. Paul Johnson told a different story, that the McLaurys were about to leave for Iowa to attend the wedding of their sister, Sarah Caroline. Tom and Frank were especially close to Sarah, one of their 14 siblings and half-siblings. Caroline married James Reed in Richland, Iowa at the end of November that year.\nVirgil decides to disarm Cowboys.\nCitizens reported to Virgil on the Cowboys' movements and their threats told him that Ike and Tom had left their livery stable and entered town while armed, in violation of the city ordinance. Virgil Earp was told by several citizens that the McLaurys and the Clantons had gathered on Fremont Street. Virgil decided he had to disarm the Cowboys. His decision to take action may have been influenced by the Cowboys' repeated threats to the Earps, their proximity to Holliday's room in Fly's boarding house, and their location on the route the Earps usually took to their homes two blocks further west on Fremont Street.\nSeveral members of the citizen's vigilance committee offered to support him with arms, but Virgil refused. He had, during the prior month, appointed Morgan as a Special Policeman. He had also appointed Wyatt as a Special Policeman while Virgil had been in Prescott on business. He had also called on Doc Holliday that morning for help with disarming the Clantons and McLaurys. Wyatt spoke of his brothers Virgil and Morgan as the \"marshals\" while he acted as \"deputy.\"\nVirgil Earp picked up the shotgun he had retrieved from the Wells Fargo office earlier. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's walking-stick in return.\nAs usual, the Earps carried their revolvers in their coat pockets or in their waistbands. Wyatt Earp was carrying a .44 caliber American 1869 Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. Holliday was carrying a nickel-plated pistol in a holster, concealed by his long coat, as was the shotgun. The Earps and Holliday walked west, down the south side of Fremont Street past the rear entrance to the O.K. Corral, but out of visual range of the Cowboys' last reported location.\nNear the corner of Fourth St. and Fremont St., the Earps ran into Sheriff Behan. He had left the Cowboys and came toward the Earps, though he looked nervously backward several times. Virgil testified afterward that Behan told them, \"For God's sake, don't go down there or they will murder you!\" Wyatt said Behan told him and Morgan, \"I have disarmed them.\" Behan testified afterward that he had only said he had gone down to the Cowboys \"for the purpose of disarming them,\" not that he had actually disarmed them. One eyewitness, laundryman Peter H. Fallehy, testified afterward that Virgil Earp told Behan, \"those men have made their threats and I will not arrest them but I will kill them on sight.\"\nWhen Behan said he had disarmed them, Virgil attempted to avoid a fight. \"I had a walking stick in my left hand and my hand was on my six-shooter in my waist pants, and when he said he had disarmed them, I shoved it clean around to my left hip and changed my walking stick to my right hand.\" Wyatt said, \"I took my pistol, which I had in my hand, under my coat, and put it in my overcoat pocket.\" The Earps walked further down Fremont street and came into full view of the Cowboys in the lot.\nWyatt testified he saw \"Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton standing in a row against the east side of the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of Fly's photograph gallery. Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know [Wes Fuller] were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west.\" Addie Bourland corroborated Wyatt's testimony, stating that she saw \"five men opposite my house, leaning against a small house west of Fly's Gallery and one man was holding a horse, standing a little out from the house.\"\nThe gunfight.\nMartha J. King was in Bauer's butcher shop located on Fremont Street. She testified that when the Earp party passed by her location, one of the Earps on the outside of the group looked across and said to Doc Holliday nearest the store, \"... let them have it!\" to which Holliday replied, \"All right.\"\nPhysical proximity.\nWhen the Earps approached the lot, the four lawmen initially faced six Cowboys: Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, Billy Clanton, Billy Claiborne, Wes Fuller, and Ike Clanton. When the Cowboys saw the officers, they stepped away from the Harwood house.\nIn testimony given by witnesses afterward, they disagreed about the precise location of the men before, during and after the gunfight. The coroner's inquest and the Spicer hearing produced a sketch showing the Cowboys standing, from left to right facing Fremont Street, with Billy Clanton and then Frank McLaury near the Harwood house and Tom McLaury and Ike Clanton roughly in the middle of the lot.\nOpposite them and initially only about away, Virgil Earp was on the left end of the Earp party, standing a few feet inside the vacant lot and nearest Ike Clanton. Behind him a few feet near the corner of C. S. Fly's boarding house was Wyatt. Morgan Earp was standing on Fremont Street to Wyatt's right, and Doc Holliday anchored the end of their line in Fremont Street, a few feet to Morgan's right.\nWyatt Earp drew a sketch in 1924 and another with John Flood on September 15, 1926, that depicted Billy Clanton near the middle of the lot, close to the Harwood house. Tom and Frank McLaury stood deeper in the lot. Frank was in the center between the two buildings, holding the reins of his horse. Tom was closer to C. S. Fly's boarding house. According to Wyatt's sketches, Morgan was on the right of the lawmen, close to the Harwood house, opposite Billy Clanton near the Harwood house and close to Fremont St. Virgil was deeper in the lot, opposite Frank and Ike Clanton. Wyatt was to Virgil's left, opposite Tom. Doc Holliday hung back a step or two on Fremont Street. Neither of Wyatt's sketches included Ike Clanton or Billy Claiborne, who ran from the fight.\nGun battle begins.\nVirgil Earp was not expecting a fight. After Behan said that he had disarmed the Cowboys, Virgil and Wyatt put the pistols they had been holding in their waistband or overcoat pocket. Holliday had a short coach gun concealed under his long jacket.\nBilly Clanton and Frank McLaury wore revolvers in holsters on their belts and stood alongside their saddled horses with rifles in their scabbards conversing with a unknown man, purported to be Calico Jones, possibly in violation of the city ordinance prohibiting carrying weapons in town.\nWhen Virgil saw the Cowboys, he testified, he immediately commanded the Cowboys to \"Throw up your hands, I want your guns!\" Wyatt said Virgil told the Cowboys, \"Throw up your hands; I have come to disarm you!\" Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their single action six shot revolvers as Calico Jones escaped down an adjacent alley back towards The O.K. Corral. Virgil yelled: \"Hold! I don't mean that!\" or \"Hold on, I don't want that!\"\nJeff Morey, who served as the historical consultant on the film \"Tombstone\", compared testimony by partisan and neutral witnesses and came to the conclusion that the Earps described the situation accurately.\nWho started shooting first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The smoke from the black powder used in the weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories, and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first. The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.\nVirgil Earp reported afterward, \"Two shots went off right together. Billy Clanton's was one of them.\" Wyatt testified, \"Billy Clanton leveled his pistol at me, but I did not aim at him. I knew that Frank McLaury had the reputation of being a good shot and a dangerous man, and I aimed at Frank McLaury.\" He said he shot Frank McLaury after both he and Billy Clanton went for their revolvers: \"The first two shots were fired by Billy Clanton and myself, he shooting at me, and I shooting at Frank McLaury.\" Morey agreed that Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp fired first. Clanton missed, but Earp shot Frank McLaury in the stomach.\nAll witnesses generally agreed that the first two shots were almost indistinguishable from each other. General firing immediately broke out. Virgil and Wyatt thought Tom was armed. When the shooting started, the horse that Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw his hand to his right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.\nAccording to one witness, Holliday drew a \"large bronze pistol\" (interpreted by some as Virgil's coach gun) from under his long coat, stepped around Tom McLaury's horse, and shot him with the double-barreled shotgun in the chest at close range.\nWitness C. H. \"Ham\" Light saw Tom running or stumbling westward on Fremont Street towards Third Street, away from the gunfight, while Frank and Billy were still standing and shooting. Light testified that Tom fell at the foot of a telegraph pole on the corner of Fremont and 3rd Street and lay there, without moving, through the duration of the fight. Fallehy also saw Tom stagger across the street until he fell on his back. After shooting Tom, Holliday tossed the empty shotgun aside, pulled out his nickel-plated revolver, and continued to fire at Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton.\nIke Clanton had been publicly threatening to kill the Earps for several months, including very loud threats on the day before. Wyatt told the court afterward that Clanton had bragged that he would kill the Earps or Doc Holliday at his first opportunity. However, when the gunfight broke out, Clanton ran forward and grabbed Wyatt, exclaiming that he was unarmed and did not want a fight. To this protest Wyatt said he responded, \"Go to fighting or get away!\"\nClanton ran through the front door of Fly's boarding house and escaped, unwounded. Other accounts say that Ike drew a hidden pistol and fired at the Earps before disappearing. Like Ike, Billy Claiborne was unarmed. He and Cowboy Wes Fuller, who had been at the rear of the lot, also ran from the fight as soon as the shooting began.\nAccording to \"The Tombstone Epitaph\", \"Wyatt Earp stood up and fired in rapid succession, as cool as a cucumber, and was not hit.\" Morgan Earp fired almost immediately, as Billy Clanton drew his gun right-handed. Morgan's shot hit Billy in the right wrist, disabling his hand. Forced to shift the revolver to his left hand, Clanton continued shooting until he emptied the gun. Virgil and Wyatt were now firing. Morgan Earp tripped and fell over a newly buried waterline and fired from the ground.\nWyatt shot Frank McLaury in the abdomen, and Frank took his horse by its reins and struggled across Fremont Street. He tried and failed to grab his rifle from the scabbard but lost control of the horse. Frank crossed Fremont Street firing his revolver instead. Frank and Holliday exchanged shots as Frank moved across Fremont Street, and Frank hit Holliday in his pistol pocket, grazing him. Holliday followed him, exclaiming, \"That son of a bitch has shot me and I am going to kill him.\" Morgan Earp picked himself up and also fired at Frank. Frank fell to the sidewalk on the east side of Fremont Street.\nA number of witnesses observed a man leading a horse into the street and firing near it and Wyatt in his testimony thought this was Tom McLaury. Claiborne said only one man had a horse in the fight, and that this man was Frank, holding his own horse by the reins, then losing it and its cover, in the middle of the street. Wes Fuller also identified Frank as the man in the street leading the horse.\nThough wounded, Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury kept shooting. One of them, perhaps Billy, shot Morgan Earp across the back in a wound that struck both shoulder blades and a vertebra. Morgan went down for a minute before picking himself up. Either Frank or Billy shot Virgil Earp in the calf (Virgil thought it was Billy). Virgil, though hit, fired his next shot at Billy Clanton.\nFrank, now entirely across Fremont street and still walking at a good pace according to Claiborne's testimony, fired twice more before he was shot in the head under his right ear. Both Morgan and Holliday apparently thought they had fired the shot that killed Frank, but since neither of them testified at the hearing, this information is only from second-hand accounts. A passerby testified to having stopped to help Frank, and saw Frank try to speak, but he died where he fell, before he could be moved.\nBilly Clanton was shot in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting position near his original position at the corner of the Harwood house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out of ammunition, he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.\nA few moments later, Tom McLaury was carried from the corner of Fremont and Third into the Harwood house on that corner, where he died without speaking. Passersby carried Billy Clanton to the Harwood house, where Tom had been taken. Billy was in considerable pain and asked for a doctor and some morphine. He told those near him, \"They have murdered me. I have been murdered. Chase the crowd away and from the door and give me air.\" Billy gasped for air, and someone else heard him say, \"Go away and let me die.\" Ike Clanton, who had repeatedly threatened the Earps with death, was still running. William Cuddy testified that Ike passed him on Allen Street and Johnny Behan saw him a few minutes later on Toughnut Street.\nOutcome of the battle.\nBoth Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was shot through the calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.\nBehan attempts arrest.\nAs the wounded lawmen were carried to their homes, they passed in front of the Sheriff's Office, and Johnny Behan told Wyatt Earp, \"I will have to arrest you.\" Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly: \"I won't be arrested today. I am right here and am not going away. You have deceived me. You told me these men were disarmed; I went to disarm them.\" Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps' wounds.\nCowboy wounds.\nDr. Henry M. Mathews examined the dead Cowboys late that night. He found Frank McLaury had two wounds: a gunshot beneath the right ear that horizontally penetrated his head, and a second entering his abdomen to the left of his navel. Mathews stated that the wound beneath the ear was at the base of the brain and caused instant death. Sheriff Behan testified that he had heard Morgan Earp yell \"I got him\" after Frank was shot. However, during the gunfight, Frank moved across Fremont street, putting Holliday on Frank's right and Morgan on his left. This makes it much more likely that Holliday shot the fatal round that killed Frank.\nWhen he examined Tom McLaury's body, Mathews found twelve buckshot wounds from a single shotgun blast on the right side under his arm, between the third and fifth ribs. The wound was about across. The nature and location of the wound indicated that it could not have been received if Tom's hands were on his coat lapels as the Cowboys later testified. Both Virgil and Wyatt stated that Holliday had shot Tom, which the coroner's exam supported.\nDr. George Goodfellow testified about Billy Clanton's wounds at the Spicer hearing. He stated that the angle of the wrist wound indicated that Billy's hand could not have been raised over his head as claimed by Cowboy witnesses. In his coroner's report, Mathews did not mention Billy's arm wound, but witness Keefe, who examined the arm closely, testified later that Clanton was shot through the right arm, close to the wrist joint and the bullet passed through the arm from \"inside to outside,\" entering the arm close to the base of the thumb, and exiting \"on the back of the wrist diagonally\" with the latter wound larger. This indicated to the judge that Billy could not have been holding his coat's lapels open, his arms raised, as the Cowboys testified.\nDr. Mathews found two other wounds on Billy's body. The first was from Clanton's left nipple, and penetrated his lung. The other was in the abdomen beneath the twelfth rib, to the right of the navel. Both were fired from the front. Neither passed completely through his body. The wound to Billy Clanton's right wrist may have been inflicted by Morgan Earp or Doc Holliday immediately at the outset of the fight as Billy was drawing his gun.\nWeapons carried by the Cowboys.\nBilly Clanton was armed with a Colt Frontier Six-Shooter revolver in .44-40 caliber, which was identified by its serial number at the Spicer hearing. C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton's empty revolver in his hand where he lay and took it from him.\nFrank McLaury was also armed with a Colt Frontier Six-Shooter in .44-40 caliber, which was recovered by laundryman Fallehy on the street about from his body with two rounds remaining in it. Fallehy placed it next to Frank's body before he was moved to the Harwood house. Dr. Mathews laid Frank's revolver on the floor while he examined Billy and Tom. Cowboy witness Wes Fuller said he saw Frank in the middle of the street shooting a revolver and trying to remove a Winchester Rifle from the scabbard on his horse. The two Model 1873 rifles were still in the scabbards on Frank and Tom McLaury's horses when they were found after the gunfight. If, as was customary, Frank carried only five rounds in his revolver, then he had fired only three shots.\nWitnesses differed about whether Tom McLaury was carrying a weapon during the shootout or not. No revolver or rifle was found near his body and he was not wearing a cartridge belt. Wyatt testified that he had arrested Tom earlier that day when he found him carrying a weapon earlier in violation of a city ordinance. He pistol-whipped him and took him to the courthouse where he was fined. Saloon-keeper Mehan testified that Tom had deposited his revolver at the Capital Saloon on 4th Street and Fremont after his arrest and before the fight, between 1 and 2 p.m. Several Cowboy witnesses testified that Tom was unarmed and claimed that the Earps had murdered a defenseless man.\nBehan testified that when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom might have had a pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's testimony was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor for a loan to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.\nA story by Richard Rule in the Cowboy-friendly newspaper, the \"Nugget\", told the story in the manner of the day, without attribution. Rule wrote, \"The Sheriff stepped out and said [to the Earps]: 'Hold up boys, don't go down there or there will be trouble; I have been down there to disarm them.'\" In his testimony, Behan repeatedly insisted he told the Earps that he only intended to disarm the Cowboys, not that he had actually done so. The article said that Behan \"was standing near by commanding the contestants to cease firing but was powerless to prevent it.\"\nThe \"Nugget\" had a close relationship to Behan. It was owned by Harry Woods, who was also undersheriff to Behan, but Woods was collecting prisoners in El Paso, Texas, that day. So it is extremely likely that Rule interviewed Behan. Both Virgil and Williams' testified that Behan visited Virgil Earp that evening and said, \"I am your friend, and you did perfectly right.\" This corroborated the initial \"Nugget\" report, which upon Wood's return was altered to a version that favored the Cowboys and which Behan later supported in his testimony at the hearing.\nThough saloon-keeper Andrew Mehan had seen Tom deposit his pistol after his beating by Earp and before the gunfight, none of the Earps had any way of knowing that Tom had left his revolver at the saloon. Hotel keeper Albert \"Chris\" Billickie, whose father Charles owned the Cosmopolitan Hotel, saw Tom McLaury enter Bauer's butcher shop about 2:00\u00a0p.m. He testified that Tom's right-hand pants pocket was flat when he went in but protruded, as if it contained a pistol (so he thought), when he emerged. Retired army surgeon Dr. J. W. Gardiner also testified that he saw the bulge in Tom's pants. However, the bulge in Tom's pants pocket may have been the nearly $3,300 () in cash and receipts found on his body, perhaps in payment for stolen Mexican beef purchased by the butcher.\nWyatt and Virgil Earp and Doc Holliday believed that Tom had a revolver at the time of the gunfight. Wyatt thought Tom fired a revolver under the horse's neck and believed until he died that Tom's revolver had been removed from the scene by Wesley Fuller. Witness Fallehy wrote that he saw Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday shooting at a man who was using a horse to barricade himself, and once shot the man fell. In his statement, Fallehy wrote that the man still held his pistol in his hand. Although he did not see him shoot, he thought Tom McLaury was armed.\nRuben F. Coleman also said afterward that he thought Tom was armed, though he later equivocated on this point. He was quoted in the October 27 issue of \"The Tombstone Epitaph\" in which he said, \"Tom McLaury fell first, but raised and fired again before he died.\" Coleman also testified at the coroner's inquest one day later. Part-time newspaper reporter Howell 'Pat' Hayhurst transcribed all of the testimony from the hearing in the early 1930s as part of the Federal Writers' Project, in the Works Progress Administration.\nWhen he transcribed Coleman's second testimony, he quoted Coleman as saying, \"Tom McLaury, after the first two shots were fired, ran down Fremont Street and fell ... I think that the report I gave to the \"Epitaph\" was pretty near correct as published.\" However, it is known that Hayhurst arbitrarily removed text that he decided was not relevant. Author Stuart N. Lake later said Hayhurst 'mutilated' the transcription. The documents were subsequently lost and are still unaccounted for.\nEven if Tom was not armed with a revolver, Virgil Earp testified Tom attempted to grab a rifle from the scabbard on the horse in front of him before he was killed. Judge Spicer ruled afterward that \"if Thomas McLaury was one of a party who were thus armed and were making felonious resistance to an arrest, and in the melee that followed was shot, the fact of his being unarmed, if it be a fact, could not of itself criminate the defendants [Earps], if they were not otherwise criminated.\"\nIke Clanton and Billy Claiborne both said they were unarmed when they fled the gunfight.\nPublic reaction.\nThe bodies of the three dead Cowboys were displayed in a window at Ritter and Reams undertakers with a sign: \"Murdered in the Streets of Tombstone.\"\nSympathy for Cowboys.\nThe funerals for Billy Clanton (age 19), Tom McLaury (age 28) and his older brother Frank (age 33) were well attended. About 300 people joined in the procession to Boot Hill and as many as two thousand watched from the sidewalks. Both McLaurys were buried in the same grave, and Billy Clanton was buried nearby. The story was widely printed in newspapers across the United States. Most versions favored the lawmen. The headline in the \"San Francisco Exchange\" was, \"A Good Riddance\".\nThree days after the shootout, the ruling of the Coroner's Jury convened by Dr. Henry Matthews neither condemned nor exonerated the lawmen for shooting the Cowboys. \"William Clanton, Frank and Thomas McLaury, came to their deaths in the town of Tombstone on October 26, 1881, from the effects of pistol and gunshot wounds inflicted by Virgil Earp, Morgan Earp, Wyatt Earp, and one\u2014Holliday, commonly called 'Doc Holliday'.\"\nSpicer hearings.\nFour days after the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still recovering at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail (), which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending the outcome of the trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was enough evidence to go to trial.\nThe prosecution was led by Republican District Attorney Lyttleton Price, assisted by John M. Murphy, James Robinson, and Ben Goodrich. They were joined by William McLaury, Frank and Tom's older brother, he also being an able attorney, who played a key role on the prosecutor's team. The Earps' attorney Thomas Fitch was an experienced trial lawyer and had earned a reputation as the \"silver-tongued orator of the Pacific.\"\nSpicer took written and oral testimony from a number of witnesses over more than a month. Accounts by both participants and eye-witnesses were contradictory. Those loyal to one side or the other told conflicting stories and independent eyewitnesses who did not know the participants by sight were unable to say for certain who shot first.\nCochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan testified on the third day of the hearing. During two days on the stand, he gave strong testimony that the Cowboys had not resisted but either threw up their hands and turned out their coats to show they were not armed. Behan's views turned public opinion against the Earps, who were free on bail. He and other prosecution witnesses testified that Tom McLaury was unarmed, that Billy Clanton had his hands in the air, and that neither of the McLaurys were troublemakers. They portrayed Ike Clanton and Tom McLaury as being unjustly bullied and beaten by the vengeful Earps on the day of the gunfight. On the strength of the prosecution case, Spicer revoked the bail for Doc and Wyatt Earp and had them jailed on November 7. They spent the next 16 days in jail.\nDefense accounts contradicted the testimony of Behan, Claiborne and Allen, who all said that a man had fired a nickel-plated pistol first. Claiborne and Allen both said it was Holliday. Virgil, Wyatt and other witnesses testified that Holliday was carrying a shotgun. (Morgan remained bedridden throughout the trial and did not testify.) The prosecution's scenario would have required Holliday to fire with his pistol first, switch to the shotgun to shoot Tom McLaury, then switch back again to his pistol to continue firing.\nThree witnesses gave key evidence that swayed Justice Spicer to hold that Virgil had acted within his capacity as town marshal and that there was insufficient evidence to indict the Earps and Doc Holliday for murder.\nH.F Sills was an AT&amp;SF RR engineer who had just arrived in town and knew none of the parties involved. He testified that he saw \"the marshal go up and speak to this other party. I ... saw them pull out their revolvers immediately. The marshal had a cane in his right hand at the time. He throwed up his hand and spoke. I did not hear the words though. By that time Billy Clanton and Wyatt Earp had fired their guns off.\" Grilled by the prosecution, he corroborated virtually all of the defense's testimony.\nAddie Bourland was a dressmaker whose residence was across Fremont Street from Fly's Boarding House. She testified that she saw both sides facing each other, that none of the Cowboys had held their hands up, that the firing was general, and that she had not seen Billy Clanton fall immediately as the Cowboys had testified.\nJudge J.H. Lucas of the Cochise County Probate Court had offices in the Mining Exchange Building about from the shootout. Lucas corroborated Addie Bourland's testimony that Billy Clanton was standing throughout the fight, which contradicted prosecution witnesses who maintained he went down immediately after being shot at close range in the belly. Spicer noted that no powder burns were found on his clothing.\nThese witnesses' testimony, especially that of H.F. Sills, a disinterested party, discredited much of the testimony given by Sheriff Johnny Behan, Ike Clanton and the other Cowboy witnesses.\nAfter hearing all the evidence, Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that Virgil, as the lawman in charge that day, had acted within his office and that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a \"proposition both monstrous and startling!\" He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys' purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them.\nSpicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their hands and arms had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps' actions and criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp.\nIn popular culture.\nThe public perception of the Earp brothers' actions at the time were widely divergent. Even today, the event and its participants are viewed differently by opinionated admirers and detractors. The controversy still stimulates ongoing interest in the gunfight and related events.\nGunfight sketch.\nA hand-drawn sketch of the gunfight was made by John Flood with Wyatt Earp's assistance on September 15, 1921; it was sold at auction in October 2010 for $380,000. The map describes the position of a number of witnesses and all of the participants with the exception of Ike Clanton, who fled from the gunfight.\nPaintings.\nIn 1952, Victor Clyde Forsythe, a popular painter of desert scenes and cowboy artist, painted \"Gunfight at O.K. Corral\", a oil painting. Forsythe's father William Bowen Forsyth and uncle Ira Chandler owned the store Chandler &amp; Forsyth C.O.D. at 328 Fremont Street, west of the back entrance to the O.K. Corral and half a block from the site of the gunfight. They claimed that they had been present and witnessed the shootout. Newspaper accounts of the painting reported that Forsythe had interviewed Tombstone residents and examined many of the existing buildings before beginning to plan his painting. In May 1988, his studio printed and sold a limited edition of 390 copies of the painting.\nJohn Gilchriese became friends with John Flood, who had been Wyatt Earp's secretary, confidante, and best friend for many years. When Earp died, Flood inherited many of his personal belongings. Flood in turn willed them to Gilchriese, who amassed over a number of years one of the largest collections of personal items belonging to Wyatt and Virgil Earp, along with many unpublished photos of them and their family. Gilchriese opened the Wyatt Earp Museum in Tombstone in 1966 and commissioned Western artist Don Perceval to paint the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.\nThe oil on masonite painting titled \"The Street Fight\" is . It was the largest work ever executed by Perceval. He referred to original documents in Gilchriese's collection, including Wyatt Earp's own diagram of the shootout, and unpublished notes made by John Flood, to create what is regarded as the most accurate depiction of the shootout. Gilchreise had 500 lithographic prints reproduced from the original, which Perceval signed. The prints were sold by the museum for $10 ().\nAfter Gilchriese closed his museum, the painting and other contents of the museum were sold at auction by John's Western Gallery of San Francisco. The estimated auction price for the painting had been $200,000 to $300,000; the final sale price on June 25, 2004, was $40,250. It was put up for auction again on June 14, 2014, with an estimated selling price of $40,000\u2013$60,000 but failed to sell.\nOrigin of the gunfight's name.\nLess than a month after the shootout it was described by a local newspaper as the \"Gunfight at The O.K. Corral\". William Breakenridge in his 1928 book \"Helldorado: Bringing Law to the Mesquite\" described it as \"The Incident Near the O.K. Corral\". Stuart Lake titled his chapter about the conflict \"At the O.K. Corral\" in his popular book \"\". But it was the popular movie \"Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" that cemented the incident and its erroneous location in popular consciousness. The movie and accompanying mythologizing also altered the way that the public thought of the Earps and the outlaws. Prior to the movie, the media often criticized the Earps' actions in Tombstone. In the movies, they became the good guys, always ready to stand for what is right.\nThe incident has become a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and the symbolism of the fight between lawmen and the Cowboys. The Cowboys maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention. The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased to exist, as a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.\nThe town of Tombstone has capitalized on interest in the gunfight. A portion of the town is a historical district that has been designated a National Historic Landmark and is listed in the \"National Register of Historic Places\" by the U.S. National Park Service. A local company produces daily theatrical re-enactments of the gunfight.\nFilm and television.\nWith the widespread sales of televisions after World War II, producers spun out a large number of western-oriented shows. At the height of their popularity in 1959, there were more than two dozen \"cowboy\" programs on each week. At least six of them were directly or indirectly connected with Wyatt Earp: \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\", \"Bat Masterson\", \"Tombstone Territory\", \"Broken Arrow\", \"Johnny Ringo\", and \"Gunsmoke\". Hugh O'Brian portrayed Earp on the namesake show \"Wyatt Earp\" which ran for six seasons, and he was forever associated with that role.\nA 2003 episode of Discovery Channel's \"Unsolved History\" used modern technology to attempt to re-enact the gunfight. They utilized a movie set to recreate a space similar to the lot where the original gun fight took place. They confirmed that the front-to-back wrist wound suffered by Billy Clanton could only have occurred if his arm was raised in the manner of one holding a pistol, and that the black powder may have obscured the shooters' view of each other. The episode concluded that the three eyewitnesses for the prosecution (Sheriff Behan, Ike Clanton, and Billy Claiborne) likely offered perjured testimony. They found that Tom McLaury may have been hit by the shotgun round under his armpit as he reached over his horse for a rifle in his scabbard, as the horse turned away from him at the same time.\nThe stories about the gunfight written in the 20th century affected American culture. Numerous dramatic, fictional, and documentary works have been produced about or in reference to the event, with widely varying degrees of accuracy. These works include:\nIn mathematics.\nDavid Williams and Paul McIlroy introduced a mathematical model for the O.K. Corral gunfight, which they published in \"Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society\" (1998). Later this model was analyzed by Sir John Kingman (1999, 2002), and Kingman and Volkov (2003). They analyzed the probability of \"survival of exactly S gunmen given an initially fair configuration.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a potassium salt of nitric acid. This salt consists of potassium cations and nitrate anions , and is therefore an alkali metal nitrate. It occurs in nature as a mineral, niter (or \"nitre\" outside the United States). It is a source of nitrogen, and nitrogen was named after niter. Potassium nitrate is one of several nitrogen-containing compounds collectively referred to as saltpetre (or saltpeter in the United States).\nMajor uses of potassium nitrate are in fertilizers, tree stump removal, rocket propellants and fireworks. It is one of the major constituents of traditional gunpowder (black powder). In processed meats, potassium nitrate reacts with hemoglobin and myoglobin generating a red color.\nEtymology.\nNitre, or potassium nitrate, because of its early and global use and production, has many names.\nAs for nitrate, Egyptian and Hebrew words for it had the consonants n-t-r, indicating likely cognation in the Greek \"nitron\", which was Latinised to \"nitrum\" or \"nitrium\". Thence Old French had \"niter\" and Middle English \"nitre\". By the 15th century, Europeans referred to it as \"saltpetre\", specifically Indian saltpetre (Chilean saltpetre is sodium nitrate) and later as \"nitrate of potash,\" as the chemistry of the compound was more fully understood.\nThe Arabs called it \"Chinese snow\" () as well as \"b\u0101r\u016bd\" (), a term of uncertain origin that later came to mean gunpowder. It was called \"Chinese salt\" by the Iranians/Persians or \"salt from Chinese salt marshes\" ( \"\"). The Tiangong Kaiwu, published in the 17th century by members of the Qing dynasty, detailed the production of gunpowder and other useful products from nature.\nHistorical production.\nFrom mineral sources.\nIn Mauryan India saltpeter manufacturers formed the Nuniya &amp; Labana\ncaste. Saltpeter finds mention in Kautilya's Arthashastra (compiled 300 BC \u2013 300 AD), which mentions using its poisonous smoke as a weapon of war, although its use for propulsion did not appear until medieval times.\nA purification process for potassium nitrate was outlined in 1270 by the chemist and engineer Hasan al-Rammah of Syria in his book \"al-Furusiyya wa al-Manasib al-Harbiyya\" (\"The Book of Military Horsemanship and Ingenious War Devices\"). In this book, al-Rammah describes first the purification of \"barud\" (crude saltpeter mineral) by boiling it with minimal water and using only the hot solution, then the use of potassium carbonate (in the form of wood ashes) to remove calcium and magnesium by precipitation of their carbonates from this solution, leaving a solution of purified potassium nitrate, which could then be dried. This was used for the manufacture of gunpowder and explosive devices. The terminology used by al-Rammah indicated the gunpowder he wrote about originated in China.\nAt least as far back as 1845, nitratite deposits were exploited in Chile and California.\nFrom caves.\nMajor natural sources of potassium nitrate were the deposits crystallizing from cave walls and the accumulations of bat guano in caves. Extraction is accomplished by immersing the guano in water for a day, filtering, and harvesting the crystals in the filtered water. Traditionally, guano was the source used in Laos for the manufacture of gunpowder for \"Bang Fai\" rockets.\nCalcium nitrate, or lime saltpetre, was discovered on the walls of stables, from the urine of barnyard animals.\nNitraries.\nPotassium nitrate was produced in a \"nitrary\" or \"saltpetre works\". The process involved burial of excrements (human or animal) in a field beside the nitraries, watering them and waiting until leaching allowed saltpeter to migrate to the surface by efflorescence. Operators then gathered the resulting powder and transported it to be concentrated by ebullition in the boiler plant.\nBesides \"Montepellusanus\", during the thirteenth century (and beyond) the only supply of saltpeter across Christian Europe (according to \"De Alchimia\" in 3 manuscripts of Michael Scot, 1180\u20131236) was \"found in Spain in Aragon in a certain mountain near the sea\".\nIn 1561, Elizabeth I, Queen of England and Ireland, who was at war with Philip II of Spain, became unable to import saltpeter (of which the Kingdom of England had no home production), and had to pay \"300 pounds gold\" to the German captain Gerrard Honrik for the manual \"Instructions for making saltpeter to growe\" (the secret of the \"Feuerwerkbuch\" -the nitraries-).\nNitre bed.\nA \"nitre bed\" is a similar process used to produce nitrate from excrement. Unlike the leaching-based process of the nitrary, however, one mixes the excrements with soil and waits for soil microbes to convert amino-nitrogen into nitrates by nitrification. The nitrates are extracted from soil with water and then purified into saltpeter by adding wood ash. The process was discovered in the early 15th century and was very widely used until the Chilean mineral deposits were found.\nThe Confederate side of the American Civil War had a significant shortage of saltpeter. As a result, the Nitre and Mining Bureau was set up to encourage local production, including by nitre beds and by providing excrement to government nitraries. On November 13, 1862, the government advertised in the Charleston Daily Courier for 20 or 30 \"able bodied Negro men\" to work in the new nitre beds at Ashley Ferry, S.C. The nitre beds were large rectangles of rotted manure and straw, moistened weekly with urine, \"dung water\", and liquid from privies, cesspools and drains, and turned over regularly. The National Archives published payroll records that account for more than 29,000 people compelled to such labor in the state of Virginia. The South was so desperate for saltpeter for gunpowder that one Alabama official reportedly placed a newspaper ad asking that the contents of chamber pots be saved for collection. In South Carolina, in April 1864, the Confederate government forced 31 enslaved people to work at the Ashley Ferry Nitre Works, outside Charleston.\nPerhaps the most exhaustive discussion of the niter-bed production is the 1862 LeConte text. He was writing with the express purpose of increasing production in the Confederate States to support their needs during the American Civil War. Since he was calling for the assistance of rural farming communities, the descriptions and instructions are both simple and explicit. He details the \"French Method\", along with several variations, as well as a \"Swiss method\".\nFrench method.\nTurgot and Lavoisier created the \"R\u00e9gie des Poudres et Salp\u00eatres\" a few years before the French Revolution. Niter-beds were prepared by mixing manure with either mortar or wood ashes, common earth and organic materials such as straw to give porosity to a compost pile typically high, wide, and long. The heap was usually under a cover from the rain, kept moist with urine, turned often to accelerate the decomposition, then finally leached with water after approximately one year, to remove the soluble calcium nitrate which was then converted to potassium nitrate by filtering through potash.\nSwiss method.\nJoseph LeConte describes a process using only urine and not dung, referring to it as the \"Swiss method\". Urine is collected directly, in a sandpit under a stable. The sand itself is dug out and leached for nitrates which are then converted to potassium nitrate using potash, as above.\nFrom nitric acid.\nFrom 1903 until the World War I era, potassium nitrate for black powder and fertilizer was produced on an industrial scale from nitric acid produced using the Birkeland\u2013Eyde process, which used an electric arc to oxidize nitrogen from the air. During World War I the newly industrialized Haber process (1913) was combined with the Ostwald process after 1915, allowing Germany to produce nitric acid for the war after being cut off from its supplies of mineral sodium nitrates from Chile (see nitratite).\nModern production.\nPotassium nitrate can be made by combining ammonium nitrate and potassium hydroxide.\nAn alternative way of producing potassium nitrate without a by-product of ammonia is to combine ammonium nitrate, found in instant ice packs, and potassium chloride, easily obtained as a sodium-free salt substitute.\nPotassium nitrate can also be produced by neutralizing nitric acid with potassium hydroxide. This reaction is highly exothermic.\nOn industrial scale it is prepared by the double displacement reaction between sodium nitrate and potassium chloride.\nProperties.\nPotassium nitrate has an orthorhombic crystal structure at room temperature, which transforms to a trigonal system at . On cooling from , another trigonal phase forms between and .\nSodium nitrate is isomorphous with calcite, the most stable form of calcium carbonate, whereas room-temperature potassium nitrate is isomorphous with aragonite, a slightly less stable polymorph of calcium carbonate. The difference is attributed to the similarity in size between nitrate () and carbonate () ions and the fact that the potassium ion () is larger than sodium () and calcium () ions.\nIn the room-temperature structure of potassium nitrate, each potassium ion is surrounded by 6 nitrate ions. In turn, each nitrate ion is surrounded by 6 potassium ions.\nPotassium nitrate is moderately soluble in water, but its solubility increases with temperature. The aqueous solution is almost neutral, exhibiting pH 6.2 at for a 10% solution of commercial powder. It is not very hygroscopic, absorbing about 0.03% water in 80% relative humidity over 50 days. It is insoluble in alcohol and is not poisonous; it can react explosively with reducing agents, but it is not explosive on its own.\nThermal decomposition.\nBetween , potassium nitrate reaches a temperature-dependent equilibrium with potassium nitrite:\nUses.\nPotassium nitrate has a wide variety of uses, largely as a source of nitrate.\nNitric acid production.\nHistorically, nitric acid was produced by combining sulfuric acid with nitrates such as saltpeter. In modern times this is reversed: nitrates are produced from nitric acid produced via the Ostwald process.\nOxidizer.\nThe most famous use of potassium nitrate is probably as the oxidizer in blackpowder. From the most ancient times until the late 1880s, blackpowder provided the explosive power for all the world's firearms. After that time, small arms and large artillery increasingly began to depend on cordite, a smokeless powder. Blackpowder remains in use today in black powder rocket motors, but also in combination with other fuels like sugars in \"rocket candy\" (a popular amateur rocket propellant). It is also used in fireworks such as smoke bombs. It is also added to cigarettes to maintain an even burn of the tobacco and is used to ensure complete combustion of paper cartridges for cap and ball revolvers. It can also be heated to several hundred degrees to be used for niter bluing, which is less durable than other forms of protective oxidation, but allows for specific coloration of steel parts, such as screws, pins, and other small parts of firearms.\nMeat processing.\nPotassium nitrate has been a common ingredient of salted meat since antiquity or the Middle Ages. The widespread adoption of nitrate use is more recent and is linked to the development of large-scale meat processing. The use of potassium nitrate has been mostly discontinued because it gives slow and inconsistent results compared with sodium nitrite preparations such as \"Prague powder\" or pink \"curing salt\". Even so, potassium nitrate is still used in some food applications, such as salami, dry-cured ham, charcuterie, and (in some countries) in the brine used to make corned beef (sometimes together with sodium nitrite). In the Shetland Islands (UK) it is used in the curing of mutton to make reestit mutton, a local delicacy. When used as a food additive in the European Union, the compound is referred to as E252; it is also approved for use as a food additive in the United States and Australia and New Zealand (where it is listed under its INS number 252).\nPossible cancer risk.\nSince October 2015, WHO classifies processed meat as Group 1 carcinogen (based on epidemiological studies, convincingly carcinogenic to humans).\nIn April 2023 the French Court of Appeals of Limoges confirmed that food-watch NGO Yuka was legally legitimate in describing Potassium Nitrate E252 as a \"cancer risk\", and thus rejected an appeal by the French industry against the organisation.\nFertilizer.\nPotassium nitrate is used in fertilizers as a source of nitrogen and potassium \u2013 two of the macronutrients for plants. When used by itself, it has an NPK rating of 13-0-44.\nIn folklore and popular culture.\nPotassium nitrate was once thought to induce impotence, and is still rumored to be in institutional food (such as military fare). There is no scientific evidence for such properties.\nIn \"1776\", John Adams asks his wife Abigail to make saltpeter for the Continental Army. She, eventually, is able to do so in exchange for pins for sewing.\nIn the farming lore from the Corn Belt of the 1800s, drought-killed corn in manured fields could accumulate saltpeter to the extent that upon opening the stalk for examination it would \"fall as a fine powder upon the table\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Central to this region is the Iranian plateau, now largely covered by modern Iran. The most pronounced impact of Iranian history can be seen stretching from Anatolia in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, including the Levant, Mesopotamia, the Caucasus, and parts of Central Asia. It also overlaps or mingles with the histories of many other major civilizations, such as India, China, Greece, Rome, and Egypt.\nIran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to the 5th millennium BC. The Iranian plateau's western regions integrated into the rest of the ancient Near East with the Elamites (in Ilam and Khuzestan), the Kassites (in Kuhdesht), the Gutians (in Luristan), and later with other peoples like the Urartians (in Oshnavieh and Sardasht) near Lake Urmia and the Mannaeans (in Piranshahr, Saqqez and Bukan) in Kurdistan. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel called the Persians the \"first Historical People\" in his \"Lectures on the Philosophy of World History\". The sustained Iranian empire is understood to have begun with the rise of the Medes during the Iron Age, when Iran was unified as a nation under the Median kingdom in the 7th century BC. By 550 BC, the Medes were sidelined by the conquests of Cyrus the Great, who brought the Persians to power with the establishment of the Achaemenid Empire. Cyrus' ensuing campaigns enabled the Persian realm's expansion across most of West Asia and much of Central Asia, and his successors would eventually conquer parts of Southeast Europe and North Africa to preside over the largest empire the world had yet seen. In the 4th century BC, the Achaemenid Empire was conquered by the Macedonian Empire of Alexander the Great, whose death led to the establishment of the Seleucid Empire over the bulk of former Achaemenid territory. In the following century, Greek rule of the Iranian plateau came to an end with the rise of the Parthian Empire, which also conquered large parts of the Seleucids' Anatolian, Mesopotamian, and Central Asian holdings. While the Parthians were succeeded by the Sasanian Empire in the 2nd century, Iran remained a leading power for the next millennium, although the majority of this period was marked by the Roman\u2013Persian Wars.\nCommon Era.\nIn the 7th century, the Muslim conquest of Iran resulted in the Sasanian Empire's annexation by the Rashidun Caliphate and the beginning of the Islamization of Iran. In spite of repeated invasions by foreign powers, such as the Arabs, Turks, and Mongols, among others, the Iranian national identity was repeatedly asserted in the face of assimilation, allowing it to develop as a distinct political and cultural entity. While the early Muslim conquests had caused the decline of Zoroastrianism, which had been Iran's majority and official religion up to that point, the achievements of prior Iranian civilizations were absorbed into the nascent Islamic empires and expanded upon during the Islamic Golden Age. Nomadic tribes overran parts of the Iranian plateau during the Late Middle Ages and into the early modern period, negatively impacting the region. By 1501, however, the nation was reunified by the Safavid dynasty, which initiated Iranian history's most momentous religious change since the original Muslim conquest by converting Iran to Shia Islam. Iran again emerged as a leading world power, especially in rivalry with the Turkish-ruled Ottoman Empire. In the 19th century, Iran came into conflict with the Russian Empire, which annexed the South Caucasus by the end of the Russo-Persian Wars.\nThe Safavid period (1501\u20131736) is becoming more recognized as an important time in Iran's history by scholars in both Iran and the West. In 1501, the Safavid dynasty became the first local dynasty to rule all of Iran since the Arabs overthrew the Sasanid empire in the 7th century. For eight and a half centuries, Iran was mostly just a geographical area with no independent government, ruled by various foreign powers\u2014Arabs, Turks, Mongols, and Tartars. The Mongol invasions in the 13th century were a turning point in Iran's history and in Islam. The Mongols destroyed the historical caliphate, which had been a symbol of unity for the Islamic world for 600 years. During the long foreign rule, Iranians kept their unique culture and national identity, and they used this chance to regain their political independence.\nIn the 1940s there were hopes that Iran could become a constitutional monarchy, but a 1953 coup aided by U.S. and U.K. removed the elected prime minister, and Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian monarchy lasted until the Islamic Revolution in 1979, when the country was officially declared an Islamic republic. Since then, it has experienced significant political, social, and economic changes. The establishment of an Islamic republic led to a major restructuring of the country's political system. Iran's foreign relations have been shaped by regional conflicts, beginning with the Iran\u2013Iraq War and persisting through many Arab countries; ongoing tensions with Israel, the United States, and the Western world; and the Iranian nuclear program, which has been a point of contention in international diplomacy. Despite international sanctions and internal challenges, Iran remains a key player in regional and global geopolitics.\nPrehistory.\nPaleolithic.\nThe earliest archaeological artifacts in Iran were found in the Kashafrud and Ganj Par sites that are thought to date back to 100,000 years ago in the Middle Paleolithic. Mousterian stone tools made by Neanderthals have also been found. There are more cultural remains of Neanderthals dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period, which mainly have been found in the Zagros region and fewer in central Iran at sites such as Kobeh, Kunji, Bisitun Cave, Tamtama, Warwasi, and Yafteh Cave. In 1949, a Neanderthal radius was discovered by Carleton S. Coon in Bisitun Cave. Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros Mountains in the caves of Kermanshah and Khorramabad and a few number of sites in Piranshahr, Alborz and Central Iran. During this time, people began creating rock art in Iran.\nNeolithic to Chalcolithic.\nEarly agricultural communities such as Chogha Golan in the 11th millennium BC along with settlements such as Chogha Bonut (the earliest village in Elam) in the 9th millennium BC began to flourish in and around the Zagros Mountains. Around about the same time, the earliest-known clay vessels and modelled human and animal terracotta figurines were produced at Ganj Dareh. There are 10,000-year-old human and animal figurines from Tepe Sarab in Kermanshah Province among many other ancient artefacts.\nThe south-western part of Iran was part of the Fertile Crescent where most of humanity's first major crops were grown, in villages such as Susa (where a settlement was first founded possibly as early as 4395 BC) and settlements such as Chogha Mish, dating back to 6800 BC; there are 7,000-year-old jars of wine excavated in the Zagros Mountains (now on display at the University of Pennsylvania) and ruins of 7,000-year-old settlements such as Tepe Sialk are further testament to that. The two main Neolithic Iranian settlements were Ganj Dareh and the hypothetical Zayandeh River Culture.\nBronze Age.\nThe Kura\u2013Araxes culture (circa 3400 BC\u2014ca. 2000 BC) stretched from northwestern Iran up into the neighbouring regions of the Caucasus and Anatolia. Susa is one of the oldest-known settlements of Iran and the world. The general perception among archaeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, hence incorporating many aspects of Mesopotamian culture. In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state founded 4000 BC. There are also dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC. One of the earliest civilizations on the Iranian plateau was the Jiroft culture in southeastern Iran in the province of Kerman.\nIran is one of the most artefact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East. Archaeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC. There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs. The objects and their iconography are considered unique. Many are made from chlorite, a grey-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli. Recent excavations at the sites have produced the world's earliest inscription which pre-dates Mesopotamian inscriptions.\nThere are records of numerous other ancient civilizations on the Iranian plateau before the emergence of Iranian peoples during the Early Iron Age. The Early Bronze Age saw the rise of urbanization into organized city-states and the invention of writing (the Uruk period) in the Near East. While Bronze Age Elam made use of writing from an early time, the Proto-Elamite script remains undeciphered, and records from Sumer pertaining to Elam are scarce.\nRussian historian Igor M. Diakonoff states that the modern inhabitants of Iran are descendants of mainly non-Indo-European groups, more specifically of pre-Iranic inhabitants of the Iranian Plateau: \"It is the autochthones of the Iranian plateau, and not the Proto-Indo-European tribes of Europe, which are, in the main, the ancestors, in the physical sense of the word, of the present-day Iranians.\"\nEarly Iron Age.\nRecords become more tangible with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and its records of incursions from the Iranian plateau. As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian plateau from the Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe. The arrival of Iranians on the Iranian plateau forced the Elamites to relinquish one area of their empire after another and to take refuge in Elam, Khuzestan and the nearby area, which only then became coterminous with Elam. Bahman Firuzmandi says that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau. By the mid-1st millennium BC, Medes, Persians, and Parthians populated the Iranian plateau. Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under Assyrian domination, like the rest of the Near East. In the first half of the 1st millennium BC, parts of what is now Iranian Azerbaijan were incorporated into Urartu.\nClassical antiquity.\nMedian and Achaemenid Empires (678\u2013330 BC).\nIn 646 BC, Assyrian king Ashurbanipal sacked Susa, which ended Elamite supremacy in the region. For over 150 years Assyrian kings of nearby northern Mesopotamia had been wanting to conquer Median tribes of western Iran. Under pressure from Assyria, the small kingdoms of the western Iranian plateau coalesced into increasingly larger and more centralized states.\nIn the second half of the 7th century BC, the Medes gained their independence and were united by Deioces. In 612 BC, Cyaxares, Deioces' grandson, and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar invaded Assyria and laid siege to and eventually destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, which led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Urartu was later on conquered and dissolved as well by the Medes. The Medes are credited with founding Iran as a nation and empire, and established the first Iranian empire, the largest of its day until Cyrus the Great established a unified empire of the Medes and Persians, leading to the Achaemenid Empire (c. 550\u2013330 BC).\nCyrus the Great overthrew, in turn, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria. He was better able, through more benign policies, to reconcile his subjects to Persian rule; the longevity of his empire was one result. The Persian king, like the Assyrian, was also \"King of Kings\", \"x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iya x\u0161\u0101ya\u03b8iy\u0101n\u0101m\" (\"sh\u0101hansh\u0101h\" in modern Persian) \u2013 \"great king\", Megas Basileus, as known by the Greeks.\nCyrus's son, Cambyses II, conquered the last major power of the region, ancient Egypt, causing the collapse of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt. Since he became ill and died before, or while, leaving Egypt, stories developed, as related by Herodotus, that he was struck down for impiety against the ancient Egyptian deities. After the death of Cambyses II, Darius ascended the throne by overthrowing the legitimate Achaemenid monarch Bardiya, and then quelling rebellions throughout his kingdom. As the winner, Darius based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the Achaemenid Empire.\nDarius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at Persepolis. He rebuilt a canal between the Nile and the Red Sea, a forerunner of the modern Suez Canal. He improved the extensive road system, and it is during his reign that mentions are first made of the Royal Road (shown on map), a great highway stretching all the way from Susa to Sardis with posting stations at regular intervals. Major reforms took place under Darius. Coinage, in the form of the \"daric\" (gold coin) and the shekel (silver coin), was standardized (coinage had been invented over a century before in Lydia c. 660 BC but not standardized), and administrative efficiency increased.\nThe Old Persian language appears in royal inscriptions, written in a specially adapted version of the cuneiform script. Under Cyrus the Great and Darius, the Persian Empire eventually became the largest empire in human history up until that point, ruling and administrating over most of the known world, as well as spanning the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The greatest achievement was the empire itself. The Persian Empire represented the world's first superpower that was based on a model of tolerance and respect for other cultures and religions.\nIn the late 6th century BC, Darius launched his European campaign, in which he defeated the Paeonians, conquered Thrace, and subdued all coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating the European Scythians around the Danube river. In 512/511 BC, Macedon became a vassal kingdom of Persia.\nIn 499 BC, Athens lent support to a revolt in Miletus, which resulted in the sacking of Sardis. This led to an Achaemenid campaign against mainland Greece known as the Greco-Persian Wars, which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC, and is known as one of the most important wars in European history. In the First Persian invasion of Greece, the Persian general Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia. The war eventually turned out in defeat, however. Darius' successor Xerxes I launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece. At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including all territories to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth, however, this was also turned out in a Greek victory, following the battles of Plataea and Salamis, by which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and eventually withdrew from it. During the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians gained major territorial advantages. They captured and razed Athens twice, once in 480 BC and again in 479 BC. However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw, thus losing control of Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. Fighting continued for several decades after the successful Greek repelling of the Second Invasion with numerous Greek city-states under the Athens' newly formed Delian League, which eventually ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC, ending the Greco-Persian Wars. In 404 BC, following the death of Darius II, Egypt rebelled under Amyrtaeus. Later pharaohs successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by Artaxerxes III.\nGreek conquest and Seleucid Empire (312 BC\u2013248 BC).\nFrom 334 BC to 331 BC, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III in the battles of Granicus, Issus and Gaugamela, swiftly conquering the Achaemenid Empire by 331 BC. Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death, and Alexander's general, Seleucus I Nicator, tried to take control of Iran, Mesopotamia, and later Syria and Anatolia. His empire was the Seleucid Empire. He was killed in 281 BC by Ptolemy Keraunos.\nParthian Empire (248 BC\u2013224 AD).\nThe Parthian Empire\u2014ruled by the Parthians, a group of northwestern Iranian people\u2014was the realm of the Arsacid dynasty. This latter reunited and governed the Iranian plateau after the Parni conquest of Parthia and defeating the Seleucid Empire in the late 3rd century BC. It intermittently controlled Mesopotamia between c.\u2009150 BC and 224 AD and absorbed Eastern Arabia.\nParthia was the eastern arch-enemy of the Roman Empire, and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia). The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily armed and armored cataphracts and the lightly armed but highly-mobile mounted archers.\nFor the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers. The Parthian shot used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the Battle of Carrhae. On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in siege warfare. Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to annex each other's territory.\nThe Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires. The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire's organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians. However, the Arsacid dynasty continued to exist for centuries onwards in Armenia, the Iberia, and the Caucasian Albania, which were all eponymous branches of the dynasty.\nSasanian Empire (224\u2013651 AD).\nThe first shah of the Sasanian Empire, Ardashir I, started reforming the country economically and militarily. For a period of more than 400 years, Iran was once again one of the leading powers in the world, alongside its neighbouring rival, the Roman and then Byzantine Empires. The empire's territory, at its height, encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Abkhazia, Dagestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, parts of Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, parts of Pakistan, Central Asia, Eastern Arabia, and parts of Egypt.\nMost of the Sasanian Empire's lifespan was overshadowed by the frequent Byzantine\u2013Sasanian wars, a continuation of the Roman\u2013Parthian Wars and the all-comprising Roman\u2013Persian Wars; the last was the longest-lasting conflict in human history. Started in the first century BC by their predecessors, the Parthians, and Romans, the last Roman\u2013Persian War was fought in the seventh century. The Persians defeated the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 260 and took emperor Valerian prisoner for the remainder of his life. Eastern Arabia was conquered early on. During Khosrow II's rule in 590\u2013628, Egypt, Jordan, Palestine and Lebanon were also annexed to the Empire. The Sassanians called their empire \"Er\u00e2nshahr\" (\"Dominion of the Aryans\", i.e., of Iranians).\nA chapter of Iran's history followed after roughly 600 years of conflict with the Roman Empire. During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in Anatolia, the western Caucasus (mainly Lazica and the Kingdom of Iberia; modern-day Georgia and Abkhazia), Mesopotamia, Armenia and the Levant. Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians. However, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a \"casus belli\" to attack the Empire. After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace. With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman\u2013Persian Wars through the climactic Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628, which included the very siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, the war-exhausted Persians lost the Battle of al-Q\u0101disiyyah (632) in Hilla (present-day Iraq) to the invading Muslim forces.\nThe Sasanian era, encompassing the length of Late Antiquity, is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world. In many ways, the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam. Persia influenced Roman civilization considerably during Sassanian times, their cultural influence extending far beyond the empire's territorial borders, reaching as far as Western Europe, Africa, China and India and also playing a prominent role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art.\nThis influence carried forward to the Muslim world. The dynasty's unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance. Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing, and other contributions to civilization, were taken from the Sassanian Persians into the broader Muslim world.\nMedieval period.\nEarly Islamic period.\nIslamic conquest of Persia (633\u2013651).\nIn 633, when the Sasanian king Yazdegerd III was ruling over Iran, the Muslims under Umar invaded the country right after it had been in a bloody civil war. Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the House of Karen, and later Kanarangiyans of Khorasan, mutinied against their Sasanian overlords. Although the House of Mihran had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals Bahr\u0101m Ch\u014dbin and Shahrbaraz, it remained loyal to the Sasanians during its struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the House of Ispahbudhan, under their leader Farrukhzad, who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III. Yazdegerd III fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at Merv in 651. By 674, Muslims had conquered Khorasan (which included Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of Transoxiana).\nThe Muslim conquest of Persia ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam. Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded but were absorbed by the new Islamic polity. As Bernard Lewis has commented:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;These events have been variously seen in Iran: by some as a blessing, the advent of the true faith, the end of the age of ignorance and heathenism; by others as a humiliating national defeat, the conquest and subjugation of the country by foreign invaders. Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision.\nUmayyad era and Muslim incursions into the Caspian coast.\nAfter the fall of the Sasanian Empire in 651, the Arabs of the Umayyad Caliphate adopted many Persian customs, especially the administrative and the court mannerisms. Arab provincial governors were undoubtedly either Persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the 7th century, when in 692 minting began at the capital Damascus. The Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian coins (as well as Byzantine), and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic alphabet.\nDuring the Umayyad Caliphate, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who was not happy with the prevalence of the Persian language in the divan, ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force. In al-Biruni's \"From the Remaining Signs of Past Centuries\" for example it is written:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Qutaibah bin Muslim under the command of Al-Hajjaj bin Yousef was sent to Khwarazmia with a military expedition and conquered it for the second time, he swiftly killed whoever wrote the Khwarazmian native language that knew of the Khwarazmian heritage, history, and culture. He then killed all their Zoroastrian priests and burned and wasted their books, until gradually the illiterate only remained, who knew nothing of writing, and hence their history was mostly forgotten.\nSeveral historians see the rule of the Umayyads as setting up the \"dhimmah\" to increase taxes from the \"dhimmis\" to benefit the Muslim Arab community financially and by discouraging conversion. Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues. In the 7th century, when many non-Arabs such as Persians entered Islam, they were recognized as mawali (\"clients\") and treated as second-class citizens by the ruling Arab elite until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate. During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of \"mawali\". The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.\nHowever, all of Iran was still not under Arab control; the region of Daylam was under the control of the Daylamites, while Tabaristan was under Dabuyid and Paduspanid control, and the Mount Damavand region was under Masmughans of Damavand. The Arabs had invaded these regions several times but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions. The most prominent ruler of the Dabuyids, known as Farrukhan the Great (r. 712\u2013728), managed to hold his domains during his long struggle against the Arab general Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, who was defeated by a combined Dailamite-Dabuyid army and was forced to retreat from Tabaristan.\nWith the death of the Umayyad Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik in 743, the Islamic world was launched into civil war. Abu Muslim was sent to Khorasan by the Abbasid Caliphate initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf. He took Merv defeating the Umayyad governor Nasr ibn Sayyar. He became the de facto Abbasid governor of Khurasan. During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid declared independence from the Umayyads but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority. In 750, Abu Muslim became the leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab. Abu Muslim stormed Damascus later that year.\nAbbasid period and autonomous Iranian dynasties.\nThe Abbasid army consisted primarily of Khorasanians and was led by Abu Muslim. It contained both Iranian and Arab elements, and the Abbasids enjoyed both Iranian and Arab support. The Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750. According to Amir Arjomand, the Abbasid Revolution essentially marked the end of the Arab empire and the beginning of a more inclusive, multi-ethnic state in the Middle East. One of the first changes the Abbasids made after taking power from the Umayyads was to move the empire's capital to Iraq. The latter region was influenced by Persian history and culture, and moving the capital was part of the Persian mawali demand for Arab influence in the empire. The city of Baghdad was constructed on the Tigris River, in 762, to serve as the Abbasid capital.\nThe Abbasids established the position of vizier like Barmakids in their administration, which was the equivalent of a \"vice-caliph\", or second-in-command. Eventually, this change meant that many caliphs under the Abbasids ended up in a much more ceremonial role than ever before, with the vizier in real power. A new Persian bureaucracy began to replace the old Arab aristocracy, and the entire administration reflected these changes, demonstrating that the new dynasty was different in many ways from the Umayyads.\nBy the 9th century, Abbasid control began to wane as regional leaders sprang up in the far corners of the empire to challenge the central authority of the Abbasid caliphate. The Abbasid caliphs began enlisting \"mamluks\", Turkic-speaking warriors, who had been moving out of Central Asia into Transoxiana as slave warriors as early as the 9th century. Shortly thereafter the real power of the Abbasid caliphs began to wane; eventually, they became religious figureheads while the warrior slaves ruled.\nThe 9th century also saw the revolt by native Zoroastrians, known as the Khurramites, against oppressive Arab rule. The movement was led by a Persian freedom fighter Babak Khorramdin. Babak's Iranianizing rebellion, from its base in Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, called for a return of the political glories of the Iranian past. The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the western and central parts of Iran and lasted more than 20 years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed by Afshin, a senior general of the Abbasid Caliphate.\nAs the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power. Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (821\u2013873); the Saffarids in Sistan (861\u20131003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the Samanids (819\u20131005), originally at Bukhara. The Samanids eventually ruled an area from central Iran to Pakistan.\nBy the early 10th century, the Abbasids almost lost control to the growing Persian faction known as the Buyid dynasty (934\u20131062). Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad. The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the Seljuq Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them. The balance of power in Baghdad remained as such \u2013 with the Abbasids in power in name only \u2013 until the Mongol invasion of 1258 sacked the city and definitively ended the Abbasid dynasty.\nDuring the Abbasid period an enfranchisement was experienced by the \"mawali\" and a shift was made in political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire and c. 930 a requirement was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire be Muslim.\nIslamic golden age, Shu'ubiyya movement and Persianization process.\nIslamization was a long process by which Islam was gradually adopted by the majority population of Iran. Richard Bulliet's \"conversion curve\" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric Umayyad period. Beginning in the Abbasid period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose. As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 90% by the end of the 11th century. Seyyed Hossein Nasr suggests that the rapid increase in conversion was aided by the Persian nationality of the rulers. Although Persians adopted the religion of their conquerors, over the centuries they worked to protect and revive their distinctive language and culture, a process known as Persianization. Arabs and Turks participated in this attempt.\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, non-Arab subjects of the Ummah created a movement called Shu'ubiyyah in response to the privileged status of Arabs. Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested. Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context.\nThe Samanid dynasty led the revival of Persian culture and the first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings. The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals. Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture.\nThe culmination of the Persianization movement was the \"Shahnameh\", the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian. This voluminous work, reflects Iran's ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion, and its sense of nationhood. According to Bernard Lewis:\nIran was indeed Islamized, but it was not Arabized. Persians remained Persians. And after an interval of silence, Iran re-emerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself. Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance. The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavour, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution. In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam. It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India. The Ottoman Turks brought a form of Iranian civilization to the walls of Vienna...\nThe Islamization of Iran was to yield deep transformations within the cultural, scientific, and political structure of Iran's society: The blossoming of Persian literature, philosophy, medicine and art became major elements of the newly forming Muslim civilization. Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the \"crossroads of the major cultural highways\", contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the \"Islamic Golden Age\". During this period, hundreds of scholars and scientists vastly contributed to technology, science and medicine, later influencing the rise of European science during the Renaissance.\nThe most important scholars of almost all of the Islamic sects and schools of thought were Persian or lived in Iran, including the most notable and reliable Hadith collectors of Shia and Sunni like Shaikh Saduq, Shaikh Kulainy, Hakim al-Nishaburi, Imam Muslim and Imam Bukhari, the greatest theologians of Shia and Sunni like Shaykh Tusi, Imam Ghazali, Imam Fakhr al-Razi and Al-Zamakhshari, the greatest physicians, astronomers, logicians, mathematicians, metaphysicians, philosophers and scientists like Avicenna and Nas\u012br al-D\u012bn al-T\u016bs\u012b, and the greatest shaykhs of Sufism like Rumi and Abdul-Qadir Gilani.\nPersianate states and dynasties (977\u20131219).\nIn 977, a Turkic governor of the Samanids, Sabuktigin, conquered Ghazna (in present-day Afghanistan) and established a dynasty, the Ghaznavids, that lasted to 1186. The Ghaznavid empire grew by taking all of the Samanid territories south of the Amu Darya in the last decade of the 10th century, and eventually occupied parts of Eastern Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and north-west India. The Ghaznavids are generally credited with launching Islam into a mainly Hindu India. The invasion of India was undertaken in 1000 by the Ghaznavid ruler Mahmud and continued for several years. They were unable to hold power for long, however, particularly after the death of Mahmud in 1030. By 1040 the Seljuqs had taken over the Ghaznavid lands in Iran.\nThe Seljuqs, who like the Ghaznavids were Persianate in nature and of Turkic origin, slowly conquered Iran over the course of the 11th century. The dynasty had its origins in the Turcoman tribal confederations of Central Asia and marked the beginning of Turkic power in the Middle East. They established a Sunni Muslim rule over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries. They set the Seljuq Empire that stretched from Anatolia in the west to western Afghanistan in the east and the western borders of modern-day China in the north-east; and was the target of the First Crusade. Today they are regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Turkey, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, and they are remembered as great patrons of Persian culture, art, literature, and language.\nThe founder of the dynasty, Tughril Beg, turned his army against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan. He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path. In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East. Under Tughril Beg's successor, Malik Shah (1072\u20131092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk. These leaders established the observatory where Omar Khayy\u00e1m did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns. They brought Abu Hamid Ghazali, one of the greatest Islamic theologians, and other eminent scholars to the Seljuq capital at Baghdad and encouraged and supported their work.\nWhen Malik Shah I died in 1092, the empire split as his brother and four sons quarreled over the apportioning of the empire among themselves. In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by Kilij Arslan I who founded the Sultanate of R\u00fbm and in Syria by his brother Tutush I. In Persia he was succeeded by his son Mahmud I whose reign was contested by his other three brothers Barkiyaruq in Iraq, Muhammad I in Baghdad and Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan. As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the Khwarezmshahs. The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia. Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran. In 1194 the Khwarezmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish defeated the Seljuq sultan Toghrul III in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed. Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia remained.\nA serious internal threat to the Seljuqs during their reign came from the Nizari Ismailis, a secret sect with headquarters at Alamut Castle between Rasht and Tehran. They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials. Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word \"assassin\" derive from these killers. Parts of northwestern Iran were conquered in the early 13th century AD by the Kingdom of Georgia, led by Tamar the Great.\nMongol conquest and rule (1219\u20131358).\nMongol invasion (1219\u20131221).\nThe Khwarazmian dynasty only lasted for a few decades, until the arrival of the Mongols. Genghis Khan had unified the Mongols, and under him the Mongol Empire quickly expanded in several directions. In 1218, it bordered Khwarezm. At that time, the Khwarazmian Empire was ruled by Ala ad-Din Muhammad (1200\u20131220). Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran. He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph Al-Nasir. When the caliph rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad proclaimed one of his nobles caliph and unsuccessfully tried to depose an-Nasir.\nThe Mongol invasion of Iran began in 1219, after two diplomatic missions to Khwarezm sent by Genghis Khan had been massacred. During 1220\u201321 Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the populations were slaughtered. The Khwarezm-Shah fled, to die on an island off the Caspian coast. During the invasion of Transoxiana in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle; they were used again in 1220 in Transoxania. The Chinese may have used the catapults to hurl gunpowder bombs, since they already had them by this time.\nWhile Genghis Khan was conquering Transoxania and Persia, several Chinese who were familiar with gunpowder were serving in Genghis's army. \"Whole regiments\" entirely made out of Chinese were used by the Mongols to command bomb hurling trebuchets during the invasion of Iran. Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia. One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar. Books written around the area afterward depicted gunpowder weapons which resembled those of China.\nBefore his death in 1227, Genghis had reached western Azerbaijan, pillaging and burning many cities along the way after entering into Iran from its north east. The Mongol invasion was by and large disastrous to the Iranians. Although the Mongol invaders eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction in Iran and other regions of the Islamic heartland (particularly the historical Khorasan region, mainly in Central Asia) marked a major change of direction for the region. Much of the six centuries of Islamic scholarship, culture, and infrastructure was destroyed as the invaders leveled cities, burned libraries, and in some cases replaced mosques with Buddhist temples. The Mongols killed many Iranian civilians. Destruction of qanat irrigation systems in the north east of Iran destroyed the pattern of relatively continuous settlements, producing many abandoned towns which were relatively quite good with irrigation and agriculture. In 1221, Genghis Khan destroyed the city of Gurganj. Most if not all the ancient Iranic Khwarazmian people were killed or pushed out, paving the way for the Turkification of Khwarazm.\nIlkhanate (1256\u20131335).\nAfter Genghis's death, Iran was ruled by several Mongol commanders. Genghis' grandson, Hulagu Khan, was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion. However, by the time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions. Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next 80 years and become Persian in the process.\nHulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death. The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the Mamelukes, however, at the Battle of Ain Jalut in Palestine in 1260. Hulagu's campaigns against the Muslims also enraged Berke, khan of the Golden Horde and a convert to Islam. Hulagu and Berke fought against each other, demonstrating the weakening unity of the Mongol empire.\nThe rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, Ghazan (1295\u20131304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, Rashid al-Din, brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival. The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes. As a result, commerce increased dramatically.\nItems from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran. For example, Iranians developed a style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China. After Ghazan's nephew Abu Said died in 1335 the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties \u2013 most prominently the Jalayirids, Muzaffarids, Sarbadars and Kartids. The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country's population.\nSunnism and Shiism in pre-Safavid Iran.\nPrior to the rise of the Safavid Empire, Sunni Islam was the dominant religion, accounting for around 90% of the population at the time. According to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids. The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran. The writers of The Four Books of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars.\nThe domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period. There were however some exceptions to this general domination which emerged in the form of the Zayd\u012bs of Tabaristan (see Alid dynasties of northern Iran), the Buyids, the Kakuyids, the rule of Sultan Muhammad Khudabandah (r. Shawwal 703-Shawwal 716/1304\u20131316) and the Sarbedaran.\nApart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, original Imami Shiism as well as Zayd\u012b Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah. Shiism was the dominant sect in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar. In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.\nDuring the 10th and 11th centuries, Fatimids sent Ismailis Da'i (missioners) to Iran as well as other Muslim lands. When Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in Iran. Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured Alamut in 1090 AD. Nizaris used this fortress until a Mongol raid in 1256.\nAfter the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered. Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official madhhab. Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose centre wasn't in Iran at that time. Several local Shia dynasties like Sarbadars were established during this time.\nThe main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when Ismail I founded the Safavid dynasty and initiated a religious policy to recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi'ite state is a direct result of Ismail's actions.\nTimurid Empire (1370\u20131507).\nIran remained divided until the arrival of Timur, a Turco-Mongol belonging to the Timurid dynasty. Like its predecessors, the Timurid Empire was also part of the Persianate world. After establishing a power base in Transoxiana, Timur invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it. Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.\nHis regime was characterized by tyranny and bloodshed, but also by its inclusion of Iranians in administrative roles and its promotion of architecture and poetry. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to Black Sheep Turkmen. The Black Sheep Turkmen were conquered by the White Sheep Turkmen under Uzun Hasan in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.\nSufi poet Hafez's popularity became firmly established in the Timurid era that saw the compilation and widespread copying of his \"divan\". Sufis were often persecuted by orthodox Muslims who considered their teachings blasphemous. Sufism developed a symbolic language rich with metaphors to obscure poetic references to provocative philosophical teachings. Hafez concealed his own Sufi faith, even as he employed the secret language of Sufism (developed over hundreds of years) in his own work, and he is sometimes credited with having \"brought it to perfection\". His work was imitated by Jami, whose own popularity grew to spread across the full breadth of the Persianate world. \nThe Kara Koyunlu were a Turkmen tribal federation that ruled over northwestern Iran and surrounding areas from 1374 to 1468. The Kara Koyunlu expanded their conquest to Baghdad, however, internal fighting, defeats by the Timurids, rebellions by the Armenians in response to their persecution, and failed struggles with the Ag Qoyunlu led to their eventual demise. Aq Qoyunlu were Turkmen under the leadership of the Bayandur tribe, tribal federation of Sunni Muslims who ruled over most of Iran and large parts of surrounding areas from 1378 to 1501 CE. Aq Qoyunlu emerged when Timur granted them all of Diyar Bakr in present-day Turkey. Afterward, they struggled with their rival Oghuz Turks, the Qara Qoyunlu. While the Aq Qoyunlu were successful in defeating Kara Koyunlu, their struggle with the emerging Safavid dynasty led to their downfall.\nEarly modern period.\nPersia underwent a revival under the Safavid dynasty (1501\u20131736), the most prominent figure of which was Shah Abbas I. Some historians credit the Safavid dynasty for founding the modern nation-state of Iran. Iran's contemporary Shia character and significant segments of Iran's current borders take their origin from this era (\"e.g. Treaty of Zuhab\").\nSafavid Empire (1501\u20131736).\nThe Safavid dynasty was one of the most significant ruling dynasties of Iran and \"is often considered the beginning of modern Persian history\". They ruled one of the greatest Iranian empires after the Muslim conquest of Persia and established the Twelver school of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in Muslim history. The Safavids ruled from 1501 to 1722 (experiencing a brief restoration from 1729 to 1736) and at their height, they controlled all of modern Iran, Azerbaijan and Armenia, most of Georgia, the North Caucasus, Iraq, Kuwait and Afghanistan, as well as parts of Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic \"gunpowder empires\", along with its neighbours, its archrival and principal enemy the Ottoman Empire, and to the east, the Mughal Empire.\nThe Safavid ruling dynasty was founded by Ism\u0101il, who styled himself Sh\u0101h Ism\u0101il I. Practically worshipped by his Qizilb\u0101sh followers, Ism\u0101il invaded Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Shaykh Haydar, who had been killed during his siege of Derbent, in Dagestan. Afterwards he went on a campaign of conquest, and following the capture of Tabriz in July 1501, he enthroned himself as the Sh\u0101h of Iran, minted coins in this name, and proclaimed Shi'ism the official religion of his domain.\nAlthough initially the masters of Azerbaijan and southern Dagestan only, the Safavids had, in fact, won the struggle for power in Iran which had been going on for nearly a century between various dynasties and political forces following the fragmentation of the Kara Koyunlu and the Aq Qoyunlu. A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ism\u0101il proclaimed most of Iran as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule. Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts of what is now Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples).\nTahmasp I, the son and successor of Ismail I, carried out multiple invasions in the Caucasus which had been incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands. Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society. As \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica\" states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement. With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the undisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the \"ghazis\" of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic.\nShah Abbas I and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 Georgians, 300,000 Armenians and 100,000\u2013150,000 Circassians to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society. With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the Caucasian ghulams. These new Caucasian elements (the so-called \"ghilman\" / \u063a\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0646 / \"servants\"), almost always after conversion to Shi'ism depending on given function would be, unlike the Qizilbash, fully loyal only to the Shah. The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the harem, regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc. This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the Qajar dynasty.\nThe greatest of the Safavid monarchs, Shah Abbas I the Great (1587\u20131629) came to power in 1587 aged 16. Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1578\u20131590). Then he turned against the Ottomans, the archrivals of the Safavids, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq, the Caucasian provinces, and beyond by 1618. Between 1616 and 1618, following the disobedience of his most loyal Georgian subjects Teimuraz I and Luarsab II, Abbas carried out a punitive campaign in his territories of Georgia, devastating Kakheti and Tbilisi and carrying away 130,000 \u2013 200,000 Georgian captives towards mainland Iran. His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the above-mentioned 1603\u20131618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength. He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf.\nHe expanded commercial links with the Dutch East India Company and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the Habsburg\u2013Persian alliance. Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control.\nThe Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot. It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran. Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which Isfahan is the most notable example.\nExcept for Shah Abbas the Great, Shah Ismail I, Shah Tahmasp I, and Shah Abbas II, many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities. The end of Abbas II's reign in 1666, marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles. Shah Soltan Hosain (1694\u20131722) in particular was known for his love of wine and disinterest in governance.\nThe declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan. In 1722, Peter the Great of neighbouring Imperial Russia launched the Russo-Persian War (1722\u20131723), capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including Derbent, Shaki, Baku, but also Gilan, Mazandaran and Astrabad. In the midst of chaos, in the same year of 1722, an Afghan army led by Mir Wais' son Mahmud marched across eastern Iran, besieged and took Isfahan. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves. By these events, the Safavid dynasty had effectively ended. In 1724, conform the Treaty of Constantinople, the Ottomans and the Russians agreed to divide large portions of Iran, which they had conquered between themselves.\nNader Shah and his successors.\nIran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian Turkic Afshar warlord from Khorasan, Nader Shah. He defeated and banished the Afghans, defeated the Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Iran's Caucasian territories, with the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja. By 1736, Nader had become so powerful he was able to depose the Safavids and have himself crowned shah. Nader was one of the last great conquerors of Asia and briefly presided over what was probably the most powerful military force in the world. To financially support his wars against Iran's arch-rival, the Ottoman Empire, he fixed his sights on the weak but rich Mughal Empire to the east. In 1739, accompanied by his loyal Caucasian subjects including Erekle II, he invaded Mughal India, defeated a numerically superior Mughal army in less than three hours, and completely sacked and looted Delhi, bringing back immense wealth to Iran. On his way back, he also conquered all the Uzbek khanates \u2013 except for Kokand \u2013 and made the Uzbeks his vassals. He also firmly re-established Iranian rule over the entire Caucasus, Bahrain, as well as large parts of Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Undefeated for years, his defeat in Dagestan, following guerrilla rebellions by the Lezgins and the assassination attempt on him near Mazandaran is often considered the turning point in Nader's impressive career. To his frustration, the Dagestanis resorted to guerrilla warfare, and Nader with his conventional army could make little headway against them. At the Battle of Andalal and the Battle of Avaria, Nader's army was crushingly defeated and he lost half of his entire force, forcing him to flee for the mountains. Though Nader managed to take most of Dagestan during his campaign, the effective guerrilla warfare as deployed by the Lezgins, but also the Avars and Laks, made the Iranian re-conquest of the particular North Caucasian region this time a short lived one; several years later, Nader was forced to withdraw. Around the same time, an assassination attempt was made on him near, which accelerated his descent into paranoia and megalomania. He blinded his sons, whom he suspected of the assassination attempts, and showed increasing cruelty against his subjects and officers. In his later years, this eventually provoked multiple revolts and, ultimately, his assassination in 1747.\nNader Shah's death was followed by a period of anarchy as rival army commanders fought for power. Nader's own family, the Afsharids, were soon reduced to holding on to a small domain in Khorasan. Many of the Caucasian territories broke away in various Caucasian khanates. Ottomans regained lost territories in Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence. Ahmad Shah Durrani, one of Nader's officers, founded an independent state which eventually became modern Afghanistan. Erekle II and Teimuraz II, who in 1744 had been made the kings of Kakheti and Kartli respectively by Nader for their loyal service, capitalized on the eruption of instability and declared \"de facto\" independence. Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia. Due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain \"de facto\" autonomous through the Zand period. From his capital Shiraz, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ruled \"an island of relative calm and peace in an otherwise bloody and destructive period,\" however the extent of Zand power was confined to contemporary Iran and parts of the Caucasus. Karim Khan's death in 1779 led to yet another civil war in which the Qajar dynasty eventually triumphed and became kings of Iran. During the civil war, Iran permanently lost Basra in 1779 to the Ottomans, which had been captured during the Ottoman\u2013Persian War (1775\u201376), and Bahrain to Al Khalifa family after Bani Utbah invasion in 1783.\nLate modern period.\nQajar dynasty (1796\u20131925).\nAgha Mohammad Khan emerged victorious out of the civil war that commenced with the death of the last Zand king. His reign is noted for the reemergence of a centrally led and united Iran. After the death of Nader Shah and the last of the Zands, most of Iran's Caucasian territories had broken away into various Caucasian khanates. Agha Mohammad Khan, like the Safavid kings and Nader Shah before him, viewed the region as no different from the territories in mainland Iran. Therefore, his first objective after having secured mainland Iran, was to reincorpate the Caucasus region into Iran. Georgia was seen as one of the most integral territories. For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule. As the \"Cambridge History of Iran\" states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan. It was therefore natural for Agha Mohammad Khan to perform whatever necessary means in the Caucasus in order to subdue and reincorporate the recently lost regions following Nader Shah's death and the demise of the Zands, including putting down what in Iranian eyes was seen as treason on the part Erekle II.\nAgha Mohammad Khan subsequently demanded that Erekle renounce its 1783 treaty with Russia, and to submit again to Iranian suzerainty, in return for peace and the security of his kingdom. The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized the latter's rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries. Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone. Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum. As a response, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded the Caucasus region after crossing the Aras river, and, while on his way to Georgia, he re-subjugated Iran's territories of the Erivan Khanate, Shirvan, Nakhchivan Khanate, Ganja khanate, Derbent Khanate, Baku khanate, Talysh Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, which comprise modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Igdir. Having reached Georgia with his large army, he prevailed in the Battle of Krtsanisi, which resulted in the capture and sack of Tbilisi, as well as the effective resubjugation of Georgia. Upon his return from his successful campaign in Tbilisi and in effective control over Georgia, together with some 15,000 Georgian captives that were moved back to mainland Iran, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just as his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier. Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated in 1797 while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in Shusha (now part of the Republic of Azerbaijan) and its King Heraclius II.\nThe reassertion of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi. The Russians were already actively occupied with an expansionist policy towards its neighboring empires to its south, namely the Ottoman Empire and the successive Iranian kingdoms, since the late 17th/early 18th century. The next two years following Russia's entrance into Tbilisi were a time of confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801. As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had been an integral part of Iran for centuries, this would lead directly to the wars of several years later, namely the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804-1813 and 1826\u20131828. The outcome of these two wars (in the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay, respectively) proved for the irrevocable forced cession and loss of what is now eastern Georgia, Dagestan, Armenia, and Azerbaijan to Imperial Russia.\nThe area to the north of the river Aras, among which the territory of the contemporary republic of Azerbaijan, eastern Georgia, Dagestan, and Armenia were Iranian territory until they were occupied by Russia in the course of the 19th century.\nMigration of Caucasian Muslims.\nFollowing the official loss of vast territories in the Caucasus, major demographic shifts were bound to take place. Following the 1804\u20131814 war, but also per the 1826\u20131828 war which ceded the last territories, large migrations of so-called Caucasian Muhajirs set off for mainland Iran. Some of these groups included the Ayrums, Qarapapaqs, Circassians, Shia Lezgins, and other Transcaucasian Muslims.\nAfter the Battle of Ganja of 1804, many thousands of Ayrums and Qarapapaqs were settled in Tabriz. During the remaining part of the 1804\u20131813 war, as well as through the 1826\u20131828 war, a large number of the Ayrums and Qarapapaqs that were still remaining in newly conquered Russian territories were settled in and migrated to Solduz (in modern-day Iran's West Azerbaijan province). As the \"Cambridge History of Iran\" states; \"The steady encroachment of Russian troops along the frontier in the Caucasus, General Yermolov's brutal punitive expeditions and misgovernment, drove large numbers of Muslims, and even some Georgian Christians, into exile in Iran.\"\nFrom 1864 until the early 20th century, another mass expulsion took place of Caucasian Muslims as a result of the Russian victory in the Caucasian War. Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus departed for Turkey or Iran. These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks.\nMany of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade, which was established in the late 19th century. The initial ranks of the brigade would be entirely composed of Circassians and other Caucasian Muhajirs. This brigade would prove decisive in the following decades in Qajar history.\nFurthermore, the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay included the official rights for the Russian Empire to encourage settling of Armenians from Iran in the newly conquered Russian territories. Until the mid-fourteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in Eastern Armenia. \nAt the close of the fourteenth century, after Timur's campaigns, the Timurid Renaissance flourished, and Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia. After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere. Following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604\u201305, their numbers dwindled even further.\nAt the time of the Russian invasion of Iran, some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%. As a result of the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and the Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828), Iran was forced to cede Iranian Armenia (which also constituted the present-day Armenia), to the Russians. After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia. The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and Ottoman Turkey. As a result, by 1832, the number of ethnic Armenians had matched that of the Muslims. It would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia. Nevertheless, the city of Erivan retained a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century. According to the traveller H. F. B. Lynch, the city of Erivan was about 50% Armenian and 50% Muslim (Tatars i.e. Azeris and Persians) in the early 1890s.\nFath Ali Shah's reign saw increased diplomatic contacts with the West and the beginning of intense European diplomatic rivalries over Iran. His grandson Mohammad Shah, who succeeded him in 1834, fell under the Russian influence and made two unsuccessful attempts to capture Herat. When Mohammad Shah died in 1848 the succession passed to his son Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, who proved to be the ablest and most successful of the Qajar sovereigns. He founded the first modern hospital in Iran.\nConstitutional Revolution and deposition.\nThe Great Persian Famine of 1870\u20131871 is believed to have caused the death of two million people.\nA new era in the history of Iran dawned with the Persian Constitutional Revolution against the shah in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy). The first Majlis (parliament) was convened on 7 October 1906. The discovery of petroleum in 1908 by the British in Khuzestan spawned intense renewed interest in Persia by the British Empire (see William Knox D'Arcy and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, now BP). Britain's influence was solidified by the establishment of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in the 1860s and the Imperial Bank of Persia in 1889. By the end of the 19th century, European interference became so pronounced that Iran's central government required Anglo-Russian approval for ministerial appointments. Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as The Great Game, and codified in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which divided Iran into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty.\nDuring World War I, the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see Persian Campaign). In 1919, after the Russian Revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Iran, which was unsuccessful. The Constitutionalist movement of Gilan and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, later Reza Shah Pahlavi, who established the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925. In 1921, Reza Khan, an officer of the Persian Cossack Brigade, (along with Seyyed Zia'eddin Tabatabai) led a military led a coup against governing officials (leaving the Qajar monarchy nominally head of state). In 1925, after being prime minister for two years, Reza Khan did depose the Qajar dynasty and became the first shah of the Pahlavi dynasty.\nPahlavi era (1925\u20131979).\nReza Shah (1925\u20131941).\nReza Shah ruled for almost 16 years until 16 September 1941, when he was forced to abdicate by the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran. He established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism, militarism, secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda. Reza Shah introduced many socio-economic reforms, reorganizing the army, government administration, and finances. To his supporters, his reign brought \"law and order, discipline, central authority, and modern amenities \u2013 schools, trains, buses, radios, cinemas, and telephones\". However, his attempts of modernisation have been criticised for being \"too fast\" and \"superficial\", and his reign a time of \"oppression, corruption, taxation, lack of authenticity\" with \"security typical of police states.\"\nMany of the new laws and regulations created resentment among devout Muslims and the clergy. For example, mosques were required to use chairs; most men were required to wear western clothing, including a hat with a brim; women were encouraged to discard the hijab\u2014hijab was eventually banned in 1936; men and women were allowed to congregate freely, violating Islamic mixing of the sexes. Tensions boiled over in 1935, when bazaaris and villagers rose up in rebellion at the Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad to protest against plans for the hijab ban, chanting slogans such as 'The Shah is a new Yezid.' Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured when troops finally quelled the unrest.\nWorld War II.\nWhile German armies were highly successful against the Soviet Union, the Iranian government expected Germany to win the war and establish a powerful force on its borders. It rejected British and Soviet demands to expel German residents from Iran. In response, the two Allies invaded in August 1941 and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in \"Operation Countenance\". Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see \"Persian Corridor\"). Iran remained officially neutral. Its monarch Rez\u0101 Sh\u0101h was deposed during the subsequent occupation and replaced with his young son Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.\nAt the Tehran Conference of 1943, the Allies issued the Tehran Declaration which guaranteed the post-war independence and boundaries of Iran. However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, the Azerbaijan People's Government and the Republic of Kurdistan respectively, in late 1945. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions. The Soviet republics in the north were soon overthrown and the oil concessions were revoked.\nMohammad-Reza Shah (1941\u20131979).\nInitially there were hopes that post-occupation Iran could become a constitutional monarchy. The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power. Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption. Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers. Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran\u2014a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being. The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended.\nIn 1951 Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq received the vote required from the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the Abadan Crisis. Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued. Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the Shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier, and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri.\n1953: U.S. aided coup removes Mosaddeq.\nShortly thereafter on 19 August a successful coup was headed by retired army general Fazlollah Zahedi, aided by the United States (CIA) with the active support of the British (MI6) (known as Operation Ajax and Operation Boot to the respective agencies). The coup\u2014with a black propaganda campaign designed to turn the population against Mosaddeq \u2014 forced Mosaddeq from office. Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason. Found guilty, his sentence was reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed. Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the National Front and Communist Tudeh Party.\nIran was ruled as an autocracy under the Shah with American support from that time until the revolution. The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years, splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors. In 1957 martial law was ended after 16 years and Iran became closer to the West, joining the Baghdad Pact and receiving military and economic aid from the US. In 1961, Iran initiated a series of economic, social, agrarian and administrative reforms to modernize the country that became known as the Shah's White Revolution.\nThe core of this program was land reform. Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world. However, the reforms, including the White Revolution, did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain Islamic religious and political groups. In early June 1963 several days of massive rioting occurred in support of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini following the cleric's arrest for a speech attacking the Shah.\nTwo years later, premier Hassan Ali Mansur was assassinated and the internal security service, SAVAK, became more violently active. In the 1970s, leftist guerilla groups such as Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK), emerged and contributed to overthrowing the Shah during the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nNearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured. The Islamic clergy, headed by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini (who had been exiled in 1964), were becoming increasingly vociferous.\nIran greatly increased its defense budget and by the early 1970s was the region's strongest military power. Bilateral relations with Iraq were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway. In November 1971, Iranian forces seized control of three islands at the mouth of the Persian Gulf; in response, Iraq expelled thousands of Iranian nationals. Following a number of clashes in April 1969, Iran abrogated the 1937 accord and demanded a renegotiation.\nIn mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control. Following the Arab-Israeli War of October 1973, Iran did not join the Arab oil embargo against the West and Israel. Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernisation and to increase defense spending.\nA border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the Algiers Accord on 6 March 1975.\nContemporary period.\nRevolution and the Islamic Republic (1979 to present).\nThe Iranian Revolution, also known as the Islamic Revolution, was the revolution that transformed Iran from an absolute monarchy under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to an Islamic republic under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, one of the leaders of the revolution and founder of the Islamic Republic. Its time span can be said to have begun in January 1978 with the first major demonstrations, and concluded with the approval of the new theocratic Constitution\u2014whereby Ayatollah Khomeini became Supreme Leader of the country\u2014in December 1979.\nIn between, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi left the country for exile in January 1979 after strikes and demonstrations paralyzed the country, and on 1 February 1979, Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Tehran. The final collapse of the Pahlavi dynasty occurred shortly after on 11 February when Iran's military declared itself \"neutral\" after guerrillas and rebel troops overwhelmed troops loyal to the Shah in armed street fighting. Iran officially became an Islamic Republic on 1 April 1979, after Iranians overwhelmingly approved a national referendum to make it so a day before.\nIdeology of the 1979 Iranian Revolution.\nThe ideology of the revolutionary government was populist, nationalist and most of all Shi'a Islamic. Its unique constitution is based on the concept of \"velayat-e faqih\" the idea advanced by Khomeini that Muslims \u2013 in fact everyone \u2013 requires \"guardianship\", in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists. Khomeini served as this ruling jurist, or supreme leader, until his death in 1989.\nIran's rapidly modernising, capitalist economy was replaced by populist and Islamic economic and cultural policies. Much industry was nationalized, laws and schools Islamicized, and Western influences banned.\nThe Islamic revolution also created great impact around the world. In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam, along with \"fear and distrust towards Islam\" and particularly the Islamic Republic and its founder.\nKhomeini (1979\u20131989).\nKhomeini served as leader of the revolution or as Supreme Leader of Iran from 1979 to his death on 3 June 1989. This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a theocratic republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody war with Iraq.\nThe consolidation lasted until 1982\u20133, as Iran coped with the damage to its economy, military, and apparatus of government, and protests and uprisings by secularists, leftists, and more traditional Muslims\u2014formerly ally revolutionaries but now rivals\u2014were effectively suppressed. Many political opponents were executed by the new regimes. Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in regions comprising Khuzistan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, resulting in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces. These revolts began in April 1979 and lasted between several months to over a year, depending on the region. The Kurdish uprising, led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties.\nIn the summer of 1979 a new constitution giving Khomeini a powerful post as guardian jurist Supreme Leader and a clerical Council of Guardians power over legislation and elections, was drawn up by an Assembly of Experts for Constitution. The new constitution was approved by referendum in December 1979.\nIran hostage crisis (1979\u20131981).\nAn early event in the history of the Islamic republic that had a long-term impact was the Iran hostage crisis. Following the admitting of the former Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment, on 4 November 1979, Iranian students seized US embassy personnel, labeling the embassy a \"den of spies.\" Fifty-two hostages were held for 444 days until January 1981. An American military attempt to rescue the hostages failed.\nThe takeover was enormously popular in Iran, where thousands gathered in support of the hostage takers, and it is thought to have strengthened the prestige of the Ayatollah Khomeini and consolidated the hold of anti-Americanism. It was at this time that Khomeini began referring to America as the \"Great Satan.\" In America, where it was considered a violation of the long-standing principle of international law that diplomats may be expelled but not held captive, it created a powerful anti-Iranian backlash. Relations between the two countries have remained deeply antagonistic and American international sanctions have hurt Iran's economy.\nIran\u2013Iraq War (1980\u20131988).\nDuring this political and social crisis, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein attempted to take advantage of the disorder of the Revolution, the weakness of the Iranian military and the revolution's antagonism with Western governments. The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East. He sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule.\nOf chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well. On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates, the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well. With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days. On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army invaded Iran at Khuzestan, precipitating the Iran\u2013Iraq War. The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise.\nAlthough Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982. Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country. The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, \"drank the cup of poison\" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations.\nTens of thousands of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed when Iraq used chemical weapons in its warfare. Iraq was financially backed by Egypt, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China (which also sold weapons to Iran).\nThere were more than 182,000 Kurdish victims of Iraq's chemical weapons during the eight-year war. The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000. Almost all relevant international agencies have confirmed that Saddam engaged in chemical warfare to blunt Iranian human wave attacks; these agencies unanimously confirmed that Iran never used chemical weapons during the war.\nStarting on 19 July 1988 and lasting for about five months the government systematically executed thousands of political prisoners across Iran. This is commonly referred to as the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners or the 1988 Iranian Massacre. The main target was the membership of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party). Estimates of the number executed vary from 1,400 to 30,000.\nKhamenei (1989\u2013present).\nOn his deathbed in 1989, Khomeini appointed a 25-man Constitutional Reform Council which named then president Ali Khamenei as the next Supreme Leader, and made a number of changes to Iran's constitution. A smooth transition followed Khomeini's death on 3 June 1989. While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's \"charisma and clerical standing\", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations. Under his reign Iran's regime is said \u2013 by at least one observer \u2013 to resemble more \"a clerical oligarchy ... than an autocracy.\"\nRafsanjani: pragmatic conservativism (1989\u20131997).\nAli-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani succeeded Khamenei as president on 3 August 1989, as a pragmatic conservative who served two four-year terms and focused his efforts on rebuilding the country's economy and infrastructure damaged by war, though hampered by low oil prices. Rafsanjani sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy. The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation. This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states. During the Persian Gulf War in 1991 the country remained neutral, restricting its action to the condemnation of the U.S. and allowing fleeing Iraqi aircraft and refugees into the country.\nIran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades. This admiration had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government. The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama's ability to gain further control of the state. In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power. However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary.\nKhatami: reformers and conservatives struggle (1997\u20132005).\nPresident Rafsanjani's economic policies led to stronger relations with the outside world. But his government's relaxation of the enforcement of certain regulations on social behavior were met with some responses of widespread disenchantment among the general population with the ulama as rulers of the country. This led to the defeat of the government's candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist. He was beaten by an independent candidate from the Reformists, Mohammad Khatami. He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth. The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic. Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy. This rift reached a climax in July 1999 when massive anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Tehran. The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.\nDuring his first term, President Khatami oversaw Iran\u2019s second five-year development plan and introduced a new plan for 2000\u20132004 focused on economic reconstruction alongside social and political reforms. The plan aimed for privatization, job creation, and reduced subsidies but fell short on employment targets. Despite this, Iran saw improved economic indicators: real GDP growth rose to nearly 6 percent, unemployment and inflation declined, external debt dropped significantly, and the government authorized private banks for the first time since 1979. Poverty levels also decreased modestly.\nIn the Majlis elections of 2000, for the first time liberals and Khatami\u2019s supporters gained parliamentary control from conservatives. That same year, following the adoption of a new press law, authorities banned the publication of 16 reformist newspapers.\nKhatami was re-elected in June 2001 but his efforts were repeatedly blocked by the conservatives in the parliament. Conservative elements within Iran's government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections. This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran's youth.\nFollowing the September 11 attacks in 2001, Iran initially was sympathetic with the United States. However, relations deteriorated sharply after President George W. Bush labeled Iran part of the \"Axis of Evil\" in 2002, accusing the country of pursuing weapons of mass destruction that posed a threat to the U.S.\nDespite firm U.S. opposition, in 2002 Russian teams commenced work on Iran\u2019s inaugural nuclear reactor at Bushehr.\nIn June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran. Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer and human rights advocate, became the first Iranian to win the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. She had been the country's first female judge until being forced to step down after the 1979 revolution. The response to the award in Iran was mixed\u2014enthusiastic supporters greeted her at the airport upon her return, the conservative media underplayed it, and Khatami criticized it as political.\nA violent earthquake struck the Kerman province of southeastern Iran in December 2003. The earthquake was particularly destructive in Bam, with the death toll amounting to at least 34,000 people and injuring up to 200,000.\nAfter the hardline Council of Guardians disqualified thousands of reformist candidates, conservatives regained control of parliament in the elections of 2004.\nAhmadinejad: hardline conservatism (2005\u20132013).\nIn the 2005 Iranian presidential election, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, mayor of Tehran, became the sixth president of Iran, after winning 62 percent of the vote in the run-off poll, against former president Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. During the authorization ceremony he kissed Khamenei's hand in demonstration of his loyalty to him.\nDuring this time, the American invasion of Iraq, the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime and empowerment of its Shi'a majority, all strengthened Iran's position in the region particularly in the mainly Shi'a south of Iraq, where a top Shia leader in the week of 3 September 2006 renewed demands for an autonomous Shi'a region. At least one commentator (former U.S. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen) has stated that as of 2009 Iran's growing power has eclipsed anti-Zionism as the major foreign policy issue in the Middle East.\nDuring 2005 and 2006, there were claims that the United States and Israel were planning to attack Iran, with the most cited reason being Iran's civilian nuclear energy program which the United States and some other states fear could lead to a nuclear weapons program. China and Russia opposed military action of any sort and opposed economic sanctions. Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons. The fatwa was cited in an official statement by the Iranian government at an August 2005 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. However, The IAEA reported in 2008 that Iran\u2019s suspected nuclear weapons research remained \u201ca matter of serious concern,\u201d prompting European Union countries to agree on new sanctions. Additional U.N. sanctions followed in 2010. In 2011, Iran announced that the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant had been connected to the national electricity grid for the first time. Eventually, the sanctions severely impacted Iran\u2019s economy, contributing to a dramatic depreciation of the rial, which reportedly fell to a record low of 35,000 to the US dollar\u2014an 80% drop since late 2011.\nIn 2007, a diplomatic standoff erupted between Iran and the UK after Iranian forces detained 15 British sailors and marines near the Shatt al-Arab waterway, which forms part of the Iran-Iraq border.\nIn 2009, Ahmadinejad's reelection was hotly disputed and marred by large protests that formed the \"greatest domestic challenge\" to the leadership of the Islamic Republic \"in 30 years\". The resulting social unrest is widely known as the Iranian Green Movement. Reformist opponent Mir-Hossein Mousavi and his supporters alleged voting irregularities and by 1 July 2009, 1000 people had been arrested and 20 killed in street demonstrations. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other Islamic officials blamed foreign powers for fomenting the protest.\nIn 2010, Stuxnet was reportedly found in the Natanz Nuclear Facility. Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm thought to have been in development since at least 2005. Stuxnet targets supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to the Iran nuclear program. Although neither the United States nor Israel has openly admitted responsibility, multiple independent news organizations claim Stuxnet to be a cyberweapon built jointly by the two countries in a collaborative effort known as Operation Olympic Games. The program, started during the Bush administration, was rapidly expanded within the first months of Barack Obama's presidency.\nOn 14 February 2011, widespread protests erupted in Tehran as thousands gathered in response to opposition calls, expressing solidarity with pro-democracy movements in the region and reviving dissent over the contested 2009 presidential election. Security forces quickly suppressed the demonstrations, resulting in two deaths and numerous injuries. Further protests followed, including on 20 February and 1 March, when the opposition reported around 200 arrests. Authorities subsequently managed to prevent large-scale demonstrations.\nReports of growing tensions between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei emerged during this period. In the 2012 parliamentary elections, Ahmadinejad\u2019s allies lost ground to factions loyal to Khamenei, while the opposition Green Movement remained banned. Its leaders, Mehdi Karroubi and Mir-Hossein Mousavi, were placed under house arrest in early 2011 and have remained out of public view, with some government supporters demanding their execution.\nRouhani: pragmatism (2013\u20132021).\nOn 15 June 2013, Hassan Rouhani won the presidential election in Iran, with a total number of 36,704,156 ballots cast; Rouhani won 18,613,329 votes. In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world.\nOn 14 July 2015, after years of negotiations, Iran and the P5+1 group of world powers (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States, plus Germany) together with the European Union finalized the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran nuclear deal. The agreement aimed to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for relief from international sanctions. It followed the 2013 Joint Plan of Action, an interim deal that opened formal negotiations. By April 2015, negotiators had agreed on a framework that set the stage for the final accord in Vienna.\nUnder the JCPOA, Iran agreed to significant restrictions on its nuclear activities, including limits on uranium enrichment levels, the number and type of operating centrifuges, and the size of its enriched uranium stockpile. Key facilities at Fordow, Natanz, and Arak were to be repurposed for civilian research and medical uses. Iran also accepted more intrusive inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify compliance. In return, it received relief from nuclear-related sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the European Union, and the United States, although many other U.S. sanctions remained in place, especially those targeting Iran\u2019s missile program and regional activities.\nBeginning on 28 December 2017, protests known as the Dey protests spread across Iran, starting over economic grievances in Mashhad but quickly expanding to political opposition to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and the theocratic system. Marking the most serious unrest since 2009, the largely leaderless protests featured anti-regime chants and attacks on government sites, with at least twenty-one protesters and two security personnel killed, and around 3,700 arrested by early January 2018. In response, thousands of government supporters held pro-government rallies in multiple cities.\nIn May 2018, Donald Trump decided to pull out of the JCPOA, announcing he would reimpose economic sanctions on Iran effective from 4 November that year. This marked the beginning of the Trump administration's maximum pressure campaign, an effort to force Iran to renegotiate the nuclear agreement by imposing intensified sanctions.\nOn 22 September 2018, the Ahvaz military parade was attacked by gunmen in the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz. The shooters killed 25 people, including soldiers of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and civilian bystanders. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. Iran blamed \"militants in Syria\" and claimed the \"U.S. and the Gulf states enabled the attack\" and vowed revenge. The U.S., Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates rejected the accusation.\nFrom mid-March to April 2019 widespread flash flooding affected large parts of Iran, most severely in Golestan, Fars, Khuzestan, Lorestan, and other provinces. Iran was hit by three major waves of rain and flooding over the course of two weeks which led to flooding in at least 26 of Iran's 31 provinces. At least 70 people died nationwide.\nThe 2019\u20132020 Iranian protests began in response to a 50\u2013200% fuel price increase and quickly spread to 21 cities, becoming the most violent unrest since the 1979 revolution. Security forces reportedly shot protesters from rooftops, helicopters, and at close range, killing around 1,500 people according to U.S. sources, while Amnesty International described efforts to cover up the scale of the violence. Protesters attacked 731 banks, 50 military bases, and nine religious centers, prompting the government to impose a near-total internet blackout for six days. The uprising was crushed within three days, though sporadic protests continued.\nOn 3 January 2020, the United States military executed a drone strike at Baghdad Airport, killing Qasem Soleimani, the leader of the Quds Force, an elite branch of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The assassination sharply increased tensions between the two countries. Iran vowed retaliation, and on 8 January launched missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq, marking the first direct military exchange between Iran and the U.S. since 1988. The same day, the IRGC mistakenly shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. Following these events, no further military escalation occurred.\nThe 2020 parliamentary elections in Iran were marked by historically low voter turnout, officially reported at 42.6%\u2014the lowest since the 1979 revolution. The elections took place in the wake of widespread public disillusionment following the violent crackdown on protests in late 2019, which severely damaged the credibility of President Hassan Rouhani and the reformist camp. As a result, conservative candidates won a dominant majority in the parliament, securing 221 out of 290 seats, while reformists managed to win only a small fraction. The outcome was widely seen as a significant blow to Rouhani ahead of the end of his term in 2021.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Iran led to unknown confirmed cases of COVID-19 and unknown deaths. The first cases were reported in Qom on 19 February 2020. The government responded by cancelling public events, closing institutions and shrines, and requesting a $5 billion emergency loan from the IMF. Initial resistance to quarantines and travel restrictions contributed to the virus\u2019s spread before a ban on intercity travel was implemented. After restrictions eased in April, cases surged again, peaking in June and July. Despite these rising case numbers, the government had no option but to keep the economy open, as it was already under strain from U.S. sanctions and had suffered a further 15% GDP decline due to the pandemic by June 2020. Estimates of deaths have varied widely, with some leaked data suggesting a much higher toll than official figures, and the government faced allegations of mismanagement and censorship. The virus also impacted Iran\u2019s leadership, infecting 23 MPs by early March and killing at least 17 officials by late March.\nEbrahim Raisi (2021\u20132024).\nOn 3 August 2021 Ebrahim Raisi was elected 8th President of Iran.\nOn 16 September 2022, 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in a hospital in Tehran, Iran, under suspicious circumstances. The Guidance Patrol, the religious morality police of Iran's government, had arrested Amini for allegedly not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards. The Law Enforcement Command of the Islamic Republic of Iran stated that she had a heart attack at a police station, collapsed, and fell into a coma before being transferred to a hospital. However, eyewitnesses reported that she was severely beaten and that she died as a result of police brutality, which was denied by the Iranian authorities. Amini's death resulted in a series of protests described as more widespread and larger than previous large protests. Iran Human Rights reported that by December 2022 at least 476 people had been killed by security forces attacking protests across the country. By spring 2023, the protests had largely subsided, ultimately leaving the political leadership unchanged and firmly entrenched in power.\nIn October 2023, an IAEA report estimated Iran had increased its uranium stockpile 22 times over the 2015 agreed JCPOA limit.\nOn 1 April 2024, Israel's air strike on an Iranian consulate building in the Syrian capital Damascus killed an important senior commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), Brig Gen Mohammad Reza Zahedi. In retaliation for the Israeli strike, Iran attacked Israel with over 300 drones and missiles on 13 April. However, the Iranian attack was mainly intercepted either outside Israeli airspace or over the country itself. It was the biggest missile attack in Iranian history, and its first ever direct attack on Israel. It was followed by a retaliatory missile strike by Israel on Isfahan, Iran on 19 April.\nOn 19 May 2024, Ebrahim Raisi died in a helicopter crash in the country\u2019s East Azerbaijan province. First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber was appointed acting president after the death of President Raisi.\nMasoud Pezeshkian (2024\u2013present).\nOn 28 July 2024, Masoud Pezeshkian was formally endorsed as Iran's new president by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Pezeshkian, a reformist, won in a presidential election runoff on 5 July. Three days later, Ismail Haniyeh, political chief of Palestinian political and military organisation Hamas, was assassinated in Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, where he was to attend the inauguration ceremony of Iran\u2019s President Masoud Pezeshkian.\nOn 1 October 2024, Iran launched about 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for assassinations of Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and Abbas Nilforoushan. On 27 October, Israel responded to that attack by strikes on a missile defence system in the Iranian region of Isfahan.\nIn December 2024, the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, a close ally of Iran, was a severe setback for the political influence of Iran in the region.\nIn early 2025, Iran was enriching substantial quantities of uranium to 60% purity, close to weapons-grade. Analysts warned that such activity exceeded any plausible civilian justification. Beginning in April 2025, Iran and the United States entered negotiations for a new nuclear agreement, but progress stalled as Iran's leaders have refused to stop enriching uranium. Among the main points of disagreement were the conditions for lifting sanctions against Iran. In June 2025, IAEA found Iran non-compliant with its nuclear obligations for the first time in two decades. In response, Iran announced the activation of a new enrichment facility and began installing additional advanced centrifuges.\nOn 13 June 2025, Israel launched coordinated strikes across Iran, targeting nuclear facilities and eliminating top members of Iran's military leadership. Iran retaliated with waves of missile and drone strikes against Israeli cities and military sites. On 22 June, also the US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites. On 24 June, Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire after insistence from the US.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64214", "revid": "39152912", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64214", "title": "History of Catalonia", "text": "The recorded history of the lands of what today is known as Catalonia begins with the development of the Iberian peoples while several Greek colonies were established on the coast before the Roman conquest. It was the first area of Hispania conquered by the Romans. It then came under Visigothic rule after the collapse of the western part of the Roman Empire. In 718, the area was occupied by the Umayyad Caliphate and became a part of Muslim ruled al-Andalus. The Frankish Empire conquered northern half of the area from the Muslims, ending with the conquest of Barcelona in 801, as part of the creation of a larger buffer zone of Christian counties against Islamic rule historiographically known as the \"Marca Hispanica\". In the 10th century the County of Barcelona became progressively independent from Frankish rule.\nIn 1137, Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona betrothed the heiress of the Kingdom of Aragon, Petronilla, establishing the dynastic union of the County of Barcelona with Aragon, resulting in a composite monarchy later known as Crown of Aragon, while the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties merged into a state, the Principality of Catalonia, which developed an institutional system (Catalan Courts, constitutions, Generalitat) that limited the power of the kings. Catalonia sponsored and contributed to the expansion of the Crown's trade and military, most significantly their navy. The Catalan language flourished and expanded as more territories were added to the Crown of Aragon, including Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, Sicily, Naples, and Athens. The Crisis of the Late Middle Ages, the end of the reign of House of Barcelona, serf and urban conflicts and a civil war (1462\u20131472) weakened the role of the Principality within the Crown and internationally.\nIn 1516, Charles V became monarch of both the crowns of Aragon and Castile, creating a personal union in which every state kept their own laws, jurisdiction, institutions, borders and currency. In 1492 the Spanish colonization of the Americas began, political power began to shift away towards Castile. Tensions between Catalan institutions and the Monarchy, alongside the economic crisis and the peasants' revolts, caused the Reapers' War (1640\u20131652), in which a Catalan Republic was briefly established. By the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), the northern parts of Catalonia, mostly the Roussillon, were ceded to France. The status of separate state of the Principality of Catalonia came to an end after the War of Spanish Succession (1701\u20131714), in which the Crown of Aragon supported the claim of the Archduke Charles of Habsburg. Following Catalan capitulation on 11 September 1714, the king Philip V of Bourbon, inspired by the model of France imposed a unifying administration across Spain, enacting the Nueva Planta decrees, which suppressed Catalan political institutions and public law, and merged it into Castile as a province. These led to the eclipse of Catalan as a language of government and literature. During the second half of the 17th and the 18th centuries Catalonia experienced economic growth, reinforced in the late 18th century when C\u00e1diz's trade monopoly with American colonies ended.\nIn the 19th century Catalonia was severely affected by the Napoleonic and Carlist Wars. The Napoleonic occupation and subsequent war in Spain began a period of political and economic turmoil. In the second third of the century, Catalonia became a center of industrialization. As wealth from the industrial expansion grew, Catalonia saw a cultural renaissance coupled with incipient nationalism while several workers movements (particularly anarchism) appeared.\nIn the 20th century, Catalonia enjoyed and lost varying degrees of autonomy. The Second Spanish Republic (1931\u20131939) established Catalan self-government and the official use of the Catalan language. Like much of Spain, Catalonia (which, in turn, expererienced a revolutionary process) fought to defend the Republic in the Civil War of 1936\u20131939. The Republican defeat established the dictatorship of Francisco Franco, which unleashed a harsh repression and suppressed the autonomy. With Spain devastated and cut off from international trade and the autarkic politics of the regime, Catalonia, as an industrial center, suffered severely; the economic recovery was slow. Between 1959 and 1974 Spain experienced the second-fastest economic expansion in the world known as the Spanish Miracle, and Catalonia prospered as Spain's most important industrial and tourist area. In 1975 Franco died, bringing his regime to an end, and the new democratic Spanish constitution of 1978 recognised Catalonia's autonomy and language. It regained considerable self-government in internal affairs and today remains one of the most economically dynamic communities of Spain. Since the 2010s there have been growing calls for Catalan independence.\nPrehistory.\nThe first known human settlements in what is now Catalonia were at the beginning of the Middle Palaeolithic. The oldest known trace of human occupation is a mandible found in Banyoles, described by some sources as pre-Neanderthal some 200,000 years old; other sources suggest it to be only about one third that old. Some of the most important prehistoric remains were found in the caves of Mollet (Seriny\u00e0, Pla de l'Estany), the Cau del Duc in the Montgr\u00ed mountain (\"cau\" meaning \"cave\" or \"lair\"), the remains at Forn d'en Sugranyes (Reus) and the shelters Roman\u00ed and Agut (Capellades), while those of the Upper Paleolithic are found at Reclau Viver, the cave of Arbreda and la Bora Gran d'en Carreres, in Seriny\u00e0, or the Cau de les Goges, in Sant Juli\u00e0 de Ramis. From the next prehistoric era, the Epipaleolithic or Mesolithic, important remains survive, the greater part dated between 8000 BC and 5000 BC, such as those of Sant Gregori (Falset) and el Filador (Margalef de Montsant).\nThe Neolithic era began in Catalonia around 4500 BC, although the population was slower to develop fixed settlements than in other places, thanks to the abundance of woods, which allowed the continuation of a fundamentally hunter-gatherer culture. The most important Neolithic remains in Catalonia are the Cave of Fontmajor (l'Espluga de Francol\u00ed), The Cave of Toll (Mor\u00e0), the caves Gran and Freda (Montserrat), the shelters of Cogul and Ulldecona, or La Draga, an early Neolithic village which dates from the end of the 6th millennium BC.\nThe \"Chalcolithic\" or Eneolithic period developed in Catalonia between 2500 and 1800 BC, with the beginning of the construction of copper objects. The Bronze Age occurred between 1800 and 700 BC. There are few remnants of this era, but there were some known settlements in the low Segre zone. The Bronze Age coincided with the arrival of the Indo-Europeans through the Urnfield Culture, whose successive waves of migration began around 1200 BC, and they were responsible for the creation of the first proto-urban settlements. Around the middle of the 7th century BC, the Iron Age arrived in Catalonia.\nAncient history.\nRise of the Iberian culture.\nAn iron-using culture first appeared in eastern Iberia in the 8th century BC. By the 5th century BC, the Iron Age Iberian civilization had become consolidated on the eastern side of the Iberian Peninsula. What is now the Catalan territory was home to several distinct tribes of Iberians: the Indigetes in Empord\u00e0, the Ceretani in Cerdanya and the Airenosins in the Val d'Aran. Some urban agglomerations became relevant, including Ilerda (Lleida) inland, Hibera (perhaps Amposta or Tortosa) or Indika (Ullastret). The settlement of Castellet de Banyoles in Tivissa was one of the most important ancient Iberian settlements. This, situated in the northeast of the peninsula, was discovered in 1912. Also, the 'Treasure of Tivissa', a unique collection of silver Iberian votive offerings was found here in 1927.\nIberian society was divided into different classes, including kings or chieftains, nobles, priests, artisans and slaves. Iberian aristocracy, often called a \"senate\" by the ancient sources, met in a council of nobles. Kings or chieftains would maintain their forces through a system of obligation or vassalage that the Romans termed \"fides\".\nThe Iberians adopted wine and olives from the Greeks; Horse breeding was of particular importance to the Iberian nobility. Mining was a major contributor to the economy, from which fine metalwork and high-quality iron weapons could be produced.\nThe Iberian language was a Paleohispanic language. The oldest inscriptions are dated from the end of the 5th century BC, and the most recent of the end of the first century BC, even at the beginning of the 1st century AD, after being gradually replaced by Latin. In its different variants, the Iberian language was spoken in a broad coastal strip stretching from southern Languedoc to Alicante.\nGreeks arrived to the Iberian coasts by the late 7th century BC. The trading colony of Emp\u00faries (in Greek \"Emporion\", meaning \"market\", in Latin \"Emporiae\"), was founded on the northern coast of current Catalonia by the Greek city of Phocaea in the 6th century BC. Situated on the coastal commercial route between Massalia (Marseille) and Tartessos in the far south of Hispania, the city became a center of economic and commercial activity. Another known Greek colony was Rhode (Roses), located on the coast at the northern end of the Gulf of Roses.\nRoman times (200 B.C\u2013400 A.D).\nRomanization brought a second, distinct stage in the ancient history of Catalonia. Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus arrived in Emp\u00faries in 218 BC, with the objective of cutting off the sources of provisions of Hannibal's Carthaginian army during the Second Punic War. After the Carthaginian defeat, and the defeat of various Iberian tribes who rose up against Roman rule, 195 BC saw the effective completion of the Roman conquest of the territory that later became Catalonia. Romanization of the region began in earnest. The various tribes were absorbed into a common Roman culture and lost many distinct characteristics, including differences of language. Most local leaders were later admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.\nMost of what is now Catalonia first became part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior; after 27 BC, they became part of Tarraconensis, whose capital was Tarraco (now Tarragona). Other important cities of the Roman period are Ilerda (Lleida), Dertosa (Tortosa), Gerunda (Girona) as well as the ports of Empuri\u00e6 (former Emporion) and Barcino (Barcelona). As for the rest of Hispania, Latin law was granted to all cities under the reign of Vespasian (69-79 AD), while Roman citizenship was permitted to all free men of the Empire by the Edict of Caracalla in 212 AD (Tarraco, the capital, was already a colony of Roman law since 45 BC). It was a rich agricultural province (olive oil, vine, wheat), and the first centuries of the Empire saw the construction of roads (the most important being the Via Augusta, parallel to Mediterranean coastline) and infrastructure like aqueducts.\nThe Crisis of the Third Century affected the whole Roman Empire, and gravely affected the Catalan territory, where there is evidence of significant levels of destruction and abandonment of Roman villas. This period also provides the first documentary evidence of the arrival of Christianity. Conversion to Christianity, attested in the 3rd century, was completed in urban areas in the 4th century. The first Christian communities in the \"Tarraconense\" were founded during the 3rd century, and the diocese of \"Tarraco\" was already established by 259, when the bishop Saint Fructuosus (Fructu\u00f3s) and the deacons Augurius and Eulogius were burned alive on the orders of the governor Aemilianus, under an edict issued by the emperor Valerian. Although Hispania remained under Roman rule and did not fall under the rule of Vandals, Swabians and Alans in the 5th century, the main cities suffered frequent sacking and some deurbanization. While archaeological evidence shows the recovery of some urban nuclei, such as Barcino (later Barcelona), Tarraco (later Tarragona), and Gerunda (later Girona), the previous situation was not restored: the cities became smaller, and constructed defensive walls.\nFrom late antiquity to feudalism (400\u20131100).\nVisigothic and Muslim rule.\nIn the 5th century, as part of the invasion of the Roman Empire by Germanic tribes, the Visigoths led by Athaulf, installed themselves in the Tarraconensis (Ebro basin, 410) and when in 475 the Visigothic king Euric formed the kingdom of Tolosa (modern Toulouse), he incorporated the territory equivalent to present-day Catalonia. Later, the Visigothic kingdom lost most of its territory north of the Pyrenees and shifted its capital to Toledo. The Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania lasted until the early 8th century. The Visigothic Kingdom respected and adopted the provincial system inherited from the Romans, the Tarraconense was maintained, but after the establishment of the new province of Cantabria its extension was reduced to the Valley of the Ebro and the current Catalonia. Beginning in 654, king Recceswinth ordered the promulgation of the \"Liber Iudiciorum\" (\"Book of the Judges\"), which was the first law code that applied equally to the Goths and to the Hispano-Roman population. This compilation will be in vigor in Catalan counties until the compilation of the Usages of Barcelona by count Ramon Berenguer I, largely based on the same \"Liber Iudiciorum\". Between 672 and 673, the eastern part of the Tarraconenis (modern Catalonia) and the province of Septimania rebelled against king Wamba, appointing dux Flavius Paulus as king in Narbonne. The rebellion was crushed by Wamba.\nIn 714, the Umayyad forces reached the northeastern part of the peninsula, where some important clashes took place (Zaragoza, possibly Barcelona). In 720, Narbonne fell to the joint Arab-Berber forces, followed by the conquest of what remained of the Visigothic kingdom, Septimania. The last Visigothic king Ardo died in battle in 721 and N\u00eemes was captured four years later.\nIn the time of the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba in the 10th century, the northern border stabilized against the Frankish-ruled counties along the Llobregat and Cardener rivers and the Montsec Range. Lleida and Tortosa, the two main cities of the Muslim ruled area of today's Catalonia (historiographically known as \"New Catalonia\"), formed the centers of defense. Many of the predominantly Christian inhabitants of these Muslim border regions converted to Islam. Especially the inhabitants of the valleys of Ebro, Segre, and Cinca as well as the plain of Lleida took over the way of life and achievements of the Muslims like the highly developed irrigation techniques. The most important Muslim cities in Catalonia were Lleida, Balaguer and Tortosa. They developed an old town (Medina) in North African style with mosque, administrative headquarters and court. They also had large markets (Suq) with workshops and homes of artisans. In some cities there were open places of worship (Musall\u0101) and \u2013 as in Tortosa \u2013 including a military fortress. Goods were exported via the port of Tortosa. Although there were peace treaties between the caliph in C\u00f3rdoba and some Catalan counts, the mutual attacks accumulated so, in 985 Almanzor, de facto ruler of the Caliphate, sacked Barcelona and captured thousands of its inhabitants.\nCarolingian conquest.\nAfter repelling Muslim incursions as far north as Tours in 732, the expanding Frankish Empire set about creating a buffer zone of Christian counties in the south that became historiographically known as the \"Marca Hispanica\" or Gothia. The first county to be conquered from the Moors was in Septimania which became Roussillon (including the Vallespir), following the conquest of Narbonne (759).\nIn 785 the County of Girona (with Besal\u00fa) on the south side of the Pyrenees was captured. Ribagor\u00e7a and Pallars were linked to Toulouse and were added to this county around 790. Urgell and Cerdanya were added in 798. The first records of the county of Emp\u00faries (with Perelada) are from 812, but the county was probably under Frankish control before 800. After a series of struggles, Charlemagne's son Louis took Barcelona from the Moorish emir in 801 and set up the County of Barcelona.\nThe counts of the Marca Hispanica had small outlying territories, each ruled by a lesser \"miles\" with armed retainers, who owed allegiance through the Count to the Carolingian Emperor and later to the kings of West Francia.\nAt the end of the 9th century, the Carolingian monarch Charles the Bald designated Wilfred the Hairy \u2013 a noble descendant of a family from Conflent and son of the earlier Count of Barcelona Sunifred I \u2013 as Count of Cerdanya and Urgell (870). After Charles's death (877), Wilfred became the Count of Barcelona and Girona (878) as well, bringing together the greater part of what was later to become Catalonia. On his death the counties were divided again among his sons, however, since then, the counties of Barcelona, Girona and Ausona (he repopulated the last one after a revolt) remained under the rule of the same person, becoming the core of the future Principality. Upon his death in 897 Wilfred, making their titles hereditaries founded the dynasty of the House of Barcelona, which ruled Catalonia until the death of Martin I, its last ruling member, in 1410.\nThe rise and fall of the \"aloers\".\nDuring the 10th century, the counts became increasingly independent of the weakening Carolingians. This was publicly acknowledged in 988 when the Count of Barcelona Borrell II declined to swear fealty to Hugh Capet, the first Capetian monarch of the emerging French kingdom. Borrell was motivated by Capet's failure to address Borrell's petitions to Capet for assistance against Muslim incursions. During this period, the population of the Catalan counties began to increase for the first time since the Muslim invasion. During the 9th and 10th centuries, the counties increasingly became a society of \"aloers\", peasant proprietors of small, family-based farms, who lived by subsistence agriculture and owed no formal feudal allegiance.\nThe 11th century was characterized by the development of feudal society, as the \"miles\" formed links of vassalage over this previously independent peasantry.\nThe middle years of the century were characterized by virulent class warfare. Seigniorial violence was unleashed against the peasants, utilizing new military tactics, based on contracting well-armed mercenary soldiers mounted on horses. By the end of the century, most of the \"aloers\" had been converted into vassals.\nThis coincided with a weakening of the power of the counts and the division of the Spanish Marches into more numerous counties, which gradually became a feudal state based on complex fealties and dependencies. During the regency of countess Ermesinde of Carcassonne the disintegration of central power was evident. From the time of the triumph of the grandson of Ermessinde, Ramon Berenguer I overlords and surrounding counts, the counts of Barcelona stood firmly as the link in a web of fealty between the counts and the Crown. Ramon Berenguer I began the codification of Catalan law in the written Usages of Barcelona which was to become the first full compilation of feudal law in Western Europe. Legal codification was part of the count's efforts to forward and somehow control the process of feudalization. The response of the Catholic Church to the feudal violence was the movement of Peace and Truce of God. The first assembly of Peace and Truce was presided by Abbot Oliba in Toulouges, Roussillon in 1027. The Peace and Truce assemblies promoted the establishment of \"sagreres\", the space surrounding the churches considered sacred territory, protected from feudal violence, under penalty of excommunication.\nFirst references to the name \"Catalonia\".\nThe term \"Catalonia\" is first documented in an early 12th-century Latin chronicle called the \"Liber maiolichinus\", where Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona is referred to as \"catalanicus heroes\", \"rector catalanicus\", and \"dux catalanensis\".\nSome manuscripts suggest that \"Catalunya\" (Latin \"Gathia Launia\") \"Gothia\" (or \"Gauthia\"), \"Land of the Goths\", since the origins of the Catalan counts, lords and people were found in the ancient March of Gothia, known as \"Gothia\", whence \"Gothland\" &gt; \"Gothlandia\" &gt; \"Gothalania\" from which \"Catalonia\" has been theoretically derived. During the Middle Ages, Byzantine chroniclers claimed that \"Catalania\" derives from the local medley of Goths with Alans, initially constituting a \"Goth-Alania\". Alternatively, the name may come from the word \"ca(s)telan\" (inhabitant of the castle) as the area had many fortifications.\nCatalonia and Aragon (1100\u20131469).\nDynastic union with Aragon.\nUntil the middle of the 12th century, the successive counts of Barcelona tried to expand their domain in multiple directions. Ramon Berenguer III incorporated the County of Besal\u00fa, part of the County of Emp\u00faries, all of the County of Cerdanya, and also the County of Provence through his marriage to Douce of Provence. The Catalan church, for its part, became independent of the bishopric of Narbonne by restoring the archiepiscopal see of Tarragona (1118).\nIn 1137 the dynastic union that would later be known as Crown of Aragon was established after Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona betrothed the heiress of the Kingdom of Aragon, Petronilla, after Ramiro II of Aragon agreed to donate his kingdom and his daughter Petronilla to Barcelona's Count, avoiding and protecting Aragon from a potential invasion and annexion by Castile. Ramon Berenguer IV used the title \"\"comes Barchinonensis\" (count of the Barcelonians) as his primary title and \"princeps Aragonensis\"\" (prince of the Aragonians) as his second title, beside his wife who retained her title of \"Regina\" (\"queen\"). Their son and heir, Alfonso II of Aragon and I of Barcelona consolidated the dynastic union as \"Rex Aragonum, Comes Barchinone et Marchio Provincie\" (\"king of Aragon, count of Barcelona, and marquis of Provence\"). Catalonia and Aragon retained their distinct traditional rights, and Catalonia its own personality with one of the first parliaments in Europe, the Catalan Courts (Catalan: \"Corts Catalanes\").\nIn addition, the reign of Ramon Berenguer IV saw the Catalan conquest of Lleida and Tortosa, completing the unification of all of the territory that comprises modern Catalonia. This included a territory to the south of the Catalan counties, which became known as \"Catalunya Nova\" (\"New Catalonia\") and which was repopulated with Catalans by the end of the 12th century.\nExpansion and institutionalization of the Principality.\nDuring the reign of Alfonso, in 1173, Catalonia was regarded as a legal entity for the first time, while the Usages of Barcelona were compiled in the process to turn them into the law of Catalonia (\"Consuetudinem Cathalonie\"). Apart from the Usages, between 1170 and 1195 the \"Liber feudorum maior\" and the \"Gesta Comitum Barchinonensium\" were also compiled and written, being considered together as the \"three milestones of Catalan political identity\".\nCatalonia became the base for the Aragonese Crown's sea power, which came to dominate a maritime empire that extended across the western Mediterranean after the conquest of Valencia, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and the accession in Sicily of the kings of Aragon. This period saw a large increase of maritime trade in Catalan ports, particularly of the Aragonese Crown's leading city, Barcelona.\nAt the end of the 12th century, a series of pacts between the crowns of Aragon and Castile delimited the zones that the two would each attempt to conquer from Muslim-ruled kingdoms, (the \"Reconquista\"); to the east, in 1213, the defeat and death of Peter II of Aragon (\"Peter the Catholic\") in the Battle of Muret put an end to the project of consolidating the Aragonese influence and power over Provence and the County of Toulouse. His successor James I of Aragon did not fully consolidate his power until 1227; once he consolidated his inherited realm, he began a series of new conquests. Over the course of the next quarter-century he conquered Majorca and Valencia. The latter became a new state, the third kingdom associated with the Crown of Aragon, with its own court and a new \"fuero\" (code of laws): the \"Furs de Val\u00e8ncia\". In contrast, the Majorcan territory together with that of the counties of Cerdanya, Vallespir, Capcir and Roussillon and the city of Montpellier were left as a kingdom for his son James II of Majorca as the Kingdom of Majorca. This division began a period of struggle that ended with the annexation of that kingdom by the Crown of Aragon in 1344 by Peter IV \"the Ceremonious\".\nIn 1258, James I and Louis IX of France signed the Treaty of Corbeil: the French king, as the heir of Charlemagne, renounced his claims of feudal overlordship over Catalonia, which it was effectively independent from French rule since the end of the 10th century, while James renounced his claims in Occitania.\nAt the same time, the Principality of Catalonia developed a complex institutional and political system based on the concept of a pact between the estates of the realm and the king. From 1283 onwards, legislation had to be approved in the General Court of Catalonia (or Catalan Courts), regarded the first parliamentary body of Europe that banned the royal power to create legislation unilaterally. The Courts were composed of the three estates, were presided over by the monarch as count of Barcelona, and approved the constitutions, which created a compilation of rights for the inhabitants of the Principality. In order to collect general taxes, the Courts of 1359 established a permanent representation of deputies, the Deputation of the General (Catalan: \"Diputaci\u00f3 del General\") and later usually known as Generalitat, which gained an important political power over the next centuries.\nThe Principality of Catalonia saw a prosperous period during the 13th century and the first half of the 14th. The population increased; Catalan culture expanded into the islands of the Western Mediterranean. The reign of Peter III of Aragon (\"the Great\") included the conquest of Sicily and the successful defense against a French crusade; his son and successor Alfonso (\"the Generous\") conquered Menorca; and Peter's second son James II, who first acceded to the throne of Sicily and then succeeded his older brother as king of Aragon, conquered Sardinia; under James II, and Catalonia was the center of the flourishing empire. Barcelona, then the most frequent royal residence, was consolidated as the administrative center of the domains with the establishment of the Royal Archives in 1318. The Catalan Company, mercenaries led by Roger de Flor and formed by Almogavar veterans of the War of the Sicilian Vespers, were hired by the Byzantine Empire to fight the Turks, defeating them in several battles. After the assassination of Roger de Flor by orders of the emperor's son Michael Palaiologos (1305), the Company took revenge sacking Thrace and later Greece, where they took the duchies of Athens and Neopatras in the name of the King of Aragon. Catalan rule over the Greek lands lasted until 1390. The Crown became the protector of the united Albanian principalities after the Treaty of Gaeta.\nThis territorial expansion was accompanied by a great development of the Catalan trade, centered in Barcelona, creating an extensive trade network across the Mediterranean which competed with those of the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice. In this line, institutions were created that would give legal protection to merchants, such as the Consulate of the Sea and the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, one of the first compilations of maritime law. The trade allowed the formation of banking. In 1401, the local authorities created a pioneering public bank, the Taula de canvi de Barcelona, arguably the world's first-ever central bank.\nThe second quarter of the 14th century saw crucial changes for Catalonia, marked by a succession of natural catastrophes, demographic crises, stagnation and decline in the Catalan economy, and the rise of social tensions. In 1333, known as \"Lo mal any primer\" (\"The first bad year\"), a severe famine affected the lands of the Crown. Between 1347 and 1497 the Principality of Catalonia lost 37 percent of its population. The reign of Peter the Ceremonious was a time of war: the annexation of Majorca, the quelling of a rebellion in Sardinia, a rebellion by an Aragonese faction who wished to extinguish local Catalan privileges in favor of a more centralized kingdom of Aragon, and an Aragonese-Castilian war. These wars created a delicate financial situation, in a framework of demographic and economic crisis, to which was added a generation later a crisis of succession generated by the death in 1410 of Martin I without a descendant or a named successor. A two-year interregnum progressively evolved in favor of a candidate from the Castilian Trast\u00e1mara dynasty, Ferdinand of Antequera, who on the Compromise of Caspe (1412), representatives of Aragon, Valencia and Catalonia appointed him monarch as Ferdinand I of Aragon. Opposition to Ferdinand, led by the alternate candidate James II, Count of Urgell, was defeated in 1413.\nThe 15th century.\nFerdinand's successor, Alfonso V (\"the Magnanimous\"), promoted a new stage of Aragonese expansion, this time over the Kingdom of Naples, over which he finally gained dominion in 1443. At the same time, though, he aggravated the social crisis in the Principality of Catalonia, both in the countryside and in the cities. Political conflict in Barcelona arose due to the disputes over the control of the Consell de Cent between two political factions, \"Biga\" and \"Busca\" looking for a solution to the economic crisis. Meanwhile, the \"remen\u00e7a\" (serfs') peasants subjected to the feudal abuses known as Evil customs began to organize themselves as a syndicate against seignorial pressures, searching protection from the monarch. Alfonso's brother, John II (\"the Unreliable\"), was an exceptionally deeply hated and opposed regent and ruler \u2013 both in the Basque kingdom of Navarre and in Catalonia.\nThe opposition of the institutions of Catalonia to the policies of John II resulted in their support to the son of John, Charles, Prince of Viana over his denied dynastic rights. In response of the detention of Charles by his father, the Generalitat established a political body, the Council of the Principality, with whom, under menace of a conflict, John was forced to negotiate. The Capitulation of Vilafranca (1461) forced to release Charles from prison and appoint him lieutenant of Catalonia, while the king would need permission of the Generalitat to enter the Principality. The content of the Capitulation represented a culmination and consolidation of pactism and the constitutional system of Catalonia. However, the disaggrament of King John, the death of Charles shortly after and the remen\u00e7a uprising in 1462 led to a ten-year Catalan civil war that left the country exhausted. In 1472, the last separate ruler of Catalonia, the king Ren\u00e9 of Anjou (\"the Good\"), lost the war against King John.\nThe \"remen\u00e7a\" conflict did not reach any definitive conclusion and in 1493 France returned the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne, which it had occupied during the conflict. Ferdinand II of Aragon (\"the Catholic\") profoundly reformed Catalan institutions, recovered without war the northern Catalan counties, increased active involvement in Italy and finally resolved the major grievances of the \"remences\" with the Sentencia Arbitral de Guadalupe in 1486, in exchange for a payment. The Sentencia allowed the beginning of the right to freely contract emphyteutic agreements, which led to general prosperity in the Catalan countryside throughout the next centuries. In the frame of the institutional reforms of Ferdinand, in 1481 the Catalan Courts approved the Constituci\u00f3 de l'Observan\u00e7a, which established the submission of royal power to the laws of the Principality of Catalonia.\nEarly modern period (1469\u20131808).\nCrown of Aragon union with Crown of Castile.\nFerdinand's 1469 marriage to Isabella I of Castile brought about a dynastic union of the Crown of Aragon with Castile. After the 1512 invasion of the Kingdom of Navarre, in 1516 the monarchies were formally united into a single Monarchy of Spain (\"Kingdom of the Spains\", as it was sometimes known). Each realm of the Monarchy conserved its political institutions and maintained its own courts, laws, public administration, and separate coinage of money.\nWhen Christopher Columbus made his discovery in The Americas during a Spanish-sponsored expedition, and began to shift Europe's trade and economic centre of gravity (and the focus of Spain's ambitions) from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic Ocean, undermining Catalonia's economic and political importance. Aragonese and Catalan power in the Mediterranean would continue, but efforts to achieve further Spanish conquests in Europe itself largely stopped and the maritime expansion into the Atlantic and the conquest of territories in the Americas was not a Catalan enterprise. Castile and the realms of Aragon were separate states until 1716 in spite of a shared crown and the newly established colonies in the Americas and Pacific were Castilian, administered as appendages of Castile, until in 1778 Seville was the only port authorized to trade in America, and despite the dynastic union Catalans, as subjects of the Crown of Aragon, had no right to trade directly with the Castilian-ruled Americas.\nBy virtue of descent from his maternal grandparents, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, in 1516 Charles I of Spain became the first king to rule the Crowns of Castile and Aragon simultaneously by his own right. Following the death of his paternal (House of Habsburg) grandfather, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was also elected Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1519. In the 16th century, the Catalan population began a demographic recovery and some measure of economic recovering. The reign of Charles V was a relative harmonious period, during which Catalonia generally accepted the new structure of Spain, despite its own marginalization. As the focus of Spanish maritime power and of European rivalry shifted to the Atlantic, the Kingdom of Valencia became the most important kingdom of the Aragonese Crown, eclipsing Barcelona. The reign of Philip II marked the beginning of a gradual process of stagnation of Catalan economy, language, and culture. Among the most negative elements of the period were a rise in piracy along the coasts and banditry in the interior.\nThe Reapers' War.\nConflicts had already arisen between Catalonia and the monarchy in the time of Philip II. Having exhausted the economic resources of Castile, Philip wished to avail himself of those of the other polities of the Monarchy; Catalan institutions and laws were well protected by the terms and nature of the union of crowns, and were jealously guarded by the Catalan population, who during those times saw an increase of its participation in the local and general government of the Principality. After Philip IV acceded to the throne in 1621, his minister the Count-Duke of Olivares attempted to sustain an ambitious foreign policy by taxing the kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula and establishing a military contribution to the Empire in each one of them (the \"Uni\u00f3n de Armas\", \"Union of Arms\"), which meant laying aside the until-then-prevailing principles of the composite monarchy, in favor of an increased centralization. Resistance in Catalonia was especially strong, given the lack of any significant apparent regional return for the sacrifices. The Catalan Courts of 1626 and 1632 were never concluded, due to the opposition of the estates against the economical and military measures of Olivares, many of which violated the Catalan constitutions. The failure of the Courts aggravated the tensions between Catalan institutions and Monarchy, favoring a scenario of rupture.\nThe Reapers' War (, 1640\u201359) started as an uprising of peasants in northern areas of Catalonia. When Spanish \"tercios\" (military corps) concentrated in Roussillon at the end of the 1630s, because of the Thirty Years' War with France, local peasants were required to lodge and provision the troops, thus creating a large tension and discomfort among them, and events such as religious sacrileges, destruction of personal properties and rape of local women by the soldiers were reported. The protest of the peasantry in the north quickly extended to Barcelona; On 7 June 1640 an uprising in Barcelona known as the Corpus de Sang, led by reapers, took the lives of various royal functionaries, Dalmau de Queralt, Count of Santa Coloma and viceroy of Catalonia was assassinated during the events. Mutinies continued; due to the few weeks later Pau Claris, president of the Generalitat of Catalonia, formed a \"Junta de Bra\u00e7os\" or \"Bra\u00e7os Generals\" (States-General), a consultive body similar to the Courts. The calling was a success, and the presence of cities and feudal villages was exceptionally large. The assembly assumed the sovereignty and began to enact and apply various revolutionary measures, such as the establishment of a Council of Justice, a Council of Defense to respond to the expected Royal counter-attack and a Council of Treasury which began to issue debt and a special tax to the nobility, while maintained diplomatic contacts with the Kingdom of France, allowing the French army to cross the Pyrenees into the Iberian Peninsula. After the fall of Tortosa to the royal armies, the break with the Spanish Monarchy became evident and the military clashes began. The Spanish armies perpetrated a massacre in Cambrils on 16 December, convincing Catalan leadership that they could not expect any pardon or negotiated solution from them.\nWith the Spanish royal armies approaching Barcelona, on 17 January 1641 the Junta de Bra\u00e7os accepted the establishment of the Catalan Republic under the protection of France, however a week later the Catalan institutions, needing more French military aid, accepted King Louis XIII as Count of Barcelona. Combined Catalan and French armies defeated the Spanish armies at the gates of Barcelona, in the battle of Montju\u00efc, on 26 January 1641. The French general Marquis of Br\u00e9z\u00e9, Marshal of France was appointed viceroy of Catalonia, and the Franco-Catalan forces obtained victories in Montmel\u00f3 and Lleida. However, the French administration increased its control over the Principality, and some of the same conflicts between peasants and soldiers, but this time French ones, erupted.\nAfter major setbacks, from 1644 onwards a renewed offensive of the Spanish troops took Lleida, driven out the French and crushed the Catalan forces. Although the French were initially able to resist the offensive, the outbreak of the Fronde in 1651 diverted their efforts and by 1652 Barcelona fell after a one-year siege; most of the Principality of Catalonia was once again under control of the Monarchy of Spain, With the aim to avoid a prolongation of the conflict, Philip IV recognized in 1644 most of the rights of Catalonia. When the war between Spain and France ended in 1659, the peace treaty ceded the Catalan territories north of the Pyrenees, the counties of Roussillon and the northern half of Cerdanya, to France. Catalan institutions were suppressed in the French Roussillon, in 1700, public use of Catalan language was prohibited. Today, this region is administratively part of French \"D\u00e9partement\" of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales.\nWar of the Spanish Succession.\nIn the last decades of the 17th century during the reign of Spain's last Habsburg king, Charles II, despite intermittent conflict between Spain and France, the population increased to approximately 500,000 inhabitants and the Catalan economy improved, not only in Barcelona, but also along the Catalan coast and even in some inland areas. The economic growth was boosted by the export of wine to England and the Dutch Republic because due to the trade war of French minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert against the Dutch and later to the participation of these countries in the Nine Years' War against France, they were not able to trade with the French. This new context caused many Catalans to look to England and, especially, the Netherlands as political and economic models for Catalonia.\nHowever, at the end of the century, after the death of the childless Charles II (1700), the Crown of Spain went to his chosen successor, Philip V of the House of Bourbon. The Grand Alliance of Austria, England and the United Provinces gave military support to a Habsburg claimant of the crown, Archduke Charles as Charles III of Spain, resulting in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701\u201314). The Principality of Catalonia initially accepted Philip V following prolonged negotiations between Philip V and the Catalan Courts between 12 October 1701 and 14 January 1702, which resulted in an agreement where Catalonia retained all its previous privileges and gained a Court of Contraventions (\"Tribunal de Contrafaccions\"), the status of free port (\"Port Franc\") for Barcelona as well as the limited right to commerce with America, but this did not last. Repressive mesures of the viceroy Francisco de Velasco and authoritarian decisions of the king (some of them contrary to Catalan legislation), as well as the economic policy and distrust to the French absolutism caused Catalonia to switch sides. In 1705 the Archduke entered Barcelona, which was recognized as king in 1706 by the last Catalan Courts.\nAfter a series of advances and stalemates of both sides, geopolitical changes in Europe led to peace with the signature of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), ending the possibility of Catalonia's resistance to Bourbon rule. Despite the evacuation of the Allied armies, in July 1713 the Junta de Bra\u00e7os of Catalonia opted to unilaterally remain in the war in order to protect Catalan rights and lives from Bourbon punishment, rising the Army of Catalonia and attempting to obtain help from Britain and Austria. After thirteen months of siege by Spanish and French armies which included pro-Habsburg uprisings in Catalonia's countryside, Barcelona capitulation on 11 September 1714. The Bourbon king, determined to punish what he saw as sedition from the realms of the Crown of Aragon promulgated the Nueva Planta decrees (1707 for Aragon and Valencia, 1715 for Majorca and 1716 for Catalonia), abolishing the Catalan, Majorcan, Valencian and Aragonese institutions and rights, and with it the Catalan Courts, the Generalitat, the Consell de Cent of Barcelona and the Catalan constitutions, except those of civil law, replacing them with the Castilian ones and establishing absolutism as the new form of government, thus, ending their status as separate political entities. In order to ensure it, he created a new Royal Audience as seat of government of the province and replaced the traditional vegueries with Castilian corregimientos as the territorial division of Catalonia. Rooted in the absolutist political position of Philip V, the assimilation of the Crown of Aragon by the Crown of Castile through the Decrees was the first step in the creation of the Spanish nation state.\nHe suppressed the six Catalan universities and founded a new one in Cervera (Lleida) and abolished the administrative use of the Catalan language; replacing it with Spanish. While the replacement solely affected the Royal Audience, the king provided with secret instructions to the royal officers in Catalan territory: they \"will take the utmost care to introduce the Castilian language, for which purpose he will give the most temperate and disguised measures so that the effect is achieved, without the care being noticed.\" Half a century later, under the reign of Charles III of Bourbon, the Catalan language would also be banned from primary and secondary schools.\nThe 18th century.\nDespite the harsh internal situation, including military occupation, banditry, new heavy taxation and the mercantilist policy of the House of Bourbon, Catalonia resumed the economic growth of the last third of the 17th century after the parentheses of the war, achieving a successful process of proto-industrialization in the course of the 18th century. The population and the economy both grew, agricultural production increased, and trade increased, complemented during the last quarter of the century with the opening of trade with America; all of these transformations tended, as in France, to undermine the Old Regime and lay the groundwork for the rise of industrialization, the first signs of which appeared in the 18th-century manufacture of cotton goods and other textiles. By the end of the 18th century, the popular classes began to experience the first effects of proletarianization.\nIn the 1790s, new conflicts arose on the French border, due to the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1793, after the execution of Louis XVI of France, Spain signed with Great Britain his adhesion to the First Coalition against the French Republic, and soon after, France declared war on Spain. The War of the Pyrenees, known in Catalonia as the \"Guerra Gran\" (\"Great War\") has two main fronts: the eastern and the western Pyrenees. At first, the Spanish army entered in the Roussillon, reaching Perpignan, but the French army reacted and defeated them in Le Boulou and Colliure, penetrating in Catalonia and occupied the Empord\u00e0. The Sant Ferran Castle in Figueres (the largest fortress of the border) fell to the French after a brief siege. In 1795, after the stagnation of the front, France and Spain signed the Peace of Basel, restoring the status quo.\nModern period (1808\u20131939).\nNapoleonic Wars.\nIn 1808, during the Napoleonic Wars, Catalonia was occupied by the troops of General Guillaume Philibert Duhesme. The official Spanish army had evaporated, but popular resistance against the French occupation occurred in Catalonia as in other parts of Spain, and eventually developed into the Peninsular War. A local army defeated the French in a series of battles at El Bruc, near Barcelona. Meanwhile, Girona was besieged by the French and defended by its inhabitants under the direction of general and military governor Mariano \u00c1lvarez de Castro. The French finally took the city on 10 December 1809, after many deaths on both sides from hunger, epidemics, and cold; \u00c1lvarez de Castro died in prison one month later.\nThe rejection to French dominion was institutionalized with the creation of \"juntas\" (councils) across Spain who, remaining loyal to the Bourbons, exercised the sovereignty and representation of the territory due to the disappearance of the old institutions, and sending delegates to the Cortes of C\u00e1diz. In Catalonia, the juntas of Catalan corregimientos established in Lleida the Superior Junta of the Government of the Principality of Catalonia which it declared itself as depositary of the faculties of the Royal Audience of Catalonia, as well as the legislative power. At the same time, Napoleon took direct control of Catalonia to establish order, creating the Government of Catalonia under the rule of Marshall Augereau, and making Catalan briefly an official language again. Between 1812 and 1813, Catalonia was directly annexed to France itself, and organized an ordinary civil administration in the form of four (later two) d\u00e9partements: Bouches-de-l'\u00c8bre (prefecture: Lleida), Montserrat (Barcelona), S\u00e8gre (Puigcerd\u00e0), and Ter (Girona). French dominion in parts of Catalonia lasted until 1814, when the British General Wellington signed the armistice by which the French left Barcelona and the other strongholds that they had managed to keep until the last.\nThe Carlist wars and the liberal state.\nThe reign of Ferdinand VII (reigned 1814\u20131833) saw several Catalan uprisings and after his death, the conflict over the succession between the absolutist \"Carlist\" partisans of Infante Carlos and the liberal partisans of Isabella II led to the First Carlist War, which lasted until 1840 and was especially virulent in the Catalan territory. Catalonia was divided. The most industrialized areas support liberalism and the Catalan bourgeoisie tries to contribute to the construction of the new liberal state. As with the Basques, many Catalans fought on the Carlist side, not necessarily because they supported absolute monarchy, but because some of them hoped that restoration of the Old Regime would mean restoration of their \"fueros\" and recovery of regional autonomy.\nThe victory of the liberals over the absolutists led to a \"bourgeois revolution\" during the reign of Isabella II. In 1834, by decree of minister Javier de Burgos, Spain was organized into provinces, included Catalonia, which was divided in four provinces (Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona) without a common administration. The reign of Isabella II was marked by corruption, administrative inefficiency, centralism, and political and social tensions. The liberals soon divided into \"moderates\" and \"progressives\", and in Catalonia a republican current began to develop; also, inevitably, Catalans generally favored a more federal Spain. During the second third of the century, there were various progressive uprisings in Barcelona and other places, known as bullangues. The last insurrection of the period, the Jam\u00e0ncia (1843), which tried to expel the government of General Espartero and proposed a progressive program and postulates close to federalism, ended with Barcelona blocked and bombed by the army, representing the triumph of the moderates and its centralist politics.\nThe Second Carlist War (1846\u20131849) took place fundamentally in Catalonia, largely promoted by the displeasure of large sectors of the population with the moderate model of the liberal state that was being established at that time. This explains the collaboration of the progressives and republicans with the Carlists in 1848, coinciding with the democratic revolutions in France and the rest of Europe.\nWhen General O'Donnell, leader of the Liberal Union, was appointed as prime minister in 1856 seems that the relationship between Catalan society and the Spanish government became more hopeful. Surprisingly, the reaction in Catalonia to the Hispano-Moroccan War was enthusiastic, and it was organized a company of Catalan volunteers that were received in Africa by the General Joan Prim, born in Reus. The fall of the government of the Liberal Union without being able to accomplish the expected reforms and the return of the moderates to power ended the hopes of Catalan society.\nIn September 1868, Spain's continuing economic crisis triggered the September Revolution or \"La Gloriosa\", resulting in the deposition of Isabella II and beginning the so-called Sexenio Democr\u00e1tico, the \"six democratic years\" (1868\u20131874). As usual, popular revolts and juntas were formed across the country, until the new government ordered its dissolution. General Joan Prim was appointed Prime Minister of the Provisional Government (1869\u20131870), his government called to a parliamentary election by universal manhood suffrage for the first time in order to establish the political future of Spain. In Catalonia, federalists republicans won the overall majority of seats, while the general results in Spain gave a victory to a progressive monarchist coalition. Spain was declared a democratic monarchy and Amadeo of Savoy elected new king. Few days before the arrival of Amadeo, Prim was assassinated. Meanwhile, the federalists republicans of Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia and Balearic Islands signed the Federal Pact of Tortosa (1869) and there was a federalist revolt at the same year.\nThe rise of Amadeo I to the throne of Spain (1870\u20131873) proved unstable, his reign saw the outbreak of the Third Carlist War (1872\u20131876), Cuba's fight for independence, the spread of the ideas of the First International and economic troubles, ending with the resignation of the king. This decision allowed the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic (1873\u20131874). The Republic fought against the inherited problems and with others like the cantonal insurrection. During its short existence it was unable to establish a federal republic and it had four presidents. Its first presidents, Estanislau Figueras and Francesc Pi i Margall, were Catalans. Along the period there were attempts from radical federalists to proclaim a federated Catalan State. After the fall of president Emilio Castelar, the General Pavia made a coup d'\u00e9tat, disbanding the Cortes and appointed General Serrano as president without parliamentary control.\nIndustrialization, Renaixen\u00e7a and Modernisme.\nSince the 1830s, boosted by the conditions of proto-industrialization of the prior two centuries of the Catalan urban areas and its countryside, Catalonia became a centre of Spain's industrialization and it became one of the largest textile producers in the Mediterranean. In 1832 the Bonaplata Factory was established, the first industrial establishment in the country to make use of the steam engine. Catalonia had to contend with a grave shortage of energy resources and the weakness of the domestic Spanish market. To encourage industrial expansion, Spain established protectionist policies which reduced foreign competition domestically (although the policy of Spanish government during those times changed many times between free trade and protectionism). Catalonia saw the first railway construction in the Iberian Peninsula in 1848, linking Barcelona with Matar\u00f3, built with private capital. These initiatives partially benefitted the country's industrial regions, Catalonia, the Basque Country and later Asturias. As in much of Europe, the working class lived and worked in often inhuman conditions.\nAs a response to the lack of energy resources, a large number of factories were installed on the margins of the rivers when the use of the water turbine widespread. Usually, the factories included a company town; Catalonia has a high density of such towns, known locally as industrial colonies (\"col\u00f2nies industrials\"). They are especially concentrated in river basins along the Ter and Llobregat. In the comarca of Bergued\u00e0, for example, within 20\u00a0km there were 14 colonies. These were small towns created around a factory, built in a rural areas, distant any other population centres. They housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants, and in some cases around 1000 people. These industrial colonies were a typical aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially from the 1870s onwards. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. There are more than 75 textile colonies recorded; although there were also mining, metallurgy and agricultural colonies.\nDuring the 19th century, as well as other Spaniards, there were Catalan business involved in the Atlantic slave trade, taking advantage of the void left by the British abolition of the trade in 1807. Catalan immigrants in Spanish America also became heavily involved in owning and running slave plantations in Cuba and Puerto Rico. Between 1817 and 1867, Catalans were involved in the transportation of 550,000 to 700,000 slaves from West Africa to the Caribbean. Although the Spanish government had abolished slave trading in 1817, it turned a blind eye to illicit slave trading. When slavery was abolished in the Spanish Empire in 1886, some Catalans returned to Catalonia and invested their newfound fortunes in constructing opulent mansions in areas such as La Rambla. There are sources that links the slave trade with the financiation of the industrialisation of Catalonia and the 19th-century building boom in Barcelona, although the industrialization started one century before, banks were the usual souce of finantiation, and most families involved has any relation with american slavery.\nThe second third of the 19th century saw a Catalan cultural renaissance (Renaixen\u00e7a), a cultural movement to recover Catalan language and culture after a long period of decay. As with most of the other Romantic movements, it was noted for its admiration of the Middle Ages, which was often reflected in art and, in Barcelona, the literary contest known as Floral Games (\"Jocs Florals\") was revived. The historical research of Antoni de Capmany, the interest in normalizing the Catalan language and the emergence of an incipient intellectuality interested in popular culture are already produced during the Enlightenment. Josep Pau Ballot wrote \"Gramatica y apolog\u00eda de la llengua cathalana\" between 1810 and 1813, during the French occupation. This work is realized with patriotic intention and disseminator of the use of Catalan. Between 1833 and the reestablishment of the Floral Games in 1859, the Catalan language lives in a situation of disglossy: many authors of the Renaixen\u00e7a wrote some literature and poetry in Catalan, but they will continue to use Spanish in their main works. However, the popular classes continued to use Catalan, and during this period popular theater in Catalan became relevant, unlike the representations of the Liceu addressed to the bourgeoisie, which used Spanish.\nCatalan nationalism and the workers movement.\nIn 1874, a coup by General Mart\u00ednez Campos in Sagunto led to a restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in the person of Alfonso XII. A period of political stability, of repression of the workers movement, and of a slow growth in Catalan nationalist identity extended to the early years of the 20th century, when once again political opposition broke to the fore, especially republicanism and Catalan nationalism, but also class-based politics reflecting social tensions.\nThe following decades saw the rise of the political Catalanism still prevalent today: the first formulations of the modern Catalan national identity can be seen in Valent\u00ed Almirall, a relevant federalist republican. Almirall, despite being a left-wing republican, tried to unite the Catalan left and right, but he did not succeed because there were too many divergences between the two currents. He promoted the First Catalanist Congress, held in 1880, in which the different Catalanist groups were united: federal republicanism and the apolitical current, the literary one, from \"La Renaixen\u00e7a\" magazine, but the leftist tendencies of Almirall caused that the group of the Renaixen\u00e7a left the Congress and broke the agreement. However, the Congress took three fundamental agreements: creating an entity that brings together Catalanism (the Centre Catal\u00e0, \"Catalan Center\"), the beginning of efforts to establish the Academy of the Catalan Language, and the drafting of a document on defense of Catalan as official language. The crisis of the Centre Catal\u00e0 was shown due the differences around the position about the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition. The opposite positions led to the dissolution of the group, and the left-wing Catalan nationalism was seriously weakened for decades.\nThe conservative elements of Catalan nationalism founded the League of Catalonia in 1887 who, in 1891, were united with the group \"La Renaixen\u00e7a\", creating the Uni\u00f3 Catalanista (Catalanist Union). The \"Uni\u00f3\" redacted, in 1892, the Basis of Catalan regional autonomy, also known as \"Bases de Manresa\", a program that demanded a specific autonomy for Catalonia. In 1901 Enric Prat de la Riba and Francesc Camb\u00f3 formed the Regionalist League (\"Lliga Regionalista\"), which in 1906 led the successful electoral coalition Solidaritat Catalana, created by diverse Catalan political groups (from conservative to Catalan left-wing nationalists and from republicanism to carlism) as a response to Cu-Cut! affair, in which officers of the Spanish Army, angry with this satirical magazine for publish an offending joke about the war in Morocco, stormed the Cu-Cut! offices, and the subsequent \"Ley de Jurisdicciones\", that punish the \"crimes\" and \"insults\" against the army and the symbols of the nation, putting them under military trials.\nCatalan nationalism, under the leadership of Prat de la Riba, achieved in 1913 a victory in obtaining partial self-government for the \"Commonwealth\" (Catalan: \"Mancomunitat\"; Spanish: \"Mancomunidad\"), a grouping of the four Catalan provinces, presided over first by Prat de la Riba, and later by Josep Puig i Cadafalch; this was later suppressed in March 1925, during the 1923\u20131930 dictatorship of Miguel Primo de Rivera. The Commonwealth of Catalonia established a modern infrastructure, such as roads and telephones and expanded the culture (libraries, professional education, use and regulation of Catalan language, promotion of sciences...). In 1919 the Commonwealth promoted the first project of Statute of Autonomy, but the disagreements with the government of Madrid, the opposition of sectors of Spanish society and the coincidence with the rise of the workers movement provoked the fall of the project.\nThe Catalan workers movement at the turn of the twentieth century consisted of three tendencies: syndicalism, socialism, and anarchism, part of the last openly embracing \"propaganda of the deed\" as advocated by Alejandro Lerroux. Along with Asturias, Catalonia in general and Barcelona in particular was a center of radical labor agitation, marked by numerous general strikes, assassinations (especially in the late 1910s), and the rise of the pro-anarchist Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour, CNT, founded in Barcelona in 1910). Growing resentment of conscription and of the military culminated in the Tragic Week in Barcelona in 1909, resulting in the deaths of over 100 citizens. The anarchists had been active throughout the early 20th century, achieving, after a successful strike which paralyzed much of the industry of Catalonia, the first eight-hour workday of Western Europe in 1919. The escalating violence between Catalan workers and the Catalan bourgeoisie (\"Pistolerismo\") led the latter to embrace the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera, despite his centralizing tendencies. (\"See also Anarchism in Spain\").\nThe initial acceptance of the Dictatorship by the conservative League made the Catalan nationalism progressively more leftist (with the rise of parties as Acci\u00f3 Catalana, Catalan Republican Party or the Socialist Union of Catalonia) and, some of them, also pro-independence (Estat Catal\u00e0). Despite this tolerance, Primo de Rivera abolished the Commonwealth of Catalonia in 1925 and started a policy of repression against the Catalan nationalism, Catalan language and labour movement (especially anarchism and communism). In 1926, Estat Catal\u00e0 tried to liberate Catalonia with a little army (established in the town of Prats de Moll\u00f3 in Roussillon, France), led by Francesc Maci\u00e0, and proclaim the independent Catalan Republic, but the complot was discovered by the French police. Maci\u00e0 and the Catalan issue gained popularity all over the world.\nDuring the last steps of the Dictatorship, Barcelona celebrated the 1929 International Exposition, while Spain started to suffer an economical crisis caused by the economical policy of the government and the Wall Street crash.\nRepublic and autonomy.\nAfter the fall of Primo de Rivera, the Catalan left made great efforts to create a united front under the leadership of left-wing independentist leader Francesc Maci\u00e0, founder of Estat Catal\u00e0. The \"Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya\" (Republican Left of Catalonia, or ERC) represented a break with the electoral abstentionism that, until then had been characteristic of the Catalan workers. Advocating moderate socialism, republicanism and Catalan self-determination, the party achieved a spectacular victory in the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, which preceded the 14 April proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic. After a brief proclamation of the Catalan Republic (14\u201317 April) by the ERC leader, Francesc Maci\u00e0, the Generalitat of Catalonia was revived as an autonomous government, and a Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia was approved on 9 September 1932 by the Cortes of the Republic after many discussions and political difficulties that considerably amended the original project. The Statute gave a strong, though not absolute, grant of self-government, and declared Catalan as official language in Catalonia alongside Spanish. A similar statute granted autonomy to the Basque Country, few years later. The Parliament of Catalonia was elected on 20 November 1932, and ERC won a large majority of seats, while the Regionalist League, almost hegemonic during the Monarchy, came in second place but far behind ERC.\nUnder its two presidents, Francesc Maci\u00e0 (1931\u20131933) and Llu\u00eds Companys (1934\u20131939), the Republican Generalitat, democratically led by the left, carried out a considerable task in different areas such as culture, health, education and civil law, despite the serious economic crisis that the Republic inherited, its social repercussions, the low fiscal autonomy granted by the Statute, and the political vicissitudes of the period. On 25 December 1933 Maci\u00e0 died and the Parliament appointed Companys as new president. Under his presidency, the Parliament continued to legislate in order to improve the living conditions of the popular classes and the petite bourgeoisie, approving laws like the Crop Contracts Law, which protected the tenant farmers and granted access to the land they were cultivating, but it was contested by the Regionalist League and provoking a legal dispute with the Spanish government led by Ricardo Samper, rising the tensions. Meanwhile, the Generalitat established its own Court of Cassation (Catalan: \"Tribunal de Cassaci\u00f3\") and assumed executive powers in public order. The Statute was suspended in 1934, due to an uprising in Barcelona on 6 October of that year. President Companys proclaimed the Catalan State of the Spanish Federal Republic, as a response to the accession of right-wing Spanish nationalist party CEDA to the government of the Republic. The CEDA was considered close to fascism and, therefore, they feared that it was the first step of this party to suppress the autonomy and take the power in Spain as Hitler and Dollfuss made in Germany and Austria. The proclamation was quickly suppressed by the Spanish army, and the Catalan Government members were arrested.\nAs for the workers' movement, there was a crisis in the CNT (the greatest trade union in Catalonia at the time) with the break-away faction in the 1930s and its hostility against the Republic as a bourgeoisie regime growth, realizing demonstrations, general strikes and proclamations of the libertarian communism in some places like in the Alt Llobregat mining area in 1932, while the Marxist parties were progressively unified with the formation of the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (, POUM) in September 1935 and Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (Catalan: \"Partit Socialista Unificat de Catalunya\", PSUC) in July 1936.\nAfter the electoral victory of the left in the Spanish general election of February 1936 the government of the Generalitat was pardoned and reinstated in their functions. The period between that event and the military rebellion of July 1936 is considered as relatively peaceful in Catalonia, in contrast with the rest of Spain. The Parliament restored their legislative activities and the government prepared the People's Olympiad in Barcelona, as a response against the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, which was then under control of Nazi Germany, but the same day of its planned inauguration (19 July), the Spanish Army carried out a partially failed coup d'\u00e9tat which led to the Spanish Civil War.\nCivil War.\nThe defeat of the initial military rebellion against the Republican government in Barcelona by forces of the Generalitat and workers' militias placed Catalonia firmly in the Republican camp. The loyalist victory allowed to the workers' self-armed militias, predominantly anarchists, to become the real power of the streets, which meant the beginning of a harsh repression in Catalonia against those elements of being \"fascist\" or right-wing sympathizers. Both the Generalitat and the central government were unable to stop the arbitrary revolutionary violence. During the war, there were two powers coexisting in Catalonia: the \"de jure\" power of the Generalitat and the \"de facto\" power of the armed popular militias. In order to begin the recovering of some control of the situation, Companys authorized on July 21 the establishment of a joint body by the different Catalan republican parties and the anarchist CNT and socialist UGT trade unions, The Central Committee of Antifascist Militias of Catalonia (CCMA), becoming the effective Catalan government until its dissolution, two months later, replaced by a new government of the Generalitat which included anarchist ministers. Throughout Catalonia many sectors of the economy fell under the control of the CNT and the UGT, where workers' self-management was implemented. These included any kind of industry and services and thousands of dwellings previously owned by the upper classes. Initially, the newly collectivized factories encountered various problems. In response to these problems, the Generalitat, backed by the CNT approved a decree on \"Collectivization and Workers' Control\" on 24 October 1936. Under this decree all firms with more than 100 workers were to be collectivized and those with 100 or less could be collectivized if a majority of workers agreed. Violent confrontations between the workers' parties culminated in the defeat of the CNT-FAI and POUM in the 1937 May Days, against whom the PSUC unleashed strong repression. The local situation resolved itself progressively in favor of the Generalitat, but at the same time the Generalitat partially lost its autonomous power within republican Spain.\nThe military forces of the Generalitat, weakly structured between December 1936 and May 1937 in the People's Army of Catalonia (\"Ex\u00e8rcit Popular de Catalunya\"), were concentrated on two fronts: Aragon and Majorca. The latter was an utter disaster. The Aragon front resisted firmly until 1938, when the occupation of Lleida and Balaguer destabilized it. Finally, Franco's troops broke the republican territory in two by occupying the Valencian coastal town of Vinar\u00f2s, isolating Catalonia from the rest of Republican Spain. The defeat of the Republican army in the Battle of the Ebro led in 1938 and 1939 to the occupation of Catalonia by Franco's forces, who abolished completely the Catalan self-government and brought in a dictatorial regime, which took strong measures against Catalan nationalism and culture. Only forty years later, after Franco's death (1975) and the adoption of a democratic constitution in Spain (1978), did Catalonia recover its autonomy and reconstitute the Generalitat (1977).\nGeorge Orwell served with the POUM in Catalonia from December 1936 until June 1937. His memoir of that time, \"Homage to Catalonia\", was first published in 1938 and foreshadowed the causes of Second World War. It remains one of the most widely read books on the Spanish Civil War.\nContemporary period (1939\u2013present).\nFranco's dictatorship.\nAs in the rest of Spain, the Franco era (1939\u20131975) in Catalonia saw the annulment of democratic liberties, the prohibition and persecution of parties, the rise of thoroughgoing censorship, and the banning of all leftist institutions. In Catalonia it also meant, yet again, the annulment of the Statute of Autonomy, the banning of the whole specifically Catalan institutions and legislation. Catalan was subject to oppression and was reduced to family use. Castilian (Spanish) became the only language of education, administration and the media. During the first years, all resistance was energetically suppressed, the prisons filled up with political prisoners, and thousands of Catalans went into exile. In addition, 4000 Catalans were executed between 1938 and 1953, among them the former president of the Generalitat Llu\u00eds Companys (taken to Spain from his exile in the German-occupied France).\nThe Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. The economic recovery was very slow and it was not until the second half of the 1950s that the economy of Catalonia reached the prewar levels of 1936. After an initial period in which Spain tried to build an autarky, in which the economy improved little, Franco's regime changed its economic policies in 1959 and in the 1960s and early 1970s the economy entered a period of rapid economic expansion that became known as the Spanish Miracle. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were relatively low, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. The period was marked by agricultural modernization, a massive expansion of industry and the start of mass tourism, which it was concentrated on the coast (Costa Brava in Girona and Costa Daurada in Tarragona). As industry in Catalonia expanded, workers migrated from rural areas across Spain (particularly Andalusia, Extremadura, Murcia and Galicia), to work in Barcelona and its surrounding area, turning it into one of Europe's largest industrial metropolitan areas, which in turn led to dramatic urbanisation. Working-class opposition to Franco began to appear, usually clandestinely, and most notably in the form of the Comisiones Obreras (\"Workers Commissions\"), a return of trade union organizing, and the revival of the PSUC, while the students' protests turned frequent. In the 1970s democratic forces united under the banner of the Assembly of Catalonia (\"Assemblea de Catalunya\"), demanding political and social freedom, amnesty for the political prisoners, the reestablishment of the autonomy of Catalonia and the collaboration with the democratic forces of the rest of Spain.\nDuring later stages of Francoist Spain, folkloric and religious celebrations in Catalan resumed and were tolerated. Use of Catalan in the mass media had been forbidden, but was permitted from the early 1950s in the theatre. During the 60s and 70s the Catalan music entered into a period of renewal and growth known as Nova Can\u00e7\u00f3. Initially appeared with Els Setze Jutges group, it quickly became a mass phenomenon that incorporated the protest song against the Dictatorship and helped bring forth prominent singers and groups such as Joan Manuel Serrat, Llu\u00eds Llach, Raimon, Maria del Mar Bonet, Ovidi Montllor or Grup de Folk.\nDemocracy restored.\nFranco's death initiated a period that came to be known as the \"democratic transition\", during which democratic liberties were restored, culminating in the Spanish Constitution of 1978. This constitution recognized the existence of multiple national communities within Spain and proposed the division of the country into autonomous communities. After the first general election in 1977 the Generalitat was restored as a provisional government, headed by its president in exile Josep Tarradellas, and including representatives of the various leading forces of the time. In 1979, the new Statute of Autonomy was finally approved delegating more autonomy in matters of education and culture than the Republican 1932 Statute, but less in terms of the systems of justice and public order. In it, Catalonia is defined as a \"nationality\", Catalan is recognized as Catalonia's own language, and became co-official with Spanish. First election to the Parliament of Catalonia under this Statute gave the Catalan presidency to Jordi Pujol, a position he would hold until 2003. During this time he also led Converg\u00e8ncia i Uni\u00f3 (Convergence and Unity, CiU) a center-right Catalan nationalist electoral coalition consisting of his own Converg\u00e8ncia Democr\u00e0tica de Catalunya (Democratic Convergence of Catalonia, CDC) and the smaller and more conservative Uni\u00f3 Democr\u00e0tica de Catalunya (Democratic Union of Catalonia, UDC).\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s the institutions of Catalan autonomy continued to develop, among them an autonomous police force (called \"Mossos d'Esquadra\", officially refunded as the police of Catalonia in 1983), the restoration of the comarcal administrations (roughly equivalent to United States \"counties\" or United Kingdom \"shires\" or \"counties\", but distinct from the historical Catalan counties) and a High Court in the form of the High Court of Justice of Catalonia (Catalan: \"Tribunal Superior de Just\u00edcia de Catalunya\"). Catalonia's Law of Linguistic Normalization promoted Catalan-language media. The broadcasting network Televisi\u00f3 de Catalunya and its first channel TV3, which broadcast mainly in Catalan, were created in 1983. The Catalan government also provides subsidies to various means of promoting Catalan culture, including for example the making of Catalan-language films or the subtitling of foreign-language films in Catalan.\nIn 1992 Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics, which brought international attention to Catalonia. During the 1990s, the absence of absolute majorities in the Spanish parliament made governments reliant on support from the various nationalist parties (Catalan, Basque, Canary Islands, etc.) which was leveraged by CiU, to broaden the scope of Catalan autonomy during the last government of Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez (1993\u20131996) and the first of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar (1996\u20132000).\nIn November 2003, elections to the Generalitat gave the plurality, but not the majority of seats to CiU. Three other parties (Socialists' Party of Catalonia\u2013Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, PSC-PSOE, Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC) and Initiative for Catalonia Greens (ICV)) united to take the government into a left-wing nationalist coalition, making Pasqual Maragall, (PSC-PSOE) the new president of Catalonia. This government proved unstable, especially on the issue of reforming the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia. The Statute was approved by the Parliament of Catalonia on 30 September 2005, and subsequently it was sent to the Cortes Generales for review and discussion. They approved the law on 10 May 2006, on 18 June Catalan citizens ratified the Statute, and have been in force since 9 August 2006. The new Statute of Autonomy consolidated the self-government, and included the definition of Catalonia as a nation in the preamble. The internal tensions of Catalan Government provoked new elections, held in autumn 2006. The result was again a plurality, but not a majority, for CiU, and PSC-PSOE, ERC and ICV again formed a coalition, with Jos\u00e9 Montilla (PSC-PSOE) as president.\nOn 16 September 2005, the ICANN officially approved the domain.cat, the first domain for a language community.\nIndependence process.\nThe new Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, approved by referendum, was contested by important sectors of the Spanish nationalism and the conservative People's Party, sending the law to the partisan Constitutional Court of Spain which, in 2010, decided to declare nonvalid some of the articles that established an autonomous Catalan system of Justice, aspects of the financing, the status of the Catalan language or the references of Catalonia as a nation. As a response, on 10 July 2010, a successful demonstration was held, and the civil society started a process of organization in order to exert the right of self-determination. While the economic crisis affected profoundly Spain, CiU win the Catalan election of 2010, promising a fiscal agreement similar to the Basque. Its leader, Artur Mas, was appointed as president. Initially supported by the PP, his government carried out a program of austerity. During the National Day of Catalonia, on 11 September 2012, a massive demonstration in the streets of Barcelona organized by the organization Catalan National Assembly (\"Assemblea Nacional Catalana\", ANC) claimed for independence and a referendum of self-determination.\nOn 23 January 2013, parliament approved a Declaration on the Sovereignty and right to decide of the people of Catalonia asserting that Catalonia is a sovereign entity and calls for a referendum on independence. After the impediments of Spanish institutions, on 9 November 2014 the Government of Catalonia organized the independence referendum, in which allegedly 1.6 million out of potential 5.4 million voters or 80.8% of the 2.25 million cast votes supported the independence option (as per unofficial records).\nOn 9 November 2015, parliament approved a Declaration to start the independence process of Catalonia asserting the start of the process to create an independent Catalan state in the form of a republic.\n2017 Independence referendum.\nA controversial independence referendum was held in Catalonia on 1 October 2017, using a disputed voting process. It was declared illegal on 6 September 2017 and suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain because it breached the Spanish Constitution. Subsequently, the European Commission agreed that the referendum was illegal. The referendum asked the question: \"Do you want Catalonia to become an independent state in the form of a republic?\". More than 2,020,000 voters (91.96%) answered \"Yes\" and around 177,000 answered \"No\", on a turnout of 43.03%. The Catalan government estimated that up to 770,000 votes were not cast due to polling stations being closed off during the police crackdown, although the \"universal census\" system introduced earlier in the day allowed electors to vote in any given polling station. Catalan government officials have argued that the turnout would be higher were it not for Spanish police suppression of the vote of the illegal referendum, and that were it not for closures and police successful intervention to siege the illegal votes. Up to 770,000 votes were lost as a result of the crackdowns at police stations, the Catalan government estimated, and that were it not for closures and police pressure and disproportionate violence (it is estimated that around 1,000 people were injured during that day), turnout could have been as high as 55%. On the other hand, many voters who did not support Catalan independence did not turn out.\nCatalonia declared independence.\nThe independence motion was passed on 27 October 2017 in the Catalan assembly. The results of the parties remaining were with 70 votes in favour, 10 against and two blank ballots. Just hours after the Catalan declaration of independence, the Spanish Senate invoked Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution and authorised Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's government to impose direct rule over Catalonia. Rajoy declared the dissolution of the Catalan Parliament and dismissed Catalonia's Government, including its president, Carles Puigdemont. Rajoy called a snap Catalan parliamentary election for 21 December 2017.\nSpanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria was chosen to assume the functions of the President of Catalonia, as part of the actions that resulted after the activation of Article 155. Santamaria was vested total control over the Catalan administration in addition to being appointed president. Josep Llu\u00eds Trapero was also relieved of his duty as chief of the Catalan police force.\nOn 1 May 2018 Quim Torra was elected President of Catalonia after the Spanish courts blocked the election of Carles Puigdemont, who had the support of the Catalan Parliament after the December election; Jordi Turull, and Jordi S\u00e0nchez. Carles Puigdemont was declared non-legible after fleeing the Spanish judiciary system. Jordi S\u00e0nchez was declared non-ilegible since he was in jail awaiting trial and Jordi Turull was summoned to court and kept in jail half-way through the investiture debate.\nOn 1 June 2018 a motion of no confidence in the Spanish government was successful, and resulted in the downfall of Mariano Rajoy and in socialist leader Pedro S\u00e1nchez becoming new prime minister of Spain. Catalan nationalist parties were a key support to the downfall of Rajoy.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

For example, for a fluid flowing horizontally, Bernoulli's principle states that an increase in the speed occurs simultaneously with a decrease in pressure.Ch.3\u00a7 3.5 The principle is named after the Swiss mathematician and physicist Daniel Bernoulli, who published it in his book \"Hydrodynamica\" in 1738. Although Bernoulli deduced that pressure decreases when the flow speed increases, it was Leonhard Euler in 1752 who derived Bernoulli's equation in its usual form.\nBernoulli's principle can be derived from the principle of conservation of energy. This states that, in a steady flow, the sum of all forms of energy in a fluid is the same at all points that are free of viscous forces. This requires that the sum of kinetic energy, potential energy and internal energy remains constant.\u00a7 3.5 Thus an increase in the speed of the fluid\u2014implying an increase in its kinetic energy\u2014occurs with a simultaneous decrease in (the sum of) its potential energy (including the static pressure) and internal energy. If the fluid is flowing out of a reservoir, the sum of all forms of energy is the same because in a reservoir the energy per unit volume (the sum of pressure and gravitational potential \"\u03c1\"\u2009\"g\"\u2009\"h\") is the same everywhere.Example 3.5 and p.116\nBernoulli's principle can also be derived directly from Isaac Newton's second law of motion. When a fluid is flowing horizontally from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure, there is more pressure from behind than in front. This gives a net force on the volume, accelerating it along the streamline. \nFluid particles are subject only to pressure and their own weight. If a fluid is flowing horizontally and along a section of a streamline, where the speed increases it can only be because the fluid on that section has moved from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure; and if its speed decreases, it can only be because it has moved from a region of lower pressure to a region of higher pressure. Consequently, within a fluid flowing horizontally, the highest speed occurs where the pressure is lowest, and the lowest speed occurs where the pressure is highest.\nBernoulli's principle is only applicable for isentropic flows: when the effects of irreversible processes (like turbulence) and non-adiabatic processes (e.g. thermal radiation) are small and can be neglected. However, the principle can be applied to various types of flow within these bounds, resulting in various forms of Bernoulli's equation. The simple form of Bernoulli's equation is valid for incompressible flows (e.g. most liquid flows and gases moving at low Mach number). More advanced forms may be applied to compressible flows at higher Mach numbers.\nIncompressible flow equation.\nIn most flows of liquids, and of gases at low Mach number, the density of a fluid parcel can be considered to be constant, regardless of pressure variations in the flow. Therefore, the fluid can be considered to be incompressible, and these flows are called incompressible flows. Bernoulli performed his experiments on liquids, so his equation in its original form is valid only for incompressible flow.\nA common form of Bernoulli's equation is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere:\nBernoulli's equation and the Bernoulli constant are applicable throughout any region of flow where the energy per unit mass is uniform. Because the energy per unit mass of liquid in a well-mixed reservoir is uniform throughout, Bernoulli's equation can be used to analyze the fluid flow everywhere in that reservoir (including pipes or flow fields that the reservoir feeds) \"except\" where viscous forces dominate and erode the energy per unit mass.Example 3.5 and p.116\nThe following assumptions must be met for this Bernoulli equation to apply:265\nFor conservative force fields (not limited to the gravitational field), Bernoulli's equation can be generalized as:265\nformula_7\nwhere \u03a8 is the force potential at the point considered. For example, for the Earth's gravity \u03a8 = \"gz\".\nBy multiplying with the fluid density \u03c1, equation (A) can be rewritten as:\nformula_8\nor:\nformula_9\nwhere\nThe constant in the Bernoulli equation can be normalized. A common approach is in terms of total head or energy head H:\nformula_10\nThe above equations suggest there is a flow speed at which pressure is zero, and at even higher speeds the pressure is negative. Most often, gases and liquids are not capable of negative absolute pressure, or even zero pressure, so clearly Bernoulli's equation ceases to be valid before zero pressure is reached. In liquids\u2014when the pressure becomes too low\u2014cavitation occurs. The above equations use a linear relationship between flow speed squared and pressure. At higher flow speeds in gases, or for sound waves in liquid, the changes in mass density become significant so that the assumption of constant density is invalid.\nSimplified form.\nIn many applications of Bernoulli's equation, the change in the \u03c1gz term is so small compared with the other terms that it can be ignored. For example, in the case of aircraft in flight, the change in height z is so small the \u03c1gz term can be omitted. This allows the above equation to be presented in the following simplified form:\nformula_11\nwhere \"p\"0 is called total pressure, and q is \" dynamic pressure\". Many authors refer to the pressure p as static pressure to distinguish it from total pressure \"p\"0 and dynamic pressure q. In \"Aerodynamics\", L.J. Clancy writes: \"To distinguish it from the total and dynamic pressures, the actual pressure of the fluid, which is associated not with its motion but with its state, is often referred to as the static pressure, but where the term pressure alone is used it refers to this static pressure.\"\u00a7 3.5\nThe simplified form of Bernoulli's equation can be summarized in the following memorable word equation:\u00a7 3.5\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;Static pressure + Dynamic pressure = Total pressure.\nEvery point in a steadily flowing fluid, regardless of the fluid speed at that point, has its own unique static pressure p and dynamic pressure q. Their sum \"p\" + \"q\" is defined to be the total pressure \"p\"0. The significance of Bernoulli's principle can now be summarized as \"total pressure is constant in any region free of viscous forces\". If the fluid flow is brought to rest at some point, this point is called a stagnation point, and at this point the static pressure is equal to the stagnation pressure.\nIf the fluid flow is irrotational, the total pressure is uniform and Bernoulli's principle can be summarized as \"total pressure is constant everywhere in the fluid flow\".Equation 3.12 It is reasonable to assume that irrotational flow exists in any situation where a large body of fluid is flowing past a solid body. Examples are aircraft in flight and ships moving in open bodies of water. However, Bernoulli's principle importantly does not apply in the boundary layer such as in flow through long pipes.\nUnsteady potential flow.\nThe Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow is used in the theory of ocean surface waves and acoustics. For an irrotational flow, the flow velocity can be described as the gradient \u2207\"\u03c6\" of a velocity potential \u03c6. In that case, and for a constant density \u03c1, the momentum equations of the Euler equations can be integrated to:383formula_12\nwhich is a Bernoulli equation valid also for unsteady\u2014or time dependent\u2014flows. Here denotes the partial derivative of the velocity potential \u03c6 with respect to time t, and \"v\" = |\u2207\"\u03c6\"| is the flow speed. The function \"f\"(\"t\") depends only on time and not on position in the fluid. As a result, the Bernoulli equation at some moment t applies in the whole fluid domain. This is also true for the special case of a steady irrotational flow, in which case f and are constants so equation (A) can be applied in every point of the fluid domain.383 Further \"f\"(\"t\") can be made equal to zero by incorporating it into the velocity potential using the transformation:formula_13\nresulting in:\nformula_14\nNote that the relation of the potential to the flow velocity is unaffected by this transformation: \u2207\u03a6 = \u2207\"\u03c6\".\nThe Bernoulli equation for unsteady potential flow also appears to play a central role in Luke's variational principle, a variational description of free-surface flows using the Lagrangian mechanics.\nCompressible flow equation.\nBernoulli developed his principle from observations on liquids, and Bernoulli's equation is valid for ideal fluids: those that are inviscid, incompressible and subjected only to conservative forces. It is sometimes valid for the flow of gases as well, provided that there is no transfer of kinetic or potential energy from the gas flow to the compression or expansion of the gas. If both the gas pressure and volume change simultaneously, then work will be done on or by the gas. In this case, Bernoulli's equation in its incompressible flow form cannot be assumed to be valid. However, if the gas process is entirely isobaric, or isochoric, then no work is done on or by the gas (so the simple energy balance is not upset). According to the gas law, an isobaric or isochoric process is ordinarily the only way to ensure constant density in a gas. Also the gas density will be proportional to the ratio of pressure and absolute temperature; however, this ratio will vary upon compression or expansion, no matter what non-zero quantity of heat is added or removed. The only exception is if the net heat transfer is zero, as in a complete thermodynamic cycle or in an individual isentropic (frictionless adiabatic) process, and even then this reversible process must be reversed, to restore the gas to the original pressure and specific volume, and thus density. Only then is the original, unmodified Bernoulli equation applicable. In this case the equation can be used if the flow speed of the gas is sufficiently below the speed of sound, such that the variation in density of the gas (due to this effect) along each streamline can be ignored. Adiabatic flow at less than Mach 0.3 is generally considered to be slow enough.\nIt is possible to use the fundamental principles of physics to develop similar equations applicable to compressible fluids. There are numerous equations, each tailored for a particular application, but all are analogous to Bernoulli's equation and all rely on nothing more than the fundamental principles of physics such as Newton's laws of motion or the first law of thermodynamics.\nCompressible flow in fluid dynamics.\nFor a compressible fluid, with a barotropic equation of state, and under the action of conservative forces,\nformula_15\nwhere:\nIn engineering situations, elevations are generally small compared to the size of the Earth, and the time scales of fluid flow are small enough to consider the equation of state as adiabatic. In this case, the above equation for an ideal gas becomes:\u00a7 3.11\nformula_16\nwhere, in addition to the terms listed above:\nIn many applications of compressible flow, changes in elevation are negligible compared to the other terms, so the term gz can be omitted. A very useful form of the equation is then:\nformula_17\nwhere:\nCompressible flow in thermodynamics.\nThe most general form of the equation, suitable for use in thermodynamics in case of (quasi) steady flow, is:\u00a7 3.5\u00a7 5\u00a7 5.9\nformula_18\nHere w is the enthalpy per unit mass (also known as specific enthalpy), which is also often written as h (not to be confused with \"head\" or \"height\").\nNote that\nformula_19\nwhere e is the thermodynamic energy per unit mass, also known as the specific internal energy. So, for constant internal energy formula_20 the equation reduces to the incompressible-flow form.\nThe constant on the right-hand side is often called the Bernoulli constant and denoted b. For steady inviscid adiabatic flow with no additional sources or sinks of energy, b is constant along any given streamline. More generally, when b may vary along streamlines, it still proves a useful parameter, related to the \"head\" of the fluid (see below).\nWhen the change in \u03a8 can be ignored, a very useful form of this equation is:\nformula_21\nwhere \"w\"0 is total enthalpy. For a calorically perfect gas such as an ideal gas, the enthalpy is directly proportional to the temperature, and this leads to the concept of the total (or stagnation) temperature.\nWhen shock waves are present, in a reference frame in which the shock is stationary and the flow is steady, many of the parameters in the Bernoulli equation suffer abrupt changes in passing through the shock. The Bernoulli parameter remains unaffected. An exception to this rule is radiative shocks, which violate the assumptions leading to the Bernoulli equation, namely the lack of additional sinks or sources of energy.\nUnsteady potential flow.\nFor a compressible fluid, with a barotropic equation of state, the unsteady momentum conservation equation\nformula_22\nWith the irrotational assumption, namely, the flow velocity can be described as the gradient \u2207\"\u03c6\" of a velocity potential \"\u03c6\". The unsteady momentum conservation equation becomes\nformula_23\nwhich leads to\nformula_24\nIn this case, the above equation for isentropic flow becomes:\nformula_25\nDerivations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids\nThe Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids can be derived by either integrating Newton's second law of motion or by applying the law of conservation of energy, ignoring viscosity, compressibility, and thermal effects.\nThe simplest derivation is to first ignore gravity and consider constrictions and expansions in pipes that are otherwise straight, as seen in Venturi effect. Let the x axis be directed down the axis of the pipe.\nDefine a parcel of fluid moving through a pipe with cross-sectional area A, the length of the parcel is d\"x\", and the volume of the parcel \"A\" d\"x\". If mass density is \u03c1, the mass of the parcel is density multiplied by its volume \"m\" = \"\u03c1A\" d\"x\". The change in pressure over distance d\"x\" is d\"p\" and flow velocity \"v\" =.\nApply Newton's second law of motion (force\u00a0= mass\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0acceleration) and recognizing that the effective force on the parcel of fluid is \u2212\"A\" d\"p\". If the pressure decreases along the length of the pipe, d\"p\" is negative but the force resulting in flow is positive along the x axis.\nformula_26\nIn steady flow the velocity field is constant with respect to time, \"v\" = \"v\"(\"x\") = \"v\"(\"x\"(\"t\")), so v itself is not directly a function of time t. It is only when the parcel moves through x that the cross sectional area changes: v depends on t only through the cross-sectional position \"x\"(\"t\").\nformula_27\nWith density \u03c1 constant, the equation of motion can be written as\nformula_28\nby integrating with respect to x\nformula_29\nwhere C is a constant, sometimes referred to as the Bernoulli constant. It is not a universal constant, but rather a constant of a particular fluid system. The deduction is: where the speed is large, pressure is low and vice versa.\nIn the above derivation, no external work\u2013energy principle is invoked. Rather, Bernoulli's principle was derived by a simple manipulation of Newton's second law.\nAnother way to derive Bernoulli's principle for an incompressible flow is by applying conservation of energy. In the form of the work-energy theorem, stating that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\"the change in the kinetic energy \"\"E\"kin\" of the system equals the net work W done on the system\"; formula_30\nTherefore,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt; \"the work done by the forces in the fluid equals increase in kinetic energy.\"\nThe system consists of the volume of fluid, initially between the cross-sections \"A\"1 and \"A\"2. In the time interval \u0394\"t\" fluid elements initially at the inflow cross-section \"A\"1 move over a distance \"s\"1 = \"v\"1 \u0394\"t\", while at the outflow cross-section the fluid moves away from cross-section \"A\"2 over a distance \"s\"2 = \"v\"2 \u0394\"t\". The displaced fluid volumes at the inflow and outflow are respectively \"A\"1\"s\"1 and \"A\"2\"s\"2. The associated displaced fluid masses are \u2013 when \u03c1 is the fluid's mass density \u2013 equal to density times volume, so \"\u03c1A\"1\"s\"1 and \"\u03c1A\"2\"s\"2. By mass conservation, these two masses displaced in the time interval \u0394\"t\" have to be equal, and this displaced mass is denoted by\u00a0\u0394\"m\":\nformula_31\nThe work done by the forces consists of two parts:\nformula_33\nNow, the work by the force of gravity is opposite to the change in potential energy, \"W\"gravity = \u2212\"\u0394E\"pot,gravity: while the force of gravity is in the negative z-direction, the work\u2014gravity force times change in elevation\u2014will be negative for a positive elevation change \u0394\"z\" = \"z\"2 \u2212 \"z\"1, while the corresponding potential energy change is positive.14\u20134,&amp;hairsp;\u00a714\u20133 So: formula_34\nAnd therefore the total work done in this time interval \u0394\"t\" is\nformula_35\nThe \"increase in kinetic energy\" is\nformula_36\nPutting these together, the work-kinetic energy theorem \"W\" = \u0394\"E\"kin gives:\nformula_37\nor\nformula_38\nAfter dividing by the mass \u0394\"m\" = \"\u03c1A\"1\"v\"1 \u0394\"t\" = \"\u03c1A\"2\"v\"2 \u0394\"t\" the result is:\nformula_39\nor, as stated in the first paragraph:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther division by g produces the following equation. Note that each term can be described in the length dimension (such as meters). This is the head equation derived from Bernoulli's principle:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe middle term, z, represents the potential energy of the fluid due to its elevation with respect to a reference plane. Now, z is called the elevation head and given the designation \"z\"elevation.\nA free falling mass from an elevation \"z\" &gt; 0 (in a vacuum) will reach a speed\nformula_40\nwhen arriving at elevation \"z\" = 0. Or when rearranged as \"head\":\nformula_41\nThe term is called the \"velocity head\", expressed as a length measurement. It represents the internal energy of the fluid due to its motion.\nThe hydrostatic pressure \"p\" is defined as\nformula_42\nwith \"p\"0 some reference pressure, or when rearranged as \"head\":\nformula_43\nThe term is also called the \"pressure head\", expressed as a length measurement. It represents the internal energy of the fluid due to the pressure exerted on the container. The head due to the flow speed and the head due to static pressure combined with the elevation above a reference plane, a simple relationship useful for incompressible fluids using the velocity head, elevation head, and pressure head is obtained.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf Eqn. 1 is multiplied by the density of the fluid, an equation with three pressure terms is obtained:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNote that the pressure of the system is constant in this form of the Bernoulli equation. If the static pressure of the system (the third term) increases, and if the pressure due to elevation (the middle term) is constant, then the dynamic pressure (the first term) must have decreased. In other words, if the speed of a fluid decreases and it is not due to an elevation difference, it must be due to an increase in the static pressure that is resisting the flow.\nAll three equations are merely simplified versions of an energy balance on a system.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Math_proof/styles.css\" /&gt;Bernoulli equation for compressible fluids\nThe derivation for compressible fluids is similar. Again, the derivation depends upon (1) conservation of mass, and (2) conservation of energy. Conservation of mass implies that in the above figure, in the interval of time \u0394\"t\", the amount of mass passing through the boundary defined by the area \"A\"1 is equal to the amount of mass passing outwards through the boundary defined by the area \"A\"2:\nformula_44\nConservation of energy is applied in a similar manner: It is assumed that the change in energy of the volume\nof the streamtube bounded by \"A\"1 and \"A\"2 is due entirely to energy entering or leaving through one or the other of these two boundaries. Clearly, in a more complicated situation such as a fluid flow coupled with radiation, such conditions are not met. Nevertheless, assuming this to be the case and assuming the flow is steady so that the net change in the energy is zero,\nformula_45\nwhere \u0394\"E\"1 and \u0394\"E\"2 are the energy entering through \"A\"1 and leaving through \"A\"2, respectively. The energy entering through \"A\"1 is the sum of the kinetic energy entering, the energy entering in the form of potential gravitational energy of the fluid, the fluid thermodynamic internal energy per unit of mass (\"\u03b5\"1) entering, and the energy entering in the form of mechanical \"p\" d\"V\" work:\nformula_46\nwhere \"\u03a8\" = \"gz\" is a force potential due to the Earth's gravity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and z is elevation above a reference plane. A similar expression for \u0394\"E\"2 may easily be constructed.\nSo now setting 0 = \u0394\"E\"1 \u2212 \u0394\"E\"2:\nformula_47\nwhich can be rewritten as:\nformula_48\nNow, using the previously-obtained result from conservation of mass, this may be simplified to obtain\nformula_49\nwhich is the Bernoulli equation for compressible flow.\nAn equivalent expression can be written in terms of fluid enthalpy (h):\nformula_50\nApplications.\nIn modern everyday life there are many observations that can be successfully explained by application of Bernoulli's principle, even though no real fluid is entirely inviscid, and a small viscosity often has a large effect on the flow.\nMisconceptions.\nAirfoil lift.\nOne of the most common erroneous explanations of aerodynamic lift asserts that the air must traverse the upper and lower surfaces of a wing in the same amount of time, implying that since the upper surface presents a longer path the air must be moving over the top of the wing faster than over the bottom. Bernoulli's principle is then cited to conclude that the pressure on top of the wing must be lower than on the bottom.\nEqual transit time applies to the flow around a body generating no lift, but there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time in cases of bodies generating lift. In fact, theory predicts \u2013 and experiments confirm \u2013 that the air traverses the top surface of a body experiencing lift in a \"shorter\" time than it traverses the bottom surface; the explanation based on equal transit time is false. While the equal-time explanation is false, it is not the Bernoulli principle that is false, because this principle is well established; Bernoulli's equation is used correctly in common mathematical treatments of aerodynamic lift.\nCommon classroom demonstrations.\nThere are several common classroom demonstrations that are sometimes incorrectly explained using Bernoulli's principle. One involves holding a piece of paper horizontally so that it droops downward and then blowing over the top of it. As the demonstrator blows over the paper, the paper rises. It is then asserted that this is because \"faster moving air has lower pressure\".\nOne problem with this explanation can be seen by blowing along the bottom of the paper: if the deflection was caused by faster moving air, then the paper should deflect downward; but the paper deflects upward regardless of whether the faster moving air is on the top or the bottom. Another problem is that when the air leaves the demonstrator's mouth it has the \"same\" pressure as the surrounding air; the air does not have lower pressure just because it is moving; in the demonstration, the static pressure of the air leaving the demonstrator's mouth is \"equal\" to the pressure of the surrounding air. A third problem is that it is false to make a connection between the flow on the two sides of the paper using Bernoulli's equation since the air above and below are \"different\" flow fields and Bernoulli's principle only applies within a flow field.\nAs the wording of the principle can change its implications, stating the principle correctly is important. What Bernoulli's principle actually says is that within a flow of constant energy, when fluid flows through a region of lower pressure it speeds up and vice versa. Thus, Bernoulli's principle concerns itself with \"changes\" in speed and \"changes\" in pressure \"within\" a flow field. It cannot be used to compare different flow fields.\nA correct explanation of why the paper rises would observe that the plume follows the curve of the paper and that a curved streamline will develop a pressure gradient perpendicular to the direction of flow, with the lower pressure on the inside of the curve. Bernoulli's principle predicts that the decrease in pressure is associated with an increase in speed; in other words, as the air passes over the paper, it speeds up and moves faster than it was moving when it left the demonstrator's mouth. But this is not apparent from the demonstration.\nOther common classroom demonstrations, such as blowing between two suspended spheres, inflating a large bag, or suspending a ball in an airstream are sometimes explained in a similarly misleading manner by saying \"faster moving air has lower pressure\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64221", "revid": "38415975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64221", "title": "Biorhythm (pseudoscience)", "text": "Dubious idea about physiological cycles\nThe biorhythm theory is the pseudoscientific idea that peoples' daily lives are significantly affected by rhythmic cycles with periods of exactly 23, 28 and 33 days, typically a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle. The idea was developed by German otolaryngologist Wilhelm Fliess in the late 19th century, and was popularized in the United States in the late 1970s. The proposal has been independently tested and, consistently, no validity for it has been found.\nAccording to the notion of biorhythms, a person's life is influenced by rhythmic biological cycles that affect their ability in various domains, such as mental, physical, and emotional activity. These cycles begin at birth and oscillate in a steady (sine wave) fashion throughout life, and by modeling them mathematically, it is suggested that a person's level of ability in each of these domains can be predicted from day to day. It is built on the idea that the biofeedback chemical and hormonal secretion functions within the body could show a sinusoidal behavior over time.\nMost biorhythm models use three cycles: a 23-day physical cycle, a 28-day emotional cycle, and a 33-day intellectual cycle. These cycles are to be adjusted based on the person's personal day clock which may run from 22 hours to 27 hours although 23-25 is the norm. Two ways one can find their personal day clock is to test one's grip and body temperature every 15 minutes for a few days or the same time each day for a few months. Although the 28-day cycle is the same length as the average woman's menstrual cycle and was originally described as a \"female\" cycle (see below), the two are not necessarily in synchronization. Each of these cycles varies between high and low extremes sinusoidally, with days where the cycle crosses the zero line described as \"critical days\" of greater risk or uncertainty.\nThe numbers from +100% (maximum) to -100% (minimum) indicate where on each cycle the rhythms are on a particular day. In general, a rhythm at 0% is crossing the midpoint and is thought to have no real impact on one's life, whereas a rhythm at +100% (at the peak of that cycle) would give one an edge in that area, and a rhythm at -100% (at the bottom of that cycle) would make life more difficult in that area. There is no particular meaning to a day on which one's rhythms are all high or all low, except the obvious benefits or hindrances that these rare extremes are thought to have on one's life.\nIn addition to the three popular cycles, various other cycles have been proposed, based on linear combination of the three, or on longer or shorter rhythms.\nCalculation.\nTheories published state the equations for the cycles as:\nwhere formula_4 indicates the number of days since birth. Basic arithmetic shows that the combination of the simpler 23- and 28-day cycles repeats every 644 days (or 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 years), while the triple combination of 23-, 28-, and 33-day cycles repeats every 21,252 days (or 58.18+ years).\nHistory.\nThe 23- and 28-day rhythms used by biorhythmists were first devised in the late 19th century by Wilhelm Fliess, a Berlin physician and friend of Sigmund Freud. Fliess believed that he observed regularities at 23- and 28-day intervals in a number of phenomena, including births and deaths. He labeled the 23-day rhythm \"male\" and the 28-day rhythm \"female\", matching the menstrual cycle.\nIn 1904, Viennese psychology professor Hermann Swoboda came to similar conclusions. Alfred Teltscher, professor of engineering at the University of Innsbruck, developed Swoboda's work and suggested that his students' good and bad days followed a rhythmic pattern; he believed that the brain's ability to absorb, mental ability, and alertness ran in 33-day cycles. One of the first academic researchers of biorhythms was Estonian-born Nikolai P\u00e4rna, who published a book in German called \"Rhythm, Life and Creation\" in 1923.\nThe practice of consulting biorhythms was popularized in the 1970s by a series of books by Bernard Gittelson, including \"Biorhythm\u2014A Personal Science\", \"Biorhythm Charts of the Famous and Infamous\", and \"Biorhythm Sports Forecasting\". Gittelson's company, Biorhythm Computers, Inc., made a business selling personal biorhythm charts and calculators, but his ability to predict sporting events was not substantiated.\nCharting biorhythms for personal use was popular in the United States during the 1970s; many places (especially video arcades and amusement areas) had a biorhythm machine that provided charts upon entry of date of birth. Biorhythm programs were a common application on personal computers; and in the late 1970s, there were also handheld biorhythm calculators on the market, the \"Kosmos 1\" and the Casio \"Biolator\".\nCritical views.\nThere have been some three dozen published studies of biorhythm theory, but according to a study by Terence Hines, all of those either supported the null hypothesis that there is no correlation of human experience and the supposed biorhythms beyond what can be explained by coincidence, or, in cases where authors claimed to have evidence for biorhythm theory, methodological and statistical errors invalidated their conclusions. Hines therefore concluded that the theory is not valid.\nSupporters continued to defend the theory in spite of the lack of corroborating scientific evidence, leading to the charge that it had become a kind of pseudoscience due to its proponents' rejection of empirical testing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;An examination of some 134 biorhythm studies found that the theory is not valid (Hines, 1998). It is empirically testable and has been shown to be false. Terence Hines believes that this fact implies that biorhythm theory 'can not be properly termed a pseudoscientific theory'. However, when the advocates of an empirically testable theory refuse to give up the theory in the face of overwhelming evidence against it, it seems reasonable to call the theory pseudoscientific. For, in fact, the adherents to such a theory have declared by their behaviour that there is nothing that could falsify it, yet they continue to claim the theory is scientific. (from Carroll's \"The Skeptic's Dictionary\")\nThe physiologist Gordon Stein in the book \"Encyclopedia of Hoaxes\" (1993) wrote:Both the theoretical underpinning and the practical scientific verification of biorhythm theory are lacking. Without those, biorhythms became just another pseudoscientific claim that people are willing to accept without required evidence. Those pushing biorhythm calculators and books on a gullible public are guilty of making fraudulent claims. They are hoaxers of the public if they know what they are saying has no factual justification.A 1978 study of the incidence of industrial accidents found neither empirical nor theoretical support for the biorhythm model.\nIn Underwood Dudley's book, \"Numerology: Or What Pythagoras Wrought\", he provides an example of a situation in which a magician provides a woman her biorhythm chart that supposedly included the next two years of her life. The women sent letters to the magician describing how accurate the chart was. The magician purposely sent her a biorhythm chart based on a different birthdate. After he explained that he sent the wrong chart to her, he sent her another chart, also having the wrong birthdate. She then said that this new chart was even more accurate than the previous one. This kind of willful credulous belief in vague or inaccurate prognostication derives from motivated reasoning backed up by fallacious acceptance of confirmation bias, post hoc rationalization, and suggestibility.\nWilhelm Fliess \"was able to impose his number patterns on virtually everything\" and worked to convince others that cycles happen within men and women every 23 and 28 days. Mathematically, Fliess's equation, n = 23x +28y is unconstrained as there are infinitely many solutions for x and y, meaning that Fliess and Sigmund Freud (who adopted this idea in the early 1890s) could predict anything they wanted with the combination.\nThe skeptical evaluations of the various biorhythm proposals led to a number of critiques lambasting the subject published in the 1970s and 1980s. Biorhythm advocates who objected to the takedowns claimed that because circadian rhythms had been empirically verified in many organisms' sleep cycles, biorhythms were just as plausible. However, unlike biorhythms, which are claimed to have precise and unaltering periods, circadian rhythms are found by observing the cycle itself and the periods are found to vary in length based on biological and environmental factors. Assuming such factors were relevant to biorhythms would result in chaotic cycle combinations that remove any \"predictive\" features.\nAdditional studies.\nSeveral controlled, experimental studies found no correlation between the 23, 28 and 33 day cycles and academic performance. These studies include:\nJames (1984).\nJames hypothesized that if biorhythms were rooted in science, then each proposed biorhythm cycle would contribute to task performance. Further, he predicted that each type of biorhythm cycle (i.e., intellectual, physical, and emotional) would be most influential on tasks associated with the corresponding cycle type. For example, he postulated that intellectual biorhythm cycles would be most influential on academic testing performance. In order to test his hypotheses, James observed 368 participants, noting their performance on tasks associated with intellectual, physical, and emotional functioning. Based on data collected from his experimental research, James concluded that there was no relation between subjects' biorhythmic status (on any of the three cycle types), and their performance on the associated practical tests.\nPeveto (1980).\nPeveto examined the proposed relationship between biorhythms and academic performance, specifically in terms of reading ability. Through examination of the data collected, Peveto concluded that there were no significant differences in the academic performance of the students, in regards to reading, during the high, low, or critical positions of neither the physical biorhythm cycle, the emotional biorhythm cycle, nor the intellectual biorhythm cycle. As a result, it was concluded that biorhythm cycles have no effect on the academic performance of students, when academic performance was measured using reading ability.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

His historicity is attested by many classical authors, among them Aristotle, Pausanias, Cicero, Herodotus, Vitruvius, Epictetus, and the author of the \"Suda\", but there are many legendary stories surrounding him.\nDiodorus Siculus wrote in his history that Milo was a follower of Pythagoras who commanded the Crotonian army which defeated the Sybarites in 511 BC, while wearing his Olympic wreaths and dressed like Heracles in a lion's skin and carrying a club:\nMilo's death, said to have occurred by wolves or a lion whilst his fingers were trapped in a tree stump he was trying to help someone split, became a popular subject in art in late Italian Renaissance sculpture; it continued to around 1900 and allowed the sculptor to show his skill in a dramatic anatomical pose, being a more compact equivalent of the Roman \"Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons\".\nFeats of strength.\nAncient sources and legends report that Milo took great pleasure in showing off his strength. He had a number of feats he would perform, such as holding out his arm with his fingers outstretched and challenging people to attempt to bend his little finger, standing on a greased iron disk and challenging people to push him off it, and holding a pomegranate in one hand and challenging others to take it from him; nobody ever succeeded, and the fruit was never damaged despite him holding it very tightly.\nIn what would become his most famous feat of strength, Milo trained in the off-years by carrying a newborn calf on his back every day until the Olympics took place, by which time he would be carrying a four-year-old cow on his back; he then carried the adult cow the length of the stadium before killing, roasting, and eating it.\nDeath.\nLegend has it that Milo's penchant for showing off his strength was his eventual undoing. In 511 BC, he traveled the countryside and met a villager who was struggling to split a tree stump with a hammer and wedges. Milo excitedly asked the man if he could attempt to split the wood with his bare hands; the villager, honored by his offer, went off to get food while Milo worked. Milo immediately tried to pull the stump apart by inserting his fingers in the crack where the villager had driven the wedges, but as he pulled the stump open, the wedges fell out and trapped his fingers. Without the wedges to hold the crack open, Milo could not free his fingers from the stump, and instead opted to wait for the villager to return. The legend says that Milo, unable to defend himself, was then killed by wolves or a lion before the villager returned.\nStatue.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The statue of Milo the son of Diotimus was made by Dameas, also a native of Crotona. Milo won six victories for wrestling at Olympia, one of them among the boys; at Pytho he won six among the men and one among the boys. He came to Olympia to wrestle for the seventh time, but did not succeed in mastering Timasitheus, a fellow-citizen who was also a young man, and who refused, moreover, to come to close quarters with him. It is further stated that Milo carried his own statue into the Altis. His feats with the pomegranate and the quoit are also remembered by tradition. He would grasp a pomegranate so firmly that nobody could wrest it from him by force, and yet he did not damage it by pressure. He would stand upon a greased quoit, and make fools of those who charged him and tried to push him from the quoit. He used to perform also the following exhibition feats. He would tie a cord round his forehead as though it were a ribbon or a crown. Holding his breath and filling with blood the veins on his head, he would break the cord by the strength of these veins. It is said that he would let down by his side his right arm from the shoulder to the elbow, and stretch out straight the arm below the elbow, turning the thumb upwards, while the other fingers lay in a row. In this position, then, the little finger was lowest, but nobody could bend it back by pressure. They say that he was killed by wild beasts. The story has it that he came across in the land of Crotona a tree-trunk that was drying up; wedges were inserted to keep the trunk apart. Milo in his pride thrust his hands into the trunk, the wedges slipped, and Milo was held fast by the trunk until the wolves\u2014a beast that roves in vast packs in the land of Crotona\u2014made him their prey. Such was the fate that overtook Milo.\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64223", "revid": "50755775", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64223", "title": "Powerlifting", "text": "Sport\nPowerlifting is a competitive strength sport that consists of three attempts at maximal weight on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. As in the sport of Olympic weightlifting, it involves the athlete attempting a maximal weight single-lift effort of a barbell loaded with weight plates. Powerlifting evolved from a sport known as \"odd lifts\", which followed the same three-attempt format but used a wider variety of events, akin to strongman competition. Eventually, odd lifts became standardized to the current three.\nIn competition, lifts may be performed equipped or unequipped (typically referred to as 'classic' or 'raw' lifting in the IPF specifically). Equipment in this context refers to a supportive bench shirt or squat/deadlift suit or briefs. In some federations, knee wraps are permitted in the equipped but not unequipped division; in others, they may be used in both equipped and unequipped lifting. Weightlifting belts, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and special footwear may also be used, but are not considered when distinguishing equipped from unequipped lifting.\nCompetitions take place across the world. Powerlifting has been a Paralympic sport (bench press only) since 1984 and, under the IPF, is also a World Games sport. Local, national and international competitions have also been sanctioned by other federations operating independently of the IPF.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe roots of powerlifting are found in traditions of strength training stretching back as far as the ancient Mayan civilizations and ancient Persian times. The idea of powerlifting originated in ancient Greece, as men lifted stones to prove their strength and manhood. The modern sport originated in the United Kingdom and the United States in the 1950s. Previously, the weightlifting governing bodies in both countries had recognized various \"odd lifts\" for competition and record purposes. During the 1950s, Olympic weightlifting declined in the United States, while strength sports gained many new followers. People did not like the Olympic lifts Clean and Press, Snatch and Clean and Jerk. In 1958, the National Weightlifting Committee of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) decided to begin recognizing records for odd lifts. The first national competition was held in September 1964 under the auspices of the York Barbell Company. York Barbell owner Bob Hoffman had been a longtime adversary of the sport, but his company was now making powerlifting equipment to make up for the sales it had lost on Olympic equipment.\nDuring the late 1950s, Hoffman's influence on Olympic lifting and his predominately Olympics-focused magazine \"Strength and Health\" were beginning to come under increasing pressure from Joe Weider's organization. In order to combat the growing influence of Weider, Hoffman started another magazine, \"Muscular Development\", which would be focused more on bodybuilding and the fast-growing interest in odd lift competitions. The magazine's first editor was John Grimek. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, various odd lift events gradually developed into the specific lifts of the bench press, squat, and deadlift, and were lifted in that order. Hoffman became more and more influential in the development of this new lifting sport and organized the Weightlifting Tournament of America in 1964, effectively the first USA National championships. In 1965, the first named USA National Championships were held. During the same period, lifting in Britain also had factions. In the late 1950s, because members of the ruling body (BAWLA, the British Amateur Weight Lifters' Association) were only interested in the development of Olympic lifting, a breakaway organization called the Society of Amateur Weightlifters had been formed to cater for the interests of lifters who were not particularly interested in Olympic lifting.\nAlthough at that time there were 42 recognized lifts, the \"Strength Set\" (biceps curl, bench press, and squat) soon became the standard competition lifts, and both organizations held Championships on these lifts (as well as on the Olympic lifts) until 1965. In 1966, the Society of Amateur Weightlifters rejoined BAWLA. The bicep curl was replaced with the deadlift to fall in line with the American lifts. The first British Championship was held in 1966. During the late 1960s and at the beginning of the 1970s, various international contests were held. At the same time, in early November of each year and to commemorate Hoffman's birthday, a prestigious lifting contest was held. In 1971, it was decided to make this event the \"World Weightlifting Championships\". The event was held at 10 AM on 6 November 1971, in York, Pennsylvania. Most of the athletes were American lifters, since teams were not formed yet. There were also four British athletes, and one athlete from Jamaica. All of the referees were American. Weights were in pounds. The lifting order was \"rising bar\", and the first lift was the bench press. There was no such thing as a bench shirt or squat suit, and various interpretations were held regarding the use and length of knee wraps and weightlifting belts. The IPF rules system did not exist yet, nor had world records been established.\nIn 1972, the second AAU World Championships were held on 10 and 11 November. There were eight athletes from Great Britain, six from Canada, six from Puerto Rico, three from Zambia, and one from the West Indies. With 67 lifters in total, 47 athletes were Americans. Lifts were measured in pounds, and the bench press was the first lift.\nIPF and after.\nThe International Powerlifting Federation was formed in November of 1972. The inaugural IPF World Championships was held in York on November of 1973. There were 47 entrants: one Swedish athlete, one Puerto Rican athlete, two Canadian athletes, one West Indian athlete, eight British athletes, and 34 American athletes. 1974 was the first time that teams were selected in advance, as well as the inclusion of the 52 kilogram weight class. In 1975, the World Championships was held outside America for the first time, at the town hall in Birmingham, hosted by Vic Mercer.\nThe establishment of the IPF in 1973 spurred the establishment of the EPF (European Powerlifting Federation) in May 1977. Since it was closely associated with bodybuilding and women had been competing as bodybuilders for years, powerlifting was opened to them. The first U.S. national championships for women were held in 1978. The IPF added women's competition in 1980. In the US, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 required that each Olympic or potential Olympic sport must have its own national governing body by November 1980. As a result, the AAU lost control of every amateur sport. The USPF was founded in 1980 as the new national governing body for American powerlifting. In 1981, the American Drug Free Powerlifting Association (ADFPA), led by Brother Bennett, became the first federation to break away from the USPF, citing the need to implement effective drug testing in the sport. In 1982, drug testing was introduced to the IPF, although the USPF championships that year did not have drug testing.\nThe IPF's push for drug testing was resisted by several American lifters. In 1982, Larry Pacifico and Ernie Frantz founded the American Powerlifting Federation (APF), which advertised its categorical opposition to all drug testing.\nIn 1984, powerlifting was included into the Paralympic Games for men with spinal cord injuries. At the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney, women were invited to participate in powerlifting. Both men and women are allowed to compete in 10 weight classes respectively.\nIn 1987, the American Powerlifting Association (APA) and World Powerlifting Alliance (WPA) were formed by Scott Taylor. The APA offer both drug tested and untested categories in most of their competitions. As of 2024, the WPA has over 60 affiliate nations.\nThe USPF failed to conform to IPF demands and was expelled from the international body in 1997, with the ADFPA, now named USA Powerlifting (USAPL), taking its place (now replaced by Powerlifting America). Despite the trend towards federations, each with their own rules and standards of performance, some powerlifters have attempted to bring unity to the sport. For example, 100% RAW promoted unequipped competition and merged with another federation, Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU), in 2013. The Revolution Powerlifting Syndicate (RPS), founded by Gene Rychlak in 2011, was considered a move towards unity, as the RPS breaks the tradition of charging lifters membership fees to a specific federation in addition to entry fees for each competition. Some meet promoters have sought to bring together top lifters from different federations, outside existing federations' hierarchy of local, regional, national and international meets; a prominent example of this is the Raw Unity Meet (RUM), held annually since 2007.\nDevelopments in equipment and rules.\nAs new equipment was developed, it came to distinguish powerlifting federations from one another. Weightlifting belts and knee wraps (originally simple Ace bandages) predated powerlifting, but in 1983 John Inzer invented the first piece of equipment distinct to powerlifters\u2014the bench shirt. Bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits (operating on the same principle) became ubiquitous in powerlifting, but only some federations adopted the latest and most supportive canvas, denim, and multiply polyester designs, while others such as the IPF maintained more restrictive rules on which supportive equipment could be used. The Monolift, a rack in which the bar catchers swing out and eliminate the walkout portion of the squat, was invented by Ray Madden and first used in competition in 1992. This innovation was adopted by some federations and forbidden in others. Other inventions included specialized squat bars and deadlift bars, moving away from the IPF standard of using the same bar for all three lifts.\nThe rules of powerlifting have also evolved and differentiated. For example, in ADFPA/USAPL competition, the \"press\" command on the bench press was used, not used, and then used again, following a 2006 IPF motion to reinstate this rule. IPF rules also mandate a \"start\" command at the beginning of the bench press. Many other federations, for example, the Natural Athlete Strength Association (NASA), have never used the \"start\" command. As a further example of diversifying rules of performance, in 2011 the Southern Powerlifting Federation (SPF) eliminated the \"squat\" command at the beginning of the squat. Most federations also now allow the sumo deadlift, which the athletes foot position is outside their grip position. Many communities and federations do not class the sumo variation as a technical deadlift. Another rule change into effect from the IPF, is the bench press elbow depth rule, established in 2022 and into effect at the start of 2023. This rule, similar to squat depth, requires the bottom surface of the elbows to be in line with or below the top surface of the shoulder joint.\nSupportive equipment.\nIn powerlifting, supportive equipment refers to supportive shirts, briefs, suits, and sometimes knee wraps made of materials that store elastic potential energy and thereby assist the three lifts contested in powerlifting. Some federations allow single-ply knee sleeves, and wraps for wrists in raw competition. Straps are also used in deadlift training in case of a weak grip, but are not allowed by any federations in official competitions. A weight lifting belt is the only supportive equipment that is allowed by all federations in raw competition. The use of supportive equipment distinguishes 'equipped' and 'unequipped' (also known as 'raw') divisions in the sport, and 'equipped' and 'unequipped' records in the competition lifts. The wide differences between equipped and unequipped records in the squat and bench press suggest that supportive equipment confers a substantial advantage to lifters in these disciplines. This is less evident in the case of the deadlift, where the lack of an eccentric component to the lift minimizes how much elastic energy can be stored in a supportive suit. Supportive equipment should not be confused with the equipment on which the lifts are performed, such as a bench press bench, or conventional or monolift stand for squat or the barbell and discs. Chalk is commonly used by lifters to dry the hands to reduce blisters, slipping and improve grip strength, as the contents of the chalk is made out of magnesium carbonate. Chalk can also be added to the shoulders for squatting, on the back for bench pressing to reduce sliding, and on the hands to grip the barbell on the bench press and deadlift.\nPrinciples of operation.\nSupportive equipment is used to increase the weight lifted in powerlifting exercises. A snug garment is worn over a joint or joints (such as the shoulders or hips). This garment deforms during the downward portion of a bench press or squat, or the descent to the bar in the deadlift, storing elastic potential energy. On the upward portion of each lift, the elastic potential energy is transferred to the barbell as kinetic energy, aiding in the completion of the lift. Some claim that supportive equipment prevents injuries by compressing and stabilizing the joints over which it worn. For example, the bench shirt is claimed to support and protect the shoulders. Critics point out that the greater weights used with supportive equipment and the equipment's tendency to change the pattern of the movement may compromise safety, as in the case of the bar moving towards the head during the upward portion of the shirted bench press.\nSquat suit material and construction.\nDifferent materials are used in the construction of supportive equipment. Squat suits may be made of varying types of polyester, or of canvas. The latter fabric is less elastic, and therefore considered to provide greater 'stopping power' at the bottom of the movement but less assistance with the ascent. Bench shirts may be made of polyester or denim, where the denim again provides a less-elastic alternative to the polyester. Knee wraps are made of varying combinations of cotton and elastic. Supportive equipment can be constructed in different ways to suit the lifters' preferences. A squat suit may be constructed for a wide or a narrow stance; and a bench shirt may be constructed with 'straight' sleeves (perpendicular to the trunk of the lifter) or sleeves that are angled towards the abdomen. The back of the bench shirt may be closed or open, and the back panel may or may not be of the same material as the front of the shirt. Similarly, 'hybrid' squat suits can include panels made from canvas and polyester, in an effort to combine the strengths of each material. When two or more panels overlay one another in a piece of supportive equipment, that equipment is described as 'multi-ply', in contrast to 'single-ply' equipment made of one layer of material throughout.\nRaw powerlifting.\nRaw powerlifting, also called classic or unequipped powerlifting has been codified in response to the proliferation and advancement of bench shirts and squat/deadlift suits. The 100% RAW federation was founded in 1999; within a decade, many established federations came to recognize \"raw\" divisions, in addition to their traditional (open) divisions permitting single-ply or multi-ply equipment. United Powerlifting Association (UPA) established a standard for raw powerlifting in 2008, and USAPL held the first Raw Nationals in the same year. Eventually, IPF recognized raw lifting with the sanction of a \"Classic Unequipped World Cup\" in 2012 and published its own set of standards for raw lifting. By this time, the popularity of raw lifting had surged to the point where raw lifters came to predominate over equipped lifters in local meets.\nThe use of knee sleeves in unequipped powerlifting has brought about much debate as to whether certain neoprene knee sleeves can assist a lifter during the squat. Some lifters purposely wear knee sleeves that are excessively tight and have been known to use plastic bags and have others to assist them get their knee sleeves on. This led to the IPF mandating that lifters put on their knee sleeves unassisted.\nEquipped powerlifting.\nEquipped lifters compete separately from raw lifters. Equipped athletes will wear a squat suit, knee wraps, a bench shirt, and a deadlift suit.\nEquipped squats.\nFor the squats, a squat suit is used for the event. Squat suits are typically made of an elastic-like material, and a single-ply polyester layer. This allows a competitor to spring out of the bottom of a squat (called \"popping out of the hole\" in powerlifting circles) by maintaining rigidity, keeping the athlete upright and encouraging their hips to remain parallel with the floor. This allows lifters to lift more weight than would normally be possible without the suit. There are also multi-ply suits giving the lifter more rigidity, like that of a traditional canvas suit, with the same pop as a single-ply suit or briefs but are exponentially harder to use, and are usually reserved for the top lifters. During the squat, lifters also tend to wear knee wraps. Even though knee wraps will be a sub-classification of raw lifting, it will still be worn by equipped lifters. A raw lifter who would squat in knee wraps will have the weight lifted noted as \"with wraps\" to distinguish from raw lifters using knee sleeves. Knee wraps are made out of similar elastic material as wrist wraps. They are wrapped around the lifters knees tightly. The knee wraps are wrapped in a spiral or diagonal method. The knee wraps build elastic energy during the eccentric part of the squat and once the lifter has hit proper depth the lifter will start the concentric part of the movement releasing this elastic energy and using it to help them move the weight upwards. It gives the lifter more spring, or pop out of the hole of the squat resulting in a heavier and faster squat.\nEquipped bench press.\nFor the bench press, there are single-ply and multi-ply bench shirts that work similarly to a squat suit. It acts as artificial pectoral muscles and shoulder muscles for the lifter. It resists the movement of the bench press by compressing and building elastic energy. When the bar is still and the official gives the command to press the compression and elastic energy of the suit aids in the speed of the lift, and support of the weight that the athlete would not be able to provide without the bench shirt.\nEquipped deadlift.\nFor the deadlift, deadlift suits are used for the event. There are single-ply and multi-ply deadlift suits. The elastic energy is built when the lifter goes down to set up and place their grip on the bar before the deadlift attempt. The deadlift suit aids core and spine stability and can increase the speed off the floor at the beginning of the lift. However, deadlift suits are least likely to carry over additional weight in comparison to equipped squatting and equipped bench pressing.\nClasses and categories.\nWeight classes:\nMost powerlifting federations use the following weight classes:\nMen: \u221252\u00a0kg, \u221256\u00a0kg, \u221260\u00a0kg, \u221267.5\u00a0kg, \u221275\u00a0kg, \u221282.5\u00a0kg, \u221290\u00a0kg, \u2212100\u00a0kg, \u2212110\u00a0kg, \u2212125\u00a0kg, \u2212140\u00a0kg, 140\u00a0kg+\nWomen: \u221244\u00a0kg, \u221248\u00a0kg, \u221252\u00a0kg, \u221256\u00a0kg, \u221260\u00a0kg, \u221267.5\u00a0kg, \u221275\u00a0kg, \u221282.5\u00a0kg, \u221290\u00a0kg, 90\u00a0kg+\nIPF weight classes:\nIn 2010, the IPF introduced the following new weight classes effective January 1, 2011:\nMen: \u221253\u00a0kg (sub-junior/junior), \u221259\u00a0kg, \u221266\u00a0kg, \u221274\u00a0kg, \u221283\u00a0kg, \u221293\u00a0kg, \u2212105\u00a0kg, \u2212120\u00a0kg, 120\u00a0kg+\nWomen: \u221243\u00a0kg (sub-junior/junior), \u221247\u00a0kg, \u221252\u00a0kg, \u221257\u00a0kg, \u221263\u00a0kg, \u221272\u00a0kg, \u221284\u00a0kg, 84\u00a0kg+\nIn 2020, the IPF announced the 72 kg weight class would be replaced with the 69 and 76 kg weight class effective January 1, 2021.\nAge categories\nAge categories are depended on the federation.\nThe IPF uses the following age categories: sub-junior (14\u201318), junior (19\u201323), open (any age), masters 1 (40\u201349), masters 2 (50\u201359), masters 3 (60\u201369), masters 4 (70+).\nAge categories are dependent on the year of the participant's birth. For example, if an athlete turns 18 years old in July, the athlete is considered an 18-year-old sub-junior throughout the calendar year. Other federations typically break the Masters categories down to 5-year increments, for example, 40\u201344, 45\u201349, 50\u201354, etc. Some federations also include a sub-master class from 33 (or 35) to 39, however some of these federations only use this category for record keeping purposes and do not use it as a competitive category in meets.\nCompetition.\nA powerlifting competition takes place as follows:\nEach competitor is allowed three attempts on each of the squat, bench press, and deadlift, depending on their standing and the organization they are lifting in. The lifter's best valid attempt on each lift counts toward the competition total. For each weightclass, the lifter with the highest total wins. In many meets, the lifter with the highest total relative to their weight class also wins. If two or more lifters achieve the same total, the lighter lifter ranks above the heavier lifter.\nCompetitors are judged against other lifters of the same sex, weight class, and age. Comparisons of lifters and scores across different weight classes can also be made using handicapping systems. World federations use the following ones: IPF GL Points, Glossbrenner, Reshel, Outstanding Lifter, Schwartz/Malone, Siff; for the junior age categories, Foster coefficient is mostly used; for the masters age categories, McCulloch or Reshel coefficients are mostly used. Winner of a competition based on an official coefficient used by presiding world federation is called \"best lifter\".\nEvents.\nIn a powerlifting competition, sometimes referred to as standard competition, there are three events: bench press, squat and deadlift. Placing is achieved via combined total. Some variations of this are found at some meets such as \"push-pull only\" meets where lifters only compete in the bench press and deadlift, with the bench press coming first and the deadlift after. Single lift meets are often held for the bench press and the deadlift.\nAt a meet, the events will follow in order: squat, then bench press, and the deadlift will be the final lift of the meet.\nRules.\nSquat.\nThere are two types depending on equipment used: conventional stand and monolift stand.\nThe squat starts with the lifter standing erect and the bar loaded with weights resting on the lifter's shoulders or traps. A high bar and low bar position can be used. At the referee's command, the squat begins. The lifter creates a break in the hips, bends their knees and drops into a squatting position. The lifter then ascends back to an erect position. At the referee's command, the bar is returned to the rack and the lift is completed.\nAfter removing the bar from the racks while facing the front of the platform, the lifter may move forward or backward to establish the lifting position. The bar shall be held horizontally across the shoulders with the hands and/or fingers gripping the bar, and the feet flat upon the platform with the knees locked. The lifter shall wait in this position for the head referee's signal to rack the weights.\nThe lifter will be allowed only one commencement signal per attempt. The lifter may be given an additional attempt at the same weight at the head referee's discretion if failure in an attempt was due to any error by one or more of the spotters or by misload.\nBench press.\nWith the lifter resting on the bench, the lifter takes the loaded bar at arm's length. At the discretion of the referee's signal, the lifter lowers the bar to the chest. When the bar becomes motionless on the chest, the referee gives a press command. Then the referee will call 'rack' and the lift is completed as the weight is returned to the rack.\nThe bench equipment will be placed on the platform with the head facing the front or angled up to 45 degrees. The head referee will be positioned on the head side of the bench press discipline.\nTo achieve firm footing, a lifter of any height may use discs or blocks to build up the surface of the platform. Whichever method is chosen, the shoes must be in a solid contact with the surface.\nA lift off may be used by the discretion of the lifter to arm's length. A designated spotter, having provided a centre lift off, must immediately clear the area in front of the head referee. If the personal spotter does not immediately leave the platform area and/or is in any way which impedes the head referees' responsibilities, the referees may determine that the lift is unacceptable, and be declared \"no lift\" by the referees and given three red lights.\nDeadlift.\nIn the deadlift, the lifter may choose a conventional stance or sumo stance. The lifter grasps the loaded bar which is resting on the platform floor. The lifter pulls the weights off the floor and assumes an erect position. The knees must be locked and the shoulders must be back, with the weight held by the lifter's hands. At the referee's command, the bar will be returned to the floor under the control of the lifter.\nThe bar must be laid horizontally in front of the lifter's feet, gripped with an optional grip in both hands, and lifted until the lifter is standing erect. Any raising of the bar or any deliberate attempt to do so will count as an attempt.\nTraining.\nWeight training.\nPowerlifters practice weight training to improve performance in the three competitive lifts\u2014the squat, bench press and deadlift. Weight training routines used in powerlifting are extremely varied. For example, some methods call for the use of many variations on the contest lifts, while others call for a more limited selection of exercises and an emphasis on mastering the contest lifts through repetition. While many powerlifting routines invoke principles of sports science, such as specific adaptation to imposed demand (SAID principle), there is some controversy around the scientific foundations of particular training methods, as exemplified by the debate over the merits of \"speed work\" using velocity based training or training to attain maximum acceleration of submaximal weights. Powerlifting training differs from bodybuilding and weightlifting, with less focus on volume and hypertrophy than bodybuilding and less focus on power generation than weightlifting.\nCommon set &amp; rep schemes are based on a percentage of the lifter's 1RM (one rep maximum\u2014meaning the most weight they are capable of lifting one time). For example, 5 sets of 5 reps (5x5) at 75% of the 1RM. Rest periods between sets range from 2\u20135 minutes based on the lifter's ability to recover fully for the next set.\nRecent advances in the accessibility of reliable and affordable technology has seen a rise in the popularity of velocity based training as a method to autoregulate daily training loads based on bar speed as a marker of readiness and neural fatigue status. Research has shown this to be effective when used both generally or on an individualized basis, and in some studies a superior programming methodology to percentage systems.\nAccessory movements are used to complement the competition lifts. Common accessory movements in powerlifting include bent over row, lunges, good mornings, pull ups and dips.\nVariable resistance training.\nVariable resistance training relies upon adjusting resistance for stronger and weaker parts of a lift. Any given movement has a strength phase sequence which involves moving through phases where a person is relatively stronger or weaker. This is commonly called a \u2018strength curve\u2019 which refers to the graphical representation of these phases. These phases are based upon related anatomical factors such as joint angles, limb length, muscle engagement patterns, muscle strength ratios, etc. Variable resistance training typically involves increasing resistance (usually weight) in the stronger phase and reducing it in the weaker phase. The additional resistance can be added through the use of chains attached to the barbell for a squat in the bottom portion of the squat reduce the overall weight. At the top portion of the squat, the chains are lifted from the floor to increase overall weight. Bands can be used to increase resistance in a similar manner. Alternatively, partial reps with heavier weights can be used in conjunction with full reps with lighter weights. Training both phases accordingly through variable resistance techniques can allow the muscles to strengthen in accordance with a person\u2019s natural strength curve. It avoids a situation where, as a result of training, the weaker phase force potential is disproportionately great in regard to the stronger phase force potential. These benefits can help a lifter to become more explosive and to complete a lift.\nAerobic exercise.\nIn addition to weight training, powerlifters may pursue other forms of training to improve their performance. Aerobic exercises may be used to improve endurance during drawn-out competitions and support recovery from weight training sessions. This would be more noted as GPP training.\nNutrition.\nAlthough powerlifting nutrition is subjective as there can be differences from person to person, there are general guidelines that athletes typically follow in order to perform optimally that can be applied to a strength sport setting. The primary concern of most diets is caloric intake as sufficient calories are needed to offset the energy expenditure of training allowing for adequate recovery from exercise. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends 40-70 kcals/kg/day for strength athletes who engage in 2-3 hours of intense training 5-6 days per week, compared to the 25\u201335 kcals/kg/day recommended for the average person engaging in a general fitness program, as regular training causes additional energy expenditure. Additionally, when powerlifters are in the off season, it is recommended that athletes increase their caloric intake in order to meet the recommendations of the ISSN and optimize their training. In addition to caloric intake, macronutrient intake plays a major role in the success of an athlete's diet. Protein, carbohydrates, and fats all play different roles in the performance and recovery process. Optimizing protein intake enables a powerlifter to build more muscle and recover properly from intense training sessions. The Journal of Sports Sciences recommends that strength athletes consume 1.6g\u20131.7g protein/kg/day in servings of 20 grams, 5 to 6 times a day for maximal muscle growth. Sufficient carbohydrate intake allows an athlete to have adequate energy during training and restore any glycogen that is lost throughout their respect exercise. However, it may not be as crucial for powerlifters as it for endurance athletes like runners due to the nature of the sport. For strength athletes, it is recommended to ingest a range of 4g to 7g carbohydrate/kg/day depending on the stage of training. Timing carbohydrate intake around training sessions may benefit powerlifters by giving them more energy throughout their workout. Moreover, fats may help a strength athlete who is struggling to stay energized by providing more energy density, however, there is unclear evidence on the necessity of fats in a powerlifter's diet. In addition to nutrition from foods, it is very common for powerlifters to take supplements in their diets. Caffeine and creatine mono-hydrate are two of the most research and common supplements among strength athletes as are proven to have benefits for training and recovery.\nFederations.\nProminent international federations include:\nOf these federations, the oldest and most prominent is the IPF, which comprises federations from over 100 countries located on six continents.\nThe IPF is the federation responsible for coordinating participation in the World Games, an international event affiliated with the International Olympic Committee. The IPF has many international affiliates.\nDifferent federations have different rules and different interpretations of these rules, leading to a myriad of variations. Differences arise on the equipment eligible, clothing, drug testing and aspects of allowable technique.\nFurther, the IPF has suspended entire member nations' federations, including the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Iran, India and Uzbekistan, for repeated violations of the IPF's anti-doping policies.\nIn January 2019, USA Powerlifting (at the time, an affiliate of the IPF) updated their policy to exclude transgender participation, in accordance with IOC guidelines.\nOn March 1, 2022, the IPF announced that Russia and Belarus has been temporarily banned from competition due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, supporting Russia's invasion.\nRank and classification.\nThere are several classifications in powerlifting determining rank. These typically include Elite, Master, Class I, II, III, IV. The Elite standard is considered to be within the top 1% of competing powerlifters. Several standards exist, including the United States Powerlifting Association classifications, the IPF/Powerlifting America, USAPL (single-ply) classifications, the APF (multi-ply) classifications, and the Anti-Drug Athletes United (ADAU, raw) classifications.\nThe \"Master\" classification should not be confused with the Master age division, which refers to athletes who are at least 40 years old.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "64231", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64231", "title": "Black September Organization", "text": "Palestinian militant organization (1970 \u2013 c. 1988)\nThe Black September Organization (BSO; ) was a Palestinian militant organization, which was founded in September 1970. Besides other actions, the group was responsible for the assassination of the Jordanian Prime Minister Wasfi Tal, and the Munich massacre, in which eleven Israeli athletes and officials were kidnapped and killed, as well as a West German policeman dying, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, their most publicized event. These attacks led to the creation or specialization of permanent counter-terrorism forces in many European countries.\nOrigin.\nThe group's name is derived from the Black September conflict which began on 16 September 1970, when King Hussein of Jordan declared military rule in response to \"fedayeen\" attempting to seize his kingdom \u2013 resulting in the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Palestinian fighters from Jordan. The BSO began as a small cell of Fatah men determined to take revenge upon King Hussein and the Jordanian Armed Forces. Recruits from the PFLP, as-Sa'iqa, and other groups also joined.\nInitially, most of its members were dissidents within Fatah who had been close to Abu Ali Iyad, the commander of Fatah forces in northern Jordan who continued to fight the Jordanian Army after the PLO leadership withdrew. He was killed, allegedly through execution, by Jordanian forces on 23 July 1971. It was alleged by them that the Jordanian Prime Minister at the time, Wasfi Tal, was personally responsible for his torture and death.\nStructure of the group.\nThere is disagreement among historians, journalists, and primary sources about the nature of the BSO and the extent to which it was controlled by Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) faction controlled at the time by Yasser Arafat.\nIn his book \"Stateless\", Salah Khalaf (Abu Iyad), Arafat's chief of security and a founding member of Fatah, wrote that: \"Black September was not a terrorist organization, but was rather an auxiliary unit of the resistance movement, at a time when the latter was unable to fully realize its military and political potential. The members of the organization always denied any ties between their organization and Fatah or the PLO.\"\nThe denial described in Abu Iyad's claim was mutual: according to a 1972 article in the Jordanian newspaper \"Ad-Dustour\", Mohammed Daoud Oudeh, also known as Abu Daoud, a BSO operative and former senior PLO member, told Jordanian police: \"There is no such organization as Black September. Fatah announces its own operations under this name so that Fatah will not appear as the direct executor of the operation.\" A March 1973 document released in 1981 by the U.S. State Department seemed to confirm that Fatah was Black September's parent organization.\nAccording to American journalist John K. Cooley, the BSO represented a \"total break with the old operational and organizational methods of the \"fedayeen\". Its members operated in air-tight cells of four or more men and women. Each cell's members were kept purposely ignorant of other cells. Leadership was exercised from outside by intermediaries and 'cut-offs' [\"sic\"]\", though there was no centralized leadership.\nCooley writes that many of the cells in Europe and around the world were made up of Palestinians and other Arabs who had lived in their countries of residence as students, teachers, businessmen, and diplomats for many years. Operating without a central leadership, it was a \"true collegial direction\". The cell structure and the need-to-know operational philosophy protected the operatives by ensuring that the apprehension or surveillance of one cell would not affect the others. The structure offered plausible deniability to the Fatah leadership, which was careful to distance itself from Black September operations.\nFatah needed Black September, according to historian Benny Morris. He writes that there was a \"problem of internal PLO or Fatah cohesion, with extremists constantly demanding greater militancy. The moderates apparently acquiesced in the creation of Black September in order to survive\". As a result of pressure from militants, writes Morris, a Fatah congress in Damascus in August\u2013September 1971 agreed to establish Black September. The new organization was based on Fatah's existing special intelligence and security apparatus, and on the PLO offices and representatives in various European capitals, and from very early on, there was cooperation between Black September and the PFLP.\nThe PLO closed Black September down in September 1973, on the anniversary it was created by the \"political calculation that no more good would come of terrorism abroad\" according to Morris. In 1974 Arafat ordered the PLO to withdraw from acts of violence outside the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel.\nMunich massacre.\nThe group was responsible for the 1972 Munich massacre in which eleven Israeli Olympic athletes were murdered, nine of whom were first taken hostage, and the killing of a German police officer, during the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany.\nFollowing the attack, the Israeli government, headed by Prime Minister Golda Meir, launched an assassination campaign and ordered Mossad to assassinate those known to have been involved in the Munich massacre. By 1979, at least one Mossad unit had assassinated eight Black September and PLO members, including Ali Hassan Salameh, nicknamed the \"Red Prince\", the wealthy, flamboyant son of an upper-class family, and commander of Force 17, Yasser Arafat's personal security squad. Salameh was also behind the 1972 hijacking of Sabena Flight 572 from Vienna to Lod. He was killed by a car bomb in Beirut on 22 January 1979. During a raid in Lebanon in April 1973, Israeli commandos killed three senior members of Black September in Beirut. In July 1973, in what became known as the Lillehammer affair, Ahmed Bouchiki, an innocent Moroccan waiter who was mistaken for Ali Hassan Salameh was killed in Norway. Six Israeli operatives were arrested for the murder.\nRemarks in 2010 by Abu Daoud, the alleged mastermind of the Munich kidnappings, deny that any of the Palestinians assassinated by Mossad had any relation to the Munich operation, despite the fact that the list includes two of the three surviving members of the kidnap squad arrested at the airport.\nOther attacks.\nOther actions attributed to Black September include:\nIn fiction.\nThe 1977 film \"Black Sunday\" centers on a fictional Black September plot to attack the Super Bowl. The 2005 film \"Munich\" depicts the Munich massacre and subsequent Israeli campaign of retaliation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "64234", "revid": "3736169", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=64234", "title": "Concupiscence", "text": "Human inclination to sin\nConcupiscence (from Late Latin , from the Latin verb , from , \"with\", here an intensifier, + , \"to desire\" + , a verb-forming suffix denoting beginning of a process or state) is an ardent longing, typically one that is sensual. In Christianity, particularly in Catholic and Lutheran theology, concupiscence is the tendency of humans to sin.\nThere are nine occurrences of in the Douay-Rheims Bible and three occurrences in the \"King James Bible\". It is also one of the English translations of the Koine Greek (\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03af\u03b1), which occurs 39 times in the New Testament.\nInvoluntary sexual arousal is explored in the \"Confessions\" of Augustine, wherein he used the term \"concupiscence\" to refer to sinful lust.\nJewish perspective.\nIn Judaism, there is an early concept of \"yetzer hara\" (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05e6\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e8\u05e2 for \"evil inclination\"). This concept is the inclination of humanity at creation to do evil or violate the will of God. The \"yetzer hara\" is not the product of original sin as in Christian theology, but the tendency of humanity to misuse the natural survival needs of the physical body. Therefore, the natural need of the body for food becomes gluttony, the command to procreate becomes lust, the demands of the body for rest become sloth, and so on.\nIn Judaism, the \"yetzer hara\" is a natural part of God's creation, and God provides guidelines and commands to help followers master this tendency. This doctrine was clarified in the Sifre around 200\u2013350 CE. In Jewish doctrine, it is possible for humanity to overcome the \"yetzer hara\". Therefore, for the Jewish mindset, it is possible for humanity to choose good over evil and it is the person's duty to choose good (cf. Sifrei on Deuteronomy, P. Ekev 45, Kidd. 30b).\nAugustine.\nInvoluntary sexual arousal is explored in the \"Confessions\" of Augustine, wherein he used the term \"concupiscence\" to refer to sinful lust. He taught that Adam's sin is transmitted by concupiscence, or \"hurtful desire\", resulting in humanity becoming a (mass of perdition, condemned crowd), with much enfeebled, though not destroyed, freedom of will. When Adam sinned, human nature was thenceforth transformed. Adam and Eve, via sexual reproduction, recreated human nature. Their descendants now live in sin, in the form of concupiscence, a term Augustine used in a metaphysical, not a psychological sense. Augustine insisted that concupiscence was not \"a being\" but a \"bad quality\", the privation of good or a wound. He admitted that sexual concupiscence () might have been present in the perfect human nature in paradise and that only later it became disobedient to human will as a result of the first couple's disobedience to God's will in the original sin. In Augustine's view (termed \"Realism\"), all of humanity was really present in Adam when he sinned and therefore all have sinned. Original sin, according to Augustine, consists of the guilt of Adam which all humans inherit.\nPelagius.\nThe main opposition came from a monk named Pelagius (354\u2013420 or 440). His views became known as Pelagianism. Although the writings of Pelagius are no longer extant, the eight canons of the Council of Carthage (418) provided corrections to the perceived errors of the early Pelagians. From these corrections, there is a strong similarity between Pelagians and their Jewish counterparts on the concepts of concupiscence. Pelagianism gives mankind the ability to choose between good and evil within their created nature. While rejecting concupiscence, and embracing a concept similar to the \"yetzer hara\", these views rejected humanity's universal need for grace.\nCatholic teaching.\nThe Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) teaches that Adam and Eve were constituted in an original \"state of holiness and justice\" (CCC 375, 376 398), free from concupiscence (CCC 377). The preternatural state enjoyed by Adam and Eve afforded endowments with many prerogatives which, while pertaining to the natural order, were not due to human nature as such. Principal among these were a high degree of infused knowledge, bodily immortality and freedom from pain, and immunity from evil impulses or inclinations. In other words, the lower or animal nature in man was perfectly subject to the control of reason and the will subject to God. Besides this, the Catholic Church teaches that our first parents were also endowed with sanctifying grace by which they were elevated to the supernatural order. By sinning, however, Adam lost this original \"state\", not only for himself but for all human beings (CCC 416).\nAccording to Catholic theology, man has not lost his natural faculties: by the sin of Adam he has been deprived only of the divine gifts to which his nature had no strict right: the complete mastery of his passions, exemption from death, sanctifying grace, and the vision of God in the next life. God the Father, whose gifts were not due to the human race, had the right to bestow them on such conditions as He wished and to make their conservation depend on the fidelity of the head of the family. A prince can confer a hereditary dignity on condition that the recipient remains loyal and that, in case of his rebelling, this dignity shall be taken from him and in consequence from his descendants. It is not, however, intelligible that the prince, on account of a fault committed by a father, should order the hands and feet of all the descendants of the guilty man to be cut off immediately after their birth.\nAs a result of original sin, according to Catholics, human nature has not been totally corrupted (as opposed to the teachings of Luther and Calvin); rather, human nature has only been weakened and wounded, subject to ignorance, suffering, the domination of death, and the inclination to sin and evil (CCC 405, 418). This inclination toward sin and evil is called \"concupiscence\" (CCC 405, 418). Baptism, the Catechism teaches, erases original sin and turns a man back towards God. The inclination toward sin and evil persists, however, and he must continue to struggle against concupiscence (CCC 2520).\nToday, the Catholic Church's teaching on original sin focuses more on its results than on its origins. As Cardinal Ratzinger had intimated in 1981, and as Pope Benedict XVI clarified in 2008: \"How did it happen? This remains obscure... Evil remains mysterious. It is presented as such in great images, as it is in chapter 3 of Genesis, with that scene of the two trees, of the serpent, of sinful man: a great image that makes us guess but cannot explain what is itself illogical.\"\nMethodist teaching.\nThe Wesleyan\u2013Arminian theology of the Methodist Churches, inclusive of the Wesleyan-Holiness movement, teaches that humans, though being born with original sin, can turn to God as a result of \"prevenient grace\" and do good; this prevenient grace convicts humans of the necessity of the new birth (first work of grace), through which he is justified (pardoned) and regenerated. After this, to willfully sin would be to fall from grace, though a person can be restored to fellowship with God through repentance. When the believer is entirely sanctified (second work of grace), his/her original sin is washed away. Methodist theology firstly distinguishes between original sin and actual sin:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt further categorizes sin as being \"sin proper\" and \"sin improper\". Sins proper (or sin, properly so called) are those that are committed freely and willfully, which result in a loss of entire sanctification. Sins improper (or sin, improperly so called) are those in the \"category of benign neglect, fruits of infirmity (forgetfulness, lack of knowledge, etc)\". In traditional Methodist theology, these (improper) sins are not classified as sins, as explained by Wesley, \"Such transgressions you may call sins, if you please: I do not, for the reasons above-mentioned.\" John Wesley explains the matter like this: \"Nothing is sin, strictly speaking, but a voluntary transgression of a known law of God. Therefore, every voluntary breach of the law of love is sin; and nothing else, if we speak properly. To strain the matter farther is only to make way for Calvinism. There may be ten thousand wandering thoughts, and forgetful intervals, without any breach of love, though not without transgressing the Adamic law. But Calvinists would fain confound these together. Let love fill your heart, and it is enough!\"\nAlthough an entirely sanctified person is not free from temptation, \"the entirely sanctified person does have the distinct advantage of a pure heart and the fullness of the Holy Spirit's presence to give strength in resisting temptation.\" If a person backslides through sin proper but later returns to God, he or she must repent and be entirely sanctified again, according to Wesleyan-Arminian theology.\nComparison of the Catholic view with Lutheran, Reformed and Anglican views.\nThe primary difference between Catholic theology and Lutheran, Reformed and Anglican theologies on the issue of concupiscence is whether it can be classified as sin by its own nature. The Catholic Church teaches that while it is highly likely to cause sin, concupiscence is not sin itself. Rather, it is \"the tinder for sin\" which \"cannot harm those who do not consent\" (CCC 1264).\nThis difference is intimately tied with the different traditions on original sin. Lutheran, Reformed, and Anglican theology holds that the original nature of humanity was an innate tendency to good; the special relationship Adam and Eve enjoyed with God was due not to some supernatural gift, but to their own natures. Hence, in these traditions, the Fall was not the destruction of a supernatural gift, leaving humanity's nature to work unimpeded, but rather the corruption of that nature itself. Since the present nature of humans is corrupted from their original nature, it follows that it is not good, but rather evil (although some good may still remain). Thus, in these traditions, concupiscence is evil in itself. The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England state that \"the Apostle doth confess, that concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin\".\nBy contrast, Catholicism, while also maintaining that humanity's original nature is good (CCC 374), teaches that even after this gift was lost after the Fall, human nature still cannot be called evil, because it remains a natural creation of God. Despite the fact that humans sin, Catholic theology teaches that human nature itself is not the \"cause\" of sin, although once it comes into contact with sin it may produce more sin.\nThe difference in views also extends to the relationship between concupiscence and original sin.\nAnother reason for the differing views of Catholics with Lutherans, Reformed, and Anglicans on concupiscence is their position on sin in general. The Magisterial Reformers taught that one can be guilty of sin even if it is not voluntary; the Catholic Church and the Methodist Church, by contrast, traditionally hold that one is guilty of sin only when the sin is voluntary. The Scholastics and magisterial reformers have different views on the issue of what is voluntary and what is not: the Catholic Scholastics considered the emotions of love, hate, like and dislike to be acts of will or choice, while the early Protestant reformers did not. By the Catholic position that one's attitudes are acts of will, sinful attitudes are voluntary. By the magisterial reformer view that these attitudes are involuntary, some sins are involuntary as well. \nSome denominations may relate concupiscence to \"humanity's sinful nature\" in order to distinguish it from particular sinful acts.\nAquinian concept of \"sensuality\".\nThomas Aquinas in the 13th century described two divisions of \"sensuality\": the \"concupiscible\" (pursuit/avoidance instincts) and the \"irascible\" (competition/aggression/defense instincts). With the former are associated the emotions of joy and sadness, love and hate, desire and ; with the latter, daring and fear, hope and despair, anger.\nIslam.\nAl-Ghazali in the 11th century discussed concupiscence from an Islamic perspective in his book \"Kimiya-yi sa'\u0101dat\" (\"The Alchemy of Happiness\"), and also mentioned it in \"The Deliverer from Error.\" In this book, amongst other things, he discusses how to reconcile the concupiscent and the irascible souls, balancing them to achieve happiness. Concupiscence is related to the term \"nafs\" in Arabic.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
