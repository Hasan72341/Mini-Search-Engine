The second Bourbon Restoration lasted until the July Revolution of 1830, during the reigns of Louis XVIII (1814\u20131815, 1815\u20131824) and Charles X (1824\u20131830), brothers of the late King Louis XVI. Exiled supporters of the monarchy returned to France, which had been profoundly changed by the French Revolution. Exhausted by the Napoleonic Wars, the kingdom experienced a period of internal and external peace, stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialisation.\nBackground.\nFollowing the collapse of the Directory in the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November 1799), Napoleon Bonaparte became ruler of France as leader of the Consulate. By the Consulate's end with the creation of the First French Empire on 18 May 1804, Napoleon had consolidated his power into an authoritarian personal rule. After Napoleon spent the next ten years expanding his empire by successive military victories, a coalition of European powers defeated him in the War of the Sixth Coalition, ended the First Empire in 1814, and restored the monarchy to the brothers of Louis XVI. The first Bourbon Restoration lasted from 6 April 1814 to 20 March 1815, when Napoleon managed to escape from exile on the island of Elba and seized power once more. Following Napoleon's final defeat at Waterloo, he was exiled to Saint Helena for the rest of his life. On 8 July 1815 the kingdom was restored, existing until 2 August 1830, after the July Revolution.\nAt the Congress of Vienna, the Bourbons were treated politely by the victorious monarchies, but had to give up nearly all the territorial gains made by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France since 1789.\nConstitutional monarchy.\nUnlike the absolutist Ancien R\u00e9gime, the Restoration government was a constitutional monarchy, which limited the King's power. The new King, Louis XVIII, had been sober enough to realize during two decades in exile that France would not tolerate an attempt to resurrect the 18th century. He accepted the vast majority of reforms instituted from 1792 to 1814. Continuity was his basic policy. He did not try to recover land and property taken from the \u00e9migr\u00e9s. He continued in peaceful fashion the main objectives of Napoleon's foreign policy, such as the limitation of Austrian influence. He reversed Napoleon's actions regarding Spain and the Ottoman Empire, restoring the friendships that had prevailed until 1792.\nPolitically, the period was characterised by a conservative reaction, and consequent minor but persistent civil unrest and disturbances. Otherwise, the political establishment was stable until the subsequent reign of Charles X. It also saw the reestablishment of the Catholic Church as a major power in French politics. Throughout the Bourbon Restoration, France experienced a period of stable economic prosperity and the preliminaries of industrialisation.\nPermanent changes in French society.\nThe eras of the French Revolution and Empire brought a series of major changes to France which the Bourbon Restoration did not reverse.\nAdministration: First, France was now highly centralised, with all important decisions made in Paris. The political geography was completely reorganised and made uniform, dividing the country into more than 80 \"d\u00e9partements\" which have endured into the 21st century. Each department had an identical administrative structure, and was tightly controlled by a prefect appointed by the government in Paris. The thicket of overlapping legal jurisdictions of the pre-Revolutionary regime had all been abolished, and there was now one standardised legal code, administered by judges appointed by Paris, and supported by police under national control.\nThe Church: The Revolutionary governments had confiscated all the lands and buildings of the Catholic Church, selling them to innumerable buyers, and it was politically impossible to restore them. The bishop still ruled his diocese (which was aligned with the new department boundaries) and communicated with the Pope through the government. Bishops, priests, nuns, and other religious, once severely persecuted, were paid state salaries.\nAll the old religious rites and ceremonies were retained, and the government maintained France's religious buildings. The Church was allowed to operate its own seminaries and to some extent local schools as well, although this became a central political issue into the 20th century. Bishops were much less powerful than before, and had no political voice. The Catholic Church refocused on a new emphasis on personal piety, influencing the faithful.\nEducation: Public education was centralised, with the Grand Master of the University of France controlling every element of the national educational system from Paris. New technical universities were opened in Paris which to this day have a critical role in training the elite.\nThe aristocracy: Conservatism was bitterly split into the returning ancient aristocracy and the new elite arising under Napoleon after 1796. The new elite, the 'noblesse d'empire', ridiculed the older group as an outdated remnant of a discredited regime that had led the nation to disaster. Both groups shared a fear of social disorder, but the level of distrust as well as the cultural differences were too great for political cooperation to be possible.\nThe returning old aristocracy recovered much of the land they had owned directly. However, they lost all their old seigneurial rights to the rest of the farmland, and the peasants were no longer under their control. The pre-Revolutionary aristocracy had dallied with the ideas of the Enlightenment, but now was much more conservative and supportive of the Catholic Church. For the best jobs, meritocracy was the new policy, and aristocrats had to compete directly with the growing business and professional class.\nCitizens' rights: Public anti-clerical sentiment in Paris became stronger, but was now based in certain elements of the middle class and even the peasantry; the greatest masses of French people, who were peasants in the countryside, supported the Church. Citizens gained new rights and a new sense of possibilities. Although relieved of many of the old burdens, controls, and taxes, the peasantry was still highly traditional in its social and economic behaviour. Many eagerly took on mortgages to buy as much land as possible for their children, so debt was an important factor in their calculations. The working class in the cities was a small element, freed of many restrictions imposed by mediaeval guilds. However, France was very slow to industrialise, and much of the work remained drudgery without machinery or technology to help. France was still split into localities, especially in terms of language, but now there was an emerging French nationalism that focused on national pride in the army and foreign affairs.\nPolitical overview.\nIn April 1814, the Armies of the Sixth Coalition restored Louis XVIII to the throne, the brother and heir of the late Louis XVI. A popular constitution was granted by the King: the Charter of 1814. It presented all Frenchmen as equal before the law while retaining substantial prerogatives for the King and nobility and limited voting to those paying at least 300 francs a year in direct taxes.\nThe King was the supreme head of the state. He commanded the land and sea forces, declared war, made treaties of peace, alliance, and commerce, appointed all public officials, and made the necessary regulations and ordinances for the execution of the laws and the security of the state. Louis XVIII was relatively liberal and willing to compromise, choosing many centrist cabinets.\nLouis XVIII died in September 1824 and was succeeded by his brother, who reigned as Charles X. The new King pursued a more conservative form of governance than Louis XVIII. His laws included the Anti-Sacrilege Act (1825\u20131830). Exasperated by Parisian resistance and disrespect, the King and his ministers attempted to curb liberalism by intervening in the general election of 1830 through the July Ordinances. This sparked a revolution in the streets of Paris, Charles X abdicated along with his son the Dauphin in favour of Henri, Duke of Bordeaux, appointing Louis Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans regent. Instead, Louis Philippe hid the King's request and allowed the Chamber of Deputies to proclaim him 'King of the French', ushering in the July Monarchy, which would collapse in 1848.\nLouis XVIII, 1814\u20131824.\nFirst Restoration (1814).\nLouis XVIII's restoration to the throne in 1814 was effected largely through the support of Napoleon's former foreign minister, Talleyrand, who convinced the victorious Allied Powers of the desirability of a Bourbon Restoration. The Allies had initially split on the best candidate for the throne: Britain favoured the Bourbons, the Austrian Habsburgs considered a regency for Napoleon's son (as his Habsburg mother would have been the regent), and the Russians were open to either the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, Louis Philippe, or Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, Napoleon's former Marshal, who was heir-presumptive to the Swedish throne. Napoleon was offered to keep the throne in February 1814, on the condition that France return to its 1792 frontiers, but he refused. The feasibility of the Restoration was in doubt, but the allure of peace to a war-weary French public, and demonstrations of support for the Bourbons in Paris, Bordeaux, Marseille, and Lyon, helped reassure the Allies.\nLouis, in accordance with the Declaration of Saint-Ouen, granted a written constitution, the Charter of 1814, which guaranteed a bicameral legislature with a hereditary/appointive Chamber of Peers and an elected Chamber of Deputies \u2013 their role was consultative (except on taxation), as only the King had the power to propose or sanction laws, and appoint or recall ministers. The franchise was limited to men with considerable property holdings, and just 1% of people could vote. Many of the legal, administrative, and economic reforms of the Revolutionary period were left intact; the Napoleonic Code, which guaranteed legal equality and civil liberties, the peasants' \"biens nationaux\", and the new system of dividing the country into \"d\u00e9partments\" were not undone by the King. Relations between Church and state remained regulated by the Concordat of 1801. The constitution was not imposed on the King, the preamble declaring it to be a 'concession and grant', given 'by the free exercise of our royal authority'.\nThe Hundred Days.\nNapoleon, on 20 March 1815, returned to Paris from Elba to find the city indifferent or even against his return. On his route, most troops sent to stop his march, including some that were nominally royalist, felt more inclined to join the former Emperor than to stop him. Louis XVIII left Paris for Ghent on 19 March where he established the Ghent government-in-exile.\nAfter Napoleon was defeated in the Battle of Waterloo and sent again into exile, Louis XVIII returned. During his absence a small revolt in the traditionally pro-royalist Vend\u00e9e was put down, but there were otherwise few subversive acts favouring the Restoration, even though Napoleon's popularity was low.\nSecond Restoration (1815).\nTalleyrand was again influential in seeing that the Bourbons were restored to power, as was Joseph Fouch\u00e9, Napoleon's minister of police during the Hundred Days. This Second Restoration saw the beginning of the Second White Terror, largely in the south, where unofficial groups supporting the monarchy sought revenge against those who had aided Napoleon's return: about 200\u2013300 were killed while thousands fled. About 70,000 government officials were dismissed. The pro-Bourbon perpetrators were often known as the \"\" because of their green cockets, which was the colour of the Count of Artois \u2013 this being the title of the future Charles X at the time, who was associated with the hardline ultra-royalists, or Ultras. After a period in which local authorities did not stop the violence, the King and his ministers sent out officials to restore order.\nA new Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815, which had more punitive terms than the 1814 treaty. France was ordered to pay 700 million francs in indemnities and the country's borders were reduced to their 1790 status, rather than 1792 as in the previous treaty. Until 1818, France was occupied by 1.2 million foreign soldiers, including around 200,000 under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and France was made to pay the costs of their accommodation and rations. The promise of tax cuts, prominent in 1814, was impracticable because of these payments. The legacy of this, and the White Terror, left Louis XVIII with a formidable opposition.\nLouis's chief ministers were at first moderate, including Talleyrand, the Duke of Richelieu, and \u00c9lie, Duke of Decazes; Louis XVIII himself followed a cautious policy. The \"chambre introuvable\", elected in 1815, given the nickname 'unobtainable' by Louis, was dominated by an overwhelming ultra-royalist majority which quickly acquired the reputation of being 'more royalist than the King'. The legislature threw out the Talleyrand-Fouch\u00e9 government and sought to legitimize the White Terror, passing judgement against enemies of the state, sacking 50,000\u201380,000 civil servants, and dismissing 15,000 army officers. Richelieu, an \"\u00e9migr\u00e9\" who had left in October 1789, who 'had nothing at all to do with the new France', was appointed Prime Minister. The \"chambre introuvable\", meanwhile, continued to aggressively uphold the place of the monarchy and the Church, and called for more commemorations for historical royal figures. Over the course of the parliamentary term, the ultra-royalists increasingly began to fuse their brand of politics with state ceremony, much to Louis' distress. Decazes, perhaps the most moderate minister, moved to stop the politicisation of the National Guard (many \"Verdets\" had been drafted in) by banning political demonstrations by the militia in July 1816.\nOwing to tension between the King's government and the ultra-royalist Chamber of Deputies, the latter began to assert their rights. After they attempted to obstruct the 1816 budget, the government conceded that the chamber had the right to approve state expenditure. However, they were unable to gain a guarantee from the King that his cabinets would represent the majority in parliament.\nIn September 1816, the chamber was dissolved by Louis XVIII, and electoral manipulation resulted in a more liberal chamber in 1816. Richelieu served until 29 December 1818, followed by Jean-Joseph, Marquis Dessolles until 19 November 1819, and then Decazes (in reality the dominant minister from 1818 to 1820) until 20 February 1820. This was the era in which the \"Doctrinaires\" dominated policy, hoping to reconcile the monarchy with the French Revolution. The following year, the government changed the electoral laws, resorting to gerrymandering, and altering the franchise to allow some rich men of trade and industry to vote, in an attempt to prevent the ultras from winning a majority in future elections. Press censorship was clarified and relaxed, some positions in the military hierarchy were made open to competition, and mutual schools were set up that encroached on the Catholic monopoly of public primary education. Decazes purged a number of ultra-royalist prefects and sub-prefects, and in by-elections, an unusually high proportion of Bonapartists and republicans were elected, some of whom were backed by ultras resorting to tactical voting. The ultras were strongly critical of the practice of giving civil service employment or promotions to deputies, as the government continued to consolidate its position.\nBy 1820, the opposition liberals\u2014who, with the ultras, made up half the chamber\u2014proved unmanageable, and Decazes and the king were looking for ways to revise the electoral laws again, to ensure a more tractable conservative majority. In February 1820, the assassination by a Bonapartist of the Duc de Berry, the ultrareactionary son of Louis' ultrareactionary brother and heir-presumptive, the future Charles X, triggered Decazes' fall from power and the triumph of the Ultras.\nRichelieu returned to power for a short interval, from 1820 to 1821. The press was more strongly censored, detention without trial was reintroduced, and \"Doctrinaire\" leaders, such as Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, were banned from teaching at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure. Under Richelieu, the franchise was changed to give the wealthiest electors a double vote, in time for the November 1820 election. After a resounding victory, a new Ultra ministry was formed, headed by Jean-Baptiste de Vill\u00e8le, a leading Ultra who served for six years. The ultras found themselves back in power in favourable circumstances: Berry's wife, the duchesse de Berry, gave birth to a \"miracle child\", Henri, seven months after the duc's death; Napoleon died on Saint Helena in 1821, and his son, the duc de Reichstadt, remained interned in Austrian hands. Literary figures, most notably Chateaubriand, but also Hugo, Lamartine, Vigny, and Nodier, rallied to the ultras' cause. Both Hugo and Lamartine later became republicans, whilst Nodier was formerly. Soon, however, Vill\u00e8le proved himself to be nearly as cautious as his master, and, so long as Louis lived, overtly reactionary policies were kept to a minimum.\nThe ultras broadened their support, and put a stop to growing military dissent in 1823, when intervention in Spain, in favour of Spanish Bourbon King Ferdinand VII, and against the Liberal Spanish Government, fomented popular patriotic fervour. Despite British backing for the military action, the intervention was widely seen as an attempt to win back influence in Spain, which had been lost to the British under Napoleon. The French expeditionary army, called the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, was led by the duc d'Angoul\u00eame, the comte d'Artois's son. The French troops marched to Madrid and then to C\u00e1diz, ousting the Liberals with little fighting (April to September 1823), and would remain in Spain for five years. Support for the ultras amongst the voting rich was further strengthened by doling out favours in a similar fashion to the 1816 chamber, and fears over the \"charbonnerie\", the French equivalent of the \"carbonari\". In the 1824 election, another large majority was secured.\nLouis XVIII died on 16 September 1824 and was succeeded by his brother, the Comte d'Artois, who took the title of Charles X.\nCharles X.\n1824\u20131830: Conservative turn.\nThe accession to the throne of Charles X, the leader of the ultra-royalist faction, coincided with the ultras' control of power in the Chamber of Deputies; thus, the ministry of the comte de Vill\u00e8le was able to continue. The restraint Louis had exercised on the ultra-royalists was removed.\nAs the country underwent a Christian revival in the post-revolutionary years, the ultras worked to raise the status of the Roman Catholic Church once more. The Church and State Concordat of 11 June 1817 was set to replace the Concordat of 1801, but, despite being signed, it was never validated. The Vill\u00e8le government, under pressure from the \"\" including many deputies, voted in the Anti-Sacrilege Act in January 1825, which punished by death the theft of consecrated hosts. The law was unenforceable and only enacted for symbolic purposes, though the act's passing caused a considerable uproar, particularly among the \"Doctrinaires\". Much more controversial was the introduction of the Jesuits, who set up a network of colleges for elite youth outside the official university system. The Jesuits were noted for their loyalty to the Pope and gave much less support to Gallican traditions. Inside and outside the Church they had enemies, and the king ended their institutional role in 1828.\nNew legislation paid an indemnity to royalists whose lands had been confiscated during the Revolution. Although this law had been engineered by Louis, Charles was influential in seeing that it was passed. A bill to finance this compensation, by converting government debt (the \"rente\") from 5% to 3% bonds, which would save the state 30 million francs a year in interest payments, was also put before the chambers. Vill\u00e8le's government argued that \"rentiers\" had seen their returns grow disproportionately to their original investment, and that the redistribution was just. The final law allocated state funds of 988 million francs for compensation (\"le milliard des \u00e9migr\u00e9s\"), financed by government bonds at a value of 600\u00a0million francs at 3% interest. Around 18\u00a0million francs were paid per year. Unexpected beneficiaries of the law were some one million owners of \"biens nationaux\", the old confiscated lands, whose property rights were now confirmed by the new law, leading to a sharp rise in its value.\nOn 29 May 1825 the Coronation of Charles X took place at Reims Cathedral, the traditional site of French coronations.\nIn 1826, Vill\u00e8le introduced a bill reestablishing the law of primogeniture, at least for owners of large estates, unless they chose otherwise. The liberals and the press rebelled, as did some dissident ultras, such as Chateaubriand. Their vociferous criticism prompted the government to introduce a bill to restrict the press in December, having largely withdrawn censorship in 1824. This only inflamed the opposition even more, and the bill was withdrawn.\nThe Vill\u00e8le cabinet faced increasing pressure in 1827 from the liberal press, including the \"Journal des d\u00e9bats\", which sponsored Chateaubriand's articles. Chateaubriand, the most prominent of the anti-Vill\u00e8le ultras, had combined with other opponents of press censorship (a new law had reimposed it on 24 July 1827) to form the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des amis de la libert\u00e9 de la presse\"; Choiseul-Stainville, Salvandy and Villemain were among the contributors. Another influential society was the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Aide-toi, le ciel t'aidera\", which worked within the confines of legislation banning the unauthorized meetings of more than 20 members. The group, emboldened by the rising tide of opposition, was of a more liberal composition (associated with \"Le Globe\") and included members such as Guizot, R\u00e9musat, and Barrot. Pamphlets were sent out which evaded the censorship laws, and the group provided organizational assistance to liberal candidates against pro-government state officials in the November 1827 election.\nIn April 1827, the King and Vill\u00e8le were confronted by an unruly National Guard. The garrison which Charles reviewed, under orders to express deference to the king but disapproval of his government, instead shouted derogatory anti-Jesuit remarks at his devoutly Catholic niece and daughter in law, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, Madame la Dauphine. Vill\u00e8le suffered worse treatment, as liberal officers led troops to protest at his office. In response, the Guard was disbanded. Pamphlets continued to proliferate, which included accusations in September that Charles, on a trip to Saint-Omer, was colluding with the Pope and planned to reinstate the tithe, and had suspended the Charter under the protection of a loyal garrison army.\nBy the time of the election, the moderate royalists (constitutionalists) were also beginning to turn against Charles, as was the business community, in part due to a financial crisis in 1825, which they blamed on the government's law of indemnification. Hugo and a number of other writers, dissatisfied with the reality of life under Charles X, also began to criticize the regime. In preparation for the 30 September registration cut-off for the election, opposition committees worked furiously to get as many voters as possible signed up, countering the actions of \"pr\u00e9fects\", who began removing certain voters who had failed to provide up-to-date documents since the 1824 election. 18,000 voters were added to the 60,000 on the first list; despite pr\u00e9fect attempts to register those who met the franchise and were supporters of the government, this can mainly be attributed to opposition activity. Organization was mainly divided behind Chateaubriand's Friends and the \"Aide-toi,\" which backed liberals, \"constitutionnels\", and the \"contre-opposition\" (constitutional monarchists).\nThe new chamber did not result in a clear majority for any side. Vill\u00e8le's successor, the vicomte de Martignac, who began his term in January 1828, tried to steer a middle course, appeasing liberals by loosening press controls, expelling Jesuits, modifying electoral registration, and restricting the formation of Catholic schools. Charles, unhappy with the new government, surrounded himself with men from the \"Chevaliers de la Foi\" and other ultras, such as the Prince de Polignac and La Bourdonnaye. Martignac was deposed when his government lost a bill on local government. Charles and his advisers believed a new government could be formed with the support of the Vill\u00e8le, Chateaubriand, and Decazes monarchist factions, but chose a chief minister, Polignac, in November 1829 who was repellent to the liberals and, worse, Chateaubriand. Though Charles remained nonchalant, the deadlock led some royalists to call for a \"coup\", and prominent liberals for a tax strike.\nAt the opening of the session in March 1830, the King delivered a speech that contained veiled threats to the opposition; in response, 221 deputies (an absolute majority) condemned the government, and Charles subsequently prorogued and then dissolved parliament. Charles retained a belief that he was popular amongst the unenfranchised mass of the people, and he and Polignac chose to pursue an ambitious foreign policy of colonialism and expansionism, with the assistance of Russia. France had intervened in the Mediterranean a number of times after Vill\u00e8le's resignation, and expeditions were now sent to Greece and Madagascar. Polignac also initiated the French conquest of Algeria; victory was announced over the Dey of Algiers in early July. Plans were drawn up to invade Belgium, which was shortly to undergo its own revolution. However, foreign policy did not prove sufficient to divert attention from domestic problems.\nCharles's dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, his \"July Ordinances\" which set up rigid control of the press, and his restriction of suffrage resulted in the July Revolution of 1830. The major cause of the regime's downfall, however, was that, while it managed to keep the support of the aristocracy, the Catholic Church and even much of the peasantry, the ultras' cause was deeply unpopular outside of parliament and with those who did not hold the franchise, especially the industrial workers and the bourgeoisie. A major reason was a sharp rise in food prices, caused by a series of bad harvests 1827\u20131830. Workers living on the margin were very hard-pressed, and angry that the government paid little attention to their urgent needs.\nCharles abdicated in favor of his grandson, the Comte de Chambord, and left for England. However, the liberal, bourgeois-controlled Chamber of Deputies refused to confirm the Comte de Chambord as Henry V. In a vote largely boycotted by conservative deputies, the body declared the French throne vacant, and elevated Louis-Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, to power.\n1827\u20131830: Tensions.\nThere is still considerable debate among historians as to the actual cause of the downfall of Charles X. What is generally conceded, though, is that between 1820 and 1830, a series of economic downturns combined with the rise of a liberal opposition within the Chamber of Deputies, ultimately felled the conservative Bourbons.\nBetween 1827 and 1830, France faced an economic downturn, industrial and agricultural, that was possibly worse than the one that sparked the revolution. A series of progressively worsening grain harvests in the late 1820s pushed up the prices on various staple foods and cash crops. In response, the rural peasantry throughout France lobbied for the relaxation of protective tariffs on grain to lower prices and ease their economic situation. However, Charles X, bowing to pressure from wealthier landowners, kept the tariffs in place. He did so based upon the Bourbon response to the \"Year Without a Summer\" in 1816, during which Louis XVIII relaxed tariffs during a series of famines, caused a downturn in prices, and incurred the ire of wealthy landowners, who were the traditional source of Bourbon legitimacy. Thus, between 1827 and 1830, peasants throughout France faced a period of relative economic hardship and rising prices.\nAt the same time, international pressures, combined with weakened purchasing power from the provinces, led to decreased economic activity in urban centers. This industrial downturn contributed to the rising poverty levels among Parisian artisans. Thus, by 1830, multiple demographics had suffered from the economic policies of Charles X.\nWhile the French economy faltered, a series of elections brought a relatively powerful liberal bloc into the Chamber of Deputies. The 17-strong liberal bloc of 1824 grew to 180 in 1827, and 274 in 1830. This liberal majority grew increasingly dissatisfied with the policies of the centrist Martignac and the ultra-royalist Polignac, seeking to protect the limited protections of the Charter of 1814. They sought both the expansion of the franchise, and more liberal economic policies. They also demanded the right, as the majority bloc, to appoint the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.\nAlso, the growth of the liberal bloc within the Chamber of Deputies corresponded roughly with the rise of a liberal press within France. Generally centered around Paris, this press provided a counterpoint to the government's journalistic services, and to the newspapers of the right. It grew increasingly important in conveying political opinions and the political situation to the Parisian public, and can thus be seen as a crucial link between the rise of the liberals and the increasingly agitated and economically suffering French masses.\nBy 1830, the Restoration government of Charles X faced difficulties on all sides. The new liberal majority clearly had no intention of budging in the face of Polignac's aggressive policies. The rise of a liberal press within Paris which outsold the official government newspaper indicated a general shift in Parisian politics towards the left. And yet, Charles' base of power was certainly toward the right of the political spectrum, as were his own views. He simply could not yield to the growing demands from within the Chamber of Deputies. The situation would soon come to a head.\n1830: The July Revolution.\nThe Charter of 1814 had made France a constitutional monarchy. While the king retained extensive power over policy-making, as well as the sole power of the Executive, he was, nonetheless, reliant upon the Parliament to accept and pass his legal decrees. The Charter also fixed the method of election of the Deputies, their rights within the Chamber of Deputies, and the rights of the majority bloc. Thus, in 1830, Charles X faced a significant problem. He could not overstep his constitutional bounds, and yet, he could not pursue his policies with a liberal majority within the Chamber of Deputies. He was ready for stark action and made his move after a final no-confidence vote by the liberal house majority, in March 1830. He set about to alter the Charter of 1814 by decree. These decrees, known as the \"Four Ordinances\", dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, suspended the liberty of the press, excluded the more liberal commercial middle-class from future elections, and called for new elections.\nOpinion was outraged. On 10 July 1830, before the king had even made his declarations, a group of wealthy, liberal journalists and newspaper proprietors, led by Adolphe Thiers, met in Paris to decide upon a strategy to counter Charles X. It was decided then, nearly three weeks before the Revolution, that in the event of Charles' expected proclamations, the journalistic establishment of Paris would publish vitriolic criticisms of the king's policies in an attempt to mobilise the masses. Thus, when Charles X made his declarations on 25 July 1830, the liberal journalism machine mobilised, publishing articles and complaints decrying the despotism of the king's actions.\nThe urban mobs of Paris also mobilised, driven by patriotic fervour and economic hardship, assembling barricades and attacking the infrastructure of Charles X. Within days, the situation escalated beyond the ability of the monarchy to control it. As the Crown moved to shut down liberal periodicals, the radical Parisian masses defended those publications. They also launched attacks against pro-Bourbon presses, and paralysed the coercive apparatus of the monarchy. Seizing the opportunity, the liberals in Parliament began drafting resolutions, complaints, and censures against the king. The king finally abdicated on 30 July 1830. Twenty minutes later, his son, Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame, who had nominally succeeded as Louis XIX, also abdicated. The Crown nominally then fell upon the son of Louis Antoine's younger brother, who was in line to become Henry V. However, the newly empowered Chamber of Deputies declared the throne vacant, and on 9 August, elevated Louis-Philippe, to the throne. Thus, the July Monarchy began.\nLouis-Philippe and the House of Orl\u00e9ans.\nLouis Philippe I ascended the throne on the strength of the July Revolution of 1830, and ruled, not as \"King of France\" but as \"King of the French\", marking the shift to national sovereignty. The Orl\u00e9anists remained in power until 1848. Following the ousting of the last king to rule France during the February 1848 Revolution, the French Second Republic was formed with the election of Louis-Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte as President (1848\u20131852). In the French coup of 1851, Napoleon declared himself Emperor Napoleon III of the Second Empire, which lasted from 1852 to 1870.\nPolitical parties under Restoration.\nPolitical parties saw substantial changes of alignment and membership under the Restoration. The Chamber of Deputies oscillated between repressive \"ultra-royalist\" phases and progressive \"liberal\" phases. The repression of the \"White Terror\" excluded opponents of the monarchy from the political scene, but individuals of influence who had different visions of the French constitutional monarchy still clashed.\nAll parties remained fearful of the common people, who had no voting rights and whom Adolphe Thiers later referred to by the term \"cheap multitude\". Their political sights were set on a class favoritism. Political changes in the Chamber were due to abuse by the majority tendency, involving a dissolution and then an inversion of the majority, or critical events; for example, the assassination of the Duc de Berry in 1820.\nDisputes were a power struggle between the powerful (royalty against deputies) rather than a fight between royalty and populism. Although the deputies claimed to defend the interests of the people, most had an important fear of common people, of innovations, of socialism and even of simple measures, such as the extension of voting rights.\nThe principal political parties during the Restoration are described below.\nUltra-royalists.\nThe Ultra-royalists wished for a return to the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" which prevailed before 1789: absolute monarchy, domination by the nobility, and the monopoly of politics by \"devoted Christians\". They were anti-Republican, anti-democratic, and preached \"Government on High\". Although they tolerated \"vote censitaire,\" a form of democracy limited to those paying taxes above a high threshold, they found the Charter of 1814 to be too revolutionary. They wanted a re-establishment of privileges, a major political role for the Catholic Church, and a politically active, rather than ceremonial, king: Charles X.\nProminent ultra-royalist theorists were Louis de Bonald and Joseph de Maistre. Their parliamentary leaders were , comte de La Bret\u00e8che and, in 1829, Jules de Polignac. The main royalist newspapers were \"La Quotidienne\" and \"La Gazette,\" supplemented by the \"Drapeau Blanc\", named after the Bourbon white flag, and the \"Oriflamme\", named after the battle standard of France.\nDoctrinaires.\nThe \"Doctrinaires\" were mostly rich and educated middle-class men: lawyers, senior officials of the Empire, and academics. They feared the triumph of the aristocracy, as much as that of the democrats. They accepted the Royal Charter as a guarantee of freedom and civil equality which nevertheless reined in the ignorant and excitable masses. Ideologically they were classical liberals who formed the centre-right of the Restoration's political spectrum: they upheld both capitalism and Catholicism, and attempted to reconcile parliamentarism (in an elite, wealth-based form) and monarchism (in a constitutional, ceremonial form), while rejecting both the absolutism and clericalism of the Ultra-Royalists, and the universal suffrage of the liberal left and republicans. Important personalities were Pierre Paul Royer-Collard, Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, and the count of Serre. Their newspapers were \"Le Courrier fran\u00e7ais\" and \"Le Censeur\".\nLiberal Left.\nThe Liberals were mostly petite-bourgeoisie: doctors and lawyers, men of law, and, in rural constituencies, merchants and traders of national goods. Electorally they benefitted from the slow emergence of a new middle-class elite, due to the start of the Industrial Revolution.\nSome of them accepted the principle of monarchy, in a strictly ceremonial and parliamentary form, while others were moderate republicans. Constitutional issues aside, they agreed on seeking to restore the democratic principles of the French Revolution, such as the weakening of clerical and aristocratic power, and therefore thought the constitutional Charter was not sufficiently democratic, and disliked the peace treaties of 1815, the White Terror and the return to pre-eminence of clergy and of nobility. They wished to lower the taxable quota to support the middle-class as a whole, to the detriment of the aristocracy, and thus they supported universal suffrage or at least a wide opening-up of the electoral system to the modest middle-classes such as farmers and craftsmen. Important personalities were parliamentary monarchist Benjamin Constant, officer of the Empire Maximilien Sebastien Foy, republican lawyer Jacques-Antoine Manuel, and the Marquis de Lafayette. Their newspapers were \"La Minerve\", \"Le Constitutionnel\", and \"Le Globe\".\nRepublicans and Socialists.\nThe only active Republicans were on the left to far-left, based among the workers. Workers had no vote and were not listened to. Their demonstrations were repressed or diverted, causing, at most, a reinforcement of parliamentarism, which did not mean democratic evolution, only wider taxation. For some, such as Blanqui, revolution seemed the only solution. Garnier-Pag\u00e8s, and Louis-Eug\u00e8ne and \u00c9l\u00e9onore-Louis Godefroi Cavaignac considered themselves to be Republicans, while Cabet and Raspail were active as socialists. Saint-Simon was also active during this period, and made direct appeals to Louis XVIII before his death in 1824.\n\u00c9variste Galois and the Role of Students.\n\u00c9variste Galois was a French mathematician born in 1811 and came of age during the final phase of the Bourbon Restoration. He was educated at the Coll\u00e8ge Louis-le-Grand and the \u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire, and much of his student career existed during a time when political surveillance of students, tensions between the monarchy and liberal youths, and restrictions on republicanism were prevalent.\nIn the late 1820s, Parisian students became increasingly involved in political activism, and Galois engaged with several liberal and republican circles. His conflicts with the administration of the \u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire stemmed from suspicions about his political opinions, and student activism at the time had risen in priority among restoration officials. Along with this, Galois experienced repeated rejections of his mathematical papers by the Acad\u00e9mie, contributing to his sense of isolation and frustration.\nIn May 1832, shortly after the July Revolution, Galois wrote a letter to his friend Auguste Chevalier. In it, he described his anger toward academic institutions, referring to political repression, censorship, and what he saw as a lack of support from scientific authorities. Although written two years after the fall of the Bourbon regime, the letter reflects tensions that had developed during the 1820s between state-controlled academic institutions and politically active students. As one of the few surviving documents expressing Galois\u2019s personal views\u2014completed only days before his death\u2014the letter provides insight into the challenges faced by young intellectuals navigating political constraints in the final years of the Bourbon Restoration.\nReligion.\nBy 1800 the Catholic Church was poor, dilapidated and disorganized, with a depleted and aging clergy. The younger generation had received little religious instruction, and was unfamiliar with traditional worship. However, in response to the external pressures of foreign wars, religious fervor was strong, especially among women. Napoleon's Concordat of 1801 provided stability and ended attacks on the Church.\nWith the Restoration, the Catholic Church again became the state religion, supported financially and politically by the government. Its lands and financial endowments were not returned, but the government paid salaries and maintenance costs for normal church activities. The bishops regained control of Catholic affairs. The aristocracy before the Revolution was lukewarm to religious doctrine and practice, but the decades of exile created an alliance of throne and altar. The royalists who returned were much more devout, and much more aware of their need for a close alliance with the Church. They had discarded fashionable skepticism and now promoted the wave of Catholic religiosity that was sweeping Europe, with a new reverence for the Virgin Mary, the saints, and popular religious rituals such as praying the rosary. Devotion was far stronger and more visible in rural areas than in Paris and other cities. The population of 32 million included about 680,000 Protestants and 60,000 Jews, who were extended toleration. The anti-clericalism of Voltaire and the Enlightenment had not disappeared, but it was in abeyance.\nAt the elite level, there was a dramatic change in intellectual climate from intellectual classicism to passionate romanticism. An 1802 book by Fran\u00e7ois-Ren\u00e9 de Chateaubriand entitled \"G\u00e9nie du christianisme\" (\"The Genius of Christianity\") had an enormous influence in reshaping French literature and intellectual life, emphasising the centrality of religion in creating European high culture. Chateaubriand's book \"did more than any other single work to restore the credibility and prestige of Christianity in intellectual circles and launched a fashionable rediscovery of the Middle Ages and their Christian civilisation. The revival was by no means confined to an intellectual elite, however, but was evident in the real, if uneven, rechristianisation of the French countryside.\"\nEconomy.\nWith the restoration of the Bourbons in 1814, the reactionary aristocracy with its disdain for entrepreneurship returned to power. British goods flooded the market, and France responded with high tariffs and protectionism to protect its established businesses, especially handcrafts and small-scale manufacturing such as textiles. The tariff on iron goods reached 120%. Agriculture had never needed protection, but now demanded it due to the lower prices of imported foodstuffs, such as Russian grain. French winegrowers strongly supported the tariff \u2013 their wines did not need it, but they insisted on a high tariff on the import of tea. One agrarian deputy explained: \"Tea breaks down our national character by converting those who use it often into cold and stuffy Nordic types, while wine arouses in the soul that gentle gaiety that gives Frenchmen their amiable and witty national character.\" The French government falsified official statistics to claim that exports and imports were growing \u2013 actually there was stagnation, and the economic crisis of 1826\u201329 disillusioned the business community and readied them to support the revolution in 1830.\nArt and literature.\nRomanticism reshaped art and literature. It stimulated the emergence of a wide new middle class audience.\nAmong the most popular works were:\nParis.\nThe city grew slowly in population from 714,000 in 1817 to 786,000 in 1831. During the period Parisians saw the first public transport system, the first gas street lights, and the first uniformed Paris policemen. In July 1830, a popular uprising in the streets of Paris brought down the Bourbon monarchy.\nMemory and historical evaluation.\nAfter two decades of war and revolution, the restoration brought peace and quiet, and general prosperity. Gordon Wright says, \"Frenchmen were, on the whole, well governed, prosperous, contented during the 15-year period; one historian even describes the restoration era as 'one of the happiest periods in [France's] history.\nFrance had recovered from the strain and disorganization, the wars, the killings, the horrors, of two decades of disruption. It was at peace throughout the period. It paid a large war indemnity to the winners, but managed to finance that without distress; the occupation soldiers left peacefully. France's population increased by three million, and prosperity was strong from 1815 to 1825, with the depression of 1825 caused by bad harvests. The national credit was strong, there was significant increase in public wealth, and the national budget showed a surplus every year. In the private sector, banking grew dramatically, making Paris a world center for finance, along with London. The Rothschild family was world-famous, with the French branch led by James Mayer de Rothschild (1792\u20131868). The communication system was improved, as roads were upgraded, canals were lengthened, and steamboat traffic became common. Industrialization was delayed in comparison to Britain and Belgium. The railway system had yet to make an appearance. Industry was heavily protected with tariffs, so there was little demand for entrepreneurship or innovation.\nCulture flourished with the new romantic impulses. Oratory was highly regarded, and sophisticated debate flourished. Ch\u00e2teaubriand and Madame de Stael (1766\u20131817) enjoyed Europe-wide reputations for their innovations in romantic literature. She made important contributions to political sociology, and the sociology of literature. History flourished; Fran\u00e7ois Guizot, Benjamin Constant and Madame de Sta\u00ebl drew lessons from the past to guide the future. The paintings of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix set the standards for romantic art. Music, theater, science, and philosophy all flourished. Higher learning flourished at the Sorbonne. Major new institutions gave France world leadership in numerous advanced fields, as typified by the \u00c9cole Nationale des Chartes (1821) for historiography, the \u00c9cole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures in 1829 for innovative engineering; and the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts for the fine arts, reestablished in 1830.\nCharles X repeatedly exacerbated internal tensions, and tried to neutralize his enemies with repressive measures. They totally failed and forced him into exile for the third time. However the government's handling of foreign affairs was a success. France kept a low profile, and Europe forgot its animosities. Louis and Charles had little interest in foreign affairs, so France played only minor roles. For example, it helped the other powers deal with Greece and Turkey. Charles X mistakenly thought that foreign glory would cover domestic frustration, so he made an all-out effort to conquer Algiers in 1830. He sent a massive force of 38,000 soldiers and 4,500 horses carried by 103 warships and 469 merchant ships. The expedition was a dramatic military success. It even paid for itself with captured treasures. The episode launched the second French colonial empire, but it did not provide desperately needed political support for the King at home.\nRestoration in recent popular culture.\nThe 2007 French historical film \"Jacquou le Croquant\", directed by Laurent Boutonnat and starring Gaspard Ulliel and Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze, is based on the Bourbon Restoration.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* \n* \n* \n* \nHistoriography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a metasyntax for context-free grammars, providing a precise way to outline the rules of a language's structure.\nIt has been widely used in official specifications, manuals, and textbooks on programming language theory, as well as to describe document formats, instruction sets, and communication protocols. Over time, variations such as extended Backus\u2013Naur form (EBNF) and augmented Backus\u2013Naur form (ABNF) have emerged, building on the original framework with added features.\nStructure.\nBNF specifications outline how symbols are combined to form syntactically valid sequences. Each BNF consists of three core components: a set of non-terminal symbols, a set of terminal symbols, and a series of derivation rules. Non-terminal symbols represent categories or variables that can be replaced, while terminal symbols are the fixed, literal elements (such as keywords or punctuation) that appear in the final sequence. Derivation rules provide the instructions for replacing non-terminal symbols with specific combinations of symbols.\nA derivation rule is written in the format: codice_1\nwhere:\nFor example, in the rule , the entire line is the derivation rule, \"Sr.\", \"Jr.\", and \"\" (an empty string) are terminal symbols, and is a non-terminal symbol.\nGenerating a valid sequence involves starting with a designated start symbol and iteratively applying the derivation rules. This process can extend sequences incrementally. To allow flexibility, some BNF definitions include an optional \"delete\" symbol (represented as an empty alternative, e.g., ), enabling the removal of certain elements while maintaining syntactic validity.\nExample.\nA practical illustration of BNF is a specification for a simplified U.S. postal address:\n &lt;postal-address&gt; ::= &lt;name-part&gt; &lt;street-address&gt; &lt;zip-part&gt;\n &lt;name-part&gt; ::= &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;last-name&gt; &lt;opt-suffix-part&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; | &lt;personal-part&gt; &lt;name-part&gt;\n &lt;personal-part&gt; ::= &lt;first-name&gt; | &lt;initial&gt; \".\"\n &lt;street-address&gt; ::= &lt;house-num&gt; &lt;street-name&gt; &lt;opt-apt-num&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;\n &lt;zip-part&gt; ::= &lt;town-name&gt; \",\" &lt;state-code&gt; &lt;ZIP-code&gt; &lt;EOL&gt;\n&lt;opt-suffix-part&gt; ::= \"Sr.\" | \"Jr.\" | &lt;roman-numeral&gt; | \"\"\n &lt;opt-apt-num&gt; ::= \"Apt\" &lt;apt-num&gt; | \"\"\nThis translates into English as:\nNote that many things (such as the format of a first-name, apartment number, ZIP-code, and Roman numeral) are left unspecified here. If necessary, they may be described using additional BNF rules.\nHistory.\nThe concept of using rewriting rules to describe language structure traces back to at least P\u0101\u1e47ini, an ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian who lived sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BC. His notation for describing Sanskrit word structure is equivalent in power to that of BNF and exhibits many similar properties.\nIn Western society, grammar was long regarded as a subject for teaching rather than scientific study; descriptions were informal and targeted at practical usage. This perspective shifted in the first half of the 20th century, when linguists such as Leonard Bloomfield and Zellig Harris began attempts to formalize language description, including phrase structure. Meanwhile, mathematicians explored related ideas through string rewriting rules as formal logical systems, such as Axel Thue in 1914, Emil Post in the 1920s\u201340s, and Alan Turing in 1936. Noam Chomsky, teaching linguistics to students of information theory at MIT combined linguistics and mathematics, adapting Thue's formalism to describe natural language syntax. In 1956, he introduced a clear distinction between generative rules (those of context-free grammars) and transformation rules.\nBNF itself emerged when John Backus, a programming language designer at IBM, proposed a metalanguage of \"metalinguistic formulas\" to define the syntax of the new programming language IAL, known today as ALGOL 58, in 1959. This notation was formalized in the ALGOL 60 report, where Peter Naur named it \"Backus normal form\" in the committee's 1963 report. Whether Backus was directly influenced by Chomsky's work is uncertain.\nDonald Knuth argued in 1964 that BNF should be read as \"Backus\u2013Naur form\", as it is \"not a normal form in the conventional sense,\" unlike Chomsky normal form. In 1967, Peter Zilahy Ingerman suggested renaming it \"P\u0101\u1e47ini Backus form\" to acknowledge P\u0101\u1e47ini's earlier, independent development of a similar notation.\nIn the ALGOL 60 report, Naur described BNF as a \"metalinguistic formula\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sequences of characters enclosed in the brackets &lt;&gt; represent metalinguistic variables whose values are sequences of symbols. The marks \"::\n\" and \"|\" (the latter with the meaning of \"or\") are metalinguistic connectives. Any mark in a formula, which is not a variable or a connective, denotes itself. Juxtaposition of marks or variables in a formula signifies juxtaposition of the sequence denoted.\nThis is exemplified in the report's section 2.3, where comments are specified:For the purpose of including text among the symbols of a program the following \"comment\" conventions hold:\nEquivalence here means that any of the three structures shown in the left column may be replaced, in any occurrence outside of strings, by the symbol shown in the same line in the right column without any effect on the action of the program.\nNaur altered Backus's original symbols for ALGOL 60, changing codice_4 to codice_5 and the overbarred \"or\" to codice_6, using commonly available characters.\nBNF is very similar to canonical-form Boolean algebra equations (used in logic-circuit design), reflecting Backus's mathematical background as a FORTRAN designer. Studies of Boolean algebra were commonly part of a mathematics curriculum, which may have informed Backus's approach. Neither Backus nor Naur described the names enclosed in codice_7 as non-terminals\u2014Chomsky's terminology was not originally used in describing BNF. Naur later called them \"classes\" in 1961 course materials. In the ALGOL 60 report, they were \"metalinguistic variables,\" with other symbols defining the target language.\nSaul Rosen, involved with the Association for Computing Machinery since 1947, contributed to the transition from IAL to ALGOL and edited Communications of the ACM. He described BNF as a metalanguage for ALGOL in his 1967 book. Early ALGOL manuals from IBM, Honeywell, Burroughs, and Digital Equipment Corporation followed this usage.\nImpact.\nBNF significantly influenced programming language development, notably as the basis for early compiler-compiler systems. Examples include Edgar T. Irons' \"A Syntax Directed Compiler for ALGOL 60\" and Brooker and Morris' \"A Compiler Building System,\" which directly utilized BNF. Others, like Schorre's META II, adapted BNF into a programming language, replacing codice_7 with quoted strings and adding operators like $ for repetition, as in: EXPR = TERM $('+' TERM .OUT('ADD') | '-' TERM .OUT('SUB')); \nThis influenced tools like yacc, a widely used parser generator rooted in BNF principles. BNF remains one of the oldest computer-related notations still referenced today, though its variants often dominate modern applications.\nExamples of its use as a metalanguage include defining arithmetic expressions: &lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;expr&gt; &lt;addop&gt; &lt;term&gt; Here, can recursively include itself, allowing repeated additions.\nBNF today is one of the oldest computer-related languages still in use.\nBNF representation of itself.\n tright\" style=\"width:282px;\"&gt;\nBNF syntax diagram\nBNF's syntax itself may be represented with a BNF like the following:\n&lt;syntax&gt; ::= &lt;rule&gt; | &lt;rule&gt; &lt;syntax&gt;\n&lt;rule&gt; ::= &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; \"&lt;\" &lt;rule-name&gt; \"&gt;\" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; \"::=\" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;expression&gt; &lt;line-end&gt;\n&lt;opt-whitespace&gt; ::= \" \" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; | \"\"\n&lt;expression&gt; ::= &lt;list&gt; | &lt;list&gt; &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; \"|\" &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;expression&gt;\n&lt;line-end&gt; ::= &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;EOL&gt; | &lt;line-end&gt; &lt;line-end&gt;\n&lt;list&gt; ::= &lt;term&gt; | &lt;term&gt; &lt;opt-whitespace&gt; &lt;list&gt;\n&lt;term&gt; ::= &lt;literal&gt; | \"&lt;\" &lt;rule-name&gt; \"&gt;\"\n&lt;literal&gt; ::= '\"' &lt;text1&gt; '\"' | \"'\" &lt;text2&gt; \"'\"\n&lt;text1&gt; ::= \"\" | &lt;character1&gt; &lt;text1&gt;\n&lt;text2&gt; ::= \"\" | &lt;character2&gt; &lt;text2&gt;\n&lt;character&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; | &lt;symbol&gt;\n&lt;letter&gt; ::= \"A\" | \"B\" | \"C\" | \"D\" | \"E\" | \"F\" | \"G\" | \"H\" | \"I\" | \"J\" | \"K\" | \"L\" | \"M\" | \"N\" | \"O\" | \"P\" | \"Q\" | \"R\" | \"S\" | \"T\" | \"U\" | \"V\" | \"W\" | \"X\" | \"Y\" | \"Z\" | \"a\" | \"b\" | \"c\" | \"d\" | \"e\" | \"f\" | \"g\" | \"h\" | \"i\" | \"j\" | \"k\" | \"l\" | \"m\" | \"n\" | \"o\" | \"p\" | \"q\" | \"r\" | \"s\" | \"t\" | \"u\" | \"v\" | \"w\" | \"x\" | \"y\" | \"z\"\n&lt;digit&gt; ::= \"0\" | \"1\" | \"2\" | \"3\" | \"4\" | \"5\" | \"6\" | \"7\" | \"8\" | \"9\"\n&lt;symbol&gt; ::= \"|\" | \" \" | \"!\" | \"#\" | \"$\" | \"%\" | \"&amp;\" | \"(\" | \")\" | \"*\" | \"+\" | \",\" | \"-\" | \".\" | \"/\" | \":\" | \";\" | \"&gt;\" | \"=\" | \"&lt;\" | \"?\" | \"@\" | \"[\" | \"\\\" | \"]\" | \"^\" | \"_\" | \"`\" | \"{\" | \"}\" | \"~\"\n&lt;character1&gt; ::= &lt;character&gt; | \"'\"\n&lt;character2&gt; ::= &lt;character&gt; | '\"'\n&lt;rule-name&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;rule-name&gt; &lt;rule-char&gt;\n&lt;rule-char&gt; ::= &lt;letter&gt; | &lt;digit&gt; | \"-\"\nNote that \"\" is the empty string.\nThe original BNF did not use quotes as shown in codice_9 rule. This assumes that no whitespace is necessary for proper interpretation of the rule.\ncodice_10 represents the appropriate line-end specifier (in ASCII, carriage-return, line-feed or both depending on the operating system). codice_11 and codice_12 are to be substituted with a declared rule's name/label or literal text, respectively.\nIn the U.S. postal address example above, the entire block-quote is a codice_13. Each line or unbroken grouping of lines is a rule; for example one rule begins with codice_14. The other part of that rule (aside from a line-end) is an expression, which consists of two lists separated by a vertical bar codice_6. These two lists consists of some terms (three terms and two terms, respectively). Each term in this particular rule is a rule-name.\nVariants.\nEBNF.\nThere are many variants and extensions of BNF, generally either for the sake of simplicity and succinctness, or to adapt it to a specific application. One common feature of many variants is the use of regular expression repetition operators such as codice_16 and codice_17. The extended Backus\u2013Naur form (EBNF) is a common one.\nAnother common extension is the use of square brackets around optional items. Although not present in the original ALGOL 60 report (instead introduced a few years later in IBM's PL/I definition), the notation is now universally recognised.\nABNF.\nAugmented Backus\u2013Naur form (ABNF) and Routing Backus\u2013Naur form (RBNF) are extensions commonly used to describe Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols.\nParsing expression grammars build on the BNF and regular expression notations to form an alternative class of formal grammar, which is essentially analytic rather than generative in character.\nOthers.\nMany BNF specifications found online today are intended to be human-readable and are non-formal. These often include many of the following syntax rules and extensions:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are notable for the groups of cilia they use for swimming (commonly referred to as \"combs\"), and they are the largest animals to swim with the help of cilia.\nDepending on the species, adult ctenophores range from a few millimeters to in size. 186\u00a0living species are recognised.\nTheir bodies consist of a mass of jelly, with a layer two cells thick on the outside, and another lining the internal cavity. The phylum has a wide range of body forms, including the egg-shaped cydippids with a pair of retractable tentacles that capture prey, the flat, generally combless platyctenids, and the large-mouthed beroids, which prey on other ctenophores.\nAlmost all ctenophores function as predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the salps on which adults of their species feed.\nDespite their soft, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent ctenophores appear in Lagerst\u00e4tten (well-preserved fossil beds) dating as far back as the early Cambrian, about 525 million years ago. The position of the ctenophores in the \"tree of life\" has long been debated in molecular phylogenetics studies. Biologists proposed that ctenophores constitute the second-earliest branching animal lineage, with sponges being the sister-group to all other multicellular animals (\"Porifera sister hypothesis\"). Other biologists contend that ctenophores diverged earlier than sponges (\"Ctenophora sister hypothesis\"), which themselves appeared before the split between cnidarians and bilaterians. Pisani \"et al\". reanalyzed the data and suggested that the computer algorithms used for analysis were misled by the presence of specific ctenophore genes that were markedly different from those of other species. However, follow up analysis by Whelan et al. (2017) yielded support for the 'Ctenophora sister' hypothesis; the issue remains a matter of taxonomic dispute. Schultz \"et al.\" (2023) found irreversible changes in synteny in the sister of the Ctenophora, the Myriazoa, consisting of the rest of the animals.\nEtymology.\nThe New Latin name is constructed from grc \" \"\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 (kteis)'\u00a0'comb' and \" \"\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9 (pher\u014d)'\u00a0'to carry', alluding to the rows of cilia that are distinctive features of animals in the phylum.\nDistinguishing features.\nCtenophores are distinguished from all other animals by having colloblasts, which are sticky and adhere to prey, although a few ctenophore species lack them.\nLike cnidarians, ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material, which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, and as a result some text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic. The comb jellies have more than 80\u00a0different cell types, exceeding the numbers from other groups like placozoans, sponges, cnidarians, and some deep-branching bilaterians.\nRanging from about to in size, ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia as their main method of locomotion. Most species have eight strips, called comb rows, that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia, called \"ctenes\", stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat, those of each comb touch the comb below. The name \"ctenophora\" means \"comb-bearing\", from the Greek ' (stem-form ) meaning \"comb\" and the Greek suffix ' meaning \"carrying\".\nDescription.\nFor a phylum with relatively few species, ctenophores have a wide range of body plans. Coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles, while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study. In addition, oceanic species do not preserve well, and are known mainly from photographs and from observers' notes. Hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera \u2013 \"Pleurobrachia\", \"Beroe\" and \"Mnemiopsis\". At least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid \"Pleurobrachia\".\nSince the body of many species is \"almost\" radially symmetrical, the main axis is oral to aboral (from the mouth to the opposite end). However, since only two of the canals near the statocyst terminate in anal pores, ctenophores have no mirror-symmetry, although many have rotational symmetry. In other words, if the animal rotates in a half-circle it looks the same as when it started.\nBody layers.\nLike those of cnidarians, (jellyfish, sea anemones, etc.), ctenophores' bodies consist of a relatively thick, jelly-like mesoglea sandwiched between two epithelia, layers of cells bound by inter-cell connections and by a fibrous basement membrane that they secrete. The epithelia of ctenophores have two layers of cells rather than one, and some of the cells in the upper layer have several cilia per cell.\nThe outer layer of the epidermis (outer skin) consists of: sensory cells; cells that secrete mucus, which protects the body; and interstitial cells, which can transform into other types of cell. In specialized parts of the body, the outer layer contains colloblasts along the surface of tentacles, used in capturing prey, or cells bearing multiple large cilia for locomotion. The inner layer of the epidermis contains a nerve net, and myoepithelial cells that act as muscles.\nThe internal cavity forms: a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles; a pharynx (\"throat\"); a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach; and a system of internal canals. These branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal. The inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium, the gastrodermis. The mouth and pharynx have both cilia and muscles. In other parts of the canal system, the gastrodermis is different on the sides nearest to and furthest from the organ that it supplies. The nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles (internal compartments), germ cells that produce eggs or sperm, and photocytes that produce bioluminescence. The side furthest from the organ is covered with ciliated cells that circulate water through the canals, punctuated by ciliary rosettes, pores surrounded by double whorls of cilia and connected to the mesoglea.\nFeeding, excretion and respiration.\nWhen prey is swallowed, it is liquefied in the pharynx by enzymes and muscular contractions of the pharynx. The resulting slurry is wafted through the canal system by the beating of the cilia, and digested by the nutritive cells. The ciliary rosettes may help to transport nutrients to muscles in the mesoglea. The anal pores may eject unwanted small particles, but most unwanted matter is regurgitated via the mouth.\nLittle is known about how ctenophores get rid of waste products produced by the cells. The ciliary rosettes in the gastrodermis may help to remove wastes from the mesoglea, and may also help to adjust the animal's buoyancy by pumping water into or out of the mesoglea.\nLocomotion.\nThe outer surface bears usually eight comb rows, called swimming-plates, which are used for swimming. The rows are oriented to run from near the mouth (the \"oral pole\") to the opposite end (the \"aboral pole\"), and are spaced more or less evenly around the body, although spacing patterns vary by species and in most species the comb rows extend only part of the distance from the aboral pole towards the mouth. The \"combs\" (also called \"ctenes\" or \"comb plates\") run across each row, and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia, up to . Unlike conventional cilia and flagella, which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern, these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern, where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function. These normally beat so that the propulsion stroke is away from the mouth, although they can also reverse direction. Hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is eating, unlike jellyfish. \nIt is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense brackish water, the ciliary rosettes may pump this into the mesoglea to maintain buoyancy. Conversely, if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea.\nNervous system and senses.\nCtenophores have no brain or central nervous system, but have a subepidermal nerve net that forms a ring round the mouth and is densest near structures such as the comb rows, pharynx, tentacles and the sensory complex furthest from the mouth. Nerve cells communicate by two different methods; some of the neurons have synaptic connections, but those in the nerve net are highly distinctive by being fused into a syncytium. Fossils show that Cambrian species had a more complex nervous system, with long nerves which connected with a ring around the mouth. The only ctenophores with long nerves today is \"Euplokamis\" in the order Cydippida. Their nerve cells arise from the same progenitor cells as the colloblasts.\nIn addition, there is a less organized mesogleal nerve net consisting of single neurites. The largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ (at the opposite end from the mouth), which is underlined with its own nerve net. This organ's main component is a statocyst, a balance sensor consisting of a statolith, a tiny grain of calcium carbonate, supported on four bundles of cilia, called \"balancers\", that sense its orientation. The statocyst is protected by a transparent dome of long, immobile cilia. A ctenophore does not automatically try to keep the statolith resting equally on all the balancers. Instead, its response is determined by the animal's \"mood\", in other words, the overall state of the nervous system. For example, if a ctenophore with trailing tentacles captures prey, it often puts some comb rows into reverse, spinning the mouth towards the prey.\nThe ciliated larvae in cnidarians and bilaterians appear to share an ancient and common origin. The larvae's apical organ is involved in the formation of the nervous system. The aboral organ of comb jellies is not homologous with the apical organ in other animals, and the formation of their nervous system has therefore a different embryonic origin.\nCtenophore nerve cells and nervous system have distinctive biochemistry. They lack the genes and enzymes required to manufacture neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, nitric oxide, octopamine, noradrenaline, and others, seen in all other animals with a nervous system, with the genes coding for the receptors for each of these neurotransmitters missing. Monofunctional catalase (CAT), one of the three major families of antioxidant enzymes that target hydrogen peroxide, an important signaling molecule for synaptic and neuronal activity, is also absent, most likely due to gene loss. They use L-glutamate as a neurotransmitter, and have a distinctively high number of ionotropic glutamate receptors and genes for glutamate synthesis and transport. The genomic content of the nervous system is the smallest of any animal, and could represent the minimum genetic requirements for a functional nervous system. The presence of directly fused neurons without synapses suggests that ctenophores might form a sister group to other metazoans, having developed a nervous system independently. If so, nervous systems may have either been lost in sponges and placozoans, or arisen more than once among metazoans.\nReproduction and development.\nAdults of most species can regenerate tissues that are damaged or removed, although only platyctenids reproduce by cloning, splitting off from the edges of their flat bodies fragments that develop into new individuals. Lab research on \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\" also show that when two individuals have parts of their bodies removed, they are able to fuse together, including their nervous and digestive systems, even when the two individuals are genetically different; a phenomenon so far only found in comb jellies.\nThe last common ancestor (LCA) of the ctenophores was hermaphroditic. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. There is no metamorphosis. At least three species are known to have evolved separate sexes (dioecy); \"Ocyropsis crystallina\" and \"Ocyropsis maculata\" in the genus Ocyropsis and \"Bathocyroe fosteri\" in the genus Bathocyroe. The gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus \"Mnemiopsis\", and most hermaphroditic species are presumed to be self-fertile.\nDevelopment of the fertilized eggs is direct; there is no distinctive larval form. Juveniles of all groups are generally planktonic, and most species resemble miniature adult cydippids, gradually developing their adult body forms as they grow. In the genus \"Beroe\", however, the juveniles have large mouths and, like the adults, lack both tentacles and tentacle sheaths. In some groups, such as the flat, bottom-dwelling platyctenids, the juveniles behave more like true larvae. They live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents, only attaining the adult form by a more radical ontogeny after dropping to the sea-floor.\nAt least in some species, juvenile ctenophores appear capable of producing small quantities of eggs and sperm while they are well below adult size, and adults produce eggs and sperm for as long as they have sufficient food. If they run short of food, they first stop producing eggs and sperm, and then shrink in size. When the food supply improves, they grow back to normal size and then resume reproduction. These features enable ctenophores to increase their populations very quickly. Members of the Lobata and Cydippida have a reproduction form called dissogeny; two sexually mature stages, first as larva and later as juveniles and adults. During their time as larvae they release gametes periodically. After their first reproductive period is over they do not produce more gametes until later. A population of \"Mertensia ovum\" in the central Baltic Sea have become paedogenetic, and consist solely of sexually mature larvae less than 1.6\u00a0mm.\nIn \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\", nitric oxide (NO) signaling is present both in adult tissues and differentially expressed in later embryonic stages suggesting the involvement of NO in developmental mechanisms. The mature form of the same species is also able to revert back to the cydippid stage when triggered by environmental stressors.\nColors and bioluminescence.\nMost ctenophores that live near the surface are mostly colorless and almost transparent. However some deeper-living species are strongly pigmented, for example the species known as \"Tortugas red\" (see illustration here), which has not yet been formally described. Platyctenids generally live attached to other sea-bottom organisms, and often have similar colors to these host organisms. The gut of the deep-sea genus \"Bathocyroe\" is red, which hides the bioluminescence of copepods it has swallowed.\nThe comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus \"Pleurobrachia\", are incapable of bioluminescence.\nWhen some species, including \"Bathyctena chuni\", \"Euplokamis stationis\" and \"Eurhamphaea vexilligera\", are disturbed, they produce secretions (ink) that luminesce at much the same wavelengths as their bodies. Juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults, whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies. Detailed statistical investigation has not suggested the function of ctenophores' bioluminescence nor produced any correlation between its exact color and any aspect of the animals' environments, such as depth or whether they live in coastal or mid-ocean waters.\nIn ctenophores, bioluminescence is caused by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\" ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with opsin genes in the developing photocytes of \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\", raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.\nEcology.\nDistribution.\nCtenophores are found in most marine environments: from polar waters at \u22122\u00a0\u00b0C to the tropics at 30\u00a0\u00b0C; near coasts and in mid-ocean; from the surface waters to the ocean depths at more than 7000 meters. The best-understood are the genera \"Pleurobrachia\", \"Beroe\" and \"Mnemiopsis\", as these planktonic coastal forms are among the most likely to be collected near shore.\nIn 2013 \"Mnemiopsis\" was recorded in lake Birket Qarun, and in 2014 in lake El Rayan II, both near Faiyum in Egypt, where they were accidentally introduced by the transport of fish (mullet) fry. Though many species prefer brackish waters like estuaries and coastal lagoons in open connection with the sea, this was the first record from an inland environment. Both lakes are saline, with Birket Qarun being hypersaline, and shows that some ctenophores can establish themselves in saline limnic environments without connection to the ocean. In the long run, it is not expected the populations will survive. The two limiting factors in saline lakes are availability of food and a varied diet, and high temperatures during hot summers. Because a parasitic isopod, \"Livoneca redmanii\", was introduced at the same time, it is difficult to say how much of the ecological impact of invasive species is caused by the ctenophore alone.\nPrey and predators.\nAlmost all ctenophores are predators \u2013 there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic. If food is plentiful, they can eat ten times their own weight per day. While \"Beroe\" preys mainly on other ctenophores, other surface-water species prey on zooplankton (planktonic animals) ranging in size from the microscopic, including mollusc and fish larvae, to small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. Members of the genus \"Haeckelia\" prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in their wide range of techniques for capturing prey \u2013 some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some are ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide range of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. \nThe two-tentacled \"cydippid\" \"Lampea\" feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles of \"Lampea\" attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow. Members of the cydippid genus \"Pleurobrachia\" and the lobate \"Bolinopsis\" often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: \"Pleurobrachia\"'s long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while \"Bolinopsis\" generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.\nIt is often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators as they are broken down quickly, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Chum salmon, \"Oncorhynchus keta\", digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps; ctenophores can provide the fish with a good diet if there are enough of them around. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists and may have a greater effect on populations than specialist jelly-eaters. Herbivorous fishes deliberately feed on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood.\nEcological impacts.\nCtenophores may balance marine ecosystems by preventing an over-abundance of copepods from eating all the phytoplankton (planktonic plants), which are the dominant marine producers of organic matter from non-organic ingredients.\nOn the other hand, in the late 1980s the Western Atlantic ctenophore \"Mnemiopsis leidyi\" was accidentally introduced into the Black Sea and Sea of Azov via the ballast tanks of ships, and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish. \"Mnemiopsis\" is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the \"Mnemiopsis\" population to increase even faster than normal \u2013 and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. \"Mnemiopsis\" populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the \"Mnemiopsis\"-eating North American ctenophore \"Beroe ovata\", and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism. However the abundance of plankton in the area seems unlikely to be restored to pre-\"Mnemiopsis\" levels.\nIn the late 1990s \"Mnemiopsis\" appeared in the Caspian Sea. \"Beroe ovata\" arrived shortly after, and is expected to reduce but not eliminate the impact of \"Mnemiopsis\" there. \"Mnemiopsis\" also reached the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1990s and now appears to be thriving in the North Sea and Baltic Sea.\nTaxonomy.\nThe number of known living ctenophore species is uncertain since many of those named and formally described have turned out to be identical to species known under other scientific names. Claudia Mills estimates that there about 100\u2013150\u00a0valid species that are not duplicates, and that at least another\u00a025, mostly deep-sea forms, have been recognized as distinct but not yet analyzed in enough detail to support a formal description and naming.\nEarly classification.\nEarly writers combined ctenophores with cnidarians into a single phylum called Coelenterata on account of morphological similarities between the two groups. Like cnidarians, the bodies of ctenophores consist of a mass of jelly, with one layer of cells on the outside and another lining the internal cavity. In ctenophores, however, these layers are two cells deep, while those in cnidarians are only a single cell deep. Ctenophores also resemble cnidarians in relying on water flow through the body cavity for both digestion and respiration, as well as in having a decentralized nerve net rather than a brain. Genomic studies have suggested that the neurons of Ctenophora, which differ in many ways from other animal neurons, evolved independently from those of the other animals.\nModern taxonomy.\nThe traditional classification divides ctenophores into two classes, those with tentacles (Tentaculata) and those without (Nuda). The Nuda contains only one order (Beroida) and family (Beroidae), and two genera, \"Beroe\" (several species) and \"Neis\" (one species).\nThe Tentaculata are divided into the following eight orders:\nEvolutionary history.\nDespite their fragile, gelatinous bodies, fossils thought to represent ctenophores \u2013 apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms \u2013 have been found in Lagerst\u00e4tten as far back as the early Cambrian, about https://\u00a0million years ago. Nevertheless, a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concludes that the common ancestor originated approximately 350\u00a0million years ago\u2009\u00b1\u200988\u00a0million years ago, conflicting with previous estimates which suggests it occurred https://\u00a0million years ago after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event.\nThe following cladogram shows hypothesized relationships among some of the more well-understood members of the Ctenophora stem group, with the Dinomischidae seen as a paraphyletic grade:\nFossil record.\nBecause of their soft, gelatinous bodies, ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils, and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in Lagerst\u00e4tten, places where the environment was exceptionally suited to the preservation of soft tissue. Until the mid-1990s, only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the early Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shale and other Canadian rocks of similar age, about https://\u00a0million years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three lacked tentacles but had between 24\u201380\u00a0comb rows, far more than the eight typical of living species. They also appear to have had internal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the fossil species first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edge that may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cambrian, but perhaps very different from modern species \u2013 for example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. The youngest fossil of a species outside the crown group is \"Daihuoides\" from the late Devonian, which belongs to a basal group that had been assumed to have gone extinct more than 140 million years earlier.\nThe Ediacaran \"Eoandromeda\" could putatively represent a comb jelly. It has eightfold symmetry, with eight spiral arms resembling the comblike rows of a ctenophore. If it is indeed ctenophore, it places the group close to the origin of the Bilateria.\nThe early Cambrian sessile frond-like fossil \"Stromatoveris\", from China's Chengjiang lagerst\u00e4tte and dated to about https://\u00a0million years ago, is very similar to Vendobionta of the preceding Ediacaran period. De-Gan Shu, Simon Conway Morris, \"et al.\" found on its branches what they considered rows of cilia, used for filter feeding. They suggested that \"Stromatoveris\" was an evolutionary \"aunt\" of ctenophores, and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system. Other Cambrian fossils that support the idea of ctenophores having evolved from sessile forms are \"Dinomischus\", \"Daihua\", \"Xianguangia\" and \"Siphusauctum\" which also lived on the seafloor, had organic skeletons and cilia-covered tentacles surrounding their mouth, which have been found by cladistic analysis as members of the ctenophore stem-group\n520\u00a0million-year-old Cambrian fossils also from Chengjiang in China show a now wholly extinct class of ctenophore, named \"Scleroctenophora\", that had a complex internal skeleton with long spines. The skeleton also supported eight soft-bodied flaps, which could have been used for swimming and possibly feeding. One form, \"Thaumactena\", had a streamlined body resembling that of arrow worms and could have been an agile swimmer.\nRelationship to other animal groups.\nThe phylogenetic relationship of ctenophores to the rest of Metazoa is very important to our understanding of the early evolution of animals and the origin of multicellularity. It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Bilateria, and sister to all other animals.\nWalter Garstang in his book \"Larval Forms and Other Zoological Verses\" (\"M\u00fclleria and the Ctenophore\") even expressed a theory that ctenophores were descended from a neotenic \"M\u00fclleria\" larva of a polyclad.\nA series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) suggest that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. \nSeveral more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes support ctenophores as sister to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types either were lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera and Placozoa) or evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.\nOther researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera is the earliest-diverging animal taxon instead (a \"sponge sister\" topology).They also have extremely high rates of mitochondrial evolution,and the smallest known RNA/protein content of the mtDNA genome in animals. As such, the Ctenophora appear to be a basal diploblast clade. In agreement with the latter point, the analysis of a very large sequence alignment at the metazoan taxonomic scale (1,719\u00a0proteins totalizing acid positions) in Simion \"et al.\" (2017) showed that ctenophores emerge as the second-earliest branching animal lineage, and sponges are sister to all other multicellular animals. Research on mucin genes shows that sponges have never had them while all other animals, including comb jellies, do.\nDespite all their differences, ctenophoran neurons share the same foundation as cnidarian neurons after findings shows that peptide-expressing neurons are probably ancestral to chemical neurotransmitters.\nThe issue with the \"rate of evolution\" counterargument is that it mainly affects analyses based on the sequence of genes, not those based on gene family presence or synteny, both of which have produced results in support of the \"Ctenophora sister\" theory. Even with sequence-based analyses, the biases can also be corrected for: Whelan \"et al.\" (2017), using such an approach, strongly rejects the hypothesis that sponges are the sister group to all other extant animals and establishes the placement of Ctenophora as the sister group to all other animals, and disagreement with Simion \"et al.\" (2017) is explained by methodological problems in analyses in that work. Synteny analysis by Schultz \"et al.\" (2023) supports the same result.\nNeither ctenophores nor sponges possess HIF pathways, their genome express only a single type of voltage-gated calcium channel unlike other animals which have three types, and they are the only known animal phyla that lack any true Hox genes. A few species from other phyla; the nemertean pilidium larva, the larva of the phoronid species \"Phoronopsis harmeri\" and the acorn worm larva \"Schizocardium californicum\", do not depend on Hox genes in their larval development either, but need them during metamorphosis to reach their adult form. Innexin genes, which code for proteins used for intercellular communication in animals, also appears to have evolved independently in ctenophores.\nInternal phylogeny.\nRelationships within Ctenophora (2001).\nRelationships within Ctenophora (2017).\nSince all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids, having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles. Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead, he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. \nA molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including four recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event https://\u00a0million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain. A 2017 study corroborates the paraphyly of Cydippida but finds that Lobata is paraphyletic with respect to Cestida.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Together with the small islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, it constitutes the Town and County of Nantucket, a combined county/town government. Nantucket is the southeasternmost town in both Massachusetts and the New England region. The name \"Nantucket\" is adapted from similar Algonquian names for the island.\nNantucket is a tourist destination and summer colony. Due to tourists and seasonal residents, the population of the island increases to around 80,000 during the summer months. The average sale price for a single-family home was $2.3 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe National Park Service cites Nantucket, designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1966, as being the \"finest surviving architectural and environmental example of a late 18th- and early 19th-century New England seaport town.\"\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nNantucket probably takes its name from a Wampanoag word, transliterated variously as \"natocke\", \"nantaticu\", \"nantican\", \"nautica\" or \"natockete\", which is part of Wampanoag lore about the creation of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket. The meaning of the term is uncertain, although according to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" it may have meant \"far away island\" or \"sandy, sterile soil tempting no one\". Wampanoag is an Eastern Algonquian language of southern New England. The Nehantucket (known to Europeans as the Niantic) were an Algonquin-speaking people of the area.\nNantucket's nickname, \"The Little Grey Lady of the Sea\", refers to the island as it appears from the ocean when it is fog-bound.\nEuropean colonization.\nThe earliest European colonial settlement in the region was established on the neighboring island of Martha's Vineyard by the English-born merchant Thomas Mayhew. In 1641, Mayhew secured Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands, and other islands in the region as a proprietary colony from Sir Ferdinando Gorges and the Earl of Stirling. Mayhew led several families to settle the region, establishing several treaties with the indigenous inhabitants of Nantucket, the Wampanoag people. These treaties helped prevent the region from becoming embroiled in King Philip's War. The growing population of settlers welcomed seasonal groups of other Native American tribes who traveled to the island to fish and later harvest whales that washed up on shore. Nantucket was officially part of Dukes County, New York, until October 17, 1691, when the charter for the newly formed Province of Massachusetts Bay was signed. Following the arrival of the new Royal Governor on May 14, 1692, to effectuate the new government, Nantucket County was partitioned from Dukes County, Massachusetts in 1695.\nNantucket settlers.\nEuropean settlement of Nantucket did not begin in earnest until 1659, when Thomas Mayhew sold nine-tenths of his interest to a group of investors, led by Tristram Coffin, \"for the sum of thirty pounds (equal to \u00a3 today) also two beaver hats, one for myself, and one for my wife\".\nThe nine original purchasers were Tristram Coffin, Peter Coffin, Thomas Macy, Christopher Hussey, Richard Swain, Thomas Barnard, Stephen Greenleaf, John Swain and William Pile. Mayhew and the nine purchasers then each took on partners in the venture. These additional shareholders were Tristram Coffin Junior, James Coffin, John Smith, Robert Pike, Thomas Look, Robert Barnard, Edward Starbuck, Thomas Coleman, John Bishop and Thomas Mayhew Junior. These twenty men and their heirs were the Proprietors.\nAnxious to add to their number and to induce tradesmen to come to the island, the total number of shares was increased to twenty-seven. The original purchasers needed the assistance of tradesmen who were skilled in the arts of weaving, milling, building and other pursuits and selected men who were given half a share provided that they lived on Nantucket and carried on their trade for at least three years. By 1667, twenty-seven shares had been divided among 31 owners. Seamen and tradesmen who settled in Nantucket included Richard Gardner (arrived 1667) and Capt. John Gardner (arrived 1672), sons of Thomas Gardner. The first settlers focused on farming and raising sheep, but overgrazing and the growing number of farms made these activities untenable, and the islanders soon began turning to the sea for a living.\nSherburne.\nBefore 1795, the town on the island was called Sherburne. The original settlement was near Capaum Pond. At that time, the pond was a small harbor whose entrance silted up, forcing the settlers to dismantle their houses and move them northeast by two miles to the present location. On June 8, 1795, the bill proposed by Micajah Coffin to change the town's name to the \"Town of Nantucket\" was endorsed and signed by Governor Samuel Adams to officially change the town name.\nNew Guinea.\nThe early settlers brought enslaved African Americans to Nantucket. Although slavery was not abolished on the island until 1773, earlier in the century freed African Americans established a neighbourhood called New Guinea (later Newtown) on the south-west outskirts of the main town, near the windmills on Mill Hill. The community thrived during the 18th and 19th centuries, with shops, churches, a school and a dance hall as well as houses. The building on the corner of York and Pleasant Streets, founded in 1824 as a school, church and meeting-house, was acquired by the Museum of African American History in 1999. During the nineteenth century, Nantucket, which by this time was predominantly Quaker and supported the abolition of slavery, became part of the Underground Railroad, providing sanctuary to African Americans escaping slavery on the mainland. New Guinea was also home to Hawaiian Islanders who worked on the Nantucket whaleships, and to Wampanoags who had married into the African American community.\nThe Wampanoags.\nWhen English settlers arrived on Nantucket in 1659, the island was populated by Wampanoag Native Americans, one of the Indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands, who had been living there for thousands of years. As many as three thousand people lived on the island in groups governed by sachems. Within two years of their arrival, the settlers had persuaded two of the sachems, Wanackmamack and Nickanoose, to relinquish their rights to the island in exchange for 66 pounds sterling, equal to \u00a3 today).26-7 In 1750 the deeds were upheld by a judge from the General Court of Massachusetts in spite of petitions from the Wampanoags claiming that the sachems had not had the authority to sell the land.52 The Wampanoags converted to Christianity and took up trades that were useful to the settlers, becoming, for example, carpenters and weavers.40 When the whaling industry developed on Nantucket in the 18th century, Wampanoag men went to sea and often made up half or more of the crew of the whaling ships.44-6 By the beginning of the 18th century, a system of debt bondage had been implemented to provide local colonists with steady access to a pool of Wampanoag labor.\nDuring the century that followed the arrival of the settlers, the Wampanoag community did not thrive, and by 1763 they numbered only 358 people. Various factors contributed to this decline, including the destruction of the ecosystem that had sustained them, the disadvantages they faced in competing in the developing money economy, losses at sea, and the detrimental effect of rum on their health.45-6,54 In 1763 the Wampanoag community was struck down by an epidemic of unknown origin, which killed 222 of them while leaving local colonists unaffected. Some of the survivors left Nantucket and some married into the small African community on the island.52-4 Two children, Abram Quary and Dorcas Esop, who were born after the epidemic and lived until 1854 and 1855, have been acknowledged as Nantucket's last Native Americans. Wampanoags from Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod have since then lived on Nantucket.56\nIn 2021, the \"Nantucket Annual Town Meeting\" voted to replace the Columbus Day holiday with Indigenous People's Day.\nWhaling industry.\nIn his 1835 history of Nantucket Island, Obed Macy wrote that in the early pre-1672 colony, a whale of the kind called \"scragg\" entered the harbor and was pursued and killed by the settlers. This event started the Nantucket whaling industry. A. B. Van Deinse points out that the \"scrag whale\", described by P. Dudley in 1725 as one of the species hunted by early New England whalers, was almost certainly the gray whale, which has flourished on the west coast of North America in modern times with protection from whaling.\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, whaling on Nantucket was usually done from small boats launched from the island's shores, which would tow killed whales to be processed on the beach. These boats were only about seven meters long, with mostly Wampanoag manpower, sourced from a system of debt servitude established by local colonists\u2014a typical boat's crew had five Wampanoag oarsmen and a single white man at the steering oar. Author Nathaniel Philbrick notes that \"without the native population, which outnumbered the white population well into the 1720s, the island would never have become a successful whaling port.\"\nNantucket's dependence on trade with Britain, derived from its whaling and supporting industries, influenced its leading citizens to remain neutral during the American Revolutionary War, favoring neither the British nor the Patriots.\nHerman Melville commented on Nantucket's whaling dominance in his novel \"Moby-Dick\", Chapter 14: \"Two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer's. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires\". The \"Moby-Dick\" characters Ahab and Starbuck are both from Nantucket. The tragedy that inspired Melville to write \"Moby-Dick\" was the final voyage of the Nantucket whaler \"Essex\".\nThe island suffered great economic hardships, worsened by the \"Great Fire\" of July 13, 1846, that, fueled by whale oil and lumber, devastated the main town, burning some . The fire left hundreds homeless and poverty-stricken, and many people left the island. \nBy 1850, whaling was in decline, as Nantucket's whaling industry had been surpassed by that of New Bedford. Another contributor to the decline was the silting up of the harbor, which prevented large whaling ships from entering and leaving the port, unlike New Bedford, which still owned a deep water port. In addition, the development of railroads made mainland whaling ports, such as New Bedford, more attractive because of the ease of transshipment of whale oil onto trains, an advantage unavailable to an island. The onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849 further lured many of Nantucket\u2019s workers from whaling, as many islanders abandoned whaling in pursuit of opportunities in the West. The American Civil War dealt the death blow to the island's whaling industry, as virtually all of the remaining whaling vessels were destroyed by Confederate commerce raiders.\nLater history.\nAs a result of this depopulation, the island was left under-developed and isolated until the mid-20th century. Isolation from the mainland kept many of the pre-Civil War buildings intact and, by the 1950s, enterprising developers began buying up large sections of the island and restoring them to create an upmarket destination for wealthy people in the Northeastern United States.\nNantucket and towns on Martha's Vineyard contemplated seceding from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which they considered at various town meetings in 1977, unsuccessfully. The votes were sparked by a proposed change to the Massachusetts Constitution that would have reduced the size of the state's House of Representatives from 240 to 160 members and would therefore reduce the islands' representation in the Massachusetts General Court.\nGeology and geography.\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of , of which is land and (85%) is water. It is the smallest county in Massachusetts by land area and second-smallest by total area. The area of Nantucket Island proper is . The triangular region of ocean between Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard, and Cape Cod is Nantucket Sound. The highest points on the island include Saul's Hill at , Altar Rock at , and Sankaty Head at .\nNantucket was formed by the outermost reach of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the recent Wisconsin Glaciation, shaped by the subsequent rise in sea level. The low ridge across the northern section of the island was deposited as glacial moraine during a period of glacial standstill, a period during which till continued to arrive and was deposited as the glacier melted at a stationary front. The southern part of the island is an outwash plain, sloping away from the arc of the moraine and shaped at its margins by the sorting actions and transport of longshore drift. Nantucket became an island when rising sea levels covered the connection with the mainland, about 5,000\u20136,000 years ago.\nThe island and adjoining islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget comprise the Town and County of Nantucket, which is operated as a consolidated town and county government. The main settlement, also called Nantucket, is located at the western end of Nantucket Harbor, where it opens into Nantucket Sound. Key localities on the island include Madaket, Surfside, Polpis, Wauwinet, Miacomet, and Siasconset (generally shortened to \"'Sconset\").\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Nantucket features a climate that is \"Cfb\" (oceanic), a climate type rarely found on the east coast of North America. Nantucket's climate is heavily influenced by the Atlantic Ocean, which helps moderate temperatures in the town throughout the course of the year. Average high temperatures during the town's coldest month (January) are around , while average high temperatures during the town's warmest months (July and August) hover around . Nantucket receives on average of precipitation annually, spread relatively evenly throughout the year. Similar to many other cities with an oceanic climate, Nantucket features a large number of cloudy or overcast days, particularly outside the summer months. The highest daily maximum temperature was on August 2, 1975, and the highest daily minimum temperature was on the same day. The lowest daily maximum temperature was on January 8, 1968, and the lowest daily minimum temperature was on December 31, 1962, January 16, 2004, and February 4, 2023. The hardiness zone is 7b.\nIn 2021, a 270-page coastal resilience plan was drafted to deal with issues related to climate change: groundwater table rise, coastal flooding, high tide flooding, and coastal erosion. The plan identified forty proposed projects over the next fifteen years at a cost of $930 million. The coastal resilience advisory coordinator anticipated damages through 2070 of $3.4 billion if nothing is done to fight sea level rise.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"US Census population/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of the 2020 United States census, there were 14,255\u00a0people, up from 10,172\u00a0in 2010, residing in the county.\nRace and origins.\nThe 2020 data for racial makeup of the county was 71.3% white, 7.2% black or African American, 1.9% Asian, 0.6% American Indian, 9.3% from other races, and 9.7% from two or more races. Those of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 16.2% of the population. The median age of the population was 39.9 years; 22.2% were aged under 21 years, while 15.9% were aged over 65 years.\nAccording to the 2020 census data for Nantucket County, the largest groups by origins (alone or in any combination) were Irish Americans (2,612), English (2,492), German (1,229), Italian (901), Jamaican (635), Scottish (632), French (476), Polish (389), Portuguese (285), African Americans (251), Swedish (247) and Bulgarian (201). By Hispanic origins of any race, Salvadoran (1,143), Dominican (501), Mexican (124), Guatemalan (63), Spanish (46), Puerto Rican (41), Spaniard (34) and Colombian (32).\nHousing.\nThere were 12,619 housing units on the island; 5,478 were occupied with most of the rest being for seasonal, recreational or occasional use. 59.7% of the occupied housing units were owner-occupied, 40.3% were renter-occupied. Of the 5,478 households, 52.1% contained married or cohabiting couples. In 19.7% of households a couple were living with their children aged under 18, while a further 6% of households contained a householder living alone with their children under 18.\nIn 2017\u20132021 the median income for a household in the county was $116,571 and the per capita income was $52,324. 5.9% of the population were living below the poverty line.\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median value of homes in Nantucket County was $1,370,522, an increase of 22.3% from the prior year, and ranked the highest in the US by median home value.\nGovernment.\nNantucket is the only such consolidated town-county in Massachusetts. As of the 2020 census, the population was 14,255, making it the least populated county in Massachusetts. Part of the town is designated the Nantucket CDP, or census-designated place. The region of Surfside on Nantucket is the southernmost settlement in Massachusetts.\nLocal.\nTown and county governments are combined in Nantucket (see List of counties in Massachusetts). Nantucket's elected executive body is its Select Board (name changed in 2018 from Board of Selectmen), which is responsible for the town government's goals and policies. Legislative functions are carried out by an open Town Meeting of the Town's registered voters. It is administered by a town manager, who is responsible for all departments, except for the school, airport and water departments.\nState.\nNantucket is represented in the Massachusetts House of Representatives by Dylan Fernandes, Democrat, of Woods Hole, who represents Precincts 1, 2, 5 and 6, of Falmouth, in Barnstable County; Chilmark, Edgartown, Aquinnah, Gosnold, Oak Bluffs, Tisbury and West Tisbury, all in Dukes County; and Nantucket. Rep. Fernandes has served since January 4, 2017. Nantucket is represented in the Massachusetts Senate by Julian Cyr, Democrat, of Truro, who has also served since January 4, 2017.\nNational.\nNantucket is in Massachusetts's 9th congressional district, which has existed since 2013. As of 2013[ [update]], it was represented in the United States House of Representatives by Bill Keating, a Democrat of Bourne. Massachusetts is currently represented in the United States Senate by senior senator Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) and junior senator Ed Markey (Democrat).\nPolitics.\nParty affiliations.\nIn 2024, 63% of Nantucket residents were unaligned with a major political party, 25% were registered Democrats, and 10% were registered Republicans.\nVoting patterns.\nThroughout the late 19th and most of the 20th century, Nantucket was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections. From 1876 to 1984, only two Democrats carried Nantucket: Woodrow Wilson and Lyndon Johnson. Since 1988, however, it has trended Democratic.\nEconomy.\nTop employers.\nAccording to Nantucket's 2018 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the town are:\nEducation.\nNantucket's public school district is Nantucket Public Schools. The Nantucket school system had 1,583 students and 137 teachers in 2017.\nPublic schools on the island include:\nPrivate schools on the island include:\nNantucket Public Schools District information and meetings are broadcast on Nantucket Community Television (Channel 18) in Nantucket.\nA major museum association, the Maria Mitchell Association, offers educational programs to the Nantucket Public Schools, as well as the Nantucket Historical Association, though the two are not affiliated.\nThe University of Massachusetts Boston operates a field station on Nantucket. The Massachusetts College of Art &amp; Design is affiliated with the Nantucket Island School of Design &amp; the Arts, which offers summer courses for teens, youth, postgraduate, and undergraduate programs.\nArts and culture.\nNantucket has several noted museums and galleries, including the Maria Mitchell Association and the Nantucket Whaling Museum.\nNantucket is home to both visual and performing arts. The island has been an art colony since the 1920s, whose artists have come to capture the natural beauty of the island's landscapes and seascapes, including its flora and the fauna. Noted artists who have lived on or painted in Nantucket include Frank Swift Chase and Theodore Robinson. Illustrator and puppeteer Tony Sarg moved to the island in 1922, and in 1937 created an inflatable creature which sailed across the harbour as part of the \"sea monster\" hoax. Artist Rodney Charman was commissioned to create a series of paintings depicting the marine history of Nantucket, which were collected in the book \"Portrait of Nantucket, 1659\u20131890: The Paintings of Rodney Charman\" in 1989.\nThe island is the site of a number of festivals, including a book festival, wine and food festival, comedy festival, daffodil festival, and a cranberry festival.\nPopular culture.\nSeveral historical, literary and dramatic works involve people from, or living on, Nantucket. These include:\nTransportation.\nWater.\nFerry service is provided year-round by the Steamship Authority and Hy-Line Cruises. Seasonal ferry services include ferries from New Bedford, Harwich, and Oak Bluffs on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Private boats can also access the island via Nantucket Harbor.\nAir.\nThe island is served by Nantucket Memorial Airport (IATA: ACK), located on the south side of the island. During the summer months, the airport becomes one of the busiest in Massachusetts, handling a high volume of private aircraft and seasonal commercial flights. Carriers such as Cape Air operate frequent regional flights, primarily using small aircraft such as the Cessna 402 and Tecnam P2012 Traveler. JetBlue and American Airlines Delta Connection And United Express also offer seasonal jet service to major hubs including Boston, New York, and Washington, D.C. Chicago O\u2019Hare and Newark NJ\nBus.\nThe Nantucket Regional Transit Authority operates year-round bus service on the island.\nBike.\nThe island also supports an extensive network of bike paths, and bicycling is a popular way to explore Nantucket.\nCar.\nTaxis, rental cars, and ride-sharing services are available, though limited in number.\nHistoric.\nFrom 1900 to 1918, Nantucket was one of few jurisdictions in the United States that banned automobiles.\nA narrow-gauge railway, the Nantucket Railroad, operated from 1881 to 1917, connecting Nantucket town to Surfside and later to Siasconset. It served both passengers and freight but was eventually shut down due to financial difficulties and the rise of alternative transportation.\nDuring the early 20th century, steamboats were the primary means of reaching the island. These vessels connected Nantucket to the mainland before the rise of modern ferry systems and air travel.\nTransportation disasters.\nNantucket waters were the site of several noted transportation disasters:\nNational Register of Historic Places.\nThe following Nantucket places are listed on the National Register of Historic Places:\nNotable people.\nWhile many notable people own property or regularly visit the island, the following have been residents of the island:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62262", "revid": "44008019", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62262", "title": "Lewis Milestone", "text": "Russian-American filmmaker (1895\u20131980)\nLewis Milestone (born Leib Milstein; ; September 30, 1895 \u2013 September 25, 1980) was a Russian-American filmmaker. Milestone directed \"Two Arabian Knights\" (1927) and \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930), both of which received the Academy Award for Best Director. He also directed \"The Front Page\" (1931), \"The General Died at Dawn\" (1936), \"Of Mice and Men\" (1939), \"Ocean's 11\" (1960), and received the directing credit for \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962), though Marlon Brando largely appropriated his responsibilities during its production.\nEarly life.\nLev or Leib Milstein was born in Kishinev, capital of Bessarabia, Russian Empire (now Chi\u0219in\u0103u, Moldova), into a wealthy, distinguished family of Jewish heritage. Milstein received his primary education at Jewish schools, reflecting his parents' liberal social and political orientation, and including a study of several languages. Milstein's family discouraged his early love of theater and his desire to follow the dramatic arts, and dispatched him to Mittweida, Saxony, to study engineering.\nAfter neglecting his classes to attend local theater productions, Milstein failed his coursework. He was intent on pursuing a theatrical career and bought a one-way ticket to the United States. Milstein arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey, on November 14, 1913, shortly after his eighteenth birthday.\nMilstein, who found difficulty supporting himself in New York City, worked as a janitor, door-to-door salesman and lace-machine operator before finding a position as portrait-and-theater photographer in 1915. In 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, he enlisted in the Army Signal Corps. Milstein was stationed in New York City and Washington, D.C., and was assigned to the corps' photography unit, where he trained in aerial photography, assisted on training films and edited documentary combat footage. His cohorts in the Signal Corps included future Hollywood directors Josef von Sternberg and Victor Fleming. In February 1919, Milstein was discharged from the army, immediately obtained US citizenship, and legally changed his surname to Milestone. An acquaintance from the Signal Corps Jesse D. Hampton, now an independent film producer, secured Milestone an entry-level position as an assistant editor in Hollywood.\nHollywood apprenticeship 1919\u20131924.\nWhen Milestone arrived in Hollywood, he was still in financial difficulties. He later said to sustain himself until his studio job commenced, he briefly worked as a card dealer at a Los Angeles City Oil Field gambling venue.\nMilestone accepted mundane assignments from Hampton at $20 per week, and progressed from assistant editor toward director. In 1920 he was chosen as general assistant to director Henry King at Path\u00e9 Exchange. Milestone's first credited work was as assistant on King's film \"Dice of Destiny\" (1920).\nDuring the next six years, Milestone \"took on jobs in any capacity available\" in the Hollywood film industry, working as editor for director-producer Thomas Ince, as general assistant and co-author on film scripts by William A. Seiter and as a gag writer for comedian Harold Lloyd. In 1923, Milestone followed Seiter to Warner Brothers studios as assistant director on \"Little Church Around the Corner\" (1923), completing most of the film-making tasks on the production. Milestone's reputation as an effective \"film doctor\" who was skilled at salvaging movies led Warner to began offering Milestone's services to other studios at inflated rates.\nDirector: Silent era, 1925\u20131929.\nBy 1925, Milestone was writing screen treatments for films at Universal and Warner studios, among them \"The Mad Whirl\", \"Dangerous Innocence\", \"The Teaser\" and \"Bobbed Hair\". The same year, Milestone approached Jack L. Warner with a proposal: Milestone would provide the producer with a story free of charge if he was allowed to direct it. Warner agreed to sponsor Milestone's directorial debut \"Seven Sinners\" (1925).\n\"Seven Sinners\" is one of three films Milestone directed with Marie Prevost, Mack Sennett and a former female comedian. Jack Warner appointed Darryl F. Zanuck as screenwriter. The film is a \"semi-sophisticated\" comedy incorporating elements of slapstick, and was sufficiently successful with critics and the public to allow Milestone, now 29 years old, additional directing assignments.\nMilestone's second Prevost comedy was \"The Caveman\" (1926), which quickly earned him praise for its \"adroit direction\". During production, Milestone broke his contract with the studio over his exploitation as a \"film doctor\": Warners sued for damages and won, forcing Milestone to file for bankruptcy. \"The Caveman\" was his last film for Warner Bros. until \"Edge of Darkness\" (1943). Undeterred, Paramount Pictures quickly acquired Milestone.\n\"The New Klondike\" (1926), a sports-themed drama based on a Ring Lardner story, was filmed on location in Florida. Despite a \"lukewarm\" response from critics, Paramount was enthusiastic regarding Milestone's prospects, showcasing him with other young studio talent in the promotional film \"Fascinating Youth\" (1926). An argument with screen star Gloria Swanson on the set of \"Fine Manners\" (1926) led Milestone to walk off the project, leaving director Richard Rosson to complete it.\n\"Two Arabian Knights\" (1927), which is considered Milestones most outstanding work during the silent era, was inspired by the Anderson\u2013Stallings stage play \"What Price Glory?\" (1924), and director Raoul Walsh's 1924 screen adaptation of it. It was the first film in a four-year contract with Howard Hughes' The Caddo Company and is Milestone's only film of 1927. The film garnered Milestone an Academy Award for best comedy direction in 1927, prevailing over Charlie Chaplin's \"The Circus\" (1928). During World War I, doughboys William Boyd and Louis Wolheim, and love-object Mary Astor form a comic triangle.\n\"The Garden of Eden\" (1928) was made under a Caddo releasing agreement with Universal Pictures. The film is \"a variation on the Cinderella story... of acidic sophistication\", and was adapted by screenwriter Hans Kraly; it resembles, in both script and visual production, the works of Ernst Lubitsch. The project benefited from the lavish sets William Cameron Menzies designed and the cinematography of John Arnold. The film stars Corinne Griffith. Milestone's cinematic rendering of \"Two Arabian Knights\" and \"The Garden of Eden\" established him as a skilled practitioner of \"rough and sophisticated\" comedy.\nMilestone was wary of being stereotyped as a comedy director, and he shifted to an emerging genre director Josef von Sternberg popularized with his gangland fantasy \"Underworld\" (1927). \"The Racket\", a \"taut and realistic\" depiction of a mobster-controlled police department, distinguished Milestone as a capable director of the genre but its reception was lessened by a flood of inferior gangster films in the late 1920s. \"The Racket\" was nominated for Best Picture at the 1928 Academy Awards.\nEarly sound era: 1929\u20131936.\n\"New York Nights\" (1929).\nMilestone's first sound production \"New York Nights\" proved inauspicious. The film was a vehicle for silent screen icon Norma Talmadge\u2014whose spouse was producer Joseph Schenck. Milestone attempted to accommodate United Artists' desire to blend the \"show-biz\" and gangster genres in an adaptation of \"the justly forgotten\" Broadway production \"Tin Pan Alley\". According to Chanham, \"New York Nights\" \"gave little indication of Milestone's ability in adapting to sound techniques\". According to film historian Joseph Millichap:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In several ways \"New York Nights\" is best considered with Milestone's silent efforts, as it seems an obviously unimportant transitional piece. Like many early sound films it is shot from a few camera settings, and it is full of static scenes in which the cast is all too obviously speaking into hidden microphones. Milestone was so displeased with the final cut that he asked to have his name removed from the credits\u00a0... the film is not worth considering as Milestone's first sound work.\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930).\nMilestone's anti-war picture\" All Quiet on the Western Front\" is widely recognized as his directorial masterpiece, and as one of the most-compelling dramatizations of soldiers in combat during the Great War. The film was adapted from Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 eponymous novel. Milestone cinematically conveyed the \"grim realism and anti-war themes\" that characterize the novel. Universal Studio's head of production Carl Laemmle Jr., purchased the film rights to capitalize on the international success of Remarque's book. According to Strago (2017):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When he was preparing to shoot his wrenching anti-war film \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" from the point of view of German schoolboys who become soldiers, Universal co-founder and president Carl Laemmle pleaded with him for a \"happy ending.\" Milestone replied, \"I've got your happy ending. We'll let the Germans win the war.\"\n\"All Quiet on the Western Front\" presents the war from the perspective of a unit of patriotic, young, German soldiers who become disillusioned with the horrors of trench warfare. Actor Lew Ayres portrays the na\u00efve, sensitive youth Paul Baumer. According to Thompson (2015), Milestone\u2014who was uncredited\u2014together with screenwriters Maxwell Anderson, Del Andrews and George Abbott, wrote a script that \"reproduces the terse, tough dialogue\" of Remarque's novel to \"expose war for what it is, and not glorify it\". Originally conceived as a silent film, Milestone filmed both a silent and a talkie version, shooting them together in sequence.\nThe most significant technical innovation of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" is Milestone's integration of the era's rudimentary sound technology with the advanced visual effects developed during the late silent era. Applying post-synchronization of the sound recordings, Milestone was at liberty to \"shoot the way we've always shot... it was that simple. All the tracking shots were done with a silent camera\". In one of the film's most-disturbing sequences, Milestone used tracking shots and sound effects to graphically show the effects of artillery and machine guns on advancing troops.\nThe movie met with critical and popular approval, it won Academy Award for Best Picture and earned Milestone Academy Award for Best Director. \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" established Milestone as a talent in the film industry; Howard Hughes rewarded him with an adaptation of Ben Hecht's and Charles MacArthur's 1928 play \"The Front Page\".\n\"The Front Page\" (1931).\n\"The Front Page\" (1931), in which Milestone depicted backroom denizens of Chicago newspaper tabloids, is considered one of the most influential films of 1931 and introduced the Hollywood archetype of the experienced, fast-talking reporter. The film's script retains the \"sparkling dialogue [and] hard, fast and ruthless pace\" of Ben Hecht's and Charles MacArthur's 1928 stage production. \"The Front Page\" began the 1930s journalism genre, which other studios imitated, and a number of remakes\u2014including Howard Hawks' \"His Girl Friday\" (1940) and Billy Wilder's \"The Front Page\" (1974)\u2014appeared.\nMilestone was disappointed with the casting of Pat O'Brien as reporter \"Hildy\" Johnson; he wanted to cast James Cagney or Clark Gable in the role but producer Howard Hughes vetoed this choice in favor of O'Brien, who had performed in the Chicago stage production of \"The Front Page\".\nAccording to Biographer Charles Higham (1973), \"\"The Front Page\" surpasses \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" in being wholly a masterpiece, and one of the greatest pictures of the period. Milestone achieved a perfect marriage of film and theater. The picture has a vividness not matched in a newspaper subject until Citizen Kane\"\nAccording to Joseph Millichap:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMilestone's technique is demonstrated in the opening tracking shots of the newspaper's printing plant, and the confrontation between Molly Malloy (Mae Clarke) and a throng of reporters. \"The Front Page\" received a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards and a \"Film Daily\" poll of 300 movie critics listed Milestone among \"The Ten Best Directors\".\n1932\u20131936.\nMilestone was troubled by film directors' declining control within the studio system and supported King Vidor's proposal to organize a filmmakers' cooperative. Supporters for a Screen Directors Guild included Frank Borzage, Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian and William Wellman, among others. By 1938, the guild was incorporated, representing 600 directors and assistant directors.\nIn the mid-1930s, Paramount Pictures was experiencing a financial crisis that inhibited their commitments to their European film stylists such as Josef von Sternberg, Ernst Lubitsch and Milestone. Under these conditions, Milestone experienced difficulty in locating compelling literary material, production support and proper casting. The first among these films is \"Rain\" (1932).\nAllied Artists assigned Milestone rising star Joan Crawford, who was known for her silent film roles as a flapper, to play prostitute Sadie Thompson. Crawford expressed disappointment with her interpretation of the role. Milestone was not yet affected by the Production Code, and his portrayal of the overwrought Puritan missionary Reverend Davidson (Walter Huston); his rape of Thompson blends violence with sexual and religious symbolism using swift cutting.\nThe film was termed \"slow and stage-bound\" and \"stiff and stagey\". Milestone said of \"Rain\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I thought [audiences] were ready for a dramatic form; that now we could present a three-act play on the screen. But I was wrong. People will not listen to narrative dialogue. They will not accept the kind of exposition you use on the stage. I started the picture slowly, too slowly, I'm afraid. You can't start a picture slowly. You must show things happening.\n\"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\" (1933), which was released during the Great Depression, was an attempt by United Artists to reintroduce singer Al Jolson after his three-year hiatus from film roles. The film is based on a Ben Hecht story, with a score by Rodgers and Hart featuring \"rhythmic dialogue\" delivered in song-song; its sentimental, romantic theme of a New York City tramp was received with indifference and dismay by moviegoers. Film historian Joseph Millichap observed that \"the problem of this entertainment fantasy was that it brushed aside just enough reality to confuse its audience. Americans in the winter of 1933 were not in the mood to be advised that the life of a hobo was the road to true happiness, especially by a star earning $25,000 a week.\" Milestone's effort to make a \"socially conscious\" musical was generally ill-received at its New York opening and he had difficulty finding a more serious film project.\nMilestone attempted to make a film about the Russian Revolution (working title: \"Red Square\") based on Stalinist Ilya Ehrenburg's work \"The Life and Death of Nikolai Kourbov\" (1923), and an adaptation of H. G. Wells's \"The Shape of Things to Come\" (1933) proposed by Alexander Korda, but neither project materialized. In lieu of these unrealized films, Milestone directed \"a string of three insignificant studio pieces\" from 1934 to 1936.\nMilestone accepted a lucrative deal to direct a film starring John Gilbert and left United Artists for Harry Cohn's Columbia Pictures. \"The Captain Hates the Sea\" (1934) is a spoof of the 1932 movie \"Grand Hotel\", which stars Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford and John Barrymore. Milestone's largely improvised film stars an ensemble of Columbia's character actors, among them Victor McLaglen and The Three Stooges. Joseph Millichap described \"The Captain Hates the Sea\" as \"a very uneven, disconnected, rambling piece\". Cost overruns on \"The Captain Hates the Sea\", which were complicated by heavy drinking by the cast members\u2014soured relations between Milestone and Cohen. The movie is notable as the final film of Gilbert's career.\nMilestone's next two films for Paramount \"Paris in Spring\" (1935) and \"Anything Goes\" (1936), are his only musicals of his career, but are relatively undistinguished in their execution. Milestone described them as \"insignificant\". Milestone was assigned \"Paris in Spring\", a romantic musical farce. Leading man Tullio Carminati had just completed the operetta-like \"One Night of Love\" (1934) with Grace Moore at Columbia Studios. Paramount paired Mary Ellis with Carminati, and it was Milestone's task to direct a film to rival Columbia's success. Aside from a credible replica of Paris created by art directors Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegt\u00e9, Milestone's directing failed to overcome \"the essential flatness of the tale\". \"Anything Goes\", a musical starring Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman, and adapted from Cole Porter's 1934 Broadway musical, includes some enduring songs, including \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"You're the Top\", and the title song. According to Canham, Milestone's directing is conscientious but he showed little enthusiasm for the genre.\n\"The General Died at Dawn\" (1936).\nFollowing his two lackluster musicals, Milestone returned to form in 1936 with \"The General Died at Dawn\", which is reminiscent in theme, setting and style of director Josef von Sternberg's \"The Shanghai Express\" (1932).\nThe screenplay was written by Leftist playwright Clifford Odets and is derived from an obscure pulp-influenced manuscript by Charles G. Booth. It is set in the Far East, and has a sociopolitical theme: the \"tension between democracy and authoritarianism\". In the opening few minutes, Milestone establishes the American mercenary O'Hara (Gary Cooper), who has republican commitments. His adversary is the complex, Chinese warlord General Yang (Akim Tamiroff). Madeleine Carroll is cast as the young missionary Judy Perrie, who is \"trapped between divided social forces\" and struggles to overcome her diffidence, and ultimately joins O\"Hara in supporting a peasant revolt against Yang.\nMilestone's brings to the adventure-melodrama a \"bravura\" exposition of his cinematic style and technical skills; an impressive use of tracking, a five-way split screen and a widely noted use of a match dissolve that transitions from a billiard table to a white door handle leading to an adjoining room; it is \"one of the most expert match shots on record\" according to historian John Baxter.\nThough disparaged by Milestone in retrospect, \"The General Died at Dawn\" is considered one of the \"masterpieces\" of 1930s Hollywood cinema. Milestone was served by cinematographer Victor Milner, art directors Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegt\u00e9, and composer Werner Janssen in, according to Baxter (1970), creating \"his most exquisite and exciting if not most meaningful examination of social friction in a human context\".\nDirectorial hiatus: 1936\u20131939.\nAfter completing \"The General Died at Dawn\", Milestone experienced a series of professional setbacks, including lawsuits, failed projects and broken contracts, that stalled his film career for three years.\nDuring this period, Milestone pursued a number of serious projects, including direction of a film version of Vincent Sheean's memoir \"Personal History\" (1935), which Alfred Hitchcock later directed as \"Foreign Correspondent\" (1940), went unfulfilled. Another failed project was a screenplay Milestone and Clifford Odets wrote for an adaptation of the Sidney Kingsley Broadway hit \"Dead End\" (1935) for Sam Goldwyn that went to William Wyler, a director of literary texts, like Milestone.\nTo remain employed, Milestone accepted Paramount's offer to direct Pat O'Brien in show-business drama \"The Night of Nights\" (1939), a \"second-line\" studio production. According to Millichap (1981), the film's best feature is its sets, which Hans Dreier designed.\nAfter signing a contract with Hal Roach in late 1937 to direct an adaptation of Eric S. Hatch's novel \"Road Show\" (1934), the producer dismissed Milestone for straying from the novel's comedic elements. Litigation ensued, and the matter was resolved when Roach presented Milestone with another project: to adapt to film John Steinbeck's novella \"Of Mice and Men\" (1937).\n\"Of Mice and Men\" (1939).\nMilestone had been impressed with Steinbeck's novella \"Of Mice and Men\" and its 1938 stage production, a morality play set during the Dust Bowl, and he was enthusiastic about the film project. Producer Hal Roach hoped to emulate the anticipated success of director John Ford's adaptation of another Steinbeck work The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Both films drew upon the political and creative developments that emerged in the Great Depression rather than the approaching 1940s and the impending conflict in Europe. Milestone solicited Steinbeck's support for the film; Steinbeck \"essentially approved the script\", as did the Hays Office, which made only \"minor\" changes to the scenario.\nAccording to Millichap (1981), Milestone maintains the \"anti-omniscient\" detachment Steinbeck applied to his novella with a cinematic viewpoint that matches the author's literary realism. Milestone placed great emphasis on visual and sound motifs that develop the characters and themes. As such, he carefully conferred on image motifs with art director Nicolai Remisoff and cameraman Norbert Brodine, and persuaded composer Aaron Copland to provide the musical score. Critic Kingley Canham noted the importance Milestone placed on his sound motifs:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt; the [musical] score, one of several scored for Milestone by Aaron Copland, played a decisive role in the form of the film: natural sounds and dialogue sequences were interpolated with the music to act as complementary \"motifs\" to the visual and narrative development.\nThe film was a critical success and garnered Copland Academy Award nominations for Best Musical Score and Best Original Score.\nMilestone, who preferred to cast \"relative unknowns\"\u2014in this case influenced by budgetary restraints\u2014cast Lon Chaney Jr. to play the childlike Lennie Small and Burgess Meredith as his keeper George Milton. Betty Field, in her first important feature, plays Mae, the faithless spouse of straw boss Curly (Bob Steele).\n\"Of Mice and Men\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1939 but competing with the year's other major films, including \"The Wizard of Oz\" (Victor Fleming), \"Stagecoach\" (John Ford), \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips\" (Sam Wood), \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\" (Frank Capra), \"Wuthering Heights\" (William Wyler), and the winner, \"Gone with the Wind\" (Victor Fleming).\nDespite critical accolades for \"Of Mice and Men\", the tragic narrative that ends in the mercy-killing of the doomed Lennie at the hands of his comrade George was less than gratifying to audiences, and it failed at the box office.\nEarly 1940s.\nMilestone's reputation as a director was undiminished among Hollywood executives after \"Of Mice and Men\", and RKO signed him to direct two light comedies, both of which star Ronald Colman. Milestone was provided with his own production unit, and quickly satisfied his contractual obligations, directing Ginger Rogers in \"Lucky Partners\" (1940) and Anna Lee in the \"totally disarming frolic\" \"My Life with Caroline\" (1941). According to Milestone:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This particular pair of comedies [\"Lucky Partner\" (1940) and \"My Life with Caroline\" (1941)] were of the kind you did if you hoped to stay in motion pictures, in the expectation that the next film might give you a chance to redeem yourself.\nWorld War II Hollywood propaganda: 1942\u20131945.\nMilestone's reputation as the director of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930), though an emphatically pacifist and anti-war film, positioned him as an asset in Hollywood's \"patriotic and profitable\" production of anti-fascist war films. Film curator Charles Silver noted Milestone's \"facility for capturing battle's intrinsic spectacle... there is an inevitable pageantry to cinematic warfare that works against whatever pacifist intentions the filmmaker may have\". Milestone said, \"how can you make a pacifist film without showing the violence of war?\" Responding to the \"general climate of opinion in wartime Hollywood\", Milestone abandoned any reservations about his commitments to the US war effort and offered his services to the film industry's propaganda units.\n\"Our Russian Front\" (1942).\n\"Our Russian Front\" is a 1942 war documentary assembled from of newsreel footage taken on the Russian front by Soviet citizen-journalists during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. In collaboration with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, working with The Government Film Service in 1940, Milestone depicted the struggle of Russian villagers to resist the German invasion. Actor Walter Huston narrated the documentary and composer Dimitri Tiomkin provided the film score.\n\"Edge of Darkness\" (1943).\nSeventeen years after directing \"The Caveman\" (1926) for Warner Brothers, Milestone returned to Warner in a one-film contract. \"Edge of Darkness\" is the first of three successful films he made in collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen. The film stars Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan as Norwegian freedom fighters, and Helmut Dantine as a sociopathic Nazi commandant; it signals a change in Milestone's professional and personal attitude toward his war films. Milestone said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Edge of Darkness\" has done away with disillusionment. We know the enemy we are fighting and we are facing the stern realities of the present war. The moral of \"Edge of Darkness\" is \"United we stand, divided we fall.\" That is the great lesson of our time and the keystone for victory for the democratic cause.\n\"Edge of Darkness\", a melodramatic film fantasy, is set in a remote Norwegian village whose inhabitants are brutalized by Nazi occupiers, inspiring resistance among the townspeople, who rebel and eliminate the Nazi occupiers. Milestone employs an \"anti-suspense\" device that shows the carnage suffered by the inhabitants then reveals the story in flashback. Milestone's \"thematic oversimplification\" reflected Hollywood's penchant for melodramatic propaganda.\n\"The North Star\" (1943).\nMilestone's next project was the propaganda film \"The North Star\", which dramatizes the damage caused by the German invasion of the Soviet Union to the inhabitants of a Ukrainian farming collective. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt dispatched Lowell Mellett, chief of the Bureau of Motion Pictures of the Office of War Information to enlist producer Sam Goldwyn to make a film celebrating America's wartime alliance with Russia. Milestone's production staff included playwright-screenwriter Lillian Hellman, cinematographer James Wong Howe, set designer William Cameron Menzies, composer Aaron Copland, lyricist Ira Gershwin and a competent cast.\nHellman's script and Milestone's cinematic compositions establish the bucolic settings and social unity that characterize the collective's inhabitants. Milestone uses a tracking shot to follow the aged comic figure Karp (Walter Brennan) as he rides his cart through the village, a device Milestone used to introduce the film's key characters. An extended sequence portrays the villagers celebrating the harvest with food, song and dance, resembling an ethnic operetta. Milestone used an overhead camera to record the circular symmetry of the happy revelers. Milestone displays his \"technical mastery\" as villagers discern the approach of German bombers. Portions of this sequence resemble documentary war footage, recalling Milestone's work in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) and Joris Ivens \"The Spanish Earth\" (1937).\n\"The North Star\" received positive reviews from the mainstream press, and only Hearst-owned papers interpreted the film's pro-Russian themes as pro-Communist propaganda. The Academy of Arts and Sciences nominated \"The North Star\" for Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, Best Musical Score, Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay. The film was largely ignored at the box office.\nIn the post-war years, Sam Goldwyn's \"The North Star\", Warner Brothers' \"Mission to Moscow\" (1943) and M-G-M's \"Song of Russia\" (1944) came under scrutiny by the anti-communist House Un-American Activities Committee.\nIn 1957, \"The North Star\" was reissued as \"Armored Attack\" in a heavily edited form; sequences that celebrate life under the Stalinist regime were removed. The setting is represented as Hungary during its 1956 uprising with a voice-over condemning communism.\n\"The Purple Heart\" (1944).\n\"The Purple Heart\" (1944), which is set in the Pacific War, is about captured American airmen who are prosecuted by Imperial Japan with violating the Geneva Conventions by participating in the July 18, 1942, Doolittle Raid over Japan by B-25 bombers.\nThe film is based on a real-life incident. Milestone's technical skill in presenting the airmen's ordeal was potent propaganda but it risked rationalizing the US bombing and anti-Japanese jingoism. The Purple Heart award which the captured men are ultimately bestowed is earned through wounds inflicted by torture to extract military secrets and not through combat. According to Millichap (1981), it is a cinematically superior war film; Milestone said of his commitment to supply propaganda for the American war effort: \"We didn't hesitate to make this kind of film during the war\".\n\"Guest in the House\" (1944).\nMilestone's next project, the United Artists production \"Guest in the House\", is a psychological thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock. Milestone was removed from the project when he underwent an emergency appendectomy during filming. Milestone contributed some scenes but John Brahm was credited with directing the film, which prepared Anne Baxter for her starring role in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1950 feature \"All About Eve\".\n\"A Walk in the Sun\" (1945).\nMilestone's second collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen \"A Walk in the Sun\" (1945) is based on Harry Joe Brown's 1944 eponymous novel. Milestone invested $30,000 of his own savings, a measure of his enthusiasm for the novel and its cinematic potential. \"A Walk in the Sun\" takes place during the 1943 Allied invasion of Italy; a platoon of American soldiers are tasked with advancing inland from Salerno to take a German-held bridge and farmhouse. Milestone's perspective on war as depicted in \"A Walk in the Sun\" differs with that of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", a moving indictment of war. According to biographer Joseph Millichap:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"All Quiet on the Western Front\", both the novel and the film, used the microcosm of one platoon to make a major thematic statement about the macrocosm of war. \"A Walk in the Sun\"'s thematic statement is muted by the demands of propaganda and the studio system in the film.\nAccording to Millichap (1981), despite these limitations, Milestone avoided the \"set hero and mock heroics\" typical of Hollywood war movies, allowing for a measure of genuine realism reminiscent of his 1930 masterwork [\"All Quiet on the Western Front\"]. Milestone's trademark handling of tracking shots is evident in the action scenes.\nRed Scare and the Hollywood blacklist.\nAt the onset of the Cold War, Hollywood studios, in alliance with the US Congress, sought to expose communist-inspired content in American films. Milestone's pro-Soviet Union film \"The North Star\" (1943), which was made at the behest of the US government to encourage American support for its wartime alliance with the USSR against the Axis powers, became a target. Other pro-Soviet Union wartime films, such as Michael Curtiz's \"Mission to Moscow\" (1943), Gregory Ratoff's \"Song of Russia\" (1944) and Jacques Tourneur's \"Days of Glory\" (1944), were \"to haunt their creators in the McCarthy era\" when any hint of sympathy for the Soviet Union was considered subversive to American ideals.\nMilestone's alignment with liberal causes such as the Committee for the First Amendment compounded suspicions he harbored pro-communist sentiments during the Red Scare. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) summoned Milestone and other filmmakers for questioning. According to Joseph Millichap:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Russian-born Milestone, always a liberal intellectual with Leftist inclinations, was a natural target for the witch hunters of the HUAC. As early as November of 1946, Milestone appeared before the committee as an 'unfriendly witness'; in other words, he claimed his constitutional right not to testify. In 1948, the anti-communist writer Myron Fagan implied that Milestone was a Red sympathizer, [a claim made explicit] by Hedda Hopper in her nationally syndicated Hollywood column. Unlike the Hollywood Ten and many others, Milestone was able to keep working.\nThe effect of the Hollywood blacklist on Milestone's creative output is unclear. Unlike many of his colleagues, he continued to find work but, according to film critic Michael Barson, the quantity and quality of his work may have been limited through industry \"greylisting\". Millichap said, \"Milestone refused to comment on this side of his life: evidently he found it very painful\".\nPost-war films: 1946\u20131951.\n\"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\" (1946).\nThe movies Milestone directed in the late 1940s represent \"the last distinctive period\" in his creative output. His first post-war project was the Hal B. Wallis production \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\" (1946), which is based on the story \"Love Lies Bleeding\" by John Patrick. The film, which was made In collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen, is, according to Higham and Greenberg (1968), a \"striking addition\" to the post-war Hollywood film genre \"film noir\", combining a grim, 19th-century romanticism with the cinematic methods of German Expressionism.\nRossen's and Milestone's script provided the cast, which features Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin and Kirk Douglas in his first screen appearance with a \"taut, harsh\" narrative that critiques post-war, urban America as corrupt and irredeemable. Cinematographer Victor Milner supplied the \"film noir\" effects and musical director Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa integrated sound motifs with Milestone's visual elements.\n\"Arch of Triumph\" (1948).\nFollowing \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\", Milestone left Paramount and moved to the independent Enterprise Productions. His first film for Enterprise was \"Arch of Triumph\", which is based on Erich Maria Remarque's 1945 eponymous novel.\n\"Arch of Triumph\" was highly anticipated by moviegoers, and by Enterprise Productions, which committed huge capital investments to the project. The novel is set in Paris in 1939; Remarque's autobiographical work examines the personal devastation of two displaced persons: surgeon Dr. Ravic (Charles Boyer), who is fleeing Nazis persecution, and the \"demimonde\" courtesan Joan Modau (Ingrid Bergman); the pair fall in love and suffer a tragic fate.\nRemarque's depictions of the Paris underworld, which describe a revenge murder and a mercy killing, was at odds with the strictures of the Production Code Administration. Milestone excised \"the bars, brothels and operating rooms\", and the sordid ending from the screenplay. Enterprise Productions executives, who wanted a film that would rival Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's recently re-released \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), had procured Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. The miscasting of screen stars Boyer and Bergman as Dr. Ravic and Joan Madou, respectively, impaired Milestone's development of these characters with respect to the literary source. Milestone said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One thing wrong was that it was supposed to be a realistic piece, but it had two major stars in the lead. If you have two major stars like that, then half your reality goes out the window.\nMilestone delivered a four-hour version of \"Arch of Triumph\" Enterprise Productions had approved. Executives reversed that decision shortly before its release, cutting the movie to the more usual two hours. Entire scenes and characters were removed, undermining the clarity and continuity of Milestone's work. Milestone's overall disaffection for the project is evident in his indifferent application of cinematic technique, contributing to the failure of his film adaptation. According to Millichap (1981):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMillichap added: \"Wherever the blame is placed, \"Arch of Triumph\" is a clear failure, a bad film made from a good book\".\n\"Arch of Triumph\" was a failure at the box office and Enterprise Productions took a significant loss. Milestone continued working with the studio, accepting an offer to produce and direct a Dana Andrews and Lilli Palmer comedy, \"No Minor Vices\" (1948).\n\"No Minor Vices\", a \"semi-sophisticated\" film that is reminiscent of Milestone's 1941 comedy \"My Life with Caroline\", added little to Milestone's oeuvre. After this film, Milestone departed Enterprise.\n\"The Red Pony\" (1949).\nMilestone's next project, in collaboration with novelist John Steinbeck at Republic Pictures, was to direct a film version of \"The Red Pony\" (1937), a short story cycle set in California's rural Salinas Valley in the early 20th century. Milestone and Steinbeck had considered adapting these coming-of-age stories about a boy and his pony since 1940. In 1946, they partnered with Republic Pictures, an amalgamation of \"Poverty Row\" studios known for low-budget westerns but now prepared to invest in a major production.\nSteinbeck served as sole screenwriter on \"The Red Pony\". His novella, composed of four short stories, is \"unified only by continuities of character, setting theme\". Identifying a market for the film was a key concern for Republic, which insisted on a movie aimed at young audiences. In the interests of crafting a sequential, coherent narrative, Steinbeck mostly limited the film adaptation to the stories \"The Gift\" and \"The Leader of the People\", omitting some of the novella's harsher episodes. Steinbeck willingly provided a more upbeat ending to the film, an accommodation that according to Millichap (1981), \"completely distorts... the thematic thrust of Steinbeck's story sequence\".\nCasting for \"The Red Pony\" presented for Milestone difficulties developing Steinbeck's characters and themes, which explore a child's \"initiation into the realities of adult life\". The aging ranch hand Billy Buck is portrayed by the youthful and virile Robert Mitchum, whose character effectively displaces the father Fred Tiflin (Shepperd Strudwick) as male mentor to the nine-year-old Tom Tiflin (Peter Miles). The boy's mother is played by Myrna Loy. According to Millichap, \"The major casting problem is the [young] protagonist. Perhaps no child star could capture the complexity of this role, as it is much easier for an adult to write about sensitive children than for a child to play one.\"\nAccording to Millichap (1981), Milestone's cinematic effort fails to do justice to the literary source but several of the visual and aural elements are impressive. The opening sequence resembles the prologue of his 1939 adaptation of Steinbeck's novel \"Of Mice and Men\", introducing the natural world that will dominate and inform the characters' lives.\n\"The Red Pony\" is Milestone's first technicolor film; according to Canham (1974), his \"graceful visual touch\" is enhanced by cameraman Tony Gaudio's painterly renderings of the rural landscape. According to Barson (2020), composer Aaron Copland's highly regarded film score perhaps surpasses Milestone's visual rendering of Steinbeck's story.\n\"The Red Pony\" provided Enterprise with a satisfactory \"prestige\" property, generating critical praise and respectable box office returns.\nMove to 20th Century Fox.\nMilestone moved to 20th Century Fox where he made three films: \"Halls of Montezuma\" (1951), \"Kangaroo\" (1952) and \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (1952).\n\"Halls of Montezuma\", which was released in January 1951, reflects the Cold War imperatives that informed Hollywood films during the Korean War. The story, which was written by Michael Blankfort with Milestone as uncredited co-screenwriter, concerns an attack by US Marines on a Japanese-held island during World War II, and focuses on the heroic suffering experienced by one patrol in its effort to locate a Japanese rocket-launching bunker. Milestone's dual themes celebrate both Marine combat heroics, juxtaposed with an examination of psychological damage to the soldiers who participate in the \"horrors\" of modern warfare, including the torture of enemy combatants. Milestone denied \"Halls of Montezuma\" addressed his \"personal beliefs\" on the nature of war; he agreed to direct the movie as a financial expedient.\n\"Halls of Montezuma\" recalls some elements of Milestone's 1930 anti-war classic \"All Quiet on the Western Front\". The film's cast, like the earlier film, was selected from relatively unknown actors, their \"complex and believable\" characterizations revealing the contrasts between hardened veterans and green recruits. The cinematic handling of battle scenes is also reminiscent of the 1930 movie, where Marines deploy from their landing crafts and advance on open terrain under enemy fire. Milestone reverts to the formulaic war movie with a standard \"Give 'em Hell\" climax, accompanied by the strains of the Marine Hymn. The film is commonly cited as representing the onset of a purported decline in his talents or his exploitation by the studios.\nAfter completing \"Halls of Montezuma\", 20th Century Fox, the studio sent Milestone to Australia to use funds limited to reinvestment in that country. Based on this consideration, Milestone filmed \"Kangaroo\" (1952), which film critic Bosley Crowther termed an \"antipodal Western\". According to film critic Joseph Millichap (1981), Milestone struggled with the studio was over \"the utterly ridiculous script, a collection of Western \"clich\u00e9s\" transposed from the American plains to the Australian outback\". Milestone attempted to evade the poor literary vehicle by concentrating on \"the landscape, flora and fauna\" of the Australian outback at the expense of dialogue. The Technicolor cinematography by Charles G. Clarke achieved a documentary-like quality, incorporating Milestone's hallmark panning and tracking methods. It has been argued that Milestone's changes to the script hurt the film.\nFor the last of his three pictures at 20th Century Fox, Milestone delivered \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\" (1952), a 104-minute version of Victor Hugo's eponymous romance novel (1862). Fox producers provided the project with their contracted actors including Michael Rennie, Debra Paget, Robert Newton and Sylvia Sidney, and lavish production support. According to Canham (1974), the script by Richard Murphy \"telescopes all the novel's famous set-pieces into this clich\u00e9-ridden\" abbreviated adaptation. In a 1968 interview with film historians Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg, Milestone said of his approach during the filming of \"Les Miserables,\" \"Oh, for Chrissake, it was just a job; I'll do it and get it over with\". According to Millichap (1981), \"that he did little with [Hugo's] literary classic... seems to indicate the waning of Milestone's creative energies\".\nLate career, 1952\u20131962.\nMilestone's final years as a filmmaker correspond to the decline of the Hollywood movie empire; his final eight films reflect these historic developments. By 1962, shortly before the release of his last Hollywood film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"Films and Filming\" (December 1962) wrote: \"In common with so many of the Old Guard directors, Lewis Milestone's reputation has somewhat tarnished over the last decade. His films no longer have that stamp of individuality which distinguished his early work.\"\nDuring the last stage of his career, Milestone's films are, according to Joseph Millichap (1981), \"less a reprise of the director's earlier achievements than several desperate efforts to keep working. Even more markedly than in his earlier career, Milestone moved frenetically between pictures which varied widely in setting, style and accomplishment.\"\nSojourn in Europe, 1953\u20131954.\nIn the early 1950s, Milestone traveled to England and Italy seeking work. He directed a biography of a diva, a World War II action drama and an international romance-melodrama.\n\"Melba\" (1953), which was filmed at Horizon Pictures, is a biopic of Australian coloratura soprano singer Dame Nellie Melba. The film was an effort by producer Sam Spiegel to capitalize on the popularity of contemporaneous film biographies of Enrico Caruso and Gilbert and Sullivan. Metropolitan Opera star Patrice Munsel made her screen debut playing Melba. Aside from Munsel's performance, Milestone was forced to work with a \"worthless script\" and an \"insipid cast\", and failed to deliver a compelling rendering of Melba's life. According to Kingsley Canham, \"Melba\" \"turned out to be a disastrous flop\" at the box office. Milestone remained in England during 1953 to film \"They Who Dare\", a wartime adventure, for Mayflower Productions\u2013British Lion Films, starring Dirk Bogarde. The film is a dramatization of an account of a British-and-Greek commando unit that was assigned to destroy a German airfield on Rhodes. The film is based on a script by Robert Westerby; Milestone delivered an action-packed climax in the final minutes of the film that recalls his early work in this genre but the film had a poor reception from critics and audiences. According to Canham (1974), Milestone's consecutive box-office failures \"was not a good omen for an established director, especially in the Fifties\".\nMilestones next movie \"The Widow (La Vedova)\" (1955) was filmed in Italy for Ventruini/Express in 1954, and adapted by Milestone from a novel by Susan York. The film is a \"soap opera-ish love triangle\", and stars Patricia Roc, Massimo Serato and Anna Maria Ferrero. According to Canham (1974), \"The triangle and its consequences are predictable, and Milestone's part in the proceedings seems simply to record the inevitable tragedy on film\".\n\"Pork Chop Hill\" (1959).\nAccording to Millichap (1981), \"Pork Chop Hill\" (1959), which was produced by Sy Bartlett for the Melville Company, represents the third work in \"an informal war trilogy\", along with \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) and \"A Walk in the Sun\" (1945). The film is based on a recounting a Korean War battle by combat veteran S. L. A. Marshall and a screenplay by James R. Webb. According to Millichap (1981), Milestone was provided with a realistic literary platform from which to develop his final cinematic treatment of men at war.\nThe film's plot involves a strategically pointless assault by a company of U.S. infantrymen to secure and defend a nondescript hill against a much larger Chinese battalion. According to Canham (1974), the plot involves \"The story of a battle for a strategic point of little military value, but of great moral value, during the last days of the Korean War\".\nMilestone, and actor and financial investor in the project Gregory Peck, who plays company commander Lieutenant Joe Clemons, argued over the presentation of the film's themes. Rather than emphasize the pointlessness of the military operation, Peck favored a more politicized message, equating the taking of \"Pork Chop Hill\" as an equivalent to the battles of Bunker Hill and Gettysburg. According to McGee (2003) the studio's final edit of the director's cut blunted Milestone message concerning the futility of war, perhaps his most anti-war statement since \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930). According to Millichap (1981):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was Peck's conception of the part which doomed Milestone's vision; Peck converted the role into a more or less standard superman of World War II vintage... and also cut much of Milestone's careful development of other characters, his artistic counterpointing of the opposing forces, and his bitterly ironic conclusion.\nMilestone distanced himself from the final cut of the film, saying, \"Pork Chop Hill became a film I am not proud of... [merely] one more war movie\". In addition to Peck, Milestone cast primarily unknown actors as the officers and the rank-and-file characters, among them Woody Strode, Harry Guardino, Robert Blake in his first adult role, George Peppard, Norman Fell, Abel Fernandez, Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, and Clarence Williams III.\n\"Ocean's 11\" (1960).\nMilestone accepted an offer from Warner Bros. to produce and direct comedy-heist film \"Ocean's 11\" (1960) for Dorchester Studios. The story by George Clayton Johnson concerns of group of ex-military comrades who orchestrate an elaborate burglary of Las Vegas's biggest casinos. The movie stars the Rat Pack led by Frank Sinatra, who like the director, had been a supporter of the Committee for the First Amendment during the Red Scare. Milestone's earlier success with comedy films and combat sagas may have influenced Warner's decision to choose Milestone for the film.\nThe film's screenplay, which Millichap (1981) called \"preposterous\", was written by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer. Millichap (1981) said Milestone delivered a film that equivocates between a pure satire of American acquisitiveness or its celebration. The film was a box-office success but critics have widely dismissed it as unworthy of Milestone's talents. According to film critic David Walsh:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[H]owever history had contrived to drop the somewhat improbable project in his lap, Milestone no doubt worked away conscientiously on \"Ocean's 11\". He probably had little choice in the matter. Even in the last days of the studio system, directors were more or less at the beck and call of the studio chiefs. The more talented, working within an institutional strait jacket, struggled to imbue their genre projects with personal and social meaning, with varying degrees of success.\n\"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962).\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer's remake of Frank Lloyd's 1935 film \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton was consistent with Hollywood's resort to blockbuster productions during the late Fifties. The studio risked over $20 million on the \"ill-starred\" 1962 \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and recovered less than half of it.\nIn February 1961, the 65-year-old Milestone took over directorial duties from Carol Reed, who became disillusioned with the project due to inadequate scripting, inclement weather on location in Tahiti and disputes with leading man Marlon Brando. Milestone was tasked with bringing good order and discipline to the production, and with curbing Brando. Rather than inheriting a largely completed film, Milestone discovered only a few scenes had been filmed.\nAccording to Miller (2010), the production history of the 1962 \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" is a record of personal and professional recriminations registered by Milestone and Brando rather than a coherent cinematic endeavor. To assert creative control over his character mutineer Fletcher Christian, Brando collaborated with screenwriters and off the set, independently of Milestone, leading Milestone to withdraw from some scenes and sequences, and effectively relinquish control to Brando. Millichap refers to the film as \"the Brando-Milestone\" \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", noting \"the story of this Hollywood disaster is long and complex, but the central figure in every sense is Marlon Brando, not Lewis Milestone\".\n\"Mutiny on the Bounty\" is the final completed film for which Milestone was credited but according to Canham (1974), it is not considered representative of Milestone's \"oeuvre\".\nTelevision and unrealized film projects: 1955\u20131965.\nAfter completing \"The Widow (La Vedova)\" (1955), Milestone returned to the United States in search of film projects. With the Hollywood studio system in decline, Milestone resorted to television to keep working. Five years elapsed before he completed another feature film. In 1956\u20131957, Milestone partnered with actor-producer Kirk Douglas, who had debuted in Milestone's \"The Strange Love of Martha Ivers\" (1946), to make a movie about a \"Citizen Kane\"-like tycoon but the project, which was titled \"King Kelly\", was abandoned after a year.\nIn 1957, Milestone directed episodes of television drama series, including \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (two episodes), \"Schlitz Playhouse\" (two episodes) and \"Suspicion\" (one episode). In 1958, Milestone directed actor Richard Boone, who debuted in Milestone's\"Kangaroo\" (1952), in two episodes of the television western \"Have Gun \u2013 Will Travel\". Milestone embarked upon the filming of Warner Bros.'s \"PT 109\" (1963), a biography of John F. Kennedy's experiences as a torpedo boat commander in the Pacific War. After several weeks of filming, Jack L. Warner removed Milestone from the project and replaced him with director Leslie H. Martinson, who received the screen credit.\nMilestone found television productions unappealing but returned to that medium after completing \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962), directing one episode of the series \"Arrest and Trial\" and one episode of \"The Richard Boone Show\", both in 1963. Milestone's final film work was for a multinational joint venture with American International Pictures' \"La Guea Seno- The Dirty Game\" (1965), for which he directed one episode before being replaced by Terence Young due to failing health.\nSeveral of Milestone's films\u2014\"Seven Sinners\", \"The Front Page\", \"The Racket\", and \"Two Arabian Knights\"\u2014were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016 and 2017.\nPersonal life and death.\nIn 1935, Milestone and actor Kendall Lee, whose full name was Kendall Lee Glaezner, were married. Lee and Milestone had met on the set of his 1932 film \"Rain\", in which Lee had played Mrs. MacPhail. They had no children and remained married until Lee's death in 1978. According to biographer Joseph Millichap; \"over the years the Milestones were the most gracious of Hollywood hosts, giving parties that attracted the cream of the film community\".\nMilestone experienced declining health in the 1960s and suffered a stroke in 1978, shortly after the death of Kendall Lee, his wife of 43 years.\nAfter further illnesses, Milestone died on September 25, 1980, at UCLA Medical Center, five days before his 85th birthday. Milestone's final request before he died was for Universal Studios to restore \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) to its original length. The Library of Congress' Motion Picture Division released a fully-restored version of the film in 1998. Milestone is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\nRecognition and accolades.\nLewis Milestone's \"oeuvre\" spans thirty-seven years (1925\u20131962) and consists of 38 feature films. As such, according to Millichap (1981), he was one of the major contributors to screen art and entertainment during the Hollywood Golden Age. Like most of his contemporary American filmmakers, Milestone's work includes the silent and sound eras, which is evident in his style, which blends the visual elements of Expressionism with the Realism that evolved with naturalistic sound. According to Sarris in \"American Cinema\" (1968) quoted in Walsh (2001), Milestone was \"a formalist of the Left\" who was \"hailed as the American [Sergei] Eisenstein after \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" (1930) and \"The Front Page\" (1931)\".\nAt the outset of talking pictures, the 29-year-old Milestone used his skill for an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque's anti-war novel \"All Quiet on the Western Front\", which is regarded as Milestone's \"magnum opus\" and the peak of his career; according to Baxter (1970), Milestone's subsequent work never achieved the same artistic or critical success. Biographer Kingsley Canham wrote: \"The problem of making a classic film early in a career is that it sets a standard of comparison for all future work that is in some instances unfair\". Milestone's films occasionally exhibit the technical inventiveness and bravura of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" but lack Milestone's commitments to a literary source or screenplay that informed that film.\nAccording to Millichap (1981), Milestone's subsequent work in Hollywood includes outstanding and mediocre films that are characterized by their eclecticism but often lack any clear artistic purpose. The most predictable feature may have been an application of his technical talents. Film critic Andrew Sarris said: \"Milestone's fluid camera style has always been dissociated from any personal viewpoint. He is almost the classic example of the uncommitted director... his professionalism is as unyielding as it is meaningless.\" Kingsley Canham said, \"time and again Milestone's career has been written off because of his lack of commitment or to involvement in his work\". Millichap links Milestone's \"profuse, eclectic, and uneven body of work\" to the imperatives of the Hollywood film industry, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Milestone's creativity was rooted in the studio system. Both his best and worst movies resulted from his pragmatic commitment to the cinematic transformation of literary properties presented by the production system... both his strong points and his limitations were generated by that Hollywood system. When he applied his cinematic style to \"strong literary matter\" memorable films resulted; but when he was assigned weak, trivial material, the results were usually mediocre.\nFilm critic and biographer Richard Koszarski considers Milestone \"one of the [1930s] more independent spirits... but like many of the pioneer directors... his relation to the studio system at the height of its [executive] powers was not a productive one\". Koszarski offers a metaphor Milestone had applied to his own final works: \"the latter part of [Milestone]'s career was marked by only sporadic flashes of creativity, a veritable forest of saplings graced by only one or two solitary oaks\".\nFilmography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62263", "revid": "50969773", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62263", "title": "Macaw", "text": "Bird of the parrot family\nMacaws are a group of large New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful, in the tribe Arini. They are popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there are conservation concerns about several species in the wild.\nBiology.\nOf the many different Psittacidae (true parrots) genera, six are classified as macaws: \"Ara\", \"Anodorhynchus\", \"Cyanopsitta\", \"Primolius\", \"Orthopsittaca\", and \"Diopsittaca\". Previously, the members of the genus \"Primolius\" were placed in \"Propyrrhura\", but the former is correct in accordance with ICZN rules. In addition, the related macaw-like thick-billed parrot is sometimes referred to as a \"macaw\", although it is not phylogenetically considered to be a macaw species. Macaws are native to Central America and North America (only Mexico), South America, and formerly the Caribbean. Most species are associated with forests, but others prefer woodland or savannah-like habitats.\nProportionately larger beaks, long tails, and relatively bare, light-coloured medial (facial patch) areas distinguish macaws from other parrots. Sometimes the facial patch is smaller in some species and limited to a yellow patch around the eyes and a second patch near the base of the beak in the members of the genus \"Anodorhynchus\". A macaw's facial feather pattern is as unique as a fingerprint.\nThe largest macaws are the hyacinth, Buffon's (great green) and green-winged macaws. While still relatively large parrots, mini-macaws of the genera \"Cyanopsitta\", \"Orthopsittaca\" and \"Primolius\" are significantly smaller than the members of \"Anodorhynchus\" and \"Ara\". The smallest macaw species, the red-shouldered macaw, is no larger than some parakeets of the genus \"Aratinga\".\nMacaws, like other parrots, toucans and woodpeckers, are zygodactyl, having their first and fourth toes pointing backward.\nSpecies in taxonomic order.\nThere are 19 species of macaws, including extinct and critically endangered species. In addition, there are several hypothetical extinct species that have been proposed based on very little evidence.\nHypothetical extinct species.\nSeveral hypothetical extinct species of macaws have been postulated based on little evidence, and they may have been subspecies, or familiar parrots that were imported onto an island and later wrongly presumed to have a separate identity.\nExtinctions and conservation status.\nThe majority of macaws are now endangered in the wild and a few are extinct. The Spix's macaw is now most likely extinct in the wild. The glaucous macaw is also probably extinct, with only two reliable records of sightings in the 20th century, as well as the blue Macaw. The greatest problems threatening the macaw population are the rapid rate of deforestation and illegal trapping for the bird trade. Prehistoric Native Americans in the American Southwest farmed macaws in establishments known as \"feather factories\".\nInternational trade of all macaw species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Some species of macaws\u2014the scarlet macaw (\"Ara macao\") as an example\u2014are listed in the CITES Appendix I and may not be lawfully traded for commercial purposes. Other species, such as the red-shouldered macaw (\"Diopsittaca nobilis\"), are listed in Appendix II and may legally be traded commercially provided that certain controls are in place, including a non-detriment finding, establishment of an export quota, and issuing of export permits.\nHybrids.\nSometimes macaws are hybridized for the pet trade.\nAviculturists have reported an over-abundance of female blue-and-yellow macaws in captivity, which differs from the general rule with captive macaws and other parrots, where the males are more abundant. This would explain why the blue and gold is the most commonly hybridised macaw, and why the hybridising trend took hold among macaws. Common macaw hybrids include the harlequin (\"Ara ararauna\" \u00d7 \"Ara chloroptera\"), miligold macaw (\"Ara ararauna\" \u00d7 \"Ara militaris\") and the Catalina (known as the rainbow in Australia, \"Ara ararauna\" \u00d7 \"Ara macao\"). In addition, unusual but apparently healthy intergeneric hybrids between the hyacinth macaw and several of the larger \"Ara\" macaws have also occasionally been seen in captivity. Another, much rarer, occurrence of a second-generation hybrid (F2) is the miliquin macaw (harlequin and military macaws).\nDiet and clay licks.\nMacaws eat a variety of foods including seeds, nuts, fruits, palm fruits, leaves, flowers, young shoots, and stems. Safe vegetables include asparagus, beets, bell peppers, broccoli, butternut, carrots, corn on the cob, dandelion greens, collard greens, hot peppers, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and zucchini. Wild species may forage widely, over for some of the larger species such as \"Ara araurana\" (blue and yellow macaw) and \"Ara ambigua\" (great green macaw), in search of seasonally available foods.\nSome foods eaten by macaws in certain regions in the wild are said to contain toxic or caustic substances which they are able to digest. It has been suggested that parrots and macaws in the Amazon Basin eat clay from exposed river banks to neutralize these toxins. In the western Amazon hundreds of macaws and other parrots descend to exposed river banks to consume clay on an almost daily basis \u2013 except on rainy days. Donald Brightsmith, the principal investigator of The Macaw Society, located at the Tambopata Research Center (TRC) in Peru, has studied the clay eating behaviour of parrots at clay licks in Peru. He and fellow investigators found that the soils macaws choose to consume at the clay licks do not have higher levels of cation-exchange capacity (ability to absorb toxins) than that of unused areas of the clay licks and thus the parrots could not be using the clay to neutralize ingested food toxins. Rather, the macaws and other bird and animal species prefer clays with higher levels of sodium. Sodium is a vital element that is scarce in environments greater than 100 kilometres from the ocean. The distribution of clay licks across South America further supports this hypothesis \u2013 as the largest and most species-rich clay licks are found on the western side of the Amazon Basin far from oceanic influences. Salt-enriched (NaCl) oceanic aerosols are the main source of environmental sodium near coasts and this decreases drastically farther inland.\nClay-eating behaviour by macaws is not seen outside the western Amazon region, even though macaws in these areas consume some toxic foods such as the seeds of \"Hura crepitans\", or sandbox tree, which have toxic sap. Species of parrot that consume more seeds, which potentially have more toxins, do not use clay licks more than species that eat a greater proportion of flowers or fruit in their diets.\nStudies at TRC have shown a correlation between clay-lick use and the breeding season. Contents of nestling crop samples show a high percentage of clay fed to them by their parents. Calcium for egg development \u2013 another hypothesis \u2013 does not appear to be a reason for geophagy during this period as peak usage is after the hatching of eggs.\nAnother theory is that the birds, as well as other herbivorous animals, use the clay licks as a source of cobalamin, otherwise known as vitamin B12.\nRelationship with humans.\nMacaws and their feathers have attracted the attention of people throughout history, most notably in pre-Columbian civilizations such as the Inca, Wari', and Nazca. Macaw feathers were highly desired for their bright colors and acquired through hunting and trade. Feathers were often used as adornment and were found at both ceremonial and burial sites. South American weavers have used their feathers to create a number of textiles, most notably feathered panels and tabards. Due to the fragile nature of the feathers, many of these pieces have begun to deteriorate over time.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62264", "revid": "49329771", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62264", "title": "Australian cuisine", "text": "Culinary traditions of Australia\nAustralian cuisine is the food and cooking practices of Australia and its inhabitants. Australia has absorbed culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including British, European, Asian and Middle Eastern.\nIndigenous Australians have occupied Australia for some 65,000 years, during which they developed a unique hunter-gatherer diet, known as bush tucker, drawn from regional Australian plants and animals. Australia became a collection of British colonies from 1788 to 1900, during which time culinary tastes were strongly influenced by British and Irish migrants, with agricultural products such as beef cattle, sheep and wheat becoming staples in the local diet. The Australian gold rushes introduced more varied immigrants and cuisines, mainly Chinese, whilst post-war immigration programs led to a large-scale diversification of local food, mainly due to the influence of migrants from the Mediterranean, East Asia and South Asia.\nAustralian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bush tucker. Australia exports many agricultural products, including cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, nuts, wheat, barley and canola. Australia also produces wine, beer and soft drinks.\nWhile fast food chains are abundant, Australia's metropolitan areas have restaurants that offer both local and international foods. Restaurants which include contemporary adaptations, interpretations or fusions of exotic influences are frequently termed Modern Australian.\nHistory.\nIndigenous Australian bush food.\nIndigenous Australians have lived off native flora and fauna of the Australian bush for over 60,000 years. In modern times, this collection of foods and customs has become known as bush tucker.\nIt is understood that up to 5,000 species of Australian flora and fauna were eaten by Indigenous Australians. Hunting of kangaroo, wallaby and emu was common, with other foods widely consumed including bogong moths, witchetty grubs, lizards and snakes. Bush berries, fruits, and nuts were also used, including the now widely cultivated macadamia nut, and wild honeys were also exploited. Fish were caught using tools such as spears, hooks and traps; in some areas, the construction of complex weir systems allowed the development of forms of aquaculture.\nResource availability and dietary make-up varied from region to region and scientific theories of bush tucker plants being spread by hand have recently emerged. Food preparation techniques also varied; however, a common cooking technique was for the carcass to be thrown directly on a campfire to be roasted.\nNative food sources were used to supplement the colonists' diet following the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in 1788.\nDevelopment of Australian cuisine.\nFollowing the pre-colonial period, European colonisers began arriving with the First Fleet at Sydney harbour in 1788. The diet consisted of \"bread, salted meat and tea with lashings of rum (initially from the West Indies but later made from the waste cane of the sugar industry in Queensland).\" The British found familiar game in Australia including swan, goose, pigeon and fish, but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. Meat constituted a large proportion of the Australian diet during the colonial era and into the 20th century.\nAfter initial difficulties, Australian agriculture became a major global producer and supplied fresh produce for the local market. Stock grazing (mostly sheep and cattle) is prevalent throughout the continent. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia's main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia and wheat is a main component of the Australian diet. Today there are over 85,681 farm businesses in Australia, 99 percent of which are locally owned and operated.\nBarbecued meat is almost synonymous with Australian cuisine, though it is estimated that more than 10% of Australians are now vegetarian.\nModern Australian cuisine.\nAfter World War II, subsequent waves of multicultural immigration, with a majority drawn from Asia and the Mediterranean region, and the strong, sophisticated food cultures these ethnic communities have brought with them influenced the development of Australian cuisine. This blending of \"European techniques and Asian flavours\" came to be known as Modern Australian cuisine.\nArguably the first Modern Australian restaurant was Sydney's Bayswater Brasserie (est. 1982), which offered Mediterranean dishes with Asian and Middle Eastern influences and \"showed Sydney [...] that food can be adventurous without being expensive\". The term itself was first used in print in the 1993 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald \"Good Food Guide\", which placed 34 restaurants under this heading, and was quickly adopted to describe the burgeoning food scene in Sydney in the 1990s. Leading exponents of the style include Tetsuya Wakuda, Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore.\nAs of 2014, the term is considered somewhat dated, with many restaurants preferring to call their style \"contemporary Australian cuisine\" instead.\nFruit and vegetables.\nFruit.\nThere are many species of Australian native fruits, such as quandong (native peach), wattleseed, muntries/munthari berry, Illawarra plums, riberry, native raspberries, and lilli pillies, as well as a range of native citrus species including the desert lime and finger lime. These usually fall under the category of bush tucker, which is used in some restaurants and in commercial preserves and pickles but not generally well known among Australians due to its low availability.\nAustralia also has large fruit-growing regions in most states for tropical fruits in the north, and stone fruits and temperate fruits in the south which has a mediterranean or temperate climate. The Granny Smith variety of apples originated in Sydney in 1868. Another well-known Western Australian apple variety is the Cripps Pink, known locally and internationally as \"Pink Lady\" apples, which was first cultivated in 1973.\nFruits cultivated and consumed in Australia include apples, banana, kiwifruit, oranges and other citrus, mangoes (seasonally), mandarin, stonefruit, avocado, watermelons, rockmelons, lychees, pears, nectarines, plums, apricots, grapes, melons, papaya (also called pawpaw), pineapple, passionfruit and berries (strawberries, raspberries, etc.).\nVegetables.\nIn the temperate regions of Australia vegetables are traditionally eaten seasonally, especially in regional areas, although in urban areas there is large-scale importation of fresh produce sourced from around the world by supermarkets and wholesalers for grocery stores, to meet demands for year-round availability. Spring vegetables include artichoke, asparagus, bean shoots, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, leek, lettuce, mushrooms, peas, rhubarb, and spinach; summer vegetables include capsicum, cucumber, eggplant, squash, tomato, and zucchini.\nMeat and poultry.\nChicken is the most commonly consumed of all meats or poultry by weight, with approximately 47 kilograms of chicken consumed by the average Australian per year.\nAs of \u00a02018[ [update]] Australians ate around 25 kilograms of beef per person with beef having a 35% share of fresh meat sales by value, the highest of any fresh meat in 2018\u201319.\nLamb is very popular in Australia, with roasting cuts (legs and shoulders), chops, and shanks being the most common cuts. Lamb will often form part of either a Sunday roast or a barbecue. It is also commonly found as an ingredient in gyros (\"yiros\") and doner kebabs, brought by Greek and Turkish immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Australia consumes more lamb and mutton than any other country listed by the OECD-FAO (with Kazakhstan in second place). In 2017, Australians consumed an average of per person. By way of comparison, New Zealanders average and Americans just .\nLunch at an Australian pub is called a \"counter lunch\", while the term \"counter meal\" is used for either lunch or dinner. Common dishes served at counter lunches and counter meals are steak and chips, chicken parmigiana and chips, a mixed grill (an assortment of grilled meats), and roast lamb or beef with roast vegetables.\nLunch meats are known as smallgoods in Australia and New Zealand, referring to products such as ham, bacon, sausages or salami.\nGame.\nKangaroo meat is available as game in Australia, although it is not among the most commonly eaten meats. In colonial-era recipes, kangaroo was treated much like ox tail, and braised until tender forming a rich gravy. It is available today in various cuts and sausages. Kangaroo is, however, a common commercial dog food in Australia.\nOther less commonly eaten forms of game are emu and crocodile.\nFish and seafood.\nSeafood consumption is increasing, but it is less common in the Australian diet than poultry and beef.\nAustralian cuisine features Australian seafood such as southern bluefin tuna, King George whiting, Moreton Bay bugs, mud crab, jewfish, dhufish (Western Australia) and yabby. Australia is one of the largest producers of abalone and rock lobster.\nFish and chips is a take-away food that originated in the United Kingdom and remains popular in Australia. It generally consists of battered deep-fried fish with deep-fried chipped (slab-cut) potatoes. Rather than cod which is more common in the UK, the most popular fish at Australian fish and chips shops, at least in southern Australian states, is flake, a fillet of gummy shark (\"Mustelus antarcticus\").\nFlathead is also a popular sport and table fish found in all parts of Australia. Barramundi is a fish found in northern Australian river systems. Bay lobsters, better known in Australia as Moreton Bay bugs, are common in seafood restaurants, or may be served with steak as \"surf and turf\".\nThe most common species of the aquaculture industry are salmon, tuna, oysters, and prawns. Other food species include abalone, freshwater finfish (such as barramundi, Murray cod, silver perch), brackish water or marine finfish (such as barramundi, snapper, yellowtail kingfish, mulloway, groupers), mussels, mud crabs and sea cucumbers.\nWhile inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide freshwater game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy. Approximately 600 varieties of marine and freshwater seafood species are caught and sold in Australia for both local and overseas consumption. European carp, common in the Murray River as an invasive species, is not considered edible by most Australians despite being common in cuisines across Europe.\nDairy.\nEver since the first British settlement of 1788, Australia has had a dairy industry. Today, the Australian dairy industry produces a wide variety of milk, cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt products.\nAustralians are high consumers of dairy products, consuming on average some of milk per person a year, of cheese, of butter (a small reduction from previous year, largely for dietary purposes) and of yoghurt products.\nBeverages.\nTea.\nFor most of Australia's history following the arrival of British settlers, black tea was the most commonly consumed hot beverage; however, in the 1980s, coffee overtook tea in popularity. In the 19th century, billy tea was a staple drink for those out in the Australian bush, such as those working on the land or travelling overland. Boiling water for tea in a billy over a camp fire and adding a gum leaf for flavouring remains an iconic traditional Australian method for preparing tea. Famously, it was prepared by the ill-fated swagman in the Australian folksong \"Waltzing Matilda\".\nTea and biscuits or freshly home-baked scones are common for afternoon tea between friends and family.\nCoffee.\nToday's Australia has a distinct coffee culture. The coffee industry has grown from independent cafes since the early 20th century. The flat white became popular in Australia some time after 1985, and its invention is claimed by a Sydneysider (although this claim is disputed by a New Zealand-based barista). The iconic Greek caf\u00e9s of Sydney and Melbourne were the first to introduce locally roasted coffees in 1910. US military personnel stationed in Australia during the Second World War helped to spread the habit of coffee drinking, initially in the form of instant coffee.\nIn 1952, the first espresso machines began to appear in Australia and a plethora of fine Italian coffee houses were emerging in Melbourne and Sydney. Pellegrini's Espresso Bar and Legend Caf\u00e9 often lay claim to being Melbourne's first 'real' espresso bars, opening their doors in 1954 and 1956 respectively. This decade also saw the establishment of one of Australia's most iconic coffee brands, Vittoria, which remains the country's largest coffee maker and distributor. The brand has existed in Australia since 1958, well before it moved to the US.\nTo this day, international coffee chains such as Starbucks have very little market share in Australia, with Australia's long established independent caf\u00e9s existing along with homegrown franchises such as The Coffee Club, Michel's Patisserie, D\u00f4me in WA, and Zarraffas Coffee in Queensland. One reason for this is that unlike with the United States and Asia, Australia for many decades had already had an established culture of independent caf\u00e9s before coffee chains tried to enter the market.\nOther hot beverages.\nThe chocolate and malt powder Milo, which was developed by Thomas Mayne in Sydney in 1934 in response to the Great Depression, is mixed with cold or hot milk to produce a popular beverage. In recent years, Milo has been exported and is also commonly consumed in Southeast Asia even becoming a major ingredient in some desserts produced in the region.\nAlcohol.\nBeer in Australia has been popular since colonial times. James Squire is considered to have founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798 and the Cascade Brewery in Hobart, Tasmania, has been operating since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally \u2013 with Foster's Lager being an iconic export brand. However, Fosters is not a large seller on the local market, with alternatives such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught outselling the popular export. Craft beer is popular, as well as distinctive products from smaller breweries such as Coopers and Little Creatures.\nThe Australian wine industry is the fifth largest exporter of wine around the world, with 760 million litres a year to a large international export market and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation's economy. Australians consume over 530\u00a0million litres annually with a per capita consumption of about 30 litres \u2013 50% white table wine, 35% red table wine. Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares. Australia's wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Amongst the most famous wine districts are the Barossa Valley, Hunter Valley, Margaret River and Yarra Valley, and among the best known wine producers are Lindeman's, Penfolds, Rosemount Estate, Wynns Coonawarra Estate. In Australia's tropical regions, wine is produced from exotic fruits such as mango, passion fruit and lychees.\nIn modern times, South Australia has also become known for its growing number of premium spirits producers, with the South Australian Spirits industry quickly emerging as a world leader with producers being recognised globally such as Seppeltsfield Road Distillers, Never Never Distilling, Adelaide Hills Distilling and many more.\nRum served as a currency during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Australia when metallic currency was in short supply.\nTake-away and convenience foods.\nThe traditional places to buy take-away food in Australia has long been at a local milk bar, fish and chip shop, or bakery, though these have met with stiff competition from fast food chains and convenience stores in recent decades.\nIconic Australian take-away food (i.e. fast food) includes meat pies, sausage rolls, pasties, Chiko Rolls, and dim sims. Meat pies, sausage rolls, and pasties are often found at milk bars, bakeries, and petrol stations, often kept hot in a pie warmer or needing to be microwaved; meat pies are also a staple at Australian Rules football matches. Chiko Rolls, dim sims and other foods needing to be deep-fried are to be found at fish and chip shops, which have the necessary deep fryers in which to cook them.\nBread rolls, with a variety of fillings, are a common alternative to sandwiches, with double-cut rolls (effectively two sandwiches) a South Australian specialty.\nAustralian hamburgers and steak sandwiches are mainly to be found at fish and chip shops. Australian hamburgers consist of a grilled beef patty, served with shredded lettuce and sliced tomato in a (usually toasted) round bread roll or bun, along with tomato sauce (less commonly, barbecue sauce). Common options to add include bacon, cheese, fried onions, fried egg, a slice of beetroot, and a slice of pineapple. A slice of gherkin is rarely included; these are a feature of burgers from American chains, not Australian. Steak sandwiches come with the same options, but instead of a beef patty, they consist of a thin steak and are served in two slices of toast, not buns.\nPizza has also become a popular take-away food item in Australia.\nCommonly found at community and fundraising events are sausage sizzle stalls \u2013 a stall with a barbecue hot plate on which sausages are cooked. At a sausage sizzle the sausage is served in a slice of white bread, with or without tomato sauce and with the option of adding fried onions, and eaten as a snack or as a light lunch. A sausage sizzle at a polling station on any Australian state or Federal election day has humorously become known as a Democracy sausage. Similar stalls are held in the car parks of most Bunnings hardware stores on weekends, by volunteers fund-raising for service clubs, charities, societies or sporting groups. The company supplies the infrastructure and enforces standards, including prices.\nThe halal snack pack (\"HSP\", also known in South Australia as an AB) originated in Australia as a fusion of Middle Eastern and European flavours, common at kebab shops around Australia. It consists of doner kebab meat served over hot chips and covered in sauces (such as chilli, garlic, or barbecue sauce).\nBaked goods and desserts.\nDamper is a traditional Australian bread prepared by swagmen, drovers and other travellers. It is a wheat-flour-based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire. Toast is commonly eaten at breakfast. An iconic commercial spread is Vegemite, a salty, B vitamin-rich savoury spread made from brewers yeast eaten on buttered toast, commonly at breakfast, or in sandwiches. A common children's treat dating back to the 1920s is fairy bread, appearing around the same time as the Boston bun.\nA classic Australian biscuit is the ANZAC biscuit, which are often homemade and so-called as they were sent by families and friends to Australian soldiers fighting in Europe and the Dardanelles in the First World War. A popular commercial brand of biscuit are Arnott's Tim Tams.\nA classic Australian cake is the lamington, made from two squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut.The food is sweet. Another popular cake and dessert dish is the pavlova, a meringue-based dessert; however, the origins of this are contested as New Zealand also lays claim to its invention. The Neenish tart is one more Australian baked good, with a pastry base, dried icing in two colours on top, and a filling of cream/jam.\nThe mango pancake, a stable of Yum Cha restaurants in Sydney and elsewhere in Australia, is believed to have originated in Sydney in the late 1980s and early 1990s.\nRegional foods.\nAs well as national icons there are many regional iconic foods.\nNew South Wales.\n\"Saccostrea glomerata\", known in Australia as the Sydney rock oyster, or, more recently, as just the rock oyster, is a culinary delicacy in Sydney. Rock oysters are also popular in other NSW locations such as Merimbula; in 2025, Destination NSW reported that oyster trails, tours and tastings were supporting a rising demand for agritourism in that State. Endemic to Australia and New Zealand, rock oysters inhabit sheltered estuaries and bays between Hervey Bay, Queensland, and Wingan Inlet, Victoria (amongst other places in Australia), and are also commercially grown, predominantly on NSW's coastline.\nAn associated dish, carpetbag steak, became popular in Sydney in about 1950. As eaten in that city, it is made up of a thick cut of beef with a deep incision filled with rock oysters, usually dipped in Worcestershire sauce. Sometimes the filling is supplemented with butter, lemon juice, parsley, bread crumbs, or shredded cheese. The filled steak is then either pan fried or oven broiled, and most often served rare.\nCarpetbag steak is not an Australian invention; it traces its origins to Mumbles, an oyster-fishing village in Swansea, South Wales, UK. But after finding favour in Sydney, its popularity spread, with local variations, to the United Kingdom, South Africa, and other places. In the United States, radio programs broadcast in the early 1950s associated the dish with Australia, as did news articles published in the 1970s, 1980s, and 2000s. Meanwhile, in Australia as a whole, carpetbag steak experienced \"something of a heyday\" in the 1950s and 1960s, and was an \"iconic menu item\" until the 1990s. As of 2025[ [update]], it was still on the menu of Charcoal Restaurant, a long-established steak house in Canberra.\nQueensland.\nQueensland has Weis Fruit Bar and claims the lamington.\nThe cuisine of Brisbane derives from mainstream Australian cuisine, as well as many cuisines of international origin. Major native foods of the Brisbane region and commonly used in local cuisine include the macadamia, lemon-scented myrtle, Australian finger lime, bunya nut, and Moreton Bay bug. The city's cuisine culture is often described as casual with an emphasis on outdoor dining. Roof-top dining has become an iconic part of the culinary landscape, as well as a large street food scene with food trucks and pop-up bars common.\nBrisbane also lays claim to several foods including \"smashed avo\". Although popularised in Sydney in the 1990s, smashed avocado was a common dish in Brisbane and Queensland dating back to the 1920s.\nSouth Australia.\nSouth Australia has FruChocs, King George whiting, and a range of foods of German origin including mettwurst, Bienenstich (beesting), streuselkuchen (German cake) and fritz.\nThe State also has its own iconic brands such as Farmers Union Iced Coffee, YoYo biscuits and Balfours frog cakes. Jubilee cake is a specialty of South Australia, as is the Kitchener bun.\nIn Adelaide, a variant on the meat pie is the pie floater, which is a meat pie served in a bowl of pea soup.\nTasmania.\nTasmania has leatherwood honey, abalone, and savoury toast. \nVictoria.\nVictoria is famous for its home-grown Melbourne invention, the dim sim. Melbourne is also the home of the hot jam donut. \nWestern Australia.\nIn Western Australia, the conti roll, or continental roll, is a popular sandwich, and has been described as both \" ... a singularly Western Australian creation ...\" and \"... the closest thing ... West Australians have to a regional sandwich.\" It may have been born, and certainly was raised, in the inner-city Perth locality now known as Northbridge. Another WA treat is green-coloured, spearmint-flavoured milk.\nIn the 1970s, Peter Kailis, co-founder of the now national WA-originated fast food chain Red Rooster, invented the Hawaiian Pack, made up of rotisserie chicken, a deep-fried banana and a pineapple ring. As of 2025[ [update]], Red Rooster was no longer selling a Hawaiian Pack. However, its \"Box Meals\" menu included a \"Trop Box\" with pineapple rings but no banana, and its WA-based rival Chicken Treat was offering a \"Hawaiian Quarter\" with \"Pineapple Fritter, [and] Deep Fried Bananas\". Other fast food outlets with origins, or Australian origins, in WA include Hungry Jack's, Nando's, and the now-defunct Chooks Fresh &amp; Tasty.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62266", "revid": "45764203", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62266", "title": "William Wyler", "text": "German-born American filmmaker (1902\u20131981)\nWilliam Wyler (; born Willi Wyler (); July 1, 1902 \u2013 July 27, 1981) was a German-born American film director and producer. Known for his work in numerous genres over five decades, he received numerous awards and accolades, including three Academy Awards. He holds the record of twelve nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director. For his oeuvre of work, Wyler was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award, and the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.\nWyler emigrated to the United States in 1921 where he worked first for Universal Studios in New York before moving to Los Angeles. By 1925, he was the youngest director at Universal, and in 1929 he directed \"Hell's Heroes\", Universal's first sound production filmed entirely on location. Wyler went on to win the Academy Award for Best Director three times, for \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), and \"Ben-Hur\" (1959), all of which also won for Best Picture. He was Oscar-nominated for \"Dodsworth\" (1936), \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939), \"The Letter\" (1940), \"The Little Foxes\" (1941), \"The Heiress\" (1949), \"Detective Story\" (1952), \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), \"Friendly Persuasion\" (1956), and \"The Collector\" (1965).\nFilm historian Ian Freer calls Wyler a \"bona fide perfectionist\", whose penchant for retakes and an attempt to hone every last nuance \"became the stuff of legend.\" His ability to direct a string of classic literary adaptations into huge box-office and critical successes made him one of \"Hollywood's most bankable moviemakers\" from the 1930s to the 1960s. Through his talent for staging, editing, and camera movement, he turned dynamic theatrical spaces into cinematic ones. Wyler is also known for his work as an actors' director, often propelling them to stardom.\nEarly life.\nWyler was born to a Jewish family in Mulhouse, Alsace-Lorraine (then part of the German Empire, now France). His Swiss-born father Leopold started as a traveling salesman but later became a thriving haberdasher in Mulhouse. His mother, Melanie (n\u00e9e Auerbach; died February 13, 1955, Los Angeles, aged 77), was German-born, and a cousin of Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal Pictures. During Wyler's childhood, he attended a number of schools and developed a reputation as \"something of a hellraiser\", being expelled more than once for misbehavior. His mother often took him and his older brother Robert to concerts, opera, and the theatre, as well as the early cinema. Sometimes at home his family and their friends would stage amateur theatricals for personal enjoyment.\nWyler was supposed to inherit the family haberdashery business in Mulhouse. After World War I and the ceding of Alsace-Lorraine to France, he spent a dismal year working in Paris at \"100.000 Chemises\" selling shirts and ties. He was so poor that he often spent his time wandering around the Pigalle district. After realizing that Willy was not interested in the haberdashery business, his mother, Melanie, contacted her distant cousin, Carl Laemmle, who owned Universal Studios, about opportunities for him.\nLaemmle was in the habit of coming to Europe each year, searching for promising young men who would work in the United States. In 1921, Wyler, while traveling as a Swiss citizen (his father's status automatically conferred Swiss citizenship on his sons), met Laemmle who hired him to work at Universal Studios in New York. As Wyler said: \"America seemed as far away as the moon.\" Booked onto a ship to New York with Laemmle for his return voyage, Wyler met a young Czech man, Paul Kohner (later the famous independent agent), aboard the same ship. Their enjoyment of the first class trip was short-lived, however, as they found they had to repay the cost of the passage out of their $25 weekly income as messengers to Universal Pictures. After working in New York for several years, and even serving in the New York Army National Guard for a year, Wyler moved to Hollywood to become a director.\nCareer.\n1923\u20131929: Early work and silent films.\nAround 1923, Wyler arrived in Los Angeles and began work on the Universal Studios lot in the swing gang, cleaning the stages and moving the sets. His break came when he was hired as a second assistant editor. But his work ethic was uneven, and he would often sneak off and play billiards in a pool hall across the street from the studio, or organize card games during working hours. After some ups and downs (including getting fired), Wyler put all his efforts into becoming a director. He started as a third assistant director and by 1925 he became the youngest director on the Universal lot directing the westerns that Universal was famed for turning out. Wyler was so engrossed in his work that he would dream about \"different ways (for an actor) to get on a horse\". In several of the one-reelers, he would join the posse in the inevitable chase of the 'bad man'.\nHe directed his first non-Western, the lost \"Anybody Here Seen Kelly?\", in 1928. This was followed by his first part-talkie films, \"The Shakedown\" and \"The Love Trap\". He proved himself an able craftsman. In 1928 he became a naturalized United States citizen. His first all-talking film, and Universal's first sound production to be filmed entirely on location, was \"Hell's Heroes\", filmed in the Mojave Desert in 1929.\n1930\u20131949: Career acclaim and stardom.\nIn the early 1930s Wyler directed a wide variety of films at Universal, ranging from high-profile dramas such as \"The Storm\", \"A House Divided\" with Walter Huston, and \"Counsellor at Law\" with John Barrymore, to comedies like \"Her First Mate\" with Zasu Pitts and \"The Good Fairy\" with Margaret Sullavan. He became well known for his insistence on multiple retakes, resulting in often award-winning and critically acclaimed performances from his actors. After leaving Universal he began a long collaboration with Samuel Goldwyn for whom he directed such classics as \"Dodsworth\" (1936) where he earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. The film starred Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor, \"sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness.\" He also directed \"These Three\" (1936) with Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon, \"Dead End\" (1937) with Humphrey Bogart, \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939) with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, \"The Westerner\" (1940) with Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan, \"The Little Foxes\" (1941) with Bette Davis, and \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946) with Myrna Loy and Fredric March.\nWyler's visual style pioneered long, uncut takes in what has come to be called deep-focus cinematography - the use of lenses which can take in the entire depth of a room, keeping everything in focus, i.e. depth of field, and thus can contain dramatic changes in lighting and characters' movements in the same shot. In this, he collaborated with the pathbreaking young cinematographer of 1940's \"Citizen Kane\", Gregg Toland. Gregg Toland shot three of the director's most celebrated films: \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939), where Toland's use of low angles, dark shadows and diffusion won him the Oscar for best cinematography; next in Lillian Hellman's adaptation of her searing stage play, \"The Little Foxes\", into Wyler's 1941 film, which had Wyler and Toland working closely together to bring the hard-edged deep focus from Citizen Kane to bear on another tale of soul-destroying family wealth - including inventing a totally white make-up scheme for its star, Bette Davis, conveying her soullessness. Third, and most famously, is Toland's work in one of the cinematographer's last films, Wyler's heart-wrenching masterpiece, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946). This story of three American servicemen struggling to adjust to civilian life after fighting in World War 2 hit a chord with postwar audiences. Memorable examples of deep focus here include the complex scene in which the three men wind up at the same bar, unable to stay at home, and, in its powerful closing shot, a crowded family wedding disperses, leaving only two young lovers staring at one another across the expanse of an empty living room, as stunned in place, seemingly, as the camera. All three films were decorated with multiple Oscars (see the following section).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIt was all Wyler. I had known all the horrors of no direction and bad direction. I now knew what a great director was and what he could mean to an actress. I will always be grateful to him for his toughness and his genius.\n\u2014Bette Davis, discussing \"Jezebel\"\nBette Davis received three Oscar nominations for her screen work under Wyler, and won her second Oscar for her performance in Wyler's 1938 film \"Jezebel\". She told Merv Griffin in 1972 that Wyler trained her with that film to be a \"far, far better actress\" than she had been. She recalled a scene that was only a bare paragraph in the script, but \"without a word of dialog, Willy created a scene of power and tension. This was moviemaking on the highest plane,\" she said. \"A scene of such suspense that I never have not marveled at the direction of it.\" During her acceptance speech when she received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1977, she thanked him.\nLaurence Olivier, whom Wyler directed in \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939) for his first Oscar nomination, credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen, despite clashing with Wyler on multiple occasions. Olivier would go on to hold the record for the most nominations in the Best Actor category at nine, tied with Spencer Tracy. Critic Frank S. Nugent wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"William Wyler has directed it magnificently. It is, unquestionably, one of the most distinguished pictures of the year.\" \"Variety\" described Olivier's performance as \"fantastic... he not only brings conviction to his portrayal but translates intelligently its mystical quality.\"\nFive years later, in 1944, while visiting London, Wyler met with Olivier and his actress wife, Vivien Leigh. She invited him to see her performance in \"The Doctor's Dilemma\", and Olivier asked him to direct him in his planned film, \"Henry V\". But Wyler said he was \"not a Shakespearian\" and turned down the offer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIf any film actor is having trouble with his career, can't master the medium and, anyway, wonders whether it's worth it, let him pray to meet a man like William Wyler.\n\u2014Laurence Olivier\nIn 1950, Wyler and Olivier made a second film together, \"Carrie\", which was not a commercial success. However, some critics state that it nonetheless contains Olivier's finest film performance, but because of its old-fashioned story, the film was very under-appreciated: In critic Michael Billington's opinion:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If there were any justice in the world, Laurence Olivier would have got an Oscar for his unforgettable performance in \"Carrie\".\nDirector and screenwriter John Huston had been a close friend of Wyler during his career. When he was twenty-eight and penniless, sleeping in parks in London, Huston returned to Hollywood to see if he could find work. Wyler, four years his senior, had met Huston when he was directing his father, Walter Huston, in \"A House Divided\" in 1931, and they got along well. Wyler read dialogue suggestions that Huston had given to his father Walter and hired John to work on the dialogue for the script. He later inspired Huston to become a director and became his \"early mentor.\" When America entered World War II in 1941, Wyler, Huston, Anatole Litvak and Frank Capra, by then all directors, enlisted at the same time. Later in his career, Huston recalled his friendship with Wyler during an interview:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Willy was certainly my best friend in the industry... We seemed instantly to have many things in common... Willy liked the things that I liked. We'd go down to Mexico. We'd go up in the mountains. And we'd gamble. He was a wonderful companion...He was equally capable of playing Beethoven on his violin, speeding around town on his motorcycle, or schussing down steep virgin snow trails.\nWyler and the Second World War.\nIn 1941, Wyler directed \"Mrs. Miniver\", based on the 1940 novel; it was the story of a middle-class English family adjusting to the war in Europe and the bombing blitz in London. It starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. Pidgeon originally had doubts about taking on the role, until fellow actor Paul Lukas told him, \"You will find working with Wyler to be the most delightful experience you ever had, and that's the way it turned out.\" Pidgeon recalled: \"One thing that would have been a terrific regret in my life is if I had succeeded in getting out of doing \"Mrs. Miniver\"\" He received his first Oscar nomination for his role, while his co-star, Greer Garson, won her first and only Academy Award for her performance.\nThe film idea was controversial because it was intended to cause the United States to be less isolationist. It was thought that by seeing the suffering of British citizens depicted in fiction story, Americans might be made more willing to aid Britain during their war effort. The film succeeded in its propagandistic aims, eliciting sympathy for the British people by showing Britain during its darkest days of the war. Years later, having been in the war himself, Wyler said that the film \"only scratched the surface of war... It was incomplete.\"\nU.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph Kennedy told the studios to stop making pro-British and anti-German films, because he believed that British defeat was imminent. But MGM producer Eddie Mannix disagreed, saying that \"someone should salute England. And even if we lose $100,000, that'll be okay.\" \"Mrs. Miniver\" went on to win six Academy Awards, becoming the top box office hit of 1942. It was Wyler's first Academy Award for Best Director.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDear Mad Willy. I saw \"Mrs. Miniver\" last night. It is absolutely wonderful. You repeatedly amaze me with the demonstrations of your talent and I ask you to believe that it is with genuine pleasure that I salute this latest and greatest example of your work.\n \u2014producer David Selznick\nPresident Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill both loved the film, said historian Emily Yellin, and Roosevelt wanted prints rushed to theaters nationwide. The Voice of America radio network broadcast the minister's speech from the film, magazines reprinted it, and it was copied onto leaflets and dropped over German-occupied countries. Churchill sent MGM chief Louis B. Mayer a telegram claiming that \"\"Mrs. Miniver\" is propaganda worth 100 battleships.\" Bosley Crowther wrote in his \"New York Times\" review that \"Mrs. Miniver\" was the finest film yet made about the war, \"and a most exalting tribute to the British.\"\nBetween 1942 and 1945, Wyler volunteered to serve as a major in the United States Army Air Forces and directed a pair of documentaries: \"\" (1944), about a Boeing B-17 and its U.S. Army Air Force crew; and \"Thunderbolt!\" (1947), highlighting a P-47 fighter-bomber squadron in the Mediterranean. Wyler filmed \"The Memphis Belle\" at great personal risk, flying over enemy territory on actual bombing missions in 1943; on one flight, Wyler lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Wyler's associate, cinematographer Harold J. Tannenbaum, a First Lieutenant, was shot down and perished during the filming. Director Steven Spielberg describes Wyler's filming of \"Memphis Belle\" in the 2017 Netflix series, \"Five Came Back\". Before being assigned to the Air Force, Wyler was hired to direct the documentary \"The Negro Soldier\" on African-Americans in the United States Armed Forces.\nWorking on \"Thunderbolt!\" Wyler was exposed to such loud noise that he passed out. When he awoke, he found he was deaf in one ear. Partial hearing with the aid of a hearing aid eventually came back years later. Wyler returned from the War a lieutenant colonel and a disabled veteran.\nReturning from the War and unsure whether he could work again, Wyler turned to a subject that he knew well and directed a film which captured the mood of the nation as it turned to peace after the war, \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946). This story of the homecoming of three veterans from World War II dramatized the problems of returning veterans in their adjustment back to civilian life. Arguably his most personal film, \"Best Years\" drew on Wyler's own experience returning home to his family after three years at the front. \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" won the Academy Award for Best Director (Wyler's second) and Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six other Academy Awards including one Academy Honorary Award.\nIn 1949, Wyler directed \"The Heiress\", which earned Olivia de Havilland her second Oscar and garnered additional Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Music. The film is considered by some to be a highlight in her career, \"that could strike envy even in the most versatile and successful actress,\" according to one critic.\nDe Havilland had seen the play in New York and felt she could play the lead perfectly. She then called Wyler to convince him to have Paramount buy the film rights. He flew to New York to see the play and moved by the story, persuaded the studio to buy it. Along with de Havilland, he managed to get Montgomery Clift and Ralph Richardson to co-star.\n1950\u20131959: Established director.\nIn 1951, Wyler produced and directed Kirk Douglas and Eleanor Parker in \"Detective Story\", portraying a day in the lives of the various people in a detective squad. Lee Grant and Joseph Wiseman made their screen debuts in the film, which was nominated for four Academy Awards, including one for Grant. Critic Bosley Crowther lauded the film, describing it as \"a brisk, absorbing film by producer-director William Wyler, with the help of a fine, responsive cast.\"\n\"Carrie\" was released in 1952 starring Jennifer Jones in the title role and Laurence Olivier as Hurstwood. Eddie Albert played Charles Drouet. Carrie received two Academy Award nominations: Costume Design (Edith Head), and Best Art Direction (Hal Pereira, Roland Anderson, Emile Kuri). Wyler was reluctant to cast Jennifer Jones, and the filming was subsequently plagued by a variety of troubles. Jones had not revealed that she was pregnant; Wyler was mourning the death of his year-old son; Olivier had a painful leg ailment, and he developed a dislike for Jones. Hollywood was reeling under the effects of McCarthyism, and the studio was afraid to distribute a film that could be attacked as immoral. Ultimately, the ending was changed and the film was cut to make it more positive in tone.\nDuring the immediate postwar period, Wyler directed a handful of critically acclaimed and influential films. \"Roman Holiday\" (1953) introduced Audrey Hepburn to U.S. audiences in her first starring role, winning her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Wyler said of Hepburn years later, when describing truly great actresses, \"In that league there's only ever been Garbo, and the other Hepburn, and maybe Bergman. It's a rare quality, but boy, do you know when you've found it.\" The film was an instant hit, also winning for Best Costume Design (Edith Head), and Best Writing (Dalton Trumbo). Hepburn would eventually do three movies with Wyler, who her son said was one of the most important directors in her career.\n\"Friendly Persuasion\" (1956) was awarded the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm) at the Cannes Film Festival. And in 1959, Wyler directed \"Ben-Hur\", which won 11 Oscars, a feat unequaled until \"Titanic\" in 1997 and \"\" in 2003. He had also assisted in the production of the .\nWyler and its star, Charlton Heston, both knew what the film meant for MGM, which had massive investments in its outcome, with the film's budget having gone from $7\u00a0million to $15\u00a0million, and the fact that MGM was already in dire financial straits. They were aware that if it failed at the box office, MGM might go bankrupt.\nThe film, like many epics, was difficult to make. When Heston was asked which scene he enjoyed doing most, he said \"I didn't enjoy any of it. It was hard work.\" Part of the reason for that was the financial stress placed on making the film a success. With a cast of fifteen thousand extras, a leading star, and shot on 70mm film with stereophonic tracks, it was the most expensive film ever made at that time. The nine-minute chariot race, for example, took six months to film.\n\"Ben-Hur\" became a great box office success. Wyler won his third Academy Award for Best Director and Charlton Heston his first and only Academy Award as its star. Heston recalled in his autobiography that at first he had doubts about playing the role. But his agent advised him otherwise: \"Don't you know that actors take parts with Wyler without even reading the damn script? I'm telling you, you \"have\" to do this picture!\"\nKirk Douglas had lobbied Wyler, who directed him in \"Detective Story\" in 1951, for the title role, but only after Wyler had already decided on Heston. He offered him instead the role of Messala, which Douglas rejected. Douglas then went on to star in \"Spartacus\" (1960).\n\"Ben-Hur\" cost $15\u00a0million to produce but earned $47\u00a0million by the end of 1961 and $90\u00a0million worldwide. Audiences mobbed movie theaters in the months after it opened. Critic Pauline Kael praised Wyler's achievement:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n1960\u20131970: Later work and final films.\nIn 1961, he became a director for 20th Century Fox and also cast James Garner in \"The Children's Hour\" with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. Garner had beaten Warner Bros. in a lawsuit, enabling him to leave the television series \"Maverick\", and had been briefly graylisted as a result but Wyler broke the graylist by casting him; the following year, Garner played a leading role in four major motion pictures.\nIn 1968, he directed Barbra Streisand in her debut film, \"Funny Girl\", costarring Omar Sharif, which became a huge financial success. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and like Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role, Streisand won as Best Actress, becoming the thirteenth actor to win an Oscar under his direction.\nStreisand had already starred in the Broadway musical of \"Funny Girl\", with seven hundred performances. And although she knew the part well, Wyler still had to mold her stage role for the screen. She naturally wanted to be involved in the film's production, often asking Wyler questions, but they got along well. \"Things were ironed out when she discovered some of us knew what we were doing,\" kidded Wyler.\nWhat originally attracted him to direct Streisand was similar to what attracted him to Audrey Hepburn, who had also been new to film audiences. He met with Streisand during her musical run and became excited at the prospect of guiding another new star into an award-winning performance. He sensed and admired that Streisand had the same kind of dedication to being an actress as did Bette Davis, early in her career. \"It just needed to be controlled and toned down for the movie camera.\" Wyler said afterwards, \"I'm terribly fond of her. She was very professional, very good, a hard worker, too hard at times. She would work day and night if you would let her. She is absolutely tireless\".\nWyler was hired to direct \"Patton\" (1970), but quit before the beginning of production in 1969. \nThe last film Wyler directed was \"The Liberation of L.B. Jones\", released in 1970.\nStyle and technique.\nVisual style.\nWyler had worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland for six of his films, mostly in the 1930s. Toland used deep focus photographic technique for most of them, whereby he could keep all objects on the screen, whether foreground or background, in sharp focus at the same time. The technique gives the illusion of depth and therefore makes the scene more true to life.\nA perfectionist, Wyler earned the nickname \"40-take Wyler\". On the set of \"Jezebel\", Wyler forced Henry Fonda through 40 takes of one particular scene, his only guidance being \"Again!\" after each take. When Fonda asked for more direction, Wyler responded, \"It stinks.\" Similarly, when Charlton Heston quizzed the director about the supposed shortcomings of his performance in \"Ben-Hur\", Wyler simply told Heston \"Be better!\" However, Heston notes that by the time a scene is done, regardless of how hard it was to do, it always came off well:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nActors' director.\nHe helped propel a number of actors to stardom, including finding and directing Audrey Hepburn in her debut starring role, \"Roman Holiday\" (1953), and directing Barbra Streisand in her debut film, \"Funny Girl\" (1968), with both actresses winning Academy Awards. Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis both won their second Oscars in Wyler films, de Havilland for \"The Heiress\" (1949) and Davis for \"Jezebel\" (1938). Davis said Wyler made her a \"far, far better actress\" than she had ever been, while Laurence Olivier, who received his first Oscar nomination for Wyler's \"Wuthering Heights\" (1939), credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen. Wyler's three Best Picture-winning films each featured a Best Actress or Actor Oscar winner \u2013 Greer Garson in \"Mrs Miniver\", Fredric March in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\", and Charlton Heston in \"Ben-Hur\". Other popular Wyler films include: \"The Westerner\" (1940) with Gary Cooper, \"The Letter\" (1940) again with Davis, \"Detective Story\" (1951) with Kirk Douglas, \"Friendly Persuasion\" (1956) with Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, \"The Big Country\" (1958) with Gregory Peck and Heston, \"The Children's Hour\" (1961) with Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner, and \"How to Steal a Million\" (1966) with Hepburn and Peter O'Toole.\nPersonal life.\nWyler was briefly married to actress Margaret Sullavan (from November 25, 1934 \u2013 March 13, 1936) and married actress Margaret \"Talli\" Tallichet on October 23, 1938. The couple remained together until his death. They had five children: Catherine, Judith, William Jr., Melanie and David. Catherine said during an interview that her mother played an important part in his career, often being his \"gatekeeper\" and his reader of scripts presented to him.\nWyler was a Freemason.\nHe fluently spoke German, Alsatian, French and English.\nDeath.\nOn July 24, 1981, Wyler gave an interview with his daughter, Catherine, for \"Directed by William Wyler\", a PBS documentary about his life and career. Three days later, he died of a heart attack. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale, California.\nLegacy.\nFourteen actors won Oscars under Wyler's direction, including Bette Davis in \"Jezebel\" (1938) and her nomination for \"The Letter\" (1940). Davis summed up their work together: \"It was \"he\" who helped me to realize my full potential as an actress. I met my match in this exceptionally creative and talented director.\"\nOther Oscar winners were Olivia de Havilland in \"The Heiress\" (1949); Audrey Hepburn in her debut film, \"Roman Holiday\" (1953); Charlton Heston in \"Ben-Hur\" (1959); and Barbra Streisand in her debut film, \"Funny Girl\" (1968).\nWyler's films garnered more awards for participating artists and actors than any other director in the history of Hollywood. He received 12 Oscar nominations for Best Director, while dozens of his collaborators and actors won Oscars or were nominated. In 1965, Wyler won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for career achievement. Eleven years later, he received the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award. In addition to his Best Picture and Best Director Oscar wins, 13 of Wyler's films earned Best Picture nominations. Other late Wyler films include \"The Children's Hour\" (1961), which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Later films included \"The Collector\" (1963), \"Funny Girl\" (1968), and his final film, \"The Liberation of L.B. Jones\" (1970).\nMany of Wyler's home movies are held by the Academy Film Archive; the archive preserved a number of them in 2017.\nHonors and awards.\nWyler is the most nominated director in Academy Awards history with twelve nominations. He won the Academy Award for Best Director on three occasions, for \"Mrs. Miniver\" (1942), \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (1946), and \"Ben-Hur\" (1959). He is tied with Frank Capra and behind John Ford, who won four Oscars in this category. He is also the only director in Academy history to direct three Best Picture-winning films (the three for which he won Best Director), and shares with Steven Spielberg the record for directing the greatest number of Best Picture nominees (thirteen).\nHe has the distinction of having directed more actors to Oscar-nominated performances than any other director in history: thirty-six. Out of these nominees, fourteen went on to win Oscars, also a record. He received the fourth AFI Life Achievement Award in 1976. Among those who thanked him for directing her in her debut film was Barbra Streisand. For his contributions to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Wyler has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street. In 1961, Wyler was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. The honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It comprises the 12 species of subfamily Psittacinae (the Afrotropical parrots) and 167 of subfamily Arinae (the New World or Neotropical parrots) including several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries. Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-yellow macaw among the New World parrots and the grey parrot among the Afrotropical parrots.\nDistribution.\nAll of the parrot species in this family are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa, the island of Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. Three parrots, one extinct and another extirpated, once inhabited the United States.\nEvolutionary history.\nThis family probably had its origin early in the Paleogene period, 66\u201323\u00a0million years ago (Mya), after the western half of Gondwana had separated into the continents of Africa and South America, before the divergence of African and New World lineages around 30\u201335\u00a0Mya. The New World parrots, and by implication Old World parrots, last shared a common ancestor with the Australian cockatoos in the family the Cacatuidae approximately 33\u00a0Mya.\nThe data place most of the diversification of psittaciformes around 40\u00a0Mya, after the separation of Australia from West Antarctica and South America. Divergence of the Psittacidae from the ancestral parrots resulted from a common radiation event from what was then West Antarctica into South America, then Africa, via late Cretaceous land bridges that survived through the Paleogene.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family Psittacidae was introduced (as Psittacea) by French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The recently revised taxonomy of the family Psittacidae, based on molecular studies, recognizes the sister clade relationship of the Old World Psittacini and New World Arini tribes of subfamily Psittacinae, which have been raised to subfamily ranking and renamed Psittacinae and Arinae. Subfamily Loriinae and the other tribes of subfamily Psittacinae are now placed in superfamily Psittacoidea of all true parrots, which includes family Psittacidae.\nThe following phylogeny shows how the family Psittacidae relates to the three other families in the order Psittaciformes. The tree is based on the work by Leo Joseph and collaborators published in 2012 but with the choice of families and the number of species in each family taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), now the International Ornithologists' Union.\nThe family contains 179 species and is divided into 37 genera. Included are four species that have become extinct in historical times: the glaucous macaw, the Carolina parakeet, the Cuban macaw and the Puerto Rican parakeet. The following cladogram is based on a phylogenetic study by Brian Smith and collaborators that was published in 2023. In the analysis the genera \"Nannopsittaca\", \"Bolborhynchus\" and \"Psilopsiagon\" were found not to be monophyletic. The number of species in each genus is taken from the IOC list.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As a popular monarchy, the Belgian monarch uses the title king/queen of the Belgians and serves as the country's head of state and commander-in-chief of the Belgian Armed Forces.\nThere have been seven Belgian monarchs since independence in 1830. The incumbent, Philippe, ascended the throne on 21 July 2013, following the abdication of his father Albert II.\nOrigins.\nWhen Belgium gained independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830, the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government. The Congress voted on the question on 22 November 1830, supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13. In February 1831, the Congress nominated Louis, Duke of Nemours, the son of the French king Louis-Philippe, but international considerations deterred Louis-Philippe from accepting the honour for his son.\nFollowing this refusal, the National Congress appointed Erasme-Louis, Baron Surlet de Chokier to be the Regent of Belgium on 25 February 1831. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, since 1826 also called \"Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\", was designated as King of the Belgians by the National Congress and swore allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of the Church of St. James on Coudenberg in Brussels on 21 July. This day has since become a national holiday for Belgium and its citizens.\nHereditary and constitutional.\nAs a hereditary constitutional monarchy system, the role and operation of Belgium's monarchy are governed by the Constitution. The royal office of King is designated solely for a descendant of the first King of the Belgians, Leopold I.\nSince he is bound by the Constitution (above all other ideological and religious considerations, political opinions and debates and economic interests) the King is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of Belgian national unity and independence. Belgium's monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing-in ceremony.\nLeopold I, Leopold II and Albert I.\nKing Leopold I was head of Foreign Affairs \"as an \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" monarch\", the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king. Leopold I quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Belgique\".\nLeopold's son, King Leopold II, is chiefly remembered for the founding and capitalization of the Congo Free State as a personal fiefdom. There was scandal when the atrocities in the Congo Free State were made public, causing the Free State to be taken over by the Belgian Government. Many Congolese were killed as a result of Leopold's policies in the Congo before the reforms of direct Belgian rule. The Free State scandal is discussed at the Museum of the Congo at Tervuren in Belgium.\nOn several occasions Leopold II publicly expressed disagreement with the ruling government (e.g. on 15 August 1887, and in 1905, against Prime Minister Auguste Beernaert) and was accused by Yvon Gouet of noncompliance with the country's parliamentary system.\nLeopold II died without surviving legitimate sons. The line now descends from his nephew and successor, Albert I of Belgium, who ruled while 90% of Belgium was overrun by the forces of Kaiser Wilhelm II and is notable for his forays into colonial rule of the Belgian Congo and later, abeyant Wilhelm, the League of Nations mandate in Ruanda-Urundi. In 1934, Albert died under mysterious circumstances as he climbed solo on the Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche-les-Dames.\nLeopold III and Baudouin.\nLouis Wodon (the of Leopold III from 1934 to 1940), thought the King's oath to the Constitution implied a royal position \"over and above the Constitution\". He compared the King to a father, the head of a family: \"Regarding the moral mission of the king, it is permissible to point to a certain analogy between his role and that of a father, or more generally, of parents in a family. The family is, of course, a legal institution as is the state. But what would a family be where everything was limited among those who compose it to simply legal relationships? In a family when one considers only legal relationships one comes very close to a breakdown in the moral ties founded on reciprocal affection without which a family would be like any other fragile association\" According to Arango, Leopold III of Belgium shared these views about the Belgian monarchy.\nIn 1991, towards the end of the reign of Baudouin, Senator Yves de Wasseige, a former member of the Belgian Constitutional Court, cited four points at which the Belgian Constitution lacks democracy:\nConstitutional, political, and historical consequences.\nThe Belgian monarchy was from the beginning a constitutional monarchy, patterned after that of the United Kingdom. Raymond Fusilier wrote the Belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the French Constitution of the Kingdom of France (1791\u20131792), the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces. \"It should be observed that all monarchies have suffered periods of change as a result of which the power of the sovereign was reduced, but for the most part those periods occurred before the development of the system of constitutional monarchy and were steps leading to its establishment.\" The characteristic evidence of this is in Great Britain where there was an evolution from the time when kings ruled through the agency of ministers to that time when ministers began to govern through the instrumentality of the Crown.\nUnlike the British constitutional system, in Belgium \"the monarchy underwent a belated evolution\" which came \"after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system\" because, in 1830\u20131831, an independent state, parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously. Hans Daalder, professor of political science at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden wrote: \"Did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision\u2014which implied that the view of the King as the Keeper of the Nation, with rights and duties of its own, retained legitimacy?\"\nFor Raymond Fusilier, the Belgian monarchy had to be placed\u2014at least in the beginning\u2014between the regimes where the king rules and those in which the king does not rule but only reigns. The Belgian monarchy is closer to the principle \"the King does not rule\", but the Belgian kings were not only \"at the head of the dignified part of the Constitution\". The Belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic, because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the King's will coincides with that of the ministers, who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government. For Francis Delp\u00e9r\u00e9e, to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the State. The Belgian historian Jean Stengers wrote that \"some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity. That is very naive. He is only a piece on the chessboard, but a piece which matters\".\nList of kings of the Belgians.\nThe monarchs of Belgium originally belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The family name was changed by Albert I in 1920, to the House of Belgium and the armorial bearings of Saxony from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were dropped from the Belgian royal coat of arms.\nIn 2019, King Phillippe codified the coats of arms of himself and those of his family through Royal Decree. The personal arms of the reigning monarch was modified to restore the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family were similarly modified. The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to their ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to Royal versions of the coat arms which removed these Saxon ties during the First World War. By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish \"to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians\". The coat of arms of Belgium remains unchanged, i.e. it does not incorporate the Saxon arms.\nSince the 2017 edition of the \"Carnet Mondain\", the title \"Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha\", along with \"of Belgium\" were again in use for all descendants of Leopold I, with the exception of King Philippe, his wife, his sister and his brother,who keep their title \"of Belgium\"; therefore, the descendants of Astrid of Belgium do not bear this title, but that of \"of Austria-Este\" from their father.\nFor completeness, the family tree should include Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968). She is the legally acknowledged half-sibling of King Philippe of Belgium, and her children are also recognised as members of the royal family. \nTitle.\nThe proper title of the Belgian monarch is \"King of the \"Belgians\"\" rather than \"King of \"Belgium\"\" as is common for other monarchies throughout Europe. The title is linked to a concept of \"popular monarchy\" as defined by Kingsley Martin in his work \"The Evolution of Popular Monarchy\", published in 1936. According to Martin, the term is meant to emphasize the bond and connection to the people of the land over the territory the state controls. His work further implies that such a monarch is \"de facto\" appointed by the people as a nominal figurehead rather than being an authoritarian ruler.\nBelgium is the only extant European monarchy in which the heir to the throne does not ascend immediately upon the death or abdication of his or her predecessor. According to Article 91 of the Belgian constitution, the heir accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The joint session has to be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch. The new Belgian monarch is required to take the Belgian constitutional oath, \"I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory,\" which is uttered in the three official languages: French, Dutch, and German.\nMembers of the Belgian royal family are often known by two names: a Dutch and a French one. For example, the current monarch is called 'Philippe' in French and 'Filip' in Dutch; the fifth King of the Belgians was 'Baudouin' in French and 'Boudewijn' in Dutch.\nIn contrast to King Philippe's title of \"King of the Belgians\", Princess Elisabeth is called \"Princess \"of Belgium\"\" as the title \"Prince of the Belgians\" does not exist. She is also Duchess of Brabant, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Belgian throne. This title precedes the title \"Princess of Belgium\".\nIn the other official language of German, monarchs are usually referred to by their French names. The same is true for English with the exception of Leopold, where the accent is removed for the purpose of simplicity.\nBecause of the First World War and the resultant strong anti-German sentiment, the family name was changed in 1920, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to \"van Belgi\u00eb, de Belgique\", or \"von Belgien\" (\"of Belgium\"), depending upon which of the country's three official languages (Dutch, French, and German) is in use. It is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by Belgium's royalty (e.g. marriage licenses). In addition to this change of name, the armorial bearings of Saxony were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms (see above). Other Coburgers from the multi-branched Saxe-Coburg family have also changed their name, such as George V, who adopted the family name of Windsor after the British royal family's place of residence. Only Simeon Sakskoburggotski kept his Saxony-Coburg family name, but he was ousted from the Bulgarian throne in 1946 at the age of nine.\nNevertheless, the Royal Decree published on 19 July and signed on 12 July 2019 by King Philip, reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in the all royal versions of the family's coat of arms. The reinstatement of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha main royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philip and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle.\nConstitutional role.\nThe Belgian monarchy symbolises and maintains a feeling of national unity by representing the country in public functions and international meetings.\nIn addition, the monarch has a number of responsibilities in the process of the formation of the Government. The procedure usually begins with the nomination of the \"Informateur\" by the monarch. After the general election the Informateur officially informs the monarch of the main political formations which may be available for governance. After this phase, the monarch can appoint another \"informateur\" or appoint a \"Formateur\", who will have the charge of forming a new government, of which he or she generally becomes the Prime Minister.\nArticle 37 of the Constitution of Belgium vests the \"federal executive power\" in the monarch. Under Section III, this power includes the appointment and dismissal of ministers, the implementation of the laws passed by the Federal Parliament, the submission of bills to the Federal Parliament and the management of international relations. The monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by Parliament. In accordance with Article 106 of the Belgian Constitution, the monarch is required to exercise his powers through the ministers. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of the responsible minister, who in doing so assumes political responsibility for the act in question. This means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the Federal Government, which is accountable to the Chamber of Representatives in accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution.\nThe monarch receives the prime minister at the Palace of Brussels at least once a week, and also regularly calls other members of the government to the palace in order to discuss political matters. During these meetings, the monarch has the right to be informed of proposed governmental policies, the right to advise, and the right to warn on any matter as the monarch sees fit. The monarch also holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties and regular members of parliament. All of these meetings are organised by the monarch's personal political cabinet which is part of the Royal Household.\nThe monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces and makes appointments to the higher positions. The names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the Ministry of Defence. The monarch's military duties are carried out with the help of the Military Household which is headed by a General office. Belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers.\nThe monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power, in accordance with the Belgian Constitution, together with the two chambers of the Federal Parliament: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. All laws passed by the Federal Parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch.\nPreviously, children of the King were entitled to a seat in the senate (Senator by right) when they were 18. This right was abolished in 2014 as part of the Sixth Belgian state reform.\nInviolability.\nArticle 88 of the Belgian Constitution provides that \"the King's person is inviolable, his ministers are responsible\". This means that the King cannot be prosecuted, arrested, or convicted of crimes, cannot be summoned to appear before a court, and is not accountable to the Federal Parliament. This inviolability was deemed incompatible, however, with Article 27 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court which states that official capacity shall not exempt a person from criminal responsibility under the statute.\nTraditions.\nThe Court still keeps some old traditions, most famous is the tradition that the Reigning King of the Belgians becomes the godfather of a seventh son and the Queen the godmother of a seventh daughter. The child is then given the name of the Sovereign and receives a gift from the palace and Burgomaster of the city.\nSimilar traditions are attached to the Russian Tsar and the President of Argentina.\nAnother tradition is the centuries-old ceremonial welcome the new king receives in the country during the Joyous Entry; this tradition apparently dates back to the Dukes of Brabant.\nPopular support.\nPopular support for the monarchy had historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia. The generally pro-monarchy Catholic Party and later Christian Social Party dominated in Flanders, while the more industrialised Wallonia had more support for the Belgian Labour Party and later Socialist Party. For example, the 1950 referendum saw Flanders voting strongly in favour of King Leopold III returning, whereas Wallonia was largely against. However, in recent decades these roles have reversed, as religiosity in Flanders has decreased and the King is seen as protecting the country against (Flemish) separatism and the country's partition.\nRoyal Household.\nThe King's Household (, , ) was reorganised in 2006, and consists of seven autonomous departments and the Court's Steering Committee. Each Head of Department is responsible for his department and is accountable to the King.\nThe following departments currently make up the King's Household:\nThe King's Chief of Cabinet is responsible for dealing with political and administrative matters and for maintaining the relations with the government, trade unions and industrial circles. In relation to the King, the Chief assists in keeping track of current events; informs regarding all aspects of Belgian life; proposes and prepares audiences; assists in preparing speeches and informs the King about developments in international affairs. The Chief of Cabinet is assisted by the Deputy and Legal Adviser, the Press Adviser and the Archivist. The incumbent Chief of Cabinet is Baron Frans Van Daele, former Chief of Cabinet of President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy.\nThe Head of the King's Military Household assists the King in fulfilling his duties in the field of defence. He informs the King about all matters of security, defence policy, the views of Belgium's main partner countries and all aspects of the Belgian Armed Forces. He organises the King's contacts with the Armed Forces, advises in the fields of scientific research and police and coordinates matters with patriotic associations and former service personnel. The Military Household is also responsible for managing the Palace's computer system. The Head of the Military Household is a general officer, currently Jef Van den Put, and is assisted by an adviser, Lieutenant-Colonel Aviator Serge Vassart. The King's Aides-de-Camp and the King's Equerries are also attached to the Military Household.\nThe King's \"aides-de-camp\" are senior officers chosen by the monarch and charged with carrying out certain tasks on his behalf, such as representing him at events. The King's Equerries are young officers who take turns preparing the King's activities, informing him about all the aspects that may be important to him and providing any other useful services such as announcing visitors. The equerry accompanies the King on his trips except for those of a strictly private nature.\nThe Intendant of the King's Civil List is responsible for managing the material, financial and human resources of the King's Household. He is assisted by the Commandant of the Royal Palaces, the Treasurer of the King's Civil List and the Civil List Adviser. The Intendant of the Civil List also advises the King in the field of energy, sciences and culture and administers the King's hunting rights. The Commandant of the Royal Palaces is mainly in charge, in close cooperation with the Chief of Protocol, of the logistic support of activities and the maintenance and cleaning of the Palaces, Castles and Residences. He is also Director of the Royal Hunts.\nThe Chief of Protocol is charged with organising the public engagements of the King and the Queen, such as audiences, receptions and official banquets at the Palace, as well as formal activities outside of the Palace. He is assisted by the Queen's Secretary, who is mainly responsible for proposing and preparing the Queen's audiences and visits.\nThe Head of the Department for Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs advises the King in the economic, social and cultural fields. He is also responsible for providing coordination between the various Households and Services and for organising and minuting the meetings of the Steering Committee. The Head of the Department for Foreign Relations informs the King of developments in international policy, assists the King from a diplomatic viewpoint on royal visits abroad and prepares the King's audiences in the international field. He is also responsible for maintaining contacts with foreign diplomatic missions. The Head of the Department of Petitions is charged with processing petitions and requests for social aid addressed the King, the Queen or other members of the royal family. He is also responsible for the analysis and coordination of royal favours and activities relating to jubilees, and advises the King in the fields for which he is responsible.\nFor the personal protection of the King and the royal family, as well as for the surveillance of the royal estates, the Belgian Federal Police at all times provides a security detail to the Royal Palace, commanded by a chief police commissioner. The other members of the royal family have a service at their disposal.\nRoyal family.\nMembers of the Belgian royal family, other than the monarch, hold the title of Prince or Princess of Belgium, with the style of Royal Highness. Prior to the First World War, they used the additional titles of Prince or Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke or Duchess of Saxony, as members of the House of Wettin.\nThe title Prince or Princess of Belgium is a specific noble title within the Belgian nobility reserved for members of the Belgian royal family. Originally the Royal Decree of 14 March 1891 reserved this title for all persons descending in the direct male line from king Leopold I. The royal decree also automatically granted the title to the princesses who joined the Belgian royal family by their marriage to a Prince of Belgium. This royal decree was amended by the Royal Decree of 2 December 1991, which reserved the title for the direct male and female descendants of Albert II and abolished the Salic Law with regards to its granting. The Royal Decree of 12 November 2015, published in the Belgian official journal on 24 November 2015, abolished the aforementioned Royal Decree of 1991, and restricts new grants of this title to the children and grandchildren of the reigning monarch, and to the children and grandchildren of the crown prince(ss). The spouse of a Prince or Princess of Belgium is no longer automatically granted the title but he or she can still be granted the title by royal decree on an individual basis. Prior to this, all descendants of Albert II were entitled to the title of prince or princess.\nKing Philippe (born 15 April 1960) is King of the Belgians. He married, on 4 December 1999, \"Jonkvrouwe\" Mathilde d'Udekem d'Acoz, who was created Princess Mathilde of Belgium a day before their wedding, after which she also took the title Duchess of Brabant as the wife of the Duke of Brabant, and became, from 21 July 2013, Queen Mathilde of the Belgians. She is a daughter of Patrick d'Udekem d'Acoz (made a count prior to the wedding) and his wife, Countess Anna Maria Komorowska. They have four children:\nOther descendants of Leopold III.\nSource:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62277", "revid": "50236799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62277", "title": "Ben Hecht", "text": "American writer, director, and producer (1894\u20131964)\nBen Hecht (; February 28, 1894 \u2013 April 18, 1964) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, playwright, journalist, and novelist. A journalist in his youth, he went on to write 35 books and some of the most enjoyed screenplays and plays in America. He received screen credits, alone or in collaboration, for the stories or screenplays of some seventy films, including six Academy Award nominations and two wins.\nAfter graduating from high school in 1910, Hecht ran away to Chicago, where, in his own words, he \"haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops.\" In the 1910s and 1920s, Hecht became a noted journalist, foreign correspondent, and literary figure. In the late 1920s, his co-authored, reporter-themed play, \"The Front Page\", became a Broadway hit.\nThe \"Dictionary of Literary Biography \u2013 American Screenwriters\" calls him \"one of the most successful screenwriters in the history of motion pictures\". Hecht received the first Academy Award for Best Story for \"Underworld\" (1927). Many of the screenplays he worked on are now considered classics. He also provided story ideas for such films as \"Stagecoach\" (1939). Film historian Richard Corliss called him \"\"the\" Hollywood screenwriter\", someone who \"personified Hollywood itself\". In 1940, he wrote, produced, and directed \"Angels Over Broadway\", which was nominated for Best Screenplay. \nHecht became an active Zionist after meeting Peter Bergson, who came to the United States near the start of World War II. Motivated by what became the Holocaust Hecht wrote articles and plays, such as \"We Will Never Die\" in 1943 and \"A Flag is Born\" in 1946. Thereafter, he wrote many screenplays anonymously to avoid a British boycott of his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The boycott was a response to Hecht's active support of paramilitary action against British Mandate for Palestine forces, during which time a Zionist force's supply ship to Palestine was named the S.S.\u00a0\"Ben\u00a0Hecht\" ()().\nIn 1954, Hecht published his highly regarded autobiography, \"A Child of the Century\". According to it, he did not hold screenwriting (in contrast to journalism) in high esteem, and never spent more than eight weeks on a script. In 1983, 19 years after his death, Ben Hecht was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nHecht was born in New York City, the son of Russian-Jewish immigrants Joseph Hecht, a worker in the garment industry, and his wife Sarah (n\u00e9e\u00a0Swernofsky). The couple was from Minsk, Russian Empire, and had married in 1892.\nThe family moved to Racine, Wisconsin, where Ben attended high school. For his bar mitzvah, his parents bought him four crates full of the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Twain. When Hecht was in his early teens, he would spend the summers with an uncle in Chicago. On the road much of the time, his father did not have much effect on Hecht's childhood, and his mother was busy managing a store in downtown Racine. Film author Scott Siegal wrote, \"He was considered a child prodigy at age ten, seemingly on his way to a career as a concert violinist, but two years later was performing as a circus acrobat\".\nAfter graduating from Racine High School in 1910, Hecht attended the University of Wisconsin for three days before leaving for Chicago at the age of 16 or 17. He lived with relatives and started a career in journalism. He won a job with the \"Chicago Daily Journal\" after writing a profane poem for publisher John C. Eastman to entertain guests at a party. By age seventeen Hecht was a full-time reporter, first with the \"Daily Journal\", and later with the \"Chicago Daily News\". In the aftermath of World War I, Hecht was sent to cover Berlin for the \"Daily News\". While there, he also wrote his first and most successful novel, \"Erik Dorn\" (1921). It was a sensational debut for Hecht as a serious writer.\nThe 1969 movie, \"Gaily, Gaily\", directed by Norman Jewison and starring Beau Bridges as \"Ben Harvey\", was based on Hecht's life during his early years working as a reporter in Chicago. The film was nominated for three Oscars. The story was taken from a portion of his autobiography, \"A Child of the Century\". It was also from his 1963 book \"Gaily, Gaily\".\nWriting career.\nJournalist.\nFrom 1918 to 1919, Hecht served as war correspondent in Berlin for the \"Chicago Daily News\". According to Barbara and Scott Siegel, \"Besides being a war reporter, he was noted for being a tough crime reporter while also becoming known in Chicago literary circles\".\nIn 1921, Hecht inaugurated a \"Daily News\" column, \"One Thousand and One Afternoons in Chicago\". While it lasted, the column was enormously influential. His editor, Henry Justin Smith, later said it represented a new concept in journalism: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhile at the \"Chicago Daily News\", Hecht famously broke the 1921 \"Ragged Stranger Murder Case\" story, about the murder of war hero Carl Wanderer's wife, which led to Wanderer's trial and execution. In Chicago, he also met and befriended Maxwell Bodenheim, an American poet and novelist, later known as the King of Greenwich Village Bohemians, and with whom he became a lifelong friend.\nAfter concluding \"One Thousand and One Afternoons\", Hecht went on to produce novels, plays, screenplays, and memoirs, but for him, none of these eclipsed his early success in finding the stuff of literature in city life. Recalling that period, Hecht wrote, \"I haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops. I ran everywhere in the city like a fly buzzing in the works of a clock, tasted more than any fit belly could hold, learned not to sleep, and buried myself in a tick-tock of whirling hours that still echo in me\".\nNovelist and short-story writer.\nBesides working as reporter in Chicago, Hecht also contributed short stories to literary magazines, including his friend, Margaret C. Anderson's, \"Little Review\". His reporting on revolutionary movements from Berlin after World War I, his first novel, \"Erik Dorn\" (1921) drawn from that experience, and his daily column \"1001 Afternoons in Chicago\", later collected into a book, enhanced his reputation in the literary scene. After leaving the \"News\" in 1923, he started his own newspaper, The \"Chicago Literary Times\".\nAccording to biographer Eddy Applegate, \"Hecht read voraciously the works of Gautier, Baudelaire, Mallarm\u00e9, and Verlaine, and developed a style that was extraordinary and imaginative. The use of metaphor, imagery, and vivid phrases made his writing distinct\u00a0... again and again Hecht showed an uncanny ability to picture the strange jumble of events in strokes as vivid and touching as the brushmarks of a novelist\".\n\"Ben Hecht was the enfant terrible of American letters in the first half of the twentieth century\", wrote author Sanford Sternlicht in 2004. \"If Hecht was consistently opposed to anything, it was to censorship of literature, art, and film by either the government or self-appointed guardians of public morality\". He adds, \"Even though he never attended college, Hecht became a successful novelist, playwright, journalist, and screenwriter. His star has sunk below the horizon now, but in his own lifetime Hecht became one of the most famous American literary and entertainment figures\".\nEventually Hecht became associated with the writers Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, Maxwell Bodenheim, Carl Sandburg, and Pascal Covici. He knew Margaret Anderson, and contributed to her \"Little Review\", the magazine of the Chicago \"literary renaissance\", and to \"Smart Set\".\nIn 1954, Hecht published his autobiography, \"A Child of the Century\", which, according to literary critic Robert Schmuhl, \"received such extensive critical acclaim that his literary reputation improved markedly during the last decade of his life\u00a0... Hecht's vibrant and candid memoir of more than six hundred pages restored him to the stature of a serious and significant American writer\". Novelist Saul Bellow reviewed the book for \"The New York Times\": \"His manners are not always nice, but then nice manners do not always make interesting autobiographies, and this autobiography has the merit of being intensely interesting\u00a0... If he is occasionally slick, he is also independent, forthright, and original. Among the pussycats who write of social issues today, he roars like an old-fashioned lion.\" In 2011, Richard Corliss, announced the \"Time\" editorial board named Hecht's autobiography to the \"Time\" 100 best non-fiction books list (books published since the founding of the magazine in 1923).\n\"New Yorker\" film critic David Denby begins a discussion of Hecht's screenwriting by recounting a long story from his autobiography. He then asks, \"How many of these details are true? It's impossible to say, but truth, in this case, may not be the point. As Norman Mailer noted in 1973, Hecht 'was never a writer to tell the truth when a concoction could put life in his prose.'\" Denby calls this Hecht's \"gift for confabulated anecdote\". Near the end of the article, Denby returns to \"A Child of the Century\", \"that vast compendium of period evocation, juiced anecdotes, and dubious philosophy\".\nBesides working on novels and short stories, he has been credited with ghostwriting books, including Marilyn Monroe's autobiography \"My Story\". \"The reprint of Marilyn Monroe's memoir, \"My Story\", in 2000, by Cooper Square Press, correctly credits Hecht as an author, ending a period of almost fifty years in which Hecht's role was denied\u00a0... Hecht himself, however, kept denying it publicly\".\nAccording to her biographer, Sarah Churchwell, Monroe was \"persuaded to capitalize on her newfound celebrity by beginning an autobiography. It was born out of a collaboration with journalist and screenwriter Ben Hecht, hired as a ghostwriter\". Churchwell adds that the facts in her story were highly selective. \"Hecht reported to his editor during the interviews that he was sometimes sure Marilyn was fabricating. He explained, 'When I say lying, I mean she isn't telling the truth. I don't think so much that she is trying to deceive me as that she is a fantasizer.'\"\nPlaywright.\nBeginning with a series of one-acts in 1914, he began writing plays. His first full-length play was \"The Egotist\", and it was produced in New York in 1922. While living in Chicago, he met fellow reporter Charles MacArthur and together they moved to New York to collaborate on their Chicago-crime-reporter themed play, \"The Front Page\". It was widely acclaimed and had a successful run on Broadway of 281 performances, beginning August 1928. In 1931, it was turned into a successful film, which was nominated for three Oscars.\nScreenwriter.\nFilm historian Richard Corliss writes, \"Ben Hecht was \"the\" Hollywood screenwriter\u00a0... [and] it can be said without too much exaggeration that Hecht personifies Hollywood itself.\" Movie columnist Pauline Kael says, \"between them, Hecht and Jules Furthman wrote most of the best American talkies\". Eddie Muller stated that \"Ben Hecht's fingerprints are all over some of Hollywood's greatest movies, including early prototypes of what would become film noir.\" His movie career can be defined by about twenty credited screenplays he wrote for Hawks, Hitchcock, Hathaway, Lubitsch, Wellman, Sternberg, and himself. He wrote many of those with his two regular collaborators, Charles MacArthur and Charles Lederer.\nWhile living in New York in 1926, he received a telegram from screenwriter friend Herman J. Mankiewicz, who had recently moved to Los Angeles. \"Will you accept three hundred per week to work for Paramount Pictures. All expenses paid. The three hundred is peanuts. Millions are to be grabbed out here, and your only competition is idiots\", it read. \"Don't let this get around.\" As a writer in need of money, he traveled to Hollywood as Mankiewicz suggested. In the film \"The Front Page,\" when the sheriff asks who threw a bucket out the window, Walter Catlett's character replies, \"Judge Mankiewicz threw it,\" a nod to Hecht's friend.\nHe arrived in Los Angeles and began his career at the beginning of the sound era by writing the story for Josef von Sternberg's gangster movie \"Underworld\" in 1927. For that first screenplay and story, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in Hollywood's first Academy award ceremony. Soon afterward, he became the \"most prolific and highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood\".\nHecht spent from two to twelve weeks in Hollywood each year, \"during which he earned enough money (his record was $100,000 in one month, for two screenplays) to live on for the rest of the year in New York, where he did what he considered his serious writing\", writes film historian Carol Easton. Nonetheless, later in his career, \"he was a writer who liked to think that his genius had been stifled by Hollywood and by its dreadful habit of giving him so much money\". He wrote that \"there is something about the way they (films) are made and the way they disappear that gives you... the feeling that you are mysteriously wasting your time\u2014and not using your real talents.\"\nYet his income was as much a result of his skill as a writer as well as his early jobs with newspapers. As film historians Mast and Kawin wrote, \"The newspaper reporters often seemed like gangsters who had accidentally ended up behind a typewriter rather than a tommy gun; they talked and acted as rough as the crooks their assignments forced them to cover\u00a0... It is no accident that Ben Hecht, the greatest screenwriter of rapid-fire, flavorful tough talk, as well as a major comic playwright, wrote gangster pictures, prison pictures, and newspaper pictures.\"\nHecht became one of Hollywood's most prolific screenwriters, able to write a full screenplay in two to eight weeks. According to Samuel Goldwyn biographer, Carol Easton, in 1931, with his writing partner Charles MacArthur, he \"knocked out \"The Unholy Garden\" in twelve hours. Hecht subsequently received a fan letter from producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr.:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;After reading your magnificent script, Mr. Goldwyn and I both wish to go on record with the statement that if \"The Unholy Garden\" isn't the finest motion picture Samuel Goldwyn has ever produced, the fault will be entirely ours. You have done your part superbly.\nIt was produced exactly as written, and 'became one of the biggest, yet funniest, bombs ever made by a studio'.\"\nDespite his monetary success, however, Hecht always kept Hollywood at arms' length. According to film historian Gregory Black, \"he did not consider his work for the movies serious art; it was more a means of replenishing his bank account. When his work was finished, he retreated to New York.\"\nAt least part of the reason for this was due to the industry's system of censorship. Black writes, \"as Mankiewicz, Selznick, and Hecht knew all too well, much of the blame for the failure of the movies to deal more frankly and honestly with life, lay with a rigid censorship imposed on the industry\u00a0... [and] on the content of films during its golden era of studio production.\" Because the costs of production and distribution were so high, the primary \"goal of the studios was profit, not art\u00a0... [and] fearful of losing any segment of their audiences, the studios either carefully avoided controversial topics or presented them in a way that evaded larger issues\", thereby creating only \"harmless entertainment\".\nAccording to historian David Thomson, \"to their own minds, Herman Mankiewicz and Ben Hecht both died morose and frustrated. Neither of them had written the great books they believed possible.\"\nIn an interview with director Howard Hawks, with whom Hecht worked on many films, Scott Breivold elicited comments on the way they often worked:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Breivold. Could you explain how the day-to-day writing goes on a script?\nHawks. Well, when Hecht and MacArthur and I used to work on a script, we'd sit in a room and work for two hours and then we'd play backgammon for an hour. Then we'd start again and one of us would be one character and one would be another character. We'd read our lines of dialogue and the whole idea was to try to stump the other people, to see if they could think of something crazier than you could.\nAccording to film historian Virginia Wexman,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;David Selznick had a flair for the dramatic, and no one knew that better than Ben Hecht. The two collaborated on some of Hollywood's biggest hits \u2013 movies like \"Gone With the Wind\" and \"Notorious\" and \"Duel in the Sun\" \u2013 and often enough, the making of those films was as rife with conflict as the films themselves\n\"Nothing Sacred\" is probably the \"most famous of all the Carole Lombard films next to \"My Man Godfrey\"\", wrote movie historian James Harvey. And it impressed people at the time with its evident ambition \"and Selznick determined to make the classiest of all screwball comedies, turned to Lombard as a necessity, but also to Ben Hecht, nearly the hottest screenwriter in Hollywood at the time, especially for comedy.\u00a0... it was also the first screwball comedy to lay apparent claim to larger satiric meanings, to make scathing observations about American life and society.\"\nIn an interview with Irene Selznick, ex-wife of producer David O. Selznick, she discussed the other leading screenwriters of that time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They all aspired to be Ben. The resourcefulness of his mind, his vitality were so enormous. His knowledge. His talent and ambition. He could tear through things, and he tore through life. They'd see this prodigious output of Ben's, and they'd think, \"Oh, hell, I'm a bum.\" I think it must have been devastating. Ben did it to MacArthur, who died in time to save his reputation. And I'd hate to have been Herman [Mankiewicz], caught between Kaufman and Hecht.\nAccording to James Harvey, Ernst Lubitsch felt uneasy in the world of playwright No\u00ebl Coward.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"If Coward could write his play for three particular actors, he reasoned to an interviewer, why couldn't it be rewritten for three others? It was at this point\u00a0... that he turned to Ben Hecht\u00a0... to work with him on the screenplay for \"Design for Living\".\" It was the only Lubitsch-Hecht collaboration. Harvey adds, \"Though Lubitsch must have been reassured by Hecht's taking the job. No writer in Hollywood had better credentials in the tough, slangy, specifically American style that Lubitsch wanted to impart to the Coward play. And together, they transformed it.\"\nStyles of writing.\nAccording to Siegel, \"The talkie era put writers like Hecht at a premium because they could write dialogue in the quirky, idiosyncratic style of the common man. Hecht, in particular, was wonderful with slang, and he peppered his films with the argot of the streets. He also had a lively sense of humor and an uncanny ability to ground even the most outrageous stories successfully with credible, fast-paced plots.\" Hecht, his friend Budd Schulberg wrote many years ago, \"seemed the personification of the writer at the top of his game, the top of his world, not gnawing at doubting himself as great writers were said to do, but with every word and every gesture indicating the animal pleasure he took in writing well\".\n\"Movies\", Hecht was to recall, \"were seldom written. In 1927, they were yelled into existence in conferences that kept going in saloons, brothels, and all-night poker games. Movie sets roared with arguments and organ music.\"\nHe was best known for two specific and contrasting types of film: crime thrillers and screwball comedies. Among crime thrillers, Hecht was responsible for such films as \"The Unholy Night\" (1929), the classic \"Scarface\" (1932), and Hitchcock's \"Notorious\". Among his comedies, there were \"The Front Page\", which led to many remakes, No\u00ebl Coward's \"Design for Living\" (1933), \"Twentieth Century\", \"Nothing Sacred\", and Howard Hawks's \"Monkey Business\" (1952).\nFilm historian Richard Corliss wrote, \"it is his crisp, frenetic, sensational prose and dialogue style that elevates his work above that of the dozens of other reporters who streamed west to cover and exploit Hollywood's biggest 'story': the talkie revolution.\"\nNotable screenplays.\n\"Underworld\" was the story of a petty hoodlum with political pull; it was based on a real Chicago gangster Hecht knew. \"The film began the gangster film genre that became popular in the early 1930s.\". It and \"Scarface\" were \"the alpha and omega of Hollywood's first gangster craze\". In it, he \"manages both to congratulate journalism for its importance and to chastise it for its chicanery, by underlining the newspapers' complicity in promoting the underworld image\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Like so many of his films, \"Underworld\" and \"Scarface\" are \"stories\" that ace-reporter Hecht loved to cover, as much for the larger-than-life qualities of his headliners as for the enormity of their crimes. Love-hate\u00a0... fascination-revulsion\u00a0... expos\u00e9-glorification\u00a0... these are the polarities that make Hecht's best films deliciously ambiguous.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hecht's introduction, which is nothing if not moody and Sandburgian, describes \"A great city in the dead of night \u2013 streets lonely, moon-flooded \u2013 buildings empty as the cliff-dwellings of a forgotten age.\"\nHecht was noted for confronting producers and directors when he wasn't satisfied with the way they used his scripts. For this film, at one point he demanded that its director, Josef von Sternberg, remove his name from the credits since Sternberg unilaterally changed one scene. Afterward, however, he relented and took credit for the film's story, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay \u2013 the first year the awards were presented.\nAfter contributing to the original stories for a number of films, he worked without credit on the first film version of his original 1928 play \"The Front Page\". It was produced by Howard Hughes and directed by Lewis Milestone in 1931. James Harvey writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;it is Hecht and MacArthur's Chicago\u00a0... that counts most deeply in the imagination of Hollywood. And their play, the first of the great newspaper comedies, did more to define the tone and style, the look and the sound of Hollywood comedy than any other work of its time.\nOf the original play, theater producer and writer Jed Harris writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;here is a play which reflects miraculously the real as well as the literary personalities of the playwrights. Every line of it glows with a demoniacal humor, sordid, insolent, and mischievous to the point of downright perversity, in which one instantly recognizes the heroic comic spirit of its authors\u00a0... Both Hecht and MacArthur owe their literary origins to the newspapers of Chicago. Famous crime reporters, their talents were first cradled in the recounting of great exploits in arson, rape, murder, gang war, and municipal politics. Out of a welter of jailbreaks, hangings, floods, and whore-house raidings, they have gathered the rich, savory characters who disport themselves on the stage to Times Square Theatre.\nEddie Muller observed that \"Hecht and MacArthur's ribald rat-a-tat dialogue... instantly created a new American archetype\u2014the fast-talking, hard-drinking newshound who'll do anything for a scoop.\"\nAfter ushering in the beginning of the gangster films with \"Underworld\", his next film became one of the best films of that genre. \"Scarface\" was directed by Howard Hawks, with \"Hecht the wordsmith and Hawks the engineer\", who became \"one of the few directors with whom Hecht enjoyed working\". It starred Paul Muni playing the role of an Al Capone-like gangster. \"\"Scarface's\" all-but-suffocating vitality is a kind of cinematic version of tabloid prose at its best.\"\nThe story of how \"Scarface\" came to be written represents Hecht's writing style in those days. Film historian Max Wilk interviewed Leyland Hayward, an independent literary agent, who, in 1931, managed to convince Hecht that a young oil tycoon in Texas named Howard Hughes wanted him to write the screenplay to his first book. Hayward wrote about that period:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;So I went back to Hughes, and told him I'd been able to persuade Hecht to do his script; I told him Ben's terms, \u2013 $1,000 per day \u2013 and Howard didn't blink an eye. He nodded, and said, 'Okay-it's a deal. But you tell Hecht I want a real tough shoot-'em-up script that'll knock the audience out of its seats, okay?'\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"So Ben went to work\", added Hayward. Hayward was to receive 10% of Hecht's fees as his commission. \"He was a hell of a fast writer \u2013 sometimes too fast. I didn't even know how fast he could go\u00a0... At the end of the first day, I went back to Ben's house. There he was, typing away\u00a0... I said, 'Ben \u2013 please slow down.' Over the next few days, 'while watching the accumulated pages of Hecht's script growing higher and higher, 'I couldn't slow the guy down!', sighed Hayward, who only made his commission for each day Hecht worked.\nI came by his home the next day\u00a0... 'I've got an idea. I'm going to finish this damn thing tomorrow', Ben told me. 'Ben\u2014for God's sake!', I said. 'Can't you slow down a little? Hughes isn't interested in you setting some sort of a speed record for writing!'\nBut it was as if young Hayward had set out to flag down an army tank. Nothing stopped Hecht. On the night of the ninth day, Hayward arrived with his daily payment from Hughes, to find Hecht lounging in a chair, enjoying a highball.\nHecht waved at his stack of manuscript. 'Done', he announced. 'Finished the damn thing'.\nNine thousand dollars \u2013 for the screenplay of \"Scarface?\" sighed Hayward.\u00a0... Hughes was tickled with Ben's script; he showed it to Howard Hawks. Hawks loved it, and then they picked up this wonderful young actor from New York, Paul Muni, to play the lead. The picture went out and cleaned up \u2013 made a bundle for Hughes\u00a0... And if old Ben really outsmarted himself on that one\u00a0... he didn't care. He was on to something else. Ben was always on to something else.\"\nFor his next film, \"Twentieth Century\", he wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Charles MacArthur as an adaptation of their original play from 1932. It was directed by Howard Hawks, and starred John Barrymore and Carole Lombard. It is a comedy about a Broadway producer who was losing his leading lady to the seductive Hollywood film industry, and will do anything to win her back.\nIt is \"a fast-paced, witty film that contains the rapid-fire dialogue for which Hecht became famous. It is one of the first, and finest, of the screwball comedies of the 1930s.\"\nThis was the story about Mexican rebel, Pancho Villa, who takes to the hills after killing an overseer in revenge for his father's death. It was directed by Howard Hawks and starred Wallace Beery. Although the movie took liberties with the facts, it became a great success, and Hecht received an Academy Award nomination for his screenplay adaptation.\nIn a letter from the film's producer, David O. Selznick, to studio head Louis B. Mayer, Selznick discussed the need for a script rewrite:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have arranged with Ben Hecht to do the final script of \"Viva Villa!\"\u00a0... On the quality, we are protected not merely by Hecht's ability, but by the clause that the work must be to my satisfaction. It may seem like a short space of time for a man to do a complete new script, but Hecht is famous for his speed, and did the entire job on \"Scarface\" in eleven days.\n\"Barbary Coast\" was also directed by Howard Hawks and starred Miriam Hopkins and Edward G. Robinson. The film takes place in late nineteenth century San Francisco with Hopkins playing the role of a dance-hall girl up against Robinson, who runs the town.\nHecht and Macarthur left Hollywood and went back to New York where they wrote produced and co-directed \"The Scoundrel\" marking the American film debut of No\u00ebl Coward. Reminiscent of Molnar's \"Liliom\", the movie won the Academy Award for Best Original Story.\n\"Nothing Sacred\" became Hecht's first project after he and Charles MacArthur closed their failing film company, which they started in 1934. The film was adapted from his play, \"Hazel Flagg\", and starred Carole Lombard as a small-town girl diagnosed with radium poisoning. \"A reporter makes her case a cause for his newspaper.\" The story \"allowed Hecht to work with one of his favorite themes, hypocrisy (especially among journalists); he took the themes of lying, decadence, and immorality, and made them into a sophisticated screwball comedy\".\n\"Gunga Din\" was co-written with Charles MacArthur, and became \"one of Hollywood's greatest action-adventure films\". The screenplay was based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling, directed by George Stevens and starred Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. In 1999, the film was deemed \"culturally significant\" by the United States Library of Congress.\nAfter working without credit on \"Gone with the Wind\" in 1939, he co-wrote (with Charles MacArthur) an adaptation of Emily Bront\u00eb's novel, \"Wuthering Heights\". Although the screenplay was cut off at the story's half-way point, as it was considered too long, it was nominated for an Academy Award.\nMovie historian James Harvey notes that in some respects \"It's a Wonderful World\" is an even more accomplished film \u2013 the comedy counterpart to the supremely assured and high-spirited work Van Dyke had accomplished with \"San Francisco\" (1936). \"Ben Hecht, another speed specialist, wrote the screenplay (from a story by Hecht and Herman Mankiewicz); it's in his \"Front Page\" vein, with admixtures of \"It Happened One Night\" and \"Bringing Up Baby\", as well as surprising adumbrations of the nineteen-forties private-eye film.\"\n\"Angels Over Broadway\" was one of only two movies he directed, produced, and wrote originally for film, the other was \"Specter of the Rose\" (1946). Angels Over Broadway was considered \"one of his most personal works\". It starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Rita Hayworth and was nominated for an Academy Award. \"The dialogue as well as the script's descriptive passages are chock full of brittle Hechtian similes that sparkle on the page, but turn leaden when delivered. Hecht was an endlessly articulate raconteur. In his novels and memoirs, articulation dominates\".\nIn the script, he experimented with \"reflections of life \u2013 as if a ghost were drifting in the rain\". These \"reflections\" of sidewalks, bridges, glass, and neon make the film a visual prototype of the nineteen-forties \"film noir\".\nFor Alfred Hitchcock he wrote a number of his best psycho-dramas and received his final Academy Award nomination for \"Notorious\". He also worked without credit on Hitchcock's next two films, \"The Paradine Case\" (1947) and \"Rope\" (1948). \"Spellbound\", the first time Hitchcock worked with Hecht, is notable for being one of the first Hollywood movies to deal seriously with the subject of psychoanalysis.\nIn 1947, he teamed up with Charles Lederer, and co-wrote three films: \"Her Husband's Affairs\", \"Kiss of Death\", and \"Ride the Pink Horse\". In 1950, he co-wrote \"The Thing\" without credit. They again teamed up to write the 1952 screwball comedy, \"Monkey Business\", which became Hecht's last true success as a screenwriter.\nUncredited films.\nAmong the better-known films he helped write without being credited are \"Gone with the Wind\", \"The Shop Around the Corner\", 'Foreign Correspondent', \"His Girl Friday\" (the second film version of his play \"The Front Page\"), \"The Sun Also Rises\", \"Mutiny on the Bounty\", \"Casino Royale\" (1967), and \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". According to Edward White, Hecht's last minute script rewrite for \"Gone with the Wind\" (Hecht had never read the novel), likely saved it from box office disaster, lending credence to Hecht's nickname as the \"Shakespeare of Hollywood\", even though Hecht saw it as an example of how bad Hollywood's movies really are.\nOften, the only evidence of Hecht's involvement in a movie screenplay has come from letters.\nThe following are snippets of letters discussing \"The Sun Also Rises\", based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway:\nLetter by David O. Selznick to Hecht, December 19, 1956:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;My present feeling is that eighty percent of the script is eighty per cent right, and that twenty per cent of it is eighty per cent wrong. That's pretty damn good, considering the time we spent on it, even though it was twice as long as you normally spend. So let's really try to do a job that will be\u00a0... something that we can be proud of for many years to come\u00a0...\nLetter by Selznick to John Huston, April 3, 1957:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is certainly not demeaning your talent to say that I don't think there is anybody alive who can come in on a job at the last minute and revise, \"without serious danger\", work to which two old hands like Ben and myself have devoted many, many months of most careful work and devoted effort\u00a0... it is also true that I have never seen Ben or anyone else bring to a job more thorough analysis, more willingness to rewrite, than he has.\nThe following letter discusses \"Portrait of Jennie\" (1948):\nLetter by Selznick to Hecht, November 24, 1948:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dear Ben: Very many thanks in advance for coming to the rescue again\u00a0... the audience was enchanted\u00a0... and it set the mood beautifully for the picture\u00a0... It needs the type of cinematic forward journalese of which you are the only master I know\u00a0... In any event, I shall be eagerly awaiting your redraft, which can take an entirely different form\u00a0... either actual or Hechtian creations\nFor original screenplay writer Sidney Howard, film historian Joanne Yeck writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;reducing the intricacies of \"Gone with the Wind\"'s epic dimensions was a herculean task\u00a0... and Howard's first submission was far too long, and would have required at least six hours of film;\u00a0... [producer] Selznick wanted Howard to remain on the set to make revisions\u00a0... but Howard refused to leave New England, [and] as a result, revisions were handled by a host of local writers, including Ben Hecht\nProducer David O. Selznick replaced the film's director three weeks into filming and then had the script rewritten. He sought out director Victor Fleming, who, at the time, was directing \"The Wizard of Oz\". Fleming was dissatisfied with the script, so Selznick brought in famed writer Ben Hecht to rewrite the entire screenplay within five days.\nHecht was not credited, however, for his contribution, and Sidney Howard received the Academy Award for Best Screenplay.\nIn a letter from Selznick to film editor O'Shea [October 19, 1939], Selznick discussed how the writing credits should appear, taking into consideration that Sidney Howard had died a few months earlier after a farm-tractor accident at his home in Massachusetts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To Mr. O'Shea: Some time ago, it was my intention to have, in addition to the Sidney Howard credit on \"Gone With the Wind\", a list of contributing writers. I would rather now abandon this idea, first because, while it is true that Sidney Howard did only a portion of the script\u00a0... [but] because I don't want to deprive Sidney Howard, and more particularly his widow, of any of the glory that may be attendant upon his last job.\nIn a letter [September 25, 1939] from Selznick to Hecht, regarding writing introductory sequences and titles, which were used to set the scene and condense the narrative throughout the movie, Selznick wrote,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Dear Ben: There are only seven titles needed for \"Gone With the Wind\" and I am certain you could bat them out in a few minutes, especially since a few of them can be based on titles you wrote while you were here. Will you do these for me in accordance with your promise?\u00a0... Very anxious to get picture into laboratory at once and would appreciate it if you could tackle them immediately upon their receipt\n\"\"His Girl Friday\" remains not just the fastest-talking romantic comedy ever made, but a very tricky inquiry into love's need for a chase (or a dream) and the sharpest pointer to uncertain gender roles.\"\nThe \"D.C. Examiner\" writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Director Howard Hawks' 1940 classic \"His Girl Friday\" is not just one of the funniest screwball comedies ever made, it is also one of the finest film adaptations of a stage play. \"Hawks took Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's Broadway hit \"The Front Page\", the best play about newspapers ever written, and, by changing the gender of a major character, turned it into a romantic comedy. The new script was by Hecht (uncredited) and Charles Lederer.\nHecht wrote the first screenplay for Ian Fleming's first novel, \"Casino Royale\". Although the final screenplay and film was made into a comedy spoof, Hecht's version was written as a straight Bond adventure, states spy novelist Jeremy Duns, who recently discovered the original lost scripts. According to Duns, Hecht's version included elements hard to imagine in a film adaptation, adding that \"these drafts are a master-class in thriller-writing, from the man who arguably perfected the form with \"Notorious\".\" Hecht wrote that he has \"never had more fun writing a movie\", and felt the James Bond character was cinema's first \"gentleman superman\" in a long time, as opposed to Hammett and Chandler's \"roughneck supermen\".\nHecht died few days before the final screenplay was announced to the press.\nDuns compares Hecht's unpublished screenplay with the final rewritten film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;All the pages in Hecht's papers are gripping, but the material from April 1964 is phenomenal, and it's easy to imagine it as the basis for a classic Bond adventure. Hecht's treatment of the romance element is powerful and convincing, even with the throwaway ending, but there is also a distinctly adult feel to the story. It has all the excitement and glamour you would expect from a Bond film, but is more suspenseful, and the violence is brutal rather than cartoonish.\nPersonal life.\nHecht married Marie Armstrong (1892\u20131956), a gentile, in 1915, when he was 21, and they had a daughter, Edwina (1916\u20131991), who would grow up to be an actress. He later met Rose Caylor, a writer, and together they left Chicago (and his family) in 1924, moving to New York. He was divorced from Armstrong in 1925. He married Caylor that same year, and they remained married until Hecht's death in 1964.\nOn July 30, 1943, Ben and Rose had a daughter, Jenny Hecht, who became an actress at the age of 8. She died of a drug overdose on March 25, 1971, at the age of 27, shortly after completing her third movie appearance. A play about Jenny's brief life, \"The Screenwriter's Daughter\" by Larry Mollin, was staged in London in October 2015.\nActivism.\nCivil rights.\nAccording to Hecht historian Florice Whyte Kovan, he became active in promoting civil rights early in his career.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;in the early 1920s, Hecht organized campaigns against the Ku Klux Klan, whose lynchings of minorities, primarily blacks, terrorized the American South and North\u00a0... Artists and writers joined the effort, blending civil rights into the arts and literary scene\u00a0...\nHecht wrote enough stories about black-white dynamics to form a small collection, including \"To Bert Williams\", a richly symbolic obituary to the eminent vaudevillian, the thought-provoking \"The Miracle\"\u00a0... In the same period, circa May\u2013June 1923, Hecht\u00a0... collaborated on a musical with Dave Payton (Peyton), jazz pianist and music critic for the black newspaper the \"Chicago Defender\"\u00a0... He broke taboos by publishing a regular column, Black-belt Shadows, about Chicago and broader AfroAmerica by young William Moore \u2013 with the then-daring editorial note: \"This column is conducted by a Negro journalist\". A factor in his willingness to work with blacks on occasion was his first playwriting experience: his collaborator was a young black student.\nHecht film stories featuring black characters included \"Hallelujah, I'm a Bum\", co-starring Edgar Conner as Al Jolson's sidekick in a politically savvy, rhymed dialogue over Richard Rodgers music. Jolson, a noted blackface performer and star of \"The Jazz Singer\", was also active in promoting racial equality on the Broadway stage.\nHecht's most important race film historically was the Frank Capra message film \"The Negro Soldier\", a feature-length tribute shown to the armed forces and civilians during World War II.\nWorld War II.\nHecht was among a number of signers of a formal statement, issued in July 1941, calling for the \"utmost material assistance by our government to England, the Soviet Union, and China\". Among those who signed were former Nobel Prize winners in science and other people eminent in education, literature, and the arts. It advocated\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the protection of civil liberties and the rights of labor,\u00a0... the elimination of all forms of racial and religious discrimination from our public and private life\u00a0... [and] the worldwide defense of human liberty\u00a0... There can be no victory over Hitlerism abroad if democracy is destroyed at home.\nLater that year, he had his first large-scale musical collaboration with symphonic composer Ferde Grofe on their patriotic cantata, \"Uncle Sam Stands Up\".\nJewish.\nHecht claimed that he had never experienced anti-Semitism in his life, and claimed to have had little to do with Judaism, but \"was drawn back to the Lower East Side late in life and lived for a while on Henry Street, where he could absorb the energy and social consciousness of the ghetto\", wrote author Sanford Sternlicht. In 1931, he published a novel, \"A Jew in Love\", for which he was called, a \"self-hating Jew\", and which has been analysed as a product of a generation of Jewish writers seeking to escape their parent's immigrant past. \nHis indifference to Jewish issues changed when he met Peter Bergson, who was drumming up American assistance for the Zionist group Irgun. Hecht wrote in his book, \"Perfidy\", that he used to be a scriptwriter until his meeting with Bergson, when he accidentally bumped into history: that is, the burning need to do anything possible to save the doomed Jews of Europe (paraphrase from \"Perfidy\"). As Hecht relates it in \"A Child of the Century\", he didn't feel particularly Jewish in his daily life until Bergson shook him out of his assimilated complacency: Bergson invited Hecht to ask three close friends whether, in their opinion, Hecht was an American or a Jew. All three replied that he was a Jew. (This is incorrect; in his book, \"A Child of the Century\", Hecht says that he used that line to convince David Selznick to sponsor a mass meeting at the Hollywood canteen.)\nLike many stories Hecht told about his life, that tale may be apocryphal, but after meeting Bergson, Hecht quickly became a member of his inner circle and dedicated himself to some goals of the group, particularly the rescue of Europe's Jews.\nHecht \"took on a ten-year commitment to publicize the atrocities befalling his own religious minority, the Jews of Europe, and the quest for survivors to find a permanent home in the Middle East\". In 1943, during the midst of the Holocaust, he predicted, in a widely published article in \"Reader's Digest\" magazine,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Of these 6,000,000 Jews [of Europe], almost a third have already been massacred by Germans, Romanians, and Hungarians, and the most conservative of scorekeepers estimate that before the war ends, at least another third will have been done to death.\nAlso in 1943, \"out of frustration over American policy, and outrage at Hollywood's fear of offending its European markets\", he organized and wrote a pageant, \"We Will Never Die\", which was produced by Billy Rose and Ernst Lubitsch, with the help of composer Kurt Weill and staging by Moss Hart. The pageant was performed at Madison Square Garden for two shows in front of 40,000 people in March 1943. It then traveled nationwide, including a performance at the Hollywood Bowl. Hecht was disappointed nonetheless. As Weill noted afterward, \"The pageant has accomplished nothing. Actually, all we have done is make a lot of Jews cry, which is not a unique accomplishment.\"\nFollowing the war, Hecht openly supported the Jewish insurgency in Palestine, a campaign of violence being waged by underground Zionist groups (the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi) in Palestine. Hecht was a member of the Bergson Group, an Irgun front group in the United States run by Peter Bergson, which was active in raising money for the Irgun's activities and disseminating Irgun propaganda.\nHecht wrote the script for the Bergson Group's production of \"A Flag is Born\", which opened on September 5, 1946, at the Alvin Playhouse in New York City. The play, which compared the Zionist underground's campaign in Palestine to the American Revolution, was intended to increase public support for the Zionist cause in the United States. The play starred Marlon Brando and Paul Muni during its various productions. The proceeds from the play were used to purchase a ship that was renamed the MS \"Ben Hecht\", which carried 900 Holocaust survivors to Palestine in March 1947. The Royal Navy captured the ship after it docked, and 600 of its passengers were detained as illegal immigrants and sent to the Cyprus internment camps. The SS \"Ben Hecht\" later became the flagship of the Israeli Navy. The crew was imprisoned by the British authorities in Acre Prison, and assisted in the preparations for the Acre Prison break.\nHecht's most controversial action during this period was writing an open letter to the Jewish insurgents in May 1947 which openly praised underground violence against the British. It included the highly controversial passage:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSix months after the establishment of Israel, the Bergson Group was dissolved, followed by a dinner in New York City where former Irgun commander Menachem Begin appeared, saying,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I believe that my people, liberated and re-assembled in its country, will contribute its full share toward the progress of all mankind\u00a0... [and predicted] that all of Palestine eventually would be free, and that peace and brotherhood would prevail among Arabs and Jews alike.\nThanks to his fundraising, speeches, and jawboning, Sternlicht writes,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Ben Hecht did more to help Jewish refugees from the Holocaust, and to ensure the survival of the nascent state of Israel, than any other American Jew in the twentieth century\". As much as anything, it was the abiding love of his Jewish parents and Rose Hecht that motivated the writer to become arguably \"the most effective propagandist the Jewish state ever had. In 1964, at Hecht's funeral service at Temple Rodeph Shalom in New York City, among the eulogists was Menachem Begin.\"\nIn October 1948, the Cinematograph Exhibitors' Association, a trade union representing about 4,700 British film theaters, announced a ban on all films in which Hecht had a role. This was a result of \"his intemperate utterances on the Palestine problem\", according to one source. As a result, filmmakers, concerned with jeopardizing the British market, became more reluctant to hire Hecht. Hecht cut his fee in half and wrote screenplays under pseudonyms or completely anonymously to evade the boycott, which was lifted in 1952.\nDeath.\nHecht died of a heart attack at his home on April 18, 1964, aged 70.\nWorks.\nScreenplays.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62278", "revid": "196446", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62278", "title": "Naxos", "text": "Greek island in the Aegean Sea\nNaxos (; , ) is a Greek island belonging to the Cyclades island group. It is the largest island in the group. The largest town and capital of the island is Chora or Naxos City, with 8,897 inhabitants (2021 census). The main villages are Filoti, Apiranthos, Vivlos, Agios Arsenios, Koronos and Glynado. It was an important centre during the Bronze Age Cycladic Culture and in the Ancient Greek Archaic Period. The island is famous as a source of emery, a rock rich in corundum, which until modern times was one of the best abrasives available.\nHistory.\nMythic Naxos.\nAccording to Greek mythology, the young Zeus was raised in a cave on Mt. Zas (\"\"Zas\" meaning \"Zeus\"\"). Homer mentions \"Dia\"; literally the sacred island \"of the Goddess\". K\u00e1roly Ker\u00e9nyi explains:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This name, Dia, which means 'heavenly' or 'divine', was applied to several small craggy islands in our [Aegean] sea, all of them lying close to larger islands, such as Crete or Naxos. The name \"Dia\" was even transferred to the island of Naxos itself, since it was more widely supposed than any other to have been the nuptial isle of Dionysus.\nOne legend has it that in the Heroic Age before the Trojan War, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on this island after she helped him kill the Minotaur and escape from the Labyrinth. Dionysus (god of wine, festivities, and the primal energy of life) who was the protector of the island, met Ariadne and fell in love with her. But eventually Ariadne, unable to bear her separation from Theseus, either killed herself (according to the Athenians), or ascended to heaven (as the older versions had it). The Naxos portion of the Ariadne myth is also told in the Richard Strauss opera \"Ariadne auf Naxos\".\nThe giant brothers Otus and Ephialtes figure in at least two Naxos myths: in one, Artemis bought the abandonment of a siege they laid against the gods, by offering to live on Naxos as Otus's lover; in another, the brothers had actually settled Naxos.\nIt is also said that the sea god Poseidon was passing by Naxos whilst driving his chariot on the sea surface and is where he first laid eyes on his future wife, the nereid Amphitrite as she was dancing there.\nMiddle Paleolithic era.\nStelida quarry, south-west of Chora, contains Mousterian tools dating back to the Middle Paleolithic era, which indicates that Neanderthal activity on the island spanned almost 200,000 years ago. The extinct dwarf elephant species \"Palaeoloxodon lomolinoi\" lived on Naxos at some point during the Late Pleistocene.\nCycladic civilisation.\nZas Cave, inhabited during the Neolithic era, contained objects of stone from Melos and copper objects including a dagger and gold sheet. The presence of gold and other objects within the cave indicated to researchers the status of the inhabitant.\nEmery was exported to other islands during that time.\nClassical era and Greco-Persian Wars.\nDuring the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Naxos dominated commerce in the Cyclades.\nHerodotus describes Naxos circa 500 BC as the most prosperous Greek island.\nIn 499 BC, an unsuccessful attack on Naxos by Persian forces led several prominent men in the Greek cities of Ionia to rebel against the Persian Empire in the Ionian Revolt, and then to the Persian War between Greece and Persia.\nNaxos was the first Greek city-state to attempt to leave the Delian League circa 469 BC; Athens quickly quashed the notion and forcibly removed all military naval vessels from the island's control. Athens then demanded all future payments from Naxos in the form of gold rather than military aid.\nByzantine era.\nIn Late Antiquity, the island was part of the province of the Islands.\nPope Martin I was detained on the island of Naxos for almost a year after he was arrested by Byzantine authorities in Rome due to his holding of a synod that condemned monotheletism. He was held on the island prior to being taken to Constantinople for trial. While detained on the island, he wrote to a certain Theodore living in Constantinople.\nUnder the Byzantine Empire, Naxos was part of the thema of the Aegean Sea, which was established in the mid-9th century.\nIn Byzantine times, the island's capital was on the southern fortress of Apalyres. During this time, it suffered from Saracen raids, particular during the existence of the Emirate of Crete (824\u2013961), to which the island occasionally paid tribute. Traces of Muslim artistic influence are visible in frescoes from the 10th century. Nevertheless, as in Antiquity, Naxos was celebrated for its agriculture and animal husbandry; the 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi records extensive cattle raising on the island.\nIn the late 12th century, it may have been the capital of a short-lived thema of the \"Dodekanesos\".\nDuchy of Naxos.\nIn the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, with a Latin Empire under the influence of the Venetians established at Constantinople, the Venetian Marco Sanudo conquered Naxos and most of the other Cyclades in 1205\u20131207. Of all the islands, only on Naxos was there any opposition to Sanudo: a group of Genoese pirates had occupied the castle between the end of Byzantine rule and Sanudo's arrival. To steel his band's resolve, Sanudo burnt his galleys \"and bade his companions to conquer or die\". The pirates surrendered the castle after a five weeks' siege.\nNaxos became the seat of Sanudo's realm, known as the \"Duchy of Naxos\" or \"Duchy of the Archipelago\". Twenty-one dukes in two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, until 1566; Venetian rule continued in scattered islands of the Aegean until 1714. Under Venetian rule, the island was called by its Italian name, \"Nasso\".\nThe Sanudi introduced Western feudal law to the island, based on the \"Assizes of Romania\". However, the native Greek population continued to use Byzantine law for civil matters at least until the late 16th century.\nIn the 13th century, following the capture of Antalya and Alanya on the southern Anatolian coast by the Seljuk Turks, refugees from these areas settled in Naxos. In the 14th century, the island was once more exposed to raids, this time from the Anatolian Turkish beyliks, chiefly the Ayd\u0131nids. In turn, the Sanudi assisted the Genoese in capturing Chios in 1304 and the Knights Hospitaller in their conquest of Rhodes in 1309, in order to stop these islands being used as Turkish pirate base. Nevertheless, raids against Naxos are recorded in 1324 and 1326, and in 1341, Umur of Ayd\u0131n carried off 6,000 people from the island and imposed a payment of tribute. Two years later, however, the Smyrniote crusade captured his main port, Smyrna.\nThe relief was temporary, however, as Turkish raids recommenced later in the century. The island was so depopulated that Cristoforo Buondelmonti in c.\u20091420 claimed that there were not enough men to wed the Naxiot women. The rising Ottoman Empire first attacked the island in 1416, but the Sultans recognized Venetian overlordship over the Duchy in successive treaties, in exchange for an annual tribute.\nOttoman era (1566\u20131821).\nThe Ottoman administration remained essentially in the hands of the Venetians; the Porte's concern was satisfied by the returns of taxes. Very few Turks ever settled on Naxos, and Turkish influence on the island was insignificant. Under Ottoman rule the island was known in Turkish as . Ottoman sovereignty lasted until 1821, when the islands revolted; Naxos finally became part of the Greek state in 1832.\nEarly commentators.\nEarly commentators in English on the island include:\nBernard Randolph, in \"The Present State of the Islands in the Archipelago\" (1687, Oxford, pp.\u00a020\u201321).\nJean de Th\u00e9venot, in \"Travels into the Levant\" (1687, London, pp.\u00a0103\u2013105).\nJoseph Pitton de Tournefort, in \"A Voyage Into the Levant\" (1718, London, pp.\u00a0161\u2013176).\nThomas Bankes et al., in \"A new royal authentic and complete system of universal geography antient and modern...\" (1787, London, p.\u00a0943).\nEdward Daniel Clarke, in \"Travels in Various Countries\" (1814, vol. 3, section 2, London, pp.\u00a0377\u2013400).\nWilliam Martin Leake, in \"Travels in Northern Greece\" (1835, vol. 3, London, pp.\u00a093\u201395).\nTheodore Bent, in \"The Cyclades, or Life Among the Insular Greeks\" (1885, London, pp.\u00a0329\u2013371).\nGeography.\nClimate.\nNaxos experiences both a Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\") and a hot semi-arid climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification: \"BSh\") depending on the location. According to the stations of the National Observatory of Athens, various locations in Naxos have a hot semi-arid climate. Inland areas of the island are much wetter and cooler in winter, owing to their higher elevation.\nEconomy.\nTourism.\nNaxos is a popular tourist destination, with several places of touristic interest, including beaches, villages and old ruins. Beaches on the island include Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios, Aliko, Kastraki, Mikri Vigla, Plaka, and Agios Georgios, most of them on the western side of the island, near Chora. Like other cycladic islands, Naxos is considered a windy place perfect for windsurfing, as well as kitesurfing. There are seven sports clubs on the island that offer both of these sports and other water activities.\nAgriculture.\nNaxos is the most fertile island of the Cyclades. It has a good supply of water in a region where water is usually inadequate. Mount Zeus () is the highest peak in the Cyclades, and tends to trap the clouds, permitting greater rainfall. This has made agriculture an important economic sector with various vegetable and fruit crops as well as cattle breeding, making Naxos the most self-sufficient island in the Cyclades. Naxos is well known within Greece for its \"Arseniko Naxou\" cheese, potatoes, Kitron (a local lemon-citrus spirit), and Naxian honey (which is largely derived from the nectar of thyme).\nMarble.\nThe quarrying of marble on Naxos began before 550 BCE. Naxian marble was used for the creation of the roof tiles at ancient Olympia and on the Athenian Acropolis, As of 2016, about 5,000 m\u00b3 of high value Naxian marble was being exported annually.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

MSG is found naturally in some foods including tomatoes and cheese in this glutamic acid form. MSG is used in cooking as a flavor enhancer with a savory taste that intensifies the umami flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups.\nMSG was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who tried to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of \"kombu\", an edible seaweed used as a broth (\"dashi\") ingredient in Japanese cuisine. MSG balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes. MSG, along with disodium ribonucleotides, is commonly used and found in stock (bouillon) cubes, soups, ramen, gravy, stews, condiments, savory snacks, etc.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given MSG its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) designation. It is a popular misconception that MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, known as \"Chinese restaurant syndrome\". Several blinded studies show no such effects when MSG is combined with food in normal concentrations, and are inconclusive when MSG is added to broth in large concentrations. The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. MSG has the HS code 2922.42 and the E number E621.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUse.\nPure MSG is reported to have a highly unpleasant taste until it is combined with a savory aroma. The basic sensory function of MSG is attributed to its ability to enhance savory taste-active compounds when added in the proper concentration. The optimal concentration varies by food; in clear soup, the \"pleasure score\" rapidly falls with the addition of more than one gram of MSG per 100mL.\nThe sodium content (in mass percent) of MSG, 12.28%, is about one-third of that in sodium chloride (39.34%), due to the greater mass of the glutamate counterion, and the remainder, 87.72%, is glutamic acid. Although other salts of glutamate have been used in low-salt soups, they are less palatable than MSG. \nThe ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate (E631) and disodium guanylate (E627), as well as conventional salt, are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients as they seem to have a synergistic effect. \"Super salt\" is a mixture of 9 parts salt, to one part MSG and 0.1 parts disodium ribonucleotides (a mixture of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate).\nSafety.\nMSG is generally recognized as safe to eat. A popular belief is that MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, but blinded tests have not provided strong evidence of this. International bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer. Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The median lethal dose (LD50) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times the LD50 of table salt (3 g/kg in rats). The use of MSG as a food additive and the natural levels of glutamic acid in foods are not of toxic concern in humans. Specifically MSG in the diet does not increase glutamate in the brain or affect brain function.\nA 1995 report from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) for the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that MSG is safe when \"eaten at customary levels\" and, although a subgroup of otherwise-healthy individuals develop an MSG symptom complex when exposed to 3 g of MSG in the absence of food, MSG as a cause has not been established because the symptom reports are anecdotal.\nAccording to the report, no data support any role of glutamate in chronic disease. High quality evidence has failed to demonstrate a relationship between the MSG symptom complex and actual MSG consumption. No association has been demonstrated, and the few responses were inconsistent. No symptoms were observed when MSG was used in food.\nAdequately controlling for experimental bias includes a blinded, placebo-controlled experimental design and administration by capsule, because of the unique aftertaste of glutamates. In a 1993 study, 71 fasting participants were given 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred. A study in 2000 tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two people out of the 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not reproducible.\nStudies exploring MSG's role in obesity have yielded mixed results.\nAlthough several studies have investigated anecdotal links between MSG and asthma, current evidence does not support a causal association.\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) MSG technical report concludes, \"There is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality. The studies conducted to date on Chinese restaurant syndrome (CRS) have largely failed to demonstrate a causal association with MSG. Symptoms resembling those of CRS may be provoked in a clinical setting in small numbers of individuals by the administration of large doses of MSG without food. However, such effects are neither persistent nor serious and are likely to be attenuated when MSG is consumed with food. In terms of more serious adverse effects such as the triggering of bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals, the evidence does not indicate that MSG is a significant trigger factor.\"\nThe FSANZ MSG report says that although no data is available on average MSG consumption in Australia and New Zealand, \"data from the United Kingdom indicates an average intake of 590mg/day, with extreme users (97.5th percentile consumers) consuming 2,330mg/day\" (Rhodes et al. 1991). In a highly seasoned restaurant meal, intakes as high as 5,000\u00a0mg or more may be possible (Yang et al. 1997). When very large doses of MSG (&gt;5 g MSG in a bolus dose) are ingested, plasma glutamate concentration will significantly increase. However, the concentration typically returns to normal within two hours. In general, foods providing metabolizable carbohydrates significantly attenuate peak plasma glutamate levels at doses up to 150mg/kg body weight. Two earlier studies\u00a0\u2013 the 1987 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the 1995 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)\u00a0\u2013 concluded, \"there may be a small number of unstable asthmatics who respond to doses of 1.5\u20132.5 g of MSG in the absence of food\". The FASEB evaluation concluded, \"sufficient evidence exists to indicate some individuals may experience manifestations of CRS when exposed to a \u22653 g bolus dose of MSG in the absence of food\".\nProduction.\nMSG has been produced by three methods: hydrolysis of vegetable proteins with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds (1909\u20131962); direct chemical synthesis with acrylonitrile (1962\u20131973), and bacterial fermentation (the current method). Wheat gluten was originally used for hydrolysis because it contains more than 30\u00a0g of glutamate and glutamine per 100\u00a0g of protein. As demand for MSG increased, chemical synthesis and fermentation were studied. The polyacrylic fiber industry began in Japan during the mid-1950s, and acrylonitrile was adopted as a base material to synthesize MSG.\nAs of 2016, most MSG worldwide is produced by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for neutralization. During fermentation, \"Corynebacterium\" species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugarcane, tapioca or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. Kyowa Hakko Kogyo (currently Kyowa Kirin) developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.\nThe conversion yield and production rate (from sugars to glutamate) continues to improve in the industrial production of MSG, keeping up with demand. The product, after filtration, concentration, acidification, and crystallization, is glutamate, sodium ions, and water.\nChemical properties.\nThe compound is usually available as the monohydrate, a white, odorless, crystalline powder. The solid contains separate sodium cations Na+ and glutamate anions in zwitterionic form, \u2212OOC-CH(NH3+)-(CH2)2-COO\u2212. In solution, it dissociates into glutamate and sodium ions.\nMSG is freely soluble in water, but it is not hygroscopic and is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as ether). It is generally stable under food-processing conditions. MSG does not break down during cooking and, like other amino acids, will exhibit a Maillard reaction (browning) in the presence of sugars at very high temperatures.\nHistory.\nGlutamic acid was discovered and identified in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University isolated glutamic acid as a taste substance in 1908 from the seaweed \"Laminaria japonica\" (\"kombu\") by aqueous extraction and crystallization, calling its taste \"umami\" (\"delicious taste\"). Ikeda noticed that \"dashi\", the Japanese broth of \"katsuobushi\" and \"kombu\", had a unique taste not yet scientifically described (not sweet, salty, sour, or bitter). To determine which glutamate could result in the taste of \"umami\", he studied the taste properties of numerous glutamate salts such as calcium, potassium, ammonium, and magnesium glutamate. Of these salts, monosodium glutamate was the most soluble and palatable, as well as the easiest to crystallize. Ikeda called his product \"monosodium glutamate\" and submitted a patent to produce MSG; the Suzuki brothers began commercial production of MSG in 1909 using the term Ajinomoto (\"essence of taste\").\nSociety and culture.\nRegulations.\nUnited States.\nMSG is one of several forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is pervasive in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term \"spices and flavorings\". However, the term \"\"natural flavor/s\" is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require disclosure of components and amounts of \"natural flavor/s\"\".\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nStandard 1.2.4 of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires MSG to be labeled in packaged foods. The label must have the food-additive class name (e.g. \"flavour enhancer\"), followed by the name of the additive (\"MSG\") or its International Numbering System (INS) number, 621.\nPakistan.\nThe Punjab Food Authority banned Ajinomoto, commonly known as Chinese salt, which contains MSG, from being used in food products in the Punjab Province of Pakistan in January 2018. \nThe prohibition against the import and manufacture of MSG was enforced on 28 February 2018, following an order by the Supreme Court on 10 February 2018.\nIn 2024, the federal government lifted the ban on MSG, following objections from Japan and a review of scientific evidence by an expert committee. The committee comprising experts from various institutions\u2014including the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, National Agricultural Research Centre, and Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority\u2014confirmed MSG as a safe food additive.\nNames.\nThe following are alternative names for MSG:\nStigma in cuisine.\nOrigin.\nThe controversy surrounding the safety of MSG started with the publication of Robert Ho Man Kwok's correspondence letter titled \"Chinese-Restaurant Syndrome\" in the \"New England Journal of Medicine\" on 4 April 1968. In his letter, Kwok suggested several possible causes before he nominated MSG for his symptoms. This letter was initially met with insider satirical responses, often using race as prop for humorous effect, within the medical community. As the media picked up the conversations, they were treated as legitimate, but the racial motivations behind the humor were ignored\u2014reinforcing old racial stereotypes.\nDespite the resulting public backlash, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not remove MSG from their Generally Recognized as Safe list. In 1970, a National Research Council under the National Academy of Sciences, on behalf of the FDA, investigated MSG but concluded that MSG was safe for consumption.\nReactions.\nThese kind of perceptions, such as the rhetoric of the so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome, have been attributed to xenophobic or racist biases. Food historian Ian Mosby wrote that fear of MSG in Chinese food is part of the US's long history of viewing the \"exotic\" cuisine of Asia as dangerous and dirty. In 2016, Anthony Bourdain stated in \"Parts Unknown\" that \"I think MSG is good stuff ... You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism.\"\nIn 2020, Ajinomoto, the leading manufacturer of MSG, and others launched the #RedefineCRS campaign, in reference to the term \"Chinese restaurant syndrome\", to combat the misconceptions about MSG, saying they intended to highlight the xenophobic prejudice against East Asian cuisine and the scientific evidence. Following the campaign, Merriam-Webster announced it would review the term.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dinoflagellates are mostly marine plankton, but they are also common in freshwater habitats. Their populations vary with sea surface temperature, salinity, and depth. Many dinoflagellates are photosynthetic, but a large fraction of these are in fact mixotrophic, combining photosynthesis with ingestion of prey (phagotrophy and myzocytosis).\nIn terms of number of species, dinoflagellates are one of the largest groups of marine eukaryotes, although substantially smaller than diatoms. Some species are endosymbionts of marine animals and play an important part in the biology of coral reefs. Other dinoflagellates are unpigmented predators on other protozoa, and a few forms are parasitic (for example, \"Oodinium\" and \"Pfiesteria\"). Some dinoflagellates produce resting stages, called dinoflagellate cysts or dinocysts, as part of their lifecycles; this occurs in 84 of the 350 described freshwater species and a little more than 10% of the known marine species. Dinoflagellates are alveolates possessing two flagella, the ancestral condition of bikonts.\nAbout 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. Another estimate suggests about 2,000 living species, of which more than 1,700 are marine (free-living, as well as benthic) and about 220 are from fresh water. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater, and parasitic dinoflagellates.\nA rapid accumulation of certain dinoflagellates can result in a visible coloration of the water, colloquially known as red tide (a harmful algal bloom), which can cause shellfish poisoning if humans eat contaminated shellfish. Some dinoflagellates also exhibit bioluminescence, primarily emitting blue-green light, which may be visible in oceanic areas under certain conditions.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"dinoflagellate\" is a combination of the Greek \"dinos\" and the Latin \"flagellum\". \"Dinos\" means \"whirling\" and signifies the distinctive way in which dinoflagellates were observed to swim. \"Flagellum\" means \"whip\" and this refers to their flagella.\nHistory.\nIn 1753, the first modern dinoflagellates (\"Noctiluca\", although not formally named until 1816) were described by Henry Baker as \"Animalcules which cause the Sparkling Light in Sea Water\". Otto Friedrich M\u00fcller recorded \"Bursaria\" (now \"Ceratium\") \"hirundinella\" and \"Vorticella\" (now \"Peridinium\") \"cinctum\" in 1773.\nThe oldest generic name for a Dinoflagellate is \"Ceratium\", which was proposed by Schrank (1793).\nIn the 1830s, the German microscopist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg examined many water and plankton samples and proposed several dinoflagellate genera that are still used today including \"Peridinium, Prorocentrum\", and \"Dinophysis\".\nThese same dinoflagellates were first defined by Otto B\u00fctschli in 1885 as the flagellate order Dinoflagellida. Botanists treated them as a division of algae, named Pyrrophyta or Pyrrhophyta (\"fire algae\"; Greek \"pyrr(h)os\", fire) after the bioluminescent forms, or Dinophyta. At various times, the cryptomonads, ebriids, and ellobiopsids have been included here, but only the last are now considered close relatives. Dinoflagellates have a known ability to transform from noncyst to cyst-forming strategies, which makes recreating their evolutionary history extremely difficult.\nMorphology.\nDinoflagellates are unicellular and possess two dissimilar flagella arising from the ventral cell side (dinokont flagellation). They have a ribbon-like transverse flagellum with multiple waves that beats to the cell's left, and a more conventional one, the longitudinal flagellum, that beats posteriorly. The transverse flagellum is a wavy ribbon in which only the outer edge undulates from base to tip, due to the action of the axoneme which runs along it. The axonemal edge has simple hairs that can be of varying lengths. The flagellar movement produces forward propulsion and also a turning force. The longitudinal flagellum is relatively conventional in appearance, with few or no hairs. It beats with only one or two periods to its wave. The flagella lie in surface grooves: the transverse one in the cingulum and the longitudinal one in the sulcus, although its distal portion projects freely behind the cell. In dinoflagellate species with desmokont flagellation (e.g., \"Prorocentrum\"), the two flagella are differentiated as in dinokonts, but they are not associated with grooves.\nDinoflagellates have a complex cell covering called an amphiesma or cortex, composed of a series of membranes, flattened vesicles called alveoli (= amphiesmal vesicles) and related structures. In thecate (\"armoured\") dinoflagellates, these support overlapping cellulose plates to create a sort of armor called the theca or lorica, as opposed to athecate (\"nude\") dinoflagellates. These occur in various shapes and arrangements, depending on the species and sometimes on the stage of the dinoflagellate. Conventionally, the term tabulation has been used to refer to this arrangement of thecal plates. The plate configuration can be denoted with the plate formula or tabulation formula. Fibrous extrusomes are also found in many forms.\nA transverse groove, the so-called cingulum (or cigulum) runs around the cell, thus dividing it into an anterior (episoma) and posterior (hyposoma). If and only if a theca is present, the parts are called epitheca and hypotheca, respectively. Posteriorly, starting from the transverse groove, there is a longitudinal furrow called the sulcus. The transverse flagellum strikes in the cingulum, the longitudinal flagellum in the sulcus.\nTogether with various other structural and genetic details, this organization indicates a close relationship between the dinoflagellates, the Apicomplexa, and ciliates, collectively referred to as the alveolates.\nDinoflagellate tabulations can be grouped into six \"tabulation types\": gymnodinoid, suessoid, gonyaulacoid\u2013peridinioid, nannoceratopsioid, dinophysioid, and prorocentroid.\nMost Dinoflagellates have a plastid derived from secondary endosymbiosis of red algae, however dinoflagellates with plastids derived from green algae and tertiary endosymbiosis of diatoms have also been discovered. Similar to other photosynthetic organisms, dinoflagellates contain chlorophylls \"a\" and c2 and the carotenoid beta-carotene. Dinoflagellates also produce the xanthophylls including peridinin, dinoxanthin, and diadinoxanthin. These pigments give many dinoflagellates their typical golden brown color. However, the dinoflagellates \"Karenia brevis, Karenia mikimotoi,\" and \"Karlodinium micrum\" have acquired other pigments through endosymbiosis, including fucoxanthin.\nThis suggests their chloroplasts were incorporated by several endosymbiotic events involving already colored or secondarily colorless forms. The discovery of plastids in the Apicomplexa has led some to suggest they were inherited from an ancestor common to the two groups, but none of the more basal lines has them.\nAll the same, the dinoflagellate cell consists of the more common organelles such as rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lipid and starch grains, and food vacuoles. Some have even been found with a light-sensitive organelle, the eyespot or stigma, or a larger nucleus containing a prominent nucleolus. The dinoflagellate \"Erythropsidinium\" has the smallest known eye.\nSome athecate species have an internal skeleton consisting of two star-like siliceous elements that has an unknown function, and can be found as microfossils. Tappan gave a survey of dinoflagellates with internal skeletons. This included the first detailed description of the pentasters in \"Actiniscus pentasterias\", based on scanning electron microscopy. They are placed within the order Gymnodiniales, suborder Actiniscineae.\nTheca structure and formation.\nThe formation of thecal plates has been studied in detail through ultrastructural studies.\nThe dinoflagellate nucleus: dinokaryon.\n'Core dinoflagellates' (dinokaryotes) have a peculiar form of nucleus, called a dinokaryon, in which the chromosomes are attached to the nuclear membrane. These carry reduced number of histones. In place of histones, dinoflagellate nuclei contain a novel, dominant family of nuclear proteins that appear to be of viral origin, thus are called Dinoflagellate viral nucleoproteins (DVNPs) which are highly basic, bind DNA with similar affinity to histones, and occur in multiple posttranslationally modified forms. Dinoflagellate nuclei remain condensed throughout interphase rather than just during mitosis, which is closed and involves a uniquely extranuclear mitotic spindle. This sort of nucleus was once considered to be an intermediate between the nucleoid region of prokaryotes and the true nuclei of eukaryotes, so were termed \"mesokaryotic,\" but now are considered derived rather than primitive traits (i.\u00a0e. ancestors of dinoflagellates had typical eukaryotic nuclei). In addition to dinokaryotes, DVNPs can be found in a group of basal dinoflagellates (known as Marine Alveolates, \"MALVs\") that branch as sister to dinokaryotes (Syndiniales).\nClassification.\nGenerality.\nDinoflagellates are protists and have been classified using both the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN, now renamed as ICN) and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). About half of living dinoflagellate species are autotrophs possessing chloroplasts and half are nonphotosynthesising heterotrophs.\nThe peridinin dinoflagellates, named after their peridinin plastids, appear to be ancestral for the dinoflagellate lineage. Almost half of all known species have chloroplasts, which are either the original peridinin plastids or new plastids acquired from other lineages of unicellular algae through endosymbiosis. The remaining species have lost their photosynthetic abilities and have adapted to a heterotrophic, parasitic or kleptoplastic lifestyle.\nMost (but not all) dinoflagellates have a dinokaryon, described below (see: Life cycle, below). Dinoflagellates with a dinokaryon are classified under Dinokaryota, while dinoflagellates without a dinokaryon are classified under Syndiniales.\nAlthough classified as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei are not characteristically eukaryotic, as some of them lack histones and nucleosomes, and maintain continually condensed chromosomes during mitosis. The dinoflagellate nucleus was termed 'mesokaryotic' by Dodge (1966), due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as Golgi bodies, mitochondria, and chloroplasts.\nJakob Schiller (1931\u20131937) provided a description of all the species, both marine and freshwater, known at that time. Later, Alain Sournia (1973, 1978, 1982, 1990, 1993) listed the new taxonomic entries published after Schiller (1931\u20131937). Sournia (1986) gave descriptions and illustrations of the marine genera of dinoflagellates, excluding information at the species level. The latest index is written by G\u00f3mez.\nIdentification.\nEnglish-language taxonomic monographs covering large numbers of species are published for the Gulf of Mexico, the Indian Ocean, the British Isles, the Mediterranean and the North Sea.\nThe main source for identification of freshwater dinoflagellates is the \"S\u00fcsswasser Flora\".\nCalcofluor-white can be used to stain thecal plates in armoured dinoflagellates.\nEcology and physiology.\nHabitats.\nDinoflagellates are found in all aquatic environments: marine, brackish, and fresh water, including in snow or ice. They are also common in benthic environments and sea ice.\nEndosymbionts.\nAll Zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates and most of them are members within Symbiodiniaceae (e.g., the genus \"Symbiodinium\"). The association between \"Symbiodinium\" and reef-building corals is widely known. However, endosymbiontic Zooxanthellae inhabit a great number of other invertebrates and protists, for example many sea anemones, jellyfish, nudibranchs, the giant clam \"Tridacna\", and several species of radiolarians and foraminiferans. Many extant dinoflagellates are parasites (here defined as organisms that eat their prey from the inside, i.e. endoparasites, or that remain attached to their prey for longer periods of time, i.e. ectoparasites). They can parasitize animal or protist hosts. \"Protoodinium, Crepidoodinium, Piscinoodinium\", and \"Blastodinium\" retain their plastids while feeding on their zooplanktonic or fish hosts. In most parasitic dinoflagellates, the infective stage resembles a typical motile dinoflagellate cell.\nNutritional strategies.\nThree nutritional strategies are seen in dinoflagellates: phototrophy, mixotrophy, and heterotrophy. Phototrophs can be photoautotrophs or auxotrophs. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are photosynthetically active, but are also heterotrophic. Facultative mixotrophs, in which autotrophy or heterotrophy is sufficient for nutrition, are classified as amphitrophic. If both forms are required, the organisms are mixotrophic \"sensu stricto\". Some free-living dinoflagellates do not have chloroplasts, but host a phototrophic endosymbiont. A few dinoflagellates may use alien chloroplasts (cleptochloroplasts), obtained from food (kleptoplasty). Some dinoflagellates may feed on other organisms as predators or parasites.\nFood inclusions contain bacteria, bluegreen algae, diatoms, ciliates, and other dinoflagellates.\nMechanisms of capture and ingestion in dinoflagellates are quite diverse. Several dinoflagellates, both thecate (e.g. \"Ceratium hirundinella\", \"Peridinium globulus\") and nonthecate (e.g. \"Oxyrrhis marina\", \"Gymnodinium\" sp. and \"Kofoidinium\" spp.), draw prey to the sulcal region of the cell (either via water currents set up by the flagella or via pseudopodial extensions) and ingest the prey through the sulcus. In several \"Protoperidinium\" spp., e.g. \"P. conicum\", a large feeding veil\u2014a pseudopod called the pallium\u2014is extruded to capture prey which is subsequently digested extracellularly (= pallium-feeding). \"Oblea\", \"Zygabikodinium\", and \"Diplopsalis\" are the only other dinoflagellate genera known to use this particular feeding mechanism.\n\"Gymnodinium fungiforme\", commonly found as a contaminant in algal or ciliate cultures, feeds by attaching to its prey and ingesting prey cytoplasm through an extensible peduncle. Two related genera, \"Polykrikos\" and \"Neatodinium\", shoot out a harpoon-like organelle to capture prey.\nSome mixotrophic dinoflagellates are able to produce neurotoxins that have anti-grazing effects on larger copepods and enhance the ability of the dinoflagellate to prey upon larger copepods. Toxic strains of \"Karlodinium veneficum\" produce karlotoxin that kills predators who ingest them, thus reducing predatory populations and allowing blooms of both toxic and non-toxic strains of \"K. veneficum\". Further, the production of karlotoxin enhances the predatory ability of \"K. veneficum\" by immobilizing its larger prey. \"K. armiger\" are more inclined to prey upon copepods by releasing a potent neurotoxin that immobilizes its prey upon contact. When \"K. armiger\" are present in large enough quantities, they are able to cull whole populations of their copepod prey.\nThe feeding mechanisms of the oceanic dinoflagellates remain unknown, although pseudopodial extensions were observed in \"Podolampas bipes\".\nPigments in dinoflagellates.\nDinoflagellates possess a distinctive suite of photosynthetic pigments that allow them to survive and grow in a variety of aquatic environments. Like other phytoplankton, many dinoflagellates contain chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c, which are essential for photosynthesis and light energy capture. However, unlike green algae and higher plants, they lack chlorophyll b. Instead, they utilize chlorophyll c2, which is more efficient for absorbing blue-green light, making them well adapted to low-light or deeper water conditions. These pigments, along with carotenoids, contribute to the characteristic coloration of dinoflagellates, which can range from golden-brown to red.\nA unique pigment in dinoflagellates is peridinin, a specialized carotenoid that plays a key role in light harvesting and energy transfer to chlorophyll a. Peridinin is highly efficient in capturing blue light, which penetrates deeper into the water column, giving many dinoflagellates a competitive advantage in stratified or turbid environments. Additionally, dinoflagellates contain other carotenoids such as diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin, which play important roles in photoprotection by dissipating excess light energy and preventing oxidative stress under high irradiance. These pigments are necessary for photoacclimation, allowing dinoflagellates to survive under fluctuating light conditions.\nNot all dinoflagellates rely solely on photosynthetic pigments for energy. Many species are heterotrophic or mixotrophic, meaning they can acquire nutrients through both photosynthesis and predation. Symbiotic dinoflagellates, such as Symbiodinium, play an important ecological role by forming mutualistic relationships with corals, where their pigments drive photosynthesis and energy production that sustain coral reef ecosystems. The unique pigment composition of dinoflagellates also contributes to large-scale phenomena such as harmful algal blooms and red tides, where high concentrations of pigmented cells cause dramatic discoloration of coastal waters and can produce toxic effects.\nBlooms.\nIntroduction.\nDinoflagellate blooms are generally unpredictable, short, with low species diversity, and with little species succession. The low species diversity can be due to multiple factors. One way a lack of diversity may occur in a bloom is through a reduction in predation and a decreased competition. The first may be achieved by having predators reject the dinoflagellate, by, for example, decreasing the amount of food it can eat. This additionally helps prevent a future increase in predation pressure by causing predators that reject it to lack the energy to breed. A species can then inhibit the growth of its competitors, thus achieving dominance.\nHarmful algal blooms.\nDinoflagellates sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Under such circumstances, they can produce toxins (generally called dinotoxins) in quantities capable of killing fish and accumulating in filter feeders such as shellfish, which in turn may be passed on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Some colorless dinoflagellates may also form toxic blooms, such as \"Pfiesteria\". Some dinoflagellate blooms are not dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.\nA red tide occurs because dinoflagellates are able to reproduce rapidly and copiously as a result of the abundant nutrients in the water. They contain toxins that affect surrounding marine life and people who consume them. A specific carrier is shellfish, which can introduce both nonfatal and fatal illnesses. One such poison is saxitoxin, a powerful paralytic neurotoxin.\nHuman inputs of phosphate further encourage these red tides, so strong interest exists in learning more about dinoflagellates, from both medical and economic perspectives. Dinoflagellates are known to be particularly capable of scavenging dissolved organic phosphorus for P-nutrient, several HAS species have been found to be highly versatile and mechanistically diversified in utilizing different types of DOPs. The ecology of harmful algal blooms is extensively studied.\nBioluminescence.\nAt night, water can have an appearance of sparkling light due to the bioluminescence of dinoflagellates. More than 18 genera of dinoflagellates are bioluminescent, and the majority of them emit a blue-green light. These species contain scintillons, individual cytoplasmic bodies (about 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter) distributed mainly in the cortical region of the cell, outpockets of the main cell vacuole. They contain dinoflagellate luciferase, the main enzyme involved in dinoflagellate bioluminescence, and luciferin, a chlorophyll-derived tetrapyrrole ring that acts as the substrate to the light-producing reaction. The luminescence occurs as a brief (0.1 sec) blue flash (max 476\u00a0nm) when stimulated, usually by mechanical disturbance. Therefore, when mechanically stimulated\u2014by boat, swimming, or waves, for example\u2014a blue sparkling light can be seen emanating from the sea surface.\nDinoflagellate bioluminescence is controlled by a circadian clock and only occurs at night. Luminescent and nonluminescent strains can occur in the same species. The number of scintillons is higher during night than during day, and breaks down during the end of the night, at the time of maximal bioluminescence.\nThe luciferin-luciferase reaction responsible for the bioluminescence is pH sensitive. When the pH drops, luciferase changes its shape, allowing luciferin, more specifically tetrapyrrole, to bind. Dinoflagellates can use bioluminescence as a defense mechanism. They can startle their predators by their flashing light or they can ward off potential predators by an indirect effect such as the \"burglar alarm\". The bioluminescence attracts attention to the dinoflagellate and its attacker, making the predator more vulnerable to predation from higher trophic levels.\nBioluminescent dinoflagellate ecosystem bays are among the rarest and most fragile, with the most famous ones being the Bioluminescent Bay in La Parguera, Lajas, Puerto Rico; Mosquito Bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico; and Las Cabezas de San Juan Reserva Natural Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Also, a bioluminescent lagoon is near Montego Bay, Jamaica, and bioluminescent harbors surround Castine, Maine. Within the United States, Central Florida is home to the Indian River Lagoon which is abundant with dinoflagellates in the summer and bioluminescent ctenophore in the winter.\nLipid and sterol production.\nDinoflagellates produce characteristic lipids and sterols. One of these sterols is typical of dinoflagellates and is called dinosterol.\nTransport.\nDinoflagellate theca can sink rapidly to the seafloor in marine snow.\nLife cycle.\nIntroduction.\nDinoflagellates have a haplontic life cycle, with the possible exception of \"Noctiluca\" and its relatives.\nThe life cycle usually involves asexual reproduction by means of mitosis, either through desmoschisis or eleutheroschisis. More complex life cycles occur, more particularly with parasitic dinoflagellates. Sexual reproduction also occurs, though this mode of reproduction is only known in a small percentage of dinoflagellates. This takes place by fusion of two individuals to form a zygote, which may remain mobile in typical dinoflagellate fashion and is then called a planozygote. This zygote may later form a resting stage or hypnozygote, which is called a dinoflagellate cyst or dinocyst. After (or before) germination of the cyst, the hatchling undergoes meiosis to produce new haploid cells. Dinoflagellates appear to be capable of carrying out several DNA repair processes that can deal with different types of DNA damage.\nDinoflagellate cysts.\nThe life cycle of many dinoflagellates includes at least one nonflagellated benthic stage as a cyst. Different types of dinoflagellate cysts are mainly defined based on morphological (number and type of layers in the cell wall) and functional (long- or short-term endurance) differences. These characteristics were initially thought to clearly distinguish pellicle (thin-walled) cysts from resting (double-walled) dinoflagellate cysts. The former were considered short-term (temporal) and the latter long-term (resting) cysts. However, during the last two decades further knowledge has highlighted the great intricacy of dinoflagellate life histories.\nMore than 10% of the approximately 2000 known marine dinoflagellate species produce cysts as part of their life cycle (see diagram on the right). These benthic phases play an important role in the ecology of the species, as part of a planktonic-benthic link in which the cysts remain in the sediment layer during conditions unfavorable for vegetative growth and, from there, reinoculate the water column when favorable conditions are restored.\nIndeed, during dinoflagellate evolution the need to adapt to fluctuating environments and/or to seasonality is thought to have driven the development of this life cycle stage. Most protists form dormant cysts in order to withstand starvation and UV damage. However, there are enormous differences in the main phenotypic, physiological and resistance properties of each dinoflagellate species cysts. Unlike in higher plants most of this variability, for example in dormancy periods, has not been proven yet to be attributed to latitude adaptation or to depend on other life cycle traits. Thus, despite recent advances in the understanding of the life histories of many dinoflagellate species, including the role of cyst stages, many gaps remain in knowledge about their origin and functionality.\nRecognition of the capacity of dinoflagellates to encyst dates back to the early 20th century, in biostratigraphic studies of fossil dinoflagellate cysts. Paul Reinsch was the first to identify cysts as the fossilized remains of dinoflagellates. Later, cyst formation from gamete fusion was reported, which led to the conclusion that encystment is associated with sexual reproduction. These observations also gave credence to the idea that microalgal encystment is essentially a process whereby zygotes prepare themselves for a dormant period. Because the resting cysts studied until that time came from sexual processes, dormancy was associated with sexuality, a presumption that was maintained for many years. This attribution was coincident with evolutionary theories about the origin of eukaryotic cell fusion and sexuality, which postulated advantages for species with diploid resting stages, in their ability to withstand nutrient stress and mutational UV radiation through recombinational repair, and for those with haploid vegetative stages, as asexual division doubles the number of cells. Nonetheless, certain environmental conditions may limit the advantages of recombination and sexuality, such that in fungi, for example, complex combinations of haploid and diploid cycles have evolved that include asexual and sexual resting stages.\nHowever, in the general life cycle of cyst-producing dinoflagellates as outlined in the 1960s and 1970s, resting cysts were assumed to be the fate of sexuality, which itself was regarded as a response to stress or unfavorable conditions. Sexuality involves the fusion of haploid gametes from motile planktonic vegetative stages to produce diploid planozygotes that eventually form cysts, or hypnozygotes, whose germination is subject to both endogenous and exogenous controls. Endogenously, a species-specific physiological maturation minimum period (dormancy) is mandatory before germination can occur. Thus, hypnozygotes were also referred to as \"resting\" or \"resistant\" cysts, in reference to this physiological trait and their capacity following dormancy to remain viable in the sediments for long periods of time. Exogenously, germination is only possible within a window of favorable environmental conditions.\nYet, with the discovery that planozygotes were also able to divide it became apparent that the complexity of dinoflagellate life cycles was greater than originally thought. Following corroboration of this behavior in several species, the capacity of dinoflagellate sexual phases to restore the vegetative phase, bypassing cyst formation, became well accepted. Further, in 2006 Kremp and Parrow showed the dormant resting cysts of the Baltic cold water dinoflagellates \"Scrippsiella hangoei\" and \"Gymnodinium\" sp. were formed by the direct encystment of haploid vegetative cells, i.e., asexually. In addition, for the zygotic cysts of \"Pfiesteria piscicida\" dormancy was not essential.\nGenomics.\nOne of the most striking features of dinoflagellates is the large amount of cellular DNA that they contain. Most eukaryotic algae contain on average about 0.54 pg DNA/cell, whereas estimates of dinoflagellate DNA content range from 3\u2013250 pg/cell, corresponding to roughly 3000\u2013215 000 Mb (in comparison, the haploid human genome is 3180 Mb and hexaploid \"Triticum\" wheat is 16 000 Mb). Polyploidy or polyteny may account for this large cellular DNA content, but earlier studies of DNA reassociation kinetics and recent genome analyses do not support this hypothesis. Rather, this has been attributed, hypothetically, to the rampant retroposition found in dinoflagellate genomes.\nIn addition to their disproportionately large genomes, dinoflagellate nuclei are unique in their morphology, regulation, and composition. Their DNA is so tightly packed that exactly how many chromosomes they have is still uncertain.\nThe dinoflagellates share an unusual mitochondrial genome organisation with their relatives, the Apicomplexa. Both groups have very reduced mitochondrial genomes (around 6 kilobases (kb) in the Apicomplexa vs ~16kb for human mitochondria). One species, \"Amoebophrya ceratii\", has lost its mitochondrial genome completely, yet still has functional mitochondria. The genes on the dinoflagellate genomes have undergone a number of reorganisations, including massive genome amplification and recombination which have resulted in multiple copies of each gene and gene fragments linked in numerous combinations. Loss of the standard stop codons, trans-splicing of mRNAs for the mRNA of cox3, and extensive RNA editing recoding of most genes has occurred. The reasons for this transformation are unknown. In a small group of dinoflagellates, called 'dinotoms' (Durinskia and Kryptoperidinium), the endosymbionts (diatoms) still have mitochondria, making them the only organisms with two evolutionarily distinct mitochondria.\nIn most of the species, the plastid genome consist of just 14 genes.\nThe DNA of the plastid in the peridinin-containing dinoflagellates is contained in a series of small circles called minicircles. Each circle contains one or two polypeptide genes. The genes for these polypeptides are chloroplast-specific because their homologs from other photosynthetic eukaryotes are exclusively encoded in the chloroplast genome. Within each circle is a distinguishable 'core' region. Genes are always in the same orientation with respect to this core region.\nIn terms of DNA barcoding, ITS sequences can be used to identify species, where a genetic distance of p\u22650.04 can be used to delimit species, which has been successfully applied to resolve long-standing taxonomic confusion as in the case of resolving the Alexandrium tamarense complex into five species. A recent study revealed a substantial proportion of dinoflagellate genes encode for unknown functions, and that these genes could be conserved and lineage-specific.\nEvolutionary history.\nDinoflagellates are mainly represented as fossils by dinocysts, which have a long geological record with lowest occurrences during the mid-Triassic, whilst geochemical markers suggest a presence to the Early Cambrian. Some evidence indicates dinosteroids in many Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks might be the product of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates). Dinoflagellates show a classic radiation of morphologies during the Late Triassic through the Middle Jurassic. More modern-looking forms proliferate during the later Jurassic and Cretaceous. This trend continues into the Cenozoic, albeit with some loss of diversity.\nMolecular phylogenetics show that dinoflagellates are grouped with ciliates and apicomplexans (=Sporozoa) in a well-supported clade, the alveolates. The closest relatives to dinokaryotic dinoflagellates appear to be apicomplexans, \"Perkinsus, Parvilucifera\", syndinians, and \"Oxyrrhis\". Molecular phylogenies are similar to phylogenies based on morphology.\nThe earliest stages of dinoflagellate evolution appear to be dominated by parasitic lineages, such as perkinsids and syndinians (e.g. \"Amoebophrya\" and \"Hematodinium\").\nAll dinoflagellates contain red algal plastids or remnant (nonphotosynthetic) organelles of red algal origin. The parasitic dinoflagellate \"Hematodinium\" however lacks a plastid entirely. Some groups that have lost the photosynthetic properties of their original red algae plastids has obtained new photosynthetic plastids (chloroplasts) through so-called serial endosymbiosis, both secondary and tertiary:\nSome species also perform kleptoplasty:\nDinoflagellate evolution has been summarized into five principal organizational types: prorocentroid, dinophysoid, gonyaulacoid, peridinioid, and gymnodinoid.\nThe transitions of marine species into fresh water have been frequent events during the diversification of dinoflagellates and have occurred recently.\nMany dinoflagellates also have a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria, called cyanobionts, which have a reduced genome and has not been found outside their hosts. The Dinophysoid dinoflagellates have two genera, Amphisolenia and Triposolenia, that contain intracellular cyanobionts, and four genera; Citharistes, Histioneis, Parahistioneis, and Ornithocercus, that contain extracellular cyanobionts. Most of the cyanobionts are used for nitrogen fixation, not for photosynthesis, but some don't have the ability to fix nitrogen. The dinoflagellate \"Ornithocercus magnificus\" is host for symbionts which resides in an extracellular chamber. While it is not fully known how the dinoflagellate benefit from it, it has been suggested it is farming the cyanobacteria in specialized chambers and regularly digest some of them.\nRecently, the living fossil \"Dapsilidinium pastielsii\" was found inhabiting the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, which served as a refugium for thermophilic dinoflagellates, and others such as \"Calciodinellum operosum\" and \"Posoniella tricarinelloides\" were also described from fossils before later being found alive.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are currently grouped with the Stramenopiles and Rhizaria among the protists with tubulocristate mitochondria into the SAR supergroup.\nCharacteristics.\nThe most notable shared characteristic is the presence of cortical (near the surface) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) arranged as a layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically contributing to a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In armored dinoflagellates they may contain stiff plates. Alveolates have mitochondria with tubular cristae (invaginations), and cells often have pore-like intrusions through the cell surface. The group contains free-living and parasitic organisms, predatory flagellates, and photosynthetic organisms.\nAlmost all sequenced mitochondrial genomes of ciliates and apicomplexa are linear. The mitochondria almost all carry mtDNA of their own but with greatly reduced genome sizes. Exceptions are \"Cryptosporidium\" which are left with only a mitosome, the circular mitochondrial genomes of \"Acavomonas\" and \"Babesia microti\", and \"Toxoplasma\"'s highly fragmented mitochondrial genome, consisting of 21 sequence blocks which recombine to produce longer segments.\nHistory.\nThe relationship of apicomplexa, dinoflagellates and ciliates had been suggested during the 1980s, and this was confirmed in the early 1990s by comparisons of ribosomal RNA sequences, most notably by Gajadhar \"et al\". Cavalier-Smith introduced the formal name Alveolata in 1991, although at the time he considered the grouping to be a paraphyletic assemblage. Many biologists prefer the use of the colloquial name 'alveolate'.\nClassification.\nAlveolata include around nine major and minor groups. They are diverse in form, and are known to be related by various ultrastructural and genetic similarities:\nThe Acavomonidia and Colponemidia were previously grouped together as colponemids, a taxon now split because each has a distinctive organization or ultrastructural identity. The Acavomonidia are closer to the dinoflagellate/perkinsid group than the Colponemidia are. As such, the informal term \"colponemids\", as it stands currently, covers two non-sister groups within Alveolata: the Acavomonidia and the Colponemidia.\nThe Apicomplexa and dinoflagellates may be more closely related to each other than to the ciliates. Both have plastids, and most share a bundle or cone of microtubules at the top of the cell. In apicomplexans this forms part of a complex used to enter host cells, while in some colorless dinoflagellates it forms a peduncle used to ingest prey. Various other genera are closely related to these two groups, mostly flagellates with a similar apical structure. These include free-living members in \"Oxyrrhis\" and \"Colponema\", and parasites in \"Perkinsus\", \"Parvilucifera\", \"Rastrimonas\" and the ellobiopsids. In 2001, direct amplification of the rRNA gene in marine picoplankton samples revealed the presence of two novel alveolate lineages, called group I and II. Group I has no cultivated relatives, while group II is related to the dinoflagellate parasite \"Amoebophrya\", which was classified until now in the Syndiniales dinoflagellate order.\nSome studies suggested the haplosporids, mostly parasites of marine invertebrates, might belong here, but they lack alveoli and are now placed among the Cercozoa.\nThe ellobiopsids are of uncertain relation within the alveolates. Silberman et al 2004 establish that the \"Thalassomyces\" genus of ellobiopsids are alveolates using phylogenetic analysis, however as of 2016[ [update]] no more certainty exists on their place.\nPhylogeny.\nIn 2017, Thomas Cavalier-Smith described the phylogeny of the Alveolata as follows:\nTaxonomy.\nAlveolata [Alveolatobiontes]\nDevelopment.\nThe development of plastids among the alveolates is intriguing. Cavalier-Smith proposed the alveolates developed from a chloroplast-containing ancestor, which also gave rise to the Chromista (the chromalveolate hypothesis). Other researchers have speculated that the alveolates originally lacked plastids and possibly the dinoflagellates and Apicomplexa acquired them separately. However, it now appears that the alveolates, the dinoflagellates, the Chromerida and the heterokont algae acquired their plastids from a red alga with evidence of a common origin of this organelle in all these four clades.\nEvolution.\nA Bayesian estimate places the evolution of the alveolate group at ~https://\u00a0million years ago. The Alveolata consist of Myzozoa, Ciliates, and Colponemids. In other words, the term Myzozoa, meaning \"to siphon the contents from prey\", may be applied informally to the common ancestor of the subset of alveolates that are neither ciliates nor colponemids. Predation upon algae is an important driver in alveolate evolution, as it can provide sources for endosymbiosis of novel plastids. The term Myzozoa is therefore a handy concept for tracking the history of the alveolate phylum.\nThe ancestors of the alveolate group may have been photosynthetic. The ancestral alveolate probably possessed a plastid. Chromerids, apicomplexans, and peridinin dinoflagellates have retained this organelle. Going one step even further back, the chromerids, the peridinin dinoflagellates and the heterokont algae have been argued to possess a monophyletic plastid lineage in common, i.e. acquired their plastids from a red alga, and so it seems likely that the common ancestor of alveolates and heterokonts was also photosynthetic.\nIn one school of thought the common ancestor of the dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, \"Colpodella\", Chromerida, and \"Voromonas\" was a myzocytotic predator with two heterodynamic flagella, micropores, trichocysts, rhoptries, micronemes, a polar ring and a coiled open sided conoid. While the common ancestor of alveolates may also have possessed some of these characteristics, it has been argued that Myzocytosis was not one of these characteristics, as ciliates ingest prey by a different mechanism.\nAn ongoing debate concerns the number of membranes surrounding the plastid across apicomplexans and certain dinoflagellates, and the origin of these membranes. This ultrastructural character can be used to group organisms and if the character is in common, it can imply that phyla had a common photosynthetic ancestor. On the basis that apicomplexans possess a plastid surrounded by four membranes, and that peridinin dinoflagellates possess a plastid surrounded by three membranes, Petersen et al. have been unable to rule out that the shared stramenopile-alveolate plastid could have been recycled multiple times in the alveolate phylum, the source being stramenopile-alveolate donors, through the mechanism of ingestion and endosymbiosis.\nCiliates are a model alveolate, having been genetically studied in great depth over the longest period of any alveolate lineage. They are unusual among eukaryotes in that reproduction involves a micronucleus and a macronucleus. Their reproduction is easily studied in the lab, and made them a model eukaryote historically. Being entirely predatory and lacking any remnant plastid, their development as a phylum illustrates how predation and autotrophy are in dynamic balance and that the balance can swing one way or other at the point of origin of a new phylum from mixotrophic ancestors, causing one ability to be lost.\nEpigenetics.\nFew algae have been studied for epigenetics. Those for which epigenetic data are available include some algal alveolates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They are traditionally considered a division of algae among phycologists, under the name of Cryptophyta. They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats. Each cell is around 10\u201350 \u03bcm in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket. At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella. Some may exhibit mixotrophy. They are classified as superclass Cryptomonada, which is divided into two classes: heterotrophic Goniomonadea and phototrophic Cryptophyceae. The two groups are united under three shared morphological characteristics: presence of a periplast, ejectisomes with secondary scroll, and mitochondrial cristae with flat tubules. Genetic studies as early as 1994 also supported the hypothesis that \"Goniomonas\" was sister to Cryptophyceae. A study in 2018 found strong evidence that the common ancestor of Cryptomonada was an autotrophic protist.\nCharacteristics.\nCryptomonads are distinguished by the presence of characteristic extrusomes called ejectosomes, which consist of two connected spiral ribbons held under tension. If the cells are irritated either by mechanical, chemical or light stress, they discharge, propelling the cell in a zig-zag course away from the disturbance. Large ejectosomes, visible under the light microscope, are associated with the pocket; smaller ones occur underneath the periplast, the cryptophyte-specific cell surrounding.\nExcept for the class Goniomonadea, which lacks plastids entirely, and \"Cryptomonas paramecium\" (previously called \"Chilomonas paramecium\"), which has leucoplasts, cryptomonads have one or two chloroplasts. These contain chlorophylls \"a\" and \"c\", together with phycobiliproteins and other pigments, and vary in color (brown, red to blueish-green). Each is surrounded by four membranes, and there is a reduced cell nucleus called a nucleomorph between the middle two. This indicates that the plastid was derived from a eukaryotic symbiont, shown by genetic studies to have been a red alga. However, the plastids are very different from red algal plastids: phycobiliproteins are present but only in the thylakoid lumen and are present only as phycoerythrin or phycocyanin. In the case of \"Rhodomonas\", the crystal structure has been determined to 1.63\u00c5; and it has been shown that the alpha subunit bears no relation to any other known phycobiliprotein.\nA few cryptomonads, such as \"Cryptomonas\", can form palmelloid stages, but readily escape the surrounding mucus to become free-living flagellates again. Some \"Cryptomonas\" species may also form immotile microbial cysts\u2014resting stages with rigid cell walls to survive unfavorable conditions. Cryptomonad flagella are inserted parallel to one another, and are covered by bipartite hairs called mastigonemes, formed within the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the cell surface. Small scales may also be present on the flagella and cell body. The mitochondria have flat cristae, and mitosis is open; sexual reproduction has also been reported.\nClassification.\nThe first mention of cryptomonads appears to have been made by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1831, while studying Infusoria. Later, botanists treated them as a separate algae group, class Cryptophyceae or division Cryptophyta, while zoologists treated them as the flagellate protozoa order Cryptomonadina. In some classifications, the cryptomonads were considered close relatives of the dinoflagellates because of their (seemingly) similar pigmentation, being grouped as the Pyrrhophyta. Cryptomonad chloroplasts are closely related to those of the heterokonts and haptophytes, and the three groups were united by Cavalier-Smith as the Chromista. However, the case that the organisms themselves are closely related was counter-indicated by the major differences in cell organization (ultrastructural identity), suggesting that the three major lineages assigned to the chromists had acquired plastids independently, and that chromists are polyphyletic. The perspective that cryptomonads are primitively heterotrophic and secondarily acquired chloroplasts, is supported by molecular evidence. Parfrey et al. and Burki et al. placed Cryptophyceae as a sister clade to the Green Algae, or green algae plus glaucophytes. The sister group to the cryptomonads is likely the kathablepharids (also referred to as katablepharids), a group of flagellates that also have ejectisomes.\nOne suggested grouping is as follows: (1) \"Cryptomonas\", (2) \"Chroomonas/Komma\" and \"Hemiselmis\", (3) \"Rhodomonas/Rhinomonas/Storeatula\", (4) \"Guillardia/Hanusia\", (5) \"Geminigera/Plagioselmis/Teleaulax\", (6) \"Proteomonas sulcata\", (7) \"Falcomonas daucoides\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

( ) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 in New York by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer (1824\u20131906) and Charles F. Erhart (1821\u20131891), Pfizer is one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in North America.\nPfizer develops and produces medication and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company's largest products by sales are Eliquis (apixaban) ($7.3 billion in 2024 revenues, 11% of total revenues), Prevnar (a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine) ($6.4 billion in 2024 revenues, 10% of total revenues), Paxlovid (Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) ($5.7 billion in 2024 revenues, 9% of total revenues), Vyndaqel (tafamidis) ($5.4 billion in 2024 revenues, 8% of total revenues), Comirnaty (the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine) ($5.3 billion in 2024 revenues, 8% of total revenues), and Ibrance (palbociclib) ($4.3 billion in 2024 revenues, 6% of total revenues). In 2024, 61% of the company's revenues came from the United States, 4% came from China, and 35% came from other countries.\nThe company is ranked fifth on the list of largest biomedical companies by revenue. It is ranked the 69th on the \"Fortune\" 500 and 73rd on the \"Forbes\" Global 2000.\nHistory.\n1849\u20131950: Early history.\nPfizer was founded in 1849 as \"Charles Pfizer &amp; Company\" by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, two cousins who had immigrated to the United States from Ludwigsburg, Germany. The business produced chemical compounds, and was headquartered on Bartlett Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where they produced an antiparasitic called santonin. This was an immediate success, although it was production of citric acid that led to Pfizer's growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property in the area (by now the Williamsburg district of the city of Brooklyn, New York and beginning in 1898, the City of Greater New York) to expand its lab and factory, retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009. Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearby Clinton Hill district, known for its concentration of Gilded Age wealth.\nIn 1881, Pfizer moved its administrative headquarters to 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan, presaging the company's expansion to Chicago, Illinois, a year later. By 1906 sales exceeded $3million.\nWorld War I caused a shortage of calcium citrate. Pfizer imported the compound from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and due to the disruption in supply, the company began a search for an alternative. They found this in the form of a fungus capable of fermenting sugar to citric acid. By 1919, the company was able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source. The company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the deep-submergence mass production of penicillin, an antibiotic, during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers. The company also embarked on a global soil collection program related to improving production yields of penicillin which ultimately resulted in 135,000 samples.\nOn June 2, 1942, the company incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law.\n1950\u20131980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion.\nDue to price declines for penicillin, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer discovered oxytetracycline in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology. In 1959, the company established an animal health division with a farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.\nBy the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, Pfizer launched Feldene (piroxicam), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer's first product to reach $1billion in revenue.\nIn 1965, John Powers, Jr. became chief executive officer of the company, succeeding John McKeen.\nAs the area surrounding its Brooklyn, NY plant fell into decline in the 1970s and 1980s, the company formed a public-private partnership with New York City that encompassed the construction of low- and middle-income housing, the refurbishment of apartment buildings for the homeless and the establishment of a charter school.\nIn 1972, Edmund T. Pratt Jr. became chief executive officer of the company, succeeding John Powers, Jr.\n1980\u20132000: Development of Viagra, Zoloft, and Lipitor.\nIn 1981, the company received approval for Diflucan (fluconazole), the first oral treatment for severe fungal infections including candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and pityriasis versicolor.\nIn 1986, Pfizer acquired the worldwide rights to Zithromax (azithromycin), a macrolide antibiotic that is recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first line treatment for certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia, from Pliva.\nIn 1989, Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood created Viagra (sildenafil) for treating high blood pressure and angina, a chest pain associated with coronary artery disease. In 1991, it was patented in the United Kingdom as a heart medication. Early trials for the medication showed that it did not work for the treatment of heart disease, but volunteers in the clinical trials had increased erections several days after taking the drug. It was patented in the United States in 1996 and received approval by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1998. In December 1998, Pfizer hired Bob Dole as a spokesperson for the drug. The patents for Viagra expired in 2020.\nIn 1991, William C. Steere, Jr. became chief executive officers of the company, succeeding Edmund T. Pratt Jr.\nIn 1991 Pfizer also began marketing Zoloft (sertraline), an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class developed nine years earlier by Pfizer chemists Kenneth Koe and Willard Welch. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder in both adults and children. In 2005, the year before it became a generic drug, sales were over $3billion and over 100million people had been treated with the drug. The patent for Zoloft expired in the summer of 2006.\nIn 1996, Eisai, in partnership with Pfizer, received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for donepezil under the brand Aricept for treatment of Alzheimer's disease; Pfizer also received approval for Norvasc (amlodipine), an antihypertensive drug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class.\nIn 1997, the company entered into a co-marketing agreement with Warner\u2013Lambert for Lipitor (atorvastatin), a statin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Although atorvastatin was the fifth statin to be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction in low-density lipoprotein pattern C (LDL-C) than the other statin drugs. Upon its patent expiration in 2011, Lipitor was the best-selling drug ever, with approximately $125billion in sales over 14.5 years.\n2000\u20132010: Further expansion.\nIn 2001, Henry McKinnell became chief executive officer of the company, replacing William C. Steere, Jr.\nIn 2002, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation purchased stock in Pfizer.\nIn 2004, the company received approval for Lyrica (pregabalin), an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, and generalized anxiety disorder. The United States patent on Lyrica was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, extending the expiration date to 2018.\nIn July 2006, Jeff Kindler was named chief executive officer of the company, replacing Henry McKinnell.\nOn December 3, 2006, Pfizer ceased development of torcetrapib, a drug that increases production of HDL, which reduces LDL thought to be correlated to heart disease. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths than expected occurred in the group that took the medicine, and the mortality rate of patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor (82 deaths during the study) was 60% higher than those taking Lipitor alone (52 deaths during the study). Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1billion developing the failed drug and its stock price dropped 11% on the day of the announcement.\nBetween 2007 and 2010, Pfizer spent $3.3million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1million, and had another $5million of pending recoveries from civil lawsuits against makers of counterfeit prescription drugs. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts worldwide to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for trademark infringement.\nIn July 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at its manufacturing facility in Portage, Michigan. Portage was previously the world headquarters of Upjohn Company, which had been acquired as part of Pharmacia.\nAcquisitions and mergers.\nIn June 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert outright for $116billion. To satisfy conditions imposed by antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission, Pfizer sold off or transferred stakes in several minor products, including RID (a shampoo for treatment of head lice, sold to Bayer) and Warner-Lambert's antidepressant Celexa (which competes with Zoloft). The acquisition created what was, at the time, the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.\nIn 2003, Pfizer merged with Pharmacia, and in the process acquired Searle and SUGEN. Searle had developed Flagyl (metronidazole), a nitroimidazole antibiotic medication used particularly for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Searle also developed celecoxib (Celebrex) a COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. SUGEN, a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors, had pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction. The SUGEN facility was shut down in 2003 by Pfizer, with the loss of more than 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included sunitinib (Sutent), a cancer medication which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006. A related compound, SU11654 (Toceranib), was also approved for cancer in dogs, and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program.\nIn October 2006, the company announced it would acquire PowerMed.\nOn October 15, 2009, Pfizer acquired Wyeth for $68billion in cash and stock, including the assumption of debt, making Pfizer the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. The acquisition of Wyeth provided Pfizer with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, trademarked Prevnar 13; this is used for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine, developed by Wyeth in February 2000, led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age5 in the United States. Pfizer introduced an improved version of the vaccine in 2010, for which it was granted a patent in India in 2017. Prevnar 13 provides coverage of 13 bacterial variants, expanding beyond the original 7-valent version. By 2012, the rate of invasive infections among children under age5 had been reduced by an additional 50%.\n2010\u20132020: Further discoveries and acquisitions.\nIn 2010, Ian Read was named chief executive officer of the company.\nIn February 2011, Pfizer announced the closure of its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) in Sandwich, Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people. In March 2011, Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6billion in cash. King produced emergency injectables such as the EpiPen.\nOn September 4, 2012, the FDA approved bosutinib (Bosulif) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a rare type of leukemia and a blood and bone marrow disease that affects primarily older adults. In November 2012, Pfizer received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for Xeljanz, a tofacitinib, for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. The drug had sales of $1.77billion in 2018, and in January 2019, it was the top drug in the United States for direct-to-consumer advertising, passing adalimumab (Humira). In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Xeljanz (tofacitinib) as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Xeljanz's wholesale acquisition cost rose by 6%, leading to an additional $72 million in costs to U.S. payers.\nOn February 1, 2013, Zoetis, the Agriculture Division of Pfizer and later Pfizer Animal Health, became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $2.2billion. Later in 2013, Pfizer completed the corporate spin-off of its remaining stake in Zoetis.\nIn September 2014, the company acquired Innopharma for $225million, plus up to $135million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer's range of generic and injectable drugs.\nOn January 5, 2015, the company announced it would acquire a controlling interest in Redvax, expanding its vaccine portfolio targeting human cytomegalovirus. In February 2015, the company received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for palbociclib (Ibrance) for treatment of certain types of breast cancer. In March 2015, the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. In May 2015, Pfizer and a Bar-Ilan University laboratory announced a partnership based on the development of medical DNA nanotechnology. In June 2015, the company acquired Nimenrix and Mencevax, meningococcal vaccines, from GlaxoSmithKline for around $130million. In September 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17billion, including the assumption of debt. Hospira was the largest producer of generic injectable pharmaceuticals in the world. On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and Allergan announced a planned $160billion merger, in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever and the third largest corporate merger in history. The proposed transaction contemplated that the merged company maintain Allergan's Republic of Ireland domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to corporation tax at the relatively low rate of 12.5%. The deal was to constitute a reverse merger, whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to \"Pfizer, plc\". On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan terminated the merger agreement after the Obama administration and the United States Department of the Treasury introduced new laws intended to limit corporate inversions (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).\nIn June 2016, the company acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2billion, expanding its portfolio in both inflammation and immunology drugs areas. In August 2016, the company made a $40million bid for the assets of BIND Therapeutics, which was in bankruptcy. The same month, the company acquired Bamboo Therapeutics for $645million, expanding its gene therapy offerings. In September 2016, the company acquired cancer drug-maker Medivation for $14billion. In October 2016, the company licensed the anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, ONC-392, from OncoImmune. In November 2016, Pfizer funded a $3,435,600 study with the CDC Foundation to research \"screen-and-treat\" strategies for cryptococcal disease in Botswana. In December 2016, Pfizer acquired AstraZeneca's small-molecule antibiotics business for $1.575 billion.\nIn January 2018, Pfizer announced that it would end its work on research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease and Parkinsonism (a symptom of Parkinson's disease and other conditions). The company said about 300 researchers would lose their jobs. In July 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide, developed by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In August 2018, Pfizer signed an agreement with BioNTech to conduct joint research and development activities regarding mRNA-based influenza vaccines. In October 2018, effective January 1, 2019, Albert Bourla was promoted to chief executive officer, succeeding Ian Read, his mentor.\nIn July 2019, the company acquired Therachon for up to $810million, expanding its rare disease portfolio through Therachon's recombinant human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 compound, aimed at treating conditions such as achondroplasia. Also in July, Pfizer acquired Array Biopharma for $10.6billion, boosting its oncology pipeline. In August 2019, Pfizer merged its consumer health business with that of GlaxoSmithKline, into a joint venture owned 68% by GlaxoSmithKline and 32% by Pfizer, with plans to make it a public company. The transaction built on a 2018 transaction where GlaxoSmithKline acquired Novartis' stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. The transaction followed negotiations with other companies including Reckitt Benckiser, Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Procter &amp; Gamble. In September 2019, Pfizer initiated a study with the CDC Foundation to investigate the tracking of healthcare-associated infections, scheduled to run through to June 2023. In December 2019, Pfizer awarded the CDC Foundation a further $1,948,482 to continue its cryptococcal disease screening and treatment research in nine African countries.\n2020\u2013present: pandemic, corporate development, and Trump tariffs.\nCOVID-19 and vaccine development.\nIn March 2020, Pfizer joined the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator funding vehicle to expedite development of treatments against COVID-19. The $125 million initiative was launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with Mastercard and Wellcome Trust, with additional funding announced shortly after from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Madonna.\nThe following month, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health announced the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership to develop a coordinated research strategy for prioritizing and speeding up development of COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical products. Pfizer joined the partnership as an industry \"leadership organization\", and participated as a collaborator in ACTIV-led clinical trials. CEO Albert Bourla attended the GAVI COVAX AMC 2021 Investment Opportunity Launch Event, otherwise named One World Protected, on April 15, 2021.\nIn Canada, Pfizer endorsed the use of a vaccine passport mobile app developed by CANImmunize in order to record and track status of COVID-19 vaccination.\nAs the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, Pfizer partnered with BioNTech to study and develop COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates. Unlike many of its competitors, Pfizer took no initial research funds from the United States' Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, instead choosing to invest roughly $2 billion of its own funds. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said that he declined money from Operation Warp Speed to avoid government intervention, stating later that \"when you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way.\"\nIn May 2020, Pfizer began testing four different COVID-19 vaccine variations using lipid nanoparticle technology provided by Canadian biotechnology company Acuitas Therapeutics. Vaccines were injected into the first human participants in the U.S. in early May. In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that two of the partners' four mRNA vaccine candidates had won fast track designation from the FDA. The company began PhaseII-III testing on 30,000 people in the last week of July 2020 and was slated to be paid $1.95billion for 100million doses of the vaccine by the US government. In September 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed talks with the European Commission to provide an initial 200million vaccine doses to the EU, with the option to supply another 100million doses at a later date.\nOn November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, tested on 43,500 people, was found to be 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. The efficacy was updated to 95% a week later, described as a \"really a spectacular number\" and made Pfizer and BioNTech the first companies to develop and test a working vaccine for COVID-19.\nIn November and December 2020, regulators in various countries approved Pfizer's vaccine for emergency use.\nDevelopment of oral antivirals.\nIn November 2021, Pfizer launched a new COVID-19 oral antivirus treatment known as Paxlovid. In January 2022, the Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla confirmed that the trial results of a fourth dose were pending until March 2022. He said that the firm was setting up a collaboration to develop an anti-COVID pill treatment along with a French company, Novasep. He also said the COVID vaccine was \"safe and efficient\" for children. In May 2022, reports emerged of patients experiencing \"rebound\" symptoms after completing a five-day course of Paxlovid. The FDA responded by announcing they had performed additional analyses of the drug's clinical trial data, and decided against changing its recommendations. U.S. President Joe Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci were both reported to experience this rebound syndrome in the months that followed, while continuing to recommend the drug for those who may benefit from it.\nCorporate developments and acquisitions.\nIn September 2020, the company acquired a 9.9% stake in CStone Pharmaceuticals for $200million (HK$1.55billion), helping to commercialise its anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, CS1001. In October 2020, the company acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals. In November 2020, using a Reverse Morris Trust structure, Pfizer merged its off-patent branded and generic drug business, known as Upjohn, with Mylan to form Viatris, owned 57% by Pfizer shareholders.\nOn January 5, 2021, Pfizer introduced a new logo. In April 2021, Pfizer acquired Amplyx Pharmaceuticals and its anti-fungal compound fosmanogepix (APX001). In August, the company announced it would acquire Trillium Therapeutics Inc and its immuno-oncology portfolio for $2.3 billion.\nIn March 2022, the company acquired Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion in cash. In June 2022, the company acquired ReViral Ltd, for up to $525 million, gaining access to experimental drugs used to combat respiratory syncytial virus infections. In October 2022, the company acquired Biohaven Pharma and its calcitonin gene-related peptide programs for $11.6 billion. It also acquired Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion, boosting Pfizer's rare disease business.\nIn April 2023, Pfizer moved its world headquarters from 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan to the Spiral at Hudson Yards.\nIn December 2023, the company acquired Seagen, a pioneer of antibody\u2013drug conjugates for the treatment of cancer, for $43billion.\nIn March 2025, the company sold its entire stake in Haleon for $3.24 billion to institutional investors.\nPartnership with Flagship Pioneering.\nIn July 2024, Pfizer and Flagship Pioneering announced an \"Innovation Supply Chain\" partnership to co-develop 10 drug candidates. Each party committed $50 million upfront, leveraging Flagship's ecosystem of over 40 startups to align with Pfizer's priorities. Pfizer will fund the selected programs and has the option to license or acquire assets, with potential success milestones and royalties reaching up to $700 million per commercialized drug. Two programs, focused on obesity and cardiovascular diseases, have already been initiated.\nThe partnership represents a new model in pharmaceutical R&amp;D, focusing on early collaboration with startups to streamline drug development. For startups, the model provides an opportunity for early engagement with pharmaceutical companies, offering potential funding and reduced uncertainty in development programs.\nCollaboration with Ignition AI Accelerator.\nIn October 2024, Pfizer announced a partnership with the Ignition AI Accelerator, a collaborative initiative by NVIDIA, Tribe, and Digital Industry Singapore (DISG). The collaboration aims using artificial intelligence to expedite drug discovery and development processes, improve operational efficiency, and streamline stakeholder engagement. The initiative also focuses on optimizing manufacturing processes, including improving yields and reducing cycle times.\nExpanding AI Collaboration for Clinical Trials with Saama.\nSaama and Pfizer reached an expanded multi-year agreement to integrate AI-driven solutions across Pfizer's R&amp;D portfolio, building on their 2020 partnership. Initially the partnership focused on automating data review processes with the Smart Data Quality (SDQ) platform \u2014 developed during Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine trials \u2014 the partnership as of 2024 scales to streamline data review and accelerate regulatory submissions across global studies. The expanded collaboration introduces Saama's Biometrics Research and Analysis Information Network, enabling faster statistical programming, biostatistics workflows, and submission-ready outputs.\nAcquisitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Pfizer acquisitions\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAreas of focus.\nPfizer focuses on addressing critical health challenges through innovation in various therapeutic areas. In the field of rare diseases, the company develops treatments for conditions such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and Gaucher disease, with an inclination on gene therapy and improving diagnostic resources for patients with unmet medical needs.\nInternal medicine.\nPfizer has a longstanding history in vaccines, contributing to breakthroughs in diseases like polio and smallpox. Currently, the company focuses on vaccines for pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Lyme disease, and Clostridioides difficile. It also invests in maternal and neonatal vaccines, cancer prevention, and efforts to mitigate hospital-acquired infections. It also works in advancing therapies for issues related to metabolic and cardiovascular health, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\nObesity treatment developments.\nPfizer has advanced its obesity treatment research through the development of danuglipron, an oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist:\nDose optimization trials are planned for late 2024 to support large-scale registration studies.\nIn November 2025, Pfizer agreed to acquire Metsera to expand its weight-loss drug portfolio in a deal that had the potential to exceed $10 billion. \nOncology.\nPfizer develops targeted therapies to treat multiple cancer types, including bladder, breast, cervical, lung, and colorectal cancers, as well as hematological malignancies. The company conducts research on precision medicine and immunotherapy, aiming to improve survival rates and quality of life for cancer patients. Specially, the acquisition of Seagen has supported further development of oncology treatments, including mRNA cancer vaccines.\nAdvances in AI, gene therapy, and breakthrough treatments.\nPfizer has also started initiatives which aim to address healthcare challenges across various regions and therapeutic areas in advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), gene therapy, obesity treatments, and oncology research. In 2023, Pfizer's affordability and access programs reached 45 million patients in the MERA region, supported by the IUdo app, which was launched in Egypt, Qatar, and Lebanon to facilitate patient access to care. In 2024, Pfizer focuses on integrating AI and gene therapy in the Middle East, Russia, and Africa (MERA) region, with its headquarters in Dubai. Key initiatives include:\nLegal issues.\nAggressive pharmaceutical marketing.\nPfizer has been accused of aggressive pharmaceutical marketing.\nIllegal marketing of gabapentin for off-label uses settlement (2004).\nIn 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin only for treatment of seizures. Warner\u2013Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used continuing medical education and medical research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within five years, the drug was being widely used for off-label uses such as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner\u2013Lambert admitted to violating FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses. In 2004, the company paid $430million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the False Claims Act. A Cochrane review concluded that gabapentin is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis. The American Academy of Neurology rates it as having unproven efficacy, while the Canadian Headache Society and the European Federation of Neurological Societies rate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence.\nIllegal marketing of Bextra settlement (2009).\nIn September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of arthritis drug valdecoxib (Bextra) and agreed to a $2.3billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time. Pfizer promoted the sale of the drug for several uses and dosages that the Food and Drug Administration specifically declined to approve due to safety concerns. The drug was pulled from the market in 2005. It was Pfizer's fourth such settlement in a decade. The payment included $1.195billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and $1.0billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) leading to violations under the False Claims Act as reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs. The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States to date. Pfizer entered a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General that required it to make substantial structural reforms within the company, and publish to its website its post approval commitments and a searchable database of all payments to physicians made by the company.\nTermination of Peter Rost (2005).\nPeter Rost was vice president in charge of the endocrinology division at Pharmacia before its acquisition by Pfizer. During that time he raised concerns internally about kickbacks and off-label marketing of Genotropin, Pharmacia's human growth hormone drug. Pfizer reported the Pharmacia marketing practices to the FDA and Department of Justice; Rost was unaware of this and filed an FCA lawsuit against Pfizer. Pfizer kept him employed, but isolated him until the FCA suit was unsealed in 2005. The Justice Department declined to intervene, and Pfizer fired him, and he filed a wrongful termination suit against Pfizer. Pfizer won a summary dismissal of the case, with the court ruling that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblower activities.\nIllegal marketing of Rapamune settlement (2014).\nA \"whistleblower suit\" was filed in 2005 against Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, alleging that the company illegally marketed sirolimus (Rapamune) for off-label uses, targeted specific doctors and medical facilities to increase sales of Rapamune, tried to get transplant patients to change from their transplant drugs to Rapamune, and specifically targeted African Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals that prescribed the drug with kickbacks such as grants, donations, and other money. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to criminal mis-branding violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. By August 2014, it had paid $491million in civil and criminal penalties related to Rapamune.\nIllegal marketing settlement (2014).\nIn June 2010, health insurance network Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for allegedly illegally marketing drugs Bextra, Geodon and Lyrica. BCBS alleged that Pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs. According to the lawsuit, Pfizer handed out 'misleading' materials on off-label uses, sent over 5,000 doctors on trips to the Caribbean or around the United States, and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for listening to lectures about Bextra. Despite Pfizer's claims that \"the company's intent was pure\" in fostering a legal exchange of information among doctors, an internal marketing plan revealed that Pfizer intended to train physicians \"to serve as public relations spokespeople.\" The case was settled in 2014 for $325million. Fearing that Pfizer is \"too big to fail\" and that prosecuting the company would result in disruptions to Medicare and Medicaid, federal prosecutors instead charged a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Pfizer, which is \"nothing more than a shell company whose only function is to plead guilty.\"\nQuigley Company asbestos settlement (2013).\nThe Quigley Company, which sold asbestos-containing insulation products until the early 1970s, was acquired by Pfizer in 1968. In June 2013, asbestos victims and Pfizer negotiated a settlement that required Pfizer to pay a total of $964million: $430million to 80% of existing plaintiffs and place an additional $535million into a settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20% of plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley. Of that $535million, $405million is in a 40-year note from Pfizer, while $100million is from insurance policies.\nShiley defective heart valves settlement (1994).\nPfizer purchased Shiley in 1979, at the onset of its Convexo-Concave valve ordeal, involving the Bjork\u2013Shiley valve. Approximately 500 people died when defective heart valves fractured and, in 1994, Pfizer agreed to pay $10.75million to settle claims by the United States Department of Justice that the company lied to get approval for the valves.\nFiring of employee that filed suit (2010).\nA federal lawsuit was filed by a scientist claiming she got an infection by a genetically modified lentivirus while working for Pfizer, resulting in intermittent paralysis. A judge dismissed the case citing a lack of evidence that the illness was caused by the virus but the jury ruled that by firing the employee, Pfizer violated laws protecting freedom of speech and whistleblowers and awarded her $1.37million.\nCelebrex intellectual property settlement (2012).\nBrigham Young University (BYU) said a professor of chemistry, Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that led towards development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking a 15% royalty on sales, equating to $9.7billion. A research agreement had been made between BYU and Monsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems and Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A six-year battle ensued because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give Dr. Simmons credit or compensation, while Pfizer claimed that it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. In May 2012, Pfizer settled the allegations, agreeing to pay $450million.\nNigeria Trovafloxacin lawsuit settlement (2011).\nIn 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled to Kano to set up a clinical trial and administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Tests in animals showed that Trovan had life-threatening side effects, including joint disease, abnormal cartilage growth, liver damage, and a degenerative bone condition. Pfizer's representatives did not alert the parents or patients about the serious risks involved, or tell them about an effective conventional treatment that Doctors without Borders was providing at the same site. Local Kano officials reported that more than fifty children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities such as blindness, deafness, paralysis, and brain damage. The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment. According to \"Democracy Now!\", \"[r]esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug.\" The lawsuits also accused Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. Nigerian medical personnel as well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval.\nIn 2007, Pfizer published a Statement of Defense letter, claiming that Trozan was safely tested in five thousand patients prior to the Nigerian children clinical trial, and mortality in the patients treated by Pfizer was lower than that observed historically in African meningitis epidemics. They claim that the effects suffered by the victims were due to meningitis and not Trovan. Pfizer states that its actions did not violate any law, as there was no law in Nigeria that requires ethical committee approval prior to conducting a clinical trial. However, the drug was never tested in children before. Pfizier claims that no unusual side effects, unrelated to meningitis, were observed after four weeks in the Nigerian children clinical study, though an investigation by the Washington Post revealed that one of the children continued to have the drug administered to them until their death despite their condition worsening, which violated ethical guidelines. \nIn March 2001 the license for Trovan was withdrawn in Europe, by the European Commission due to liver toxicity and some deaths. \nIn June 2010, the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer's appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed. \nIn December 2010, the United States diplomatic cables leak indicated that Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigerian attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to persuade him to drop legal action. \"The Washington Post\" reporter Joe Stephens, who helped break the story in 2000, called these actions \"dangerously close to blackmail\". In response, the company released a press statement describing the allegations as \"preposterous\" and saying that it acted in good faith. Aondoakka, who had allegedly demanded bribes from Pfizer in return for a settlement of the case, was declared unfit for office and had his U.S. visa revoked in association with corruption charges in 2010.\nThe lawsuits were eventually settled out of court. Pfizer committed to paying US$ \"to compensate the families of children in the study\", another $30 million to \"support healthcare initiatives in Kano\", and $10 million to cover legal costs. Payouts began in 2011.\nInflating prices fine (2022).\nIn July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer \u00a363 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures. The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin's price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised. It was stated that over a four-year period, Pfizer had billed Epanutin for around 780% and 1,600% higher than its standard price.\nAllegations of patent infringement on mRNA technology (2022).\nIn August 2022, Moderna announced that it will sue Pfizer and its partner BioNTech for infringing their patent on the mRNA technology. In May 2024, the European Patent Office upheld the validity of Moderna's EP949 patent, one of the two patents asserted against Pfizer and BioNTech.\nCOVID-19 vaccine controversy.\nIn February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) of employing \"high-level bullying\" against at least two Latin American countries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets as collateral for payments. According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer reaching a vaccine agreement with one country and a complete failure to reach agreements with two other countries, including Argentina and Brazil.\nIn November 2021, TBMJ published an article after obtaining information from a whistleblower from the Ventavia Research Group. Ventavia was hired by Pfizer as a research subcontractor. A regional director (whistleblower) who was employed at Ventavia Research Group has told \"The BMJ\" that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer's pivotal phase III trial. The regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated in a response to the European Parliament, that \"the deficiencies identified do not jeopardize the quality and integrity of the data from the main Comirnaty trial and have no impact on the benefit-risk assessment or on the conclusions on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine\". \"Science-Based Medicine\" emphasized that Ventavia oversaw just three of the 153 clinical sites involved with Pfizer's trial and \"a small fraction (~1,000 by the time the whistleblower was fired) of the trial's over ~44,000 subjects.\"\nOn 10 October 2022, during a session of the European Parliament's Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pfizer executive Janine Small testified that the company had not evaluated the Pfizer\u2013BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for its ability to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus prior to its release to the general public. Dutch MEP Rob Roos described the admission as \"scandalous\". CEO Albert Bourla was slated to attend, but withdrew. Roos' statements in turn have been described as \"misleading\".\nEnvironmental record.\nSince 2000, the company has implemented more than 4,000 greenhouse gas reduction projects.\nPfizer has inherited Wyeth's liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, a highly toxic EPA Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses. The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have opposed the cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA's position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.\nIn June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured 7 people and caused the evacuation of more than 100 homes in the surrounding area.\nContributions.\nNotable organizations to which Pfizer has provided funding include the Institute for Advanced Study, University of Toronto, and member of the President's Circle. University of Washington, Habitat for Humanity, Human Rights Campaign, National Women's Law Center, Share Our Strength, WaterAid, National Geographic, National Geographic Society, 94th Academy Awards, National Press Foundation, 19 to Zero, American Society of Hematology, Canadian Cancer Society, Canadian Paediatric Society, Endocrine Society, and European Society of Cardiology.\nThe company spends $10-15 million per year on lobbying in the United States. It also lobbies the Government of Ontario and House of Commons of Canada through Rubicon Strategy, a firm owned by Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario campaign manager Kory Teneycke. Pfizer lobbied various officials in the Government of British Columbia between April and November 2012, including then-premier Christy Clark, future premier John Horgan, future health minister Adrian Dix, and future deputy premier, minister of public safety and solicitor general Mike Farnworth.\nNotable professional associations to which Pfizer has contributed include American Statistical Association, Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians, Canadian Medical Association, Canadian Pharmacists Association, Canadian Pharmacists Journal, Canadian Public Health Association, Ontario Medical Association, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute, Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), North Bay Regional Health Center, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Scarborough Health Network, Sinai Health Foundation, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Bridgepoint Active Healthcare, and the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre \u2013 Donor. William Osler Health System, Ronald McDonald House Charities, AdvaMed, Arthritis Australia, Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative, GISAID, Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, Mount Sinai Hospital (Toronto), and Truth Initiative.\nNotable lobbying organizations to which the company has contributed include BIOTECanada, Bipartisan Policy Center, The Business Council, Business Council for the United Nations, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations, Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, Global Health Council, Innovative Medicines Canada, International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers &amp; Associations, National Health Council, Pharmaceutical Advertising Advisory Board, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Reagan-Udall Foundation, U.S. Global Leadership Coalition, and World Economic Forum.\nScott Gottlieb, who resigned as FDA commissioner in April 2019, joined the Pfizer board of directors in July 2019.\nThe Pfizer Award.\nThe Pfizer Award, established in 1958 by Pfizer, Inc., recognizes exceptional books on the history of science. The prize includes a medal and $2,500. Eligible books must be published in English within the three years preceding the competition year (e.g., for 2024, books from 2021\u20132023). Edited volumes and books with more than two authors are excluded, though multi-volume works by one or two authors may qualify once all volumes are published. While books with themes in medicine or technology may be considered, the award prioritizes works focused on the history of science. The prize is not divided between multiple books.&lt;ref name=\"hssonline.org/page\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe Royal Society Pfizer Award/The Royal Society Africa Prize.\nThe Royal Society Pfizer Award, established in 2006 with support from Pfizer Inc., recognized African research scientists contributing innovatively to biological and basic medical sciences, with a focus on capacity building in Africa. Recipients received a bronze medal, \u00a31,000, and an \u00a311,000 research grant for a project affiliated with an African scientific institution, such as a university or research center. The award was last presented in 2016 and has since been replaced by the Royal Society Africa Prize.\nThe Pfizer Foundation.\nThe Pfizer Foundation, established in 1953, is a charitable organization dedicated to building healthier communities worldwide. It operates independently of Pfizer Inc., with its mission centered on addressing global health challenges, supporting urgent health needs, and empowering Pfizer employees to create meaningful impacts in their communities.\nThe foundation also supports specific initiatives such as improving breast cancer care in Rwanda, empowering women and driving progress through Integrated Health Services in Benin, addressing vaccine access for zero-dose children in Nigeria, and collaborating with organizations like Direct Relief to strengthen healthcare providers in the United States.\nAwards and recognitions.\nPfizer has received numerous accolades and recognitions worldwide for its efforts in fostering an inclusive and equitable work environment beside the pharmaceutical activities. \nIn the United States, Pfizer earned a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign (2025) on the Corporate Equality Index for LGBTQ workplace equality and ranked highly in the Hispanic Association on Corporate Responsibility (2024) Corporate Inclusion Index. Pfizer was named a \"Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion\" in the Disability Equality Index (2024) and received awards such as Top Diverse Employer, Top Hispanic Employer, and Top Disability-Friendly Company by DiversityComm, Inc. (2024). Other recognitions include being named one of \"America's Greatest Workplaces\" by Newsweek (2023), Clinical Trials Arena Excellence Awards 2023, inclusion in the top 10 of the \"World's Most Admired Companies\" by Fortune (2023), and being listed as a Top Employer for Diversity and Best Employer for Women by Forbes (2022). Pfizer was also recognized as a \"Best Place to Work\" by Glassdoor (2021) and a Top Employer by Science (2021) for its practices during the pandemic.&lt;ref name=\"pharmavoice.com/news\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPfizer For All.\nPfizer introduced PfizerForAll, a digital platform designed to streamline access to healthcare and wellness resources in the United States. The platform supports individuals with common conditions like the flu, COVID-19, and migraines, as well as those seeking adult vaccinations. It integrates services such as same-day access to healthcare professionals, home delivery of prescriptions and diagnostic tests, appointment scheduling, and financial assistance for Pfizer medications.

Tampering with a certain legal instrument may be forbidden by law in some jurisdictions but such an offense is not related to forgery unless the tampered legal instrument was actually used in the course of the crime to defraud another person or entity. Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful misrepresentations.\nForging money or currency is more often called counterfeiting. But consumer goods may also be \"counterfeits\" if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the label or flagged by the trademark symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a false document.\nThis usage of \"forgery\" does not derive from metalwork done at a blacksmith's forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of \"to counterfeit\" is already in the Anglo-French verb \"forger\", meaning \"falsify\".\nA forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself \u2013 what it is worth or what it \"proves\" \u2013 than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a hoax. In a hoax, a rumor or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.\nThe similar crime of fraud is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including identity theft. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by security engineering.\nIn the 16th century, imitators of Albrecht D\u00fcrer's style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by signing them \"AD\", making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, and Henri Matisse.\nA special case of double forgery is the forging of Vermeer's paintings by Han van Meegeren, and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren's work by his son Jacques van Meegeren.\nCriminal law.\nEngland and Wales and Northern Ireland.\nIn England and Wales and Northern Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, which provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person is guilty of forgery if he makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or another shall use it to induce somebody to accept it as genuine, and by reason of so accepting it to do or not to do some act to his own or any other person\u2019s prejudice.\n\"Instrument\" is defined by section 8, \"makes\" and \"false\" by section 9, and \"induce\" and \"prejudice\" by section 10.\nForgery is triable either way. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.\nFor offences akin to forgery, see English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating.\nThe common law offence of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.\nScotland.\nForgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.\nThe Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803 was repealed in 2013.\nRepublic of Ireland.\nIn the Republic of Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which provides:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A person is guilty of forgery if he or she makes a false instrument with the intention that it shall be used to induce another person to accept it as genuine and, by reason of so accepting it, to do some act, or to make some omission, to the prejudice of that person or any other person.\nA person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.\nAny offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.\nExcept as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.\nCanada.\nForgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian Criminal Code. The offence is a hybrid offence, subject to a maximum prison sentence of:\nUnited States.\nForgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the United States, both state and federal. Most states, including California, describe forgery as occurring when a person alters a written document \"with the intent to defraud, knowing that he or she has no authority to do so.\" The written document usually has to be an instrument of legal significance. Punishments for forgery vary widely. In California, forgery for an amount under $950 can result in misdemeanor charges and no jail time, while a forgery involving a loss of over $500,000 can result in three years in prison for the forgery plus a five-year \"conduct enhancement\" for the amount of the loss, yielding eight years in prison. In Connecticut, forgery in the Third Degree, which is a class B misdemeanor is punishable by up to 6 months in jail, a $1000 fine, and probation; forgery in the First Degree, which is a class C felony, is punishable by a maximum 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 fine, or both.\nCivil law.\nAs to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62313", "revid": "1301937837", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62313", "title": "Pharmacia", "text": "Pharmaceutical and biotechnological company\nPharmacia was a pharmaceutical and biotechnological company in Sweden that merged with the American pharmaceutical company Upjohn in 1995.\nHistory.\nPharmacia company was founded in 1911 in Stockholm, Sweden by pharmacist Gustav Felix Gr\u00f6nfeldt at the \"Elgen\" Pharmacy. The company was named after the Greek word \u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03b1, transliterated \"pharmakeia\", which means 'sorcery'. In the company's early days, much of its profits were derived from the \"miracle medicine\" Phospho-Energon.\nDuring World War II, Swedish chemist Bj\u00f6rn Ingelman (who worked for Arne Tiselius at Uppsala university) researched various uses for the polysaccharide dextran. Together with the medical researcher Anders Gr\u00f6nwall, he discovered that dextran could be used as a replacement for blood plasma in blood transfusions, for which there could be a large need in wartime. Pharmacia, which then was still a small company, was contacted in 1943 and its CEO Elis G\u00f6th was very interested. The product Macrodex, a dextran solution, was launched four years later.\nDextran-based products were to play a significant role in the further expansion of Pharmacia. In 1951, the company moved to Uppsala, Sweden, to get closer to the scientists with whom they cooperated, and Ingelman became its head of research. In 1959, Pharmacia pioneered gel filtration with its Sephadex products. These were also based on dextran and discoveries in Tiselius' department, this time by Jerker Porath and Per Flodin. In 1967 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals was established in Uppsala. In 1986 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals acquired LKB-produkter AB and changed its name to Pharmacia Biotech. Pharmacia Biotech expanded their role in the \"biotech revolution\" through its acquisition of PL Laboratories from Pabst Brewery offering a line of recombinant DNA specialty research chemicals. Sold to private interests in the 1990s, Pharmacia was first merged with \"Kabi Vitrum\" to form Kabi Pharmacia with headquarters in Uppsala. In 1993, Kabi Pharmacia bought Farmitalia, an Italian company that had developed doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic.\nIn 1995 the company merged with the American pharmaceutical company Upjohn, becoming known as Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and moved its headquarters to London.\nIn 1998, the company was divided into two business area. The pharmaceutical business became Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. The scientific instruments groups which sold chromatography resin, purification equipment, molecular biology reagents and electrophoresis products was purchased by Amersham in 1998 and was named Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. They later changed the name to Amersham Biosciences and ran their radiochemical and reagents business along with the highly profitable chromatography business. The Pharmacia Logo Drop remained as a highly recognized brand. Amersham Biosciences was sold to GE Healthcare in 2004 to become GE Healthcare Life Sciences. From 1 April 2020, GE Healthcare Life Sciences has been renamed Cytiva, following the sale of GE Healthcare Life Sciences from General Electric to Danaher Corporation in a $21.4 billion acquisition.\nOverview.\nThe following is an illustration of the company's mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and historical predecessors:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62317", "revid": "5846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62317", "title": "Speex", "text": "Audio compression software\nThe Speex project is an attempt to create a free software speech codec, unencumbered by patent restrictions. Speex is licensed under the BSD License and is used with the Xiph.org Foundation's Ogg container format.\nThe Speex coder uses the Ogg bitstream format, and the Speex designers see their project as complementary to the Vorbis general-purpose audio compression project.\nThe developers of Speex have since 2012 considered it to be obsoleted by Opus.\nDescription.\nUnlike many other speech codecs, Speex is not targeted at cell phones but rather at voice over IP (VoIP) and file-based compression. The design goals have been to make a codec that would allow both very good quality speech and low bit rate, which led to the development of a codec with multiple bit rates. Very good quality also meant the support of wideband ( sampling rate) in addition to narrowband (telephone quality, sampling rate). Designing for VoIP instead of cell phone use means that Speex must be robust to lost packets, but not to corrupted ones since UDP ensures that packets either arrive unaltered or don't arrive. All this led to the choice of Code Excited Linear Prediction (CELP) as the encoding technique to use for Speex. One of the main reasons is that CELP has long proved that it could do the job and scale well to both low bit rates (as evidenced by DoD CELP @ ) and high bit rates (as with G.728 @ ).\nThe main characteristics can be summarized as follows:\nFeature description.\nSampling rate.\nSpeex is mainly designed for 3 different sampling rates: (narrowband), (wideband) and (ultra-wideband).\nQuality.\nSpeex encoding is controlled most of the time by a quality parameter that ranges from 0 to 10. In constant bit-rate (CBR) operation, the quality parameter is an integer, while for variable bit-rate (VBR), the parameter is a float. \nComplexity (variable).\nWith Speex, it is possible to vary the complexity allowed for the encoder. This is done by controlling how the search is performed with an integer ranging from 1 to 10 in a way that's similar to the -1 to -9 options to gzip and bzip2 compression utilities. For normal use, the noise level at complexity 1 is between 1 and 2 dB higher than at complexity 10, but the CPU requirements for complexity 10 is about 5 times higher\nthan for complexity 1. In practice, the best trade-off is between complexity 2 and 4, though higher settings are often useful when encoding non-speech sounds like DTMF tones.\nVariable Bit-Rate (VBR).\nVariable bit-rate (VBR) allows a codec to change its bit rate dynamically to adapt to the \"difficulty\" of the audio being encoded. In the example of Speex, sounds like vowels and high-energy transients require a higher bit rate to achieve good quality, while fricatives (e.g. s and f sounds) can be coded adequately with fewer bits. For this reason, VBR can achieve lower bit rate for the same quality, or a better quality for a certain bit rate. Despite its advantages, VBR has two main drawbacks: first, by only specifying quality, there's no guarantee about the final average bit-rate. Second, for some real-time applications like voice over IP (VoIP), what counts is the maximum bit-rate, which must be low enough for the communication channel.\nAverage Bit-Rate (ABR).\nAverage bit-rate solves one of the problems of VBR, as it dynamically adjusts VBR quality in order to meet a specific target bit-rate. Because the quality/bit-rate is adjusted in real-time (open-loop), the global quality will be slightly lower than that obtained by encoding in VBR with exactly the right quality setting to meet the target average bitrate.\nVoice Activity Detection (VAD).\nWhen enabled, voice activity detection detects whether the audio being encoded is speech or silence/background noise. VAD is always implicitly activated when encoding in VBR, so the option is only useful in non-VBR operation. In this case, Speex detects non-speech periods and encode them with just enough bits to reproduce the background noise. This is called \"comfort noise generation\" (CNG).\nDiscontinuous Transmission (DTX).\nDiscontinuous transmission is an addition to VAD/VBR operation, that allows to stop transmitting completely when the background noise is stationary. In file-based operation, only 5 bits are used for such frames (corresponding to ) since the process that is writing to the file cannot be stopped.\nPerceptual enhancement.\nPerceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when turned on, tries to reduce (the perception of) the noise produced by the coding/decoding process. In most cases, perceptual enhancement makes the sound further from the original objectively (signal-to-noise ratio), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective improvement).\nAlgorithmic delay.\nEvery speech codec introduces a delay in the transmission. For Speex, this delay is equal to the frame size, plus some amount of \"look-ahead\" required to process each frame. In narrowband operation (), the delay is , while for wideband (), the delay is . These values don't account for the CPU time it takes to encode or decode the frames.\nLarge application base.\nThere is already a large base of applications supporting the speex codec, from teleconference software to streaming, P2P, and audio processing applications. Most of these are based on the DirectDS filter, OpenACM codec -- Netmeeting on Microsoft Windows, or OpenH323 on Linux (GnomeMeeting), for example. There are also plugins for the Winamp and XMMS players.\nThe MIME type for Speex is audio/x-speex, although the type audio/speex is proposed.\nExternal links.\n\"This article uses material from the http:// which is copyright (c) Jean-Marc Valin and licensed under the terms of the \""}

{"id": "62319", "revid": "50547993", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62319", "title": "Closure (computer programming)", "text": "Technique for creating lexically scoped first class functions\nIn programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those \"captured variables\" through the closure's copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.\nHistory and etymology.\nThe concept of closures was developed in the 1960s for the mechanical evaluation of expressions in the \u03bb-calculus and was first fully implemented in 1970 as a language feature in the PAL programming language to support lexically scoped first-class functions.\nPeter Landin defined the term \"closure\" in 1964 as having an \"environment part\" and a \"control part\" as used by his SECD machine for evaluating expressions. Joel Moses credits Landin with introducing the term \"closure\" to refer to a lambda expression with open bindings (free variables) that have been closed by (or bound in) the lexical environment, resulting in a \"closed expression\", or closure. This use was subsequently adopted by Sussman and Steele when they defined Scheme in 1975, a lexically scoped variant of Lisp, and became widespread.\nSussman and Abelson also use the term \"closure\" in the 1980s with a second, unrelated meaning: the property of an operator that adds data to a data structure to also be able to add nested data structures. This use of the term comes from mathematics use, rather than the prior use in computer science. The authors consider this overlap in terminology to be \"unfortunate.\"\nAnonymous functions.\nThe term \"closure\" is often used as a synonym for anonymous function, though strictly, an anonymous function is a function literal without a name, while a closure is an instance of a function, a value, whose non-local variables have been bound either to values or storage locations (depending on the language; see the lexical environment section below).\nFor example, in the following Python code:\ndef f(x: int) -&gt; Callable[[int], int]:\n def g(y: int) -&gt; int:\n return x + y\n return g # Return a closure.\ndef h(x: int) -&gt; Callable[[int], int]:\n return lambda y: x + y # Return a closure.\na: Callable[[int], int] = f(1)\nb: Callable[[int], int] = h(1)\nassert a(5) == 6\nassert b(5) == 6\nassert f(1)(5) == 6 # f(1) is the closure.\nassert h(1)(5) == 6 # h(1) is the closure.\nthe values of codice_1 and codice_2 are closures, in both cases produced by returning a [[nested function]] with a free variable from the enclosing function, so that the free variable binds to the value of parameter codice_3 of the enclosing function. The closures in codice_1 and codice_2 are functionally identical. The only difference in implementation is that in the first case we used a nested function with a name, codice_6, while in the second case we used an anonymous nested function (using the Python keyword codice_7 for creating an anonymous function). The original name, if any, used in defining them is irrelevant.\nA closure is a value like any other value. It does not need to be assigned to a variable and can instead be used directly, as shown in the last two lines of the example. This usage may be deemed an \"anonymous closure\".\nThe nested function definitions are not themselves closures: they have a free variable which is not yet bound. Only once the enclosing function is evaluated with a value for the parameter is the free variable of the nested function bound, creating a closure, which is then returned from the enclosing function.\nLastly, a closure is only distinct from a function with free variables when outside of the scope of the non-local variables, otherwise the defining environment and the execution environment coincide and there is nothing to distinguish these (static and dynamic binding cannot be distinguished because the names resolve to the same values). For example, in the program below, functions with a free variable codice_3 (bound to the non-local variable codice_3 with global scope) are executed in the same environment where codice_3 is defined, so it is immaterial whether these are actually closures:\nx: int = 1\nnums: list[int] = [1, 2, 3]\ndef f(y: int) -&gt; int:\n return x + y\nmap(f, nums)\nmap(lambda y: x + y, nums)\nThis is most often achieved by a function return, since the function must be defined within the scope of the non-local variables, in which case typically its own scope will be smaller.\nThis can also be achieved by [[variable shadowing]] (which reduces the scope of the [[non-local variable]]), though this is less common in practice, as it is less useful and shadowing is discouraged. In this example codice_11 can be seen to be a closure because codice_3 in the body of codice_11 is bound to the codice_3 in the global namespace, not the codice_3 local to codice_6:\nx: int = 0\ndef f(y: int) -&gt; int:\n return x + y\ndef g(z: int) -&gt; int:\n x: int = 1 # local x shadows global x\n return f(z)\nprint(g(1))\nApplications.\nThe use of closures is associated with languages where functions are [[first-class object]]s, in which functions can be returned as results from [[higher-order function]]s, or passed as arguments to other function calls; if functions with free variables are first-class, then returning one creates a closure. This includes [[functional programming]] languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]], and many modern, multi-paradigm languages, such as [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], and [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]]. Closures are also often used with [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], particularly for [[event handler]]s, such as in [[JavaScript]], where they are used for interactions with a [[dynamic web page]].\nClosures can also be used in a [[continuation-passing style]] to [[Information hiding|hide state]]. Constructs such as [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[control structure]]s can thus be implemented with closures. In some languages, a closure may occur when a function is defined within another function, and the inner function refers to local variables of the outer function. At [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|run-time]], when the outer function executes, a closure is formed, consisting of the inner function's code and references (the upvalues) to any variables of the outer function required by the closure.\nFirst-class functions.\nClosures typically appear in languages with [[first-class object|first-class functions]]\u2014in other words, such languages enable functions to be passed as arguments, returned from function calls, bound to variable names, etc., just like simpler types such as strings and integers. For example, consider the following [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] function:\n (filter\n (lambda (book)\n (&gt;= (book-sales book) threshold))\n book-list))\nIn this example, the [[Lambda (programming)|lambda expression]] codice_17 appears within the function codice_18. When the lambda expression is evaluated, Scheme creates a closure consisting of the code for the lambda expression and a reference to the codice_19 variable, which is a [[free variable]] inside the lambda expression.\nThe closure is then passed to the codice_20 function, which calls it repeatedly to determine which books are to be added to the result list and which are to be discarded. Because the closure has a reference to codice_19, it can use that variable each time codice_20 calls it. The function codice_20 might be defined in a separate file.\nHere is the same example rewritten in [[JavaScript]], another popular language with support for closures:\n// Return a list of all books with at least 'threshold' copies sold.\nfunction bestSellingBooks(threshold) {\n return bookList.filter(book =&gt; book.sales &gt;= threshold);\nThe arrow operator codice_24 is used to define an https://, and an codice_25 method instead of a global codice_20 function, but otherwise the structure and the effect of the code are the same.\nA function may create a closure and return it, as in this example:\n// Return a function that approximates the derivative of f\n// using an interval of dx, which should be appropriately small.\nfunction derivative(f, dx) {\n return x =&gt; (f(x + dx) - f(x)) / dx;\nBecause the closure in this case outlives the execution of the function that creates it, the variables codice_11 and codice_28 live on after the function codice_29 returns, even though execution has left their scope and they are no longer visible. In languages without closures, the lifetime of an automatic local variable coincides with the execution of the stack frame where that variable is declared. In languages with closures, variables must continue to exist as long as any existing closures have references to them. This is most commonly implemented using some form of [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].\nState representation.\nA closure can be used to associate a function with a set of \"[[Class (programming)|private]]\" variables, which persist over several invocations of the function. The [[scope (programming)|scope]] of the variable encompasses only the closed-over function, so it cannot be accessed from other program code. These are analogous to [[private variable]]s in [[object-oriented programming]], and in fact closures are similar to stateful [[function objects]] (or functors) with a single call-operator method.\nIn stateful languages, closures can thus be used to implement paradigms for state representation and [[information hiding]], since the closure's upvalues (its closed-over variables) are of indefinite [[variable (programming)#Scope and extent|extent]], so a value established in one invocation remains available in the next. Closures used in this way no longer have [[referential transparency]], and are thus no longer [[pure function]]s; nevertheless, they are commonly used in impure functional languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]].\nOther uses.\nClosures have many uses:\n (set! foo (lambda (msg) (set! secret-message msg)))\n (set! bar (lambda () secret-message)))\n(display (bar)) ; prints \"none\"\n(display (bar)) ; prints \"meet me by the docks at midnight\"\nNote: Some speakers call any data structure that binds a [[Scope (programming)#Lexical scoping|lexical]] environment a closure, but the term usually refers specifically to functions.\nImplementation and theory.\nClosures are typically implemented with a special [[data structure]] that contains a [[function pointer|pointer to the function code]], plus a representation of the function's lexical environment (i.e., the set of available variables) at the time when the closure was created. The referencing environment [[name binding|binds]] the non-local names to the corresponding variables in the lexical environment at the time the closure is created, additionally extending their lifetime to at least as long as the lifetime of the closure. When the closure is entered at a later time, possibly with a different lexical environment, the function is executed with its non-local variables referring to the ones captured by the closure, not the current environment.\nA language implementation cannot easily support full closures if its run-time memory model allocates all [[automatic variable]]s on a linear [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack]]. In such languages, a function's automatic local variables are deallocated when the function returns. However, a closure requires that the free variables it references survive the enclosing function's execution. Therefore, those variables must be allocated so that they persist until no longer needed, typically via [[heap allocation]], rather than on the stack, and their lifetime must be managed so they survive until all closures referencing them are no longer in use.\nThis explains why, typically, languages that natively support closures also use [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]. The alternatives are manual memory management of non-local variables (explicitly allocating on the heap and freeing when done), or, if using stack allocation, for the language to accept that certain use cases will lead to [[undefined behaviour]], due to [[dangling pointer]]s to freed automatic variables, as in lambda expressions in C++11 or nested functions in GNU C. The [[funarg problem]] (or \"functional argument\" problem) describes the difficulty of implementing functions as first class objects in a stack-based programming language such as C or C++. Similarly in [[D (programming language)|D]] version 1, it is assumed that the programmer knows what to do with [[delegation (programming)|delegates]] and automatic local variables, as their references will be invalid after return from its definition scope (automatic local variables are on the stack) \u2013 this still permits many useful functional patterns, but for complex cases needs explicit [[heap allocation]] for variables. D version 2 solved this by detecting which variables must be stored on the heap, and performs automatic allocation. Because D uses garbage collection, in both versions, there is no need to track usage of variables as they are passed.\nIn strict functional languages with immutable data (\"e.g.\" [[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]]), it is very easy to implement automatic memory management (garbage collection), as there are no possible cycles in variables' references. For example, in Erlang, all arguments and variables are allocated on the heap, but references to them are additionally stored on the stack. After a function returns, references are still valid. Heap cleaning is done by incremental garbage collector.\nIn ML, local variables are lexically scoped, and hence define a stack-like model, but since they are bound to values and not to objects, an implementation is free to copy these values into the closure's data structure in a way that is invisible to the programmer.\n[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], which has an [[ALGOL]]-like lexical scope system with dynamic variables and garbage collection, lacks a stack programming model and does not suffer from the limitations of stack-based languages. Closures are expressed naturally in Scheme. The lambda form encloses the code, and the free variables of its environment persist within the program as long as they can possibly be accessed, and so they can be used as freely as any other Scheme expression.\nClosures are closely related to Actors in the [[Actor model]] of concurrent computation where the values in the function's lexical environment are called \"acquaintances\". An important issue for closures in [[concurrent programming]] languages is whether the variables in a closure can be updated and, if so, how these updates can be synchronized. Actors provide one solution.\nClosures are closely related to [[function object]]s; the transformation from the former to the latter is known as [[defunctionalization]] or [[lambda lifting]]; see also [[closure conversion]].\nDifferences in semantics.\nLexical environment.\nAs different languages do not always have a common definition of the lexical environment, their definitions of closure may vary also. The commonly held minimalist definition of the lexical environment defines it as a set of all [[Name binding|bindings of variables]] in the scope, and that is also what closures in any language have to capture. However the meaning of a [[Variable (programming)|variable]] binding also differs. In imperative languages, variables bind to relative locations in memory that can store values. Although the relative location of a binding does not change at runtime, the value in the bound location can. In such languages, since closure captures the binding, any operation on the variable, whether done from the closure or not, are performed on the same relative memory location. This is often called capturing the variable \"by reference\". Here is an example illustrating the concept in [[ECMAScript]], which is one such language:\n// Javascript\nvar f, g;\nfunction foo() {\n var x;\n f = function() { return ++x; };\n g = function() { return --x; };\n x = 1;\n alert('inside foo, call to f(): ' + f());\nfoo(); // 2\nalert('call to g(): ' + g()); // 1 (--x)\nalert('call to g(): ' + g()); // 0 (--x)\nalert('call to f(): ' + f()); // 1 (++x)\nalert('call to f(): ' + f()); // 2 (++x)\nFunction codice_30 and the closures referred to by variables codice_11 and codice_6 all use the same relative memory location signified by local variable codice_3.\nIn some instances the above behaviour may be undesirable, and it is necessary to bind a different lexical closure. Again in ECMAScript, this would be done using the codice_34.\nExample 1: Reference to an unbound variable.\nvar module = {\n x: 42,\nvar unboundGetX = module.getX;\nconsole.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope\n// emits undefined as 'x' is not specified in global scope.\nvar boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module); // specify object module as the closure\nconsole.log(boundGetX()); // emits 42\nExample 2: Accidental reference to a bound variable.\nFor this example the expected behaviour would be that each link should emit its id when clicked; but because the variable 'e' is bound to the scope above, and lazy evaluated on click, what actually happens is that each on click event emits the id of the last element in 'elements' bound at the end of the [[for loop]].\nvar elements = document.getElementsByTagName('a');\n// Incorrect: e is bound to the function containing the 'for' loop, not the closure of \"handle\"\nfor (var e of elements) { \n e.onclick = function handle() { \n alert(e.id);\n} \nAgain here variable codice_35 would need to be bound by the scope of the block using codice_36 or the codice_37 keyword.\nOn the other hand, many functional languages, such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], bind variables directly to values. In this case, since there is no way to change the value of the variable once it is bound, there is no need to share the state between closures\u2014they just use the same values. This is often called capturing the variable \"by value\". Java's local and anonymous classes also fall into this category\u2014they require captured local variables to be codice_38, which also means there is no need to share state.\nSome languages enable choosing between capturing the value of a variable or its location. For example, in C++11, captured variables are either declared with codice_39, which means captured by reference, or with codice_40, which means captured by value.\nYet another subset, [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] functional languages such as [[Haskell]], bind variables to results of future computations rather than values. Consider this example in Haskell:\n-- Haskell\nfoo :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)\nfoo x y = (\\z -&gt; z + r)\n where r = x / y\nf :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a\nf = foo 1 0\nmain = print (f 123)\nThe binding of codice_41 captured by the closure defined within function codice_30 is to the computation codice_43\u2014which in this case results in division by zero. However, since it is the computation that is captured, and not the value, the error only manifests when the closure is invoked, and then attempts to use the captured binding.\nClosure leaving.\nYet more differences manifest themselves in the behavior of other lexically scoped constructs, such as codice_44, codice_45 and codice_46 statements. Such constructs can, in general, be considered in terms of invoking an [[escape continuation]] established by an enclosing control statement (in case of codice_45 and codice_46, such interpretation requires looping constructs to be considered in terms of recursive function calls). In some languages, such as ECMAScript, codice_44 refers to the continuation established by the closure lexically innermost with respect to the statement\u2014thus, a codice_44 within a closure transfers control to the code that called it. However, in [[Smalltalk]], the superficially similar operator codice_51 invokes the escape continuation established for the method invocation, ignoring the escape continuations of any intervening nested closures. The escape continuation of a particular closure can only be invoked in Smalltalk implicitly by reaching the end of the closure's code. These examples in ECMAScript and Smalltalk highlight the difference:\n\"Smalltalk\"\nfoo\n | xs |\n xs := #(1 2 3 4).\n xs do: [:x | ^x].\n ^0\nbar\n Transcript show: (self foo printString) \"prints 1\"\n// ECMAScript\nfunction foo() {\n var xs = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n xs.forEach(function (x) { return x; });\n return 0;\nalert(foo()); // prints 0\nThe above code snippets will behave differently because the Smalltalk codice_51 operator and the JavaScript codice_44 operator are not analogous. In the ECMAScript example, codice_54 will leave the inner closure to begin a new iteration of the codice_55 loop, whereas in the Smalltalk example, codice_56 will abort the loop and return from the method codice_30.\n[[Common Lisp]] provides a construct that can express either of the above actions: Lisp codice_58 behaves as [[Smalltalk]] codice_56, while Lisp codice_60 behaves as [[JavaScript]] codice_54. Hence, Smalltalk makes it possible for a captured escape continuation to outlive the extent in which it can be successfully invoked. Consider:\n\"Smalltalk\"\nfoo\n ^[ :x | ^x ]\nbar\n | f |\n f := self foo.\n f value: 123 \"error!\"\nWhen the closure returned by the method codice_30 is invoked, it attempts to return a value from the invocation of codice_30 that created the closure. Since that call has already returned and the Smalltalk method invocation model does not follow the [[spaghetti stack]] discipline to facilitate multiple returns, this operation results in an error.\nSome languages, such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], enable the programmer to choose the way codice_44 is captured. An example in Ruby:\ndef foo\n f.call # control leaves foo here\n return \"return from foo\"\nend\ndef bar\n f.call # control does not leave bar here\n return \"return from bar\"\nend\nputs foo # prints \"return from foo from inside proc\"\nputs bar # prints \"return from bar\"\nBoth codice_65 and codice_7 in this example are ways to create a closure, but semantics of the closures thus created are different with respect to the codice_44 statement.\nIn [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], definition and scope of the codice_44 control statement is explicit (and only arbitrarily named 'return' for the sake of the example). The following is a direct translation of the Ruby sample.\n (call/cc\n (lambda (return)\n (define (f) (return \"return from foo from inside proc\"))\n (f) ; control leaves foo here\n (return \"return from foo\"))))\n (call/cc\n (lambda (return)\n (define (f) (call/cc (lambda (return) (return \"return from lambda\"))))\n (f) ; control does not leave bar here\n (return \"return from bar\"))))\n(display (foo)) ; prints \"return from foo from inside proc\"\n(display (bar)) ; prints \"return from bar\"\nClosure-like constructs.\nSome languages have features which simulate the behavior of closures. In languages such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Objective-C]], and [[Visual Basic (.NET)]] (VB.NET), these features are the result of the language's object-oriented paradigm.\nCallbacks (C).\nSome [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries support [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]]. This is sometimes implemented by providing two values when registering the callback with the library: a function pointer and a separate codice_69 pointer to arbitrary data of the user's choice. When the library executes the callback function, it passes along the data pointer. This enables the callback to maintain state and to refer to information captured at the time it was registered with the library. The idiom is similar to closures in functionality, but not in syntax. The codice_69 pointer is not [[Type safety|type safe]] so this C idiom differs from type-safe closures in C#, Haskell or ML.\nCallbacks are used extensively in [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) [[widget toolkit]]s to implement [[event-driven programming]] by associating general functions of graphical widgets (menus, buttons, check boxes, sliders, spinners, etc.) with application-specific functions implementing the specific desired behavior for the application.\nNested function and function pointer (C).\nWith a [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) extension, a nested function can be used and a function pointer can emulate closures, provided the function does not exit the containing scope. The next example is invalid because codice_71 is a top-level definition (depending on compiler version, it could produce a correct result if compiled with no optimizing, i.e., at codice_72):\ntypedef int (*FnIntToInt)(int); // type of function int-&gt;int\nFnIntToInt adder(int number) {\n return &amp;add; // &amp; operator is optional here because the name of a function in C is a pointer pointing on itself\nint main(void) {\n FnIntToInt add10 = adder(10);\n printf(\"%d\\n\", add10(1));\n return 0;\nBut moving codice_71 (and, optionally, the codice_74) in codice_75 makes it valid:\ntypedef int (*FnIntToInt)(int); // type of function int-&gt;int\nint main(void) { \n FnIntToInt adder(int number) {\n int add (int value) { \n return value + number; \n return add;\n \n FnIntToInt add10 = adder(10);\n printf(\"%d\\n\", add10(1));\n return 0;\nIf executed this now prints codice_76 as expected.\nLocal classes and lambda functions (Java).\n[[Java (programming language)|Java]] enables [[Class (programming)|classes]] to be defined inside [[method (object-oriented programming)|methods]]. These are called \"local classes\". When such classes are not named, they are known as \"[[anonymous class]]es\" (or anonymous \"inner\" classes). A local class (either named or anonymous) may refer to names in lexically enclosing classes, or read-only variables (marked as codice_38) in the lexically enclosing method.\nclass CalculationWindow extends JFrame {\n private volatile int result;\n public void calculateInSeparateThread(final URI uri) {\n // The expression \"new Runnable() { ... }\" is an anonymous class implementing the 'Runnable' interface.\n new Thread(\n new Runnable() {\n void run() {\n // It can read final local variables:\n calculate(uri);\n // It can access private fields of the enclosing class:\n result = result + 10;\n ).start();\nThe capturing of codice_38 variables enables capturing variables by value. Even if the variable to capture is non-codice_38, it can always be copied to a temporary codice_38 variable just before the class.\nCapturing of variables by reference can be emulated by using a codice_38 reference to a mutable container, for example, a one-element array. The local class will not be able to change the value of the container reference, but it will be able to change the contents of the container.\nWith the advent of Java 8's lambda expressions, the closure causes the above code to be executed as:\nclass CalculationWindow extends JFrame {\n private volatile int result;\n public void calculateInSeparateThread(final URI uri) {\n // The code () -&gt; { /* code */ } is a closure.\n new Thread(() -&gt; {\n calculate(uri);\n result = result + 10;\n }).start();\nLocal classes are one of the types of [[inner class]] that are declared within the body of a method. Java also supports inner classes that are declared as \"non-static members\" of an enclosing class. They are normally referred to just as \"inner classes\". These are defined in the body of the enclosing class and have full access to instance variables of the enclosing class. Due to their binding to these instance variables, an inner class may only be instantiated with an explicit binding to an instance of the enclosing class using a special syntax.\npublic class EnclosingClass {\n /* Define the inner class */\n public class InnerClass {\n public int incrementAndReturnCounter() {\n return counter++;\n private int counter;\n counter = 0;\n public int getCounter() {\n return counter;\n public static void main(String[] args) {\n EnclosingClass enclosingClassInstance = new EnclosingClass();\n /* Instantiate the inner class, with binding to the instance */\n EnclosingClass.InnerClass innerClassInstance =\n enclosingClassInstance.new InnerClass();\n for (int i = enclosingClassInstance.getCounter();\n (i = innerClassInstance.incrementAndReturnCounter()) &lt; 10;\n /* increment step omitted */) {\n System.out.println(i);\nUpon execution, this will print the integers from 0 to 9. Beware to not confuse this type of class with the nested class, which is declared in the same way with an accompanied usage of the \"static\" modifier; those have not the desired effect but are instead just classes with no special binding defined in an enclosing class.\nAs of [[Java version history#Java_8|Java 8]], Java supports functions as first class objects. Lambda expressions of this form are considered of type codice_82 with T being the domain and U the image type. The expression can be called with its codice_83 method, but not with a standard method call.\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; length = s -&gt; s.length();\n System.out.println(length.apply(\"Hello, world!\")); // Will print 13.\nBlocks (C, C++, Objective-C 2.0).\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced [[Blocks (C language extension)|blocks]], a form of closure, as a nonstandard extension into [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Objective-C 2.0]] and in [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard|Mac OS X 10.6 \"Snow Leopard\"]] and [[iOS 4]].0. Apple made their implementation available for the GCC and clang compilers.\nPointers to block and block literals are marked with codice_51. Normal local variables are captured by value when the block is created, and are read-only inside the block. Variables to be captured by reference are marked with codice_85. Blocks that need to persist outside of the scope they are created in may need to be copied.\ntypedef int (^IntBlock)();\nIntBlock downCounter(int start) {\n __block int i = start;\n return [[ ^int() {\n return i--;\n } copy] autorelease];\nIntBlock f = downCounter(5);\nNSLog(@\"%d\", f());\nNSLog(@\"%d\", f());\nNSLog(@\"%d\", f());\nDelegates (C#, VB.NET, D).\n[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] anonymous methods and lambda expressions support closure:\nint[] data = new[]{1, 2, 3, 4};\nint multiplier = 2;\nList&lt;int&gt; result = data.Select(x =&gt; x * multiplier);\n[[Visual Basic .NET]], which has many language features similar to those of C#, also supports lambda expressions with closures:\nDim multiplier = 2\nDim result = data.Select(Function(x) x * multiplier)\nIn [[D (programming language)|D]], closures are implemented by delegates, a function pointer paired with a context pointer (e.g. a class instance, or a stack frame on the heap in the case of closures).\nauto test1() {\n int a = 7;\n return delegate() { return a + 3; }; // anonymous delegate construction\nauto test2() {\n int a = 20;\n int foo() { return a + 5; } // inner function\n return &amp;foo; // other way to construct delegate\nvoid bar() {\n auto dg = test1();\n dg(); // =10 // ok, test1.a is in a closure and still exists\n dg = test2();\n dg(); // =25 // ok, test2.a is in a closure and still exists\nD version 1, has limited closure support. For example, the above code will not work correctly, because the variable a is on the stack, and after returning from test(), it is no longer valid to use it (most probably calling foo via dg(), will return a 'random' integer). This can be solved by explicitly allocating the variable 'a' on heap, or using structs or class to store all needed closed variables and construct a delegate from a method implementing the same code. Closures can be passed to other functions, as long as they are only used while the referenced values are still valid (for example calling another function with a closure as a callback parameter), and are useful for writing generic data processing code, so this limitation, in practice, is often not an issue.\nThis limitation was fixed in D version 2 - the variable 'a' will be automatically allocated on the heap because it is used in the inner function, and a delegate of that function can escape the current scope (via assignment to dg or return). Any other local variables (or arguments) that are not referenced by delegates or that are only referenced by delegates that do not escape the current scope, remain on the stack, which is simpler and faster than heap allocation. The same is true for inner's class methods that reference a function's variables.\nFunction objects (C++).\n[[C++]] enables defining [[function object]]s by overloading codice_86. These objects behave somewhat like functions in a functional programming language. They may be created at runtime and may contain state, but they do not implicitly capture local variables as closures do. As of [[C++11|the 2011 revision]], the C++ language also supports closures, which are a type of function object constructed automatically from a special [[language construct]] called \"lambda-expression\". A C++ closure may capture its context either by storing copies of the accessed variables as members of the closure object or by reference. In the latter case, if the closure object escapes the scope of a referenced object, invoking its codice_86 causes undefined behavior since C++ closures do not extend the lifetime of their context.\nimport std;\nusing std::string;\nusing std::vector;\nvoid foo(std::string&amp; myName) {\n int n = 100;\n vector&lt;string&gt; v;\n // i is of type vector&lt;string&gt;::iterator\n auto i = std::ranges::find_if(v, [&amp;](const string&amp; s) -&gt; bool { return s != name &amp;&amp; s.size() &gt; n; }); \n // 'i' is now either 'v.end()' or points to the first string in 'v'\n // which is not equal to 'name' and whose length is greater than 'n'\nC++ also has the object codice_88 for holding an anonymous function. However, because anonymous functions have compiler-generated names and are distinct, storing one as a codice_89 uses type erasure which causes minor overhead.\nInline agents (Eiffel).\n[[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] includes inline agents defining closures. An inline agent is an object representing a routine, defined by giving the code of the routine in-line. For example, in\nok_button.click_event.subscribe (\n agent (x, y: INTEGER) do\n map.country_at_coordinates (x, y).display\n end\nthe argument to codice_90 is an agent, representing a procedure with two arguments; the procedure finds the country at the corresponding coordinates and displays it. The whole agent is \"subscribed\" to the event type codice_91 for a\ncertain button, so that whenever an instance of the event type occurs on that button \u2013 because a user has clicked the button \u2013 the procedure will be executed with the mouse coordinates being passed as arguments for codice_3 and codice_93.\nThe main limitation of Eiffel agents, which distinguishes them from closures in other languages, is that they cannot reference local variables from the enclosing scope. This design decision helps in avoiding ambiguity when talking about a local variable value in a closure - should it be the latest value of the variable or the value captured when the agent is created? Only codice_94 (a reference to current object, analogous to codice_95 in Java), its features, and arguments of the agent can be accessed from within the agent body. The values of the outer local variables can be passed by providing additional closed operands to the agent.\nC++Builder __closure reserved word.\nEmbarcadero C++Builder provides the reserved word codice_96 to provide a pointer to a method with a similar syntax to a function pointer.\nStandard C allows writing a [[typedef]] for a pointer to a [[function type]] using the following syntax:\ntypedef void (*TMyFunctionPointer)( void );\nIn a similar way, a typedef can be declared for a pointer to a method using this syntax:\ntypedef void (__closure *TMyMethodPointer)();\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n[[Category:Programming language concepts]]\n[[Category:Implementation of functional programming languages]]\n[[Category:Subroutines]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C++ code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example C Sharp code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example D code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Eiffel code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Haskell code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Java code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example JavaScript code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Objective-C code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Python (programming language) code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Ruby code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Scheme (programming language) code]]\n[[Category:Articles with example Smalltalk code]]"}
{"id": "62320", "revid": "49887303", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62320", "title": "Samwise Gamgee", "text": "Hobbit character in The Lord of the Rings\nSamwise Gamgee (, usually called Sam) (Westron: \"Banaz\u00eer Galbasi\") is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth. A hobbit, Samwise is the chief supporting character of \"The Lord of the Rings\", serving as the loyal companion of the protagonist Frodo Baggins. Sam is a member of the Company of the Ring, the group of nine charged with destroying the One Ring.\nSam was Frodo's gardener. He was drawn into Frodo's adventure while eavesdropping on a private conversation Frodo was having with the wizard Gandalf. Sam was Frodo's steadfast companion and servant, portrayed as both physically strong for his size and emotionally strong, often supporting Frodo through difficult parts of the journey and, at times, carrying Frodo when he was too weak to go on. Sam served as Ring-bearer for a short time when Frodo was captured by orcs; his emotional strength was again demonstrated when he willingly gave the Ring back to Frodo. Following the War of the Ring, Sam returned to the Shire and his role as a gardener, helping to replant the trees which had been destroyed while he was away. He was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive terms.\nThe name Gamgee derives from a local Birmingham name for cotton wool, from a surgical dressing invented by Sampson Gamgee; hence Sam's girlfriend Rosie is from the Cotton family. Scholars have remarked on the symbolism in Sam's story, which carries echoes of Christianity; for instance, his carrying of Frodo is reminiscent of Simon of Cyrene's carrying of Christ's cross. Tolkien considered Sam a hero of the story. Psychologists have seen Sam's quest as a psychological journey of love. Tolkien's biographers have noted the resemblance of Sam's relationship with Frodo to that of military servants to British Army officers in the First World War.\nFictional biography.\nThe War of the Ring.\nAs told in \"The Lord of the Rings\", Samwise Gamgee is Frodo Baggins's gardener, having inherited the position from his father, Hamfast \"Gaffer\" Gamgee, who was Bilbo Baggins's gardener. As \"punishment\" for eavesdropping on Gandalf's conversation with Frodo about the One Ring, Sam is made Frodo's first companion on his journey to Rivendell. They are joined by Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, Frodo's cousins, travelling together to Rivendell. At the Council of Elrond there, Sam joins the Fellowship of the Ring. In the elvish land of Lothl\u00f3rien, Galadriel gives Sam a small box of earth from her garden.\nWhen the Fellowship splits up at the Falls of Rauros, Sam insists on accompanying Frodo. Sam protects and cares for Frodo, who is growing weaker under the Ring's influence, as they move through the dangerous lands toward Mordor. Sam distrusts Gollum, who became their guide into Mordor, leading them through the Dead Marshes. His suspicions are confirmed in the mountain pass of Cirith Ungol, where Gollum betrays them to the giant spider Shelob. Shelob stings Frodo, and Sam drives her off. A band of orcs approaches; Sam chooses to leave the apparently dead Frodo and take the Ring himself, and briefly becomes the Ring-bearer. He is momentarily tempted by the Ring's promise of power, but does not succumb to it. Sam then rescues Frodo (who had only been paralysed) from the Orcs who held him captive. Sam returns the ring to Frodo. The two journey through Mordor and into Mount Doom. Sam carries Frodo on his back for some of the way. Gollum attacks Frodo and reclaims the Ring, only to destroy both it and himself by falling into one of the Cracks of Doom.\nThe Scouring of the Shire.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n So Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. He went up and down the Shire in this labour; but if he paid special attention to Hobbiton and Bywater no one blamed him. ...\u00a0\u00a0Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, as if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty. In the Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in April. It was indeed a \"mallorn\", and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood.\n \"The Lord of the Rings\", book 6, ch. 9 \"The Grey Havens\"\nThe hobbits return home horrified to find the Shire under the control of \"Sharkey\" (Saruman) and his ruffians who had wantonly felled trees and despoiled the villages; the hobbits defeat them at the Battle of Bywater and scour the Shire of all the ruffians and their works. Sam travels the length and breadth of the Shire replanting trees, using the elf-queen Galadriel's gift of earth from her garden, and one seed of the elvish mallorn tree, which he plants at Hobbiton. The saplings grow at an astonishing rate.\nIn the Fourth Age.\nSam marries Rosie Cotton and moves into Bag End with Frodo. The next year they have a daughter, Elanor, the first of their thirteen children. Frodo tells Sam that he (Frodo) and Bilbo will leave Middle-earth, along with Gandalf and most of the remaining High Elves, for the Undying Lands. Frodo gives Sam the estate of Bag End, and the \"Red Book of Westmarch\" for Sam to continue, hinting that Sam may also be allowed to travel into the West eventually. Sam returns to meet his family at Bag End, ending the story with the words \"Well, I'm back.\"\nThe Appendices note that in the year 1427 of the Shire Reckoning, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for the first of seven consecutive seven-year terms. His descendants took the surname Gardner in his honour.\nAnalysis.\nChristianity.\nTolkien intentionally avoided making Christianity explicit in his Middle-earth writings, choosing instead to allow \"the story and the symbolism\" to convey his meaning. Frodo finds the Ring a crushing weight, just as the cross was for Jesus. Sam, who carries Frodo up to Mount Doom, parallels Simon of Cyrene, who helps Jesus by carrying his cross to Golgotha. Sam gains prominence as he is willing to be unimportant in doing his duty, echoing the Christian emphasis on the humble. The ordeal of crossing Mordor, too, reflects the Christian theme of redemptive suffering.\nHeroism.\nTolkien called Sam the \"chief hero\" of the saga, adding: \"I think the simple 'rustic' love of Sam and his Rosie (nowhere elaborated) is absolutely essential to the study of his (the chief hero's) character, and to the theme of the relation of ordinary life (breathing, eating, working, begetting) and quests, sacrifice, causes, and the 'longing for Elves', and sheer beauty.\" Tolkien admired heroism out of loyalty and love, but despised arrogance, pride and wilfulness. The courage and loyalty displayed by Samwise Gamgee on his journey with Frodo is the kind of spirit that Tolkien praised in his essays on the Old English poem \"The Battle of Maldon\". Likewise, Sam's rejection of the Ring is a rejection of power, but also a \"desire for renown which the defeat over Sauron will bring\".\nTom Shippey notes Sam's courage, which among other things takes the form of \"be[ing] 'cheerful' without any hope at all\". Shippey comments that this may hardly appear sensible, but it \"rings true\", appearing in old soldiers' recollections of the First World War. He notes the etymology of \"cheer\", from Old French \"chair\", meaning \"face\", commenting that \"a stout pretence\" is better than \"sincere despair\". Further, in the grimness of the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, he and Frodo imagine people \"laughing at grief\", something that Shippey calls Tolkien's \"new model of courage\".\nPsychological journey.\nThe Jungian clinical psychologist Robin Robertson describes Sam's quest as a psychological journey of love (for Frodo), where Frodo's quest is one of transcendence. Robertson writes that \"Sam's is the simplest yet the most touching of all paths: his simple loyalty and love for Frodo make him the single person who never wavers in his task throughout the book.\" In his view, Sam always stays grounded in simple things like meals and the glory of a sunrise, while Sam ends as the happiest of the Fellowship, having seen the Elves, served as Frodo's companion on the quest, and back in the Shire that he loves, marries Rosie and is blessed with many children.\nThe Jungian analyst Pia Skogemann views Sam as standing for one of the four cognitive functions, namely feeling, with the other three assigned to the other hobbits in the Fellowship: Frodo stands for thinking, Pippin for intuition, and Merry for sensation.\nRelationship with Frodo.\nDuring the journey to destroy the Ring, Sam's relationship with Frodo exemplifies that of a military servant or batman to his assigned officer in the British Army, in particular in the First World War in which Tolkien had served as an officer, with different batmen at different times. His biographer John Garth stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTolkien wrote in a private letter: \"My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflexion of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognised as so far superior to myself.\" and elsewhere: \"Sam was cocksure, and deep down a little conceited; but his conceit had been transformed by his devotion to Frodo. He did not think of himself as heroic or even brave, or in any way admirable \u2013 except in his service and loyalty to his master.\"\nAlthough Tolkien does not explicitly say so, Sam is in effect Frodo's self-appointed manservant, carrying out more mundane chores thus relieving his \"master\" of the necessity to do so, the term being used in (for example) Ishay Landa's essay \"Slaves of the Ring: Tolkien's Political Unconscious\". Tolkien himself gets closest to this terminology, possibly inadvertently, when in the account \"Of The Rings of Power\" in \"The Simarillion\" he writes: \"For Frodo the Halfling, it is said, at the bidding of Mithrandir took on himself the burden [of destroying the One Ring], and alone with his servant he passed through peril and darkness and came at last in Sauron's despite even to Mount Doom; and there into the Fire where it was wrought he cast the Great Ring of Power, and so at last it was unmade and its evil consumed.\"\nName.\nTolkien states in his \"Guide to the Names in \"The Lord of the Rings\"\" for translators of the book that he took the name \"Gamgee\" from a colloquial word in Birmingham for cotton wool. This came from Gamgee Tissue, a surgical dressing invented by the 19th-century Birmingham surgeon Sampson Gamgee. He claimed to have been genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in \"The Lord of the Rings\" but had not read the book. Tolkien replied politely and sent Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. He recorded in his journal \"For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed 'S. Gollum'. That would have been more difficult to deal with.\"\nIn the fiction, Tolkien pretends that Sam's name is translated from the Westron \"Banaz\u00eer Galbasi\". The forename comes from elements meaning \"halfwise\" or \"simple\", exactly matching the Old English \"Samw\u00eds\". \"Galbasi\" comes from the name of the village \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Galabas\". This uses the elements \"galab-\", meaning \"game\", and \"bas-\", roughly matching the English placename endings \"-wich\" or \"-wick\" (meaning in Old English a dwelling or specialised farm). In his frame story role as \"translator\" of the \"Red Book of Westmarch\", Tolkien devised a strict English translation, \"Samw\u00eds Gamwich\", which develops into \"Samwise Gammidgy\" and eventually comes to \"Samwise Gamgee\" in modern English. \nTolkien states in a letter that \"Since Sam was close friends of the family of Cotton (another village-name), I was led astray into the Hobbit-like joke of spelling Gamwichy [as] Gamgee, though I do not think that in actual Hobbit-dialect the joke really arose\", i.e. he was punning on the connected meanings in English of the Gamgee and Cotton family names, \"cotton wool\" and \"cotton [fabric]\".\nAdaptations.\nIn the 1971 Mind's Eye radio adaptation, Sam was voiced by Lou Bliss.\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated version of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Sam was voiced by Michael Scholes.\nIn the 1980 animated version of \"The Return of the King\", made for television, the character was voiced by Roddy McDowall.\nIn the 1981 BBC radio adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Sam was played by Bill Nighy.\nIn the 1993 Finnish television miniseries \"Hobitit\", Sam is portrayed by Pertti Sveholm.\nIn the Peter Jackson movies ' (2001), ' (2002) and \"\" (2003), Sam was played by Sean Astin. The batman relationship and class differences between Sam and Frodo are somewhat subdued, though Sam still refers to Frodo as \"Mr.\" (but not \"Master\"). \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Sam Gamgee one of the \"greatest sidekicks.\" UGO Networks named Sam as one of their top heroes in entertainment.\nOn stage, Sam was portrayed by Peter Howe in the Toronto stage production of \"The Lord of the Rings\", which opened in 2006. In the United States, Sam was portrayed by Blake Bowden in the Cincinnati productions of \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" (2001), \"The Two Towers\" (2002), and \"The Return of the King\" (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62321", "revid": "11555324", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62321", "title": "Cloture", "text": "Parliamentary procedure forcing a quick end to a debate\nCloture (, ), closure or, informally, a guillotine, is a motion or process in parliamentary procedure aimed at bringing debate to a quick end.\nThe cloture procedure originated in the French National Assembly, from which the name is taken. is French for \"the act of terminating something\".\nIt was introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom by William Ewart Gladstone to overcome the obstructionism of the Irish Parliamentary Party and was made permanent in 1887.\nIt was subsequently adopted by the United States Senate and other legislatures. The name \"cloture\" remains in the United States. In Commonwealth countries it is usually \"closure\" or, informally, \"guillotine\". In the United Kingdom and Canada \"closure\" and \"guillotine\" are distinct motions.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the procedure by which finite debating times for particular bills are set, or protracted debates are brought to a close, is referred to as a \"guillotine\" or \u201cgag\u201d. Generally, a minister will declare that a bill must be considered as urgent, and move a motion to limit debating time. The declaration and motion may refer to a single bill, or to multiple bills or packages of bills. A guillotine motion may not be debated or amended, and must be put to a vote immediately.\nCanada.\nAfter a number of occasions where the opposition managed to delay or prevent passage of government bills, closure in Canada was adopted by the House of Commons in 1913 on the motion of Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden. The new closure rule was used by the government only a few days later, during debate at the Committee of the Whole stage of the Naval Aid Bill. Between 1913 and 1932, closure was invoked 11 times. It was used next time in 1956 during the passage of a bill to establish the Northern Ontario Pipeline Crown Corporation. \"Closure\" is the term used in Canada; \"cloture\" and \"guillotine\" are not used. Closure was used to force the adoption of a single red maple leaf flag design on December 15, 1964.\nProcedure on closure in Canada is governed under Standing Order no. 57 of the House of Commons and consists of three parts: Notice of closure, a motion of closure, and a final period of debate before final voting on the bill being closured.\nNotice of closure is an oral statement announcing intention to call for closure given by any Minister at a prior sitting of the Committee of the Whole. The notice need not be the day immediately prior to the sitting at which the bill will be closured, but cannot be in the same sitting as the final motion of closure.\nThe motion of closure, referred to as a motion \"that the debate shall not be further adjourned\", is passed by a simple majority of the House of Commons, although in the event of a tie, the Speaker of the House will apply Speaker Denison's rule to issue the casting vote.\nShould the motion of closure pass, all members are given a single period in which to speak lasting no more than 20 minutes. If the final period of speaking to the bill has not been finished by 8:00\u00a0p.m. that same day, no MP may speak after that point, and the bill moves to a final vote.\nTime allocation.\nA time allocation schedules the stages that a bill goes through. It also for much more specific control over the legislative process than closure, it can control the exact amount of time spent on each step of the legislative process. Time allocation is also known as guillotine. \nHong Kong.\nThe first cloture in Hong Kong was introduced in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on 17 May 2012, by Tsang Yok-sing (President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong), to abruptly halt filibuster during debate at the Committee of the Whole stage of the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012. The motion to end debate was submitted by Council member Philip Wong Yu-hong some time after 4 am Hong Kong time, after a marathon session that lasted over 33 hours. Wong stood up and suggested that legislatures in other countries have a procedure called \"cloture motion\", and suggested Council President should end debate immediately. \nPresident Tsang agreed and said that he considered ending debate even without Wong's suggestion because he would not allow debate to go on endlessly. Cloture is not defined by any rule or precedent of the Legislative Council. Tsang made reference to Standing Order 92, which stated \"In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures\". \nStanding Order 92 therefore may implicitly give Council President discretion on whether he should or should not follow the cloture rules of other legislatures, but this is up to debate. Legislative Council President Tsang chose to end debate without calling for a cloture vote, which is questionable. Council member Leung Kwok-hung then stood up and said that he had never heard of cloture without a vote anywhere else and suggested there should have been a cloture vote.\nCloture was again invoked by Tsang Yok-sing on 13 May 2013 to halt debate of the 2013 Appropriation Bill.\nNew Zealand.\nIn the New Zealand House of Representatives, any MP called to speak may move a closure motion. If the length of the debate is not fixed by standing orders or the Business Committee, the Speaker may decide to put the closure motion to a vote, which is carried by a simple majority.\nUnited Kingdom.\nProcedures.\nA \"closure motion\" may be adopted to end debate on a matter both in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords by a simple majority of those voting. In the House of Commons, at least 100 MPs (not counting two acting as tellers) must vote in favour of the motion for closure to be adopted; the Speaker of the House of Commons may choose to deny the closure motion, if insufficient debate has occurred, or that the procedure is being used to violate the rights of the minority. \nIn the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker does not possess an equivalent power. He must read a statement stating the motion should only be used in exceptional circumstances, and then asks the member if they wish to persist with moving it. If they do, then the motion is put immediately without debate. Only one closure motion is permitted per debate.\nSpecific to legislation, a \"guillotine motion\", formally an \"allocation of time motion\", limits the amount of time for a particular stage of a bill. Debate ceases when the allotted time expires. A single vote is taken immediately to pass the stage of the bill and, in the case of a committee stage or report stage, to accept all undebated sections and government amendments. The use of guillotines has been replaced by the \"programme motion\", where the amount of time for each stage is agreed after a bill's second reading. Both guillotine motions and programme motions are specific to the Commons. The Lords does not permit time restrictions.\nHistory.\nOn 24 January 1881, the second Gladstone ministry attempted to move the first reading of the Protection of Person and Property Bill, a controversial response to the Irish agrarian disturbances known as the Land War. The Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under Charles Stewart Parnell responded with the most extreme example of its policy of obstructionism by filibuster. After two sittings lasting 22 hours and then 41 hours, the Speaker of the Commons, Henry Brand simply refused to recognise any further IPP MPs wishing to speak. In the early hours of 2 February 1881 he put the motion, which was passed. The IPP MPs objected that this was an abuse by the speaker of their rights as members. The government responded by formalising the process as an amendment to the standing orders, moved by Gladstone on 3 February 1881:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That, if upon Notice given a Motion be made by a Minister of the Crown that the state of Public Business is urgent, and if on the call of the Speaker 40 Members shall support it by rising in their places, the Speaker shall forthwith put the Question, no Debate, Amendment, or Adjournment being allowed; and if, on the voices being given he shall without doubt perceive that the Noes have it, his decision shall not be challenged, but, if otherwise, a Division may be forthwith taken, and if the Question be resolved in the affirmative by a majority of not less than three to one, the powers of the House for the Regulation of its Business upon the several stages of Bills, and upon Motions and all other matters, shall be and remain with the Speaker, until the Speaker shall declare that the state of Public Business is no longer urgent, or until the House shall so determine upon a Motion, which after Notice given may be made by any Member, put without Amendment, Adjournment, or Debate, and decided by a majority\nGladstone described it as \"a subject of considerable novelty, and of the extremest gravity\", and many Irish members objected and were suspended from the House before the amendment motion was moved.\nIn 1882, Gladstone proposed a major overhaul of the rules of procedure. On 20 February debate began on the first resolution, on \"putting the question\". The session beginning in November 1882 was devoted entirely to the new rules. The motion on putting the question was passed, after 19 days' debate, on 10 November 1882:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThat when it shall appear to Mr. Speaker, or to the Chairman of Ways and Means in a Committee of the whole House, during any Debate, that the subject has been adequately discussed, and that it is the evident sense of the House, or of the Committee, that the Question be now put, he may so inform the House or the Committee; and, if a Motion be made \"That the Question be now put\", Mr. Speaker, or the Chairman, shall forthwith put such Question; and, if the same be decided in the affirmative, the Question under discussion shall be put forthwith: Provided that the Question, \"That the Question be now put\", shall not be decided in the affirmative, if a Division be taken, unless it shall appear to have been supported by more than two hundred Members, or unless it shall appear to have been opposed by less than forty Members and supported by more than one hundred Members.\nThe rule was invoked only twice by Gladstone's ministry, and the second Salisbury ministry secured its amendment, after six days' debate, on 1 March 1887:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That, after a Question has been proposed, a Motion may be made, if the consent of the Chair has been previously obtained, \"That the Question be now put\". Such Motion shall be put forthwith, and decided without Amendment or Debate: When the Motion \"That the Question be now put\", has been carried, and the Question consequent thereon has been decided, any further Motion may be made (the consent of the Chair having been previously obtained) which, may be requisite to bring to a decision any Question already proposed from the Chair; and also if a Clause be then under consideration, a Motion may be made (with the consent of the Chair as aforesaid) That the Question, That the Clause stand part, or be added to the Bill, be now put. Such Motions shall be put forthwith, and decided without Amendment or Debate: Provided always, That Questions for the Closure of Debate shall not be decided in the affirmative, if a Division be taken, unless it shall appear by the numbers declared from the Chair, that such Motion was supported by more than Two Hundred Members, or was opposed by less than Forty Members, and supported by more than One Hundred Members\nBy 1909, the closure was applicable in committees and to motions as well as in the house and to bills.\nIn 2000, the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons recommended discontinuing the use of allocation of time motions for bills, and instead passing a programme motion to make a programme order. This was accepted by the Commons on 7 November 2000. One of the Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition's most significant parliamentary defeats was in 2012, on the programme motion for the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012. Some rebel MPs agreed with the substance of the bill but felt not enough time had been allocated to its debate.\nUnited States.\nHistory.\nOn 8 March 1917, during World War I, a rule allowing cloture of debate was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 76\u20133 at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare. This effort was led by Republican Senators Henry Cabot Lodge and Charles Curtis. This was successfully invoked for the first time on 15 November 1919, during the 66th Congress, to end a filibuster on the Treaty of Versailles.\nThe Senate's rules originally required a supermajority of two-thirds of all senators present and voting to invoke cloture. For example, if all 100 senators voted on a cloture motion, 67 affirmative votes were required to invoke cloture. If some senators were absent and only 80 senators voted, only 54 would have to vote in favor. In the early years of the cloture rule, it proved very difficult to achieve this. The Senate tried 11 times between 1927 and 1962 to invoke cloture, but failed each time. Filibuster use was particularly heavy by Democratic senators from southern states to block civil rights legislation.\nIn 1975, the Democratic Senate majority, having achieved a net gain of four seats in the 1974 Senate elections to attain a strength of 61 (with an additional independent senator caucusing with them for a total of 62), reduced the necessary supermajority to three-fifths of senators duly chosen and sworn. In practice, most bills cannot become law without the support of 60 senators.\nUnder the Senate rules and precedents, certain questions are nondebatable or debate time on them is limited, most notably bills considered under the reconciliation procedure or joint resolutions providing for congressional disapproval. Therefore, these measures cannot be filibustered and are not subjected to the supermajority cloture threshold. Although filing cloture on nondebatable measures is redundant, it has been done on occasion.\nOn November 21, 2013, after many of President Barack Obama's nominees had been filibustered (most notably, Republicans refused to confirm any nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), Majority Leader Harry Reid raised a point of order that the threshold for invoking cloture on nominations, other than those to the Supreme Court of the United States, is a simple majority. The presiding officer overruled the point of order. The ruling of the chair was overruled by the Senate by a vote of 48\u201352, with all Republicans, as well as Democratic Senators Carl Levin, Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor, voting in favor of sustaining the decision of the chair. \nOn April 6, 2017, following the filibuster of Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised a point of order that the 2013 precedent also applied to Supreme Court nominations. The presiding officer overruled the point of order. The ruling of the chair was overturned by the Senate by a vote of 48\u201352, with all Democrats voting to sustain the decision of the chair. As a result of these two precedents, the threshold for invoking cloture on nominations is now a simple majority.\nIn the United States House of Representatives, the equivalent motion is the previous question.\nProcedure.\nThe procedure for invoking cloture is as follows:\nAfter cloture is invoked, the Senate automatically proceeds to consider the measure on which cloture was invoked (if it was not before the Senate already).\nThe following restrictions apply:\nUnder rule XXII, paragraph 3, added in January 2013, a cloture motion signed by 16 senators (including the majority leader, minority leader, 7 other majority senators and 7 other minority senators) presented on a motion to proceed ripens one hour after the Senate convenes on the following calendar day. If cloture is invoked, the motion to proceed is not debatable.\nUnder rule XXVIII, paragraph 2, added in January 2013, a cloture motion on a compound motion to go to conference ripens two hours after it is filed. If cloture is invoked, the compound motion is not debatable.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tolkien's Middle-earth\nRivendell (\"\") is a valley in J. R. R. Tolkien's fictional world of Middle-earth, representing both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical Elvish otherworld. It is an important location in \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", being the place where the quest to destroy the One Ring begins.\nRivendell's feeling of peace may have contributed to the popularity of \"The Lord of the Rings\" during the war-troubled 1960s. Scholars have noted that Rivendell is the home of Elvish song, from the hymn to Elbereth, recalling Tolkien's Catholicism, to the complex Song of E\u00e4rendil with its multiple poetic devices. Others have written that it resembles the Celtic Otherworld of T\u00edr na n\u00d3g and that it physically recalls the valley of Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland, where Tolkien went hiking in 1911.\nEtymology.\n\"Rivendell\" is a direct translation or calque into English of the Sindarin Imladris, both meaning \"deep valley\". The name Rivendell is formed by two English elements: \"riven\" (split, cloven) and \"dell\" (valley). Imladris was rendered \"Karningul\" in Westron, the \"Common Tongue\" of Middle-earth represented as English in the text of \"The Lord of the Rings.\" The house of Elrond in Rivendell is also called \"The Last Homely House East of the Sea,\" alluding to the wilderness (Rhovanion) that lies east of the Misty Mountains.\nFiction.\nGeography.\nRivendell lay in eastern Eriador at the edge of a narrow gorge of the river Bruinen (one of the main approaches to Rivendell comes from the nearby Ford of Bruinen), well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the \"Hithaeglir\" or Misty Mountains. Contrary to the map of western Middle-earth published in \"The Lord of the Rings\", the Great East Road did not, in Tolkien's view, lead through Rivendell: Rivendell was maintained as a hidden valley away from the road to the High Pass. Like Hobbiton, it is at about the same latitude as Tolkien's workplace, Oxford.\nHistory.\nRivendell was founded in the Second Age after the dark lord Sauron's destruction of the Elvish land of Eregion. Rivendell remained as the only Elven settlement in eastern Eriador; Gil-galad gave Elrond the Ring Vilya, providing him with the power to protect Rivendell and slow the passage of time in its hidden valley: indeed, Rivendell kept its own calendar. Rivendell survived repeated attacks in the Third Age by the armies of the Witch-king of Angmar. Rivendell held the heirlooms of the Rangers of the North from the lost kingdom of Arnor, including the shards of Elendil's sword Narsil, the Sceptre of Ann\u00faminas, and the Star of Elendil. Elrond fostered the children of the heirs to Arnor's throne, the last being Aragorn. While in Rivendell, Aragorn met and fell in love with Elrond's daughter, Arwen. They were married after he was crowned king of both Gondor and Arnor. Sauron's enemies including Elrond formed the White Council, which met in Rivendell, as when the Council decided to eject the Necromancer from his fortress in Dol Guldur. The protagonists of \"The Hobbit\" take advice from Elrond in Rivendell. The protagonists of \"The Lord of the Rings\" meet in Rivendell, attend the Council of Elrond, and decide on the quest to destroy the One Ring. The hero Aragorn's sword is reforged as And\u00faril by Rivendell's smiths. When the One Ring is destroyed, Elrond's ring loses its power, and he leaves to sail for Valinor.\nAnalysis.\nPhysical origins.\nThe Rivendell valley is based upon the valley of Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland, where Tolkien had gone hiking. Tolkien stated directly that \"From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, the journey ... including the glissade [of Bilbo and the Dwarves] down the slithering stones into the pine woods ... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911\".\nThe medievalist Marjorie Burns writes that Bilbo's approach to Rivendell parallels the early fantasy writer and translator of Norse legend William Morris's approach through the wilds of Iceland to a place he called \"Water-dale\" (\"Vatnsdale\"); both ride across uplands dotted with patches of green, becoming extremely tired; both then cross narrow ravines, and bogs; and both arrive at a hidden valley that offers shelter and comfort. In another place, Morris crosses a \"narrow, bridge-like rock\", just as Bilbo faces a \"narrow bridge of stone without a parapet\" on entering Rivendell.\nA place of sanctuary.\nMatthew T. Dickerson, in the \"J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia\", writes that Rivendell consistently represents a sanctuary, a place that felt like home, throughout the legendarium. \nThe journalist Jane Ciabattari writes that a major reason for the popularity of \"Lord of the Rings\" was the desire for escape among the Vietnam War generation. She compares the military-industrial complex with Mordor, and suggests that they yearned for a place of peace, just as Frodo Baggins felt an \"overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace\u2026 in Rivendell\".\nBurns writes that Rivendell and the other Elvish realm of Lothl\u00f3rien parallel the Celtic Otherworld (in Irish, T\u00edr na n\u00d3g), being hard to find, but if one is admitted and welcomed, one crosses a river, symbolising the spiritual transition from the ordinary realm, and \"the weary adventurer is transported into a haven of Elven hospitality and delight\". There are multiple markers of the transition:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To enter Rivendell is to leave, for a time, the uplands' bleak, mountainous, northerly terrain. First comes the steep descent ...; pines are replaced by beech and oak; the air grows warmer; the first of the elves greet them with laughter and song, and then comes the inevitable water crossing that divides the rest of Middle-earth from the inner core of every Elven realm.\nBurns notes that both \"Riven\" and \"dell\" suggest a low place into which one must descend; and that a descent is characteristic of Celtic tales of entry into the underground realm of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, whose chiefs each rule a burial mound.\nHeroic quest's starting-point.\nThe philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey remarks that Tolkien, a Christian, was extremely careful with dates and timelines, but that hardly any readers notice that the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell on its quest on 25 December, the date of Christmas, and succeeds, destroying the Ring and causing the fall of Sauron, on 25 March, the date in Anglo-Saxon tradition for the Crucifixion.\nThe Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that both Frodo and Aragorn receive their renewed magic swords in Rivendell, marking them out as heroes in the epic tradition of Sigurd and Arthur, at the start of their quest.\nCultural allusions.\nShippey contrasts the versions of the \"Old Walking Song\" sung by Bilbo and Frodo. Bilbo follows the \"Road ... with eager feet\", hoping to reach the peace of Rivendell, to retire and take his ease; whereas Frodo sings \"with weary feet\", hoping somehow to reach Mordor bearing the Ring, and to try to destroy it in the Cracks of Doom: diametrically opposed destinations and errands. He notes that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, and cites Tolkien's statement that the song that the Hobbits hear in Rivendell, \"A Elbereth Gilthoniel\" invoking the semi-divine Varda, was a hymn suggestive of his own devout Catholicism. Shippey writes, too, that Tolkien had Bilbo write and sing the Song of Earendil in Rivendell, making use of multiple poetic devices \u2013 rhyme, internal half-rhyme, alliteration, alliterative assonance, and \"a frequent if irregular variation of syntax\" \u2013 to create a mysterious Elvish effect of \"rich and continuous uncertainty, a pattern forever being glimpsed but never quite grasped.\" Rebecca Ankeny comments that Tolkien uses verse, too, to signal the horror of the Elves when Gandalf speaks the dark lord's rhyme of the Rings aloud, in the Black Speech, threatening the end of Rivendell.\nThe Tolkien scholar Gergely Nagy notes that Tolkien wanted to present the complex set of writings of \"The Silmarillion\" as a seemingly-genuine collection of tales and myths within the frame of his fictional Middle-earth; he modified \"The Lord of the Rings\" to ascribe the documents to Bilbo, supposedly written in the years he spent in Rivendell, and preserved in the fictitious \"Red Book of Westmarch\", its name alluding to the \"Red Book of Hergest\".\nBurns writes that Rivendell, \"the Last Homely House\", offers a welcoming home, repeating the pattern set in both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\" of \"easy-going but tidy bachelor indulgence\" from Bilbo's Bag End hobbit-hole onwards; despite Arwen, there is hardly anything \"of the feminine\". Shippey states that Frodo has \"to be dug out ... of no fewer than five 'Homely Houses'\", of which Rivendell is the last.\nAdaptations.\nIn Peter Jackson's 2001 film \"\", Rivendell was represented by Kaitoke Regional Park, New Zealand, though the waterfalls were added with computer-generated imagery. Brian Rosebury comments that Jackson presents the Elves as sophisticated, where Tolkien made them close to nature. All the same, he writes, the film Rivendell's \"architecture and ornaments are dominated by natural motifs\", suggesting \"integration with nature, but at one remove\", something that works well for the \"Portmeirion-like idyll\" of the portrayed Rivendell. Rosebury describes the design as \"post-Ruskinian\", as in pre-Raphaelite paintings, William Morris's Arts and Crafts designs, and Art Nouveau architectural details. These differ from Tolkien's own illustrations, but in a way, Rosebury suggests, that Tolkien would have liked as it matches his dislike of industrialised manufacture.\nLegacy.\nIn the period of counterculture in the Western world of the 1960s and 1970s, a commune called \"Maos Lyst\" (Mao's Delight) was founded on the island of Zealand, Denmark, in 1968, its inhabitants replacing their surnames with \"Kl\u00f8vedal\", the Danish for Rivendell. Several of them later became well-known cultural personalities in the country. \nThe Rivendell Winery operated from 1987 to 2008 in New York's Hudson River Valley. \nThe Tolkien Ensemble set all the songs in \"The Lord of the Rings\" to music on four CDs between 1997 and 2005, each with \"Rivendell\" in its title. The Swedish classical composer Anna-Lena Laurin has written a work for two guitars entitled \"Rivendell\".\nThe Canadian progressive rock band Rush memorialised the Elvish sanctuary in the song \"Rivendell\" on their 1975 studio album \"Fly by Night\". The song focuses on the tranquillity and seemingly endless time a weary traveller could find there, with lyrics such as \"Elfin songs and endless nights / Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights / Time will never touch you / Here in this enchanted place\".\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

An important part of this method involves computing a combined effect size across all of the studies. As such, this statistical approach involves extracting effect sizes and variance measures from various studies. By combining these effect sizes the statistical power is improved and can resolve uncertainties or discrepancies found in individual studies. Meta-analyses are integral in supporting research grant proposals, shaping treatment guidelines, and influencing health policies. They are also pivotal in summarizing existing research to guide future studies, thereby cementing their role as a fundamental methodology in metascience. Meta-analyses are often, but not always, important components of a systematic review.\nHistory.\nThe term \"meta-analysis\" was coined in 1976 by the statistician Gene Glass, who stated \"Meta-analysis refers to the analysis of analyses\". Glass's work aimed at describing aggregated measures of relationships and effects. While Glass is credited with authoring the first modern meta-analysis, a paper published in 1904 by the statistician Karl Pearson in the \"British Medical Journal\" collated data from several studies of typhoid inoculation and is seen as the first time a meta-analytic approach was used to aggregate the outcomes of multiple clinical studies. Numerous other examples of early meta-analyses can be found including occupational aptitude testing, and agriculture.\nThe first model meta-analysis was published in 1978 on the effectiveness of psychotherapy outcomes by Mary Lee Smith and Gene Glass. After publication of their article there was pushback on the usefulness and validity of meta-analysis as a tool for evidence synthesis. The first example of this was by Hans Eysenck who in a 1978 article in response to the work done by Mary Lee Smith and Gene Glass called meta-analysis an \"exercise in mega-silliness\". Later Eysenck would refer to meta-analysis as \"statistical alchemy\". Despite these criticisms the use of meta-analysis has only grown since its modern introduction. By 1991 there were 334 published meta-analyses; this number grew to 9,135 by 2014.\nThe field of meta-analysis expanded greatly since the 1970s and touches multiple disciplines including psychology, medicine, and ecology. Further the more recent creation of evidence synthesis communities has increased the cross pollination of ideas, methods, and the creation of software tools across disciplines.\nLiterature search.\nOne of the most important steps of a meta-analysis is data collection. For an efficient database search, appropriate keywords and search limits need to be identified. The use of Boolean operators and search limits can assist the literature search. A number of databases are available (e.g., PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo), however, it is up to the researcher to choose the most appropriate sources for their research area. Indeed, many scientists use duplicate search terms within two or more databases to cover multiple sources. The reference lists of eligible studies can also be searched for eligible studies (i.e., snowballing). The initial search may return a large volume of studies. Quite often, the abstract or the title of the manuscript reveals that the study is not eligible for inclusion, based on the pre-specified criteria. These studies can be discarded. However, if it appears that the study may be eligible (or even if there is some doubt) the full paper can be retained for closer inspection. The references lists of eligible articles can also be searched for any relevant articles. These search results need to be detailed in a PRIMSA flow diagram which details the flow of information through all stages of the review. Thus, it is important to note how many studies were returned after using the specified search terms and how many of these studies were discarded, and for what reason. The search terms and strategy should be specific enough for a reader to reproduce the search. The date range of studies, along with the date (or date period) the search was conducted should also be provided.\nA data collection form provides a standardized means of collecting data from eligible studies. For a meta-analysis of correlational data, effect size information is usually collected as Pearson's \"r\" statistic. Partial correlations are often reported in research, however, these may inflate relationships in comparison to zero-order correlations. Moreover, the partialed out variables will likely vary from study-to-study. As a consequence, many meta-analyses exclude partial correlations from their analysis. As a final resort, plot digitizers can be used to scrape data points from scatterplots (if available) for the calculation of Pearson's \"r\". Data reporting important study characteristics that may moderate effects, such as the mean age of participants, should also be collected. A measure of study quality can also be included in these forms to assess the quality of evidence from each study. There are more than 80 tools available to assess the quality and risk of bias in observational studies reflecting the diversity of research approaches between fields. These tools usually include an assessment of how dependent variables were measured, appropriate selection of participants, and appropriate control for confounding factors. Other quality measures that may be more relevant for correlational studies include sample size, psychometric properties, and reporting of methods.\nA final consideration is whether to include studies from the gray literature, which is defined as research that has not been formally published. This type of literature includes conference abstracts, dissertations, and pre-prints. While the inclusion of gray literature reduces the risk of publication bias, the methodological quality of the work is often (but not always) lower than formally published work. Reports from conference proceedings, which are the most common source of gray literature, are poorly reported and data in the subsequent publication is often inconsistent, with differences observed in almost 20% of published studies.\nMethods and assumptions.\nApproaches.\nIn general, two types of evidence can be distinguished when performing a meta-analysis: individual participant data (IPD), and aggregate data (AD). The aggregate data can be direct or indirect.\nAD is more commonly available (e.g. from the literature) and typically represents summary estimates such as odds ratios or relative risks. This can be directly synthesized across conceptually similar studies using several approaches. On the other hand, indirect aggregate data measures the effect of two treatments that were each compared against a similar control group in a meta-analysis. For example, if treatment A and treatment B were directly compared vs placebo in separate meta-analyses, we can use these two pooled results to get an estimate of the effects of A vs B in an indirect comparison as effect A vs Placebo minus effect B vs Placebo.\nIPD evidence represents raw data as collected by the study centers. This distinction has raised the need for different meta-analytic methods when evidence synthesis is desired, and has led to the development of one-stage and two-stage methods. In one-stage methods the IPD from all studies are modeled simultaneously whilst accounting for the clustering of participants within studies. Two-stage methods first compute summary statistics for AD from each study and then calculate overall statistics as a weighted average of the study statistics. By reducing IPD to AD, two-stage methods can also be applied when IPD is available; this makes them an appealing choice when performing a meta-analysis. Although it is conventionally believed that one-stage and two-stage methods yield similar results, recent studies have shown that they may occasionally lead to different conclusions.\nStatistical models for aggregate data.\nFixed effect model.\nThe fixed effect model provides a weighted average of a series of study estimates. The inverse of the estimates' variance is commonly used as study weight, so that larger studies tend to contribute more than smaller studies to the weighted average. Consequently, when studies within a meta-analysis are dominated by a very large study, the findings from smaller studies are practically ignored. Most importantly, the fixed effects model assumes that all included studies investigate the same population, use the same variable and outcome definitions, etc. This assumption is typically unrealistic as research is often prone to several sources of heterogeneity.\nIf we start with a collection of independent effect size estimates, each estimate a corresponding effect size formula_1 we can assume that formula_2 where formula_3 denotes the observed effect in the formula_4-th study, formula_5 the corresponding (unknown) true effect, formula_6 is the sampling error, and formula_7. Therefore, the formula_3's are assumed to be unbiased and normally distributed estimates of their corresponding true effects. The sampling variances (i.e., formula_9 values) are assumed to be known.\nRandom effects model.\nMost meta-analyses are based on sets of studies that are not exactly identical in their methods and/or the characteristics of the included samples. Differences in the methods and sample characteristics may introduce variability (\"heterogeneity\") among the true effects. One way to model the heterogeneity is to treat it as purely random. The weight that is applied in this process of weighted averaging with a random effects meta-analysis is achieved in two steps:\nThis means that the greater this variability in effect sizes (otherwise known as heterogeneity), the greater the un-weighting and this can reach a point when the random effects meta-analysis result becomes simply the un-weighted average effect size across the studies. At the other extreme, when all effect sizes are similar (or variability does not exceed sampling error), no REVC is applied and the random effects meta-analysis defaults to simply a fixed effect meta-analysis (only inverse variance weighting).\nThe extent of this reversal is solely dependent on two factors:\nSince neither of these factors automatically indicates a faulty larger study or more reliable smaller studies, the re-distribution of weights under this model will not bear a relationship to what these studies actually might offer. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that redistribution of weights is simply in one direction from larger to smaller studies as heterogeneity increases until eventually all studies have equal weight and no more redistribution is possible.\nAnother issue with the random effects model is that the most commonly used confidence intervals generally do not retain their coverage probability above the specified nominal level and thus substantially underestimate the statistical error and are potentially\noverconfident in their conclusions. Several fixes have been suggested but the debate continues on. A further concern is that the average treatment effect can sometimes be even less conservative compared to the fixed effect model and therefore misleading in practice. One interpretational fix that has been suggested is to create a prediction interval around the random effects estimate to portray the range of possible effects in practice. However, an assumption behind the calculation of such a prediction interval is that trials are considered more or less homogeneous entities and that included patient populations and comparator treatments should be considered exchangeable and this is usually unattainable in practice.\nThere are many methods used to estimate between studies variance with restricted maximum likelihood estimator being the least prone to bias and one of the most commonly used. Several advanced iterative techniques for computing the between studies variance exist including both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood methods and random effects models using these methods can be run with multiple software platforms including Excel, Stata, SPSS, and R.\nMost meta-analyses include between 2 and 4 studies and such a sample is more often than not inadequate to accurately estimate heterogeneity. Thus it appears that in small meta-analyses, an incorrect zero between study variance estimate is obtained, leading to a false homogeneity assumption. Overall, it appears that heterogeneity is being consistently underestimated in meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses in which high heterogeneity levels are assumed could be informative. These random effects models and software packages mentioned above relate to study-aggregate meta-analyses and researchers wishing to conduct individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses need to consider mixed-effects modelling approaches./\nQuality effects model.\nDoi and Thalib originally introduced the quality effects model. They introduced a new approach to adjustment for inter-study variability by incorporating the contribution of variance due to a relevant component (quality) in addition to the contribution of variance due to random error that is used in any fixed effects meta-analysis model to generate weights for each study. The strength of the quality effects meta-analysis is that it allows available methodological evidence to be used over subjective random effects, and thereby helps to close the damaging gap which has opened up between methodology and statistics in clinical research. To do this a synthetic bias variance is computed based on quality information to adjust inverse variance weights and the quality adjusted weight of the \"i\"th study is introduced. These adjusted weights are then used in meta-analysis. In other words, if study \"i\" is of good quality and other studies are of poor quality, a proportion of their quality adjusted weights is mathematically redistributed to study \"i\" giving it more weight towards the overall effect size. As studies become increasingly similar in terms of quality, re-distribution becomes progressively less and ceases when all studies are of equal quality (in the case of equal quality, the quality effects model defaults to the IVhet model \u2013 see previous section). A recent evaluation of the quality effects model (with some updates) demonstrates that despite the subjectivity of quality assessment, the performance (MSE and true variance under simulation) is superior to that achievable with the random effects model. This model thus replaces the untenable interpretations that abound in the literature and a software is available to explore this method further.\nNetwork meta-analysis methods.\nIndirect comparison meta-analysis methods (also called network meta-analyses, in particular when multiple treatments are assessed simultaneously) generally use two main methodologies. First, is the Bucher methodwhich is a single or repeated comparison of a closed loop of three-treatments such that one of them is common to the two studies and forms the node where the loop begins and ends. Therefore, multiple two-by-two comparisons (3-treatment loops) are needed to compare multiple treatments. This methodology requires that trials with more than two arms have two arms only selected as independent pair-wise comparisons are required. The alternative methodology uses complex statistical modelling to include the multiple arm trials and comparisons simultaneously between all competing treatments. These have been executed using Bayesian methods, mixed linear models and meta-regression approaches.\nBayesian framework.\nSpecifying a Bayesian network meta-analysis model involves writing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model for general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software such as WinBUGS. In addition, prior distributions have to be specified for a number of the parameters, and the data have to be supplied in a specific format. Together, the DAG, priors, and data form a Bayesian hierarchical model. To complicate matters further, because of the nature of MCMC estimation, overdispersed starting values have to be chosen for a number of independent chains so that convergence can be assessed. Recently, multiple R software packages were developed to simplify the model fitting (e.g., \"metaBMA\" and \"RoBMA\") and even implemented in statistical software with graphical user interface (GUI): JASP. Although the complexity of the Bayesian approach limits usage of this methodology, recent tutorial papers are trying to increase accessibility of the methods. Methodology for automation of this method has been suggested but requires that arm-level outcome data are available, and this is usually unavailable. Great claims are sometimes made for the inherent ability of the Bayesian framework to handle network meta-analysis and its greater flexibility. However, this choice of implementation of framework for inference, Bayesian or frequentist, may be less important than other choices regarding the modeling of effects (see discussion on models above).\nFrequentist multivariate framework.\nOn the other hand, the frequentist multivariate methods involve approximations and assumptions that are not stated explicitly or verified when the methods are applied (see discussion on meta-analysis models above). For example, the mvmeta package for Stata enables network meta-analysis in a frequentist framework. However, if there is no common comparator in the network, then this has to be handled by augmenting the dataset with fictional arms with high variance, which is not very objective and requires a decision as to what constitutes a sufficiently high variance. The other issue is use of the random effects model in both this frequentist framework and the Bayesian framework. Senn advises analysts to be cautious about interpreting the 'random effects' analysis since only one random effect is allowed for but one could envisage many. Senn goes on to say that it is rather na\u0131ve, even in the case where only two treatments are being compared to assume that random-effects analysis accounts for all uncertainty about the way effects can vary from trial to trial. Newer models of meta-analysis such as those discussed above would certainly help alleviate this situation and have been implemented in the next framework.\nGeneralized pairwise modelling framework.\nAn approach that has been tried since the late 1990s is the implementation of the multiple three-treatment closed-loop analysis. This has not been popular because the process rapidly becomes overwhelming as network complexity increases. Development in this area was then abandoned in favor of the Bayesian and multivariate frequentist methods which emerged as alternatives. Very recently, automation of the three-treatment closed loop method has been developed for complex networks by some researchers as a way to make this methodology available to the mainstream research community. This proposal does restrict each trial to two interventions, but also introduces a workaround for multiple arm trials: a different fixed control node can be selected in different runs. It also utilizes robust meta-analysis methods so that many of the problems highlighted above are avoided. Further research around this framework is required to determine if this is indeed superior to the Bayesian or multivariate frequentist frameworks. Researchers willing to try this out have access to this framework through a free software.\nDiagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis.\nDiagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analyses differ methodologically from those assessing intervention effects, as they aim to jointly synthesize pairs of sensitivity and specificity values. These parameters are typically analyzed using hierarchical models that account for the correlation between them and between-study heterogeneity. Two commonly used models are the bivariate random-effects model and the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model. These approaches are recommended by the \"Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Diagnostic Test Accuracy\" and are widely used in reviews of screening tests, imaging tools, and laboratory diagnostics.\nBeyond the standard hierarchical models, other approaches have been developed to address various complexities in diagnostic accuracy synthesis. These include methods that incorporate differences in threshold effects, account for covariates through meta-regression, or improve applicability by considering test setting and clinical variation. Some frameworks aim to adapt the synthesis to reflect intended use conditions more directly. These extensions are part of an evolving body of methodology that reflects growing experience in the field and increasing demands from clinical and policy decision-makers.\nAggregating IPD and AD.\nMeta-analysis can also be applied to combine IPD and AD. This is convenient when the researchers who conduct the analysis have their own raw data while collecting aggregate or summary data from the literature. The generalized integration model (GIM) is a generalization of the meta-analysis. It allows that the model fitted on the individual participant data (IPD) is different from the ones used to compute the aggregate data (AD). GIM can be viewed as a model calibration method for integrating information with more flexibility.\nValidation of meta-analysis results.\nThe meta-analysis estimate represents a weighted average across studies and when there is heterogeneity this may result in the summary estimate not being representative of individual studies. Qualitative appraisal of the primary studies using established tools can uncover potential biases, but does not quantify the aggregate effect of these biases on the summary estimate. Although the meta-analysis result could be compared with an independent prospective primary study, such external validation is often impractical. This has led to the development of methods that exploit a form of leave-one-out cross validation, sometimes referred to as internal-external cross validation (IOCV). Here each of the k included studies in turn is omitted and compared with the summary estimate derived from aggregating the remaining k- 1 studies. A general validation statistic, Vn based on IOCV has been developed to measure the statistical validity of meta-analysis results. For test accuracy and prediction, particularly when there are multivariate effects, other approaches which seek to estimate the prediction error have also been proposed.\nChallenges.\nA meta-analysis of several small studies does not always predict the results of a single large study. Some have argued that a weakness of the method is that sources of bias are not controlled by the method: a good meta-analysis cannot correct for poor design or bias in the original studies. This would mean that only methodologically sound studies should be included in a meta-analysis, a practice called 'best evidence synthesis'. Other meta-analysts would include weaker studies, and add a study-level predictor variable that reflects the methodological quality of the studies to examine the effect of study quality on the effect size. However, others have argued that a better approach is to preserve information about the variance in the study sample, casting as wide a net as possible, and that methodological selection criteria introduce unwanted subjectivity, defeating the purpose of the approach. More recently, and under the influence of a push for open practices in science, tools to develop \"crowd-sourced\" living meta-analyses that are updated by communities of scientists in hopes of making all the subjective choices more explicit.\nPublication bias: the file drawer problem.\nAnother potential pitfall is the reliance on the available body of published studies, which may create exaggerated outcomes due to publication bias, as studies which show negative results or insignificant results are less likely to be published. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been known to hide negative studies and researchers may have overlooked unpublished studies such as dissertation studies or conference abstracts that did not reach publication. This is not easily solved, as one cannot know how many studies have gone unreported.\nThis file drawer problem characterized by negative or non-significant results being tucked away in a cabinet, can result in a biased distribution of effect sizes thus creating a serious base rate fallacy, in which the significance of the published studies is overestimated, as other studies were either not submitted for publication or were rejected. This should be seriously considered when interpreting the outcomes of a meta-analysis.\nThe distribution of effect sizes can be visualized with a funnel plot which (in its most common version) is a scatter plot of standard error versus the effect size. It makes use of the fact that the smaller studies (thus larger standard errors) have more scatter of the magnitude of effect (being less precise) while the larger studies have less scatter and form the tip of the funnel. If many negative studies were not published, the remaining positive studies give rise to a funnel plot in which the base is skewed to one side (asymmetry of the funnel plot). In contrast, when there is no publication bias, the effect of the smaller studies has no reason to be skewed to one side and so a symmetric funnel plot results. This also means that if no publication bias is present, there would be no relationship between standard error and effect size. A negative or positive relation between standard error and effect size would imply that smaller studies that found effects in one direction only were more likely to be published and/or to be submitted for publication.\nApart from the visual funnel plot, statistical methods for detecting publication bias have also been proposed. These are controversial because they typically have low power for detection of bias, but also may make false positives under some circumstances. For instance small study effects (biased smaller studies), wherein methodological differences between smaller and larger studies exist, may cause asymmetry in effect sizes that resembles publication bias. However, small study effects may be just as problematic for the interpretation of meta-analyses, and the imperative is on meta-analytic authors to investigate potential sources of bias.\nThe problem of publication bias is not trivial as it is suggested that 25% of meta-analyses in the psychological sciences may have suffered from publication bias. However, low power of existing tests and problems with the visual appearance of the funnel plot remain an issue, and estimates of publication bias may remain lower than what truly exists.\nMost discussions of publication bias focus on journal practices favoring publication of statistically significant findings. However, questionable research practices, such as reworking statistical models until significance is achieved, may also favor statistically significant findings in support of researchers' hypotheses.\nProblems related to studies not reporting non-statistically significant effects.\nStudies often do not report the effects when they do not reach statistical significance. For example, they may simply say that the groups did not show statistically significant differences, without reporting any other information (e.g. a statistic or p-value). Exclusion of these studies would lead to a situation similar to publication bias, but their inclusion (assuming null effects) would also bias the meta-analysis.\nProblems related to the statistical approach.\nOther weaknesses are that it has not been determined if the statistically most accurate method for combining results is the fixed, IVhet, random or quality effect models, though the criticism against the random effects model is mounting because of the perception that the new random effects (used in meta-analysis) are essentially formal devices to facilitate smoothing or shrinkage and prediction may be impossible or ill-advised. The main problem with the random effects approach is that it uses the classic statistical thought of generating a \"compromise estimator\" that makes the weights close to the naturally weighted estimator if heterogeneity across studies is large but close to the inverse variance weighted estimator if the between study heterogeneity is small. However, what has been ignored is the distinction between the model \"we choose\" to analyze a given dataset, and the \"mechanism by which the data came into being\". A random effect can be present in either of these roles, but the two roles are quite distinct. There's no reason to think the analysis model and data-generation mechanism (model) are similar in form, but many sub-fields of statistics have developed the habit of assuming, for theory and simulations, that the data-generation mechanism (model) is identical to the analysis model we choose (or would like others to choose). As a hypothesized mechanisms for producing the data, the random effect model for meta-analysis is silly and it is more appropriate to think of this model as a superficial description and something we choose as an analytical tool \u2013 but this choice for meta-analysis may not work because the study effects are a fixed feature of the respective meta-analysis and the probability distribution is only a descriptive tool.\nProblems arising from agenda-driven bias.\nThe most severe fault in meta-analysis often occurs when the person or persons doing the meta-analysis have an economic, social, or political agenda such as the passage or defeat of legislation. People with these types of agendas may be more likely to abuse meta-analysis due to personal bias. For example, researchers favorable to the author's agenda are likely to have their studies cherry-picked while those not favorable will be ignored or labeled as \"not credible\". In addition, the favored authors may themselves be biased or paid to produce results that support their overall political, social, or economic goals in ways such as selecting small favorable data sets and not incorporating larger unfavorable data sets. The influence of such biases on the results of a meta-analysis is possible because the methodology of meta-analysis is highly malleable.\nA 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed. The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals, 15 from specialty medicine journals, and three from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed a total of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources, with 219 (69%) receiving funding from industry (i.e. one or more authors\nhaving financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry). Of the 509 RCTs, 132 reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing one or more authors having financial ties to industry. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded \"without acknowledgment of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers' understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.\"\nFor example, in 1998, a US federal judge found that the United States Environmental Protection Agency had abused the meta-analysis process to produce a study claiming cancer risks to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with the intent to influence policy makers to pass smoke-free\u2013workplace laws.\nComparability and validity of included studies.\nMeta-analysis may often not be a substitute for an adequately powered primary study, particularly in the biological sciences.\nHeterogeneity of methods used may lead to faulty conclusions. For instance, differences in the forms of an intervention or the cohorts that are thought to be minor or are unknown to the scientists could lead to substantially different results, including results that distort the meta-analysis' results or are not adequately considered in its data. Vice versa, results from meta-analyses may also make certain hypothesis or interventions seem nonviable and preempt further research or approvals, despite certain modifications \u2013 such as intermittent administration, personalized criteria and combination measures \u2013 leading to substantially different results, including in cases where such have been successfully identified and applied in small-scale studies that were considered in the meta-analysis. Standardization, reproduction of experiments, open data and open protocols may often not mitigate such problems, for instance as relevant factors and criteria could be unknown or not be recorded.\nThere is a debate about the appropriate balance between testing with as few animals or humans as possible and the need to obtain robust, reliable findings. It has been argued that unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful and that studies are not just wasteful when they stop too late but also when they stop too early. In large clinical trials, planned, sequential analyses are sometimes used if there is considerable expense or potential harm associated with testing participants. In applied behavioural science, \"megastudies\" have been proposed to investigate the efficacy of many different interventions designed in an interdisciplinary manner by separate teams.&lt;ref name=\"10.1038/s41586-021-04128-4\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One such study used a fitness chain to recruit a large number participants. It has been suggested that behavioural interventions are often hard to compare [in meta-analyses and reviews], as \"different scientists test different intervention ideas in different samples using different outcomes over different time intervals\", causing a lack of comparability of such individual investigations which limits \"their potential to inform policy\".\nWeak inclusion standards lead to misleading conclusions.\nMeta-analyses in education are often not restrictive enough in regards to the methodological quality of the studies they include. For example, studies that include small samples or researcher-made measures lead to inflated effect size estimates. However, this problem also troubles meta-analysis of clinical trials. The use of different quality assessment tools (QATs) lead to including different studies and obtaining conflicting estimates of average treatment effects.\nApplications in modern science.\nModern statistical meta-analysis does more than just combine the effect sizes of a set of studies using a weighted average. It can test if the outcomes of studies show more variation than the variation that is expected because of the sampling of different numbers of research participants. Additionally, study characteristics such as measurement instrument used, population sampled, or aspects of the studies' design can be coded and used to reduce variance of the estimator (see statistical models above). Thus some methodological weaknesses in studies can be corrected statistically. Other uses of meta-analytic methods include the development and validation of clinical prediction models, where meta-analysis may be used to combine individual participant data from different research centers and to assess the model's generalisability, or even to aggregate existing prediction models.\nMeta-analysis can be done with single-subject design as well as group research designs. This is important because much research has been done with single-subject research designs. Considerable dispute exists for the most appropriate meta-analytic technique for single subject research.\nMeta-analysis leads to a shift of emphasis from single studies to multiple studies. It emphasizes the practical importance of the effect size instead of the statistical significance of individual studies. This shift in thinking has been termed \"meta-analytic thinking\". The results of a meta-analysis are often shown in a forest plot.\nResults from studies are combined using different approaches. One approach frequently used in meta-analysis in health care research is termed 'inverse variance method'. The average effect size across all studies is computed as a \"weighted mean\", whereby the weights are equal to the inverse variance of each study's effect estimator. Larger studies and studies with less random variation are given greater weight than smaller studies. Other common approaches include the Mantel\u2013Haenszel method and the Peto method.\nSeed-based d mapping (formerly signed differential mapping, SDM) is a statistical technique for meta-analyzing studies on differences in brain activity or structure which used neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, VBM or PET.\nDifferent high throughput techniques such as microarrays have been used to understand Gene expression. MicroRNA expression profiles have been used to identify differentially expressed microRNAs in particular cell or tissue type or disease conditions or to check the effect of a treatment. A meta-analysis of such expression profiles was performed to derive novel conclusions and to validate the known findings.\nMeta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes. Some methods have been developed to enable functionally informed rare variant association meta-analysis in biobank-scale cohorts using efficient approaches for summary statistic storage.\nSweeping meta-analyses can also be used to estimate a network of effects. This allows researchers to examine patterns in the fuller panorama of more accurately estimated results and draw conclusions that consider the broader context (e.g., how personality-intelligence relations vary by trait family).\nSoftware.\nR Package: metafor &amp; meta, RevMan, JASP, Jamovi, \nStatsDirect,\nMetaEssential, \nComprehensive meta-analysis\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSources.\n\"\u00a0This article incorporates https:// by Daniel S.

The series was created and produced by several alumni from \"Doctor Who\". The titular character was an adventurer born in 1867, who had been revived from hibernation in 1966, thus offering a satirical look at life in the 1960s through the eyes of a Victorian. In 2020, Big Finish Productions reimagined the series as a Radio drama.\nPremise.\nThe main character originally went through a number of possible names: \"Cornelius Chance\", \"Rupert De'Ath\", \"Dick Daring\", \"Dexter Noble\", \"Aurelian Winton\", \"Magnus Hawke\" and even \"Darius Crud\" before Sydney Newman settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term adamantine which, since the Middle Ages, has commonly referred to diamond. In the opening episode, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", Adam Llewellyn De Vere Adamant is a swashbuckling Edwardian gentleman adventurer who, in 1902 (when Edward VII had been on the throne just one year), goes to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Louise. In fact, he is lured into a trap, whereupon he is captured and condemned to be frozen forever in a block of ice by his nemesis, the Face, whose identity is concealed behind a leather mask and who speaks in a sinister whispering voice. The Face grants him one last request, and Adamant asks to see Louise; in his last moments of life before being frozen, he learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.\nAdamant is found in 1966, when a building is being knocked down, and he is revived. On emerging from a hospital and collapsing on the London streets, he is rescued by Georgina Jones and taken to her flat. Adamant immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina is threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though in many ways a typical swinging sixties woman, Georgina had grown up idolising Adamant through tales of his turn-of-the-century exploits. She tries to get involved with all his cases, despite his efforts to stop her, and often manages to get a job at the scene in question at a moment's notice. The part was played by Ann Holloway in the untransmitted pilot episode, but was recast with Juliet Harmer as it was felt that Holloway's performance did not fit the series. During the second episode, \"Death Has a Thousand Faces\", the events of which are set in Blackpool, he acquires a manservant in the form of former music hall artiste and Punch and Judy man William E. Simms. The character was originally to have been played by John Dawson, who hurt his back lifting an actress during rehearsals for \"The Sweet Smell of Disaster\" and was unable to continue. The part was recast, going instead to Jack May.\nAdamant is an expert swordsman, carrying a swordstick with which he cold-bloodedly kills any enemy who deserves it. John Steed of \"The Avengers\" and Lord Peter Wimsey used similar weapons. Adamant was a colonel, and a member of the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895, though he is listed on their official records as being \"missing, presumed killed\" since 1902. He is also a good boxer, and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen.\nThough there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adamant rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, on the top of a multi-storey car park which he had bought at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a hidden call button. He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised number plate \"AA 1000\". The car was a special conversion: a \"Mini de Ville\" by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does jobs for the British Government, as in \"More Deadly Than the Sword\". When he is knocked unconscious, Adamant often dreams of how he was caught by the Face and Louise. He continues to be taken advantage of by women in the 1960s, owing to his out-of-time na\u00efvet\u00e9.\nThe Face returned to the show in the second series, beginning with the episode \"A Slight Case of Reincarnation\". He joins Adamant in the present day, having also been frozen in 1902. His accomplice Louise aged naturally, watching over him during the intervening years, before reviving him. Throughout the second series The Face would assist Adamant's antagonists, but routinely escaped before facing defeat himself. In the final episode, Adamant celebrates his 100th birthday in the final episode, \"A Sinister Sort of Service\", receiving a telegram from the Queen.\nProduction.\nSeries development.\n\"Adam Adamant Lives!\" has been called by modern observers \"what \"Doctor Who\" did next\", because at least three \"Doctor Who\" alumni had key positions on the pilot. It reunited producer Verity Lambert with Head of Television Drama Sydney Newman. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched \"Doctor Who\". The series also brought Donald Cotton, who had the same year written two serials for \"Doctor Who\", back into Newman's orbit. Cotton and partner Richard Harris would write the first script, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\", and would therefore come to be credited as co-creators. However, over the years, Newman has been cited as creator of the show. Even the BBC has at times propagated this idea, calling him the creator on some of their own pages devoted to the programme, but not on others.\n\"Adam Adamant Lives!\" was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective Sexton Blake. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Cotton and Harris, along with script editor Tony Williamson, to come up with an alternative idea. Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic Mary Whitehouse had been partial inspiration for the character. Many of the indoor scenes were filmed at Studios 3 and 5 at the BBC Television Centre in London.\nFilming.\nGerald Harper chose to wear false eyebrows when playing the title role, based on those of his make-up artist. He also wore a wig. Harper was shortsighted and wore glasses, which he removed as soon as filming was ready to start. When the series ended, the make-up woman sewed his fake eyebrows onto a sampler, with \"Here lie the Eyebrows of Adam Adamant, 1966\u20131967\" underneath, which was framed and given to Harper as a memento. He also kept his chararcter's swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.\nCancellation.\nTelevision critic Paul Stump opines in the BBC Four documentary \"The Cult of Adam Adamant!\" that the programme ended because the contemporaneously airing \"The Avengers\" was a \"sexier, slicker, better-funded\" version of the same concept.\nGerald Harper went on to appear in Yorkshire Television's \"Gazette\" and its sequel \"Hadleigh\".\nEpisodes.\nThe untransmitted pilot episode, \"Adam Adamant Lives\", no longer exists in the BBC Archives. All of series one, with the exception of \"Ticket to Terror\", is held by the BBC. Series two has not fared so well, with only \"Black Echo\" and \"A Sinister Sort of Service\" remaining in existence.\nLost episodes.\nThere were originally 29 black-and-white episodes composing two series, plus one unbroadcast pilot titled \"Adam Adamant Lives\" (without exclamation mark, as here). The 1902 sequence is now all that is known to survive of this unseen debut episode of the series, and only exists because it was later reused in \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\". No script of \"Adam Adamant Lives\" is known to exist, and the only documentation that remains is the description given in the Drama Early Warning Synopsis issued on Thursday 10 March 1966; this is included in the booklet \"Adam Adamant Lives!: Viewing Notes\" accompanying the DVD boxed set \"Adam Adamant Lives!: The Complete Collection\" released by 2entertain Ltd in July 2006.\nThe first series, with the exception of \"Ticket to Terror\", was made as a mixture of single camera 16 mm film for the location sequences, and multi-camera studio recording using 625-line electronic cameras. However, instead of being edited on video tape, as was the usual BBC procedure, the series was edited entirely on film, with the output of the studio cameras being telerecorded, for ease of editing. (At that time, videotape editing was difficult.)\n\"Ticket to Terror\" from the first series, and all of the second series, were made with the usual BBC mix of tape and film, but were edited on tape. Wiping by the BBC in the 1970s has resulted in no master videotapes having survived. Film recordings haven't all survived either as, in one case, one episode on 35 mm film is known to have been destroyed.\nThe result of all this is that only 16 episodes remained in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including the first and last episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35 mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35 mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, \"D For Destruction\", thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, from a mislabelled film can in the BBC Archives. It has been shown in public at the Missing Believed Wiped event, and is included in the \"Complete Collection\" DVD set.\nAnother lost episode, \"The Basardi Affair\", was recovered as a complete off-air audio recording in 2017, and remains to date the only missing \"Adam Adamant Lives!\" episode known to exist in this format.\nA public appeal campaign, the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, continues to search for missing episodes.\nHome media.\nVHS.\n\"Adam Adamant Lives!\"\nContains the first two episodes of Series One, \"A Vintage Year for Scoundrels\" and \"Death Has a Thousand Faces\", the latter replacing the previously considered \"The Village of Evil\".

There was also a similarity with Granada's \"Mr. Rose\" (1967) in which William Mervyn as a retired police inspector was assisted by a youngish confidential secretary (Gillian Lewis) and a manservant (Donald Webster). However, because \"Adam Adamant\" was a last-minute replacement for another concept, the degree to which the BBC intended such similarities with \"The Avengers\" is unclear. Lambert directly addressed the issue: \"In \"Adam Adamant Lives\", we were trying to create something original. Even though it may have been aimed at a similar audience to \"The Avengers\" \u2013 any production decisions we made were not influenced by trying to imitate\".\nHowever, a reviewer of the 2006 BBC Four retrospective \"The Cult of ... Adam Adamant Lives!\" detected something more to the issue when Lambert and other principals were interviewed on camera: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The genial and personable Harmer, Clemens, Harper and producer Verity Lambert all owned up to the clunking obviousness of the series' hamfisted and, in retrospect, laughable attempt to trump ABC's masterpiece. Even an otherwise impartial and unironic script compared the two shows thus: \"Edwardian gent teamed with beautiful girl ... and Edwardian gent teamed with beautiful girl\". The unspoken tag, of course, was that \"The Avengers\" had queered this pitch three years previously.\u2014\u200a\nAnthony Clark at the British Film Institute|(BFI) noted that while the show \"owes a stylistic debt to \"The Avengers\"\", it was \"the BBC's reply to the success of ITV's spy and action series like \"The Saint\" (1962\u201369) and \"Danger Man\" (1960\u201369)\". He goes on to call the character of Adamant \"more age-of-empire adventurer than spoof spy\". A Television Heaven review said that while the programme has been \"long cited as the BBC's answer to \"The Avengers\"\", it in fact \"owes more to the slick style, tone and format of Lew Grade's phenomenally successful ITC stable of action series rather than the sleek and sophisticated antics of Steed and Mrs Peel\".\n\"Doctor Who\".\nHarper's portrayal of Adamant has been cited as formative to Jon Pertwee's interpretation of the Doctor.

In particular, allusions are seen between the way in which Austin Powers, like Adamant, is revived from cryogenic sleep and befriended by an attractive woman who had known of his exploits before being frozen. The formula is exactly reversed in \"Powers\", however, in that his partner, Vanessa Kensington, is not impressed with his previous record of service, whereas Georgina Jones is a positive fan of Adamant.\nBig Finish audio series.\nAudio drama production company Big Finish Productions announced that they would be producing a new series of audio plays, written by and co-starring actor-novelist Guy Adams as Simms.

{"id": "62332", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62332", "title": "Deep-sea fish", "text": "Fauna found in deep-sea areas\nDeep-sea fish are fish that live in the darkness below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the epipelagic or photic zone of the sea. The lanternfish is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish. Other deep-sea fishes include the flashlight fish, cookiecutter shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and some species of eelpout.\nOnly about 2% of known marine species inhabit the pelagic environment. This means that they live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea floor. Deep-sea organisms generally inhabit bathypelagic ( deep) and abyssopelagic ( deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as bioluminescence can be seen in the mesopelagic ( deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones are aphotic, meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable ocean space.\nThe epipelagic zone (0\u2013200\u00a0metres or 0\u2013650\u00a0ft deep) is the area where light penetrates the water and photosynthesis occurs. This is also known as the photic zone. Because this typically extends only a few hundred meters below the water, the deep sea, about 90% of the ocean volume, is in darkness. The deep sea is also an extremely hostile environment, with temperatures that rarely exceed and fall as low as (with the exception of hydrothermal vent ecosystems that can exceed 350\u00a0\u00b0C, or 662\u00a0\u00b0F), low oxygen levels, and pressures between 20 and 1000\u00a0atm (2-100\u00a0MPa, 300\u201314,500\u00a0psi).\nEvolution.\nIt has been speculated that deep-sea ecosystems may have been inhospitable to vertebrate life prior to an increased influx of nutrients into the ocean during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous following the rise of angiosperms on land, which led to an increase in abyssal invertebrate life, allowing fish to in turn colonize these ecosystems. However, some modern deep-sea fish, such as holocephalians, are descendants of much older lineages, indicating that much earlier colonizations of the deep-sea by vertebrates may have occurred, although no fossil evidence of this is known.\nThe earliest known records of deep-sea fish are trace fossils of feeding and swimming behavior attributed to unidentified neoteleosts (referable to the ichnogenera \"Piscichnus\" and \"Undichna\"), from the Early Cretaceous (130 million-year-old) Palombini Shale of Italy, which is thought to have been deposited in the abyssal plain of the former Piemont-Liguria Ocean. Prior to the discovery of these fossils, there was no evidence for deep-sea bony fish older than 50 million years in the Paleogene. The Cretaceous origin for most modern deep-sea fish has been further affirmed with phylogenetic studies such as those of aulopiform fish, which indicate that many deep-sea lineages of these groups originated around this time.\nAlthough the records from the Palombini Shale represent the earliest records of deep-sea bony fish, formations that preserve deepwater shark fossils are also known from later in the Cretaceous. These include the Northumberland Formation of Canada and similarly aged deposits in Angola, both of which preserve fossils of taxa such as hexanchids, chlamydoselachids, and catsharks, which are known from deepwater habitats today but rare in other formations of the time. Paleogene formations with fossil deep-sea shark teeth are known from New Zealand for the middle Paleocene, and formations in Denmark, France, Austria, and Morocco during the Eocene. The Paratethys Sea still supported deepwater sharks and rays into the Miocene, which are preserved in formations in Hungary.\nDuring the Paleogene, some prominent formations that preserve well-articulated specimens of deep-sea bony fish are known. These include the Monte Solane lagerstatte of early Eocene Italy, which preserves a bathypelagic habitat likely deposited under the sea, as well as the late Eocene Pabdeh Formation of Iran. The deep-sea environments preserved by both formations are apparent through their abundance of fossil stomiiform fish. Notable Neogene formations that preserve fossils of deep-sea bony fish are known from the Miocene of Italy, Japan, and California.\nEnvironment.\nIn the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones. In deep water, marine snow is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone. Marine snow includes dead or dying plankton, protists (diatoms), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The \"snowflakes\" grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way, marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: as sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. Since there is no light in the deep sea (aphotic), there is a lack of primary producers. Therefore, most organisms in the bathypelagic rely on the marine snow from regions higher in the vertical column.\nSome deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the lanternfish, ridgehead, marine hatchetfish, and lightfish families, are sometimes termed \"pseudoceanic\" because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably seamounts and over continental slopes. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.\nHydrostatic pressure increases by 1\u00a0atm (0.1\u00a0MPa) for every in depth. Deep-sea organisms have the same pressure within their bodies as is exerted on them from the outside, so they are not crushed by the extreme pressure. Their high internal pressure, however, results in the reduced fluidity of their membranes because molecules are squeezed together. Fluidity in cell membranes increases efficiency of biological functions, most importantly the production of proteins, so organisms have adapted to this circumstance by increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the cell membranes. In addition to differences in internal pressure, these organisms have developed a different balance between their metabolic reactions from those organisms that live in the epipelagic zone. David Wharton, author of \"Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments\", notes \"Biochemical reactions are accompanied by changes in volume. If a reaction results in an increase in volume, it will be inhibited by pressure, whereas, if it is associated with a decrease in volume, it will be enhanced\". This means that their metabolic processes must ultimately decrease the volume of the organism to some degree.\nMost fish that have evolved in this harsh environment are not capable of surviving in laboratory conditions, and attempts to keep them in captivity have led to their deaths. Deep-sea organisms contain gas-filled spaces (vacuoles). Gas is compressed under high pressure and expands under low pressure. Because of this, these organisms have been known to blow up if they come to the surface.\nCharacteristics.\nThe fish of the deep-sea have evolved various adaptations to survive in this region. Since many of these fish live in regions where there is no natural illumination, they cannot rely solely on their eyesight for locating prey and mates and avoiding predators; deep-sea fish have evolved appropriately to the extreme sub-photic region in which they live. Many of these organisms are blind and rely on their other senses, such as sensitivities to changes in local pressure and smell, to catch their food and avoid being caught. Those that aren't blind have large and sensitive eyes that can use bioluminescent light. These eyes can be as much as 100 times more sensitive to light than human eyes. Rhodopsin (Rh1) is a protein found in the eye's rod cells that helps animals see in dim light. While most vertebrates usually have one Rh1 opsin gene, some deep-sea fish have several Rh1 genes, and one species, the silver spinyfin (\"Diretmus argenteus\"), has 38. This proliferation of Rh1 genes may help deep-sea fish to see in the depths of the ocean. Also, to avoid predation, many species are dark to blend in with their environment.\nMany deep-sea fish are bioluminescent, with extremely large eyes adapted to the dark. Bioluminescent organisms are capable of producing light biologically through the agitation of molecules of luciferin, which then produce light. This process must be done in the presence of oxygen. These organisms are common in the mesopelagic region and below ( and below). More than 50% of deep-sea fish, as well as some species of shrimp and squid, are capable of bioluminescence. About 80% of these organisms have photophores \u2013 light producing glandular cells that contain luminous bacteria bordered by dark colourings. Some of these photophores contain lenses, much like those in the eyes of humans, which can intensify or lessen the emanation of light. The ability to produce light only requires 1% of the organism's energy and has many purposes: It is used to search for food and attract prey, like the anglerfish; claim territory through patrol; communicate and find a mate, and distract or temporarily blind predators to escape. Also, in the mesopelagic where some light still penetrates, some organisms camouflage themselves from predators below them by illuminating their bellies to match the colour and intensity of light from above so that no shadow is cast. This tactic is known as counter-illumination.\nThe lifecycle of deep-sea fish can be exclusively deep-water, although some species are born in shallower water and sink upon maturation. Regardless of the depth where eggs and larvae reside, they are typically pelagic. This planktonic \u2014 drifting \u2014 lifestyle requires neutral buoyancy. In order to maintain this, the eggs and larvae often contain oil droplets in their plasma. When these organisms are in their fully matured state they need other adaptations to maintain their positions in the water column. In general, water's density causes upthrust \u2014 the aspect of buoyancy that makes organisms float. To counteract this, the density of an organism must be greater than that of the surrounding water. Most animal tissues are denser than water, so they must find an equilibrium to make them float. Many organisms develop swim bladders (gas cavities) to stay afloat, but because of the high pressure of their environment, deep-sea fishes usually do not have this organ. Instead they exhibit structures similar to hydrofoils in order to provide hydrodynamic lift. It has also been found that the deeper a fish lives, the more jelly-like its flesh and the more minimal its bone structure. They reduce their tissue density through high fat content, reduction of skeletal weight \u2014 accomplished through reductions of size, thickness and mineral content \u2014 and water accumulation makes them slower and less agile than surface fish. The body shapes of deep-sea fish are generally better adapted for periodic bursts of swimming rather than constant swimming.\nDue to the poor level of photosynthetic light reaching deep-sea environments, most fish need to rely on organic matter sinking from higher levels, or, in rare cases, hydrothermal vents for nutrients. This makes the deep-sea much poorer in productivity than shallower regions. Also, animals in the pelagic environment are sparse and food doesn't come along frequently. Because of this, organisms need adaptations that allow them to survive. Some have long feelers to help them locate prey or attract mates in the pitch black of the deep ocean. The deep-sea angler fish in particular has a long fishing-rod-like adaptation protruding from its face, on the end of which is a bioluminescent piece of skin that wriggles like a worm to lure its prey. Some must consume other fish that are the same size or larger than them and they need adaptations to help digest them efficiently. Great sharp teeth, hinged jaws, disproportionately large mouths, and expandable bodies are a few of the characteristics that deep-sea fishes have for this purpose. The gulper eel is one example of an organism that displays these characteristics.\nFish in the different pelagic and deep-water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic vertically migrating plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic anglerfishes, and the deep-water benthic rattails.\nRay finned species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep-sea fishes, which suggests that deep-sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful. The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the Beryciformes and Lampriformes, which are also ancient forms. Most deep-sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep-sea environments. In contrast, deep-water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow-water fishes.\nMesopelagic fish.\nBelow the epipelagic zone, conditions change rapidly. Between 200\u00a0m and about 1000\u00a0m, light continues to fade until there is almost none. Temperatures fall through a thermocline to temperatures between . This is the twilight or mesopelagic zone. Pressure continues to increase, at the rate of one atm (0.1\u00a0MPa) every , while nutrient concentrations fall, along with dissolved oxygen and the rate at which the water circulates.\nSonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during World War II, were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor deep by day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swim bladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon. This phenomenon has come to be known as the deep scattering layer.\nMost mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances, and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder. The swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swim bladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swim bladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between , thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.\nThese fish have muscular bodies, ossified bones, scales, well developed gills and central nervous systems, and large hearts and kidneys. Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill rakers, while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill rakers.\nMesopelagic fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most of them are visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light signals. This adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them.\nMesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines, and use colour to camouflage themselves from other fish. Ambush predators are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display photophores producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.\nThe brownsnout spookfish, a species of barreleye, is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror, as opposed to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes.\nSampling by deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550\u2013660\u00a0million tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans.\nBigeye tuna are an epipelagic/mesopelagic species that eats other fish. Satellite tagging has shown that bigeye tuna often spend prolonged periods cruising deep below the surface during the daytime, sometimes making dives as deep as . These movements are thought to be in response to the vertical migrations of prey organisms in the deep scattering layer.\nBathypelagic fish.\nBelow the mesopelagic zone it is pitch dark. This is the midnight (or bathypelagic zone), extending from to the bottom deep-water benthic zone. If the water is exceptionally deep, the pelagic zone below is sometimes called the lower midnight (or abyssopelagic zone). Temperatures in this zone range from and it is completely aphotic.\nConditions are somewhat uniform throughout these zones; the darkness is complete, the pressure is crushing, and temperatures, nutrients and dissolved oxygen levels are all low.\nBathypelagic fish have special adaptations to cope with these conditions \u2013 they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets, being willing to eat anything that comes along. They prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it. The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic fish are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally expending little energy in movement.\nThe dominant bathypelagic fishes are small bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about long, and not many longer than . They spend most of their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20 percent of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5 percent filters down to the bathypelagic zone.\nBathypelagic fish are sedentary, adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food or available energy, not even sunlight, only bioluminescence. Their bodies are elongated with weak, watery muscles and skeletal structures. Since so much of the fish is water, they are not compressed by the great pressures at these depths. They often have extensible, hinged jaws with recurved teeth. They are slimy, without scales. The central nervous system is confined to the lateral line and olfactory systems, the eyes are small and may not function, and gills, kidneys and hearts, and swim bladders are small or missing. These are the same features found in fish larvae, which suggests that during their evolution, bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through neoteny. As with larvae, these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of energy.\nDespite their ferocious appearance, these forms are mostly miniature fish with weak muscles, and are too small to represent any threat to humans. An exception to the generally small size of bathypelagic fish is the Yokozuna slickhead (\"Narcetes shonanmaruae\"), described in 2021, which is the largest known entirely bathypelagic bony fish at over in length.\nThe swim bladders of deep-sea fish are either absent or scarcely operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep-sea fishes have swim bladders which function while they are young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat.\nA couple of known exceptions are the cusk-eel (\"Holcomycteronus profundissimus\"), retrieved from 7160 meters deep, and the rough abyssal grenadier (\"Coryphaenoides yaquinae\"), found at 7259 meters depth. These species still have functional swim bladders, which allows them to maintain high bone density and strong jaws.\nThe most important sensory systems are usually the inner ear, which responds to sound, and the lateral line, which responds to changes in water pressure. The olfactory system can also be important for males who find females by smell.\nBathypelagic fish are black, or sometimes red, with few photophores. When photophores are used, it is usually to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits, but grab whatever comes close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill rakers which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.\nIt is not easy finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence, where bioluminescent patterns are unique to specific species. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species \"Haplophryne mollis\" bites into the skin of a female, he releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.\nMany forms other than fish live in the bathypelagic zone, such as squid, large whales, octopuses, sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids, but this zone is difficult for fish to live in.\nAdaptation to high pressure.\nAs a fish moves deeper into the sea, the weight of the water overhead exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure on the fish. This increased pressure amounts to about one atm (0.1\u00a0MPa) for every in depth. For a fish at the bottom of the bathypelagic zone, this pressure amounts to about 400 atm (40\u00a0MPa, 6000\u00a0psi).\nDeep-sea organisms possess adaptations at cellular and physiological levels that allow them to survive in environments of great pressure. Not having these adaptations limits the depths at which shallow-water species can operate. High levels of external pressure affects how metabolic processes and biochemical reactions proceed. The equilibrium of many chemical reactions is disturbed by pressure, and pressure can inhibit processes which result in an increase in volume. Water, a key component in many biological processes, is very susceptible to volume changes, mainly because constituents of cellular fluid have an effect on water structure. Thus, enzymatic reactions that induce changes in water organization effectively change the system's volume. Proteins responsible for catalyzing reactions are typically held together by weak bonds and the reactions usually involve volume increases.\nSpecies that can tolerate these depths have evolved changes in their protein structure and reaction criteria to withstand pressure, in order to perform reactions in these conditions. In high pressure environments, bilayer cellular membranes experience a loss of fluidity. Deep-sea cellular membranes favor phospholipid bilayers with a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which induce a higher fluidity than their sea-level counterparts.\nTen orders, thirteen families and about 200 known species of deep-sea fish have evolved a gelatinous layer below the skin or around the spine, which is used for buoyancy, low-cost growth and to increase swimming efficiency by reducing drag.\nDeep-sea species exhibit lower changes of entropy and enthalpy compared to surface level organisms, since a high pressure and low temperature environment favors negative enthalpy changes and reduced dependence on entropy-driven reactions. From a structural standpoint, globular proteins of deep-sea fish due to the tertiary structure of G-actin are relatively rigid compared to those of surface level fish. The fact that proteins in deep-sea fish are structurally different from surface fish is apparent from the observation that actin from the muscle fibers of deep-sea fish are extremely heat-resistant; an observation similar to what is found in lizards. These proteins are structurally strengthened by modification of the bonds in the tertiary structure of the protein which also happens to induce high levels of thermal stability. Proteins are structurally strengthened to resist pressure by modification of bonds in the tertiary structure. Therefore, high levels of hydrostatic pressure, similar to high body temperatures of thermophilic desert reptiles, favor rigid protein structures.\nNa+/K+ -ATPase is a lipoprotein enzyme that plays a prominent role in osmoregulation and is heavily influenced by hydrostatic pressure. The inhibition of Na+/K+ -ATPase is due to increased compression due to pressure. The rate-limiting step of the Na+/K+ -ATPase reaction induces an expansion in the bilayer surrounding the protein, and therefore an increase in volume. An increase in volume makes Na+/K+ -ATPase reactivity susceptible to higher pressures. Even though the Na+/K+ -ATPase activity per gram of gill tissue is lower for deep-sea fishes, the Na+/K+ -ATPases of deep-sea fishes exhibit a much higher tolerance of hydrostatic pressure compared to their shallow-water counterparts. This is exemplified between the species \"C. acrolepis\" (around 2000\u00a0m deep) and its hadalpelagic counterpart \"C. armatus\" (around deep), where the Na+/K+ -ATPases of \"C. armatus\" are much less sensitive to pressure. This resistance to pressure can be explained by adaptations in the protein and lipid moieties of Na+/K+ -ATPase. \nLanternfish.\nSampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. With an estimated global biomass of 550\u2013660 million metric tons, several times the entire world fisheries catch, lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. In the Southern Ocean, Myctophids provide an alternative food resource to krill for predators such as squid and the king penguin. Although these fish are plentiful and prolific, currently only a few commercial lanternfish fisheries exist: these include limited operations off South Africa, in the sub-Antarctic, and in the Gulf of Oman.\nEndangered species.\nA 2006 study by Canadian scientists has found five species of deep-sea fish \u2013 blue hake, spiny eel \u2013 to be on the verge of extinction due to the shift of commercial fishing from continental shelves to the slopes of the continental shelves, down to depths of . The slow reproduction of these fish \u2013 they reach sexual maturity at about the same age as human beings \u2013 is one of the main reasons that they cannot recover from the excessive fishing.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62342", "revid": "122189", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62342", "title": "RSX-11", "text": "Family of computer operating systems\nRSX-11 is a discontinued family of multi-user real-time operating systems for PDP-11 computers created by Digital Equipment Corporation. In widespread use through the late 1970s and early 1980s, RSX-11 was influential in the development of later operating systems such as VMS and Windows NT.\nAs the original \"Real-Time System Executive\" name suggests, RSX was designed (and commonly used) for real time use, with process control a major use. It was also popular for program development and general computing.\nHistory.\nName and origins.\nRSX-11 began as a port to the PDP-11 architecture of the earlier RSX-15 operating system for the PDP-15 minicomputer, first released in 1971.\nThe main architect for RSX-15 (later renamed XVM/RSX) was Dennis \u201cDan\u201d Brevik.\nCommenting on the \"RSX\" acronym, Brevik says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"At first I called the new system DEX-15.\u00a0 It was an acronym for 'Digital's Executive - for the PDP-15.'\u00a0 The homonymic relation between DEC, DEX and deques (used as the primary linkage mechanism in the kernel) appealed to my sense of whimsy.\u00a0 People readily adopted the acronym without question.\n But in a short time I was asked to submit the choice to the corporate legal department for a trademark search and registration.\u00a0 They sent me a memo that DEX was already trademarked by some paper company and I would have to rename the product.\u00a0 I pointed out to them that software and paper mills didn't seem to have a hell of a lot of connection, but they wouldn't budge.\n So I sat down with pencil and paper, and in a few moments came up with better than a dozen candidate acronyms and names.\u00a0 My purpose was to come up with a good acronym and then find some appropriate words to justify it.\u00a0 For example, X always appealed to me as part of an acronym because it is pronounced so forcefully, inferring (at least to me) some power and drama.\u00a0 I used a lot of X's.\u00a0 These potential acronyms were submitted back to the legal department.\u00a0 At the time I had no favorite.\nIn a week or so they came back with a subset of my list that they could accept as trademarks.\u00a0 It was left to me to make the final choice.\nBob Decker and I met in my office one afternoon to discuss the choice.\u00a0 Bob was a marketeer who worked for me.\u00a0 I chalked all the candidates on the blackboard and we started going through them one by one, pronouncing each out loud, savoring the sound, trying to get the feel of each one.\u00a0 After ten minutes or so we had narrowed down the selection to three.\nBob sat back in silence as I kept looking at each acronym, seeing how it flowed off my tongue, what impression it gave me, and most importantly, the overall feeling about it.\u00a0 After three or four minutes a strong feeling came over me about one of them.\u00a0 It really felt right.\u00a0 I looked at Bob and announced, \"It's RSX\".\u00a0 I went to the board and erased all the rest until the only writing left was RSX.\u00a0 It even looked right.\nI have absolutely no memory about the other candidate acronyms.\u00a0 They are lost forever, I suppose.\u00a0 Well, maybe there's just a chance that the legal department kept copies of the correspondence - after all they are lawyers and they seem to hold on to everything (especially my money).\nOh, by the way, the acronym stood for 'Real-Time System Executive.'\u00a0 Years later that was changed to 'Resource Sharing Executive,' which I think is even better.\n...And that is how RSX got its name, on the 3rd floor of building 5 in the old mill.\"\nRSX-11D and IAS.\nThe porting effort first produced small paper tape based real-time executives (RSX-11A, RSX-11C) which later gained limited support for disks (RSX-11B). RSX-11B then evolved into the fully fledged RSX-11D disk-based operating system, which first appeared on the PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45 in early 1973. The project leader for RSX-11D up to version 4 was Henry Krejci.\nWhile RSX-11D was being completed, Digital set out to adapt it for a small memory footprint, giving birth to RSX-11M, first released in 1973. From 1971 to 1976, the RSX-11M project was spearheaded by noted operating system designer Dave Cutler, then at his first project. Principles first tried in RSX-11M appear also in later designs led by Cutler, DEC's VMS and MICA and Microsoft's Windows NT.\nUnder the direction of Ron McLean a derivative of RSX-11M, called RSX-20F, was developed to run on the PDP-11/40 front-end processor for the KL10 PDP-10 CPU.\nMeanwhile, RSX-11D saw further developments: under the direction of Garth Wolfendale (project leader 1972\u20131976) the system was redesigned and saw its first commercial release. Support for the 22-bit PDP-11/70 system was added. Wolfendale, originally from the UK, also set up the team that designed and prototyped the Interactive Application System (IAS) operating system in the UK; IAS was a variant of RSX-11D more suitable for time sharing. Later development and release of IAS was led by Andy Wilson, in Digital's UK facilities.\nRelease dates.\nBelow are estimated release dates for RSX-11 and IAS. Data is taken from the printing date of the associated documentation. General availability date is expected to come closely after. When manuals have different printing dates, the latest date is used. RSX-11S is a proper subset of RSX-11M, so release dates are always assumed to be the same as the corresponding version of RSX-11M. On the other side, RSX-11M Plus is an enhanced version of RSX-11M, so it is expected to be later than the corresponding version of RSX-11M.\nLegal ownership, development model and availability.\nRSX-11 is proprietary software, developed internally by Digital. However a copy of the kernel source is present in every RSX distribution, because it was used during the system generation process. The notable exception to this rule is Micro-RSX, which came with a pre-generated autoconfiguring binary kernel. Full sources was available as a separate product to those who already had a binary license, for reference purposes.\nOwnership of RSX-11S, RSX-11M, RSX-11M Plus and Micro/RSX was transferred from Digital to Mentec Inc. in March 1994 as part of a broader agreement.\nMentec Inc. was the US subsidiary of Mentec Limited, an Irish firm specializing in PDP-11 hardware and software support. In 2006 Mentec Inc. was declared bankrupt while Mentec Ltd. was acquired by Irish firm Calyx in December 2006. The PDP-11 software, which was owned by Mentec Inc. was then bought by XX2247 LLC, which is the owner of the software today. It is unclear if new commercial licenses are possible to buy at this time. Hobbyists can run RSX-11M (version 4.3 or earlier) and RSX-11M Plus (version 3.0 or earlier) on the SIMH emulator thanks to a free license granted in May 1998 by Mentec Inc.\nLegal ownership of RSX-11A, RSX-11B, RSX-11C, RSX-11D, and IAS never changed hands; therefore it passed to Compaq when it acquired Digital in 1998 and then to Hewlett-Packard in 2002. In late 2015 Hewlett-Packard split into two separate companies (HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise), with the intellectual property from DEC ending up at HPE. No new commercial licenses have been issued since at least October 1979 (RSX-11A, RSX-11B, RSX-11C) or 1990 (IAS), and none of these operating systems have ever been licensed for hobbyist use.\nRSX-11M-Plus also ran on PDP-11/44, PDP-11/84, PDP-11/94 (Unibus machines), as well as PDP-11/73, PDP-11/83, and PDP-11/93 (Qbus machines). One of the advantages of RSX-11M-Plus over RSX-11M was that larger programs could be created. This was achieved by having the task builder (the linker) build the program to use the separate instruction and data space feature of some PDP-11 models to put executable code and data into separate address spaces. This also allowed programs to run faster, as it reduced the need for \"overlays\", in which you could overlay object modules at task build time, for very large programs. Overlays were specified in a task build command file.\nVersions.\nClones in the USSR and other Eastern Bloc countries.\nIn 1968, the Soviet Government decided that manufacturing copies of IBM mainframes\nand DEC minicomputers, in cooperation with other COMECON countries, was more practical than pursuing original designs. Cloning of DEC designs began in 1974, under the name of SM EVM ( or ). As happened with ES EVM mainframes based on the System/360 architecture, the Russians and their allies sometimes significantly modified Western designs, and therefore many SM EVM machines were binary-incompatible with DEC offerings at the time.\nA clone of the RSX-11M operating system ran on the Romanian-made CORAL series family of computers (such as CORAL 2030, a clone of PDP-11).\nOperation.\nRSX-11 was often used for general-purpose timeshare computing, even though this was the target market for the competing RSTS/E operating system. RSX-11 provided features to ensure better than a maximum necessary response time to peripheral device input (i.e. real-time processing), its original intended use. These features included the ability to lock a process (called a \"task\" under RSX) into memory as part of system boot up and to assign a process a higher priority so that it would execute before any processes with a lower priority.\nIn order to support large programs within the PDP-11's relatively small virtual address space of 64\u00a0KB, a sophisticated semi-automatic overlay system was used; for any given program, this overlay scheme was produced by RSX's \"taskbuilder\" program (called \"TKB\"). If the overlay scheme was especially complex, taskbuilding could take a rather long time (hours to days).\nThe standard RSX prompt is \"&gt;\" or \"MCR&gt;\", (for the \"Monitor Console Routine\". All commands can be shortened to their first three characters when entered and correspondingly all commands are unique in their first three characters. Only the login command of \"HELLO\" can be executed by a user not yet logged in. \"HELLO\" was chosen as the login command because only the first three characters, \"HEL\", are relevant and this allows a non-logged in user to execute a \"HELP\" command.\nWhen run on certain PDP-11 processors, each DEC operating system displays a characteristic light pattern on the processor console panel when the system is idle. These patterns are created by an idle task running at the lowest level. The RSX-11M light pattern is two sets of lights that sweep outwards to the left and right from the center of the console (inwards if the IND indirect command file processor program was currently running on older versions of RSX). By contrast, the IAS light pattern was a single bar of lights that swept leftwards. Correspondingly, a jumbled light pattern (reflecting memory fetches) is a visible indication that the computer is under load (and the idle task is not being executed). Other PDP-11 operating systems such as RSTS/E have their own distinctive patterns in the console lights.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62345", "revid": "3867343", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62345", "title": "Prune", "text": "Dried plum\nA prune is a dried plum, most commonly from the European plum (\"Prunus domestica\") tree. Not all plum species or varieties can be dried into prunes. Use of the term \"prune\" for fresh plums is obsolete except when applied to varieties of plum grown for drying. In this usage, a prune is the firm-fleshed plum fruit of \"P.\u00a0domestica\" varieties that have a high soluble solids content and do not ferment during drying.\nMost prunes are \"freestone\" cultivars (i.e., the pit is easy to remove), whereas most plums grown for fresh consumption are \"clingstone\" (the pit is more difficult to remove). The sorbitol content of dietary fiber likely provides the laxative effect associated with consuming prunes. Prunes are 64% carbohydrates, including dietary fiber, 2% protein, a rich source of vitamin\u00a0K, and a moderate source of B\u00a0vitamins and dietary minerals.\nProduction.\nMore than 1,000 plum cultivars are grown for drying. The main cultivar grown in the United States is the 'Improved French' prune. Other varieties include 'Sutter', 'Tulare Giant', 'Moyer', 'Imperial', 'Italian', and greengages. Fresh prunes reach the market earlier than fresh plums and are usually smaller in size. The great majority of commercially grown prune varieties are self-fertile and do not need separate pollinator trees.\nName change.\nIn 2001, plum growers in the United States were authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to call prunes \"dried plums\". Due to a perception that prunes relieve constipation (perceived as derogatory), some distributors stopped using the word \"prune\" on packaging labels in favor of \"dried plums\".\nHealth effects.\nPrunes contain dietary fiber (about 7% of weight) which may provide laxative effects, but prune juice also has a laxative effect without containing fiber. Their sorbitol content may also be responsible for this, a conclusion reached in a 2012 review by the European Food Safety Authority. The report also demonstrated that prunes effectively contribute to the maintenance of normal bowel function in the general population if consumed in quantities of at least per day. Neochlorogenic acid and chlorogenic acid may also contribute to the laxative effect.\nNutrition.\nPrunes are 31% water, 64% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat (table). In a reference amount of , prunes supply 240 calories, 7 grams of dietary fiber, and are a rich source of vitamin K (50% of the Daily Value, DV), copper (31% DV), and potassium (24% DV), with several B vitamins (12-14% DV) and other dietary minerals in moderate content (10\u201313% DV) (table).\nPhytochemicals.\nPrunes and prune juice contain phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds (mainly as neochlorogenic acids and chlorogenic acids) and sorbitol.\nUses.\nPrunes are used in preparing both sweet and savory dishes.\nContrary to the name, boiled plums or prunes are not used to make sugar plums, which instead may be nuts, seeds, or spices coated with hard sugar, also called comfits.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In addition to singing and songwriting, he plays accordion, baritone and bass saxophone, clarinet, and keyboards for the group.\nLinnell's lyrics and music art includes strange subject matters and word play, while his music is backed up with generally happy and upbeat melodies.\nEarly life.\nJohn Linnell was born in New York City, to his father Zenos Linnell, (1925\u20132011), a psychiatrist, and his mother Kathleen (n\u00e9e Glenn; 1926\u20132008). When Linnell was a child, Walt Kelly's \"Songs of the Pogo\" album made a strong impression on his musical sensibilities. The album contained lyrics that relied heavily on puns and word play, which Linnell appreciated. In particular, he recalls \"Lines Upon a Tranquil Brow\", which later became part of They Might Be Giants's live repertoire.\nEducation.\nAt an early age, Linnell and his family relocated to Lincoln, Massachusetts, where he attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. There, he worked on the school newspaper, the \"Promethean\", and met John Flansburgh. The two occasionally collaborated on home-recording projects.\nLinnell studied English for a semester at the University of Massachusetts Amherst before dropping out to pursue a career in music.\nMusical career.\nEarly work.\nIn high school, Linnell played with a band called The Baggs. Prior to finding success in the alternative rock scene, Linnell was also involved with The Mundanes, a Rhode Island\u2013based new wave band. Linnell played keyboards and saxophone for the group. Because of his unsatisfactory minor role in the band, and under the pressure of The Mundanes' unsuccessful search for a record deal, Linnell began leisurely recording music with John Flansburgh. His family did not support the transition from what they considered to be a more professional band to an experimental one.\nSince 1982: They Might Be Giants.\nLinnell co-founded They Might Be Giants in 1982 with high school friend John Flansburgh. While the two split singing and songwriting duties roughly in half, Linnell's songs have had the most commercial success in their early years: singles like \"Don't Let's Start\" and \"Ana Ng\" introduced the band to college radio, and they made waves on the \"Billboard\" charts in 1990 with \"Birdhouse in Your Soul\". Linnell writes songs, sings, plays accordion, keyboards, and various woodwind instruments for the band.\nJohn Linnell's lyrics include strange subject matter and word play. Persistent themes include aging, delusional behavior, bad relationships, death, and the personification of inanimate objects. Conversely to some of these dark themes, the accompanying melodies are usually cascading and upbeat.\nLinnell described his role in the group during an interview for \"Splatter Effect\" in 1994:\nIn December 2005, the band began to produce a twice-monthly podcast. Early on, Linnell frequently contributed humorous spoken-word pieces to the program.\nSolo work.\nSince 1994, Linnell has done some solo work: in that year he released the \"State Songs\" EP, which he expanded to a full-length album in 1999. The concept of the \"State Songs\" project is intentionally misleading: U.S. states feature prominently in the title and chorus of each song, but have very little to do with their actual narratives. \"Montana\", for instance, is about the insane ramblings of somebody who is about to die; \"Idaho\" explores a famous rock story in which John Lennon, having consumed hallucinogenic drugs, believed he could drive his house; \"South Carolina\" is about getting rich as a result of a bicycle accident.\nOther side-projects include the limited-release \"House of Mayors\" EP in 1996 through the Hello CD of the Month Club and in 1997 a flexi disc of the song \"Olive the Other Reindeer\" accompanying promotional copies of the children's books, \"Olive, the Other Reindeer\". Linnell has also appeared as a guest musician\u2014often as an accordionist\u2014on a number of musical efforts by other artists, including Suzanne Vega's \"Days of Open Hand\" and David Byrne's \"Grown Backwards\".\nLinnell provided the singing voice for the Other Father character in the 2009 film \"Coraline\", for which They Might Be Giants wrote the \"Other Father Song\", included on the film's soundtrack.\nIn 2021, Linnell released a four-song EP containing original songs sung entirely in Latin, titled \"Roman Songs\".\nFor 2024, he collaborated with Michael Hearst on a cover of the song \"Tele-Tele-Telephone\" by Wazmo Nariz for Hearst's project, \"80 From The 80s\".\nPersonal life.\nLinnell married Karen Brown in 1997 and has one son, Henry, who was born in 1998 and appeared as a performer on They Might Be Giants' children's albums \"Here Come the ABCs\" and \"Here Come the 123s\", as well as his father's solo album \"Roman Songs\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also known for his boyish good looks, which were said to have prompted the Irish poet W. B. Yeats to describe him as \"the handsomest young man in England\". He died of septicaemia following a mosquito bite whilst aboard a French hospital ship moored off the island of Skyros in the Aegean Sea.\nEarly life.\nBrooke was born at 5 Hillmorton Road, Rugby, Warwickshire, and named after a great-grandfather on his mother's side, Rupert Chawner (1750\u20131836), a distinguished doctor descended from the regicide Thomas Chaloner (the middle name has however sometimes been erroneously given as \"Chaucer\"). He was the third of four children of William Parker \"Willie\" Brooke, a schoolmaster, and Ruth Mary Brooke (n\u00e9e\u00a0Cotterill), a school matron. Both parents were working at Fettes College in Edinburgh when they met. They married on 18 December 1879. William Parker Brooke had to resign after the couple wed, as there was no accommodation there for married masters. The couple then moved to Rugby in Warwickshire, where Rupert's father became Master of School Field House at Rugby School a month later. His eldest brother was Richard England \"Dick\" Brooke (1881\u20131907); his sister Edith Marjorie Brooke was born in 1885 and died the following year, and his youngest brother was William Alfred Cotterill \"Podge\" Brooke (1891\u20131915).\nBrooke attended preparatory (prep) school locally at Hillbrow, and then went on to Rugby School. At Rugby, he was romantically involved with fellow pupils Charles Lascelles, Denham Russell-Smith and Michael Sadleir. In 1905, he became friends with St. John Lucas, who thereafter became something of a mentor to him.\nIn October 1906, he went up to King's College, Cambridge, to study classics. There, he became a member of the Apostles, was elected as president of the university Fabian Society, helped found the Marlowe Society drama club and acted, including in the Cambridge Greek Play. The friendships he made at school and university set the course for his adult life, and many of the people he met\u2014including George Mallory\u2014fell under his spell. Virginia Woolf told Vita Sackville-West that she had gone skinny-dipping with Brooke in a moonlit pool when they were in Cambridge together. In 1907, his elder brother Dick died of pneumonia at age 26. Brooke planned to put his studies on hold to help his parents cope with the loss of his brother, but they insisted he return to university.\nThere is a blue plaque at The Orchard, Grantchester, where he lived and wrote. It reads: \"Rupert Brooke Poet &amp; Soldier 1887\u20131915 Lived and wrote at The Orchard 1909\u20131911, and at The Old Vicarage 1911\u20131912\".\nLife and career.\nBrooke made friends among the Bloomsbury group of writers, some of whom admired his talent while others were more impressed by his good looks. He also belonged to another literary group known as the Georgian Poets and was one of the most important of the Dymock poets, associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock where he spent some time before the war. This group included both Robert Frost and Edward Thomas. He also lived at the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, which stimulated one of his best-known poems, named after the house, written with homesickness while in Berlin in 1912. While travelling in Europe, he prepared a thesis, entitled \"John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama\", which earned him a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, in March 1913.\nBrooke had his first heterosexual relationship with \u00c9lisabeth van Rysselberghe, daughter of painter Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe. They met in 1911 in Munich. His affair with \u00c9lisabeth came closest to be consummated than any other he ever had so far. It is possible that the two became lovers in a \"complete sense\" in May 1913 in Swanley. It was in Munich, where he had met \u00c9lisabeth, that a year later he finally succeeded in a sexual liaison with Katherine Laird Cox.\nBrooke suffered a severe emotional crisis in 1912, resulting in the breakdown of his long relationship with Ka Cox. Brooke's paranoia that Lytton Strachey had schemed to destroy his relationship with Cox by encouraging her to see Henry Lamb precipitated his break with his Bloomsbury group friends and played a part in his nervous collapse and subsequent rehabilitation trips to Germany.\nAs part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for \"The Westminster Gazette\". He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the South Seas. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship. Many more people were in love with him. Brooke was romantically involved with the artist Phyllis Gardner and the actress Cathleen Nesbitt, and was once engaged to No\u00ebl Olivier, whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive Bedales School.\nBrooke's accomplished poetry gained many enthusiasts and followers, and he was taken up by Edward Marsh, who brought him to the attention of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. He joined the Royal Navy after the outbreak of war in August 1914, and was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a temporary sub-lieutenant shortly after his 27th birthday. Brooke was assigned to the Royal Naval Division, an infantry division consisting of Royal Navy and Royal Marine personnel not needed at sea, and took part in the siege of Antwerp in early October.\nBrooke came to public attention as a war poet early the following year, when \"The Times Literary Supplement\" published two sonnets (\"IV: The Dead\" and \"V: The Soldier\") on 11 March; the latter was then read from the pulpit of St Paul's Cathedral on Easter Sunday (4 April). His most famous collection of poetry, containing all five sonnets, \"1914 &amp; Other Poems\", was first published in May 1915 and, in testament to his popularity, ran to 11 further impressions that year and by June 1918 had reached its 24th impression, a process undoubtedly fuelled through posthumous interest.\nDeath.\nBrooke sailed with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on 28 February 1915, but developed severe gastroenteritis whilst stationed in Egypt followed by streptococcal sepsis from an infected mosquito bite. French surgeons carried out two operations to drain the abscess, but he died of septicaemia at 4:46\u00a0pm on 23 April 1915, on the French hospital ship \"Duguay-Trouin\", moored in a bay off the Greek island of Skyros in the Aegean Sea, while on his way to the landings at Gallipoli. He was 27 at the time of his death. As the expeditionary force had orders to depart immediately, Brooke was buried at 11\u00a0pm in an olive grove on Skyros. The site was chosen by his close friend, William Denis Browne, who wrote of Brooke's death:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I sat with Rupert. At 4 o\u2019clock he became weaker, and at 4.46 he died, with the sun shining all round his cabin, and the cool sea breeze blowing through the door and the shaded windows. No one could have wished for a quieter or a calmer end than in that lovely bay, shielded by the mountains and fragrant with sage and thyme.\nAnother friend and war poet, Patrick Shaw-Stewart, assisted at his hurried funeral. His grave remains there still, with a monument erected by his friend Stanley Casson, poet and archaeologist, who, in 1921, published \"Rupert Brooke and Skyros\", a \"quiet essay\", illustrated with woodcuts by Phyllis Gardner.\nBrooke's surviving brother, William Alfred Cotterill Brooke, fell in action on the Western Front on 14 June 1915 as a subaltern with the 1/8th (City of London) of the London Regiment (Post Office Rifles), at the age of 24. He had been in France on active service for nineteen days before his death. His body was buried in Fosse 7 Military Cemetery (Quality Street), Mazingarbe.\nIn July 1917, Field Marshal Edmund Allenby was informed of the death in action of his son Michael Allenby, leading to Allenby's breakdown in tears in public while he recited a poem by Rupert Brooke.\nCommemorations.\nOn 11 November 1985, Brooke was among 16 First World War poets commemorated on a slate monument unveiled in Poets' Corner in Westminster Abbey. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen's \"Preface\" to his poems and reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"\nHis name is recorded on the village war memorial in Grantchester.\nThe wooden cross that marked Brooke's grave on Skyros, which was painted and carved with his name, was removed when a permanent memorial was made there. His mother, Mary Ruth Brooke, had the cross brought to Rugby, to the family plot at Clifton Road Cemetery. Because of erosion in the open air, it was removed from the cemetery in 2008 and replaced by a more permanent marker. The Skyros cross is now at Rugby School with the memorials of other Old Rugbeians.\nThe first stanza of \"The Dead\" is inscribed onto the base of the Royal Naval Division War Memorial in London.\nThe Cenotaph in Wellington, New Zealand, has the words from \"The Dead\", \"These laid the world away; poured out the red/Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be/Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,/That men call age; and those who would have been,/Their sons, they gave, their immortality.\" inscribed on the pediment.\nIn 1988, the sculptor Ivor Roberts-Jones was commissioned to produce a statue of Brooke at Regent Place, a small triangular open space, in his birth town of Rugby, Warwickshire. The statue was unveiled by Mary Archer.\nA 2006 portrait statue of Rupert Brooke in army uniform by Paul Day stands in the front garden of The Old Vicarage, Grantchester.\nIn 2023, artist Stephen Hopper painted a portrait in oils celebrating Brooke's life and featuring references to his grave on Skyros and his service with the Hood Battalion, part of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. (See detail on the pencil poised in his hand and the blank sheet of paper, symbolising work unfulfilled). \nLegacy.\nLiterary influences.\nIn the afterword of his \"Collected Poems\" (1919), Lord Alfred Douglas wrote: \"... never before in the history of English literature has poetry sunk so low. When a nation ... can seriously lash itself into enthusiasm over the puerile crudities (when they are nothing worse) of a Rupert Brooke, it simply means that poetry is despised and dishonoured and that sane criticism is dead or moribund.\"\nAmerican adventurer Richard Halliburton made preparations for writing a biography of Brooke but died before he could. Halliburton's notes were used by Arthur Springer to write \"Red Wine of Youth: A Biography of Rupert Brooke\" (1921). Brooke was an inspiration to Canadian fighter pilot John Gillespie Magee Jr., known for his poems \"Sonnet to Rupert Brooke\" (1938) and \"High Flight\" (1941). Brooke also appears as a minor character in A. S. Byatt's novel \"The Children's Book\" (2009).\nMusical influences.\nFrederick Septimus Kelly wrote his \"Elegy, In Memoriam Rupert Brooke for harp and strings\" after attending Brooke's death and funeral. He also took Brooke's notebooks, containing important late poems, for safekeeping and later returned them to England. Brooke's poems have been set to music by groups and individuals including Charles Ives, Marjo Tal and Fleetwood Mac.\nQuotes.\nBrooke's poems are quoted in F. Scott Fitzgerald's debut novel \"This Side of Paradise\" (1920), Princess Elizabeth's Act of Dedication speech (1947), TV series including \"M*A*S*H\" episode \"Springtime\" (1974) and the second episode of \"\" (2022), as well as in films including \"Making Love\" (1982).\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After 1848, when his nephew, Louis Napoleon, became President of the Second French Republic, he served in several official roles, including Marshal of France from 1850 onward, and President of the Senate in 1852. He was the only one of Napoleon's siblings who lived long enough to see the Bonaparte restoration.\nHistorian Owen Connelly points to his financial, military, and administrative successes and concludes he was a loyal, useful, and soldierly asset to Napoleon. Others, including historian Helen Jean Burn, have demonstrated his military failures, including a dismal career in the French navy that nearly escalated into war with Britain over an incident in the West Indies, and his selfish concerns that led to the deaths of tens of thousands during the French invasion of Russia when he failed to provide military support as Napoleon had counted upon for his campaign. Further, J\u00e9r\u00f4me's addiction to spending led to both personal and national financial disasters, with his large personal debts repeatedly paid by family members, including Napoleon, his mother, and both of his first two fathers-in-law. The treasury of Westphalia was emptied. In general, most historians agree that he was the most unsuccessful of Napoleon's brothers.\nEarly life.\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, the eighth and last surviving child (and fifth surviving son) of Carlo Buonaparte and his wife, Letizia Ramolino. His elder siblings were: Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte, Pauline Bonaparte, and Caroline Bonaparte.\nHe studied at the Catholic College of Juilly and Lay College at the Irish College in Paris, and then joined the French Navy in January 1800. Napoleon put him in charge of a French frigate in the West Indies. Fleeing from an incident in which he accidentally shot a British ship and thus could have escalated conflict between the two countries, and fearing his brother's wrath, he fled north under the assumed name of \"Mr. Albert\" to the United States, where he planned to remain until his brother's temper cooled. While there, he amassed considerable debts and was nearly in a duel due to ruining at least one lady's honour. Upon the boast by an old naval friend that Baltimore had the most beautiful women in the U.S., he made his way to that city (July 1803), where he met Elizabeth Patterson, reportedly the most beautiful woman in Baltimore. On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1803, nineteen-year-old J\u00e9r\u00f4me married Elizabeth Patterson (1785\u20131879), who herself was only eighteen. The wedding took place against the bride's father's wishes; William Patterson had received an anonymous letter beforehand which detailed J\u00e9r\u00f4me's womanizing, his massive debts, and his plans to use the marriage only as a way to stay in style in the U.S. until he could return to his family in France.\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me's elder brother Napoleon was furious about the match - he wanted to marry his siblings into royal families across Europe and to expand the Bonaparte dynasty through marriage. He was unable to convince Pope Pius VII in Rome to annul the marriage, and so after becoming Emperor in 1804, he annulled the marriage himself (by a French imperial decree, on 11 March 1805), as a matter of state. At the time, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was on his way to Europe with Elizabeth, who was then pregnant. They landed in neutral Portugal, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me set off to Italy to persuade his brother to recognize the marriage. Elizabeth tried to land in Amsterdam, hoping to enter France so her baby would be born on French soil, but the Emperor barred the ship from entering the harbour. Elizabeth sailed to England instead, and gave birth to her child, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (1805\u20131870), in London. J\u00e9r\u00f4me would not attempt to see his son for two decades.\nThe Emperor followed up his decree of divorce with Roman Catholic and (later) French state divorce proceedings. J\u00e9r\u00f4me submitted to the Emperor's demands and ended his marriage; in return, he was made an admiral in the French Navy (commanding the Genoa Squadron from May 1805), a general in the army, King of Westphalia (r.\u20091807\u00a0\u2013\u00a01813), and an imperial prince, and Napoleon arranged marriage for him to a princess. Elizabeth returned alone to America with her son; she never spoke to J\u00e9r\u00f4me again. Fearing losing control of her son and her finances to J\u00e9r\u00f4me, Elizabeth was later declared divorced from J\u00e9r\u00f4me by a special decree and act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1815.\nKing of Westphalia.\nNapoleon made his brother King of Westphalia, a short-lived realm (1807\u201313) created from several states and principalities in northwestern Germany that had been in the Holy Roman Empire and were now reorganized by Napoleon into the Confederation of the Rhine.\nThe Napoleonic realm of Westphalia had its capital in Kassel (then: Cassel). J\u00e9r\u00f4me was married, as arranged by Napoleon before he was divorced from Elizabeth, to Princess Catharina of W\u00fcrttemberg, the daughter of Frederick I, King of W\u00fcrttemberg. A marriage to a German princess was intended to boost the dynastic standing of the young French king.\nWhen J\u00e9r\u00f4me and Catharina arrived in Kassel, they found the palaces in a plundered state. As such, they placed orders for an array of stately furniture and expensive silverware with leading Parisian manufacturers. Local artisans, eager for commissions, oriented themselves with these French models. The king also intended to refurbish his capital architecturally, and the court theatre ranks among the small number of projects realised. J\u00e9r\u00f4me had it designed by Leo von Klenze and constructed next to the summer residence, previously known as \"Wilhelmsh\u00f6he\", which was changed to \"Napoleonsh\u00f6he\". To emphasize his rank as a ruler, and pander to his own ego, J\u00e9r\u00f4me commissioned grandiose state portraits of himself and his spouse, Queen Catharina. Other paintings were to celebrate his military exploits, with many of France's most prominent painters taken into his employ. His careless spending continued and stripped the treasury of its funds, putting the new kingdom into debt. This reckless disregard for finances would continue for the rest of his life.\nAs a model state, the Kingdom of Westphalia was expected by Napoleon to serve as an example for the other German states. It received the first constitution and parliament to be found on German soil (decades before other parliaments, legislatures, reichstags, bundesrats, etc. such as in Frankfurt in 1848). J\u00e9r\u00f4me imported the Empire style from Paris, bestowing the new state with a modern, representative appearance. The small kingdom thus received more attention since the famous Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years' War a hundred and sixty years earlier in 1648. Thanks to these efforts by King Jerome, Kassel celebrated an enormous cultural upturn.\nHowever, J\u00e9r\u00f4me's expensive habits earned him the contempt of Napoleon and bankrupted his kingdom. His court incurred expenses comparable to Napoleon's court (which oversaw a vastly larger and more important realm), and Napoleon refused to support J\u00e9r\u00f4me financially.\nIn 1812, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was given command of a corps in the \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\", marching towards Minsk. J\u00e9r\u00f4me Insisted on travelling \"in state\". Napoleon reprimanded Jerome for this, ordering him to leave his court and luxurious trappings behind. After the Battle of Mir (1812), J\u00e9rome occupied Mir Castle. In pique at Napoleon's order, J\u00e9r\u00f4me returned with his entire court and train to Westphalia. As a result, tens of thousands of lives were most likely lost during the invasion of Russia. After the defeat in Russia during the following winter, Jerome petitioned Napoleon to allow his wife to go to Paris, fearing the advance of the Allied armies. On the second attempt, Napoleon granted permission.\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me briefly re-entered the army in 1813, when his kingdom was being threatened from the east by the advancing allied Prussian and Russian armies during the German campaign of 1813. He led a small force to challenge their attempt at liberation. Following a clash with an enemy detachment, he made camp with his army, hoping for reinforcements from the French army in the west. However, before reinforcements arrived, the main allied force liberated the capital, Kassel. The Kingdom of Westphalia was declared dissolved, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me's kingship ended. He then fled to join his wife, the former queen, in France. After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 during the War of the Seventh Coalition, the Allies would reorganize the former Westphalian territories along with the rest of the German states into a German Confederation with Austrian leadership.\nThe Hundred Days.\nDuring the Hundred Days, Napoleon placed J\u00e9r\u00f4me in command of the 6th Division of the II Corps under General Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille. At Waterloo, J\u00e9r\u00f4me's division was to make an initial attack on Hougoumont. It is said that Napoleon wished to draw in the Duke of Wellington's reserves. Whatever the intent, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was allowed to enlarge the assault such that his division became completely engaged attempting to take Hougoumont to the exclusion of any other possible deployment, without significantly weakening Wellington's centre. The episode became another in the long line of his military failures.\nLater years.\nAlthough Catharina was aware of J\u00e9r\u00f4me's womanizing and many affairs, she remained true to her husband. They had two sons, Prince J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte (1814\u20131847) and Prince Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte (1822\u20131891), also known as \"Prince Napoleon\" or \"Plon-Plon\". Their second child was a daughter, Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, who was a prominent hostess during and after the Second French Empire of Napoleon III (1852\u201370).\nAfter the dissolution of his kingdom, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was given the title of \"Prince of Montfort\" (French: ) by his father-in-law, King Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg, in July 1816. Previously, King Frederick had forced J\u00e9r\u00f4me and his wife to leave the country in 1814. During their exile, they visited the United States (his second time there). J\u00e9r\u00f4me later returned to France and joined Napoleon during an attempt to restore the Empire during the \"Hundred Days\".\nLater, J\u00e9r\u00f4me moved to Italy, where he married his third wife, Giustina Pecori-Su\u00e1rez. She was the widow of an Italian Marquess, Luigi Bartolini-Baldelli and his mistress during his second marriage.\nIn 1848, his nephew, Prince Louis Napoleon, became President of the French Second Republic. J\u00e9r\u00f4me was made Governor of Les Invalides in Paris, which was the burial place of Napoleon I--a position which provided a large salary for little work due to his debts and his complete lack of success at previous leadership endeavours. When Louis Napoleon became emperor as Napoleon III, J\u00e9r\u00f4me was recognized as the heir presumptive to the re-established imperial throne until the birth of Napol\u00e9on Eug\u00e8ne, Prince Imperial. J\u00e9r\u00f4me was named a Marshal of France in 1850, served as President of the Senate (the upper house in the French Republic's parliament, compared with the lower house of the National Assembly) in 1852, and received the title of \"Prince Fran\u00e7ais\".\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte died on 24 June 1860, at Villegenis, France (today known as Massy in Essonne). He is buried in Les Invalides.\nHis grandson, Charles Joseph Bonaparte (son of Jerome \"Bo\" Napoleon Bonaparte, 1805\u20131870), served as United States Secretary of the Navy and United States Attorney General in President Theodore Roosevelt's administration, 1901\u20131909, and addressed the Supreme Court over 500 times. In 1908, he established a Bureau of Investigation within the 38-year-old Department of Justice. The bureau grew under director J. Edgar Hoover and was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I) in 1935.\nAnother grandson was Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II, (1829\u20131893). In the early 1850s, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, was commissioned an officer in the United States Army, and served with the Mounted Rifles in Texas on the American southwestern frontier. He eventually resigned his commission and joined the forces of his cousin, the Emperor Napoleon III in his Second French Empire.\nAmong J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte's illegitimate children was Baroness Jenny von Gustedt, born as Jerom\u00e9e Catharina Rabe von Pappenheim (1811\u20131890). She became the grandmother of the German Socialist and Feminist writer Lily Braun.\nIn fiction and popular culture.\nThe 1923 German comedy film \"The Little Napoleon\" is loosely based around his life. He is played by Paul Heidemann.\nThe 1928 part-talkie Vitaphone film \"Glorious Betsy\" provides a semi-historical narrative depicting the courtship, marriage, and forced breakup of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte (played by Conrad Nagel) and Elizabeth \"Betsy\" Patterson (played by Dolores Costello).\nIn the \"Hornblower\" television series, he was portrayed by British actor David Birkin. The last episode (\"Duty\") introduces J\u00e9r\u00f4me and Elizabeth ('Betsy'). Adrift in an open boat, they are picked up by Captain Hornblower's ship; J\u00e9r\u00f4me poses as a harmless Swiss citizen, but Hornblower identifies him. After many diplomatic manoeuvres, the British government decides that J\u00e9r\u00f4me is of no political importance after all, and he is allowed to return to France while Elizabeth is put aboard a passing American ship.\nJerome and Betsy's marriage is portrayed in the historical novel \"The Ambitious Madame Bonaparte\" by Ruth Hull Chatlien, published in 2013.\nIn the 1936 film \"Hearts Divided\", Jerome was portrayed by Dick Powell. Elizabeth Patterson was played by Marion Davies, with Claude Rains as Napoleon.\nFamily.\nDescendants of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte and Elizabeth Patterson\nDescendants of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte and Catharina of W\u00fcrttemberg\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the daughter of Baltimore merchant William Patterson and the first wife of J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, Napoleon's youngest brother.\nEarly life.\nPatterson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 6, 1785. She was the daughter of Dorcas (n\u00e9e Spear) Patterson and William Patterson, the oldest daughter of 13 children. Her mother was the daughter of a Baltimore flour merchant, and her father, an Irish-born Presbyterian who came to North America from Donegal before the Revolutionary War, was the second wealthiest man in Maryland after Charles Carroll of Carrollton. \nAlthough writers and journalists refer to her as Betsy, Patterson never used this name, and only her father with whom she had a contentious relationship used it; she always signed her name as Elizabeth, and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte referred to her in all his letters with the French \u00c9lisabeth, \u00c9lisa or Elsa. Patterson was considered one of the more beautiful women in Baltimore and became known for her risqu\u00e9 and French taste in fashion.\nElizabeth's brother, Robert Patterson, married Carroll's granddaughter, Marianne Caton. After Robert's death, his widow Marianne married Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, the older brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Her other brothers, Joseph and Edward Patterson, were the owners of Joppa Iron Works in eastern Baltimore County on the Gunpowder River.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1803, Patterson met J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte on his visit to the United States; he had delayed his return to France to postpone facing the wrath of his brother Napoleon for a military incident in the Caribbean between his ship and a British ship. Several stories of their first meeting circulated, but Patterson later said that they met at a dinner at a friend's house. A romance soon blossomed. Despite an anonymous letter to Patterson's father which claimed that Bonaparte only planned to marry her in order to waste time until he returned to France, Patterson insisted on the marriage, going so far as to threaten to elope if she did not have her father's blessing. On Christmas Eve, 1803, Patterson married J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte in a ceremony presided over by John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop of Baltimore.\nNapoleon ordered his brother back to France and demanded that the marriage be annulled. J\u00e9r\u00f4me ignored Napoleon's initial demand that he return without his wife. In the fall of 1804, J\u00e9r\u00f4me and a pregnant Elizabeth attempted to travel to France in time for his brother's coronation, but a number of false starts delayed them. When they finally arrived, Elizabeth was denied permission to set foot on continental Europe by order of Napoleon. J\u00e9r\u00f4me traveled to Italy in an attempt to reason with his brother, writing to his wife, \"My dearest Elsa, I will do everything that must be done,\" but she never saw him again except for a brief eye-to-eye contact in 1822 in a chance encounter at Pitti Palace in Florence (although, like many stories of her life, historians cannot prove this meeting took place).\nAfter being prevented upon Napoleon's orders from disembarking in either France or the Netherlands, she gave birth to a son, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napoleon Bonaparte (1805\u20131870), on July 5, 1805, at 95 Camberwell Grove in Camberwell, London. Despite letters to his wife that he would remain steadfast and not abandon her, J\u00e9r\u00f4me acquiesced to his brother and was rewarded by being made an admiral in the French navy, a general in the army, an imperial prince and eventually king of Westphalia. He married the German princess Catharina of W\u00fcrttemberg on August 22, 1807, in the Royal Palace at Fontainebleau, France.\nHis marriage to Patterson had been annulled in France by machinations carried out by Napoleon in October 1806 despite the Pope's unwillingness to annul the marriage.\nAfter her son, whom she called Bo, was born, Patterson returned to Baltimore with him and lived with her father, while she continued to use her royal connection to support herself and her son. She wrote to Napoleon and convinced him to grant her an allowance, which she used to support herself after her father claimed what little money and goods Jerome had sent her from Europe before their marriage was annulled. After the Battle of Waterloo, she returned to Europe, where she reportedly was well received in the most exclusive circles and much admired for her beauty and wit.\nDivorce and last years.\nIn 1815, by special act of the Legislature of Maryland, Patterson secured a divorce. She returned to Europe again in 1819 with her son Bo, whom she enrolled in school in Geneva. She traveled to Rome during the winter of 1821\u20131822 at the behest of Pauline Bonaparte, who had hinted at making a financial settlement upon Bo. This news was welcome for Elizabeth as Jerome refused to provide for her and their son. After a failed attempt by Elizabeth and the Bonaparte women to arrange a marriage between Bo and Joseph Bonaparte's youngest daughter Charlotte, she left Rome and returned to Geneva. During a stop in Florence, she visited the Pitti Palace, where she accidentally met Jerome and his second wife Catharina. The two did not speak, but witnesses confirmed that they saw each other and that Jerome was reported as telling Catharina that Elizabeth was his \"American wife.\" Jerome quickly left Florence shortly after the encounter. The two never saw each other again.\nElizabeth split the following decades between Europe and Baltimore, then finally returned to Baltimore. The rifts that had been present between Elizabeth and her family all her life were exacerbated by her marriage and her choices to pursue celebrity in both America and Europe rather than to be an obedient daughter. Her father's rebuke of her in his will and a feud between her and her brothers over her father's estate caused her permanent ostracism from the Patterson family. Her family strife was compounded by her anger at Bo's choice of American heiress Susan May Williams for a wife, a rift that never was resolved.\nIn 1861, she filed an inheritance claim in the Tribunal of First Instance at Paris after her former husband, Prince J\u00e9r\u00f4me, died on June 24, 1860. There was significant pushback against her from J\u00e9r\u00f4me's other children, Mathilde and Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, who regarded her line of the family as bastards. The Tribunal of the Seine eventually ruled that the \"demands of Madame Elizabeth Patterson and her son, Jerome Bonaparte, are not admissible, and must be rejected.\"\nHer last years were spent in Baltimore in the management of her estate, the value of which she increased to $1.5 million. She lived her last years in a Baltimore boarding house despite having enough money to have purchased a fine home. At the end of her life, she commented, \"Once I had everything but money; now I have nothing but money.\"\nPatterson died on April 4, 1879, in Baltimore in the midst of a court battle over whether the state of Maryland could tax her out-of-state bonds. The case reached the Supreme Court (\"Bonaparte v. Tax Court\", 104 U.S. 592). The court decided in favor of Maryland. She was interred in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. Her tomb bears an epitaph: \"After life's fitful fever she sleeps well.\"\nDescendants.\nHer son married Susan May Williams in 1829 and had two children, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (1830\u20131893) and Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1851\u20131921), who became Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of the Navy in 1905 and the U.S. Attorney General in 1906. Her granddaughter Louise Eug\u00e9nie Bonaparte (1883-1923) married Count Adam von Moltke-Huitfeldt (1864-1944). All Patterson's direct descendants now live in Europe, and all of them belong to the Scandinavian aristocracy.\nIn popular culture.\nThe story of Elizabeth and J\u00e9r\u00f4me's marriage and annulment is the basis for the 1908 play \"Glorious Betsy\" by Rida Johnson Young and the two film adaptations, \"Glorious Betsy\" (1928) and \"Hearts Divided\" (1936). She was portrayed by Dolores Costello in the former and by Marion Davies in the latter. The episode \"Duty\" of the \"Hornblower\" television series features Elizabeth (played by Camilla Power) and J\u00e9r\u00f4me trying to land in France, and the diplomatic difficulties. A historical novel about her life, \"The Ambitious Madame Bonaparte\" by Ruth Hull Chatlien, was published in 2013.\nAlexandra Deutsch, director of Collections and Interpretation at the Maryland Historical Society, analyzed Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte's personal belongings and letters in the 2016 book \"A Woman of Two Worlds: Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of Elizabeth Patterson and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon I.\nBiography.\nBonaparte was born in 95 Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, London, but lived in the United States with his wealthy American mother, Elizabeth. His mother's marriage had been annulled by order of J\u00e9r\u00f4me's uncle, Napoleon I. The annulment caused the rescission of his right to carry the Bonaparte name, although the ruling was later reversed by his cousin, Napoleon III.\nHe graduated from Mount St. Mary's College (now Mount St. Mary's University) in 1817 and later received a law degree from Harvard, but did not end up practicing law. He was a founding member of the Maryland Club, serving as its first president.\nIn November 1829, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napoleon married Susan May Williams, an heiress from Baltimore, and it is from them that the American line of the Bonaparte family descended. They had two sons: Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (1830\u20131893), who served as an officer in the armies of both the United States and France, and Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1851\u20131921), who became the United States Attorney General and Secretary of the Navy, and also created the Bureau of Investigation, which was later rechristened the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nJ\u00e9r\u00f4me Napoleon had been refused marriage to his cousin Charlotte, daughter of Joseph Bonaparte. With a growing disdain for Europe and lack of professional ambition, he opted to marry an American heiress, Susan Williams, for the $200,000 fortune she brought to the marriage. In an attempt to match the railroad heiress's dowry, the groom's maternal grandfather, William Patterson \u2014 one of the wealthiest men in Maryland \u2014 gave the couple Montrose Mansion as a wedding gift. Bonaparte died from throat cancer in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 64 and is buried at Loudon Park Cemetery.\nConstitutional issues.\nIt is speculated that J\u00e9r\u00f4me's prospective title and his position in the line of inheritance to Napoleon as Emperor, as well as the title of duchess for his mother Elizabeth Patterson as part of the recompense offered by Napoleon for her divorce to his brother, is a reason the 11th Congress of the United States in 1810 proposed the Titles of Nobility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, fearing that Napoleon would attempt to establish a western kingdom in America. This proposed amendment would have stripped an American of his citizenship if he accepted a title of nobility from a foreign nation. The amendment was not approved; at the time, it lacked the approval of only two state legislatures.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Following the death of his cousin Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial in 1879, he claimed headship of the House of Bonaparte until his death in 1891. An outspoken liberal however, he was passed over as heir in his cousin's final will, which instead chose his elder son Victor, who was favored by most Bonapartists. From the 1880s onwards, he was one of the stronger supporters of General Georges Boulanger, together with other monarchist forces.\nAs well as bearing the title of Prince Napol\u00e9on, given to him by his cousin Emperor Napoleon III in 1852,\nhe was also 2nd Prince of Montfort, 1st Count of Meudon and Count of Moncalieri, following his marriage with Maria Clotilde of Savoy in 1859. His popular nickname, Plon-Plon, stemmed from his difficulty in pronouncing his own name while still a child, although other notable historians and contemporary letters by his nephew Colonel J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte claim it was because he ran in cowardice during battle when the bombs fell. Another nickname, \"Craint-Plomb\" (\"Afraid-of-Lead\",) was given to him by the army due to his absence from the Battle of Solferino.\nBiography.\nBorn at Trieste in the Austrian Empire (today Italy), and known as \"Prince Napol\u00e9on\", \"Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me,\" or by the sobriquet of \"Plon-Plon\", he was a close advisor to his first cousin, Napoleon III of France, and in particular was seen as a leading advocate of French intervention in Italy on behalf of Camillo di Cavour and the Italian nationalists. Until Napoleon III produced an heir apparent, the Bonaparte family were at odds for who should be the heir presumptive, a matter complicated by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte's first marriage to American Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, with whom he had a son, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte. A meeting of the Bonaparte family, presided over by Napoleon III, determined that J\u00e9r\u00f4me Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte and his descendants would be excluded from the line of succession, making Prince Napol\u00e9on the heir presumptive.\nAn anti-clerical liberal, he led that faction at court and tried to influence the Emperor to anti-clerical policies, against the contrary influence of the Emperor's wife, the Empress Eug\u00e9nie, a devout Catholic and a conservative, and the patroness of those who wanted French troops to protect the Pope's sovereignty in Rome. The Emperor was to navigate between the two influences throughout his reign.\nWhen his cousin became president in 1848, Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain. He later served in a military capacity as general of a division in the Crimean War, as Governor of Algeria, and as a corps commander in the French Army of Italy in 1859. His residency in Paris, the Maison pomp\u00e9ienne, was renowned for its Roman style architecture.\nAs part of his cousin's policy of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia, in 1859 Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me married Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. However this did not prevent a nine-year relationship with the courtesan Cora Pearl. \nWhen Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial died in 1879, Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me became, genealogically, the most senior member of the Bonaparte family, but the Prince Imperial's will excluded him from the succession, nominating Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me's son Victor as his successor. As a result, Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me and his son quarreled for the remainder of Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me's life. In his final will, Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me excluded Victor as his heir, declaring him \"a traitor and a rebel\", instead nominating his younger son Louis as his successor.\nPrince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, upon being banished from France by the 1886 law exiling heads of the nation's former ruling dynasties, settled at Prangins on the shores of Lake Geneva, in Vaud, Switzerland where, during the Second Empire, he had acquired a piece of property. The assets he left his heir were extremely modest: Besides the Villa Prangins and the adjoining estate of 75 hectares, estimated at 800,000 francs of the time, approximately 130 million of France's old francs, they were limited to a portfolio valued at 1,000,000 (1891) francs, about 160 million old francs.\nPrince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me died in Rome in 1891, aged 68.\nIssue.\nHe and Princess Maria Clotilde had three children:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}
{"id": "62361", "revid": "44105803", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62361", "title": "Sable Island", "text": "Island in Nova Scotia, Canada\nSable Island (, literally \"island of sand\") is an island in the North Atlantic Ocean, about southeast of Halifax, Canada and about southeast of the closest point of mainland Nova Scotia. The island is staffed year-round by employees of Canada's National Parks agency, Parks Canada. The number of people on Sable Island fluctuates throughout the year, rising during the summer months when the island is frequented by researchers and an increased staff complement. Notable for its role in early Canadian history and the Sable Island horse, the island is protected and managed by Parks Canada, which must grant permission prior to any visit. Sable Island is part of District 7 of the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia. The island is also a protected National Park Reserve and an Important Bird Area.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe expedition of Portuguese explorer Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes explored this region in 1520\u20131521 and his expedition was among the first Europeans to encounter the island. It is likely that he named the island \"Fagunda\" after himself. An island called \"Fagunda\" appears on later Portuguese maps placed to the southeast of Cape Breton, fairly near its present location; however, the identification of Sable Island with Fagunda is not certain. On the other hand, 16th-century Portuguese sources describe a fishing colony founded by the navigator in Cape Breton Island, farther north. It is also possible that Fagundes sighted the island while heading southwest, reaching the Bay of Fundy, as the 1558 map of Diogo Homem and later Samuel de Champlain suggested, but this is unclear. The island was inhabited sporadically by sealers, shipwreck survivors, and salvagers known as \"wreckers\".\nTroilus de La Roche de Mesgouez attempted to colonize the treeless and stoneless Sable Island with a group of convicts and soldiers in 1598. Most of the settlers died in a mutiny, but a few managed to survive in mud dwellings for five years before being returned to France in 1603.\nShipwrecks.\nSable Island is famous for its large number of shipwrecks. An estimated 350 vessels are believed to have fallen victim to the island's sand bars. Thick fogs, treacherous currents, and the island's location in the middle of a major transatlantic shipping route and rich fishing grounds account for the large number of wrecks. The first recorded wreck was the English ship in 1583, part of Humphrey Gilbert's expedition to Newfoundland. There were at least three incidents of shipwrecks in the 1700s. In 1736, a well-known Presbyterian preacher, the Irish-born Reverend Robert Dunlap (1715\u20131776), wrecked on the island on his way to America. Decades later, there were two major shipwrecks: In November 1760, Major Robert Elliot (1715\u00a0\u2013 after 1765) of the 43rd regiment was shipwrecked on Sable Island; he was rescued in January 1761. En route to Prince Edward Island under the command of Major Timothy Hierlihy, Lieutenant Anthony Kennedy and 25 men wrecked on the island in November 1778. The crew was stranded on the island for the winter. Two died, and the remainder were rescued and transported to Halifax the following April. It is likely that the construction of lighthouses on each end of the island in 1873 contributed to the decrease in shipwrecks.\nThe last major shipwreck was the steamship USS \"Manhasset\" in 1947. Her crew were all saved, the last significant rescue of the Sable lifesaving station. After the 1991 Perfect Storm, the commercial fishing vessel \"Andrea Gail\"'s emergency position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) was discovered on the shore of Sable Island on November 6, 1991, nine days after the last transmission from the crew. Other items found were fuel drums, a fuel tank, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam. No crew members have been found, and all are presumed to have perished. No further wrecks occurred until 1999, when the three crew members of the yacht \"Merrimac\" survived after their sloop ran aground due to a navigational error. Few of the wrecks surrounding the island are visible, as they are usually crushed and buried by the sand. On July 12, 2024, the bodies of Briton Sarah Packwood and her Canadian husband Brett Clibbery were found in a lifeboat that washed up on Sable Island; they had left Nova Scotia June 11, 2024, on their sail yacht \"Theros\" trying to sail to the Azores and had been reported missing June 18, 2024.\nThe Nova Scotia Rescue Station.\nA series of life-saving stations were established on Sable Island by the governor of Nova Scotia, John Wentworth, in 1801. The rescue station began the continuous human presence on the island which continues today. Wentworth appointed James Morris, a Nova Scotian veteran of the British Royal Navy as the first superintendent of the island. Morris settled on the island in October 1801 with his family. By the time Morris died on the island in 1809, he had built up the humanitarian settlement to include a central station, two rescue boat stations, several lookout posts and survivor shelters. The station's rescue equipment was upgraded in 1854 with the latest generation of self-bailing lifeboats and life cars through the fundraising efforts of social reformer Dorothea Dix who had visited the island in the previous year.\nAfter Confederation and creation of a weather station.\nThe island became property of the federal government during Canadian Confederation in 1867, with the Island being specifically referenced in an appendix to the British North America Act. The federal government later added two lighthouses in 1872: Sable Island East End Light (cylindrical skeletal tower built 1980s, replacing earlier iterations from 1873, 1888, 1917 and 1951) on the eastern tip and Sable Island West End Light (pyramidal skeletal tower built 1979 replacing earlier towers from 1873, 1903 and 1935) on the western end. Until the advent of modern ship navigation, Sable Island was home to the families of the life-saving crews and the lighthouse keepers. In the early 20th century, the Marconi Company established a wireless station on the island and the Canadian government similarly established a weather station. Several generations of island staff were born and raised families of their own on the island, although a decline in shipwrecks gradually reduced the size of the lifesaving community. Only two people have been born on Sable Island since 1920.\nImprovements in navigation led to a dramatic drop in shipwrecks by the mid 20th century. As such, the rescue station on Sable was reduced and eventually closed in 1958. The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) first automated in the 1960s and eventually decommissioned the West light station in 2004 leaving only the East lighthouse active. However, during this period, the island's role in science grew, first in weather research. The Canadian government expanded the collection of weather data originally started by the rescue station into a full meteorological station operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The station conducted routine atmospheric and meteorological studies from a permanently occupied station on Sable Island until August 20, 2019. In addition to weather studies, research on the island expanded to a range of ecological and wildlife studies due to its position in the Atlantic.\nSable Island is specifically mentioned in the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly the British North America Act 1867, Part 4, Section 91 as being the special responsibility of the federal government (\"the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to ... 9. Beacons, Buoys, Lighthouses, and Sable Island\"). For this reason it is considered a separate amateur radio \"entity\" (equivalent to a country for award credit), and with visiting operations using the special call sign prefix CY0. Because it is a separate radio entity, Sable Island is a popular DX-pedition destination.\nOut of concern for preserving the island's frail ecology, all visitors to the island, including recreational boaters, require specific permission from Parks Canada. Sable Island's heliport contains emergency aviation fuel for search and rescue helicopters, which use the island to stage further offshore into the Atlantic. When the Sable Offshore Energy Project was active, the island was designated as an emergency evacuation point for crews aboard nearby drilling rigs. In 2017, ExxonMobil began the plugging and abandonment of the production wells in the Thebaud field (the Sable Offshore Energy Project wells closest to Sable Island); all facilities were removed by November 2020.\nNational Park Reserve.\nOn October 17, 2011, the Nova Scotia government entered into an agreement with the federal government to eventually protect the island as a national park. The news followed an announcement made by the federal government in May 2010, increasing the level of protection the island receives by transferring control from the Canadian Coast Guard to Parks Canada, which manages the island under the Canada National Parks Act. The establishment of the park reserve means that the island, and the surrounding area within , cannot be drilled for oil or natural gas.\nSable Island became a National Park Reserve on June 20, 2013, with approval of Mi'kmaq stakeholders. Full national park status has yet to be achieved, pending settlement of Indigenous land claims. The park is home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna including a breed of the Sable Island horse. The park is also a breeding ground for marine life.\nIn July 2016, a hike across Sable Island was added to Google Street View. Google worked with the park service to add the interactive views of Sable, as well as five national parks across the country. The imagery was collected in September 2015 by a Parks employee who carried a backpack version of the Street View car camera around an area on the centre of the island, part of Google's Trekker program which explores off-road scenic locations. The route follows a hiking route that the park service uses to escort adventure tourists.\nGeography.\nSable Island is a narrow, crescent-shaped sandbar with a surface area estimated around . Despite being approximately long, it is only across at its widest point. The maximum elevation is about . The long crescent-shaped island rises gently from the shallows of the continental shelf approximately east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its location, in tandem with the area's frequent fog and sudden strong storms (such as hurricanes and nor'easters), have resulted in over 350 recorded shipwrecks. It is often referred to as \"the Graveyard of the Atlantic\", as it sits astride the great circle route from North America's east coast to Europe. The nearest landfall is to the northwest near Canso, Nova Scotia.\nSable Island is believed to have formed from a terminal moraine deposited on the continental shelf near the end of the last Ice Age. It is slowly moving as waves erode the western shore and new sand is added on the eastern shore, and continually changing shape through the effects of strong winds and violent ocean storms.\nThe island has several freshwater ponds on the south side between the station and west light; however, in recent years their protecting dune-line has been eroded to such an extent that they are changing from one year to the next. In prior years, a brackish lake named Lake Wallace existed in the centre of the south beach. At its largest, it extended for many miles; during World War II, amphibious aircraft landed on it. Over the years, the lake shrank with an infilling of sand, until in late 2011, it filled in entirely and disappeared. Since the south beach is subject to flooding during fall storms, photos often show water in the area around the former location of Lake Wallace; however, this flooded area is relatively shallow (only a few feet at most) and is not a remnant of the lake. The original lake was of a significant enough depth that even during times when the area was flooded, the lake could be seen in aerial photographs as a darker (deeper) patch in the middle of the flooded area.\nThe island is a part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, the federal electoral district of Halifax, and the provincial electoral district of Halifax Citadel, although the urban area of Halifax proper is some away on the Nova Scotian mainland.\nClimate.\nSable Island has an Maritime temperate climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cfb\") using the isotherm, or a warm-summer humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Dfb\") using the with its climate being strongly influenced by the sea. As such, winter temperatures average near freezing while during the summer months, daily maximum temperatures average around . The average annual variation in temperature on Sable Island is only owing to the influence from the sea compared to at Halifax and in Winnipeg. Generally, February is the coldest month while August is the warmest month.\nSable Island averages of precipitation a year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though October through January are the wettest months due to frequent and intense fall and winter storms. Being located in the path of major frontal storms and tropical cyclones year-round, most of the precipitation comes from these storms. Thunderstorms are occasional, and happen on an average of 11 days per year. There are frequent heavy fogs in the area due to the contrasting effects of the cold Labrador Current and the warm Gulf Stream: on average there are 127 days out of the year that have at least 1 hour of fog. This makes Sable Island the foggiest place in the Maritimes. The foggiest season is during the summer months where July averages 22 fog days.\nDuring the winter, Sable Island has the warmest temperatures in Canada apart from the Pacific Coast and can have the warmest temperatures in the country on some occasions due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. Due to its maritime influence, snowfall is infrequent before late December, mainly falling occasionally in the three months from January to March. Although when it does fall it usually lies on the ground for no more than a few days at a time.\nSummers are among the coolest in southern Canada though. It is also the most hurricane-prone part of Canada, also due to the Gulf Stream, and is the only place where Saffir\u2013Simpson scale Category 3 hurricane-force winds are likely in all of Canada. The highest temperature recorded was on August 27, 1951, while the lowest temperature recorded was on January 31, 1920.\nAccording to Atlas Obscura, Sable Island lies in hardiness zone 8a () for plant hardiness.\nClimate change.\nBeing a large low-lying sandbar, Sable Island is vulnerable to sea level rise. This is further exacerbated by an ongoing increase in storm frequency and intensity caused by climate change, further eroding the island. These factors point toward Sable Island disappearing by the end of the 21st century.\nVegetation and wildlife.\nSable Island derived its name from the French word for \"sand\". It lacks natural trees, being covered instead with marram grass and other low-growing vegetation. In 1901, the federal government planted over 80,000 trees in an attempt to stabilize the soil; all died. Subsequent plantings in the 1960s resulted in the survival of a single Scots pine, that only grew to a few feet tall. It was decorated yearly as a Christmas tree in December as part of a tradition among the station staff. In recent years, the tree was found to have died, marking the loss of the last remaining pine tree on the island.\nVegetation communities on Sable Island are largely grassland and heathland communities. Grassland areas on the island are dominated by American marram grass, which plays an important role in stabilizing the island's dunes. Sable Island's heathland communities are composed of shrub species such as black crowberry, northern bayberry, and creeping juniper. Other plants found on Sable Island include Virginia rose, seaside goldenrod, sea pea, and American cranberry. \nThe island is home to over 550 free-roaming horses according to a 2016 report, protected by law from human interference. During a 2017\u20132018 study, the estimated population was 500 horses, up from the roughly 300 recorded in the 1970s. Because of the harsh spring of 2017, the mortality rate was about 10% but the normal rate is about 1% annually, primarily due to starvation and hypothermia.\nThis feral horse population is likely descended from horses confiscated from Acadians during the Great Expulsion and left on the island by Thomas Hancock, Boston merchant and uncle of John Hancock. In the early 1800s, many of the horses were used by men patrolling the island, searching for ships in distress, and the animals also moved lifeboats and equipment to sites of shipwrecks.\nIn 1879, 500 horses and cattle were estimated to live on the island, and the island vegetation was described as covered with grass and wild peas. In the past, excess horses were rounded up, shipped off the island, and sold, many used in coal mines on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. In 1960, the Canadian Government, under the \"Canada Shipping Act\", gave the horse population full protection from human interference. This was partly motivated by a plan in the 1950s, eventually aborted due to public pressure, to remove the horses from the island, after some biologists reported that they were damaging the ecology of the land. Nonetheless, some continued to view the horses as an invasive species which is not suitable in a protected region where ecological integrity should be preserved according to the National Parks Act.\nSable Island is home to the world's largest colony of grey seals, which congregate on the island every winter in the hundreds of thousands. Both grey seals and Harbour seals breed on the island's shores. Seal counts from the 1960s for the grey seal population estimated 200\u2013300 pups born at that time on the island, but surveys from as recent as 2016 estimated the number of pups born in that season at 87,500. The seals are occasionally preyed upon by the various shark species that inhabit the waters nearby. Unusual corkscrew bite wounds on dead seals suggest that the Greenland shark is probably responsible for most attacks here.\nSeveral large bird colonies are resident, including the Arctic tern and Ipswich sparrow, a subspecies of the Savannah sparrow which breeds only on the island. Many other species are resident, migratory, or transient, blown out to sea in storms and returned to land out of their natural range.\nIt was formerly believed the freshwater sponge \"Heteromeyenia macouni\", a freshwater sponge, was found only in ponds on the island. However, it is now considered to be the same species as \"Racekiela ryderi\", found elsewhere.\nOver the centuries, many different types of livestock were imported to the island by the various groups of settlers who travelled there. Cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and horses were historically kept on the island (by at least the late 1700s) as a food resource. With no natural predators on the island, livestock animals were often allowed to roam freely. While not mentioned in the earliest records, later records kept by people living on Sable Island also mention chickens. Today, the only livestock animals remaining on the island are horses, which exist in an entirely wild state.\nHistorically, there was a population of walrus on the island, which may have served as a breeding ground for the animal's northwestern Atlantic population. Eyewitness accounts from the 1600s described the animal as being abundant at that time. Throughout the 1700s and 1800s, walrus in the northwestern Atlantic were heavily hunted for their ivory, as well as for their fat and hides. This population was eventually driven to extirpation throughout the region. The last record of walrus on Sable Island dates to the late 1800s. Evidence of the island's former walrus population can still be found today when centuries old skeletal remains like tusks and skulls are revealed by the island's shifting sands.\nSable Island is home to a community of terrestrial invertebrates, with at least six species that are endemic to the island. Several lepidopterans found on Sable Island may represent distinct subspecies from populations found on the mainland. The halictid, \"Lasioglossum sablense\", or the Sable Island sweat bee, is a species endemic to Sable Island.\nSable Island Station.\n.&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe Sable Island Main Station, managed and staffed by Parks Canada, is the only permanently staffed facility on the island. Climatological record-keeping on Sable Island began in 1871 with the establishment of the Meteorological Service of Canada, and ran continuously from 1891 until August 20, 2019.\nSable Island has been the subject of extensive scientific research over the years. The Meteorological Service of Canada operated a wide range of manual and automated instruments, including the Automated Weather Observing System, an aerology program measuring conditions in the upper atmosphere using a radiosonde carried aloft by a hydrogen-filled weather balloon to altitudes beyond , and a program collecting data on background levels of carbon dioxide, which began there in 1974. Research was done to monitor the long-range transport of pollution aerosols. Fog chemistry has also been studied, examining the transport and composition of atmospheric toxins it carries. Tropospheric ozone was measured and analyzed by researchers in Canada and the United States along with 20 other North American sites. The upper-air aerology program ended on August 20, 2019.\nThe installation of the BGS Magnetic Observatory on Sable Island was funded as a joint venture between the British Geological Survey, Sperry-Sun Drilling Services, and Sable Offshore Energy. The data it collects aid scientific research into rates of change of the Earth's magnetic field and increase the accuracy of the BGS Global Geomagnetic Model. Data from the geomagnetic observatory is used by the offshore energy industry for precise positioning activities such as directional drilling.\nSupplies are delivered to the Sable Island Station approximately twice a month by Sable Aviation using a Britten-Norman Islander. Although the island has a heliport (CST5) with an diameter concrete pad, there is no permanent runway for fixed wing aircraft, which land instead on the south beach in an area designated as the Sable Island Aerodrome (CSB2). Prior permission is required to land, as the area is often unusable due to changing sand conditions.\nIn popular culture.\nThe landscape, history of shipwrecks, and wildlife, especially horses, have made Sable Island an iconic place in Atlantic Canada and attracted considerable international following.\nIn non-fiction.\nShipwreck survivors published early survival narratives about their experiences at Sable Island, beginning with the sinking of the \"Delight\" in 1583. The first formal history of the island, \"Sable Island: its History and Phenomena\", was written in 1894 by George Patterson. Many other histories of the island and its shipwrecks have been published since, such as Lyall Campbell's two books \u2013 \"Sable Island, Fatal and Fertile Crescent\" in 1974 and \"Sable Island Shipwrecks: Disaster and Survival at the North Atlantic Graveyard\" in 1994 \u2013 and more recently, \"A Dune Adrift: The Strange Origins and Curious History of Sable Island\", written in 2004 by Marq de Villiers. In his 1997 book, \"The Perfect Storm\", Sebastian Junger briefly describes the geography and history of the island. Joshua Slocum describes Sable Island in \"Sailing Alone Around the World\" during his 1895 solo circumnavigation.\nIn fiction.\nThe island has also inspired works of fiction beginning in 1802 when Nova Scotia author Thomas Chandler Haliburton published \"The Sable Island Ghost\", a story about a ghostly woman inspired by the loss of the brig \"Francis\" in 1798. His story helped raise support for the establishment of a rescue station on the island. Canadian writer James Macdonald Oxley wrote a youth novel \"The Wreckers of Sable Island\" in 1897. Frank Parker Day's 1928 novel \"Rockbound\" features a vivid depiction of the sinking of the schooner \"Sylvia Mosher\" during the 1926 Nova Scotia hurricane at Sable Island. One of the island's most notable temporary residents was Nova Scotian author Thomas Head Raddall, whose early experiences working at the wireless post there served as the inspiration for his 1950 novel \"The Nymph and the Lamp\". In his novel \"The Templar Throne,\" published in June 2010, author Paul Christopher mentions the island as the final location of the Ark of the Covenant, the True Ark of the Christian Old Testament.\nIn photography.\nThe dunes and horses of Sable Island have drawn many photographers. Among the first was Arthur Williams McCurdy who photographed the island, its horses and shipwrecks in 1898 for \"National Geographic\" during a visit with Alexander Graham Bell. A further \"National Geographic\" visit in the summer of 1964 yielded an article entitled \"Sable Island; Graveyard of the Atlantic\". In more recent times, Roberto Dutesco, a fashion photographer, began taking photos of Sable horses in 1994 and features this work in a permanent photo exhibition entitled \"Wild Horses of Sable Island\" at his gallery in New York. Nova Scotian photographer Paul Illsley's photographs of Sable Island horses inspired both a Canadian stamp and coin in 2005.\nIn music.\nIn 1970 Stompin' Tom Connors published his song \"Sable Island\" in 1970's \"Stompin' Tom Meets Big Joe Mufferaw\". Canadian folk singer Catherine McKinnon recorded a song arranged by Don Gillis also entitled \"Sable Island\" for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1975. The first line of the Buck 65 song \"Blood of a Young Wolf\" is \"Ten thousand horses, Sable Island, endless summer.\"\nIn documentaries.\nThe island has been the subject of many Canadian documentaries by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the National Film Board of Canada, beginning with the 1956 NFB film \"Sable Island\" by Allan Wargon, the 2003 NFB documentary \"Moving Sands\" by Phillipe Baylaucq, and more recently, an episode of \"Land and Sea\". In 2002 a documentary was released called \"Catching a Killer: The Mystery of Sable Island\" which investigated the possibility that Greenland sharks were to blame for the corkscrew lacerations on dead seals found washed up on the island. A recent work about Sable Island is the 2015 Canadian-produced film, \"S(t)able Island: The Beauty of the Free\", created by Rae-Anne LaPlante. The film explores in-depth the wild horse population that has called Sable Island its home for over 250 years. A number of international documentaries have also explored the island, including the 2007 film made by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ducrocq and Malek Sahraoui for France 3, French public television. In 2007, Matt Trecartin of Halifax directed \"Chasing Wild Horses\", a documentary about photographer Roberto Dutesco and his photography of the Sable Island horses.\nThe most recent effort is a Canadian documentary film by Jacquelyn Mills, titled \"Geographies of Solitude\", released in 2022. The 103-minute film features Zoe Lucas, an environmentalist and naturalist who lives on the island and studies the wild Sable Island horse.\nIn other films.\nIn the 1937 film \"Captains Courageous\", the fishing boat passes Sable Island on the way to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Spencer Tracy's character Manuel later says his father died off Cape Sable. Sable Island is briefly featured in the 2000 feature film \"The Perfect Storm\", which depicts the sinking of the fishing vessel \"Andrea Gail\" near Sable, although the island is erroneously portrayed with trees and a giant stone lighthouse. Sable Island is the setting for the 2002 film \"Touching Wild Horses\" starring Jane Seymour; however, little attempt was made to mimic the natural landscape of Sable, with trees and rocks abounding in the background of most every scene. Instead, Sandbanks Provincial Park in Ontario stood in for the island in the film.\nIn exhibits.\nA permanent exhibit about Sable Island is featured at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, which includes two rescue boats from Sable and numerous name boards and figureheads from Sable Island wrecks. Another permanent exhibit about Sable Island, exploring its ecology and the on-island researchers' work, is found at the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History. The horses were featured in a 1994 exhibit at the Equine Museum of Japan in Yokohama.\nOn radio.\nOn September 11, 2014, Don Connolly of CBC Radio's Information Morning broadcast part of the daily current affairs program from Sable Island. It was the first ever live public radio broadcast from the island.\nIn amateur radio, Sable Island is considered a separate country with the call sign prefix CY0. Since enthusiasts collect contacts from different countries and there are few inhabitants on Sable Island, a contact from there would be considered a \"rare DX\". As a result, a number of private expeditions (known as DX-peditions) to operate temporary radio stations on Sable Island have been mounted. The most recent DX-pedition is CY0S, which took place in March 2023. There have also been DXpeditions in October 2012 (CY0), March 2011 (CY0), July 2008 (CY0X), November 2002 (CY0MM), October 1995 (CY0TP), and October 1975 (VX9A).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62363", "revid": "485110", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62363", "title": "James Boswell", "text": "Scottish lawyer, diarist and author (1740\u20131795)\nJames Boswell, 9th Laird of Auchinleck (; 29 October 1740 (N.S.) \u2013 19 May 1795), was a Scottish biographer, diarist, and lawyer, born in Edinburgh. He is best known for his biography of the English writer Samuel Johnson, \"Life of Samuel Johnson,\" which is commonly said to be the greatest biography written in the English language. A great mass of Boswell's diaries, letters, and private papers were recovered from the 1920s to the 1950s, and their publication by Yale University has transformed his reputation.\nEarly life.\nBoswell was born in Blair's Land on the east side of Parliament Close behind St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh on 29 October 1740 (N.S.). He was the eldest son of a judge, Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, and his wife Euphemia Erskine. As the eldest son, he was heir to his family's estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire. Boswell's mother was a strict Calvinist, and he felt that his father was cold to him. As a child, he was delicate. Kay Jamison, Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, in her book \"Touched with Fire\", believes that Boswell may have suffered from bipolar disorder, and this condition would afflict him sporadically all through his life. At the age of five, he was sent to James Mundell's academy, an advanced institution by the standards of the time, where he was instructed in English, Latin, writing and arithmetic.\nThe eight-year-old Boswell was unhappy there, and suffered from nightmares and extreme shyness. Consequently, he was removed from the academy and educated by a string of private tutors. The most notable and supportive of these, John Dunn, exposed Boswell to modern literature, such as \"The Spectator\" essays, and religion. Dunn was also present during Boswell's serious affliction of 1752, when he was confined to the town of Moffat in northern Dumfriesshire. This afforded Boswell his first experience of genuine society. His recovery was rapid and complete, and Boswell may have decided that travel and entertainment exerted a calming therapeutic effect on him.\nAt thirteen, Boswell was enrolled into the arts course at the University of Edinburgh, studying there from 1753 to 1758. Midway through his studies, he suffered an episode of serious depression but recovered fully. Boswell had swarthy skin, black hair and dark eyes; he was of average height, and he tended to plumpness. His appearance was said to be alert and masculine.\nUpon turning nineteen, he was sent to continue his studies at the University of Glasgow, where he attended the lectures of Adam Smith. While at Glasgow, Boswell decided to convert to Catholicism and become a monk. Upon learning of this, his father ordered him home. Instead of obeying, though, Boswell ran away to London, where he spent three months, living the life of a libertine, before he was taken back to Scotland by his father. Upon returning, he was re-enrolled at Edinburgh University and forced by his father to sign away most of his inheritance in return for an allowance of \u00a3100 a year.\nTo London and Europe.\nOn 30 July 1762, Boswell passed his oral law exam, after which his father decided to raise his allowance to \u00a3200 a year and permitted him to return to London. Boswell had started keeping a careful journal, written in full, and the volume covering this period was published in 1950 as the \"London Journal\". On 16 May 1763, Boswell met Johnson for the first time. The pair became friends almost immediately, though Johnson became more of a parental figure in Boswell's eyes.\nIn Boswell's \"Life of Johnson\", he records the first conversational exchange between himself and Johnson as follows:\n[Boswell:] \"Mr Johnson, I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.\"\n[Johnson:] \"That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help.\"\nOn 6 August, Boswell departed England for Europe, with the initial goal of continuing his law studies at Utrecht University. He spent a year there and although desperately unhappy the first few months, eventually quite enjoyed his time in Utrecht. He mixed with prominent families, and pursued his studies industriously. Boswell admired the young widow Geelvinck who refused to marry him. He befriended and fell in love with Isabelle de Charri\u00e8re, also known as Belle van Zuylen, a vivacious young Dutchwoman of unorthodox opinions, his social and intellectual superior.\nOn 18 June 1764, Boswell set out from Utrecht by coach, and spent most of the next two years travelling around the continent, his Grand Tour. He travelled through Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Corsica and France. He arranged to meet European intellectuals Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire with a recommendation letter of Constant d'Hermenches, and made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his portrait was painted by George Willison. Boswell also travelled to Corsica and spent seven weeks there, meeting the Corsican resistance leader Pasquale Paoli, and sending reports to London newspapers. His diaries and correspondence of this time have been compiled into two books, \"Boswell in Holland\" and \"Boswell on the Grand Tour\".\nMature life.\nBoswell returned to London in February 1766 accompanied by Rousseau's mistress Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Levasseur, with whom he had a brief affair on the journey home. After spending a few weeks in the capital, he returned to Scotland, buying (or perhaps renting) the former house of David Hume on James Court on the Lawnmarket. He studied for his final law exam at Edinburgh University. He passed the exam and became an advocate. He practised the law in Edinburgh for over a decade, and most years spent his annual break in London, mingling with Johnson and many other London-based writers, editors, and printers, and furthering his literary ambitions. He contributed a great many items to newspapers and magazines, in London and Edinburgh. He found enjoyment in playing the intellectual rhyming game crambo with his peers.\nIn 1768 he published \"An account of Corsica, the journal of a tour to that island, and memoirs of Pascal Paoli.\" The book contained both a history and description of Corsica, as well as an account of his visit. Boswell was a major supporter of the Corsican Republic. Following the island's invasion by France in 1768, Boswell attempted to raise public awareness and rally support for the Corsicans. He sent arms and money to the Corsican fighters, who were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769. Boswell attended the masquerade held at the Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon in September 1769 dressed as a Corsican Chief. He was also, much to the chagrin of his friend Johnson, a strong defender of the American Revolution.\nSome of his journal entries and letters from this period describe his amatory exploits. Thus, in 1767, in a letter to William Johnson Temple, he wrote, \"I got myself quite intoxicated, went to a Bawdy-house and past a whole night in the arms of a Whore. She indeed was a fine strong spirited Girl, a Whore worthy of Boswell if Boswell must have a whore.\" A few years earlier, he wrote that during a night with an actress named Louisa, \"five times was I fairly lost in supreme rapture. Louisa was madly fond of me; she declared I was a prodigy and asked me if this was not extraordinary for human nature.\" Though he sometimes used a condom for protection, he contracted venereal disease at least seventeen times.\nBoswell married his cousin, Margaret Montgomerie, on 25 November 1769. She remained faithful to Boswell, despite his frequent liaisons with prostitutes, until her death from tuberculosis in 1789. After his infidelities, he would deliver tearful apologies to her and beg her forgiveness, before again promising her, and himself, that he would reform. James and Margaret had four sons and three daughters. Two sons died in infancy; the other two were Alexander (1775\u20131822) and James (1778\u20131822). Their daughters were Veronica (1773\u20131795), Euphemia (1774 \u2013 c. 1834) and Elizabeth, known as 'Betsy', (1780\u20131814). Boswell also had at least two extramarital children, Charles (1762\u20131764) and Sally (1767 \u2013 c. 1768).\nDespite his relative literary success with accounts of his European travels, Boswell was only a moderately successful advocate, with the exception of the copyright infringement case of \"Donaldson v Beckett\", where Boswell represented the Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson. By the late 1770s, Boswell descended further and further into alcoholism and gambling addiction. Throughout his life, from childhood until death, he was beset by severe swings of mood. His depressions frequently encouraged and were exacerbated by his various vices. His happier periods usually saw him relatively vice-free. His character mixed a superficial Enlightenment sensibility for reason and taste with a genuine and somewhat romantic love of the sublime and a propensity for occasionally puerile whimsy. The latter, along with his tendency for drink and other vices, caused many contemporaries and later observers to regard him as being too lightweight to be an equal in the literary crowd that he wanted to be a part of. However, his humour and innocent good nature won him many lifelong friends.\nIn 1773 Boswell bought the house of David Hume (who moved to a new house on South St David Street/St Andrew Square) on the south east corner of James Court. He lived there until 1786. Boswell's residency at James Court has been well established, but not the exact location. For example, a later edition of \"Traditions of Edinburgh\" by Robert Chambers suggests that Boswell's residence at James Court was actually in the Western wing. His James Court flat was notable for having two levels, and although a modern renovation in the Eastern section reveals such a possibility, it is likely that Boswell's residence was a similarly equipped one in the Western section that no longer exists, having burned down in the mid 1800s.\nEarl of Dumfries.\nBoswell became quite friendly with the 6th Earl of Dumfries. As well as seeing him in Scotland, he also visited him in Rosemount, London in 1787 and 1788.\nIn Boswell's journal of November 2, 1778, he writes, \"[The Earl of Dumfries] was exceedingly attentive to me [...] I was upon my guard, as I well knew that he and his Countess flattered themselves that they would get from me that road through our estate which my father had refused, and which in truth I was still more positive for refusing\". He saw the Earl as \"\u201cvery attentive\u201d\".\nHaving hosted the Earl, Boswell and his wife also decide to visit Dumfries House \"[o]ur visit was a little awkward, as there had been no communication between the families for several of the last years of my father's life [...] I, however, wished to live on civil terms with such near neighbours\".\nOn October 27, 1782, Boswell writes, \"we looked at Lord Dumfries's gate and the famous road. [...] I showed him that granting it would make the Auchinleck improvements appear part of the Earl of Dumfries's domains. [...] If Lord Eglinton \u2013 if my Earl \u2013 were Earl of Dumfries and living at Dumfries House, he should have the road, but not to him and his heirs.\"\nLater life.\nBoswell was a frequent guest of Lord Monboddo at Monboddo House, a setting where he gathered significant observations for his writings by association with Samuel Johnson, Lord Kames and other notable attendees.\nAfter Johnson's death in 1784, Boswell moved to London to try his luck at the English Bar, which proved even less successful than his career in Scotland. In 1792 Boswell lobbied the Home Secretary to help gain royal pardons for four Botany Bay escapees, including Mary Bryant. He also offered to stand for Parliament but failed to get the necessary support, and he spent the final years of his life writing his \"Life of Samuel Johnson\".\nDuring this time his health began to fail due to venereal disease and his years of drinking. Boswell died in London in 1795. Close to the end of his life he became strongly convinced that the \"Shakespeare papers\", including two previously unknown plays \"Vortigern and Rowena\" and \"Henry II\", allegedly discovered by William Henry Ireland, were genuine. After Boswell's death they proved to be forgeries created by Ireland himself. Boswell's remains were interred in the crypt of the Boswell family mausoleum in what is now the old Auchinleck Kirkyard in Ayrshire. The mausoleum is attached to the old Auchinleck kirk.\n\"Life of Samuel Johnson\".\nWhen the \"Life of Samuel Johnson\" was published in 1791, its style was unique in that, unlike other biographies of that era, it directly incorporated conversations that Boswell had noted down at the time for his journals. He also included more personal and human details than those to which contemporary readers were accustomed. Instead of writing a strictly fact-based record of Johnson's public life in the style of the time, he painted a more personal and intimate portrait of the man than was normal in biographies of the day.\nMacaulay and Carlyle, among others, have attempted to explain how a man such as Boswell could have produced a work as detailed as the \"Life of Johnson\". The former argued that Boswell's uninhibited folly and candour were his greatest qualifications; the latter replied that beneath such traits was a mind to discern excellence and a heart to appreciate it, aided by the power of accurate observation and considerable dramatic ability.\nPosition on slavery.\nBoswell was present at the meeting of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in May 1787 set up to persuade William Wilberforce to lead the abolition movement in Parliament. However, the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson records that by 1788 Boswell \"after having supported the cause ... became inimical to it\".\nBoswell's most prominent display of support for slavery was his 1791 poem \"No Abolition of Slavery; or the Universal Empire of Love\", which lampooned Clarkson, Wilberforce and Pitt. The poem also supports the common suggestion of the pro-slavery movement, that the slaves actually enjoyed their lot: \"The cheerful gang! \u2013 the negroes see / Perform the task of industry.\"\nDiscovery and publication of Boswell's private papers.\nIn the 1920s a great part of Boswell's private papers, including intimate journals for much of his life, were discovered at Malahide Castle, north of Dublin. These provide a hugely revealing insight into the life and thoughts of the man. They were sold to the American collector Ralph H. Isham and have since passed to Yale University, which has published popular and scholarly editions of his journals and correspondence, mostly edited by Frederick A. Pottle. A second cache was discovered soon after and also purchased by Isham. A substantially longer edition of \"The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides\" was published in 1936 based on his original manuscript, edited by L. F. Powell. His \"London Journal 1762\u201363\", the first of the Yale journal publications, appeared in 1950. The last popular edition, \"The Great Biographer, 1789\u20131795\", was published in 1989. Publication of the research edition of Boswell's journals and letters, each including never before published material, was ceased by Yale University in June 2021, prior to the completion of the project.\nThese detailed and frank journals include voluminous notes on the Grand Tour of Europe that he took as a young man and, subsequently, of his tour of Scotland with Johnson. His journals also record meetings and conversations with eminent individuals belonging to The Club, including Lord Monboddo, David Garrick, Edmund Burke, Joshua Reynolds and Oliver Goldsmith.\nIt is since the discovery of these journals that Boswell has become recognized as a major literary artist. In his openness to every nuance of feeling, his delicacy in capturing fugitive sentiments and revealing gestures, his comic self-regard and (at times) self-contempt, Boswell was willing to express what other authors of the time repressed.\nFreemasonry.\nBoswell was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning on 14 August 1759. He subsequently became Master of that Lodge in 1773 and in that year was Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. From 1776 to 1777 he was the Depute Grand Master of that Grand Lodge.\nIn fiction and popular culture.\nBoswell's surname has passed into the English language as a term (\"Boswell\", \"Boswellian\", \"Boswellism\") for a constant companion and observer, especially one who records those observations in print. In \"A Scandal in Bohemia\", Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character Sherlock Holmes affectionately says of Dr. Watson, who narrates the tales, \"I am lost without my Boswell.\"\nThe comedy \"Young Auchinleck\" (1962) by Scottish playwright Robert McLellan depicts Boswell's various courtships and troubled relations with his father in the period after his return to Scotland in 1766, culminating in his eventual marriage to his cousin Margaret Montgomery (Peggy) in 1769 on the same day as his father's second marriage in a different part of the country. The play was first produced at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1962 and adapted for BBC Television in 1965.\nIn 1981 the cartoonist R. Crumb published the piece \"Boswell's London Journal\" in the anthology magazine \"Weirdo\". Presented as a \"Klassic Komic,\" the piece featured meticulous cross-hatched illustrations and excerpts from Boswell's writing to tell a satirical story of the young Boswell attempting to establish himself in London society, dallying with prostitutes and suffering from venereal disease.\nBoswell was played by John Sessions in \"Boswell &amp; Johnson's Tour of the Western Isles\", a 1993 BBC 2 play.\nIn February and March 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast three episodes of \"Boswell's Lives\", writer Jon Canter's comedic take on Boswell meeting later historical figures (Sigmund Freud, Maria Callas and Harold Pinter, respectively) for the purposes of biographing them. Boswell was played by Miles Jupp.\nAmerican novelist Philip Baruth wrote a fictional account of James Boswell's early life in \"The Brothers Boswell\" (Soho Press 2009). The novel, which includes scenes that feature Samuel Johnson, is a thriller that focuses on the tense relationship between James and his younger brother John. Boswell also features as a character in James Robertson's novel, \"Joseph Knight\" (2003).\nPublished journals.\nAfter Boswell's private papers were recovered, and brought together by Ralph Isham, they were acquired by Yale University, where a dedicated office was established to edit and publish his journals and correspondence. The journals have been published in 13 volumes, as follows.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}
{"id": "62366", "revid": "50648682", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62366", "title": "Moa", "text": "Extinct order of birds\nMoa (order Dinornithiformes) are an extinct group of flightless birds formerly endemic to New Zealand. During the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, there were nine species (in six genera). The two largest species, \"Dinornis robustus\" and \"Dinornis novaezelandiae\", reached about in height with neck outstretched, and weighed about while the smallest, the bush moa (\"Anomalopteryx didiformis\"), was around the size of a turkey. Estimates of the moa population when Polynesians settled New Zealand circa 1300 vary between 58,000 and approximately 2.5 million.\nMoa are traditionally placed in the ratite group. Genetic studies have found that their closest relatives are the flighted South American tinamous, once considered a sister group to ratites. The nine species of moa were the only wingless birds, lacking even the vestigial wings that all other ratites have. They were the largest terrestrial animals and dominant herbivores in New Zealand's forest, shrubland, and subalpine ecosystems until the arrival of the M\u0101ori, and were hunted only by Haast's eagle. Moa extinction occurred within 100 years of human settlement of New Zealand, primarily due to overhunting.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"moa\" is a Polynesian term for domestic fowl. The name was not in common use among the M\u0101ori by the time of European contact, likely because the bird it described had been extinct for some time. Nevertheless, knowledge was passed down through traditional stories and proverbs, such as \"kua ngaro i te ngaro o te moa\" (lost as the moa is lost). The earliest written record of the name was by missionaries William Williams and William Colenso in January 1838; Colenso speculated that the birds may have resembled gigantic fowl. In 1912, M\u0101ori chief Urupeni P\u016bhara claimed that the moa's traditional name was \"te kura\" (the red bird). The North Island giant moa is also called \"kuranui\".\nDescription.\nMoa skeletons were traditionally reconstructed in an upright position to create impressive height, but analysis of their vertebral articulations indicates that they probably carried their heads forward, in the manner of a kiwi. The spine was attached to the rear of the head rather than the base, indicating the horizontal alignment. This would have let them graze on low vegetation, while being able to lift their heads and browse trees when necessary. This has resulted in a reconsideration of the height of larger moa. However, M\u0101ori rock art depicts moa or moa-like birds with necks upright, indicating that moa were capable of assuming both neck postures.\nNo records survive of what sounds moa made, though some idea of their calls can be gained from fossil evidence. The trachea of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings. These rings were preserved within some articulated skeletons, and shows that at least two moa genera (\"Euryapteryx\" and \"Emeus\") exhibited tracheal elongation, where their trachea, up to long, formed a large loop within the body cavity. They are the only ratites known to exhibit this feature, which is also present in several other bird groups, including swans, cranes, and guinea fowl. The feature is associated with deep resonant vocalisations that can travel long distances.\nFeathers and soft tissues.\nSeveral examples of moa remains have been found with soft tissues (muscle, skin, feathers) preserved through desiccation after the bird died at a dry site (for example, a cave with a constant dry breeze blowing through it); these specimens are a form of natural mummy. Most were found in the semiarid Central Otago region, the driest part of New Zealand, but others are known from outside the Central Otago region. These include:\nIn addition to these specimens, loose moa feathers have been collected from caves and rock shelters in the southern South Island, and based on these remains, some idea of the moa plumage has been achieved. The preserved leg of \"M. didinus\" from the Old Man Range reveals that this species was feathered right down to the foot. This is likely to have been an adaptation to living in high-altitude, snowy environments, and is also seen in the Darwin's rhea, which lives in a similar seasonally snowy habitat.\nMoa feathers are up to long, and a range of colours has been reported, including reddish-brown, white, yellowish, and purplish. Dark feathers with white or creamy tips have also been found, and indicate that some moa species may have had plumage with a speckled appearance.\nClassification.\nEvolutionary relationships.\nThe moa's closest relatives are small terrestrial South American birds called the tinamous, which can fly. Previously, the kiwi, the Australian emu, and cassowary were thought to be most closely related to the moa.\nAlthough dozens of species were described in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many were based on partial skeletons and turned out to be synonyms. Currently, 11 species are formally recognised, although recent studies using ancient DNA recovered from bones in museum collections suggest that distinct lineages exist within some of these. One factor that has caused much confusion in moa taxonomy is the intraspecific variation of bone sizes, between glacial and interglacial periods (see Bergmann's rule and Allen's rule), as well as sexual dimorphism being evident in several species. \"Dinornis\" seems to have had the most pronounced sexual dimorphism, with females being up to 150% as tall and 280% as heavy as males\u2014so much bigger that they were classified as separate species until 2003. A 2009 study showed that \"Euryapteryx curtus\" and \"E. gravis\" were synonyms. A 2010 study explained size differences among them as sexual dimorphism. A 2012 morphological study interpreted them as subspecies, instead.\nAnalyses of ancient DNA have determined that a number of cryptic evolutionary lineages occurred in several moa genera. These may eventually be classified as species or subspecies; \"Megalapteryx benhami\" (Archey) is synonymised with \"M.\u00a0didinus\" (Owen) because the bones of both share all essential characters. Size differences can be explained by a north\u2013south cline combined with temporal variation such that specimens were larger during the Otiran glacial period (the last ice age in New Zealand). Similar temporal size variation is known for the North Island's \"Pachyornis mappini\". Some of the other size variation for moa species can probably be explained by similar geographic and temporal factors.\nThe earliest moa remains come from the Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Known from multiple eggshells and hind limb elements, these represent at least two already fairly large-sized species.\nPhylogeny.\nBecause moa are a group of flightless birds with no vestiges of wing bones, questions have been raised about how they arrived in New Zealand, and from where. Many theories exist about the moa's arrival and radiation in New Zealand, but the most recent theory suggests that they arrived in New Zealand about 60\u00a0million years ago (Mya) and split from the \"basal\" (see below) moa species, \"Megalapteryx\", about 5.8\u00a0Mya instead of the 18.5\u00a0Mya split suggested by Baker et al. (2005). This does not necessarily mean there was no speciation between the arrival 60\u00a0Mya and the basal split 5.8\u00a0Mya, but the fossil record is lacking and most likely the early moa lineages existed, but became extinct before the basal split 5.8\u00a0Mya. The presence of Miocene-aged species certainly suggests that moa diversification began before the split between \"Megalapteryx\" and the other taxa.\nThe Oligocene Drowning Maximum event, which occurred about 22\u00a0Mya, when only 18% of present-day New Zealand was above sea level, is very important in the moa radiation. Because the basal moa split occurred so recently (5.8\u00a0Mya), it was argued that ancestors of the Quaternary moa lineages could not have been present on both the South and North Island remnants during the Oligocene drowning. This does not imply that moa were previously absent from the North Island, but that only those from the South Island survived, because only the South Island was above sea level. Bunce et al. (2009) argued that moa ancestors survived on the South Island and then recolonised the North Island about 2\u00a0Myr later, when the two islands rejoined after 30\u00a0Myr of separation. The presence of Miocene moa in the Saint Bathans fauna seems to suggest that these birds increased in size soon after the Oligocene drowning event, if they were affected by it at all.\nBunce et al. also concluded that the highly complex structure of the moa lineage was caused by the formation of the Southern Alps about 6\u00a0Mya, and the habitat fragmentation on both islands resulting from Pleistocene glacial cycles, volcanism, and landscape changes. The cladogram below is a phylogeny of Palaeognathae generated by Mitchell (2014) with some clade names after Yuri \"et al.\" (2013). It provides the position of the moa (Dinornithiformes) within the larger context of the \"ancient jawed\" (Palaeognathae) birds:\nThe cladogram below gives a more detailed, species-level phylogeny, of the moa branch (Dinornithiformes) of the \"ancient jawed\" birds (Palaeognathae) shown above:\nTaxonomy.\nThe currently recognised genera and species are:\nTwo unnamed species are also known from the Saint Bathans Fauna.\nDistribution and habitat.\nAnalyses of fossil moa bone assemblages have provided detailed data on the habitat preferences of individual moa species, and revealed distinctive regional moa faunas:\nSouth Island.\nThe two main faunas identified in the South Island include:\n The fauna of the high-rainfall west coast beech (\"Nothofagus\") forests that included \"Anomalopteryx didiformis\" (bush moa) and \"Dinornis robustus\" (South Island giant moa), and\n The fauna of the dry rainshadow forest and shrublands east of the Southern Alps that included \"Pachyornis elephantopus\" (heavy-footed moa), \"Euryapteryx curtus\", \"Emeus crassus\", and \"Dinornis robustus\".\nA 'subalpine fauna' might include the widespread \"D. robustus\", and the two other moa species that existed in the South Island:\n \"Pachyornis australis\", the rarest moa species, the only moa species not yet found in M\u0101ori middens. Its bones have been found in caves in the northwest Nelson and Karamea districts (such as Honeycomb Hill Cave), and some sites around the W\u0101naka district.\n \"Megalapteryx didinus\", more widespread, named \"upland moa\" because its bones are commonly found in the subalpine zone. However, it also occurred down to sea level, where suitable steep and rocky terrain (such as Punakaiki on the west coast and Central Otago) existed. Their distributions in coastal areas have been rather unclear, but were present at least in several locations such as on Kaik\u014dura, Otago Peninsula, and Karitane.\nNorth Island.\nSignificantly less is known about North Island paleofaunas, due to the scarcity of fossil sites compared to the South Island, but the basic pattern of moa-habitat relationships was the same. The South Island and the North Island shared some moa species (\"Euryapteryx curtus\", \"Anomalopteryx didiformis\"), but most were exclusive to one island, reflecting divergence over several thousand years since lower sea level in the Ice Age had made a land bridge across the Cook Strait.\nIn the North Island, \"Dinornis novaezealandiae\" and \"Anomalopteryx didiformis\" dominated in high-rainfall forest habitat, a similar pattern to the South Island. The other moa species present in the North Island (\"Euryapteryx\" \"curtus\" and \"Pachyornis geranoides\") tended to inhabit drier forest and shrubland habitats. \"P. geranoides\" occurred throughout the North Island.\nBehaviour and ecology.\nAbout eight moa trackways, with fossilised moa footprint impressions in fluvial silts, have been found in the North Island, including Waikanae Creek (1872), Napier (1887), Manawat\u016b River (1895), Marton (1896), Palmerston North (1911) (see photograph to left), Rangit\u012bkei River (1939), and under water in Lake Taup\u014d (1973). Analysis of the spacing of these tracks indicates walking speeds between . In 2022, an additional trackway was discovered at the entrance of Kaipara Harbour.\nIn 2019, the first known trackway in the South Island was found in a riverbed at Kyeburn, Otago. A second set of footprints were discovered at Pareora, Canterbury, in 2022.\nStudies of accumulated dried vegetation in the pre-human mid-late Holocene period suggests a low \"Sophora microphylla\" or K\u014dwai forest ecosystem in Central Otago that was used by \u2014 and perhaps maintained by \u2014 moa for both nesting material and food. By the 1850s, when European settlers came to the area, neither the forests nor moa were present, vanishing prior to settlement by colonists.\nDiet.\nTheir diet has been deduced from fossilised contents of their gizzards and coprolites, as well as indirectly through morphological analysis of skull and beak, and stable isotope analysis of their bones. Moa fed on a range of plant species and plant parts, including fibrous twigs and leaves taken from low trees and shrubs. The beak of \"Pachyornis elephantopus\" was analogous to a pair of secateurs, and could clip the fibrous leaves of New Zealand flax (\"Phormium tenax\") and twigs up to at least 8\u00a0mm in diameter.\nMoa filled the ecological niche occupied in other countries by large browsing mammals such as antelope and llamas. Some biologists contend that a number of plant species evolved to avoid moa browsing. Divaricating plants such as \"Pennantia corymbosa\" (the kaik\u014dmako), which have small leaves and a dense mesh of branches, and \"Pseudopanax crassifolius\" (the horoeka or lancewood), which has tough juvenile leaves, are possible examples of plants that evolved in such a way. Likewise, it has been suggested that heteroblasty might be a response to moa browsing.\nLike many other birds, moa swallowed gizzard stones (gastroliths), which were retained in their muscular gizzards, providing a grinding action that allowed them to eat coarse plant material. This grinding action suggests that moa were not effective seed dispersers, with only the smallest seeds passing through their gut intact. These stones were commonly smooth rounded quartz pebbles, but stones over long have been found among preserved moa gizzard contents. \"Dinornis\" gizzards could often contain several kilograms of stones. Moa likely exercised a certain selectivity in the choice of gizzard stones and chose the hardest pebbles.\nReproduction.\nThe pairs of species of moa described as \"Euryapteryx curtus\" / \"E.\u00a0exilis\", \"Emeus huttonii\" / \"E.\u00a0crassus\", and \"Pachyornis septentrionalis\" / \"P.\u00a0mappini\" have long been suggested to constitute males and females, respectively. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material.\nFor example, before 2003, three species of \"Dinornis\" were recognised: South Island giant moa (\"D.\u00a0robustus\"), North Island giant moa (\"D.\u00a0novaezealandiae\"), and slender moa (\"D.\u00a0struthioides\"). However, DNA showed that all \"D.\u00a0struthioides\" were males, and all \"D.\u00a0robustus\" were females. Therefore, the three species of \"Dinornis\" were reclassified as two species, one each formerly occurring on New Zealand's North Island (\"D.\u00a0novaezealandiae\") and South Island (\"D.\u00a0robustus\"); \"D.\u00a0robustus\" however, comprises three distinct genetic lineages and may eventually be classified as many species, as discussed above.\nExamination of growth rings in moa cortical bone has revealed that these birds were K-selected, as are many other large endemic New Zealand birds. They are characterised by having a low fecundity and a long maturation period, taking about 10 years to reach adult size. The large \"Dinornis\" species took as long to reach adult size as small moa species, and as a result, had fast skeletal growth during their juvenile years.\nNo evidence has been found to suggest that moa were colonial nesters. Moa nesting is often inferred from accumulations of eggshell fragments in caves and rock shelters, little evidence exists of the nests themselves. Excavations of rock shelters in the eastern North Island during the 1940s found moa nests, which were described as \"small depressions obviously scratched out in the soft dry pumice\". Moa nesting material has also been recovered from rock shelters in the Central Otago region of the South Island, where the dry climate has preserved plant material used to build the nesting platform (including twigs clipped by moa bills). Seeds and pollen within moa coprolites found among the nesting material provide evidence that the nesting season was late spring to summer.\nFragments of moa eggshell are often found in archaeological sites and sand dunes around the New Zealand coast. Thirty-six whole moa eggs exist in museum collections and vary greatly in size (from in length and wide). The outer surface of moa eggshell is characterised by small, slit-shaped pores. The eggs of most moa species were white, although those of the upland moa (\"Megalapteryx didinus\") were blue-green.\nA 2010 study by Huynen et al. found that the eggs of certain species were fragile, only around a millimetre in shell thickness: \"Unexpectedly, several thin-shelled eggs were also shown to belong to the heaviest moa of the genera \"Dinornis\", \"Euryapteryx\", and \"Emeus\", making these, to our knowledge, the most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date. Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of \"Dinornis\" and \"Euryapteryx\" suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical contact method of avian egg incubation was used.\" Despite the bird's extinction, the high yield of DNA available from recovered fossilised eggs has allowed the moa's genome to be sequenced.\nRelationship with humans.\nDiscovery.\nBefore the arrival of humans, the moa's only predator was the massive Haast's eagle. New Zealand had been isolated for 80 million years and had few predators before human arrival, meaning that not only were its ecosystems extremely vulnerable to perturbation by outside species, but also the native species were ill-equipped to cope with human predators. Polynesians arrived sometime before 1300, and all moa genera were soon driven to extinction by hunting and, to a lesser extent, by habitat reduction due to forest clearance. By 1445, all moa had become extinct, along with Haast's eagle, which had relied on them for food. Recent research using carbon-14 dating of middens strongly suggests that the events leading to extinction took less than a hundred years, rather than a period of exploitation lasting several hundred years as previously hypothesised.\nAn expedition in the 1850s under Lieutenant A. Impey reported two emu-like birds on a hillside in the South Island; an 1861 story from the \"Nelson Examiner\" told of three-toed footprints measuring between T\u0101kaka and Riwaka that were found by a surveying party; and finally in 1878, the \"Otago Witness\" published an additional account from a farmer and his shepherd. An 86-year-old woman, Alice McKenzie, claimed in 1959 that she had seen a moa in Fiordland bush in 1887, and again on a Fiordland beach when she was 17 years old. She claimed that her brother had also seen a moa on another occasion. In childhood, Mackenzie saw a large bird that she believed to be a takah\u0113, but after its rediscovery in the 1940s, she saw a picture of it and concluded that she had seen something else.\nSome authors have speculated that a few \"Megalapteryx didinus\" may have persisted in remote corners of New Zealand until the 18th and even 19th centuries, but this view is not widely accepted. Some M\u0101ori hunters claimed to be in pursuit of the moa as late as the 1770s; however, these accounts possibly did not refer to the hunting of actual birds as much as a now-lost ritual among South Islanders. Whalers and sealers recalled seeing monstrous birds along the coast of the South Island, and in the 1820s, a man named George Pauley made an unverified claim of seeing a moa in the Otago region of New Zealand. Occasional speculation since at least the late 19th century, and as recently as 2008, has suggested that some moa may still exist, particularly in the wilderness of South Westland and Fiordland. A 1993 report initially interested the Department of Conservation, but the animal in a blurry photograph was identified as a red deer. Cryptozoologists continue to search for them, but their claims and supporting evidence (such as of purported footprints) have earned little attention from experts and are pseudoscientific.\nThe rediscovery of the takah\u0113 in 1948 after none had been seen since 1898 showed that rare birds can exist undiscovered for a long time. However, the takah\u0113 is a much smaller bird than the moa, and was rediscovered after its tracks were identified\u2014yet no reliable evidence of moa tracks has ever been found, and experts still contend that moa survival is extremely unlikely, since they would have to be living unnoticed for over 500 years in a region visited often by hunters and hikers.\nResearch history.\nJoel Polack, a trader who lived on the East Coast of the North Island from 1834 to 1837, recorded in 1838 that he had been shown \"several large fossil ossifications\" found near Mt\u00a0Hikurangi. He was certain that these were the bones of a species of emu or ostrich, noting that \"the Natives add that in times long past they received the traditions that very large birds had existed, but the scarcity of animal food, as well as the easy method of entrapping them, has caused their extermination\". Polack further noted that he had received reports from M\u0101ori that a \"species of Struthio\" still existed in remote parts of the South Island.\nDieffenbach also refers to a fossil from the area near Mt Hikurangi, and surmises that it belongs to \"a bird, now extinct, called Moa (or Movie) by the natives\". 'Movie' is the first transcribed name for the bird. In 1839, John W. Harris, a Poverty Bay flax trader who was a natural-history enthusiast, was given a piece of unusual bone by a M\u0101ori who had found it in a river bank. He showed the fragment of bone to his uncle, John Rule, a Sydney surgeon, who sent it to Richard Owen, who at that time was working at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.\nOwen puzzled over the fragment for almost four years. He established it was part of the femur of a big animal, but it was uncharacteristically light and honeycombed. Owen announced to a skeptical scientific community and the world that it was from a giant extinct bird like an ostrich, and named it \"Dinornis\". His deduction was ridiculed in some quarters, but was proved correct with the subsequent discoveries of considerable quantities of moa bones throughout the country, sufficient to reconstruct skeletons of the birds. In July 2004, the Natural History Museum in London placed on display the moa bone fragment Owen had first examined, to celebrate 200 years since his birth, and in memory of Owen as founder of the museum. Since the discovery of the first moa bones in the late 1830s, thousands more have been found. They occur in a range of late Quaternary and Holocene sedimentary deposits, but are most common in three main types of site: caves, dunes, and swamps.\nBones are commonly found in caves or \"tomo\" (the M\u0101ori word for doline or sinkhole, often used to refer to pitfalls or vertical cave shafts). The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave and birds that fell into a vertical shaft and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the limestone/marble areas of northwest Nelson, Karamea, Waitomo, and Te Anau.\nMoa bones and eggshell fragments sometimes occur in active coastal sand dunes, where they may erode from paleosols and concentrate in 'blowouts' between dune ridges. Many such moa bones antedate human settlement, although some originate from M\u0101ori midden sites, which frequently occur in dunes near harbours and river mouths (for example the large moa hunter sites at Shag River, Otago, and Wairau Bar, Marlborough).\nDensely intermingled moa bones have been encountered in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at Pyramid Valley in north Canterbury, where bones from at least 183 individual moa have been excavated, mostly by Roger Duff of Canterbury Museum. Many explanations have been proposed to account for how these deposits formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires. However, the currently accepted explanation is that the bones accumulated slowly over thousands of years, from birds that entered the swamps to feed and became trapped in the soft sediment.\nMany New Zealand and international museums hold moa bone collections. Auckland War Memorial Museum \u2013 T\u0101maki Paenga Hira has a significant collection, and in 2018 several moa skeletons were imaged and 3D scanned to make the collections more accessible. There is also a major collection in Otago Museum in Dunedin.\nIn literature and culture.\nHeinrich Harder portrayed moa being hunted by M\u0101ori in the classic German collecting cards about extinct and prehistoric animals, \"Tiere der Urwelt\", in the early 1900s.\nThe moa was the most commonly used animal as a symbol of New Zealand before it was replaced by the kiwi in the early 20th century.\nAllen Curnow's poem, \"The Skeleton of the Great Moa in the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch\" was published in 1943.\nPotential revival.\nThe creature has frequently been mentioned as a potential candidate for revival by cloning. Its iconic status, coupled with the facts that it only became extinct a few hundred years ago and that substantial quantities of moa remains exist, mean that it is often listed alongside such creatures as the dodo as leading candidates for de-extinction. Preliminary work involving the extraction of DNA has been undertaken by Japanese geneticist Ankoh Yasuyuki Shirota.\nInterest in the moa's potential for revival was further stirred in mid-2014 when New Zealand Member of Parliament Trevor Mallard suggested that bringing back some smaller species of moa within 50 years was a viable idea. The idea was ridiculed by many, but gained support from some natural history experts.\nIn July 2025, American biotechnology Colossal Biosciences announced early phases of plans to \"revive\" the South Island giant moa by adding moa genes to a related species in collaboration with the Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre with funding from Peter Jackson.\nSee also.\nGeneral:\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62368", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62368", "title": "Eddie Slovik", "text": "American soldier (1920\u20131945)\nEdward Donald Slovik (February 18, 1920\u00a0\u2013 January 31, 1945) was an American soldier who was court-martialed and executed for desertion during World War II. He was the only US serviceman to have met such a fate since the American Civil War, though in 1902, during the American-Philippine War, two American soldiers (Edmund DuBose and Lewis Russell) of the 9th Cavalry Regiment were executed for \"desertion to the enemy\". Although over 21,000 American servicemen were given varying sentences for desertion during World War II, including 49 death sentences, Slovik's death sentence was the only one that was carried out. The case was brought to public attention by the 1954 book \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" by William Bradford Huie, later made into an NBC 1974 television movie.\nEarly life and education.\nSlovik was born in Detroit, Michigan, in 1920 to a Catholic, Polish-American family, the son of Anna Lutsky and Josef Slowikowski. While a minor, he was a troublemaker and had contact with the police frequently. Slovik was first arrested at age 12 when he and some friends broke into a foundry to steal brass. From 1932 to 1937, he was arrested several times for offenses which included petty theft, breaking and entering, and disturbing the peace. In October 1937, he was sent to prison, but was paroled in September 1938. After stealing and crashing a car with two friends while drunk, he was sent back to prison in January 1939.\nCareer.\nIn April 1942, Slovik was paroled once more. He then obtained a job at Montella Plumbing and Heating in Dearborn, Michigan. While working there, he met the woman who became his wife, Antoinette Wisniewski. She was working as a bookkeeper for Montella Plumbing's owner, James Montella. They married on November 7, 1942, and lived with her parents. Slovik's criminal record classified him as morally unfit for duty in the U.S. military (4-F), but, shortly after the couple's first wedding anniversary, Slovik was reclassified as fit for duty (1-A) and subsequently drafted by the Army on January 3, 1944, from Detroit, Michigan.\nSlovik arrived at Camp Wolters, Texas, for basic training on January 24, 1944, and was assigned to Company D of the 59th Infantry Training Battalion on January 31, 1944. On July 11, 1944, he was assigned to Ground Forces Replacement Depot No. 1 at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. In August, he was dispatched to join the fighting in German-occupied France, and was assigned to the 3rd Replacement Depot. On August 24, he was one of 129 replacements assigned to the 28th Infantry Division. He stayed in the division rear area overnight, before being assigned along with fifteen other men to Company G, 109th Infantry Regiment on August 25, 1944.\nDesertion.\nWhile en route to his assigned unit near Elbeuf, France, Slovik and Private John Tankey, a friend he met at Fort Meade, took cover during an artillery attack during the night and became separated from Company G. Company G moved on the next morning, inadvertently leaving Slovik and Tankey behind. Slovik and Tankey found a Canadian military police unit that had occupied the town and remained with it for the next six weeks. Tankey wrote to his and Slovik's regiment to explain their absence before the Canadians made arrangements for them to return to duty with their unit on October 7, 1944.\nThe following day, October 8, Slovik informed his company commander, Captain Ralph Grotte, that he was \"too scared\" to serve in a front-line rifle company and asked to be reassigned to a unit in a rear area. He then told Grotte that he would run away if he were assigned to a rifle unit, and asked his captain if that would constitute desertion, resulting in a court-martial. Grotte confirmed that it would, refused Slovik's request for reassignment, and sent him to a rifle platoon.\nThe next day, October 9, Slovik deserted from his unit. John Tankey caught up with him and attempted to persuade him to stay, but Slovik's only comment was that his \"mind was made up\". Slovik walked several miles to the rear and approached an enlisted cook at a military government detachment of the 112th Infantry Regiment, presenting him with a note which stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I, Pvt. Eddie D. Slovik, 36896415, confess to the desertion of the United States Army. At the time of my desertion we were in Albuff [\"sic\"; \"Elbeuf\"] in France. I came to Albuff as a replacement. They were shilling [\"sic\"; \"shelling\"] the town and we were told to dig in for the night. The following morning they were shilling us again. I was so scared[,] nerves [\"sic\"; \"nervous\"] and trembling that at the time the other replacements moved out I couldn't move. I stayed their [\"sic\"; \"there\"] in my fox hole till it was quite [\"sic\"; \"quiet\"] and I was able to move. I then walked into town. Not seeing any of our troops so I stayed over night at a French hospital. The next morning I turned myself over to the Canadian Provost Corp [\"sic\"; \"Corps\"]. After being with them six weeks I was turned over to American M.R[.] [\"sic\"; \"MP\" - \"military police\"] They turned me lose [\"sic\"; loose]. I told my commanding officer my story. I said that if I had to go out their [\"sic\"; there] again Id [\"sic\"; \"I'd\"] run away. He said there was nothing he could do for me so I ran away again AND I'LL RUN AWAY AGAIN IF I HAVE TO GO OUT THEIR [\"sic\"; \"THERE\"].\u2014\u200a\nThe cook took Slovik to a military policeman, then to his company commander, who read the note and urged Slovik to destroy it before he was taken into custody. Slovik refused. He was brought before Lieutenant Colonel Ross Henbest, who again offered him the opportunity to tear up the note, return to his unit, and face no further charges; Slovik again refused. Henbest instructed Slovik to write another note on the back of the first one stating that he fully understood the consequences of deliberately incriminating himself, and that it would be used as evidence against him in a court-martial.\nSlovik was taken into custody and confined to the division stockade. The division's judge advocate, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Sommer, offered Slovik a third and final opportunity to rejoin his unit in exchange for the charges against him being dropped. He also offered to transfer Slovik to a different infantry regiment in the division where no one would know of his past and he could start with a \"clean slate\". Slovik, still convinced that he would face only jail time (which he had already experienced and considered far more tolerable than combat), declined these offers, saying \"I've made up my mind. I'll take my court martial.\"\nCourt-martial.\nThe 28th Infantry Division was scheduled to begin an attack in the H\u00fcrtgen Forest. The coming attack was common knowledge in the unit, and casualty rates were expected to be high, as the prolonged combat in the area had been unusually grueling. The Germans were determined to hold the terrain, and weather greatly reduced the usual American advantages in armor and air support. A small minority of soldiers (less than 0.5%) indicated they preferred to be imprisoned rather than remain in combat, and the rates of desertion and other crimes had begun to rise.\nSlovik was charged with desertion to avoid hazardous duty and tried by court-martial on November 11, 1944. Slovik had to be tried by a court-martial composed of staff officers from other U.S. Army divisions, because all combat officers from the 28th Infantry Division were fighting on the front lines. The prosecutor, Captain John Green, presented witnesses to whom Slovik had stated his intention to \"run away\". According to his defense counsel, Captain Edward Woods, Slovik had elected not to testify. Woods had mitigating evidence that could have spared Slovik's life: he served with the Canadians for six weeks and willingly took a rear-echelon job. However, Slovik declined to present it even after being advised of his right to do so by both Woods and the court. In a case similar to Slovik, another soldier had been sentenced to death and nearly executed. However, at the last moment, Eisenhower commuted the sentence of this soldier to a prison term since he had presented marginal mitigating evidence.\nAt the end of the day, the nine officers of the court found Slovik guilty and sentenced him to death. The sentence was reviewed and approved by Major General Norman Cota, the division commander. General Cota's stated attitude was \"Given the situation as I knew it in November 1944, I thought it was my duty to this country to approve that sentence. If I hadn't approved it \u2013 if I had let Slovik accomplish his purpose \u2013 I don't know how I could have gone up to the line and looked a good soldier in the face.\"\nOn December 9, Slovik wrote a letter to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, pleading for clemency. However, desertion was becoming a systemic problem in France. A surprise German offensive through the Ardennes began on December 16 with severe US casualties. The Battle of the Bulge would last over a month, straining the morale of the infantry to the greatest extent yet seen during the war.\nThe case was reviewed by assistant staff judge advocate Maj. Frederick J. Bertolet, who recommended against granting clemency. Bertolet wrote: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBrigadier General E. C. McNeil, the senior Army lawyer in the European Theater, and lawyers on McNeil\u2019s staff, reviewed Slovik\u2019s case. McNeil wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This is the first death sentence which has reached me for examination. It is probably the first of the kind in the American army for over eighty years \u2013 there were none in WWI. In this case the extreme penalty of death appears warranted. This soldier had performed no front line duty. He did not intend to. He deserted from his group of fifteen when about to join the infantry company to which he had been assigned. His subsequent conduct shows a deliberate plan to secure trial and incarceration in a safe place. The sentence adjudged was more severe than he had anticipated, but the imposition of a less severe sentence would only have accomplished the accused's purpose of securing his incarceration and consequent freedom from the dangers which so many of our armed forces are required to face daily. His unfavorable civilian record indicates that he is not a worthy subject of clemency.\nLt. Col. Henry J. Sommer, the division judge advocate who had previously offered Slovik a final opportunity to have his charges dismissed, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEisenhower confirmed the execution order on December 23, noting that it was necessary to discourage further desertions. The sentence came as a shock to Slovik, who had been expecting a dishonorable discharge and a prison term, the same punishment he had seen given to other deserters from the division while he was confined to the stockade. As he was an ex-convict, a dishonorable discharge would have made little impact on his civilian life as a common laborer, and military prison terms for discipline offenses were widely expected to be commuted once the war was over.\nExecution.\nThe execution by firing squad was carried out at 10:04\u00a0a.m. on January 31, 1945, near the village of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The defiant Slovik said to the soldiers whose duty it was to prepare him for the firing squad before they led him to the place of execution:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They're not shooting me for deserting the United States Army, thousands of guys have done that. They just need to make an example out of somebody and I'm it because I'm an ex-con. I used to steal things when I was a kid, and that's what they are shooting me for. They're shooting me for the bread and chewing gum I stole when I was 12 years old.\nAs required by military custom, Slovik's uniform was stripped of all identifying military insignia, buttons, and any other accoutrements. He was wrapped with a GI blanket over his shoulders to protect him against the cold, and led into the courtyard of a house chosen for the execution because of its high masonry wall, which would deflect errant bullets and discourage the local French civilians from witnessing the proceedings. Soldiers stood him against a post. He was then strapped to the post with web belts, with one wrapped around and under his arms and hung on a spike on the back side of the post to prevent his body from slumping following the volley, and the others securing his waist and knees. Just before a soldier placed a black hood over his head, the attending chaplain, Father Carl Patrick Cummings, said to Slovik, \"Eddie, when you get up there, say a little prayer for me.\" Slovik replied with his last words: \"Okay, Father. I'll pray that you don't follow me too soon.\"\nThe firing squad consisted of 12 soldiers selected from the 109th Regiment. The weapons used were standard-issue M1 Garand rifles, 11 of them loaded with just one round and one rifle loaded with a blank round. On the command of \"Fire\", Slovik was hit by eleven bullets, at least four of them being fatal. The wounds ranged from high in the neck region out to the left shoulder, over the left chest, and under the heart. One bullet was in the left upper arm. An Army physician quickly determined Slovik had not been immediately killed. As the firing squad's rifles were being reloaded to fire another volley, Slovik died. He was 24 years old. The entire execution took 15 minutes.\nBurial.\nSlovik was buried in Plot E of Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial in F\u00e8re-en-Tardenois, alongside 95 American soldiers executed for rape or murder. Their grave markers are hidden from view by shrubbery and bear sequential numbers instead of names, making it impossible to identify them individually without knowing the key. Antoinette Slovik petitioned the Army for her husband's remains and his pension until her death in 1979.\nSlovik's case was taken in 1981 by former Macomb County Commissioner Bernard V. Calka, a Polish-American and veteran of World War II, who continued to petition the Army to return Slovik's remains to the United States. In 1987, he persuaded President Ronald Reagan to order their return. In 1987, Calka raised $5,000 to pay for the exhumation of Slovik's remains from Row 3, Grave 65 of Plot E, and their transfer to Detroit's Woodmere Cemetery, where Slovik was reburied next to his wife. Slovik's military service record is archived and publicly available from the Military Personnel Records Center.\nAntoinette Slovik and others petitioned seven U.S. presidents (Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter) for a pardon, but none was granted.\nAnalysis.\nDuring World War II, 1.7 million courts-martial were held, representing one third of all criminal cases tried in the United States during the same period. Most of the cases were minor, as were the sentences. Nevertheless, a clemency board, appointed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in the summer of 1945, reviewed all general courts-martial where the accused was still in confinement, and remitted or reduced the sentence in 85 percent of the 27,000 serious cases reviewed. The death penalty was rarely imposed, and usually only for cases involving rape or murder. Slovik was the only soldier executed who had been convicted of a \"purely military\" offense.\nIn militaries around the world, courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny. In France during World War I, from 1917 to 1918, the United States Army executed 35 of its own soldiers, but all were convicted of rape or unprovoked murder of civilians and not for military offenses. During World War II, in all theaters of the war, the United States military executed 102 of its own soldiers for rape and/or murder of fellow soldiers and civilians, but only Slovik was executed for the military offense of desertion.\nColonel Robert C. Bard of the judge advocate general's office noted that of the 2,864 army personnel tried for desertion for the period January 1942 through June 1948, 49 were convicted and sentenced to death, with 48 of those sentences commuted by higher authority. At least one of the members of the tribunal came to believe that Slovik's execution was an injustice in light of all the circumstances, and was an example of disparate treatment from a flawed process.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1954, William Bradford Huie published a non-fiction account of the case titled \"The Execution of Private Slovik\".\nIn 1960, Frank Sinatra announced his plan to produce a movie based on the book, with the same title, to be written by screenwriter Albert Maltz. This announcement provoked great outrage, in part because Maltz was part of the blacklisted Hollywood 10, and Sinatra was accused of being a Communist sympathizer. As Sinatra was campaigning for John F. Kennedy for president at the time, the Kennedy camp became concerned, and persuaded Sinatra to cancel the project.\nHans Magnus Enzensberger wrote an essay about Slovik and his death, included in the 1964 book \"Dreamers of the Absolute\" ().\nIn 1968, psychedelic folk rock group Pearls Before Swine dedicated their second album \"Balaklava\" \"to Pvt. Edward D. Slovik, U.S. Army, deceased\".\nIn 1974, Huie's book was adapted by Lamont Johnson into a TV movie, also titled \"The Execution of Private Slovik\", which starred Martin Sheen.\nThe 1963 war film \"The Victors\" includes a scene featuring the execution of a deserter that closely resembles Slovik's desertion and execution.\nKurt Vonnegut mentions Slovik's execution in his 1969 novel \"Slaughterhouse-Five\". Vonnegut also wrote a companion (alternate) libretto to Igor Stravinsky's \"L'Histoire du soldat\" (\"A Soldier's Tale\"), telling Slovik's story.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Preakness Stakes is a Grade I race run over a distance of on dirt. Colts and geldings carry ; fillies . It is the second jewel (or leg) of the Triple Crown, held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes.\nFirst run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland governor after the colt who won the first Dinner Party Stakes at Pimlico. Annual \"Preakness Weekend\" races include both the Saturday Preakness Stakes and a Grade II race on Friday for fillies only named the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America among equestrian events, surpassed only by the Kentucky Derby.\nThe 150th running of the Preakness Stakes was held on Saturday, May 17, 2025.\nHistory.\nTwo years before the Kentucky Derby was run for the first time, Pimlico introduced its new stakes race for three-year-olds, the Preakness, during its first spring race meet in 1873. Then Maryland governor Oden Bowie named the then mile and one-half (2.41\u00a0km) race in honor of the colt Preakness from Milton Holbrook Sanford's Preakness Stud in Preakness, Wayne Township, New Jersey, who won the Dinner Party Stakes on the day Pimlico opened (October 25, 1870). The New Jersey name was said to have come from the Native American name \"Pra-qua-les\" (\"Quail Woods\") for the area. After Preakness won the Dinner Party Stakes, his jockey, Billy Hayward, untied a silk bag of gold coins that hung from a wire stretched across the track from the judges' stand. This was the supposed way that the \"wire\" at the finish line was introduced and how the awarding of \"purse\" money came to be. In reality, the term \"purse\", meaning prize money, had been in use for well over a century.\nThe first Preakness, held on May 27, 1873, drew seven starters. John Chamberlain's three-year-old, Survivor, collected the $2,050 winning purse by galloping home easily by 10 lengths. This was the largest margin of victory until 2004, when Smarty Jones won by 11 1/2 lengths.\nIn 1890, Morris Park Racecourse in The Bronx, New York, hosted the Preakness Stakes. This race was run under handicap conditions, and the age restriction was lifted. The race was won by a five-year-old horse named Montague. After 1890, there was no race run for three years. For the 15 years from 1894 through 1908, the race was held at Gravesend Race Track on Coney Island, New York. In 1909 it returned to Pimlico.\nSeven editions of the Preakness Stakes have been run under handicap conditions, in which more accomplished or favored horses are assigned to carry heavier weight. It was first run under these conditions in 1890 and again in the years 1910\u20131915. During these years, the race was known as the Preakness Handicap.\nIn March 2009 Magna Entertainment Corp., which owns Pimlico, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy thus throwing open the possibility the Stakes could move again. On April 13, 2009, the Maryland Legislature approved a plan to buy the Stakes and the Pimlico course if Magna Entertainment could not find a buyer.\nAttendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes, the Breeders' Cup and the Kentucky Oaks. The attendance of the Preakness Stakes typically only trails the Kentucky Derby, for more information see American thoroughbred racing top attended events.\nIn February 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority released the first phase of a study saying that Pimlico needed $250 million in renovations. As of May of that year, no one showed interest in financing the work. The Stronach Group, owner of Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park, was only interested in moving the Preakness Stakes to Laurel Park unless someone else financed work on Pimlico.\nIn October 2019, The Stronach Group reached an agreement in principle with the city of Baltimore and groups representing Maryland horsemen that would permanently keep the Preakness at Pimlico. As part of the agreement, Pimlico's grandstand would be demolished and replaced with a smaller structure, and temporary seating would be added to handle the attendance during Preakness week. \nThe Racing and Community Development Act, approved by the Maryland state legislature in May 2020, allows the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue $375 million in bonds for the renovation of both Stronach Group tracks.\nThe 145th running of the Preakness Stakes was held on Saturday, October 3, 2020, a delay resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak earlier in the year, and setting the year's contest four weeks after the also-delayed Kentucky Derby. It was held without spectators for health reasons because of the outbreak.\nIn April 2024, the Maryland General Assembly approved a bill that would consolidate Maryland thoroughbred racing at Pimlico and provide for the reconstruction of the Pimlico facility. As part of the initiative, a state board approved a $14.3 million contract to begin demolishing and redeveloping the outdated Pimlico Race Course. As a result of the planned reconstruction of the Pimlico grandstand, the Preakness Stakes will be temporarily relocated to Laurel Park in 2026, with a return to Pimlico scheduled for 2027.\nIn January 2025 management of thoroughbred racing in Maryland changed from the Stronach Group to the newly-formed, state-owned Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority (MTROA). The Stronach Group retained intellectual ownership of the Preakness, for which the MTROA pays an annual licensing fee.\nEvolution of the Triple Crown series.\nThe Preakness is the second leg in American thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown series and almost always attracts the Kentucky Derby winner, some of the other horses that ran in the Derby, and often a few horses that did not start in the Derby. The Preakness is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+3\u204416 miles, or &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;9+1\u20442 furlongs (1.88\u00a0km), compared to the Kentucky Derby, which is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20444 miles / 10 furlongs (2\u00a0km). It is followed by the third leg, the Belmont Stakes, which is &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles / 12 furlongs (2.4\u00a0km).\nSince 1932, the order of Triple Crown races has the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1932, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day.\nTo date, the Preakness is run on the third Saturday in May, two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes. Consequently, the race is run no earlier than May 15, and no later than May 21. One exception is 2020, as that race was run in early October due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTraditions.\nTraditionally, just after the horses for the Preakness were called to the post, the audience was invited to sing the third verse of \"Maryland, My Maryland\", the official state song of Maryland. For many years, the Baltimore Colts' Marching Band would lead the song from the infield; in later years, it was sung by the United States Naval Academy Glee Club. Use of the song was discontinued as of the 2020 edition of the race\u2014the song \"which celebrates the Confederacy, is considered by some to be racist.\"\nAs soon as the Preakness winner has been declared official, a painter climbs a ladder to the top of a replica of the Old Clubhouse cupola. The colors of the victorious owner's silks are applied on the jockey and horse that are part of the weather vane atop the infield structure. The practice began in 1909 when a horse and rider weather vane sat atop the old Members' Clubhouse, which was constructed when Pimlico opened in 1870. The Victorian building was destroyed by fire in June 1966. A replica of the old building's cupola was built to stand in the Preakness winner's circle in the infield.\nA blanket of yellow flowers daubed with black lacquer to recreate the appearance of a black-eyed Susan is placed around the winning horse's neck at this time, and a replica of the Woodlawn Vase is given to the winning horse's owner. Should that horse have also won the Kentucky Derby, speculation and excitement immediately begin to mount as to whether that horse will go on to win the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing at the Belmont Stakes in June.\nWinning the race.\nIn 1917, the first Woodlawn Vase was awarded to the Preakness winner, who was not allowed to keep it. Eventually, a half-size reproduction of the trophy was given to winners to keep permanently. The original trophy is kept at the Baltimore Museum of Art and brought to the race each year under guard, for the winner's presentation ceremony.\nIn 1940, it was proposed to drape the winning horse in a garland of the Maryland State flower, \"Rudbeckia hirta\", commonly called black-eyed Susans. This posed a problem, as the race is run nearly two months before the flowers come into bloom in late June or July. At first, yellow Viking daisies were painted to resemble black-eyed Susans. Painted flowers have been discontinued since the first decade of the current millennium and Viking Poms, a member of the chrysanthemum family, are now used. Although the Preakness is sometimes referred to as \"the race for the black-eyed Susans\", no black-eyed Susan is ever used.\nIn 1918, 26 horses entered the race, and it was run in two divisions, providing for two winners that year. Currently, the race is limited to 14 horses.\nIn 1948, the Preakness was televised for the first time by CBS.\nThe Preakness has been run at seven different distances:\nPurse money.\nAt its inauguration in 1873, the Preakness carried a value of $1,000. The first major increase occurred in 1919 when the race had a $25,000 value. It climbed to $100,000 in 1946 and in 1959 was raised to $150,000. Subsequent increases occurred from 1979 to 1989, when the purse rose four times from $200,000 to $500,000, before going to $1 million in 1997. On December 12, 2013, the Maryland Jockey Club announced for the 2014 running of the Preakness, the purse would be increased from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.\nInfieldFest.\nThe race has had something of a party atmosphere in the past, especially in the infield, which is general admission. The course had a \"bring your own booze\" policy until 2009, formerly including kegs of beer but in the 2000s restricted to all the beer cans a person could carry in a cooler. However, despite crowds in excess of 100,000, the BYOB policy was canceled in 2009 after videos of intoxicated people running along the tops of lines of portable toilets while being pelted by beer cans reached a large audience.\nIn 2009, with the alcohol ban, race attendance dropped to 77,850 after topping 100,000 for eight consecutive years. In 2010, and the Maryland Jockey Club responded with a new event called \"InfieldFest\" with performances by musical acts, the \"Mug Club\", which included an infield ticket and an unlimited-refill beer mug, and a mascot named \"Kegasus\", a play on keg and pegasus (though actually a centaur). The much-derided Kegasus was retired in 2013. In 2010, ticket sales had recovered to 95,760 and have since stayed high.\nAside from InfieldFest, the race is known for its fancy hats and official cocktail, the Black-eyed Susan, made with vodka, St-Germain liqueur and pineapple, lime and orange juices.\nRecords.\nSpeed record: \nSecretariat, the 1973 winner (and ultimately Triple Crown winner) was originally credited with a running time of 1:55. Two \"Daily Racing Form\" clockers, however, had timed Secretariat's Preakness in 1:53 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445, which would be a new stakes record. A hearing was held over the time discrepancy, where a video replay showed Secretariat reached the wire faster than Canonero II, the then-current record holder, but instead of giving Secretariat the record, the Maryland Jockey Club decided to split the difference and make its official time that of Pimlico's clocker, who had timed the race in 1:54 &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445. The matter was finally resolved in June 2012, when a meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission unanimously ruled to change Secretariat's final time to 1:53 based on testimony and analysis of the race replays. Consequently, Secretariat holds the current official record for all three Triple Crown races.\nOther records at other distances:\nMargin of Victory:\nMost wins by a jockey:\nMost wins by a trainer:\nMost wins by an owner:\nFillies in the Preakness.\nSix fillies have won the Preakness:\nWinners (since 1873).\nTriple Crown winners are in bold.\nTimed to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 second 1873 to 1899, to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445 second 1900 to 2002, to 0.01 second since 2003.\nAll winners have been three years old, except Montague in 1890 who was five years old.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA \u2020 designates a filly.&lt;br&gt;\n\u00a7 D. Wayne Lukas swept the 1995 Triple Crown with two different horses.\nSire lines.\nWinners of the Preakness Stakes can be connected to each other due to the practice of arranging horse breeding based on their previous success. All of the horses can be traced back to the three foundational sires, with Godolphin Arabian the ancestor of 7 winners, Byerley Turk the ancestor of 13 winners, and Darley Arabian the ancestor of 131 winners, including all winners since 1938.\nThe Mr Prospector direct sire line has produced the last 5 Preakness Stakes winners.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its purpose is to prevent unauthorized arming or detonation of a nuclear weapon.\nThe United States federal government's definition is: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A device included in or attached to a nuclear weapon system to preclude arming and/or launching until the insertion of a prescribed discrete code or combination. It may include equipment and cabling external to the weapon or weapon system to activate components within the weapon or weapon system.\nThe earliest PALs were little more than locks introduced into the control and firing systems of a nuclear weapon, designed to prevent a person from detonating it or removing its safety features. More recent innovations have included encrypting the firing parameters it is programmed with, which must be decrypted to properly detonate the warhead, and anti-tamper systems which intentionally mis-detonate the weapon if its other security features are defeated, destroying it without giving rise to a nuclear explosion.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nPermissive action links were developed in the United States in a gradual process from the first use of atomic weapons to the early 1960s. In 1953 the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense signed the \"Missiles and Rockets Agreement\", which paved the way for the development and implementation of PALs. Certain national laboratories, under the auspices of the AEC, would develop and produce nuclear weapons, while the responsibility for the use and deployment remained with the military. The laboratories were also free to conduct their own research in the field of arms control and security. The thinking behind this was that if the government would ever be interested in such a security device, the research and development of prototypes would already be well advanced. At the beginning of the 1960s, the desire for the usage of such a system grew for both political and technological reasons.\nNewer nuclear weapons were less complex in operation, relatively mass-produced (and therefore predictably similar), and less cumbersome to arm and use than previous designs. Accordingly, new methods were necessary to prevent their unauthorized use. As the Cold War came to a head in the 1960s, the government felt it best not to leave the use of nuclear weapons in the hands of possibly-renegade generals, including the commander of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Without Permissive Action Links, each nuclear weapon was effectively under the independent control of one person, the general under whose command it happened to fall.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I used to worry about the fact that [General Power] had control over so many weapons and weapon systems and could, under certain conditions, launch the force. Back in the days before we had real positive control [i.e., PAL locks], SAC had the power to do a lot of things, and it was in his hands, and he knew it. \u2014\u200a\nIn order to protect its NATO allies, the United States had stationed various nuclear weapons overseas; these weapons were thus at least under the partial control of the hosting allied state. This was especially concerning to the United States Congress, as control of these weapons by a third party was in violation of U.S. federal law. Added to this was that some of the allies were considered potentially unstable\u2014particularly West Germany and Turkey. There was considerable concern that in one of these countries the instructions of the civilian leadership of the host country could overrule that country's military. In addition, the U.S. realized that in the event of war, parts of West Germany would be overwhelmed early on, and nuclear weapons stationed there could fall into the hands of the Soviet Union.\nFor a long time the U.S. military resisted the use of PALs. It feared the loss of its own independence, and it feared malfunction, which could put warheads out of action in a time of crisis. But the advantages of PALs outweighed the disadvantages: thanks to the PALs weapons were able to be distributed to a greater extent in Europe, so as to prevent a rapid and selective destruction or conquest by the Soviet bloc, while still retaining U.S. control over the farther-flung weapons.\nDevelopment and dissemination.\nThe precursors of permissive action links were simple mechanical combination locks that were set into the control systems of nuclear weapons, such as the Minuteman ICBM. There they could perform different functions: some blocked the cavity through which the nuclear materials were shot to create a reaction; other locks blocked circuits; and some simply prevented access to the control panel. For testing, some of these mechanisms were installed during 1959 in weapons stationed in Europe.\nThe work on PAL prototypes remained at low levels until 1960. Sandia National Laboratories successfully created a number of new combination locks that were adaptable to different types of weapons. In the spring of 1961, there was a series of hearings in Congress, where Sandia presented the prototype of a special electro-mechanical lock, which was then known still as a \"proscribed action link\". The military leadership, however, soon realized that this term had negative connotations for the use of weapons by the officer corps (\"proscribed\" meaning \"prohibited\"), and decided to start calling PAL \"permissive action link\" instead (\"permissive\" meaning \"allowing\" or \"tolerating\").\nIn June 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed the National Security Action Memorandum number 160. This presidential directive ordered the installation of PALs in all U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. (U.S. nuclear weapons that were not in Europe were excluded from the order.) The conversion was completed in September 1962 and cost $23 million ($ in 2024 dollars).\nAccording to nuclear safety expert Bruce G. Blair, the US Air Force's Strategic Air Command worried that in times of need the codes for the Minuteman ICBM force would not be available, so it decided to set the codes to 00000000 in all missile launch control centers. Blair said the missile launch checklists included an item confirming this combination until 1977. A 2014 article in \"Foreign Policy\" said that the US Air Force told the United States House Committee on Armed Services that \"A code consisting of eight zeroes has never been used to enable a MM ICBM, as claimed by Dr. Bruce Blair.\" The Air Force's statement (that 00000000 was never \"used\" to enable an ICBM, i.e. the weapons were not actually launched) does not contradict Blair's statement (that 00000000 was the code for doing so).\nThe complete conversion to PAL systems was relatively slow. In 1974, U.S. Defense Secretary James Schlesinger found that a variety of tactical nuclear weapons were still not fitted with permissive action links, even though the technology had been available for some time. It took another two years until all the tactical nuclear weapons were fully equipped with PALs. In 1981, almost 20 years after the invention of PALs, just over half of U.S. nuclear weapons were still equipped only with mechanical locks. It took until 1987 until these were completely replaced.\nModernization and the present.\nOver the years the permissive action links have been continuously maintained and upgraded. In 2002, PALs on older B61 nuclear bombs were replaced and upgraded with new systems to improve reliability and security, as a part of extending the weapons' service lives to at least 2025.\nCode management system\nThe year 1995 saw the development of the code management system (CMS). The CMS has simplified the control and logistics for staff and improved the flexibility and speed in deploying and arming weapons. New codes can be used to recode, lock, and manage the weapons, while the secrecy and validity of the possible launch orders is still ensured. In total, CMS consists of fourteen custom products (nine software and five hardware products). The software products were developed by Sandia National Laboratories while the hardware was created by the National Nuclear Security Administration.\nThe CMS was fully operational for the first time in November 2001. A part of the system, a special cryptographic processor fitted into the weapons in 1997 had a potential Year 2000 problem. By the spring of 2004, all PAL systems were equipped with the CMS. It is thus currently the general foundation for future hardware and software improvements to PALs.\nFeatures.\nElements of PAL systems are located deep within the nuclear device. The design and construction attempt to create a black box system so as to limit information leakage. PALs are also linked directly or indirectly with a number of other security measures, which together form a comprehensive security package. To prevent exploitation and sniffing via power line attacks permissive action links are powered by low-maintenance radioisotope generators. Instead of conventional batteries, these generators produce electricity using the heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. Although the half-life of 238Pu is 87.7 years, these generators' lifespan is shorter than that; the alpha decay of the plutonium produces helium, causing the pressure inside the generator to increase.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Bypassing a PAL should be, as one weapons designer graphically put it, about as complex as performing a tonsillectomy while entering the patient from the wrong end.\"\u2014\u200a\nPAL devices have been installed on all nuclear devices in the US arsenal. The US Navy was last to receive them, with all weapons fitted with PALs by 1996 or 1997.\nTwo-man rule.\nModern PALs use the two-man rule, which is designed to prevent accidental or malicious launch of nuclear weapons by a single individual.\nFor example, on a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), both the commanding officer (CO) and executive officer (XO) must agree that the order to launch is valid, and then mutually authorize the launch with their operations personnel. Instead of another party confirming a missile launch as in the case of land-based ICBMs, the set of keys is distributed among the key personnel on the submarine and kept in safes (each of these crew members has access only to his keys), some of which are locked by combination locks. Nobody onboard has the combination to open these safes; the unlock key comes as a part of the launch order from the higher authority.\nIn the case of Minuteman missile launch crews, both operators must agree that the launch order is valid by comparing the order's authorization code against a code from a \"sealed authenticator\" (a special sealed envelope that holds a code). The sealed authenticators are stored in a safe that has two separate locks so that a single crew member cannot open the safe alone. Both crew members must simultaneously turn the four launch keys. An additional safeguard is provided by requiring the crew in another launch control center to do the same for the missiles to be launched.\nStronglinks and weaklinks.\nAnother part of the PAL design is the inclusion of \"stronglinks\" and \"weaklinks\". These ensure resilience to accidental activation through damage. The stronglinks include an increased ruggedness of some components and the inclusion of insensitive munitions so that they will not be circumvented by fire, vibration, or magnetic fields, leaving the PAL vulnerable to bypass after such damage. Also, activation-critical electronics within the weapon, such as capacitors, are selected so that they will fail before the safety device in the event of damage, ensuring that the weapon fails safe.\nCritical signal detection.\nNuclear weapons will only respond to a specific arming signal. This is passed to the weapon by a unique signal generator located outside the weapon. This output is specific and well-defined, precluding approximation, emulation, noise, or interference from being accepted as a false positive.\nEnvironmental sensing device.\nAn environmental sensing device (ESD) determines through environmental sensors whether the weapon is operating in its combat environment. For example, on an ICBM, a nuclear warhead would first be exposed to a strong acceleration, then a period of free fall and then further acceleration as the warhead reenters the atmosphere. The ESD determines the external parameters such as acceleration curve, temperature and pressure, and only arms the weapon when these environments are sensed in the correct order.\nESDs are not exclusive to weapons equipped with PALs and some weapons, such as the W25, also had ESDs despite not being fitted with PALs.\nLimited retry and non-violent disablement.\nModern PALs are believed to feature a limited number of code reentries before the weapon locks out, requiring that the weapon be returned to Pantex for rebuilding. This system may also include a non-violent disablement system, where some of the weapon's internal components are destroyed to hamper use. This system may be part of the ordinary limited retry lockout system, or may be a feature that can be enabled if the local situation calls for it. The non-violent disablement system may also be part of the weapon's anti-intrusion system, designed to activate if someone tries to enter one of the weapon's exclusion regions such as for the purpose of circumventing the weapon's PAL.\nVersions.\nOver the years the design and feature set of PALs has increased, as has the length of the access code. US-manufactured PALs are divided into five categories; however, the earliest PALs were never assigned a category letter.\nUsage by other states.\nThe increase in the number of nuclear-armed states was a similar cause for concern for the United States government for reasons similar to the original impetus for PALs. Thus, since the 1960s, the US has offered its own PAL technologies to other nuclear powers. The US considered this a necessary step: if the technology were kept secret, it would only be half as effective as possible, since the other power in a conflict might not have such safety measures.\nIn the early 1970s, France was an early recipient of United States assistance on this critical element of nuclear security. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) went into effect in 1970 and precluded treaty members (including the US) from directly disseminating technology related to nuclear weapons development or enhancement. In order to get around this prohibition, the US developed a legal trick: \"negative guidance\". French nuclear scientists would regularly brief US scientists on French developments in the field of PALs, and the US scientists would tell their French counterparts when they were not on the right track. In 1971, the US also offered its technology to the Soviet Union, which developed a similar system.\nIn the early 1990s, the People's Republic of China requested information to develop its own PALs. The Clinton administration believed that to do so would give too much information to the Chinese about American weapon design, and therefore, refused the request.\nFollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had on its territory the world's third largest nuclear weapons stockpile. While Ukraine had physical control of the weapons, it did not have operational control of the weapons as they were dependent on Russian-controlled electronic permissive action links and the Russian command-and-control system. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to the destruction of the weapons, and to join the NPT.\nDetailed information about PAL systems design and their use is classified, although these mechanisms have been offered to Pakistan for protection of their nuclear weapons. In the end, the US decided that it could not do so for legal reasons; the Pakistanis were also concerned that such technology would be sabotaged by a \"kill-switch\" that the US could operate. However, many experts in the field of nuclear technology in the US government supported the publication of the PAL system because they considered Pakistan's arsenal as the world's most vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Whether it's India or Pakistan or China or Iran, the most important thing is that you want to make sure there is no unauthorized use. You want to make sure that the guys who have their hands on the weapons can't use them without proper authorization.\u2014\u200a\nIn November 2007, \"The New York Times\" revealed that the US had invested $100 million since 2001 in a secret program to protect Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. Instead of transferring PAL technology, the US provided helicopters, night vision and nuclear detection devices, as well as training to Pakistani personnel in order to prevent the theft or misuse of Pakistan's nuclear material, warheads, and laboratories. According to the Pentagon officials and the U.S. military accounts, Pakistan is believed to have developed and coded its own version of the PAL technology, and they believe Pakistan's nuclear arsenals to be well secured.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The integers 23 and 32 are two perfect powers (that is, powers of exponent higher than one) of natural numbers whose values (8 and 9, respectively) are consecutive. The theorem states that this is the \"only\" case of two consecutive perfect powers. That is to say, that \nHistory.\nThe history of the problem dates back at least to Gersonides, who proved a special case of the conjecture in 1343 where (\"x\", \"y\") was restricted to be (2, 3) or (3, 2). The first significant progress after Catalan made his conjecture came in 1850 when Victor-Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Lebesgue dealt with the case \"b\" = 2.\nIn 1976, Robert Tijdeman applied Baker's method in transcendence theory to establish a bound on \"a\",\"b\" and used existing results bounding \"x\",\"y\" in terms of \"a\", \"b\" to give an effective upper bound for \"x\",\"y\",\"a\",\"b\". Michel Langevin computed a value of formula_1 for the bound, resolving Catalan's conjecture for all but a finite number of cases.\nCatalan's conjecture was proven by Preda Mih\u0103ilescu in April 2002. The proof was published in the \"Journal f\u00fcr die reine und angewandte Mathematik\", 2004. It makes extensive use of the theory of cyclotomic fields and Galois modules. An exposition of the proof was given by Yuri Bilu in the S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki. In 2005, Mih\u0103ilescu published a simplified proof.\nPillai's conjecture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Unsolved/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnsolved problem in mathematics\nDoes each positive integer occur only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers?\nMore unsolved problems in mathematics\nPillai's conjecture concerns a general difference of perfect powers (sequence in the OEIS): it is an open problem initially proposed by S. S. Pillai, who conjectured that the gaps in the sequence of perfect powers tend to infinity. This is equivalent to saying that each positive integer occurs only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers: more generally, in 1931 Pillai conjectured that for fixed positive integers \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" the equation formula_2 has only finitely many solutions (\"x\",\u00a0\"y\",\u00a0\"m\",\u00a0\"n\") with (\"m\",\u00a0\"n\") \u2260 (2,\u00a02). Pillai proved that for fixed \"A\", \"B\", \"x\", \"y\", and for any \u03bb less than 1, we have formula_3 uniformly in \"m\" and \"n\".\nThe general conjecture would follow from the ABC conjecture.\nPillai's conjecture means that for every natural number \"n\", there are only finitely many pairs of perfect powers with difference \"n\". The list below shows, for \"n\"\u00a0\u2264\u00a064, all solutions for perfect powers less than 1018, such that the exponent of both powers is greater than 1. The number of such solutions for each \"n\" is listed at (sequence in the OEIS).

{"id": "62385", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62385", "title": "Beatnik", "text": "Media stereotype based on characteristics of the Beat Generation\nBeatniks were members of a social movement in the mid-20th century, who subscribed to an anti-materialistic lifestyle. They rejected the conformity and consumerism of mainstream American culture and expressed themselves through various forms of art, such as literature, poetry, music, and painting. They also experimented with spirituality, drugs, sexuality, and travel. The term \"beatnik\" was coined by \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Herb Caen in 1958, as a derogatory label for the followers of the Beat Generation, a group of influential writers and artists who emerged during the era of the Silent Generation's maturing, from as early as 1946, to as late as 1963, but the subculture was at its most prevalent in the 1950s. This lifestyle of anti-consumerism may have been influenced by their generation living in extreme poverty in the Great Depression during their formative years, seeing slightly older people serve in WWII and being influenced by the rise of left-wing politics and the spread of Communism. The name was inspired by the Russian suffix \"-nik\", which was used to denote members of various political or social groups. The term \"beat\" originally was used by Jack Kerouac in 1948 to describe his social circle of friends and fellow writers, such as Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Kerouac said that \"beat\" had multiple meanings, such as \"beaten down\", \"beatific\", \"beat up\", and \"beat out\". He also associated it with the musical term \"beat\", which referred to the rhythmic patterns of jazz, a genre that influenced many beatniks.\nBeatniks often were stereotyped as wearing black clothing, berets, sunglasses, and goatees, and speaking in hip slang that incorporated words like \"cool\", \"dig\", \"groovy\", and \"square\". They frequented coffeehouses, bookstores, bars, and clubs, where they listened to jazz, read poetry, discussed philosophy, and engaged in political activism. Some of the most famous beatnik venues were the Six Gallery in San Francisco, where Ginsberg first read his poem \"Howl\" in 1955; the Gaslight Cafe in New York City, where many poets performed; and the City Lights Bookstore, also in San Francisco, where Kerouac's novel \"On the Road\" was published in 1957. Beatniks also traveled across the country and abroad, seeking new experiences and inspiration. Some of their destinations included Mexico, Morocco, India, Japan, and France.\nBeatniks had a significant impact on American culture and society as they challenged the norms and values of their time. They influenced many aspects of art, literature, music, film, fashion, and language. They also inspired many social movements and subcultures that followed them, such as the hippies, the counterculture, the New Left, the environmental movement, and the LGBT movement. Some of the more notable figures who were influenced by or associated with beatniks include Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Andy Warhol, Ken Kesey, and Timothy Leary. Beatniks have been portrayed or parodied in many works of fiction, such as \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\", \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", \"The Munsters\", \"The Flintstones\", \"The Simpsons\", and \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\nHistory.\nIn 1948, Jack Kerouac introduced the phrase \"Beat Generation\", generalizing from his social circle to characterize the underground, anti-conformist youth gathering in New York City at that time. The name came up in conversation with John Clellon Holmes, who published an early Beat Generation novel titled \"Go\" (1952), along with the manifesto \"This Is the Beat Generation\" in \"The New York Times Magazine\". In 1954, Nolan Miller published his third novel \"Why I Am So Beat\" (Putnam), detailing the weekend parties of four students.\n\"Beat\" came from underworld slang\u2014the world of hustlers, drug addicts, and petty thieves\u2014from which Allen Ginsberg and Kerouac sought inspiration. \"Beat\" was slang for \"beaten down\" or \"downtrodden\". However, to Kerouac and Ginsberg, it also had a spiritual connotation, as in \"beatitude\". Other adjectives discussed by Holmes and Kerouac were \"found\" and \"furtive\". Kerouac felt he had identified (and was the embodiment of) a new trend analogous to the influential Lost Generation.\nIn \"Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation\", Kerouac criticized what he saw as a distortion of his visionary, spiritual ideas:\nThe Beat Generation, that was a vision that we had, John Clellon Holmes and I, and Allen Ginsberg in an even wilder way, in the late Forties, of a generation of crazy, illuminated hipsters suddenly rising and roaming America, serious, bumming and hitchhiking everywhere, ragged, beatific, beautiful in an ugly graceful new way\u2014a vision gleaned from the way we had heard the word \"beat\" spoken on street corners on Times Square and in the Village, in other cities in the downtown city night of postwar America\u2014beat, meaning down and out but full of intense conviction. We'd even heard old 1910 Daddy Hipsters of the streets speak the word that way, with a melancholy sneer. It never meant juvenile delinquents, it meant characters of a special spirituality who didn't gang up but were solitary Bartlebies staring out the dead wall window of our civilization ...\nKerouac explained what he meant by \"beat\" at a Brandeis Forum, \"Is There A Beat Generation?\", on November 8, 1958, at New York's Hunter College Playhouse. The seminar's panelists were Kerouac, James A. Wechsler, Princeton anthropologist Ashley Montagu and author Kingsley Amis. Wechsler, Montagu, and Amis wore suits, while Kerouac was clad in black jeans, ankle boots and a checkered shirt. Reading from a prepared text, Kerouac reflected on his beat beginnings:\nIt is because I am Beat, that is, I believe in beatitude and that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son to it ... Who knows, but that the universe is not one vast sea of compassion actually, the veritable holy honey, beneath all this show of personality and cruelty?\nKerouac's statement was later published as \"The Origins of the Beat Generation\" (\"Playboy\", June 1959). In that article, Kerouac noted how his original beatific philosophy had been ignored amid maneuvers by several pundits, among them San Francisco newspaper columnist Herb Caen, to alter Kerouac's concept with jokes and jargon:\nI went one afternoon to the church of my childhood and had a vision of what I must have really meant with \"Beat\"...the vision of the word Beat as being to mean beatific...People began to call themselves beatniks, beats, jazzniks, bopniks, buggies, and finally, I was called the \"avatar\" of all this.\nIn light of what he considered beat to mean and what beatnik had come to mean, Kerouac said to a reporter \"I'm not a beatnik. I'm a Catholic\", showing the reporter a painting of Pope Paul VI and saying \"You know who painted that? Me.\"\nStereotype.\nIn her memoir \"Minor Characters\", Joyce Johnson described how the stereotype was absorbed into American culture:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"Beat Generation\" sold books, sold black turtleneck sweaters and bongos, berets and dark glasses, sold a way of life that seemed like dangerous fun\u2014thus to be either condemned or imitated. Suburban couples could have beatnik parties on Saturday nights and drink too much and fondle each other's wives.\nKerouac biographer Ann Charters noted that the term \"Beat\" was appropriated to become a Madison Avenue marketing tool:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The term caught on because it could mean anything. It could even be exploited in the affluent wake of the decade's extraordinary technological inventions. Almost immediately, for example, advertisements by \"hip\" record companies in New York used the idea of the Beat Generation to sell their new long-playing vinyl records.\nLee Streiff, an acquaintance of many members of the movement who went on to become one of its chroniclers, believed that the news media saddled the movement for the long term with a set of false images:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Reporters are not generally well-versed in artistic movements, or the history of literature or art. And most are certain that their readers, or viewers, are of limited intellectual ability and must have things explained simply, in any case. Thus, the reporters in the media tried to relate something that was new to already preexisting frameworks and images that were only vaguely appropriate in their efforts to explain and simplify. With a variety of oversimplified and conventional formulas at their disposal, they fell back on the nearest stereotypical approximation of what the phenomenon resembled, as they saw it. And even worse, they did not see it clearly and completely at that. They got a quotation here and a photograph there\u2014and it was their job to wrap it up in a comprehensible package\u2014and if it seemed to violate the prevailing mandatory conformist doctrine, they would also be obliged to give it a negative spin as well. And in this, they were aided and abetted by the Poetic Establishment of the day. Thus, what came out in the media: from newspapers, magazines, TV, and the movies, was a product of the stereotypes of the 30s and 40s\u2014though garbled\u2014of a cross between a 1920s Greenwich Village bohemian artist and a Bop musician, whose visual image was completed by mixing in Daliesque paintings, a beret, a Vandyck beard, a turtleneck sweater, a pair of sandals, and set of bongo drums. A few authentic elements were added to the collective image: poets reading their poems, for example, but even this was made unintelligible by making all of the poets speak in some kind of phony Bop idiom. The consequence is, that even though we may know now that these images do not accurately reflect the reality of the Beat movement, we still subconsciously look for them when we look back to the 50s. We have not even yet completely escaped the visual imagery that has been so insistently forced upon us.\nEtymology.\nThe origin of the word \"beatnik\" is traditionally ascribed to Herb Caen from his column in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" on April 2, 1958, where he wrote \"\"Look\" magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.'s Beat Generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 Beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles' free booze. They're only Beat, y'know, when it comes to work ...\" It is claimed that Caen coined the term by adding the Yiddish suffix \"-nik\" (ultimately borrowed into Yiddish from Slavic languages) to \"Beat\" as in the Beat Generation. Nik, as a suffix was also in vogue due to the Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit the planet, in 1957. The suffix came to be used in colloquial synthetics such as Nogoodnik, etc.\nAn earlier source from 1954, or possibly 1957 after the launch of Sputnik, is ascribed to Ethel (Etya) Gechtoff, the well-known owner of a San Francisco Art Gallery.\nObjecting to the term, Allen Ginsberg wrote to \"The New York Times\" to deplore \"the foul word beatnik\", commenting, \"If beatniks and not illuminated Beat poets overrun this country, they will have been created not by Kerouac but by industries of mass communication which continue to brainwash man.\"\nBeat culture.\nIn the vernacular of the period, \"Beat\" referred to Beat culture, attitude and literature; while \"beatnik\" referred to a stereotype found in cartoon drawings and (in some cases at worst) twisted, sometimes violent media characters. In 1995, film scholar Ray Carney wrote about the authentic beat attitude as differentiated from stereotypical media portrayals of the beatnik:\nMuch of Beat culture represented a negative stance rather than a positive one. It was animated more by a vague feeling of cultural and emotional displacement, dissatisfaction, and yearning, than by a specific purpose or program ... It was many different, conflicting, shifting states of mind.\nSince 1958, the terms Beat Generation and Beat have been used to describe the antimaterialistic literary movement that began with Kerouac in the 1940s and continued into the 1960s. The Beat philosophy of antimaterialism and soul searching influenced 1960s musicians such as Bob Dylan, the early Pink Floyd and The Beatles.\nMusic and fashion.\nHowever, the soundtrack of the beat movement was the modern jazz pioneered by saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, which the media dubbed bebop. Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg spent much of their time in New York jazz clubs such as the Royal Roost, Minton's Playhouse, Birdland and the Open Door, \"shooting the breeze\" and \"digging the music\". Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis rapidly became what Ginsberg dubbed \"secret heroes\" to this group of aesthetes. The Beat authors borrowed much from the jazz/hipster slang of the 1940s, peppering their works with words such as \"square\", \"cats\", \"cool\" and \"dig\".\nAt the time the term \"beatnik\" was coined, a trend existed among young college students to adopt the stereotype. Men emulated the trademark look of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie by wearing goatees, horn-rimmed glasses and berets, rolling their own cigarettes, and playing bongos. Fashions for women included black leotards and long, straight, unadorned hair, in a rebellion against the middle-class culture of beauty salons. Marijuana use was associated with the subculture, and during the 1950s, Aldous Huxley's \"The Doors of Perception\" further influenced views on drugs.\nBy 1960, a small \"beatnik\" group in Newquay, Cornwall, England (including a young Wizz Jones) had attracted the attention and abhorrence of their neighbours for growing their hair beyond shoulder length, resulting in a television interview with Alan Whicker on BBC television's \"Tonight\" series.\nPhilosophy and religion.\nThe Beat philosophy was generally countercultural and antimaterialistic, and stressed the importance of bettering one's inner self over material possessions. Some Beat writers, such as Gary Snyder, began to delve into Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Taoism. Politics tended to be liberal, left-wing and anti-war, with support for causes such as desegregation (although many of the figures associated with the original Beat movement, particularly Kerouac, embraced libertarian and conservative ideas). An openness to African American culture and arts was apparent in literature and music, notably jazz. While Caen and other writers implied a connection with communism, no obvious or direct connection occurred between Beat philosophy, as expressed by the literary movement's leading authors, and that of the communist movement, other than the antipathy both philosophies shared towards capitalism. Those with only a superficial familiarity with the Beat movement often saw this similarity and assumed the two movements had more in common.\nThe Beat movement introduced Asian religions to Western society. These religions provided the Beat generation with new views of the world and corresponded with its desire to rebel against conservative middle-class values of the 1950s, old post-1930s radicalism, mainstream culture, and institutional religions in America.\nBy 1958, many Beat writers published writings on Buddhism. This was the year Jack Kerouac published his novel \"The Dharma Bums\", whose central character (whom Kerouac based on himself) sought Buddhist contexts for events in his life.\nAllen Ginsberg's spiritual journey to India in 1963 also influenced the Beat movement. After studying religious texts alongside monks, Ginsberg deduced that what linked the function of poetry to Asian religions was their mutual goal of achieving ultimate truth. His discovery of Hindu mantra chants, a form of oral delivery, subsequently influenced Beat poetry. Beat pioneers who followed a Buddhism-influenced spiritual path felt that Asian religions offered a profound understanding of human nature and insights into the being, existence and reality of mankind. Many of the Beat advocates believed that the core concepts of Asian religious philosophies had the means of elevating American society's consciousness, and these concepts informed their main ideologies.\nNotable Beat writers such as Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder were drawn to Buddhism to the extent that they each, at different periods in their lives, followed a spiritual path in their quests to provide answers to universal questions and concepts. As a result, the Beat philosophy stressed the bettering of the inner self and the rejection of materialism, and postulated that East Asian religions could fill a religious and spiritual void in the lives of many Americans.\nMany scholars speculate that Beat writers wrote about Eastern religions to encourage young people to practice spiritual and sociopolitical action. Progressive concepts from these religions, particularly those regarding personal freedom, influenced youth culture to challenge capitalist domination, break their generation's dogmas, and reject traditional gender and racial rules.\nArt.\n\"Beatnik art\" is the direction of contemporary art that originated in the United States as part of the beat movement in the 1960s. The movement itself, unlike the so-called \"Lost Generation\" did not set itself the task of changing society, but tried to distance itself from it, while at the same time trying to create its own counter-culture. The art created by artists was influenced by jazz, drugs, occultism, and other attributes of beat movement.\nThe scope of the activity was concentrated in the cultural circles of New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and North Carolina. Prominent representatives of the trend were artists Wallace Berman, Jay DeFeo, Jess Collins, Robert Frank, Claes Oldenburg and Larry Rivers.\nThe culture of the beat generation has become a kind of intersection for representatives of the creative intellect of the United States associated with visual and performing art, which are usually attributed to other areas and trends of artistic expression, such as assemblage, happening, funk art and Neo-Dadaism. They made efforts to destroy the wall between art and real life, so that art would become a living experience in cafes or jazz clubs, and not remain the prerogative of galleries and museums. Many works of artists of the movement were created on the verge of various types of art.\nArtists wrote poetry and poets painted, something like this can describe the processes taking place within the framework of the movement. Performances were a key element in the art of beats, whether it was the Theatrical Event of 1952 at Black Mountain College or Jack Kerouac typing in 1951 the novel \"On the Road\" on a typewriter in a single session on a single roll of 31-meter long paper.\nRepresentatives of the movement were united by hostility to traditional culture with its conformism and brightly degenerate commercial component. They also did not like the approach of traditional culture to hushing up the dark side of American life \u2013 violence, corruption, social inequality, racism. They tried through art to create a new way of life based on the ideals of rebellion and freedom.\nCritics highlight the artist Wallace Berman as the main representative of the movement. In his work concentrated many of the characteristic features of hipsters, especially in his collages made on photocopied photographs, which are a mixture of elements of pop art and mysticism. Among other artists and works, one can single out the work \"The Rose\" by the artist Jay DeFeo, the work on which was carried out for seven years, a huge painting-assembly weighing about a ton with a width of up to 20 centimeters.\nBeatnik books.\nAlan Bisbort's survey \"Beatniks: A Guide to an American Subculture\" was published by Greenwood Press in 2009 as part of the series \"Greenwood Press Guides to Subcultures and Countercultures\". The book includes a timeline, a glossary and biographical sketches. Others in the Greenwood series: \"Punks\", \"Hippies\", \"Goths\" and \"Flappers\".\n\"Tales of Beatnik Glory: Volumes I and II\" by Ed Sanders is, as its name suggests, a collection of short stories, and a definitive introduction to the beatnik scene as lived by its participants. The author, who went on to found The Fugs, lived in the beatnik epicenter of Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side in the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nAmong the humor books, \"Beat, Beat, Beat\" was a 1959 Signet paperback of cartoons by Phi Beta Kappa Princeton graduate William F. Brown, who looked down on the movement from his position in the TV department of the Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn advertising agency.\n\"Suzuki Beane\" (1961), by Sandra Scoppettone with Louise Fitzhugh illustrations, was a Bleecker Street beatnik spoof of Kay Thompson's \"Eloise\" series (1956\u20131959).\nIn the 1960s comic book, the Justice League of America's sidekick Snapper Carr was portrayed as a stereotypical beatnik, down to his lingo and clothes. The DC Comics character Jonny Double is portrayed as a beatnik.\nMuseums.\nIn San Francisco, Jerry and Estelle Cimino operate their Beat Museum, which began in 2003 in Monterey, California and moved to San Francisco in 2006.\nEd \"Big Daddy\" Roth used fiberglass to build his Beatnik Bandit in 1960. Today, this car is in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They include both mobile and sessile forms, found in freshwater and marine environments, especially at some depth.\nCharacteristics.\nIndividuals are unicellular and spherical, usually around 30\u201380 \u03bcm in diameter, and covered with long radial axopods, narrow cellular projections that capture food and allow mobile forms to move about.\nA few genera have no cell covering, but most have a gelatinous coat holding scales and spines, produced in special deposition vesicles. These may be organic or siliceous and come in various shapes and sizes. For instance, in \"Raphidiophrys\" the coat extends along the bases of the axopods, covering them with curved spicules that give them a pine-treeish look, and in \"Raphidiocystis\" there are both short cup-shaped spicules and long tubular spicules that are only a little shorter than the axopods. Some other common genera include \"Heterophrys\", \"Actinocystis\", and \"Oxnerella\".\nThe axopods of centrohelids are supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array, which arise from a tripartite granule called the \"centroplast\" at the center of the cell. Axopods with a similar array occur in gymnosphaerids, which have traditionally been considered centrohelids (though sometimes in a separate order from the others). This was questioned when it was found they have mitochondria with tubular cristae, as do other heliozoa, while in centrohelids the cristae are flat. Although this is no longer considered a very reliable character, on balance gymnosphaerids seem to be a separate group.\nTaxonomy.\nHistory.\nThe evolutionary position of the centrohelids is not clear. Structural comparisons with other groups are difficult, in part because no flagella occur among centrohelids, and genetic studies have been more or less inconclusive. Cavalier-Smith has suggested they may be related to the Rhizaria, but for the most part they are left with uncertain relations to other groups. A 2009 paper suggests that they may be related to the cryptophytes and haptophytes (see Cryptomonads-haptophytes assemblage). They are currently classified as Hacrobia, under the Plants+HC clade, although some research studies have found evidence against the monophyly of this group.\nCentrohelids were previously divided into two orders with contrasting scale morphology and ultrastructure: Pterocystida and Acanthocystida. Posterior molecular studies of 2018 have rearranged the classification of centrohelids into two taxa: Pterocystida and Panacanthocystida, which includes both Acanthocystida and the genus \"Yogsothoth\".\nClassification.\nThe modern classification of centrohelids, as of 2019:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is traditionally used for rabbit-hunting in the rocky terrain of the islands; the Maltese name means \"rabbit dog\". \nIt is classified by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale in its \"Spitz and primitive\" group, and shows similarities to other Mediterranean breeds in that group such as the Cirneco dell'Etna, the Podenco Andaluz, the Podenco Canario, the Podenco Ibicenco and the Portuguese Podengo. It is the only Maltese dog breed with international recognition.\nHistory.\nThe Kelb tal-Fenek is a traditional breed of rural Malta. As the English-language exonym suggests, it is sometimes claimed that the Pharaoh Hound descends from the dogs shown in the tomb paintings of Ancient Egypt.25 Modern DNA studies suggest that the breed is not of ancient origin, but a moderately recent development from various other breeds.231160 It apparently became genetically distinct from the Sicilian Cirneco dell'Etna no more than two hundred years ago.\nIn 1647 Giovanni Francesco Abela, in his \"Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichit\u00e0, ed altre notizie\", wrote \"... we have the dogs called Cernechi, much valued for rabbit-hunting, which are often in demand as far away as France, mainly for [use in] steep and stony mountain terrain\". Some have taken this to refer to the Kelb tal-Fenek. The modern Cirneco is a Sicilian breed of similar structure and appearance to the Kelb tal-Fenek, but somewhat smaller.\nThe first litter to be born outside Malta was in the United Kingdom in 1963. The breed was accepted by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Cynologique Internationale as the \"Pharaoh Hound\" in the same year, under the patronage of the UK. A breed standard was approved by the British Kennel Club in 1974.\nAppearance.\nThe Kelb tal-Fenek is slender and graceful. The head is long and finely chiselled, with a slight stop. The coat is glossy and short. It may be chestnut or tan; white patches on the back, sides, shoulder or back of the neck are a disqualifying characteristic, but the tip of the tail may be white. The eyes are amber-coloured. The dogs have an unusual trait of \"blushing\" when excited or happy, with their ears and noses becoming bright pink.\nIt has little genetic pre-disposition to disease, and may be expected to live for some 11 to 14 years.\nUse.\nThe Kelb tal-Fenek is usually taken out to hunt at night when there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters take their dogs into the countryside and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting too far to the sides. At this point the dogs giving chase emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit has almost always gone to ground. The hunters then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter takes a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 metres down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. The use of ferrets is mentioned by Strabo about rabbit-hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule.489\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It works by inserting one or more electrodes into a plasma, with a constant or time-varying electric potential between the various electrodes or between them and the surrounding vessel. The measured currents and potentials in this system allow the determination of the physical properties of the plasma.\n\"I-V\" characteristic of the Debye sheath.\nThe beginning of Langmuir probe theory is the \"I\u2013V\" characteristic of the Debye sheath, that is, the current density flowing to a surface in a plasma as a function of the voltage drop across the sheath. The analysis presented here indicates how the electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential can be derived from the \"I\u2013V\" characteristic. In some situations a more detailed analysis can yield information on the ion density (formula_1), the ion temperature formula_2, or the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) or formula_3.\nIon saturation current density.\nConsider first a surface biased to a large negative voltage. If the voltage is large enough, essentially all electrons (and any negative ions) will be repelled. The ion velocity will satisfy the Bohm sheath criterion, which is, strictly speaking, an inequality, but which is usually marginally fulfilled. The Bohm criterion in its marginal form says that the ion velocity at the sheath edge is simply the sound speed given by\nformula_4.\nThe ion temperature term is often neglected, which is justified if the ions are cold. \"Z\" is the (average) charge state of the ions, and formula_5 is the adiabatic coefficient for the ions. The proper choice of formula_5 is a matter of some contention. Most analyses use formula_7, corresponding to isothermal ions, but some kinetic theory suggests that formula_8. For formula_9 and formula_10, using the larger value results in the conclusion that the density is formula_11 times smaller. Uncertainties of this magnitude arise several places in the analysis of Langmuir probe data and are very difficult to resolve.\nThe charge density of the ions depends on the charge state \"Z\", but quasineutrality allows one to write it simply in terms of the electron density as formula_12, where formula_13 is the charge of an electron and formula_14 is the number density of electrons.\nUsing these results we have the current density to the surface due to the ions. The current density at large negative voltages is due solely to the ions and, except for possible sheath expansion effects, does not depend on the bias voltage, so it is\nreferred to as the ion saturation current density and is given by\nformula_15 where formula_16 is as defined above.\nThe plasma parameters, in particular, the density, are those at the sheath edge.\nExponential electron current.\nAs the voltage of the Debye sheath is reduced, the more energetic electrons are able to overcome the potential barrier of the electrostatic sheath. We can model the electrons at the sheath edge with a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution, i.e.,\nformula_17,\nexcept that the high energy tail moving away from the surface is missing, because only the lower energy electrons moving toward the surface are reflected. The higher energy electrons overcome the sheath potential and are absorbed. The mean velocity of the electrons which are able to overcome the voltage of the sheath is\nformula_18,\nwhere the cut-off velocity for the upper integral is\nformula_19.\nformula_20 is the voltage across the Debye sheath, that is, the potential at the sheath edge minus the potential of the surface. For a large voltage compared to the electron temperature, the result is\nformula_21.\nWith this expression, we can write the electron contribution to the current to the probe in terms of the ion saturation current as\nformula_22,\nvalid as long as the electron current is not more than two or three times the ion current.\nFloating potential.\nThe total current, of course, is the sum of the ion and electron currents:\nformula_23.\nWe are using the convention that current \"from\" the surface into the plasma is positive. An interesting and practical question is the potential of a surface to which no net current flows. It is easily seen from the above equation that\nformula_24.\nIf we introduce the ion reduced mass formula_25, we can write\nformula_26\nSince the floating potential is the experimentally accessible quantity, the current (below electron saturation) is usually written as \nformula_27.\nElectron saturation current.\nWhen the electrode potential is equal to or greater than the plasma potential, then there is no longer a sheath to reflect electrons, and the electron current saturates. Using the Boltzmann expression for the mean electron velocity given above with formula_28 and setting the ion current to zero, the electron saturation current density would be\nformula_29\nAlthough this is the expression usually given in theoretical discussions of Langmuir probes, the derivation is not rigorous and the experimental basis is weak. The theory of double layers typically employs an expression analogous to the Bohm criterion, but with the roles of electrons and ions reversed, namely\nformula_30\nwhere the numerical value was found by taking \"T\"\"i\"=\"T\"\"e\" and \u03b3\"i\"=\u03b3\"e\".\nIn practice, it is often difficult and usually considered uninformative to measure the electron saturation current experimentally. When it is measured, it is found to be highly variable and generally much lower (a factor of three or more) than the value given above. Often a clear saturation is not seen at all. Understanding electron saturation is one of the most important outstanding problems of Langmuir probe theory.\nEffects of the bulk plasma.\nThe Debye sheath theory explains the basic behavior of Langmuir probes, but is not complete. Merely inserting an object like a probe into a plasma changes the density, temperature, and potential at the sheath edge and perhaps everywhere. Changing the voltage on the probe will also, in general, change various plasma parameters. Such effects are less well understood than sheath physics, but they can at least in some cases be roughly accounted.\nPre-sheath.\nThe Bohm criterion requires the ions to enter the Debye sheath at the sound speed. The potential drop that accelerates them to this speed is called the pre-sheath. It has a spatial scale that depends on the physics of the ion source but which is large compared to the Debye length and often of the order of the plasma dimensions. The magnitude of the potential drop is equal to (at least)\nformula_31\nThe acceleration of the ions also entails a decrease in the density, usually by a factor of about 2 depending on the details.\nResistivity.\nCollisions between ions and electrons will also affect the \"I-V\" characteristic of a Langmuir probe. When an electrode is biased to any voltage other than the floating potential, the current it draws must pass through the plasma, which has a finite resistivity. The resistivity and current path can be calculated with relative ease in an unmagnetized plasma. In a magnetized plasma, the problem is much more difficult. In either case, the effect is to add a voltage drop proportional to the current drawn, which shears the characteristic. The deviation from an exponential function is usually not possible to observe directly, so that the flattening of the characteristic is usually misinterpreted as a larger plasma temperature. Looking at it from the other side, any measured \"I-V\" characteristic can be interpreted as a hot plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the Debye sheath, or as a cold plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the bulk plasma. Without quantitative modeling of the bulk resistivity, Langmuir probes can only give an upper limit on the electron temperature.\nSheath expansion.\nIt is not enough to know the current \"density\" as a function of bias voltage since it is the \"absolute\" current which is measured. In an unmagnetized plasma, the current-collecting area is usually taken to be the exposed surface area of the electrode. In a magnetized plasma, the projected area is taken, that is, the area of the electrode as viewed along the magnetic field. If the electrode is not shadowed by a wall or other nearby object, then the area must be doubled to account for current coming along the field from both sides. If the electrode dimensions are not small in comparison to the Debye length, then the size of the electrode is effectively increased in all directions by the sheath thickness. In a magnetized plasma, the electrode is sometimes assumed to be increased in a similar way by the ion Larmor radius.\nThe finite Larmor radius allows some ions to reach the electrode that would have otherwise gone past it. The details of the effect have not been calculated in a fully self-consistent way.\nIf we refer to the probe area including these effects as formula_32 (which may be a function of the bias voltage) and make the assumptions\nand ignore the effects of\nthen the \"I-V\" characteristic becomes\nformula_37,\nwhere\nformula_38.\nMagnetized plasmas.\nThe theory of Langmuir probes is much more complex when the plasma is magnetized. The simplest extension of the unmagnetized case is simply to use the projected area rather than the surface area of the electrode. For a long cylinder far from other surfaces, this reduces the effective area by a factor of \u03c0/2 = 1.57. As mentioned before, it might be necessary to increase the radius by about the thermal ion Larmor radius, but not above the effective area for the unmagnetized case.\nThe use of the projected area seems to be closely tied with the existence of a magnetic sheath. Its scale is the ion Larmor radius at the sound speed, which is normally between the scales of the Debye sheath and the pre-sheath. The Bohm criterion for ions entering the magnetic sheath applies to the motion along the field, while at the entrance to the Debye sheath it applies to the motion normal to the surface. This results in a reduction of the density by the sine of the angle between the field and the surface. The associated increase in the Debye length must be taken into account when considering ion non-saturation due to sheath effects.\nEspecially interesting and difficult to understand is the role of cross-field currents. Naively, one would expect the current to be parallel to the magnetic field along a flux tube. In many geometries, this flux tube will end at a surface in a distant part of the device, and this spot should itself exhibit an \"I-V\" characteristic. The net result would be the measurement of a double-probe characteristic; in other words, electron saturation current equal to the ion saturation current.\nWhen this picture is considered in detail, it is seen that the flux tube must charge up and the surrounding plasma must spin around it. The current into or out of the flux tube must be associated with a force that slows down this spinning. Candidate forces are viscosity, friction with neutrals, and inertial forces associated with plasma flows, either steady or fluctuating. It is not known which force is strongest in practice, and in fact it is generally difficult to find any force that is powerful enough to explain the characteristics actually measured.\nIt is also likely that the magnetic field plays a decisive role in determining the level of electron saturation, but no quantitative theory is as yet available.\nElectrode configurations.\nOnce one has a theory of the \"I-V\" characteristic of an electrode, one can proceed to measure it and then fit the data with the theoretical curve to extract the plasma parameters. The straightforward way to do this is to sweep the voltage on a single electrode, but, for a number of reasons, configurations using multiple electrodes or exploring only a part of the characteristic are used in practice.\nSingle probe.\nThe most straightforward way to measure the \"I-V\" characteristic of a plasma is with a single probe, consisting of one electrode biased with a voltage ramp relative to the vessel. The advantages are simplicity of the electrode and redundancy of information, i.e. one can check whether the \"I-V\" characteristic has the expected form. Potentially additional information can be extracted from details of the characteristic. The disadvantages are more complex biasing and measurement electronics and a poor time resolution. If fluctuations are present (as they always are) and the sweep is slower than the fluctuation frequency (as it usually is), then the \"I-V\" is the \"average\" current as a function of voltage, which may result in systematic errors if it is analyzed as though it were an instantaneous \"I-V\". The ideal situation is to sweep the voltage at a frequency above the fluctuation frequency but still below the ion cyclotron frequency. This, however, requires sophisticated electronics and a great deal of care.\nDouble probe.\nAn electrode can be biased relative to a second electrode, rather than to the ground. The theory is similar to that of a single probe, except that the current is limited to the ion saturation current for both positive and negative voltages. In particular, if formula_39 is the voltage applied between two identical electrodes, the current is given by;\nformula_40,\nwhich can be rewritten using formula_41 as a hyperbolic tangent:\nformula_42.\nOne advantage of the double probe is that neither electrode is ever very far above floating, so the theoretical uncertainties at large electron currents are avoided. If it is desired to sample more of the exponential electron portion of the characteristic, an asymmetric double probe may be used, with one electrode larger than the other. If the ratio of the collection areas is larger than the square root of the ion to electron mass ratio, then this arrangement is equivalent to the single tip probe. If the ratio of collection areas is not that big, then the characteristic will be in-between the symmetric double tip configuration and the single-tip configuration. If formula_43 is the area of the larger tip then:\nformula_44\nAnother advantage is that there is no reference to the vessel, so it is to some extent immune to the disturbances in a radio frequency plasma. On the other hand, it shares the limitations of a single probe concerning complicated electronics and poor time resolution. In addition, the second electrode not only complicates the system, but it makes it susceptible to disturbance by gradients in the plasma.\nTriple probe.\nAn elegant electrode configuration is the triple probe, consisting of two electrodes biased with a fixed voltage and a third which is floating. The bias voltage is chosen to be a few times the electron temperature so that the negative electrode draws the ion saturation current, which, like the floating potential, is directly measured. A common rule of thumb for this voltage bias is 3/e times the expected electron temperature. Because the biased tip configuration is floating, the positive probe can draw at most an electron current only equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity to the ion saturation current drawn by the negative probe, given by :\nformula_45\nand as before the floating tip draws effectively no current:\nformula_46.\nAssuming that: \n1.) The electron energy distribution in the plasma is Maxwellian,\n2.) The mean free path of the electrons is greater than the ion sheath about the tips and larger than the probe radius, and\n3.) the probe sheath sizes are much smaller than the probe separation,\nthen the current to any probe can be considered composed of two parts\u00a0\u2013 the high energy tail of the Maxwellian electron distribution, and the ion saturation current:\nformula_47\nwhere the current \"Ie\" is thermal current. Specifically,\nformula_48,\nwhere \"S\" is surface area, \"Je\" is electron current density, and \"ne\" is electron density.\nAssuming that the ion and electron saturation current is the same for each probe, then the formulas for current to each of the probe tips take the form\nformula_49\nformula_50\nformula_51.\nIt is then simple to show\nformula_52\nbut the relations from above specifying that \"I+=-I\u2212\" and \"Ifl\"=0 give\nformula_53,\na transcendental equation in terms of applied and measured voltages and the unknown \"Te\" that in the limit \"qeVBias = qe(V+-V\u2212) \u00bb k Te\", becomes\nformula_54.\nThat is, the voltage difference between the positive and floating electrodes is proportional to the electron temperature. (This was especially important in the sixties and seventies before sophisticated data processing became widely available.)\nMore sophisticated analysis of triple probe data can take into account such factors as incomplete saturation, non-saturation, unequal areas.\nTriple probes have the advantage of simple biasing electronics (no sweeping required), simple data analysis, excellent time resolution, and insensitivity to potential fluctuations (whether imposed by an rf source or inherent fluctuations). Like double probes, they are sensitive to gradients in plasma parameters.\nSpecial arrangements.\nArrangements with four (tetra probe) or five (penta probe) have sometimes been used, but the advantage over triple probes has never been entirely convincing. The spacing between probes must be larger than the Debye length of the plasma to prevent an overlapping Debye sheath.\nA pin-plate probe consists of a small electrode directly in front of a large electrode, the idea being that the voltage sweep of the large probe can perturb the plasma potential at the sheath edge and thereby aggravate the difficulty of interpreting the \"I-V\" characteristic. The floating potential of the small electrode can be used to correct for changes in potential at the sheath edge of the large probe. Experimental results from this arrangement look promising, but experimental complexity and residual difficulties in the interpretation have prevented this configuration from becoming standard.\nVarious geometries have been proposed for use as ion temperature probes, for example, two cylindrical tips that rotate past each other in a magnetized plasma. Since shadowing effects depend on the ion Larmor radius, the results can be interpreted in terms of ion temperature. The ion temperature is an important quantity that is very difficult to measure. Unfortunately, it is also very difficult to analyze such probes in a fully self-consistent way.\nEmissive probes use an electrode heated either electrically or by the exposure to the plasma. When the electrode is biased more positive than the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are pulled back to the surface so the \"I\"-\"V\" characteristic is hardly changed. As soon as the electrode is biased negative with respect to the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are repelled and contribute a large negative current. The onset of this current or, more sensitively, the onset of a discrepancy between the characteristics of an unheated and a heated electrode, is a sensitive indicator of the plasma potential.\nTo measure fluctuations in plasma parameters, arrays of electrodes are used, usually one\u00a0\u2013 but occasionally two-dimensional. A typical array has a spacing of 1\u00a0mm and a total of 16 or 32 electrodes. A simpler arrangement to measure fluctuations is a negatively biased electrode flanked by two floating electrodes. The ion-saturation current is taken as a surrogate for the density and the floating potential as a surrogate for the plasma potential. This allows a rough measurement of the turbulent particle flux\nformula_55\nCylindrical Langmuir probe in electron flow.\nMost often, the Langmuir probe is a small sized electrode inserted into a plasma which is connected to an external circuit that measures the properties of the plasma with respect to ground. The ground is typically an electrode with a large surface area and is usually in contact with the same plasma (very often the metallic wall of the chamber). This allows the probe to measure the I-V characteristic of the plasma. The probe measures the characteristic current formula_56 of the plasma when the probe is biased with a potential formula_57.\nRelations between the probe I-V characteristic and parameters of isotropic plasma were found by Irving Langmuir and they can be derived most elementary for the planar probe of a large surface area formula_58 (ignoring the edge effects problem). Let us choose the point formula_59 in plasma at the distance formula_60 from the probe surface where electric field of the probe is negligible while each electron of plasma passing this point could reach the probe surface without collisions with plasma components: formula_61, formula_62 is the Debye length and formula_63 is the electron free path calculated for its total cross section with plasma components. In the vicinity of the point formula_59 we can imagine a small element of the surface area formula_65 parallel to the probe surface. The elementary current formula_66 of plasma electrons passing throughout formula_65 in a direction of the probe surface can be written in the form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_68 is a scalar of the electron thermal velocity vector formula_69,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nformula_70 is the element of the solid angle with its relative value formula_71, formula_72 is the angle between perpendicular to the probe surface recalled from the point formula_59 and the radius-vector of the electron thermal velocity formula_69 forming a spherical layer of thickness formula_75 in velocity space, and formula_76 is the electron distribution function normalized to unity\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTaking into account uniform conditions along the probe surface (boundaries are excluded), formula_77, we can take double integral with respect to the angle formula_78, and with respect to the velocity formula_79, from the expression (1), after substitution Eq. (2) in it, to calculate a total electron current on the probe\nwhereformula_57 is the probe potential with respect to the potential of plasma formula_81, formula_82 is the lowest electron velocity value at which the electron still could reach the probe surface charged to the potential formula_57, formula_84 is the upper limit of the angle formula_72 at which the electron having initial velocity formula_68 can still reach the probe surface with a zero-value of its velocity at this surface. That means the value formula_84 is defined by the condition\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDeriving the value formula_84 from Eq. (5) and substituting it in Eq. (4), we can obtain the probe I-V characteristic (neglecting the ion current) in the range of the probe potential formula_89 in the form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDifferentiating Eq. (6) twice with respect to the potential formula_57, one can find the expression describing the second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic (obtained firstly by M. J. Druyvestein \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\ndefining the electron distribution function over velocity formula_91 in the evident form. M. J. Druyvestein has shown in particular that Eqs. (6) and (7) are valid for description of operation of the probe of any arbitrary convex geometrical shape. \n Substituting the Maxwellian distribution function:\nwhere formula_92 is the most probable velocity, in Eq. (6) we obtain the expression\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFrom which the very useful in practice relation follows\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nallowing one to derive the electron energy formula_93 (for Maxwellian distribution function only!) by a slope of the probe I-V characteristic in a semilogarithmic scale. \nThus in plasmas with isotropic electron distributions, the electron current formula_94 on a surface formula_95 of the cylindrical Langmuir probe at plasma potential formula_81 is defined by the average electron thermal velocity formula_97 and can be written down as equation (see Eqs. (6), (9) at formula_81)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_99 is the electron concentration, formula_100 is the probe radius, and formula_101 is its length. \nIt is obvious that if plasma electrons form an electron wind (flow) across the cylindrical probe axis with a velocity formula_102, the expression\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nholds true. \nIn plasmas produced by gas-discharge arc sources as well as inductively coupled sources, the electron wind can develop the Mach number formula_103 . Here the parameter formula_104 is introduced along with the Mach number for simplification of mathematical expressions. Note that formula_105, whereformula_106 is the most probable velocity for the Maxwellian distribution function, so that formula_107 . Thus the general case where formula_108 is of the theoretical and practical interest. \nCorresponding physical and mathematical considerations presented in Refs. [9,10] has shown that at the Maxwellian distribution function of the electrons in a reference system moving with the velocity formula_109 across axis of the cylindrical probe set at plasma potential formula_81, the electron current on the probe can be written down in the form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nwhere formula_111 and formula_112 are Bessel functions of imaginary arguments and Eq. (13) is reduced to Eq. (11) atformula_113 being reduced to Eq. (12) at formula_114 . \nThe second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic formula_115 with respect to the probe potential formula_57 can be presented in this case in the form (see Fig. 3)\nwhere\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nand the electron energy formula_117 is expressed in eV.\nAll parameters of the electron population: formula_99, formula_119, formula_120 and formula_106 in plasma can be derived from the experimental probe I-V characteristic second derivative formula_115 by its least square best fitting with the theoretical curve expressed by Eq. (14). For detail and for problem of the general case of none-Maxwellian electron distribution functions see., \nPractical considerations.\nFor laboratory and technical plasmas, the electrodes are most commonly tungsten or tantalum wires several thousandths of an inch thick, because they have a high melting point but can be made small enough not to perturb the plasma. Although the melting point is somewhat lower, molybdenum is sometimes used because it is easier to machine and solder than tungsten. For fusion plasmas, graphite electrodes with dimensions from 1 to 10\u00a0mm are usually used because they can withstand the highest power loads (also sublimating at high temperatures rather than melting), and result in reduced bremsstrahlung radiation (with respect to metals) due to the low atomic number of carbon. The electrode surface exposed to the plasma must be defined, e.g. by insulating all but the tip of a wire electrode. If there can be significant deposition of conducting materials (metals or graphite), then the insulator should be separated from the electrode by a to prevent short-circuiting.\nIn a magnetized plasma, it appears to be best to choose a probe size a few times larger than the ion Larmor radius. A point of contention is whether it is better to use proud probes, where the angle between the magnetic field and the surface is at least 15\u00b0, or flush-mounted probes, which are embedded in the plasma-facing components and generally have an angle of 1 to 5 \u00b0. Many plasma physicists feel more comfortable with proud probes, which have a longer tradition and possibly are less perturbed by electron saturation effects, although this is disputed. Flush-mounted probes, on the other hand, being part of the wall, are less perturbative. Knowledge of the field angle is necessary with proud probes to determine the fluxes to the wall, whereas it is necessary with flush-mounted probes to determine the density.\nIn very hot and dense plasmas, as found in fusion research, it is often necessary to limit the thermal load to the probe by limiting the exposure time. A reciprocating probe is mounted on an arm that is moved into and back out of the plasma, usually in about one second by means of either a pneumatic drive or an electromagnetic drive using the ambient magnetic field. Pop-up probes are similar, but the electrodes rest behind a shield and are only moved the few millimeters necessary to bring them into the plasma near the wall.\nA Langmuir probe can be purchased off the shelf for on the order of 15,000 U.S. dollars, or they can be built by an experienced researcher or technician. When working at frequencies under 100\u00a0MHz, it is advisable to use blocking filters, and take necessary grounding precautions.\nIn low temperature plasmas, in which the probe does not get hot, surface contamination may become an issue. This effect can cause hysteresis in the I-V curve and may limit the current collected by the probe. A heating mechanism or a glow discharge plasma may be used to clean the probe and prevent misleading results.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1941, the first awards for feature-length documentaries were bestowed as Special Awards to \"Kukan\" and \"Target for Tonight\". They have since been bestowed competitively each year, with the exception of 1946. Copies of every winning film (along with copies of most nominees) are held by the Academy Film Archive.\nWinners and nominees.\nFollowing the Academy's practice, films are listed below by the award year (that is, the year they were released under the Academy's rules for eligibility). In practice, due to the limited nature of documentary distribution, a film may be released in different years in different venues, sometimes years after production is complete.\nShortlisted finalists.\nFinalists for Best Documentary Feature are selected by the Documentary Branch based on a preliminary ballot. A second preferential ballot determines the five nominees. Prior to the 78th Academy Awards, there were twelve films shortlisted.\nSuperlatives.\nFor this Academy Award category, the following superlatives emerge:\nArthur Cohn \u2013 3 awards \"(resulting from 4 nominations)\";\nSimon Chinn \u2013 2 awards;\nJacques-Yves Cousteau \u2013 2 awards;\nWalt Disney \u2013 2 awards \"(resulting from 7 nominations; Disney has an additional 2 wins in the Documentary Short Subject category)\";\nRob Epstein \u2013 2 awards;\nMarvin Hier \u2013 2 awards;\nBarbara Kopple \u2013 2 awards\nMark Jonathan Harris \u2013 2 awards\nProcess controversies.\nMichael Moore's \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", at the time the highest-grossing documentary film in movie history, was ruled ineligible because Moore had opted to have it played on television prior to the 2004 election. Previously, the 1982 winner \"Just Another Missing Kid\" had already been broadcast in Canada and won that country's ACTRA award for excellence in television at the time of its nomination.\nIn 1990, a group of 45 filmmakers filed a protest to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over a potential conflict of interest involving Mitchell Block. They noted that Block was a member of the Documentary Steering Committee, which selects films as nominees, but he had a conflict of interest because his company Direct Cinema owned the distribution rights to three of the five films (including eventual winner \"\") selected that year as nominees for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. They noted that Michael Moore's \"Roger &amp; Me\" (distributed by Warner Brothers) was omitted from the nominees, although it had been highly praised by numerous critics and was ranked by many critics as one of the top ten films of the year.\nThe controversy over \"Hoop Dreams\"' exclusion was enough to have the Academy Awards begin the process to change its documentary voting system. Roger Ebert, who had declared it to be the best 1994 movie of any kind, looked into its failure to receive a nomination: \"We learned, through very reliable sources, that the members of the committee had a system. They carried little flashlights. When one gave up on a film, he waved a light on the screen. When a majority of flashlights had voted, the film was switched off. \"Hoop Dreams\" was stopped after 15 minutes.\"\nThe Academy's executive director, Bruce Davis, took the unprecedented step of asking accounting firm Price Waterhouse to turn over the complete results of that year's voting, in which members of the committee had rated each of the 63 eligible documentaries on a scale of six to ten. \"What I found,\" said Davis, \"is that a small group of members gave zeros (actually low scores) to every single film except the five they wanted to see nominated. And they gave tens to those five, which completely skewed the voting. There was one film that received more scores of ten than any other, but it wasn't nominated. It also got zeros (low scores) from those few voters, and that was enough to push it to sixth place.\"\nIn 2000, Arthur Cohn, the producer of the winning \"One Day in September\" boasted \"I won this without showing it in a single theater!\" Cohn had hit upon the tactic of showing his Oscar entries at invitation-only screenings, and to as few other people as possible. Oscar bylaws at the time required voters to have seen all five nominated documentaries; by limiting his audience, Cohn shrank the voting pool and improved his odds. Following protests by many documentarians, the nominating system was subsequently changed.\n\"Hoop Dreams\" director Steve James said \"With so few people looking at any given film, it only takes one to dislike a film, and its chances for making the shortlist are diminished greatly. So they've got to do something, I think, to make the process more sane for deciding the shortlist.\" Among other rule changes taking effect in 2013, the academy began requiring a documentary to have been reviewed by either \"The New York Times\" or \"Los Angeles Times\", and be commercially released for at least one week in both of those cities. Advocating the rule change, Michael Moore said \"When people get the award for best documentary and they go on stage and thank the Academy, it's not really the Academy, is it? It's 5% of the Academy.\"\nThe awards process has also been criticized for emphasizing a documentary's subject matter over its style or quality. In 2009, \"Entertainment Weekly\"'s Owen Gleiberman wrote about the documentary branch members' penchant for choosing \"movies that the selection committee deemed good because they're good for you... a kind of self-defeating aesthetic of granola documentary correctness.\"\nIn 2014, following the announcement of the shortlist of eligible feature documentary nominees, Sony Pictures Classics co-president Tom Bernard publicly criticized Academy documentary voters after they excluded SPC's \"Red Army\" from the shortlist. \"It's a sign of some really old people in the documentary area of the Academy. There's a lot of people who are really up in their years. It's shocking to me that that film (\"Red Army\") didn't get in,\" Bernard said. Additionally, in his reporting of the Oscar documentary shortlist exclusions that year, \"The Hollywood Reporter\"'s Scott Feinberg reacted to \"Red Army\"'s omission: \"...no matter which 15 titles the doc branch selected, plenty of other great ones would be left on the outside. That is the case, most egregiously, with Gabe Polsky's \"Red Army\" (Sony Classics), a masterful look at the role of sports in society and Russian-American relations\". (\"Icarus\", another documentary related to sports and Russian-American relations, later won the Oscar.)\nIn 2017, following the win of the eight-hour \"O.J.: Made in America\" in this category, the Academy announced that multi-part and limited series would be ineligible for the award in the future, even if they are not broadcast after their Oscar-qualifying release (as was \"O.J.: Made in America\").\nVarious other acclaimed documentaries have not been nominated such as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDocumentaries with wins or nominations in other categories.\nThough Academy rules do not expressly preclude documentaries from being nominated in other competitive categories, documentaries are typically considered ineligible for nominations in categories that presume the work is fictitious, including Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and acting. To date, no documentaries have been nominated for Best Picture, or Best Director. \"The Quiet One\" was nominated for Best Story and Screenplay.\nNo documentary feature has yet been nominated for Best Picture, although \"Chang\" was nominated in the \"Unique and Artistic Production\" category at the 1927/28 awards.\nAt the 3rd Academy Awards, prior to the introduction of a documentary category, \"With Byrd at the South Pole\" won the award for Best Cinematography, becoming the first documentary both to be nominated for and win an Oscar. 1952's \"Navajo\" would become the first film nominated for both Best Documentary and Best Cinematography.\n\"Woodstock\" was the first documentary to be nominated for Best Film Editing while \"Hoop Dreams\" was the second (although it was, controversially, not nominated for Best Documentary Feature). \"Woodstock\" is also the only documentary to receive a nomination for Best Sound.\n\"Honeyland\" became the first documentary to be nominated for both Best International Feature Film and Best Documentary Feature. The following year, \"Collective\" would accomplish the same double nomination. Prior to this, \"Waltz with Bashir\" became the first documentary and first animated film nominated for Best International Feature Film, although it was not nominated for Best Documentary Feature. The Danish-language animated documentary \"Flee\" was later nominated for Best International Feature, Best Documentary Feature, and Best Animated Feature, the first film to accomplish this feat.\nNine documentaries have received nominations for Best Original Song: \"Mondo Cane\" (for Riz Ortolani and Nino Oliviero's \"More\"), \"An Inconvenient Truth\" (for Melissa Etheridge's \"I Need to Wake Up\", the only nominee from a documentary to win), \"Chasing Ice\" (for J. Ralph's \"Before My Time\"), \"Racing Extinction\" (for Ralph and Anhoni's \"Manta Ray\"), ' (for Ralph and Sting's \"The Empty Chair\"), ' (for Glen Campbell and Julian Raymond's \"I'm Not Gonna Miss You\"), \"The Hunting Ground\" (for Lady Gaga and Diane Warren's \"Til It Happens To You\"), \"RBG\" (for Warren's \"I'll Fight\") and 'American Symphony' (for Batiste's \"It Never Went Away\").\nDocumentaries nominated for their scores include \"This is Cinerama\", \"White Wilderness\" (which also won for Documentary Feature), \"Let It Be\", and \"Birds Do It, Bees Do It\".\nFive documentary filmmakers have received honorary Oscars: Pete Smith, William L. Hendricks, D. A. Pennebaker, Frederick Wiseman, and Agn\u00e8s Varda.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62392", "revid": "1315982668", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62392", "title": "Location-based service", "text": "General class of computer program-level services that use location data to control systems\nLocation-based service (LBS) is a general term denoting software services which use geographic data and information to search systems, in turn providing services or information to users. LBS can be used in a variety of contexts, such as health, indoor object search, entertainment, work, personal life, etc. Commonly used examples of location-based services include navigation software, social networking services, location-based advertising, and a tracking system. LBS can also include mobile commerce when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location. LBS also includes personalized weather services and even location-based games.\nLBS is critical to many businesses as well as government organizations to drive real insight from data tied to a specific location where activities take place. The spatial patterns that vehicle location data and services can provide is one of its most powerful and useful aspects where location is a common denominator in all of these activities and can be leveraged to better understand patterns and relationships. Banking, surveillance, online commerce, and many weapon systems are dependent on LBS.\nAccess policies are controlled by location data or time-of-day constraints, or a combination thereof. As such, an LBS is an information service and has a number of uses in social networking today as information, in entertainment or security, which is accessible with mobile devices through the mobile network and which uses information on the geographical position of the mobile device.\nThis concept of location-based systems is not compliant with the standardized concept of real-time locating systems (RTLS) and related local services, as noted in ISO/IEC 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1. While networked computing devices generally do very well to inform consumers of days old data, the computing devices themselves can also be tracked, even in real-time. LBS privacy issues arise in that context, and are documented below.\nHistory.\nLocation-based services (LBSs) are widely used in many computer systems and applications. Modern location-based services are made possible by technological developments such as the World Wide Web, satellite navigation systems, and the widespread use of mobile phones.\nLocation-based services were developed by integrating data from satellite navigation systems, cellular networks, and mobile computing, to provide services based on the geographical locations of users. Over their history, location-based software has evolved from simple synchronization-based service models to authenticated and complex tools for implementing virtually any location-based service model or facility.\nThere is currently no agreed upon criteria for defining the market size of location-based services, but the European GNSS Agency estimated that 40% of all computer applications used location-based software as of 2013, and 30% of all Internet searches were for locations.\nLBS is the ability to open and close specific data objects based on the use of location or time (or both) as controls and triggers or as part of complex cryptographic key or hashing systems and the data they provide access to. Location-based services may be one of the most heavily used application-layer decision framework in computing.\nThe Global Positioning System was first developed by the United States Department of Defense in the 1970s, and was made available for worldwide use and use by civilians in the 1980s. Research forerunners of today's location-based services include the infrared Active Badge system (1989\u20131993), the Ericsson-Europolitan GSM LBS trial by J\u00f6rgen Johansson (1995), and the master thesis written by Nokia employee Timo Rantalainen in 1995.\nIn 1990 International Teletrac Systems (later PacTel Teletrac), founded in Los Angeles CA, introduced the world's first dynamic real-time stolen vehicle recovery services. As an adjacency to this they began developing location-based services that could transmit information about location-based goods and services to custom-programmed alphanumeric Motorola pagers. In 1996 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules requiring all US mobile operators to locate emergency callers. This rule was a compromise resulting from US mobile operators seeking the support of the emergency community in order to obtain the same protection from lawsuits relating to emergency calls as fixed-line operators already had.\nIn 1997 Christopher Kingdon, of Ericsson, handed in the Location Services (LCS) stage 1 description to the joint GSM group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). As a result, the LCS sub-working group was created under ANSI T1P1.5. This group went on to select positioning methods and standardize Location Services (LCS), later known as Location Based Services (LBS). Nodes defined include the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC), the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) and concepts such as Mobile Originating Location Request (MO-LR), Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) and Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR).\nAs a result of these efforts in 1999 the first digital location-based service patent was filed in the US and ultimately issued after nine office actions in March 2002. The patent has controls which when applied to today's networking models provide key value in all systems.\nIn 2000, after approval from the world\u2019s twelve largest telecom operators, Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia jointly formed and launched the Location Interoperability Forum Ltd (LIF). This forum first specified the Mobile Location Protocol (MLP), an interface between the telecom network and an LBS application running on a server in the Internet domain. Then, much driven by the Vodafone group, LIF went on to specify the Location Enabling Server (LES), a \"middleware\", which simplifies the integration of multiple LBS with an operators infrastructure. In 2004 LIF was merged with the Open Mobile Association (OMA). An LBS work group was formed within the OMA.\nIn 2002, Marex.com in Miami Florida designed the world first marine asset telemetry device for commercial sale. The device, designed by Marex and engineered by its partner firms in telecom and hardware, was capable of transmitting location data and retrieving location-based service data via both cellular and satellite-based communications channels. Utilizing the Orbcomm satellite network, the device had multi level SOS features for both MAYDAY and marine assistance, vessel system condition and performance monitoring with remote notification, and a dedicated hardware device similar to a GPS tracking unit. Based upon the device location, it was capable of providing detailed bearing, distance and communication information to the vessel operator in real time, in addition to the marine assistance and MAYDAY features. The concept and functionality was coined \"Location Based Services\" by the principal architect and product manager for Marex, Jason Manowitz, SVP, Product and Strategy. The device was branded as \"Integrated Marine Asset Management System\" (\"IMAMS\"), and the proof-of-concept beta device was demonstrated to various US government agencies for vessel identification, tracking, and enforcement operations in addition to the commercial product line. The device was capable of tracking assets including ships, planes, shipping containers, or any other mobile asset with a proper power source and antenna placement. Marex's financial challenges were unable to support product introduction and the beta device disappeared.\nThe first consumer LBS-capable mobile Web device was the Palm VII, released in 1999. Two of the in-the-box applications made use of the ZIP-code\u2013level positioning information and share the title for first consumer LBS application: the Weather.com app from The Weather Channel, and the TrafficTouch app from Sony-Etak / Metro Traffic.\nThe first LBS services were launched during 2001 by TeliaSonera in Sweden (FriendFinder, yellow pages, houseposition, emergency call location etc.) and by EMT in Estonia (emergency call location, friend finder, TV game). TeliaSonera and EMT based their services on the Ericsson Mobile Positioning System (MPS).\nOther early LBSs include friendzone, launched by swisscom in Switzerland in May 2001, using the technology of valis ltd. The service included friend finder, LBS dating and LBS games. The same service was launched later by Vodafone Germany, Orange Portugal and Pelephone in Israel. Microsoft's Wi-Fi-based indoor location system RADAR (2000), MIT's Cricket project using ultrasound location (2000) and Intel's Place Lab with wide-area location (2003).\nIn May 2002, go2 and AT&amp;T Mobility launched the first (US) mobile LBS local search application that used Automatic Location Identification (ALI) technologies mandated by the FCC. go2 users were able to use AT&amp;T's ALI to determine their location and search near that location to obtain a list of requested locations (stores, restaurants, etc.) ranked by proximity to the ALI provide by the AT&amp;T wireless network. The ALI determined location was also used as a starting point for turn-by-turn directions.\nThe main advantage is that mobile users do not have to manually specify postal codes or other location identifiers to use LBS, when they roam into a different location.\nLocation industry.\nThere are various companies that sell access to an individual's location history and this is estimated to be a $12 billion industry composed of collectors, aggregators and marketplaces. As of 2021, a company named Near claimed to have data from 1.6 billion people in 44 different countries, Mobilewalla claims data on 1.9 billion devices, and X-Mode claims to have a database of 25 percent of the U.S. adult population. An analysis, conducted by the non-profit newsroom called The Markup, found six out of 47 companies who claimed over a billion devices in their database. As of 2021, there are no rules or laws governing who can buy an individual's data.\nApplications.\nLocation-based services are used in a wide range of applications, spanning consumer, commercial, and public safety sectors.\nNavigation and information services.\nThe most common application of LBS is in navigation and local search.\nCommercial and enterprise.\nLBS is used in telematics, fleet digitalization, and modern logistics.\nSocial networking.\nMany social media platforms have integrated LBS to enable geosocial networking features. These allow users to \"check in\" at locations, share their location with friends, or discover events happening nearby.\nEntertainment.\nLBS is a component of location-based games, where a player's real-world location is a part of the gameplay. A prominent example of this is \"Pok\u00e9mon Go\".\nLocating methods.\nThere are a number of ways in which the location of an object, such as a mobile phone or device, can be determined. Another emerging method for confirming location is IoT and blockchain-based relative object location verification.\nControl plane locating.\nWith control plane locating, sometimes referred to as positioning, the mobile phone service provider gets the location based on the radio signal delay of the closest cell-phone towers (for phones without satellite navigation features) which can be quite slow as it uses the 'voice control' channel. In the UK, networks do not use trilateration; Because LBS services use a single base station, with a \"radius\" of inaccuracy, to determine a phone's location. This technique was the basis of the E-911 mandate and is still used to locate cellphones as a safety measure. Newer phones and PDAs typically have an integrated A-GPS chip.\nIn addition there are emerging techniques like Real Time Kinematics and WiFi RTT (Round Trip Timing) as part of Precision Time Management services in WiFi and related protocols.\nIn order to provide a successful LBS technology the following factors must be met:\nSeveral categories of methods can be used to find the location of the subscriber. The simple and standard solution is LBS based on a satellite navigation system such as Galileo or GPS. Sony Ericsson's \"NearMe\" is one such example; it is used to maintain knowledge of the exact location. Satellite navigation is based on the concept of trilateration, a basic geometric principle that allows finding one location if one knows its distance from other, already known locations.\nSelf-reported positioning.\nA low cost alternative to using location technology to track the player, is to not track at all. This has been referred to as \"self-reported positioning\". It was used in the mixed reality game called Uncle Roy All Around You in 2003 and considered for use in the Augmented reality games in 2006. Instead of tracking technologies, players were given a map which they could pan around and subsequently mark their location upon. With the rise of location-based networking, this is more commonly known as a user \"check-in\".\nOther.\nNear LBS (NLBS) involves local-range technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, wireless LAN, infrared or near-field communication technologies, which are used to match devices to nearby services. This application allows a person to access information based on their surroundings; especially suitable for using inside closed premises, restricted or regional area.\nAnother alternative is an operator- and satellite-independent location service based on access into the deep level telecoms network (SS7). This solution enables accurate and quick determination of geographical coordinates of mobile phones by providing operator-independent location data and works also for handsets that do not have satellite navigation capability.\nIn addition, the IP address could provide the end-user's location.\nMany other local positioning systems and indoor positioning systems are available, especially for indoor use. GPS and GSM do not work very well indoors, so other techniques are used, including co-pilot beacon for CDMA networks, Bluetooth, UWB, RFID and Wi-Fi.\nPrivacy issues.\nThe Location Privacy Protection Act of 2012 (S.1223) was introduced by Senator Al Franken (D-MN) in order to regulate the transmission and sharing of user location data in the United States. It is based on the individual's one time consent to participate in these services (Opt In). The bill specifies the collecting entities, the collectable data and its usage. The bill does not specify, however, the period of time that the data collecting entity can hold on to the user data (a limit of 24 hours seems appropriate since most of the services use the data for immediate searches, communications, etc.), and the bill does not include location data stored locally on the device (the user should be able to delete the contents of the location data document periodically just as he would delete a log document). The bill which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would also require mobile services to disclose the names of the advertising networks or other third parties with which they share consumers' locations.\nWith the passing of the CAN-SPAM Act in 2003, it became illegal in the United States to send any message to the end user without the end user specifically opting-in. This put an additional challenge on LBS applications as far as \"carrier-centric\" services were concerned. As a result, there has been a focus on user-centric location-based services and applications which give the user control of the experience, typically by opting in first via a website or mobile interface (such as SMS, mobile Web, and Java/BREW applications).\nThe European Union also provides a legal framework for data protection that may be applied for location-based services, and more particularly several European directives such as: (1) Personal data: Directive 95/46/EC; (2) Personal data in electronic communications: Directive 2002/58/EC; (3) Data Retention: Directive 2006/24/EC. However the applicability of legal provisions to varying forms of LBS and of processing location data is unclear.\nOne implication of this technology is that data about a subscriber's location and historical movements is owned and controlled by the network operators, including mobile carriers and mobile content providers. Mobile content providers and app developers are a concern. Indeed, a 2013 MIT study by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity. A critical article by Dobson and Fisher discusses the possibilities for misuse of location information.\nBeside the legal framework there exist several technical approaches to protect privacy using privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Such PETs range from simplistic on/off switches to sophisticated PETs using anonymization techniques (e.g. providing k-anonymity), or cryptographic protocols. Only few LBS offer such PETs, e.g., Google Latitude offered an on/off switch and allows to stick one's position to a free definable location. Additionally, it is an open question how users perceive and trust in different PETs. The only study that addresses user perception of state of the art PETs is. Another set of techniques included in the PETs are the location obfuscation techniques, which slightly alter the location of the users in order to hide their real location while still being able to represent their position and receive services from their LBS provider.\nRecent research has shown that crowdsourcing is also an effective approach at locating lost objects while still upholding the privacy of users. This is done by ensuring a limited level of interactions between users.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is run over the worldwide classic distance of . Colts and geldings carry a weight of ; fillies carry . The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, The Test of Champions and The Run for the Carnations, is the traditional third and final leg of the Triple Crown. It is usually held on the first or second Saturday in June, five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes. The 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown winner Secretariat holds the track record (which is also a world record on dirt) of 2:24.\nThe race covers one full lap of Belmont Park, known as \"The Championship Track\" because nearly every major American champion in racing history has competed on the racetrack. Belmont Park, with its large, wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks in America. Despite the distance, the race tends to favor horses with tactical speed: relatively few winners close from far behind the early leaders.\nThe attendance at the Belmont Stakes is among the American thoroughbred racing top-attended events. The 2004 Belmont Stakes drew a television audience of 21.9 million viewers, and had the highest household viewing rate since 1977 when Seattle Slew won the Triple Crown.\nThe 157th running of the Belmont Stakes was on Saturday, June 7, 2025, at Saratoga Race Course. The 2026 edition of the race will also be held at Saratoga Race Course as the reconstruction of Belmont Park will not be completely finished.\nHistory.\n1867\u20131929: Early years.\nThe first Belmont Stakes was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx, built in 1866 by stock market speculator Leonard Jerome (1817\u20131891) and financed by August Belmont Sr. (1816\u20131890), for whom the race was named. The first race in 1867 saw the filly Ruthless win, while the following year was won by General Duke. The first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. The race continued to be held at Jerome Park until 1890, when it was moved to the nearby facility, Morris Park Racecourse. The 1895 race was almost not held because of new laws that banned bookmaking in New York: it was eventually rescheduled for November 2. The race remained at Morris Park Racecourse until the May 1905 opening of the new Belmont Park, racetrack in Elmont, New York, on Long Island, just outside the New York City borough of Queens. When anti-gambling legislation was passed in New York State, Belmont Racetrack was closed, and the race was cancelled in 1911 and 1912.\nThe first winner of the Triple Crown was Sir Barton, in 1919, before the series was recognized as such. In 1920, the Belmont was won by the great Man o' War, who won by 20 lengths, setting a new stakes and American record, while under a stout pull.\nStarting in 1926, the winner of the Belmont Stakes has been presented with August Belmont Trophy. The owner may keep the trophy for one year, and also receives a silver miniature for permanent use.\n1930\u20132000: Evolution of the Triple Crown series.\nThe term Triple Crown was first used when Gallant Fox won the three races in 1930, but the term did not enter widespread use until 1935 when his son Omaha repeated the feat. Sir Barton was then honored retroactively. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes. The date of each event is now set by the Kentucky Derby, which is always held on the first Saturday in May. The Preakness Stakes is currently held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held three weeks after the Preakness (five weeks after the Derby). The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the latest is May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is thus June 5, and the latest is June 11. In 2020, due to the cancellation of the original dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the order changed with the Belmont first on June 20, the Kentucky Derby on September 5 and the Preakness on October 3\u2014all with no spectators\u2014before the Triple Crown races resumed their normal schedule in 2021.\nIn 1937, War Admiral became the fourth Triple Crown winner after winning the Belmont in a new track record time of 2:28 3/5. In the 1940s, four Triple Crown winners followed: Whirlaway in 1941, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946 and Citation in 1948. Count Fleet won the race by a then-record margin of twenty-five lengths. He also set a stakes record of 2:28 1/5, a record tied by Citation. In 1957, the stakes record was smashed when Gallant Man ran the Belmont in 2:26 3/5 in a year when the Triple Crown series was split three ways.\nThe Belmont Stakes race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963 to 1967, while the track at Belmont was restored and renovated.\nThe largest crowd of the 20th century was in 1971 with over 80,000 people, supplemented by the city's Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero, Ca\u00f1onero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was poised to win the U.S. Triple Crown. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Ca\u00f1onero II failed to win the Triple Crown when he struggled across the finish line in 4th place behind Pass Catcher, ridden by Walter Blum. Despite this loss, Ca\u00f1onero II was named the winner of the first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.\nOn June 9, 1973, Secretariat won the Belmont Stakes by thirty-one lengths in a record time of 2:24, becoming a Triple Crown champion, ending a 25-year gap between Citation, the Belmont and Triple Crown winner in 1948. Secretariat's record still stands as the fastest running of the Belmont Stakes and an American record for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles on the dirt. In 1977, Seattle Slew became the first horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated. Affirmed was the last winner of the Triple Crown in the 20th century, taking the Belmont Stakes in 2:26 4/5 on June 10, 1978. Ridden by eighteen-year-old Steve Cauthen, Affirmed defeated rival Alydar with Jorge Vel\u00e1squez in the saddle. At the time the race was the third-slowest start and the third-fastest finish with the quarter in 25, the half in 50, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5.\nIn 1988, Secretariat's son Risen Star won the Belmont in 2:26 2/5, then the second-fastest time in the history of the race. The next year, Easy Goer lowered the mark for second-fastest time to 2:26. Easy Goer also holds a Beyer Speed Figure of 122 for the race, the best of any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987.\n2001\u2013present: Recent years.\nFor three years in a row, horses came to the Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown on the line only to fail. In 2002, Belmont Park hosted what was then the largest crowd in its history when 103,222 saw War Emblem lose to longshot Sarava after stumbling at the start. In 2003, 101,864 watched Funny Cide finish third behind Empire Maker. In 2004, the attendance record was shattered when 120,139 people saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone.\nIn 2007, Rags to Riches became the first filly to win the race since Tanya in 1905. Three more failed Triple Crown bids followed: in 2008, Big Brown lost to Da' Tara; in 2012, I'll Have Another was withdrawn due to injury; and in 2014, California Chrome was beaten by Tonalist. This fueled debate about whether the series needed to be changed, for example by lengthening the period between races.\nAmerican Pharoah won the 2015 race, becoming the 12th horse in history to win the Triple Crown and the first in 37 years. The crowd that year was limited for the first time, to 90,000. His time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont Stakes history, and the second-fastest time for a Triple Crown winner. In 2018, Justify became the 13th Triple Crown winner and only the second horse to do so while undefeated.\nJustify won the 150th Belmont Stakes in 2018 to become the 13th Triple Crown champion.\nThe 152nd running of the Belmont Stakes took place without in-person fans on June 20, 2020, delayed from June 6 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading to the announcement, NYRA considered various dates after evaluating the spring-summer meeting at Belmont Park and after the other three majors set their respective dates: the Kentucky Derby moving to September 5, the Preakness Stakes moving to October 3, and the Breeders' Cup Classic slated for November 7. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced on May 16 that horse racing tracks statewide, including Belmont Park, would be permitted to resume races without in-person fans on June 1. The 2020 contest also marked the first time in history that the Belmont Stakes served as the Triple Crown's opening leg, with its running length shortened accordingly to , its shortest distance since 1894.\nTemporary move to Saratoga.\nThe New York Racing Association held both the 2024 Belmont Stakes and the 2025 Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Race Course because of ongoing construction and renovations at Belmont Park. The purse of the race was increased to US$2 million with the winner receiving $1,200,000. It was run at a shorter distance of instead of the usual due to the smaller size of the Saratoga dirt track.\nOn June 13, 2025, it was announced that the 2026 Belmont Stakes would also be held at Saratoga Race Course.\nLocations.\nOver the years the race has been held at the following racetracks:\nDistance and race details.\nThe purse for the first running in 1867 was $1,500 added, meaning the purse was supplemented by nomination and entry fees. This made the total purse $2,500, with the winner receiving $1,850. The purse increased sharply in the Roaring Twenties, from Man O'War's earnings of $7,950 in 1920 to Gallant Fox's take of $66,040 in 1930. Purses declined as a result of the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover. Throughout the sixties and early seventies, the value to the winner was roughly $100,000, depending on the added money generated by entry fees (larger fields thus leading to higher prize money). The purse was repeatedly raised in the eighties and nineties, reaching $500,000 added, with the winner receiving roughly $400,000. In 1998, the purse was changed to $1,000,000 guaranteed, with the winner receiving $600,000. In 2014, the purse was raised to $1,500,000.\nWith one exception, the race has been run at a level weight of 126 pounds (with a 5-pound allowance for fillies) since 1900. The 126 pounds comes from the English Classics, where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds. Races run prior to 1900 had varied weight conditions.\nThe first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction.\nTraditions.\nThe Belmont Stakes is traditionally called \"The Test of the Champion\" because it is by far the longest of the Triple Crown races (1.5 miles\u2013a full lap around the enormous Belmont main track). It is also one of the longest first-class races on dirt in the United States. Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the stamina, to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.\nIt is also known as \"The Run for the Carnations\" because the winning horse is draped with a blanket of white carnations after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of roses and black-eyed Susans for the Derby and Preakness, respectively.\nTrophy.\nThe winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner's trophy, designed by Paulding Farnham for Tiffany and Co. It was first presented to August Belmont Jr. in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.\nOfficial song.\nDespite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. Until 1996, the post parade song was \"The Sidewalks of New York\". From 1997 to 2009, the song was changed to a recording by Frank Sinatra of the \"Theme from \"New York, New York\"\" in an attempt to appeal to younger fans. In 2010, the song was changed to Jay-Z's \"Empire State of Mind\" sung by Jasmine V before reverting to \"Theme from \"New York, New York\"\" from 2011 through the present. This tradition is similar to the singing of the state song at the post parades of the first two Triple Crown races: \"My Old Kentucky Home\" at the Kentucky Derby and \"Maryland, My Maryland\" at the Preakness Stakes. The change of song gave rise to \"the myth of Mamie O'Rourke\", a reference to a character in the lyrics of \"The Sidewalks of New York.\" Before American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, some claimed that changing the official Belmont song \"cursed\" the Triple Crown and was why no horse had won since Affirmed in 1978. Others note that there was no Triple Crown winner between 1979 and 1996, even though \"Sidewalks\" was still played.\nOfficial drink.\nAlong with the change of song in 1997, the official drink was also changed, from the \"White Carnation\" to the \"Belmont Breeze.\" \"The New York Times\" reviewed both cocktails unfavorably, calling the Belmont Breeze \"a significant improvement over the nigh undrinkable White Carnation\" despite the fact that it \"tastes like a refined trashcan punch\". In 2011, the Belmont Breeze was again changed to the current official drink known as the \"Belmont Jewel.\"\nWhile the origin of the white carnation as the official flower of the Belmont Stakes is unknown, traditionally, pure white carnations stand for love and luck. It takes approximately 700 \"select\" carnations imported from Colombia to create the 40-pound blanket draped over the winner of the Belmont Stakes. The NYRA has long used The Pennock Company, a wholesale florist based in Philadelphia to import the carnations used for the mantle.\nRecords.\nSpeed record:\nBiggest Margin of Victory:\nMost wins by a jockey:\nMost wins by a trainer:\nMost wins by an owner:\nFillies in the Belmont.\nOnly 24 fillies have run in the Belmont; three of which have won:\nThis gives them a respectable 13% win rate when entered. For context, three fillies have won the Kentucky Derby while six have won the Preakness Stakes. On average, fillies have won between 2% and 3% of the Triple Crown races, with similar numbers for geldings; while about 95% of these races have been won by colts. The last filly as of June 11, 2022 to run in the Belmont was in 2022 when Nest ran second (placed) behind the winner her stable mate Mo Donegal.\nWinners (since 1867).\nTriple Crown winners are in bold.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nA \u2020 designates a filly.\nSire lines.\nWinners of the Belmont Stakes can be connected to each other due to the practice of arranging horse breeding based on their previous success.

The race currently covers at Churchill Downs; the horses carry . The Kentucky Oaks is held on the Friday before the Kentucky Derby each year. The winner gets $846,300 of the $1,500,000 purse, and a large garland blanket of lilies, resulting in the nickname \"Lilies for the Fillies.\" A silver Kentucky Oaks Trophy is presented to the winner.\nHistory.\nThe first running of the Kentucky Oaks was on May 19, 1875, when Churchill Downs was known as the Louisville Jockey Club. The race was founded by Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. along with the Kentucky Derby, the Clark Handicap, and the Falls City Handicap.\nThe Kentucky Oaks and the Kentucky Derby are the oldest continuously contested sporting events in American history. The Kentucky Oaks was modeled after the British Epsom Oaks, which has been run annually at Epsom Downs, Epsom, in Surrey since 1779. In the first race, the horse Vinaigrette won the then mile race in a time of 2:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;39+3\u20444, winning a purse of $1,175. Since that race, the Kentucky Oaks has been held each year.\nIn 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kentucky Oaks was rescheduled from May 1 to September 4.\nThe Kentucky Oaks is considered by some to be among the most popular horse races in American horse-racing society due to its high attendance. It has attracted about 100,000 people in attendance each year since 2001's 127th running of the Kentucky Oaks. In 1980, attendance reached about 50,000 people and by 1989, it had increased to about 67,000. The attendance at the Kentucky Oaks ranks third in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes and the Breeders' Cup. The attendance of the Kentucky Oaks typically trails only the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes; for more information see American thoroughbred racing top attended events.\nThe Kentucky Oaks, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and the Acorn Stakes are the counterparts to the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, held at Churchill Downs, Pimlico Race Course and Belmont Park, respectively. The \"Filly Triple Crown\", known as the Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing, is a series of three races at the Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) has considered changing the Triple Tiara series to the three counterparts of the Triple Crown.\nIn July 2025, Churchill Downs announced that the 2026 Kentucky Oaks would be held later in the evening and televised by NBC in prime time, moving from USA Network; Churchill Downs Inc. CEO Bill Carstanjen stated that a broadcast television airing in prime time would help increase the \"national profile\" of the Oaks, amid the 2025 Kentucky Derby achieving the race's largest television audience since 1989. The later post time has faced criticism from local restaurants, who believed that it could reduce traffic from attendees who scheduled dinner reservations after the Oaks.\nCharitable initiatives.\nSince 2008, Oaks Day has been used to highlight awareness for breast and ovarian cancer; the tradition was established by then-Kentucky governor Steve Beshear at the suggestion of Monika Clark, a patient of metastatic breast cancer whose husband was a law partner of Beshear. Attendees are encouraged to wear pink, while the \"Survivors Parade\" features nominated survivors of breast and ovarian cancer walking the track Churchill Downs partnered with the breast cancer charity Susan G. Komen for the Cure from 2009 through 2011, incorporating charity appeals into Oaks Day and donating a dollar for each spectator in attendance. In March 2012, Churchill Downs announced that it would instead partner with Stand Up to Cancer for that year's race, citing its wider scope.\nAwards for winners.\nBesides the silver Kentucky Oaks Trophy presented to the winner, they are also presented with a Garland of Lilies draped around the filly's withers.\nThe first garland for the Kentucky Oaks was presented to Kathleen, the 1916 winner. It was made of roses, not the lilies that have become synonymous with the filly's race today. Though every Oaks winner since Kathleen has received a garland, the Star Gazer Lily did not become the official flower of the Kentucky Oaks until 1991, when the Kroger Company was commissioned to create a feminine garland for the fillies. Lite Light, winner of the 117th Kentucky Oaks, was the first filly to receive the garland of lilies.\nThe Star Gazer Lily was selected for its femininity and strength. A total of 133 lilies are sewn onto a white moire fabric backing with a fleur-de-lis pattern, which, like the green satin of the Derby garland, is embroidered in white-on-white with the seal of the Commonwealth of Kentucky at one end and an image of the Twin Spires and the words stating which running of the Kentucky Oaks it is on the opposite end. It is trimmed in a border of Oak Ivy Leaves symbolic of the event. The completed fabric is 116 inches long, 18 inches wide and weighs approximately 18 pounds. A bouquet of Star Gazer Lilies is also given to the jockey for the winner's circle photo. Kroger is the official florist of the Kentucky Oaks and Derby. The public can view the lily garland at a local Kroger store the evening before the race.\nChanges in distance.\nThe Kentucky Oaks has been run at four different distances:\nRecords.\nOnly brothers to both win the Kentucky Oaks.\nCarl used the original German spelling of \"Goose\", which one of a few spellings was \"Ganz\", but also Gantz, Gans, and so on.\nThe Goose brothers are cousins of Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr., the founder of the Louisville Jockey Club.\n\"Oaks/Derby Double\".\nJockeys, trainers, and owners competing in the Kentucky Oaks often will compete in the Kentucky Derby, a race for the next day the Oaks.

{"id": "62400", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62400", "title": "Secretariat (horse)", "text": "1973 US Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing winner\nSecretariat (March 30, 1970 \u2013 October 4, 1989), also known as Big Red, was a champion American thoroughbred racehorse who was the ninth winner of the American Triple Crown, setting and still holding the fastest time record in all three of its constituent races. He became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and his record-breaking victory in the Belmont Stakes, which he won by 31 lengths, is often considered the greatest race ever run by a thoroughbred racehorse. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. Widely regarded as one of the greatest racehorses of all time, he was nominated to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. In the \"Blood-Horse\" magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat was second to Man o' War.\nAt age two, Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories. His only loss during this period was in the Champagne Stakes, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference. He received the Eclipse Award for champion two-year-old colt, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young.\nAt age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, but he also set speed records in all three races. His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20444 miles, and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles on the dirt. In 2012, his actual time of 1:53 in the Preakness Stakes was recognized as a stakes record after an official review.\nSecretariat's win in the Gotham Stakes tied the track record for 1 mile, he set a world record in the Marlboro Cup at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20448 miles and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on turf. He lost three times that year: in the Wood Memorial, Whitney, and Woodward Stakes, but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon. He won his second Horse of the Year title, plus Eclipse Awards for champion three-year-old colt and champion turf horse.\nAt the beginning of his three-year-old year, Secretariat was syndicated for a record-breaking $6.08 million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024), on the condition that he be retired from racing by the end of the year. Although he sired several successful racehorses, he ultimately was most influential through his daughters' offspring, becoming the leading broodmare sire in North America in 1992. His daughters produced several notable sires, including Storm Cat, A.P. Indy, Gone West, Dehere, Summer Squall, and Chief's Crown, and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions. Secretariat died in 1989 as a result of laminitis at age 19.\nBackground.\nSecretariat was officially bred by Christopher Chenery's Meadow Stud, but the breeding was actually arranged by Penny Chenery (then known as Penny Tweedy), who had taken over the running of the stable in 1968 when her father became ill. Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and his dam was Somethingroyal, a daughter of Princequillo. Bold Ruler was the leading sire in North America from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973. Owned by the Phipps family, Bold Ruler possessed both speed and stamina, having won the Preakness Stakes and Horse of the Year honors in 1957, and American Champion Sprint Horse honors in 1958. Bold Ruler was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm, but the Phipps family owned most of the mares to which Bold Ruler was bred, and few of his offspring were sold at public auction.\nTo bring new blood into their breeding program, the Phipps family sometimes negotiated a foal-sharing agreement with other mare owners: Instead of charging a stud fee for Bold Ruler, they would arrange for multiple matings with Bold Ruler, either with two mares in one year or one mare over a two-year period. Assuming two foals were produced, the Phipps family would keep one and the mare's owner would keep the other, with a coin toss determining who received first pick.\nUnder such an arrangement, Chenery sent two mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She then sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing agreement stated that the winner of the coin toss would get first pick of the foals produced in 1969, while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a colt and filly were produced. In the 1969 breeding season, Cicada did not conceive, leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970. Thus, the winner of the coin toss would get only one foal (the first pick from 1969), and the loser would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970). Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss, which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, with Arthur \"Bull\" Hancock of Claiborne Farm as witness. Ogden Phipps won the toss and took the 1969 weanling filly out of Somethingroyal. The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, though she did later become a stakes producer. Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as-yet-unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, which turned out to be Secretariat.\nEarly years.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n'A foal is born at midnightAnd in the frosty mornThe horseman eyes him fondly,And a secret hope is born.But breathe it not, nor whisperFor fear of a neighbor's scorn.He's a chestnut colt, and he's got a star.He may be another Man o' War.Nay, say it aloud\u2014be shameless.Dream and hope and yearn,For there's never a man among youBut waits for his return.\n\u2014\"from \"Big Red\"\", by J.A. Estes\nSecretariat's Birthplace\nLocated in Doswell, Caroline County, Virginia, Meadow Stable was also called The Meadow. On Easter Monday, March 30, 1970, at 12:10\u00a0a.m. at the Meadow Stable, Somethingroyal foaled a bright-red chestnut colt with three white socks and a star with a narrow stripe. The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later. Howard Gentry, the manager of Meadow Stable, was at the foaling and later said, \"He was a very well-made foal. He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered.\" The colt soon distinguished himself from the others. \"He was always the leader in the crowd,\" said Gentry's nephew, Robert, who also worked at the farm. \"To us, he was Big Red, and he had a personality. He was a clown and was always cutting up, always into some devilment.\" Sometime later, Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one-word entry in her notebook - \"Wow!\"\nThat fall, Chenery and Elizabeth Ham, the Meadow's longtime secretary, worked together to name the newly weaned colt. The first set of names submitted to the Jockey Club (Sceptre, Royal Line, and Something Special) played on the names of his sire and dam but were rejected. The second set, submitted in January 1971, were Games of Chance, Deo Volente (\"God Willing\"), and Secretariat. Ham suggested naming the colt Secretariat after her former job in the secretariat of the League of Nations (predecessor of the United Nations). Ham had worked for diplomat Norman Davis sometime between 1920\u20131946, maybe around the time of his appointment in 1924. \nAppearance and conformation.\nSecretariat grew into a massive, powerful horse said to resemble his sire's damsire, Discovery. He stood \u00a0hands when fully grown. He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, described as having \"nearly perfect\" conformation and stride biomechanics. His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, \"He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. I never saw anything like him.\"\nSecretariat's absence of major conformation flaws was important, as horses with well formed limbs and feet are less likely to become injured. Secretariat's hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.\nThe manner in which Secretariat's body parts fit together determined the efficiency of his stride, which affected his acceleration and endurance. Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major effect on performance. Secretariat was well put together even as a two-year-old, and by the time he was three, he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait. The New York Racing Association's Dr. M. A. Gilman, a veterinarian who routinely measured leading thoroughbreds with a goal of applying science to create better ways to breed and evaluate racehorses, measured Secretariat's development from two to three as follows:\nSecretariat's length of stride was considered large even after taking into account his large frame and strong build. While training for the Preakness Stakes, his stride was measured as 24 feet, 11 inches. His powerful hindquarters allowed him to unleash \"devastating\" speed and because he was so well-muscled and had significant cardiac capacity, he could simply out-gallop competitors at nearly any point in a race.\nHis weight before the Gotham Stakes in April 1973 was . After completing the gruelling Triple Crown, his weight on June 15 had dropped only 24 pounds, to . Secretariat was known for his appetite \u2014 during his three-year-old campaign, he ate of oats a day \u2014 and to keep his muscles in good condition, he needed fast workouts that could have won many a stakes race.\nSeth Hancock of Claiborne Farm once said,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\"You want to know who Secretariat is in human terms? Just imagine the greatest athlete in the world. The greatest. Now make him six-foot-three, the perfect height. Make him real intelligent and kind. And on top of that, make him the best-lookin' guy ever to come down the pike. He was all those things as a horse.\"\nRacing career.\nSecretariat raced in Meadow Stable's memorable blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced in track bandages, but typically wore a blinker hood, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in toward the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. \"He was a big fat sucker,\" Davis said. \"I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to.\" Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as \"having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before\" It was Gaffney who nicknamed the horse, \"Big Red\".\nGroom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, \"I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him.\"\nLaurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat's progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat. Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: \"Your big Bold Ruler colt don't show me nothin'. He can't outrun a fat man.\" But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring. On June 6, he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half-mile workout in a solid 47&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 seconds. On June 24, he ran a \"bullet,\" the fastest workout of the day, at 6 furlongs in 1:12&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445 on a sloppy track. Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race.\n1972: Two-year-old season.\nFor his first start on July 4, 1972, at Aqueduct Racetrack, Secretariat was made the lukewarm favorite at 3\u20131. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut in front of the field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he would have fallen if he hadn't been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position at the top of the stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20444 lengths. In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat hung back at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.\nWith Feliciano again up, Secretariat returned to the track on July 15 as the 6\u20135 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stable. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat's commanding win as the 2\u20135 favorite caught the attention of veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, \"You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, 'This is it.' I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn't believe my eyes, frankly.\"\nIn August, Secretariat entered the Sanford Stakes, facing off with highly regarded Linda's Chief, the only horse ever to be favored against Secretariat in any of his races. Entering the stretch, Secretariat was blocked by the horses in front of him but then made his way through \"like a hawk scattering a barnyard of chickens\" on his way to a three-length win. Sportswriter Andrew Beyer covered the race for the \"Washington Star\" and later wrote, \"Never have I watched a lightly raced 2-year-old stamp himself so definitively as a potential great.\"\nTen days later in the Hopeful Stakes, Secretariat made a \"dazzling\" move, passing eight horses within &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 mile to take the lead then drawing off to win by five lengths. His time of 1:16&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445 for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20442 furlongs was only &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 of a second off the track record. Returning to Belmont Park on September 16, he won the Belmont Futurity by a length and a half after starting his move on the turn. He then ran in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 14 as the 7\u201310 favorite. As had become his custom, he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn, blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths. However, following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with Stop the Music, who was declared the winner.\nSecretariat then took the Laurel Futurity on October 28, winning by eight lengths over Stop the Music. His time on a sloppy track was just &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445 of a second off the track record. He completed his season in the Garden State Futurity on November 18, dropping back early and making a powerful move around the turn to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3+1\u20442 lengths at 1\u201310 odds. Laurin said, \"In all his races, he has taken the worst of it by coming from behind, usually circling his field. A colt has to be a real runner to do this consistently and get away with it.\"\nSecretariat won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse and, in a rare occurrence, two two-year-olds topped the balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors, with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly, La Prevoyante. Secretariat received the votes of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association. Only one horse since then, Favorite Trick in 1997, has won that award as a two-year-old.\n1973: Three-year-old season.\nIn January 1973, Christopher Chenery, the founder of Meadow Stable, died and the taxes on his estate forced his daughter Penny to consider selling Secretariat. Together with Claiborne Farm, she instead managed to syndicate the horse, selling 32 shares worth $190,000 each for a total of $6.08 million, a world syndication record at the time, surpassing the previous record for Nijinsky who was syndicated for $5.44 million in 1970. Hancock said the sale was easy, citing Secretariat's two-year-old performance, breeding, and appearance. \"He's, well, he's a hell of a horse.\" Chenery retained four shares in the horse and would have complete control over his three-year-old racing campaign, but agreed that he would be retired at the end of the year.\nSecretariat wintered in Florida but did not race until March 17, 1973, in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, where he went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer of one of his opponents put it, \"The only chance we have is if he falls down.\" Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had committed a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually on the receiving end of a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.\nIn the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin decided to experiment with Secretariat's running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat would be allowed to set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, matching the track record.\nHis final preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby was the Wood Memorial, where he finished a surprising third to Angle Light and Santa Anita Derby winner Sham. Laurin was crushed, even though he had trained the winner, Angle Light, who set a slow pace and \"stole\" the race. Secretariat's loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit. Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, Pancho Martin, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute concerned the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There was fear that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Laurin to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.\nBecause of the Wood Memorial results, Secretariat's chances in the Kentucky Derby became the subject of much speculation in the media. Some questioned his stamina: in part because of his \"blocky\" build, more typical of a sprinter, and in part because of Bold Ruler's reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters. Rumors circulated that Secretariat was unsound.\nKentucky Derby.\nThe 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3\u20132 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5\u20132. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths farther back in third.\nOn his way to a still-standing track record of 1:59&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were :25&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445, :24, :23&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445, :23&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.\nSportswriter Mike Sullivan later said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was at Secretariat's Derby, in '73\u00a0... That was\u00a0... just beauty, you know? He started in last place, which he tended to do. I was covering the second-place horse, which wound up being Sham. It looked like Sham's race going into the last turn, I think. The thing you have to understand is that Sham was fast, a beautiful horse. \"He\" would have had the Triple Crown in another year. And it just didn't seem like there could \"be\" anything faster than that. Everybody was watching him. It was over, more or less. And all of a sudden there was this, like, just a disruption in the corner of your eye, in your peripheral vision. And then before you could make out what it was, here Secretariat came. And then Secretariat had passed him. No one had ever seen anything run like that \u2014 a lot of the old guys said the same thing. It was like he was some other animal out there.\nPreakness Stakes.\nIn the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a photographer for the \"Daily Racing Form\", captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later used as the basis for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: \"I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, 'I don't want to get trapped here.' So I just breezed by them.\" Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.\nThe time of the race was disputed. The infield teletimer displayed a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, but two \"Daily Racing Form\" clockers claimed the time was 1:53&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by Ca\u00f1onero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Ca\u00f1onero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got to the finish line first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and \"Daily Racing Form\" times and recognized the clocker's 1:54&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 as the official time; however, the \"Daily Racing Form\", for the first time in history, printed its own clocking of 1:53&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.\nOn June 19, 2012, a special meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission was convened at Laurel Park at the request of Penny Chenery, who hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race. After over two hours of testimony, the commission unanimously voted to change the time of Secretariat's win from 1:54&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 to 1:53, establishing a new stakes record. The \"Daily Racing Form\" announced that it would honor the commission's ruling with regard to the running time. With the revised time, Sham also would have broken the old stakes record.\nAs Secretariat prepared for the Belmont Stakes, he appeared on the covers of three national magazines: \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Sports Illustrated\". He had become a national celebrity. William Nack wrote: \"Secretariat suddenly transcended horse racing and became a cultural phenomenon, a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of Watergate and the Vietnam War.\" Chenery needed a secretary to handle all the fan mail and hired the William Morris Agency to manage public engagements. Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to pose for the camera.\nBelmont Stakes.\nOnly four horses ran against Secretariat for the June 9 Belmont Stakes, including Sham and three other horses thought to have little chance by the bettors: Twice A Prince, My Gallant, and Private Smiles. With so few horses in the race, and Secretariat expected to win, no \"show\" bets were taken. Secretariat was sent off as a 1\u201310 favorite before a crowd of 69,138, then the second largest attendance in Belmont history. The race was televised by CBS and was watched by over 15 million households, an audience share of 52%.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHis only point of reference is himself.\n\u2014 Charles Hatton\nOn race day, the track was fast, and the weather was warm and sunny. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him. The two ran the first quarter in a quick :23&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 and the next quarter in a swift :22&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445, completing the fastest opening half mile in the history of the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte later said, \"This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I think he knew he was going &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles, I never pushed him.\" In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204416 of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.\nCBS Television announcer Chic Anderson described the horse's pace in a famous commentary:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe time for the race was not only a track record, it was the fastest &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles on dirt in history, 2:24 flat, breaking by more than two seconds the track and stakes record of 2:26&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 set 16 years earlier by Gallant Man. Secretariat's record still stands as an American record on the dirt. If the Beyer Speed Figure calculation had been developed during that time, Andrew Beyer calculated that Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139, the highest he has ever assigned.\nA large crowd had started gathering around the paddock hours before the Belmont, many missing the races run earlier in the day for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile; Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reportedly made the grandstand shake. \"The Blood-Horse\" magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: \"Two twenty-four flat! I don't believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can't breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! I saw it. I have to believe it.\"\nThe race is widely considered the greatest performance by a North American racehorse. Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years. Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).\nArlington Invitational.\nThree weeks after his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the June 30th Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: \"Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn't know how I could give this horse a rest. He's so strong and full of energy. Well, this is only a week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don't run this horse he's going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run.\" The race was run at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20448 miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6\u20131: Secretariat was 1\u201320 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.\nMayor Richard Daley of Chicago declared that the Saturday of the race was Secretariat Day. A crowd of 41,223 (the largest at Arlington in three decades) greeted his arrival on the track with sustained applause. Secretariat broke poorly but soon went to the lead, setting slow early fractions. He gathered momentum on the final turn and eventually won by nine lengths in 1:47 flat, just &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445 off the track record set by Damascus. George Plimpton commented, \"With a better start, a horse to press him and less bow to his turns, Secretariat might have posted a time that would have stood a century.\"\nThe July 10, 1973 \"New York Times\" reported that a number of Chicago fans in attendance did as their New York counterparts had in the Belmont Stakes and $11,170 worth of winning tickets on Secretariat had not been cashed.\nWhitney Stakes.\nSecretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed \"the graveyard of champions,\" in preparation for the Whitney Stakes on August 4, where he would face older horses for the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga's track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens-trained Onion, a four-year-old gelding that had set a track record at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20442 furlongs in his previous start. The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the inside rail. Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length. A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an \"astonishing\" upset.\nDespite Jerkens's reputation as the \"Giant Killer,\" Secretariat's stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. \"I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing,\" said Chenery. \"We knew he had a low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong.\"\nSecretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggish for several days. Charles Hatton wrote: \"He seemed distressingly ill walking off, and he missed the Travers. Returned to Belmont to point for the $250,000 Marlboro, the sport's pin-up horse looked bloody awful, rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre. It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did. He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks. Astonishingly, he gained weight and blossomed with every trial.\"\nMarlboro Cup.\nOn September 15, Secretariat returned to Belmont Park in the inaugural Marlboro Cup, which was originally intended to be a match race with stablemate Riva Ridge, the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner. After Secretariat's loss in the Whitney, the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country. Entries included 1972 turf champion and top California stakes winner Cougar II, Canadian champion Kennedy Road, 1972 American champion three-year-old colt Key to the Mint, Travers winner Annihilate 'Em (the only other three-year-old in the race), and Onion. Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds (one pound over the weight-for-age scale), Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds, scale weight, while Secretariat was at 124, three pounds over scale for his age. The field included five champions, and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them.\nIt rained the night before, but the track dried out by race time. Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth, while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road. Around the turn, Secretariat raced wide and started to make up ground. Coming into the stretch, Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge, while the other early leaders dropped back. Secretariat drew away to win, completing &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20448 miles in 1:45\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445, then a world record on the dirt for the distance. Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth. Turcotte said, \"Today he was the old Secretariat and he did it on his own.\" The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000, then the highest prize money offered: the win made Secretariat the 13th thoroughbred millionaire in history.\nWoodward Stakes.\nAfter the Marlboro Cup, the original plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 mile Woodward Stakes, just two weeks later, while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf in preparation for the Man o' War Stakes in October. It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old Prove Out, who pulled clear to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4+1\u20442 lengths despite carrying seven more pounds than Secretariat under the weight-for-age conditions of the race. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half on the dirt in Belmont Park's history despite the sloppy conditions. Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year's Jockey Club Gold Cup.\nMan o' War Stakes.\nOn October 8, just nine days after the Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O' War Stakes at a distance of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 miles. He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20448 miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445. After the race, Turcotte explained that \"when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away.\"\nCanadian International Stakes.\nThe syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat's last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between E. P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat's Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.\nThe day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a \"virtual hysteria\". His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, whom he had beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o' War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. \"Snorting steam in the raw twilight\", he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20442 lengths. Instead of the name Secretariat, his nickname \"Big Red\" was printed on the betting tickets. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir collectors.\nAfter the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. \"It's a sad day, and yet it's a great day,\" said Laurin. \"I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He's a great horse and he loves to run.\"\nAltogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of $1,316,808.\nFor 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year and also won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse.\nRetirement.\nStud career.\nWhen Secretariat first retired to Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed some signs of immaturity, so he was bred to three non-thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility. One of these, an Appaloosa named Leola, produced Secretariat's first foal in November 1974. Named First Secretary, the foal was a chestnut like his sire, but spotted like his dam.\nSecretariat's first official foal crop, arriving in 1975, consisted of 28 foals, the best of which was Dactylographer, who won the William Hill Futurity in October 1977. The first crop also included Canadian Bound, who at the 1976 Keeneland July sale was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier, selling for $1.5 million. Canadian Bound, however, was a complete failure in racing, and for several years, the value of Secretariat's offspring declined considerably, especially given the rising popularity of Northern Dancer's offspring in the sales ring.\nSecretariat eventually sired a number of major stakes winners, including:\nUltimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners (51.4%) and 54 stakes winners (8.1%). There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured through the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America. Overall, Secretariat's daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners. As a broodmare sire, Secretariat's most notable progeny were:\nThrough Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone, Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions. Weekend Surprises's son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome. A.P. Indy's leading sire-line descendant is Tapit, who led the sire list in 2014\u20132015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator. Terlingua's son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include Giant's Causeway, three-time leading sire in North America. Storm Cat also sired https://, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Both Storm Cat and A.P. Indy appear in the pedigree of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify.\nInbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, sprint champion Speightstown, and 2025 Saudi Cup winner Forever Young.\nAll of the horse racers in the 2025 Kentucky Derby are related to Secretariat. Each of the 19 horses that ran in the 2025 Kentucky Derby is a direct descendant of Secretariat. He has more than 600 registered foals.\nSecretariat's paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: https://, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid. Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor, but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks.\nDeath.\nIn the fall of 1989, Secretariat became afflicted with laminitis\u2014a painful and debilitating hoof condition. When his condition failed to improve after a month of treatment, he was euthanized on October 4 at the age of 19. Secretariat was buried at Claiborne Farm, given the rare honor of being buried whole (traditionally only the head, heart, and hooves of a winning race horse are buried).\nAt the time of Secretariat's death, the veterinarian who performed the necropsy, Thomas Swerczek, head pathologist at the University of Kentucky, did not weigh Secretariat's heart, but stated, \"We just stood there in stunned silence. We couldn't believe it. The heart was perfect. There were no problems with it. It was just this huge engine.\" Later, Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham, who died in 1993. Swerczek did weigh Sham's heart, and it was . Based on Sham's measurement, and having necropsied both horses, he estimated Secretariat's heart probably weighed , or about 2.5 times that of the average horse ().\nAn extremely large heart is a trait that occasionally occurs in thoroughbreds, hypothesized to be linked to a genetic condition, called the \"x-factor\" passed down in specific inheritance patterns. The x-factor can be traced to the historic racehorse Eclipse, who was necropsied after his death in 1789. Because Eclipse's heart appeared to be much larger than the hearts of other horses, it was weighed, and found to be , almost twice the normal weight. Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters, and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces his dam line to a daughter of Eclipse. Secretariat's success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this large heart theory. However, it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists, let alone if it contributes to athletic ability.\nHonors, recognition, and legacy.\nFollowing his Triple Crown victory in 1973, Secretariat was nominated for \"Sports Illustrated\"'s Sportsman of the Year. During the week of June 10, 1973, he also became the first athlete to appear on the covers of \"Time\", \"Newsweek\", and \"Sports Illustrated\" in the same week. In 1974, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. In 1994, \"Sports Illustrated\" ranked Secretariat #17 in their list of the 40 greatest sports figures of the past 40 years. In 1999, ESPN listed him 35th of the 100 greatest North American athletes of the 20th century, the highest of three non-humans on the list (the other two were also racehorses: Man o' War at 84th and Citation at 97th). Secretariat ranked second behind Man o' War in \"The Blood-Horse\"'s List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. He was also ranked second behind Man o' War by both a six-member panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press, and a \"Sports Illustrated\" panel of seven experts.\nPostage Stamp in 1999 \nIn 1999, the U.S. Postal Service honored Secretariat with a 33-cent U.S. postage stamp entitled \"Secretariat Wins Triple Crown\" in the \"Celebrate the Century (1970s\") series. The national unveiling ceremony was held in the winner's circle at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, Kentucky on Saturday, October 16, 1999. On Thursday, November 18, 1999, the First Day of Issue ceremony was held at the Postage Stamp Mega-event at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, New York. The stamp was issued to celebrate Secretariat and his iconic 1973 Triple Crown victory. The following text is in the packet: \u201cSecretariat Wins Triple Crown\" \u2013 In 1972, two-year-old Secretariat was named Horse of the Year. In 1973, he won the coveted Triple Crown, including the only less-than-two-minute Kentucky Derby victory and a 31-length Belmont Stakes triumph.\" \nThe stamp is among those listed in the Smithsonian Institution's record of exhibitions called, \"Trailblazers and Trendsetters: Art of the Stamp: Sports.\" The description about the Secretariat stamp reads as follows: \u201cAffectionately known as \"Big Red,\" Secretariat was a sturdy, chestnut-colored thoroughbred who made his racing debut on July 4, 1972. He won five contests that year and was named Horse of the Year. In 1973, Secretariat became the first horse in 25 years to win the coveted Triple Crown. In May of that year, he ran the Kentucky Derby in less than two minutes, the fastest finish ever recorded at the prestigious race. The colt then went on to win the Preakness Stakes and, in June, the Belmont Stakes, which he won by a triumphant 31 lengths.\u201d The description includes this information about the artwork: \u201cArtist: Kazuhiko Sano; Art Director: Howard Paine; Medium: Acrylic on Gesso Board; and Year of Issue: 1999.\u201d The painted image looks like an exact copy of the painting on the cover of the June 11, 1973 (Vol. 101, No. 24) issue of \"TIME\" Magazine. The stamp was in a collection called Celebrate the Century (1970). Issued on November 18, 1999, the Secretariat stamp is on the left side of the third row of the sheet of 15 stamps celebrating the 1970s entitled: \"Bicentennial, Watergate, and Earth Day\".\nMore Honors\nIn 2005, Secretariat was featured in ESPN Classic's show \"Who's No. 1?\" in the episode \"Greatest Sports Performances.\" He was the only nonhuman on the list, with his run at Belmont ranking second behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game. On May 2, 2007, Secretariat was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, marking the first time an animal received this honor. In 2013, Secretariat was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in honor of his victory in the Canadian International 40 years earlier. Secretariat was also the focus of a 2013 segment of \"60 Minutes Sports\". In March 2016, Secretariat's Triple Crown victory was rated #13 in the \"Sports Illustrated\" listing of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History.\nVox Populi Award and Healing Horses\nDue to Secretariat's enduring popularity, Chenery remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017. In 2004, the Maker's Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi (\"voice of the people\") Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge \"the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for thoroughbred racing.\" The consideration of the racing fan's engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta, that year's Horse of the Year, while the second award went to Rapid Redux, a former claimer who went on to win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks. Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis, the same condition that led to Secretariat's death. \"Paynter's popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year's Vox Populi Award,\" said Chenery. \"After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter\u2014a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit.\"\nMore Memorials\nVarious states and localities have also honored Secretariat. According to ESPN, 263 roads in the United States are named after him, more than any other athlete. Secretariat Drive is the most common option. In Illinois, the Secretariat Stakes was created in 1974 to honor his appearance at Arlington Park in 1973. In honor of Secretariat and Kentucky's horse racing history, the University of Kentucky football uniforms incorporate blue-and-white checkers reminiscent of the silks of Meadow Stable.\nHonors in Virginia.\nHistoric Secretariat's Birthplace\nMeadow Stable and farm in Doswell, Virginia, Secretariat's birthplace and the stable where he was foaled, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was also called \"The Meadow\", and is now known as The Meadow Historic District. \n\"The Meadow Event Park,\" formerly Meadow Stable, is the site where Secretariat was born (foaled), raised and first trained. The foaling shed where Secretariat was born was moved to the south side of the property from its original location on the north side, and is the same structure that is listed on the state and national historic registers. Secretariat\u2019s training barn where he stayed when he was in training at the Meadow training track in the fall of 1971 is also there. A plaque marks the stall where he first wore a saddle and bridle and had a jockey on his back. Other points of interest include the original yearling and stallion barns built in the 1930s, the stall in the yearling barn where Secretariat stayed as a colt in 1971, the Cove where the Meadow mares and foals grazed, Secretariat stride markers showing his enormous 25-foot racing stride, Meadow Hall mansion with galleries of framed photos depicting the history of the farm and Secretariat\u2019s Triple Crown races, Meadow Stable memorabilia, and the riding outfits of Penny Chenery and her father Christopher Chenery. \nHorses buried in Meadow Stable horse cemetery include Imperatrice, Hill Prince and Sun Beau. The historic cemetery on the front lawn of the mansion is marked with a memorial plaque about the Morris family who founded the Meadow in 1805. Their descendant, Christopher Chenery established Meadow Stable in 1936 here at his ancestral home. \n50th anniversary bourbon \nIn 2023, the Virginia ABC honored 50th Anniversary of Secretariat's Triple Crown win by making Ragged Branch Secretariat Reserve bourbon. There were also special drinks at the three Triple Crown races in 2023. \nAlong with others celebrating the historic Triple Crown anniversary in 2023, the Kentucky Derby Museum sold commemorative \"Secretariat Bottles\" of Woodford Reserve Kentucky Derby 149th Secretariat / 50th Anniversary Straight Bourbon Whiskey. It was is the only Woodford Reserve Double Oaked Personal Selection pick of 2022. The bottle was custom-labeled with Kentucky Derby Museum, and Secretariat\u2019s Kentucky Derby record-breaking time of 1:59 2/5, a record that still stands today. \nThe Kentucky legislature has honored him in many ways including with memorials, statues, and periodical proclamations. \n50TH ANNIVERSARY PROCLAMATION\nSecretariat has been honored multiple times by Virginia's General Assembly with various anniversary proclamations. \u201cHouse Joint Resolution No. 479 Commemorating the 50th anniversary of Secretariat's Triple Crown victory\u201d had two patrons in the House of Delegates \u2013 chief patron, Hyland F. \"Buddy\" Fowler, Jr. (R) of Caroline County, and the co-patron, Paul E. Krizek (D) of Mount Vernon. They offered the bill on January 11, 2023.\u00a0It was agreed to by the Virginia House of Delegates on January 16, 2023, and then by the Virginia Senate and enrolled on January 19, 2023. In 2023, Caroline County received a proclamation by the General Assembly to honor the 50th anniversary of Secretariat's record-setting Triple Crown-win. \nCommemorating the 50th anniversary of Secretariat's Triple Crown victory\nWHEREAS, Secretariat, one of the best-known thoroughbred racehorses in the history of the sport,\nwas born on March 30, 1970, at Meadow Farm, in Caroline County; and\nWHEREAS, Secretariat, a strapping chestnut colt, was unanimously voted America's Horse of the\nYear as a two-year-old in 1972, the first juvenile ever so honored; and\nWHEREAS, as a three-year-old in 1973, Secretariat became the first thoroughbred in 25 years to win\nracing's coveted Triple Crown\u2013\u2013the Kentucky Derby in Louisville, the Preakness Stakes in Baltimore,\nand the Belmont Stakes in New York\u2013\u2013in the brief span of five weeks; and\nWHEREAS, Secretariat accomplished the unprecedented feat of breaking the stakes' record in all\nthree Triple Crown races, including the one and one-quarter mile Kentucky Derby in one minute and 59\nand two-fifths seconds, the one and three-sixteenths mile Preakness Stakes in one minute and 53\nseconds, and the one and one-half mile Belmont Stakes in two minutes and 24 seconds flat; and\nWHEREAS, Secretariat's astonishing 31-length victory in the Belmont Stakes is widely perceived as\nthe single greatest performance in the history of the ancient sport of kings; and\nWHEREAS, Secretariat was again voted America's Horse of the Year at the conclusion of the 1973\nseason; and\nWHEREAS, as a breeding stallion, Secretariat had a lasting impact on the thoroughbred breed,\nespecially through his daughters from whom additional champions have been issued; and\nWHEREAS, Secretariat, who died in 1989, is today considered by many equestrians to be the\ngreatest thoroughbred in the modern history of American horse racing, and is the standard of excellence\nagainst which all other racehorses have been measured for a half of a century; now, therefore, be it\nRESOLVED by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, That the General Assembly hereby\ncommemorate Secretariat's Triple Crown victory on the 50th anniversary of the races in 2023; and, be it\nRESOLVED FURTHER, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates prepare a copy of this resolution\nfor presentation to the Caroline County Board of Supervisors, representing the citizens of Caroline\nCounty, as an expression of the esteem in which the memory of Secretariat, among the finest athletes\never born in the Commonwealth, is held by the members of the General Assembly.\nStatues.\nIn 1974, Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as \"Secretariat in Full Stride\", from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained in the center of the walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica. The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nThe Kentucky Horse Park has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by Jim Reno in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner's circle after the Kentucky Derby.\nIn 2015, a statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Turcotte's hometown.\nOn October 12, 2019, a new monument was unveiled during the Secretariat Festival at Keeneland in Lexington. The two and a half times life-size bronze statue by Jocelyn Russell shows Secretariat and Turcotte winning the Kentucky Derby. After the Festival, it was permanently relocated to the center of the traffic circle at Old Frankfort Pike and Alexandria Drive. A duplicate statue by Russell began a tour in Ashland, Virginia in March 2023.\nMedia.\nLouisville's Churchill Downs was a set location for several racing scenes in the 2010 film, \"Secretariat\". The film, starring Diane Lane as Penny Chenery, John Malkovich as Lucien Laurin, and Otto Thorwarth as Ron Turcotte, was written by Mike Rich, directed by Randall Wallace, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. \nThe name of Secretariat is not found in Merriam-Webster\u2019s dictionary either as himself, nor under the word \u201csecretariat,\u201d an office for which he was named. However, he \"is\" mentioned under the definition of the word \u201cfoal\u201d as an example of its use. The entry used as an example is: \u201cFifty years ago, Secretariat, \"foaled\" in 1970, became the ninth Triple Crown winner, setting new track records in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes while setting the world record of 2:24 on a 1 1/2 dirt track in the Belmont Stakes. (\"The Courier-Journal\", 24 Apr. 2023)\u201d\nRacing statistics.\nSecretariat's earnings in 1973 were, at the time, a single-season record.\nPedigree.\nSecretariat was sired by Bold Ruler, who led the North America sire list eight times, more than any other stallion in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat's Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two. However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more. Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s can be traced directly to Bold Ruler in their &lt;dfn id=\"\"&gt;tail-male&lt;/dfn&gt; lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.\nSecretariat's dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in her only start, she had an excellent pedigree. Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted as a source of stamina and soundness. Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced three stakes winners: Sir Gaylord, First Family and Syrian Sea, the latter a full sister to Secretariat. Sir Gaylord became an important sire, whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor.\nBesides Secretariat, one of Somethingroyal\u2019s most important foals included Straight Flush (1975) sired by Riva Ridge. Through his dam, Riva Ridge is descended from Man o' War.\nBreeders speak of a \"nick\" occurring when a sire or grandsire produces significantly better offspring from the daughters of one particular sire than with mares from other bloodlines. The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal is an example of a famous nick between Bold Ruler's sire Nasrullah and daughters of Princequillo. The goal was to balance the speed, precocity, and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo's stamina, soundness, and sensible temperament.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62404", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62404", "title": "Lovebird", "text": "Genus of parrots\nLovebird is the common name for the genus Agapornis, a small group of parrots in the Old World parrot family Psittaculidae. Of the nine species in the genus, all are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to the African island of Madagascar. Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots' strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses, and seeds. Some species are kept as pets, and several coloured mutations have been selectively bred in aviculture. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years.\nDescription.\nLovebirds are in length, up to 24\u00a0cm in wingspan with 9\u00a0cm for a single wing and in weight. They are among the smallest parrots, characterised by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak. Wildtype lovebirds are mostly green with a variety of colours on their upper body, depending on the species. The Fischer's lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the masked lovebird have a prominent white ring around their eyes. Many colour mutant varieties have been produced by selective breeding of the species that are popular in aviculture. As of 2019[ [update]], there are 30 known plumage colour variations among lovebirds, which are caused by pigments called psittacofulvins.\nTaxonomy.\nThe genus \"Agapornis\" was described by the English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in 1836. The name combines the Ancient Greek \"agape\" meaning \"love\" and \"ornis\" meaning \"bird\". The type species is the black-collared lovebird (\"Agapornis swindernianus\"), which was originally placed into the genus \"Psittacus\" within a section called Psittacula by naturalist Heinrich Kuhl. Selby contended that this placement rather than a separate genus was \"artificial\" and done \"without regard to the structure, habits, or distribution of the species.\"\nThe genus contains nine species of which five are monotypic and four are divided into subspecies. They are native to mainland Africa and the island of Madagascar. In the wild, the different species are separated geographically.\nTraditionally, lovebirds are divided into three groups:\nHowever, this division is not fully supported by phylogenetic studies, as the species of the dimorphic group are not grouped together in a single clade.\nSpecies.\nSpecies and subspecies:\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Common name\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:25%;\"|Scientific name and subspecies\n!scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15%; min-width:180px;\"|Range\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:29%;\"\n!scope\n\"col\" style\n\"width:16%; min-width:112px;\"\n!scope=\"row\"|Rosy-faced lovebirdor peach-faced lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Yellow-collared lovebird or masked lovebird\n!scope=\"row\"| Fischer's lovebird\n!scope=\"row\"|Lilian's lovebirdor Nyasa lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Black-cheeked lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Grey-headed lovebirdor Madagascar lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Black-winged lovebirdor Abyssinian lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Red-headed lovebirdor red-faced lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Black-collared lovebirdor Swindern's lovebird \n!scope=\"row\"|Long-legged lovebird\nNesting.\nDepending on the species of lovebird, the female will carry nesting material into the nest in various ways. The peach-faced lovebird, for example, tucks nesting material in the feathers of its rump.\nFeral populations.\nFeral populations of Fischer's lovebirds and masked lovebirds live in cities of East Africa. There are interspecific hybrids that exist between these two species. The hybrid has a reddish-brown head and orange on upper chest, but otherwise resembles the masked lovebird.\nThere are two feral colonies present in the Pretoria region (Silver Lakes, Faerie Glen and Centurion) in South Africa. They probably originated from birds that escaped from aviaries. They consist mostly of masked, black cheeked, Fischer and hybrid birds and vary in colours. White (not albino) and yellow as well as blue occur in many cases. The white ringed eyes are very prominent.\nThere is a notable feral colony in Arizona, consisting of mostly Rosy-faced lovebirds. They originated from birds that escaped the pet trade, and were first seen in the state during the 1980's. The first breeding pair in Arizona was discovered in 1998.\nDiet and health.\nParrot species (including cockatiels) are biologically vegetarian species. Lovebirds forage for their food. In the wild, their diet mainly consists of seeds, grains, and leaves from trees, shrubs, and tall grass. \nWild lovebirds may harbor diseases such as avian polyomavirus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Although the group was prehistorically more globally widespread, all of the existing species are restricted to Maritime Southeast Asia, predominantly in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.They are found primarily in forested habitats, especially forests that have liana, since the vine gives tarsiers vertical support when climbing trees.\nEvolutionary history.\nFossil record.\nFossils of tarsiiform primates have been found in Asia, Europe, and North America (with disputed fossils from Northern Africa), but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands. The fossil record indicates that their dentition has not changed much, except in size, over the past 45 million years.\nWithin the family Tarsiidae, there are two extinct genera\u2014\"Xanthorhysis\" and \"Afrotarsius\"; however, the placement of \"Afrotarsius\" is not certain, and it is sometimes listed in its own family, Afrotarsiidae, within the infraorder Tarsiiformes, or considered a simian (anthropoid) primate.\nSo far, four fossil species of tarsiers are known from the fossil record:\nThe genus \"Tarsius\" has a longer fossil record than any other primate genus, but the assignment of the Eocene and Miocene fossils to the genus is dubious.\nClassification.\nThe phylogenetic position of extant tarsiers within the order Primates has been debated for much of the 20th century, and tarsiers have alternately been classified with strepsirrhine primates in the suborder Prosimii, or as the sister group to the simians (Anthropoidea) in the infraorder Haplorhini. Analysis of SINE insertions, a type of macromutation to the DNA, is argued to offer very persuasive evidence for the monophyly of Haplorhini, where other lines of evidence, such as DNA sequence data, remain ambiguous. Thus, some systematists argue the debate is conclusively settled in favor of a monophyletic Haplorrhini. In common with simians, tarsiers have a mutation in the L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) gene, which prevents their bodies from synthesizing vitamin C so they must find it in the diet. Since the strepsirrhines do not have this mutation and have retained the ability to make vitamin C, the genetic trait that confers the need for it in the diet would tend to place tarsiers with haplorhines.\nAt a lower phylogenetic level, the tarsiers have, until recently, all been placed in the genus \"Tarsius\", while it was debated whether the species should be placed in two (a Sulawesi and a Philippine-western group) or three separate genera (Sulawesi, Philippine and western groups). Species level taxonomy is complex, with morphology often being of limited use compared to vocalizations. Further confusion existed over the validity of certain names. Among others, the widely used \"T. dianae\" has been shown to be a junior synonym of \"T. dentatus\", and comparably, \"T. spectrum\" is now considered a junior synonym of \"T. tarsier\".\nIn 2010, Colin Groves and Myron Shekelle suggested splitting the genus \"Tarsius\" into three genera, the Philippine tarsiers (genus \"Carlito\"), the western tarsiers (genus \"Cephalopachus\"), and the eastern tarsiers (genus \"Tarsius\"). This was based on differences in dentition, eye size, limb and hand length, tail tufts, tail sitting pads, the number of mammae, chromosome count, socioecology, vocalizations, and distribution. The senior taxon of the species, \"T. tarsier\" was restricted to the population of a Selayar island, which then required the resurrection of the defunct taxon \"T. fuscus\".\nIn 2014, scientists published the results of a genetic study from across the range of the Philippine tarsier, revealing previously unrecognised genetic diversity. Three subspecies are recognised in the established taxonomy: \"Carlito syrichta syrichta\" from Leyte and Samar, \"C. syrichta fraterculus\" from Bohol, and \"C. syrichta carbonarius\" from Mindanao. Their analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggested that ssp. \"syrichta\" and \"fraterculus\" may represent a single lineage, whereas ssp. \"carbonarius\" may represent two lineages \u2013 one occupies the majority of Mindanao while the other is in northeastern Mindanao and the nearby Dinagat Island, which the authors termed the 'Dinagat-Caraga tarsier'. More detailed studies that integrate morphological data will be needed to review the taxonomy of tarsiers in the Philippines.\nAnatomy and physiology.\nTarsiers are small animals with enormous eyes; each eyeball is approximately in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. The head and body range from 10 to 15\u00a0cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25\u00a0cm long. Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color.\nTarsier morphology allows for them to move their heads 180 degrees in either direction, allowing for them to see 360 degrees around them. Their dental formula is also unique: 2.1.3.31.1.3.3 Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer (tapetum lucidum) of the retina and have a fovea.\nThe tarsier's brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect. Some neuroscientists suggested that \"this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution.\"\nPhilippine tarsiers are capable of hearing frequencies as high as 91\u00a0kHz. They are also capable of vocalizations with a dominant frequency of 70\u00a0kHz.\nUnlike most primates, male tarsiers do not have bacula.\nBehavior.\nPygmy tarsiers differ from other species in terms of their morphology, communication, and behavior. The differences in morphology that distinguish pygmy tarsiers from other species are likely based on their high altitude environment.\nAll tarsier species are nocturnal in their habits, but like many nocturnal organisms, some individuals may show more or less activity during the daytime. Based on the anatomy of all tarsiers, they are all adapted for leaping even though they all vary based on their species.\nEcological variation is responsible for differences in morphology and behavior in tarsiers because different species become adapted to local conditions based on the level of altitude. For example, the colder climate at higher elevations can influence cranial morphology.\nTarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals and are sensitive to bright lights, loud noises, and physical contact. They have been reported to behave suicidally when stressed or kept in captivity.\nPredators.\nDue to their small size, tarsiers are prey to various other animals. Tarsiers primarily inhabit the lower vegetation layers as they face threats from both terrestrial predators such as cats, lizards, and snakes, and aerial predators such as owls and birds. By residing in these lower layers, they can minimize their chances of being preyed upon by staying off the ground and yet still low enough to avoid birds of prey.\nTarsiers, though known as being shy and reclusive, are known to mob predators. In nature, mobbing is the act of harassing predators to reduce the chance of being attacked. When predators are near, tarsiers will make a warning vocalization. Other tarsiers will respond to the call, and within a short period of time, 2-10 tarsiers will show up to mob the predator. The majority of the group consists of adult males, but there will occasionally be a female or two. While tarsier groups only contain one adult male, males from other territories will join in the mob event, meaning there are multiple alpha male tarsiers attacking the predator.\nDiet.\nTarsiers are the only entirely carnivorous extant primates, albeit mainly insectivorous, catching invertebrates by jumping at them. The tarsiers also opportunistically prey on a variety of arboreal and small forest animals, including orthopterans, scarab beetles, small flying frogs, lizards and, occasionally, amphibious crabs that climb into the lower sections of trees. However, it has been found that their favorite prey are arthropods, beetles, arachnids, cockroaches, grasshoppers, katydids, cicadas, and walking sticks. Tarsiers are, rarely, also known to prey on baby birds, small tree snakes and even baby bats.\nReproduction.\nGestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone.\nConservation.\nTarsiers have never formed successful breeding colonies in captivity; this may be due in part to their special feeding requirements.\nA sanctuary near the town of Corella, on the Philippine island of Bohol, has had some success restoring tarsier populations. The Philippines Tarsier Foundation has developed a large, semi-wild enclosure known as the Tarsier Research and Development Center. Carlito Pizarras, also known as the \"Tarsier man\", founded the sanctuary, where visitors can observe tarsiers in the wild. The trees in the sanctuary are populated with nocturnal insects that make up the tarsier's diet.\nThe first quantitative study on the activity patterns of captive Philippine tarsiers (\"Tarsius syrichta\") was conducted at the Subayon Conservation Centre for the Philippine Tarsier in Bilar, Bohol. From December 2014 to January 2016, female and male \"T. syrichta\" were observed based on their time apportioned to normal activities during non-mating versus mating seasons. During the non-mating season, a significant amount of their waking hours were spent scanning prior to resting, foraging, and traveling. Feeding, scent-marking, self-grooming, social activities, and other activities were minimal. Scanning was still a common activity among the paired sexes during mating season. However, resting markedly decreased, while increases in travel and foraging were evident. \nThe 2008-described Siau Island tarsier in Indonesia is regarded as critically endangered and was listed among The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates by Conservation International and the IUCN/SCC Primate Specialist Group in 2008.\nThe Malaysian government protects tarsiers by listing them in the Totally Protected Animals of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, where they are commonly found.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The most common variants are gaff-rigged and staysail schooners, with the topsail schooner carrying a square topsail on the foremast, and Bermuda and junk-rigs being rarities.100\nName.\nThe term \"schooner\" first appeared in eastern North America in the early 1700s. The term may be related to a Scots word meaning to skip over water, or to skip stones.\nHistory.\nThe exact origins of schooner rigged vessels are obscure, but by early 17th century they appear in paintings by Dutch marine artists. The earliest known illustration of a schooner depicts a yacht owned by the mayors (Dutch: burgemeesters) of Amsterdam, drawn by the Dutch artist Rool in 1600. Later examples show schooners in Amsterdam in 1638 and New Amsterdam in 1627. Paintings by Van de Velde (1633\u20131707) and an engraving by Jan Kip of the Thames at Lambeth, dated 1697, suggest that schooner rig was common in England and Holland by the end of the 17th century. The \"Royal Transport\" was an example of a large British-built schooner, launched in 1695 at Chatham.\nThe type was further developed in British North America starting around 1713. In the 1700s and 1800s in what is now New England and Atlantic Canada schooners became popular for coastal trade, and being fast and versatile. Three-masted schooners were introduced around 1800.\nThe schooner rig was used in vessels for a wide range of purposes. Its good ability to windward was valuable to privateers, blockade runners, slave ships, smaller naval craft, pilot boats, and opium clippers. Packet boats (built for the fast conveyance of passengers and goods) were often schooners. Fruit schooners were noted for their quick passages, taking their perishable cargoes on routes such as the Azores to Britain. Some very large schooners with five or more masts were built in the United States from circa 1880\u20131920 for the bulk cargo trade, such as coal and timber. In yachting, schooners predominated in the early years of the America's Cup. In more recent times, schooners have been used as sail training ships.\nThe fishing vessels that worked the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were schooners, and held in high regard as an outstanding development of the type. This part of North American eastern seaboard is where the term \"schooner\" first began to be used as a classification for a particular type of vessel. In merchant use, the ease of handling in confined waters and smaller crews relative to square rigged vessels contributed to the schooner's popularity, especially in the 19th century. Some schooners worked on deep sea routes. In British home waters, schooners usually had cargo-carrying hulls that were designed to take the ground in drying harbors (or, even, to unload dried out on an open beach). The last of these once-common craft had ceased trading by the middle of the 20th century. \nSchooners were popular on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1800s and early 1900s. By 1910, 45 five-masted and 10 six-masted bulk-cargo schooners had been built in Bath, Maine, and in towns on Penobscot Bay, including the \"Wyoming\", which is considered the largest wooden ship ever built. The \"Thomas W. Lawson\" was the only seven-masted schooner built.\nRig types.\nThe rig is rarely found on a hull of less than 50 feet LOA, and small schooners are generally two-masted. In the two decades around 1900, larger multi-masted schooners were built in New England and on the Great Lakes with four, five, six, or even seven masts. Schooners were traditionally gaff-rigged, and some schooners sailing today are reproductions of famous schooners of old, but modern vessels tend to be Bermuda rigged (or occasionally junk-rigged). While a sloop rig is simpler and cheaper, the schooner rig may be chosen on a larger boat to reduce the overall mast height and keep each sail smaller, and thus easier to handle and reef. Two-masted schooners display a variety of sails filling the gaps between them, such as a gaff sail on the foremast (even with a Bermuda mainsail), or a main staysail, often with a fisherman staysail to fill the gap at the top in light airs.\nSchooner types are defined by their rig configuration. Most have a bowsprit although some were built without one for such as \"Adventure\".\nSome specific types of schooner include:\nUses.\nSchooners were built primarily for cargo, passengers, and fishing.\nThe Norwegian polar schooner \"Fram\" was used by both Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen in their explorations of the poles.\n\"America\", namesake of the America's Cup, was one of the few schooners ever designed for racing. This race was long dominated by schooners. Three-masted schooner \"Atlantic\" set the transatlantic sailing record for a monohull in the 1905 Kaiser's Cup race. The record remained unbroken for nearly 100 years. \"Bluenose\" (1921\u20131946) was both a successful fishing boat and a racer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
