It is the opening track and lead single from the band's second album, \"Nevermind\" (1991), released on DGC Records. Having sold over 13 million units worldwide, it is one of the best-selling songs of all time. The success propelled \"Nevermind\" to the top of several albums charts and is often marked as the point when grunge entered the mainstream. It was Nirvana's biggest hit, charting high on music industry charts around the world in 1991 and 1992, and was number one on the charts in Belgium, France, New Zealand and Spain. \nThe guitarist and singer, Kurt Cobain, described \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as an attempt to write \"the ultimate pop song\", inspired by the soft-and-loud dynamics of the Pixies. The title derives from a phrase written by his friend Kathleen Hanna, the singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill: \"Kurt smells like Teen Spirit.\" Hanna was referencing the deodorant Teen Spirit, but Cobain misinterpreted it as a revolutionary slogan. \nThe music video depicts a high school pep rally which ends in chaos, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film \"Over the Edge\" and the Ramones' film \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\". It won two MTV Video Music Awards, and was in heavy rotation on MTV during the 1990s. Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's programming department, said the video \"changed the entire look of MTV\" by giving the channel \"a whole new generation to sell to\". In 2000, the \"Guinness World Records\" named \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" the most played video on MTV Europe.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was met with acclaim and described as an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X. It was included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". In 2001, the Recording Industry Association of America ranked it number 80 on their Songs of the Century list. In 2002, \"NME\" named it the second-greatest single, and in 2013 \"Kerrang!\" ranked it the greatest. In 2021, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" fifth on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\nWriting and recording.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was one of several songs written following Nirvana's first recording sessions with producer Butch Vig in 1990. Lead singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain began writing it a few weeks before recording their second album, \"Nevermind\", in 1991. He said it was an attempt to write a song in the style of the Pixies, a band he admired:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWhen Cobain presented the song to his bandmates, it comprised just the main guitar riff and the chorus vocal melody. Cobain said the riff was \"clich\u00e9d\", similar to a riff by Boston or the Richard Berry song \"Louie Louie\". Bassist Krist Novoselic dismissed it as \"ridiculous\"; in response, Cobain made the band play it for an hour and a half. Eventually, Novoselic began playing it more slowly, inspiring drummer Dave Grohl to create the drum beat, which drew from disco artists such as the Gap Band. As a result, it is the only song on \"Nevermind\" to credit all three band members as writers.\nThe title derives from a phrase written on Cobain's wall by his friend Kathleen Hanna, singer of the riot grrrl band Bikini Kill: \"Kurt smells like Teen Spirit.\" Hanna meant that Cobain smelled like the deodorant Teen Spirit, which she and Tobi Vail, his then-girlfriend, had discovered during a trip to the grocery store. Cobain said that he was unaware of the deodorant until months after the single was released, and had interpreted it as a revolutionary slogan, as they had been discussing anarchism and punk rock.\nPrior to the album recording, the band sent Vig demos for songs including \"Teen Spirit\". While the sound was distorted due to the band playing at a high volume, Vig felt it had promise. Vig and the band recorded \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at Sound City Studios in the Los Angeles, California neighborhood of Van Nuys in May1991. Vig suggested changes to the arrangement, including moving a guitar ad lib to the chorus and shortening the chorus. The band recorded the basic track in three takes, and used the second take. Vig corrected some timing errors created by Cobain switching between his guitar effects pedals. Cobain recorded only three vocal takes; according to Vig, \"I was lucky to ever get Kurt to do four takes.\"\nMusic.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" is a grunge and alternative rock song. It was recorded in the original key of F minor and follows a F5-B\u266d5-A\u266d5-D\u266d5 chord progression, with the main guitar riff constructed from four power chords played in a syncopated sixteenth note strum by Cobain. The guitar chords were double tracked to create a \"more powerful\" sound. The chords occasionally lapse into suspended chord voicings as a result of Cobain playing the bottom four strings of the guitar for the thickness of sound. The riff resembles that of Boston's 1976 hit \"More Than a Feeling\", although it is not identical; the band would sometimes play a fragment of that song as an introduction. During the verses, Cobain used a Small Clone effect pedal to add a chorus effect.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" uses a \"somewhat conventional formal structure\" consisting of four-, eight-, and twelve-bar sections, including an eight-bar verse, an eight-bar pre-chorus, and a twelve-bar chorus. Musicologist Graeme Downes, who led the band the Verlaines, says that \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" illustrates developing variation. Elements of the structure are marked with shifts in volume and dynamics, moving from quiet to loud several times. This structure of \"quiet verses with wobbly, chorused guitar, followed by big, loud hardcore-inspired choruses\" became an alternative rock template.\nDuring the verses, the band maintains the same chord progression as the chorus. Cobain plays a two-note guitar line over Novoselic's root-note eighth note bassline, which outlines the chord progression. Approaching the chorus, Cobain begins to play the same two notes on every beat of the measure and repeats the word \"Hello\". Following the first and second choruses, Cobain simultaneously sings the word \"Yay\" and performs a unison bend on his guitar. After the second chorus, Cobain plays a 16-bar guitar solo restating his vocal melody from the verse and pre-chorus. During the closing refrain, Cobain sings \"A denial\" repeatedly; his voice becomes strained from the force of yelling.\nLyrics and interpretation.\nThe lyrics to \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" were often difficult for listeners to decipher, both due to their nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was compounded by the fact that the \"Nevermind\" album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, \"We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying.\" MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album\u2014and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs\u2014were later released with the liner notes of the \"Lithium\" single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was \"the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties\" and wrote, \"Like 'Louie', only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently.\" Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that \"what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang\", and added, \"Worst of all, I'm not sure that I know more about [the meaning of] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts.\"\nThe book \"Teen Spirit: The Stories Behind Every Nirvana Song\" describes \"Teen Spirit\" as \"a typically murky Cobain exploration of meaning and meaninglessness\". Azerrad plays upon the juxtaposition of Cobain's contradictory lyrics (such as \"It's fun to lose and to pretend\") and states \"the point that emerges isn't just the conflict of two opposing ideas, but the confusion and anger that the conflict produces in the narrator\u2014he's angry that he's confused\". Azerrad's conclusion is that the song is \"alternately a sarcastic reaction to the idea of actually having a revolution, yet it also embraces the idea\". Additionally, the \"famously obscure couplet\"\u2014\"A mulatto, an albino / A mosquito, my libido\"\u2014is, according to Azerrad, \"nothing more than two pairs of opposites, a funny way of saying the narrator is very horny\". In \"Heavier Than Heaven\", Charles R. Cross' biography of Cobain, Cross argues that the song is a reference to Cobain's relationship with ex-girlfriend Tobi Vail. Cross cites the line \"She's over-bored and self-assured\" and states the song \"could not have been about anyone else\". Cross backs up his argument with lyrics which were present in earlier drafts, such as \"Who will be the King &amp; Queen of the outcasted [\"sic\"] teens\".\n\"Teen Spirit\" is widely interpreted as a teen revolution anthem, an interpretation reinforced by the music video. In an interview conducted the day \"Nevermind\" was released, Cobain stated the song was about his friends, explaining, \"We still feel as if we're teenagers because we don't follow the guidelines of what's expected of us to be adults ... It also has kind of a teen revolutionary theme.\" In Michael Azerrad's biography \"\", Cobain said he felt a duty \"to describe what I felt about my surroundings and my generation and people my age\". He also said, \"The entire song is made up of contradictory ideas ... It's just making fun of the thought of having a revolution. But it's a nice thought.\" As Cobain did more interviews, he changed his explanation of the song and rarely gave specifics about the meaning. Grohl stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, \"Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has a lot to say about something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes.\"\nRelease and reception.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was released to radio on August 27, 1991. On September 10, it was released as the lead single from \"Nevermind\", Nirvana's major label debut on DGC Records. The song did not initially chart, and it sold well only in regions of the United States with an established Nirvana fanbase.\nThe single was intended to be a base-building alternative rock cut from the album, and was not expected to be a hit; the follow-up \"Come as You Are\" was planned as the single that could cross over to mainstream radio formats. However, campus and modern rock radio stations placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" on heavy rotation. Danny Goldberg of Nirvana's management firm Gold Mountain said: \"None of us heard it as a crossover song, but the public heard it and it was instantaneous ... They heard it on alternative radio, and then they rushed out like lemmings to buy it.\"\nThe video received its world premiere on MTV's late-night alternative rock program \"120 Minutes\" on September 29, and proved so popular that the channel began to air it during its regular daytime rotation. MTV added the video to its \"Buzz Bin\" selection in October, where it stayed until mid-December. By the end of the year, the song, music video, and the \"Nevermind\" album had become hits. \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Nevermind\" became a rare cross-format phenomenon, reaching all the major rock radio formats including modern rock, hard rock, album rock, and college radio.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was also a critical and commercial success. It topped the 1991 \"Village Voice\" \"Pazz &amp; Jop\" and \"Melody Maker\" year-end polls and reached number two on \"Rolling Stone's\" list of best singles of the year. The single peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart the same week that \"Nevermind\" reached number one on the albums chart. \"Teen Spirit\" hit number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and in April 1992 it was certified Platinum (onemillion copies shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of America. However, many American Top 40 stations were reluctant to play the song in regular rotation and restricted it to night-time play.\nThe single was also successful in other countries. In the United Kingdom, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was released on November 18, 1991, reaching number seven on the UK Singles Chart and charting for 184 weeks. The song was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal and Best Rock Song. \"Entertainment Weekly\" would later name Nirvana's loss to Eric Clapton in the Best Rock Song category as one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history. Outside the United States, the song topped the charts of Belgium, France, New Zealand, and Spain. It charted within the top five of several European countries and reached number five in Australia. In Israel, it was voted in at number 2 on the IBA's \"Voice of Israel\" singles chart. It appeared on several year-end charts, including number 10 in New Zealand, number 17 in Belgium and Germany, and number 32 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Year-End Chart.\nIn the wake of Nirvana's success, Michael Azerrad wrote in a 1992 \"Rolling Stone\" article: \"'Smells Like Teen Spirit' is an anthem for (or is it against?) the 'Why Ask Why?' generation. Just don't call Cobain a spokesman for a generation.\" Nevertheless, the music press awarded the song an \"anthem-of-a-generation\" status, placing Cobain as a reluctant spokesman for Generation X. \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"'Smells Like Teen Spirit' could be this generation's version of the Sex Pistols' 1976 single, 'Anarchy in the U.K.', if it weren't for the bitter irony that pervades its title ... as Nirvana knows only too well, teen spirit is routinely bottled, shrink-wrapped and sold\".\nNirvana grew uncomfortable with the song's success and, in later concerts, often excluded it from the set list. Prior to the release of the band's 1993 follow-up album \"In Utero\", Novoselic remarked, \"If it wasn't for 'Teen Spirit' I don't know how \"Nevermind\" would have done ... There are no 'Teen Spirits' on \"In Utero\".\" Cobain said in 1994, \"I still like playing 'Teen Spirit', but it's almost an embarrassment to play it ... Everyone has focused on that song so much.\"\nMusic video.\nThe music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the first for director Samuel Bayer. Bayer believed he was hired because his test reel was so poor the band anticipated his production would be \"punk\" and \"not corporate\". The video is based on the concept of a school concert which ends in anarchy and riot, inspired by Jonathan Kaplan's 1979 film \"Over the Edge\" and the Ramones' film \"Rock 'n' Roll High School\". It had an estimated budget of between $30,000 and $50,000.\nThe video was filmed on August 17, 1991, on Stage 6 of GMT Studios in Culver City. It features Nirvana playing at a pep rally in a high school gym to an audience of apathetic students on bleachers, and cheerleaders wearing black dresses with the Circle-A anarchist symbol. The video features an appearance by Burton C. Bell, later known as frontman of heavy metal band Fear Factory. Occasionally, the scene cuts to a janitor (played by Tony De La Rosa) wearing a navy blue jumpsuit and dancing with a push broom handle. The video ends with the students destroying the set and the band's gear. The discontent was genuine; the extras who filled the bleachers had been forced to stay seated through numerous replays of the song for an entire afternoon of filming. Cobain convinced Bayer to allow the extras to mosh, and the set became a scene of chaos. \"Once the kids came out dancing they just said 'fuck you', because they were so tired of his shit throughout the day,\" Cobain said.\nCobain disliked Bayer's final edit and oversaw a re-edit of the video, creating the final version. One of Cobain's major additions was the penultimate shot, a close-up of his face after it had been obscured for most of the video. Another major change involved two sequences of a principal standing next to a loudspeaker and being sprayed with confetti, and a teacher dressed like a nerd dancing to the song with a \"Dunce\" cap before being tied to a basketball hoop pole. Cobain had the principal footage and most of the teacher footage removed, aside from the ending scene which shows the teacher tied to the pole as the janitor sweeps the floor. Bayer said that unlike subsequent artists he worked with, Cobain was not vain, and was more interested that \"the video had something that was truly about what they were about\".\nReception.\nThe music video received positive reviews. The \"Rolling Stone\" writer David Fricke described the video as looking like \"the greatest gig you could ever imagine\". In addition to a number-one placing in the singles category, \"Teen Spirit\" also topped the music video category in the \"Village Voice\"'s 1991 \"Pazz &amp; Jop\" poll. The video won Nirvana the Best New Artist and Best Alternative Group awards at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards, and in 2000 the \"Guinness World Records\" named \"Teen Spirit\" the Most Played Video on MTV Europe. Amy Finnerty, formerly of MTV's Programming department, later said the video \"changed the entire look of MTV\" by giving them \"a whole new generation to sell to\".\n\"Rolling Stone\" placed the music video for \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at number two on their 1993 list of \"The 100 Top Music Videos\". MTV ranked the song's music video at number three on its \"100 Greatest Music Videos Ever Made\" list in 1999. VH1 placed the debut of the \"Teen Spirit\" video at number eighteen on its 2000 list of \"100 Greatest Rock &amp; Roll Moments on TV\", noting that it made alternative rock \"a commercial and pop culture force\". In 2001, VH1 named it the fourth-greatest video. The video was parodied in \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's music video for \"Smells Like Nirvana\" and referenced in Bob Sinclar's 2006 music video for \"Rock This Party (Everybody Dance Now)\". \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" had reached one billion YouTube views by December 25, 2019, and two billion by June 12, 2025.\nLive performances.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was first performed live on April 17, 1991 at the OK Hotel in Seattle, Washington. The performance is featured on the DVD of the 2004 box set \"With the Lights Out\", while shorter clips are included on the \"Classic Albums' Nevermind\" DVD, as well as the documentary film \"Hype!\". As the song's lyrics had not yet been entirely written, there are notable differences between it and the final version. For example, the first performance started with \"Come out and play, make up the rules\" instead of the eventual opening of \"Load up on guns, bring your friends\". A recording of the earlier version appears on \"With the Lights Out\" and again on '. A similar early live performance of the song is found in the documentary ', filmed during a 1991 summer tour in Europe with Sonic Youth.\nThe international television debut performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was on 8 November 1991, on the UK TV series \"The Word\". Cobain opened by declaring: \"I want everyone in this room to know that Courtney Love, the lead singer of the sensational pop group Hole, is the best fuck in the world.\" Cobain and Love married the following year.\nNirvana often altered the song's lyrics and tempo for live performances. Some live performances of the song had the line \"our little group has always been\" changed to \"our little tribe has always been\", which can be heard on the 1996 live album \"From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah\". \"Rolling Stone\" remarked that the \"Wishkah\" version of \"Teen Spirit\" \"[found] Cobain's guitar reeling outside the song's melodic boundaries and sparking new life in that nearly played-out hit\". A notable alternate performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" occurred on BBC's \"Top of the Pops\" in 1991, during which the band refused to mime to the pre-recorded backing track and Cobain deliberately sang the whole song an octave lower and altered numerous lyrics in the song (for example, \"Load up on guns, bring your friends\" became \"Load up on drugs, kill your friends\"). Cobain later said he was trying to sound like former Smiths frontman Morrissey. When \"Top of the Pops\" was cancelled in 2006, \"The Observer\" listed Nirvana's performance of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" as the third greatest in the show's history. This performance can be found on the 1994 home video \"Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!\".\nLegacy.\nDubbed an \"anthem for apathetic kids\" of Generation X, in the years following Cobain's 1994 suicide and Nirvana's breakup, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" has continued to garner critical acclaim, and is often listed as one of the greatest songs of all time. It was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\" in 1997. In 2000, VH1 rated the song at number forty-one on its \"100 Greatest Rock Songs\" list, while MTV and \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it third on their joint list of the \"100 Greatest Pop Songs\".&lt;ref name=\"MTV/RS 2000\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Recording Industry Association of America placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at number eighty on their 2001 \"Songs of the Century\" list. In 2002, \"NME\" awarded the song the number two spot on its list of \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\", with \"Kerrang!\" ranking it at number one on its own list of the \"100 Greatest Singles of All Time\". VH1 placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at number one on its list of \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years\" in 2003, while that same year, the song came third in a \"Q\" poll of the \"1001 Best Songs Ever\". In 2021, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" fifth on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\". The song was placed at number six in \"NME\"'s \"Global Best Song Ever Poll\" in 2005. In 2022, it was included in the list \"The story of \"NME\" in 70 (mostly) seminal songs\": Mark Beaumont wrote that with this song, Nirvana rejuvenated American rock, \"honing the melodic roars of Husker Du, Pixies, Dinosaur Jr and Sonic Youth into an MTV friendly quiet-loud dynamic\".\nIn the 2006 VH1 UK poll \"The Nation's Favourite Lyric\", the line \"I feel stupid and contagious / Here we are now, entertain us\" was ranked the third-favorite lyric by over 13,000 voters. VH1 placed \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" at number one on its list of the \"100 Greatest Songs Of The '90s\" in 2007, while \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number ten on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time\". In 2009, the song was voted number one for the third time in a row on the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time in Australia (it was first place previously in 1991 and 1998). That year, VH1 ranked the song seventh on its list of the \"100 Greatest Hard Rock Songs\". Despite previously proposing in its 2006 entry for \"Nevermind\" on \"The All-TIME 100 Albums\" that \"'Smells Like Teen Spirit' ... may be the album's worst song\", \"Time\" magazine later included it on its list of \"The All-TIME 100 Songs\" in 2011. That same year, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" kept its number nine ranking on \"Rolling Stone\"'s updated list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\", while in 2019, the magazine ranked it at number one in its list of \"50 Best Songs of the Nineties\". \"NME\" placed the song at number two on its list of the \"100 Best Tracks Of The '90s\" in 2012, and at number one on its list of \"The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" in 2014. In 2015, the song was also named the most iconic song of all time according to a study by Goldsmith's College, which analysed various songs featured in numerous 'all-time best' lists, using analytical software to compare their key, BPM, chord variety, lyrical content, timbral variety, and sonic variance\u00a0\u2013 the result of which designated the title to this song. In 2017, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.\n\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was rereleased as a limited edition 7-inch vinyl single in December2011. In an attempt to emulate a successful 2009 Facebook campaign to promote Rage Against the Machine's song \"Killing in the Name\", an online campaign was launched to promote \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" to 2011 Christmas number one in the UK Singles Chart in protest at the dealings of \"The X Factor\" television series with the children's charity Rhythmix. A similar campaign was also launched in Ireland to get the track to 2011 Christmas number one in the Irish Singles Chart. The campaign resulted in the song reaching number 11 on the UK Singles Chart, selling 30,000 copies. According to Nielsen Music's year-end report for 2019, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was the most-played song of the decade on mainstream rock radio with 145,000 spins. All of the songs in the top 10 were from the 1990s. In June 2021, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" became the second song from the 1990s to reach 1\u00a0billion streams on the Spotify platform. \nCovers and parodies.\nTori Amos recorded the song and released it in 1992 on her \"Crucify\" EP single. Dave Grohl commented on Nirvana covers in 1996: \"There are a few bands that go out there and do Nirvana covers and it's absolutely ridiculous, That's almost like desecration, that's what I think of it as. Tori Amos' take on it (Smells Like Teen Spirit) was fine. I mean that was pretty hilarious. She can do whatever the hell she wants.\" \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parodied the song in 1992 with \"Smells Like Nirvana\", a song about Nirvana itself. Cobain quickly gave permission, but asked, \"It's not about food, is it?\" Yankovic answered, \"No, it's about how nobody can understand your lyrics.\" Upon hearing the parody, Cobain and his bandmates laughed hysterically. Yankovic has said Cobain told him he realized that Nirvana had \"made it\" when he heard the parody. In 1995, the queercore band Pansy Division released a cover version with altered lyrics titled \"Smells Like Queer Spirit\" on their \"Pile Up\" album. Pansy Division guitarist Jon Ginoli insisted that his band's version of the song was not a parody but \"an affectionate tribute\". In the 2011 film \"The Muppets\" and its soundtrack, one of the acts of the Muppet Telethon involves Rowlf the Dog, Link Hogthrob, Sam Eagle, and Beaker performing the song as a barbershop quartet, where unwilling special guest Jack Black accuses them of \"ruining one of the greatest songs of all time\". The 2015 film \"Pan\" features a cover of the song performed by Hugh Jackman in character as the pirate Blackbeard and other members of the cast in a musical sequence that introduces the character and his crew. It was selected for the scene after other traditional pirate songs \"just wasn't jelling\" with the filmmakers during rehearsals. A version recorded by singer Malia J is used in the opening credits sequence of the 2021 film \"Black Widow\".\nFormats and track listing.\nAll lyrics are written by Kurt Cobain; all music is composed by Nirvana\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPersonnel.\nPersonnel adapted from \"Nevermind\" liner notes\nNirvana\nTechnical personnel\n\u2020 Appears in all release formats, except for UK 7\" and some promos.\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59995", "revid": "40781349", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59995", "title": "Battle of Dunbar (1296)", "text": "Part of the First War of Scottish Independence\nThe Battle of Dunbar was the only significant field action of the campaign of 1296 during the beginning of the First War of Scottish Independence.\nBackground.\nKing Edward I of England had invaded Scotland in March 1296 to punish King John Balliol for his refusal to support English military action in France. After the sack of Berwick-upon-Tweed, Edward rushed to complete the conquest of Scotland, remained in the town for a month, supervising the strengthening of its defences. On 5 April, he received a message from King John renouncing his homage, to which he remarked, \"O' foolish knave! What folly he commits. If he will not come to us we will go to him.\"\nThe next objective in the campaign was the Earl of March's castle at Dunbar, up the coast from Berwick. March was with the English, but his wife, Marjory Comyn, sister of the Earl of Buchan, did not share her husband's political loyalties and allowed her fellow Scots to occupy the castle. Edward sent one of his chief lieutenants, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey, John Balliol's own father-in-law, northwards with a strong force of knights to invest the stronghold. The defenders sent messages to King John, who bivouacked with the main body of his army at nearby Haddington, asking for urgent assistance. In response the army, or a large part of it, advanced to the rescue of Dunbar. John, who was showing even less skill as a commander than he had as a king, did not accompany it. The campaign of 1296 was now to enter its final phase.\nBattle.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;There is little evidence to suggest that Dunbar was anything other than an action between two bodies of mounted men-at-arms (armoured cavalry). Surrey's force seems to have comprised one formation (out of four) of the English cavalry; the Scots force led in part by Comyns probably represented the greater part of their cavalry element. The two forces came in sight of each other on 27 April. The Scots occupied a strong position on some high ground to the west. To meet them, Surrey's cavalry had to cross a gully intersected by the Spott Burn. As they did so their ranks broke up, and the Scots, deluded into thinking the English were leaving the field, abandoned their position in a disorderly downhill charge, only to find that Surrey's forces had reformed on Spottsmuir and were advancing in perfect order. The English routed the disorganised Scots in a single charge. The action was brief and probably not very bloody, since the only casualty of any note was a minor Lothian knight, Sir Patrick Graham, though about 100 Scottish lords, knights and men-at-arms were taken prisoner. According to one English source over ten thousand Scots died at the battle of Dunbar, however this is probably a confusion with the casualties incurred at the storming of Berwick. The survivors fled westwards to the safety of the Ettrick Forest. The following day King Edward appeared in person and Dunbar castle surrendered. Some important prisoners were taken: John Comyn, Earl of Buchan, and the earls of Atholl, Ross and Menteith, together with 130 knights and esquires. All were sent into captivity in England.\nAftermath.\nThe battle of Dunbar effectively ended with an English victory. The remainder of the campaign was little more than a grand mopping-up operation. James, the hereditary High Steward of Scotland, surrendered the important fortress at Roxburgh without attempting a defence, and others were quick to follow his example. Only Edinburgh Castle held out for a week against Edward's siege engines. A Scottish garrison sent out to help King John, who had fled north to Forfar, were told to provide for their own safety. Edward himself, true to his word, advanced into central and northern Scotland in pursuit of King John. Stirling Castle, which guarded the vital passage across the River Forth was deserted save for a porter who surrendered the castle to King Edward I. John reached Perth on 21 June, where he received messages from Edward asking for peace.\nJohn Balliol surrendered and submitted himself to a protracted abasement. At Kincardine Castle on 2 July he confessed to rebellion and prayed for forgiveness. Five days later in the kirkyard of Stracathro he abandoned the treaty with the French. The final humiliation came at Montrose on 8 July. Dressed for the occasion John was ceremoniously stripped of the vestments of royalty. Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham, ripped the red and gold arms of Scotland from his surcoat, thus bequeathing to history the nickname \"Toom Tabard\" (empty coat) by which John has been known to generations of Scottish schoolchildren. He and his son Edward were sent south into captivity. Soon after, the English king followed, carrying in his train the Stone of Scone and other relics of Scottish nationhood.\nBattlefield site.\nThe battlefield was considered for protection by Historic Scotland under the Scottish Historical Environment Policy 2009.\nIn 2012 the site was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland (https://). Historic Environment Scotland reports that no archaeological discoveries have been reported from the battle site, and that a 2007 dig failed to yield any battle-related finds. However, it considers that weaponry and other metal objects from the battle may lie undiscovered in the topsoil.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At the start of the Revolutions of 1848 in the German states, she was forced to flee. She proceeded to the United States via Austria, Switzerland, France and London, to return to her work as an entertainer and lecturer.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEliza Rosanna Gilbert was born into an Anglo-Irish family, the daughter of Ensign Edward Gilbert and Elizabeth (\"Eliza\") Oliver, who was the daughter of Charles Silver Oliver, a former High Sheriff of Cork and member of Parliament for Kilmallock in County Limerick, Ireland. Their residence was the former Castle Oliver, which stood a thousand yards to the south-west of the current castle by the same name. In December 1818, Eliza's parents met when Gilbert arrived with the 25th Regiment. They were married on 29 April 1820, and Eliza was born the following February, in the village of Grange in the north of County Sligo, refuting persistent rumours that her mother was pregnant with her at the time of the wedding. The family resided at King House in Boyle, County Roscommon, until early 1823, when they journeyed to Liverpool, England, and later departed for India on 14 March.\nPublished reports of Eliza's birthdate differ. For many years, it was accepted that she was born in Limerick, as she herself claimed, possibly on 23 June 1818; this is the year that was graven on her headstone. But when her baptismal certificate came to light in the late 1990s, it was established that Eliza Rosanna Gilbert was born in Grange, County Sligo, in Connacht, Ireland, on 17 February 1821. At the time of her birth, all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. She was baptised at St. Peter's Church in Liverpool on 16 February 1823, while her family was \"en route\" to her father's post in India.\nShortly after their arrival in India, Edward Gilbert died of cholera. Her mother, who was then 19, married Lieutenant Patrick Craigie the next year. Craigie quickly came to care for the young Eliza, but her spoiled and half-wild ways concerned him greatly. Eventually, it was agreed she would be sent back to Britain to attend school, staying with Craigie's father in Montrose, Scotland. But the \"queer, wayward little Indian girl\" rapidly became known as a mischief-maker. On one occasion, she stuck flowers into the wig of an elderly man during a church service; on another, she ran through the streets naked.\nAt the age of ten, Eliza was moved again\u2014this time to Sunderland, England, where her stepfather's older sister, Catherine Rae, set up a boarding school in Monkwearmouth with her husband. Eliza continued her education there. Her determination and temper became her trademarks. Her stay in Sunderland lasted only a year, as she was then transferred to a school in Camden Place (now Camden Crescent), Bath, for a more sophisticated education.\nIn 1837, 16-year-old Eliza eloped with Lieutenant Thomas James. The couple separated five years later, in Calcutta, India, and she became a professional dancer under a stage name.\nWhen she had her London debut as \"Lola Montez, the Spanish dancer\" in June 1843, she was recognised as \"Mrs. James\". The resulting notoriety hampered her career in England, so she departed for the continent, where she had success in Paris and Warsaw. At this time, she was almost certainly accepting favours from a few wealthy men, and was regarded by many as a courtesan.\nLife as a courtesan.\nIn 1844, Eliza, now known as Lola Montez, made a personally disappointing Parisian stage debut as a dancer in Fromental Hal\u00e9vy's opera \"Le lazzarone\". She met and had an affair with Franz Liszt, who introduced her to the circle of George Sand. After performing in various European capitals, she settled in Paris, where she was accepted into the city's literary bohemia, becoming acquainted with Alexandre Dumas, with whom she was also rumoured to have had a dalliance. In Paris she met Alexandre Dujarrier, \"owner of the newspaper with the highest circulation in France, and also the newspaper's drama critic\". Through their romance, Montez revitalised her career as a dancer. Later, after the two had their first quarrel over Montez's attendance at a party, Dujarrier attended the party and, in a drunken state, offended Jean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvallon. When Dujarrier was challenged to a duel by de Beauvallon, Dujarrier was shot and killed.\nIn 1846, Montez arrived in Munich, where she was discovered by and became the mistress of King Ludwig I of Bavaria. There was a rumour that when they first met, Ludwig asked her in public if her breasts were real. Her response to the question was to tear off enough of her garments to prove that they were. She soon began to use her influence on the king and this, coupled with her arrogant manner and outbursts of temper, made her extremely unpopular with the Bavarian people (particularly after documents were made public showing that she was hoping to become a naturalised Bavarian subject and be elevated to nobility). Despite opposition, Ludwig made her Countess of Landsfeld and Baroness of Rosenthal on his next birthday, 25 August 1847, and along with her title, he granted her a large annuity.\nFor more than a year, Montez exercised great political power, which she directed in favour of liberalism, anti-Catholicism, and in attacks against the Jesuits. Her ability to manipulate the king was so great that the Minister of State, Karl von Abel, was dismissed because he and his entire cabinet had objected to her being granted Bavarian nationality and the title of countess. The students at Munich University were divided in their sympathies, and conflicts arose shortly before the outbreak of the revolutions of 1848, which led the king, at Montez's insistence, to close the university.\nIn March 1848, under pressure from a growing revolutionary movement, the university was reopened, Ludwig abdicated in favor of his son, King Maximilian II, and Montez fled Bavaria, ending her career as a power behind the throne. It seems likely that Ludwig's relationship with Montez contributed greatly to his forced abdication despite his previous popularity.\nAfter a sojourn in Switzerland, where she waited in vain for Ludwig to join her, Montez made a brief excursion to France and then removed to London in late 1848. There she met and quickly married George Trafford Heald, a young army cornet (cavalry officer) with a recent inheritance. But the terms of her divorce from Thomas James did not permit either spouse's remarriage while the other was living, and the beleaguered newlyweds were forced to flee the country to escape a bigamy action brought by Heald's scandalised maiden aunt. The Healds resided for a time in France and Spain, but within two years the tempestuous relationship was in tatters. George survived a reported drowning in Lisbon in 1853, but died three years later from tuberculosis. Meanwhile, in 1851 Montez set off to make a new start in the United States, where she was surprisingly successful at first in rehabilitating her image.\nAmerican career.\nFrom 1851 to 1853, Montez performed as a dancer and actress in the eastern United States, one of her offerings being a play called \"Lola Montez in Bavaria\". In May 1853, she arrived in San Francisco, where her performances created a sensation and inspired a popular satire, \"Who's Got the Countess?\" She married Patrick Hull, a local newspaperman, in July and moved to Grass Valley, California, in August. Her marriage soon failed; a doctor named as co-respondent in the divorce suit brought against her was murdered shortly thereafter.\nMontez remained in Grass Valley for nearly two years. Her restored residence is California Historical Landmark No. 292. She inspired another aspiring young entertainer, Lotta Crabtree, whose parents ran a boarding house in Grass Valley. Montez, a neighbour, provided dancing lessons and encouraged Lotta's enthusiasm for performance.\nAustralia tour.\nIn June 1855, Montez left the U.S. to tour Australia and resume her career by entertaining miners at the gold diggings. She arrived in Sydney on 16 August 1855.\nHistorian Michael Cannon writes, \"in September 1855 she performed her erotic Spider Dance at the Theatre Royal in Melbourne, raising her skirts so high that the audience could see she wore no underclothing at all. Next day, \"The Argus\" thundered that her performance was 'utterly subversive to all ideas of public morality'. Respectable families ceased to attend the theatre, which began to show heavy losses.\"\nMontez earned further notoriety in Ballarat when, after reading a bad review of her performance in \"The Ballarat Times\", she attacked the editor, Henry Seekamp, with a whip. Although the \"Lola Montes Polka\" (composed by Albert Denning) is rumoured to have been inspired by this event, the song was published in 1855 and the incident with Seekamp occurred in February 1856. At Castlemaine in April 1856, she was \"rapturously encored\" after her Spider Dance in front of 400 diggers (including members of the Municipal Council who had adjourned their meeting early to attend the performance), but drew the wrath of the audience after insulting them following some mild heckling.\nShe departed for San Francisco on 22 May 1856. On the return voyage her manager was lost at sea after going overboard.\nLater life in the U.S..\nMontez failed in her attempts at a theatrical comeback in various U.S. cities. She arranged in 1857 to deliver a series of moral lectures in Britain and America written by Reverend Charles Chauncey Burr. She spent her last days in rescue work among women. In November 1859, \"The Philadelphia Press\" reported that Montez was:\nliving very quietly up town, and doesn't have much to do with the world's people. Some of her old friends, the Bohemians, now and then drop in to have a little chat with her, and though she talks beautifully of her present feelings and way of life, she generally, by way of parenthesis, takes out her little tobacco pouch and makes a cigarette or two for self and friend, and then falls back upon old times with decided gusto and effect. But she doesn't tell anybody what she's going to do.\nBurial.\nBy 1860, Montez was showing tertiary effects of syphilis, and her body began to waste away. She died at the age of 39 on 17 January 1861. She is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, where her tombstone erroneously lists her age at death as 42, reading \"Mrs. Eliza Gilbert | Died 17 January 1861 | \u00c6. 42\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Many musical genres tend to be associated with at least one or more of these instruments. \nOverview.\nSince the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for funk, R&amp;B, soul, rock, reggae, jazz fusion, heavy metal, country and pop. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in Dixieland and New Orleans-style jazz bands. Tuba players are sometimes conflated with bassists, due to the instrument being used to double a part for the double bass in early music recordings. Tubists who tend to fill the role of a bassist include Howard Johnson, Herbie Flowers and Steve Brown among others.\nDespite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some rock bands and bassists used a double bass, such as Lee Rocker of Stray Cats, Barenaked Ladies and Tiger Army. Larry Graham, Bernard Edwards, Mick Hogan, Andy Fraser, and Mel Schacher used an electric bass guitar. Some funk, R&amp;B and jazz, fusion groups use synth bass or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. Stevie Wonder, Bootsy Collins, and Bernie Worrell have used a synth bass. Some traditional jazz bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba; Bill Johnson and Steve Brown was one of the earliest double bassists in the New Orleans traditional jazz genre. In some jazz groups and jam bands, the basslines are played by a Hammond organ player, who uses the bass pedal keyboard or the lower manual for the low notes. Keyboard driven bass also occurs occasionally in rock bands, such as Atomic Rooster, and the Doors whose keyboardist Ray Manzarek notably used a Fender Rhodes piano bass with his left hand.\nElectric bass players.\nElectric bassists play the bass guitar. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the bass line outlines the harmony of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.). \nBass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each chord being used in a given song. In addition, pedal tones (repeated or sustained single notes), ostinatos, and bass riffs are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play chords (three or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially funk, R&amp;B, soul music, jazz, rock, Latin and heavy metal music. Phil Lesh, a bassist for the rock band Grateful Dead was known for treating bass lines as counterparts, rather than emphasizing the root note. Lemmy Kilmister, bassist for rock bands Hawkwind and Mot\u00f6rhead, was described by some musicians and writers to have a playing style reminiscent of an acoustic guitarist, sometimes using chords.\nDouble bass players.\nThe double bass is the standard bass instrument for classical music, bluegrass, rockabilly, and most genres of jazz.\nClassical double bass players.\nSee the List of contemporary classical double bass players.\nJazz double-bass players.\nSee the List of jazz bassists, which includes both double bass and electric bass players.\nPopular music double bass players.\nSee the List of double bassists in popular music, which includes blues, folk, country, etc.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The name was originally used by M\u0101ori in reference only to the North Island, with the whole country sometimes referred to as \"Aotearoa me Te Waipounamu,\" especially in the South Island. In the pre-European era, M\u0101ori did not have a collective name for the two islands.\nSeveral meanings for Aotearoa have been proposed; the most popular translation usually given is \"land of the long white cloud\", or variations thereof. This refers to the cloud formations which are believed to have helped early Polynesian navigators find the country in M\u0101ori oral tradition.\nBeginning in the late 20th century, \"Aotearoa\" has become widespread in the bilingual naming of national organisations and institutions. Since the 1990s, it has been customary for particular parties to sing the New Zealand national anthem, \"God Defend New Zealand\" (or \"Aotearoa\"), in both M\u0101ori and English, which further exposed the name to a wider audience.\nNew Zealand English speakers pronounce the word with various degrees of approximation to the original M\u0101ori pronunciation, from at one end of the spectrum (nativist) to at the other. Pronunciations documented in dictionaries of English include , , and .\nOrigin.\nThe original meaning of is not known. The word can be broken up as: ('cloud', 'dawn', 'daytime' or 'world'), ('white', 'clear' or 'bright') and ('long'). It can also be broken up as , the name of one of the migratory canoes that travelled to New Zealand, and ('long'). The most common literal translation is 'long white cloud', commonly lengthened to 'the land of the long white cloud'. Alternative translations include 'long bright world' or 'land of abiding day', possibly referring to New Zealand having longer summer days in comparison to those further north in the Pacific Ocean.\nMythology.\nIn some traditional stories, \"Aotearoa\" was the name of the canoe () of the explorer Kupe, and he named the land after it. Kupe's wife K\u016br\u0101marotini (in some versions, his daughter) was watching the horizon and called ('a cloud! a cloud!'). Other versions say the canoe was guided by a long white cloud in the course of the day and by a long bright cloud at night. On arrival, the sign of land to Kupe's crew was the long cloud hanging over it. The cloud caught Kupe's attention and he said \"Surely is a point of land\". Due to the cloud which greeted them, Kupe named the land \"Aotearoa\".\nUsage.\nIt is not known when M\u0101ori began incorporating the name into their oral lore. Beginning in 1845, George Grey, Governor of New Zealand, spent some years amassing information from M\u0101ori regarding their legends and histories. He translated it into English, and in 1855 published a book called \"Polynesian Mythology and Ancient Traditional History of the New Zealand Race\". In a reference to M\u0101ui, the culture hero, Grey's translation from the M\u0101ori reads as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Thus died this Maui we have spoken of; but before he died he had children, and sons were born to him; some of his descendants yet live in Hawaiki, some in \"Aotearoa\" (or in these islands); the greater part of his descendants remained in Hawaiki, but a few of them came here to \"Aotearoa\".\nThe use of \"Aotearoa\" to refer to the whole country is a post-colonial custom. Before the period of contact with Europeans, M\u0101ori did not have a commonly used name for the entire New Zealand archipelago. As late as the 1890s the name was used in reference to the North Island (\"Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui\") only; an example of this usage appeared in the first issue of \"Huia Tangata Kotahi\", a M\u0101ori-language newspaper published on 8 February 1893. It contained the dedication on the front page, \"He perehi tenei mo nga iwi Maori, katoa, o Aotearoa, mete Waipounamu\", meaning \"This is a publication for the M\u0101ori tribes of the North Island and the South Island\".\nAfter the adoption of the name \"New Zealand\" (anglicised from \"Nova Zeelandia\") by Europeans, one name used by M\u0101ori to denote the country as a whole was \"Niu T\u012breni\", a respelling of New Zealand derived from an approximate pronunciation.\nThe expanded meaning of \"Aotearoa\" among P\u0101keh\u0101 became commonplace in the late 19th century. \"Aotearoa\" was used for the name of New Zealand in the 1878 translation of \"God Defend New Zealand\", by Judge Thomas Henry Smith of the Native Land Court\u2014this translation is widely used today when the anthem is sung in M\u0101ori. Additionally, William Pember Reeves used \"Aotearoa\" to mean New Zealand in his history of the country published in 1898, \"The Long White Cloud: Ao Tea Roa\".\nSince the late 20th century \"Aotearoa\" is becoming widespread also in the bilingual names of national organisations, such as the National Library of New Zealand / Te Puna M\u0101tauranga o Aotearoa.\nThe New Zealand province of the Anglican Church is divided into three cultural streams or (Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia), with the Aotearoa covering M\u0101ori-speaking congregations within New Zealand.\nIn 2015, to celebrate Te Wiki o te Reo M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori Language Week), the Black Caps (the New Zealand national cricket team) played under the name \"Aotearoa\" for their first match against Zimbabwe.\nProposals for official use.\nA 2019 petition initiated by Danny Tahau Jobe for a referendum on whether the official name of New Zealand should change to include \"Aotearoa\" received 6,310 signatures.\nIn September 2021, Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori started a petition to change the name of New Zealand to \"Aotearoa\". The petition received 50,000 signatures in two days, and over 70,000 by early June 2022. On 2 June, the petition was submitted to Parliament's Petitions Committee. Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi argued that the proposed name change would recognise New Zealand's indigenous heritage and strengthen its identity as a Pacific country. Waititi objected to the idea of a referendum, claiming it would entrench the \"tyranny of the majority\". National Party leader Christopher Luxon stated that renaming New Zealand was a constitutional issue that would require a referendum. M\u0101ori Development Minister Willie Jackson expressed concerns that a potential name change would create branding issues for the country's tourism industry.\nA 1News\u2013Colmar Brunton poll in September 2021 found that 58% of respondents wanted to keep the name \"New Zealand\", 9% wanted to change the name to \"Aotearoa\", and 31% wanted the joint name of \"Aotearoa New Zealand\". A January 2023 \"Newshub\"-Reid Research poll showed a slight increase in support for the name \"Aotearoa\", with 36.2% wanting \"Aotearoa New Zealand\", 9.6% \"Aotearoa\" only, and 52% wanting to keep \"New Zealand\" only.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In Tongan and Niuean, \"tenifa\" refers to a large dangerous shark, as does the Samoan \"tanifa\"; the Tokelauan \"tanifa\" is a sea-monster that eats people. In most other Polynesian languages, the cognate words refer to sharks or simply fish. \nSome anthropologists have stated that the taniwha has \"analogues that appear within other Polynesian cosmologies\". \"Mo\u02bbo\" or \"Moho\", reptilian deities which can be seen in Hawaiian lore, strongly share characteristics with Taniwha as being both protector and harmful to men, shape-shifting, and so on.\nCharacteristics.\nAt sea, a taniwha often appears as a whale or a large shark such as southern right whale or whale shark; compare the M\u0101ori name for the great white shark: \"mang\u014d-taniwha\". In inland waters, they may still be of whale-like dimensions, but look more like a gecko or a tuatara, having a row of spines along the back. Other taniwha appear as a floating log, which behaves in a disconcerting way. Some can tunnel through the earth, uprooting trees in the process. Legends credit certain taniwha with creating harbours by carving out a channel to the ocean. Wellington's harbour, Te Whanganui-a-Tara, was reputedly carved out by two taniwha. The petrified remains of one of them turned into a hill overlooking the city. Lake Waikaremoana in Te Urewera Ranges area of Wairoa District was also reputedly carved out by taniwha. Other taniwha allegedly caused landslides beside lakes or rivers.\nTaniwha can either be male or female. The taniwha \u0100raiteuru is said to have arrived in New Zealand with the early voyaging canoes and her eleven sons are credited with creating the various branches of the Hokianga Harbour.\nAs guardians.\nMost taniwha have associations with tribal groups; each group may have a taniwha of its own. The taniwha Ureia, depicted on this page, was associated as a guardian with the M\u0101ori people of the Hauraki district. Many well-known taniwha arrived from Hawaiki, often as guardians of a particular ancestral canoe. Once arrived in Aotearoa, they took on a protective role over the descendants of the crew of the canoe they had accompanied. The origins of many other taniwha are unknown.\nWhen accorded appropriate respect, taniwha usually acted well towards their people. Taniwha acted as guardians by warning of the approach of enemies, communicating the information via a priest who was a medium; sometimes the taniwha saved people from drowning. Because they lived in dangerous or dark and gloomy places, the people were careful to placate the taniwha with appropriate offerings if they needed to be in the vicinity or to pass by its lair. These offerings were often of a green twig, accompanied by a fitting incantation. In harvest time, the first k\u016bmara (sweet potato) or the first taro was often presented to the taniwha.\nArising from the role of taniwha as tribal guardians, the word can also refer in a complimentary way to chiefs. The famous saying of the Tainui people of the Waikato district plays on this double meaning: \"Waikato taniwha rau\" (Waikato of a hundred chiefs).\nWiti Ihimaera, author of \"The Whale Rider\", says that he has a female \"kaitiaki\" (guardian) taniwha named Hine Te Ariki who lives in the Waipaoa River.\nAs notorious monsters.\nIn their role as guardians, taniwha were vigilant to ensure that the people respected the restrictions imposed by tapu. They made certain that any violations of tapu were punished. Taniwha were especially dangerous to people from other tribes. There are many legends of battles with taniwha, both on land and at sea. Often these conflicts took place soon after the settlement of New Zealand, generally after a taniwha had attacked and eaten a person from a tribe that it had no connection with. Always, the humans manage to outwit and defeat the taniwha. Many of these taniwha are described as beings of lizard-like form, and some of the stories say the huge beasts were cut up and eaten by the slayers. When Hotu-puku, a taniwha of the Rotorua district, was killed, his stomach was cut open to reveal a number of bodies of men, women, and children, whole and still undigested, as well as various body parts. The taniwha had swallowed all that his victims had been carrying, and his stomach also contained weapons of various kinds, darts, greenstone ornaments, shark's teeth, flax clothing, and an assortment of fur and feather cloaks of the highest quality.\nMany taniwha were killers but in this particular instance the taniwha Kaiwhare was eventually tamed by T\u0101mure. T\u0101mure lived at Hauraki and was understood to have a magical mere/pounamu with powers to defeat taniwha. The Manukau people then called for T\u0101mure to help kill the taniwha. T\u0101mure and Kaiwhare wrestled and T\u0101mure clubbed the taniwha over the head. Although he was unable to kill it, his actions tamed the taniwha. Kaiwhare still lives in the waters but now lives on k\u014dura (crayfish) and wheke (octopus).\nNg\u0101rara Huarau is a taniwha known from the myths of several groups of M\u0101ori in the northern South Island. In most versions of the story, the monster eats several villagers and captures a young woman whom he keeps in a cave by the sea. Ng\u0101rara Huarau is eventually enticed to come to the local village for a feast, where he is ambushed and killed by the villagers. In each version of the story, upon his death the monster's tail detaches itself and is thrown far away into a body of water. In the version of Wainui Bay, and the T\u0101kaka M\u0101ori, the tail lands in the pool at the base of Wainui Falls.\nRelationships with people.\nSometimes, a person who had dealings with taniwha during their lifetime might turn into a taniwha after they died. This happened to Te Tahi-o-te-rangi, who had been a medium for the taniwha, and had been rescued at one time by one of the creatures. T\u016bheita, an early ancestor who drowned, became a taniwha despite the fact that he had no prior dealings with the mythical beasts. Sometimes relationships are formed between humans and taniwha. Hine-k\u014drako was a female taniwha who married a human man, and Pania was a woman from the sea who married a human and gave birth to a taniwha.\nIn the legend \"The Taniwha of Kaipara\" three sisters went out to pick berries. One of the sisters was particularly beautiful. The taniwha caused havoc on their walk back and the sisters fled. The taniwha caught the sisters one by one, trying to capture the beautiful one. On succeeding, he then took her back to his cave. Many years passed and the woman bore the taniwha six sons, with three like their father and three fully human. She educated all her sons and in particular taught her human sons the art of war, helping them to fashion and use weapons. The human sons then killed their three taniwha brothers, and eventually their father. They all went back to their homes.\nModern usage.\n\"In more recent years, taniwha have featured prominently in New Zealand news broadcasts\u2014due to taniwha spirits being referenced in both court cases and in various legal negotiations.\" Beliefs in the existence of taniwha have a potential for controversy but there has been a change in the way they are viewed; rather than being derided for holding up development and infrastructure projects they are becoming recognised as indicators of natural hazards.\nIn 2002, Ng\u0101ti Naho, a M\u0101ori iwi (tribe) from the Meremere district, successfully ensured that part of the country's major highway, State Highway 1, be rerouted in order to protect the abode of their legendary protector. This taniwha was said to have the appearance of large white eel, and Ng\u0101ti Naho argued that it must not be removed but rather move on of its own accord; to remove the taniwha would be to invite trouble. Television New Zealand reported in November 2002 that Transit New Zealand had negotiated a deal with Ng\u0101ti Naho under which \"concessions have been put in place to ensure that the taniwha are respected\". Some like the journalist Brian Rudman have criticised such deals in respect of 'secretive taniwha which rise up from swamps and river beds every now and again, demanding a tithe from Transit New Zealand'.\nIn 2001 \"another notable instance of taniwha featuring heavily within the public eye was that of a proposed Northland prison site at Ngawha which was eventually granted approval through the courts.\"\nM\u0101ori academic Ranginui Walker said that in the modern age a taniwha was the manifestation of a coping mechanism for some M\u0101ori. It did not mean there actually was a creature lurking in the water, it was just their way of indicating they were troubled by some incident or event.\nIn 2021, the 28th Minister of Foreign Affairs of New Zealand Nanaia Mahuta characterised China\u2013New Zealand relations as the relationship between a taniwha and a dragon.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was one of the principal figures of the period known as the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration.\nBorn in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland, Shackleton and his Anglo-Irish family moved to Sydenham in suburban south London when he was ten. Shackleton's first experience of the polar regions was as third officer on Captain Robert Falcon Scott's \"Discovery\" Expedition of 1901\u200d\u2013\u200d1904, from which he was sent home early on health grounds, after he and his companions Scott and Edward Adrian Wilson set a new southern record by marching to latitude 82\u00b0\u00a0S. During the \"Nimrod\" Expedition of 1907\u200d\u2013\u200d1909, he and three companions established a new record Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b023\u2032\u00a0S, only 97\u00a0geographical miles (112\u00a0statute miles or 180\u00a0kilometres) from the South Pole, the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. On returning home, Shackleton was knighted for his achievements by King Edward\u00a0VII.\nAfter the race to the South Pole ended in December 1911, with Roald Amundsen's conquest, Shackleton turned his attention to the crossing of Antarctica from sea to sea, via the pole. To this end, he made preparations for what became the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914\u200d\u2013\u200d1917. The expedition was struck by disaster when its ship, , became trapped in pack ice and finally sank in the Weddell Sea off Antarctica on 21\u00a0November 1915. The crew escaped by camping on the sea ice until it disintegrated, then by launching the lifeboats to reach Elephant Island and ultimately the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, enduring a stormy ocean voyage of in Shackleton's most famous exploit. He returned to the Antarctic with the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition in 1921 but died of a heart attack while his ship was moored in South Georgia. At his wife's request, he remained on the island and was buried in Grytviken cemetery. The wreck of \"Endurance\" was discovered just over a century after Shackleton's death.\nAway from his expeditions, Shackleton's life was generally restless and unfulfilled. In his search for rapid pathways to wealth and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was \"rediscovered\", and he became a role model for leadership in extreme circumstances. In his 1956 address to the British Science Association, one of Shackleton's contemporaries, Sir Raymond Priestley, said: \"Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency[,] but[,] when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton\", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to his 1922 memoir \"The Worst Journey in the World\". In 2002, Shackleton was voted eleventh in a BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.\nEarly years.\nChildhood and education.\nShackleton was born on 15 February 1874, in Kilkea, County Kildare, Ireland. His father, Henry Shackleton, tried to enter the British Army, but his poor health prevented him from doing so; instead he became a farmer and settled in Kilkea. The Shackleton family are of English origin, specifically from West Yorkshire. Shackleton's father was descended from Abraham Shackleton, an English Quaker who moved to Ireland in 1726 and started a school in Ballitore, County Kildare. Shackleton's mother, Henrietta Letitia Sophia Gavan, was descended from the Fitzmaurice family. Ernest was the second of ten children and the first of two sons; the second, Frank, achieved notoriety as a suspect, later exonerated, in the 1907 theft of the so-called Irish Crown Jewels, which have never been recovered.\nIn 1880, when Ernest was six, his father gave up his life as a landowner to study medicine at Trinity College Dublin, moving his family to the city. Four years later, they left Ireland and moved to Sydenham in suburban London. This was partly in search of better professional prospects for the newly qualified doctor, but another factor may have been unease about the family's Anglo-Irish ancestry, following the 1882 assassination by Irish nationalists of Lord Frederick Cavendish, the British Chief Secretary for Ireland. However, Shackleton took lifelong pride in his Irish roots and frequently declared that he was \"an Irishman\".\nFrom early childhood, Shackleton was a voracious reader, a pursuit which sparked in him a passion for adventure. He was schooled by a governess until the age of eleven, when he began at Fir Lodge Preparatory School in West Hill, Dulwich, in southeast London. At the age of thirteen, he entered Dulwich College. As a youngster, Shackleton did not particularly distinguish himself as a scholar, and was said to be \"bored\" by his studies.\nHe was quoted later as saying: \"I never learned much geography at school\u00a0[...] Literature, too, consisted in the dissection, the parsing, the analysing of certain passages from our great poets and prose-writers\u00a0... teachers should be very careful not to spoil [their pupils'] taste for poetry for all time by making it a task and an imposition.\" In his final term at the school, he was still able to achieve fifth place in his class of thirty-one.\nMerchant Navy officer.\nShackleton's restlessness at school was such that he was allowed to leave at sixteen and go to sea. One option was a Royal Navy officer cadetship in the at Dartmouth, but this was too expensive, and Shackleton passed the upper age limit of fourteen and a half in 1888. Alternatives were the mercantile marine cadet ships \"Worcester\" and , or an apprenticeship \"before the mast\" on a sailing vessel. This third option was chosen. His father was able to secure him a berth with the North Western Shipping Company, aboard the square-rigged sailing ship \"Hoghton Tower\".\nOver the next four years at sea, Shackleton learned his trade and visited many parts of the world, forming a variety of acquaintances and learning to associate with people from many different walks of life. In August 1894, he passed his examination for second mate and accepted a post as third officer on a tramp steamer of the Welsh Shire Line. Two years later, he had obtained his first mate's ticket, and in 1898, he was certified as a master mariner, qualifying him to command a British ship anywhere in the world.\nIn 1900, he joined Union-Castle Line, the regular mail and passenger carrier between Britain and South Africa. One of his shipmates recorded that Shackleton was \"a departure from our usual type of young officer\", content with his own company though not aloof, \"spouting lines from Keats or Browning\", a mixture of sensitivity and aggression but not unsympathetic. Following the outbreak of the Boer War in 1899, Shackleton transferred to the troopship \"Tintagel Castle\" where, in March 1900, he met Cedric Longstaff, an army lieutenant whose father Llewellyn\u00a0W. Longstaff was the main financial backer of the British National Antarctic Expedition then being organised in London.\nShackleton used his acquaintance with the son to obtain an interview with Longstaff senior, with a view to obtaining a place on the expedition. Impressed by Shackleton's keenness, Longstaff recommended him to Sir Clements Markham, the expedition's overlord, making it clear that he wanted Shackleton accepted. On 17\u00a0February 1901, his appointment as third officer to the expedition's ship was confirmed; on 4\u00a0June he was commissioned into the Royal Navy, with the rank of sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. Although officially on leave from Union-Castle, this was in fact the end of Shackleton's Merchant Navy service.\n\"Discovery\" Expedition, 1901\u20131903.\nThe British National Antarctic Expedition\u2014known as the \"Discovery\" Expedition after the ship \"Discovery\"\u2014was the brainchild of Sir Clements Markham, president of the Royal Geographical Society, and had been many years in preparation. Led by Robert Falcon Scott, a Royal Navy torpedo lieutenant lately promoted commander, the expedition had objectives that included scientific and geographical discovery.\nAlthough \"Discovery\" was not a Royal Navy unit, Scott required the crew, officers and scientific staff to submit to the conditions of the Naval Discipline Act, meaning that the ship and expedition were run on Royal Navy lines. Shackleton accepted this approach, even though his own background and instincts favoured a different, more informal style of leadership. His particular duties were listed as: \"In charge of sea-water analysis. Ward-room caterer. In charge of the holds, stores, and provisions\u00a0[...] He also arranges the entertainments.\"\n\"Discovery\" departed from London's East India Docks on 31\u00a0July 1901, arriving at the Antarctic coast, via Madeira, Cape Town and New Zealand, on 9\u00a0January 1902. After landing, Shackleton took part in an experimental balloon flight on 4\u00a0February. He also participated, with the scientists Edward\u00a0A. Wilson and Hartley\u00a0T. Ferrar, in the first sledging trip from the expedition's winter quarters in McMurdo Sound, a journey which established a safe route on to the Great Ice Barrier. Confined to the iced-in \"Discovery\" throughout the Antarctic winter of 1902, Shackleton edited the expedition's magazine the \"South Polar Times\", a regular publication that kept everyone onboard entertained. According to steward Clarence Hare, Shackleton was \"the most popular of the officers among the crew, being a good mixer\", though claims that this represented an unofficial rivalry to Scott's leadership are unsupported.\nScott chose Shackleton to accompany Wilson and himself on the expedition's southern journey, a march southwards to achieve the highest possible latitude in the direction of the South Pole. This was not a serious attempt on the Pole, although the attainment of a high latitude was of great importance to Scott, and the inclusion of Shackleton indicated a high degree of personal trust. The party set out on 2\u00a0November 1902. Scott later wrote that the march was \"a combination of success and failure\". They reached a record Farthest South latitude of 82\u00b017\u2032\u00a0S, beating the previous record established in 1900 by Carsten Borchgrevink.\nThe journey was marred by the poor performance of the dogs, who rapidly fell sick after their food had become tainted. All 22 dogs died during the march. The three men all suffered at times from snow blindness, frostbite and, ultimately, scurvy. On the return journey, Shackleton had by his own admission \"broken down\" and could no longer carry out his share of the work. He later denied Scott's claim in \"The Voyage of the Discovery\", that he had been carried on the sledge. He was in a severely weakened condition; Wilson's diary entry for 14\u00a0January 1903 reads: \"Shackleton has been anything but up to the mark, and today he is decidedly worse, very short-winded, and coughing constantly, with more serious symptoms which need not be detailed here, but which are of no small consequence a hundred and sixty miles from the ship, and full loads to pull all the way.\"\nThe party finally arrived back at the ship on 3\u00a0February 1903. After a medical examination that proved inconclusive, Scott decided to send Shackleton home on the relief ship , which had arrived in McMurdo Sound in January. Scott wrote: \"He ought not to risk further hardships in his present state of health.\" There is conjecture that Scott's motive for removing him was resentment of Shackleton's popularity, and that ill-health was used as an excuse to get rid of him.\nYears after the deaths of Scott, Wilson and Shackleton, the expedition's second-in-command Albert Armitage claimed that there had been a falling-out on the southern journey, and that Scott had told the ship's doctor that \"[if] he does not go back sick he will go back in disgrace\". There is no corroboration of Armitage's story. Shackleton and Scott remained on friendly terms, at least until the publication of Scott's account of the southern journey in \"The Voyage of the Discovery\". While in public they appeared mutually respectful and cordial, according to biographer Roland Huntford, Shackleton's attitude to Scott turned to \"smouldering scorn and dislike\"; salvage of wounded pride required \"a return to the Antarctic and an attempt to outdo Scott\".\nShore work, 1903\u20131907.\nAfter a period of convalescence in New Zealand, Shackleton returned to England via San Francisco and New York. As the first significant person to return from the Antarctic, he found that he was in demand; in particular, the Admiralty wished to consult him about its further proposals for the rescue of \"Discovery\". With Sir Clements Markham's blessing, he accepted a temporary post assisting the outfitting of the \"Terra Nova\" for the second \"Discovery\" relief operation, but turned down the offer to sail with her as chief officer. He also assisted in the equipping of the Argentine , which was being fitted out for the relief of the stranded Swedish Antarctic Expedition under Otto Nordenskj\u00f6ld.\nIn search of more permanent employment in 1903, Shackleton applied for a regular commission in the Royal Navy via the back-door route of the Supplementary List. Despite the sponsorship of Markham and William Huggins, the president of the Royal Society, his application was unsuccessful because the list was closed. The Admiralty suggested that he could be promoted to Lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve if he qualified, but he chose to resign his RNR commission the following year. Instead, he became a journalist, working for the \"Royal Magazine\", but he found this unsatisfactory. He was then offered, and accepted, the secretaryship of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society (RSGS), a post which he took up on 11\u00a0January 1904. Three months later, on 9\u00a0April, he married Emily Dorman, with whom he had three children: Raymond, Cecily, and Edward, himself an explorer and later a politician.\nIn 1905, Shackleton became a shareholder in a speculative company that aimed to make a fortune transporting Russian troops home from the Far East. Despite his assurances to Emily that \"we are practically sure of the contract\", nothing came of this scheme. He also ventured into politics, unsuccessfully standing in the 1906 General Election as the Liberal Unionist Party's candidate for Dundee constituency in opposition to Irish Home Rule. In the meantime, he had taken a job with wealthy Clydeside industrialist William Beardmore (later Lord Invernairn), with a roving commission which involved interviewing prospective clients and entertaining Beardmore's business friends. He was, by this time, making no secret of his ambition to return to Antarctica at the head of his own expedition.\nBeardmore was sufficiently impressed with Shackleton to offer financial support, but other donations proved hard to come by. Nevertheless, in February 1907, Shackleton presented to the Royal Geographical Society his plans for an Antarctic expedition, the details of which, under the name British Antarctic Expedition, were published in the RGS newsletter, \"Geographical Journal\". The aim was the conquest of both the geographical South Pole and the South Magnetic Pole. He then worked hard to persuade others of his wealthy friends and acquaintances to contribute, including Sir Philip Lee Brocklehurst, who subscribed \u00a32,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023) to secure a place on the expedition; author Campbell Mackellar; and Guinness baron Lord Iveagh, whose contribution was secured less than two weeks before the departure of the expedition ship \"Nimrod\".\nOn 4 August 1907, Shackleton was appointed a Member of the Royal Victorian Order, 4th Class (MVO; the present-day grade of lieutenant).\n\"Nimrod\" Expedition, 1907\u20131909.\nOn 7 August 1907, the set sail from England for the start of the British Antarctic Expedition, reaching New Zealand at the end of November. After some final preparations, the expedition set off from Lyttelton Harbour on 1\u00a0January 1908, heading for the Antarctic. Shackleton had originally planned to use the old \"Discovery\" base in McMurdo Sound to launch his attempts on the South Pole and South Magnetic Pole, but before leaving England, he had been pressured into giving Scott an undertaking not to base himself in the McMurdo area, which Scott was claiming as his own field of work. Shackleton reluctantly agreed to seek out winter quarters at either the Barrier Inlet\u2014which he had briefly visited in 1902 on \"Discovery\"\u2014or King Edward\u00a0VII Land.\nTo conserve coal, the ship was towed by the steamer \"Koonya\" to the Antarctic ice, after Shackleton had persuaded the New Zealand government and the Union Steamship Company to share the cost. In accordance with Shackleton's promise to Scott, the ship headed for the eastern sector of the Great Ice Barrier, arriving there on 21\u00a0January 1908. They discovered that the Barrier Inlet had expanded to form a large bay, containing hundreds of whales, and they immediately christened it the \"Bay of Whales\".\nThe ice conditions were found to be unstable, making it impossible to establish a safe base at the Barrier Inlet, and an extended search for an anchorage at King Edward\u00a0VII Land proved equally futile. Shackleton was forced to break the undertaking he had made to Scott, and the \"Nimrod\" set sail for McMurdo Sound; according to second officer Arthur Harbord, this decision was \"dictated by common sense\" in view of the difficulties of ice pressure, coal shortage and the lack of any alternative base known to be close at hand. The ship arrived at McMurdo Sound on 29\u00a0January, but was stopped by ice north of \"Discovery\"'s old base at Hut Point. After considerable weather delays, a base was eventually established at Cape Royds, about north of Hut Point. The party was in high spirits, despite the difficult conditions; Shackleton's ability to bond with his crew kept the party happy and focused.\nOn 29 October 1908, Shackleton and three companions\u2014Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams\u2014set off on the \"Great Southern Journey\", as Wild called it. On 9\u00a0January 1909, they reached a new Farthest South latitude of 88\u00b023\u2032\u00a0S, a point from the Pole. En route, the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier, named after Shackleton's patron, and the four men became the first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race to avoid starvation, and they were restricted to half-rations for much of the duration. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: \"All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me\". The party arrived back at Hut Point just in time to catch the ship.\nThe other main accomplishments of the British Antarctic Expedition included the first ascent of Mount Erebus, and the discovery of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, attained by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay on 16\u00a0January 1909. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his account of the expedition, \"The Heart of the Antarctic\". His wife Emily later recorded: \"The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole, was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, as far as I am concerned,' and we left it at that.\"\nIn 1910, Shackleton made a series of three recordings using an Edison phonograph, in which he briefly described the expedition. In 2010, several (mostly intact) cases of whisky and brandy that had been left behind in 1909 were recovered for analysis by a distilling company. A revival of the vintage formula for the particular brands found was offered for sale, with a portion of the proceeds donated to the New Zealand Antarctic Heritage Trust which had discovered the lost spirits.\nBetween expeditions, 1909\u20131914.\nPublic hero.\nOn Shackleton's return home, public honours were quickly forthcoming. He was received by King Edward\u00a0VII on 10\u00a0July 1909, and raised to a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. He received a knighthood in the King's Birthday Honours list in November, becoming \"Sir Ernest Shackleton\". The RGS awarded him a gold medal; a proposal to present him with a smaller medal than that earlier awarded to Captain Scott was not acted on. Each member of the \"Nimrod\" Expedition shore party received a silver Polar Medal on 23\u00a0November, Shackleton himself receiving a clasp to attach to his earlier medal. He was also appointed a Younger Brother of Trinity House, a significant honour for British mariners.\nBesides the official honours bestowed on Shackleton, his Antarctic feats were greeted in Britain with great enthusiasm. Proposing a toast to Shackleton at a lunch given in his honour by the Royal Societies Club, Lord Halsbury, a former Lord Chancellor, said: \"When one remembers what he had gone through, one does not believe in the supposed degeneration of the British race. One does not believe that we have lost all sense of admiration for courage [and] endurance\". The heroism was also claimed by Ireland: the Dublin \"Evening Telegraph's\" headline read \"South Pole Almost Reached by an Irishman\", while the \"Dublin Express\" spoke of the \"qualities which were his heritage as an Irishman\".\nShackleton's fellow polar explorers expressed their admiration; Roald Amundsen wrote, in a letter to RGS Secretary John Scott Keltie, that \"the English nation has by this deed of Shackleton's won a victory [...] which never can be surpassed.\" Fridtjof Nansen sent an effusive private letter to Shackleton's wife, praising the \"unique expedition, which has been such a complete success in every respect.\" The reality was that the expedition had left Shackleton deeply in debt, unable to meet the financial guarantees he had given to backers. Despite his efforts, it required government action, in the form of a grant of \u00a320,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023) to clear the most pressing obligations, and it is likely that many of his debts were written off.\nBiding time.\nIn the period immediately after his return, Shackleton engaged in a strenuous schedule of public appearances, lectures and social engagements. He then sought to cash in on his celebrity by making a fortune in the world of business. Among the ventures that he hoped to promote were a tobacco company, a scheme for selling special postage stamps to collectors\u2014overprinted \"King Edward\u00a0VII Land\", based on his appointment as Antarctic postmaster by the New Zealand authorities\u2014and the development of a Hungarian mining concession he had acquired near the city of Nagybanya, now part of Romania.\nAs none of these enterprises prospered, Shackleton's main source of income was his earnings from lecture tours. He still harboured thoughts of returning south, even though in September 1910, having recently moved with his family to Sheringham in Norfolk, he wrote to Emily: \"I am never again going South and I have thought it all out and my place is at home now.\" He had been in discussions with Douglas Mawson about a scientific expedition to the Antarctic coast between Cape Adare and Gaussberg, and had written to the RGS about this in February 1910.\nAny future resumption by Shackleton of his quest for the South Pole depended on the results of Scott's \"Terra Nova\" Expedition, which had sailed from Cardiff on 15\u00a0June 1910. By early 1912, the world was aware that the pole had been conquered by the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, but the fate of Scott's expedition was not then known. Shackleton's mind turned to a project that had been announced, and then abandoned, by the British explorer William Speirs Bruce, for a continental crossing via the South Pole, starting from a landing point in the Weddell Sea and ending in McMurdo Sound. Bruce had failed to acquire financial backing, and was happy for Shackleton to adopt his plans, which were similar to those being followed by the German explorer Wilhelm Filchner who had left Bremerhaven in May 1911; in December 1912, the news arrived from South Georgia that Filchner's expedition had failed. In Shackleton's own words, the transcontinental journey was the \"one great main object of Antarctic journeyings\" remaining, and now open to him.\nImperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, 1914\u20131917.\nPreparations.\nIn December 1913, Shackleton published details of his new expedition, grandly titled the \"Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition\". There is a legend that Shackleton posted an advertisement emphasising the hardship and danger of the planned voyage, so that he could better narrow down the selection of candidates for his expedition, but no record of any such advertisement has survived and its existence is considered doubtful. Two ships were to be employed: \"Endurance\" would carry the main party into the Weddell Sea, aiming for Vahsel Bay from where a team of six, led by Shackleton, would begin the crossing of the continent; meanwhile, a second ship, the \"Aurora\", would take a supporting party under Captain Aeneas Mackintosh to McMurdo Sound on the far side of the continent. This party would be tasked with laying supply depots across the Great Ice Barrier as far as the Beardmore Glacier, the depots holding the food and fuel required to enable Shackleton's party to complete their journey of across the continent.\nShackleton used his considerable fund-raising skills to support the expedition, which was financed largely by private donations, although the British government gave \u00a310,000 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023). Scottish jute magnate Sir James Caird donated \u00a324,000, Midlands industrialist Frank Dudley Docker gave \u00a310,000, and tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave an undisclosed but reportedly \"generous\" sum. There was considerable public interest; Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications to join his expedition.\nAt times, his interviewing and selection methods seemed eccentric; believing that character and temperament were as important as technical ability, his questions were unconventional. Physicist Reginald James was asked if he could sing; others were accepted on sight because Shackleton liked the look of them, or after the briefest of interrogations. He loosened some of the traditional hierarchies to promote camaraderie, such as distributing the ship's chores equally among officers, scientists and able seamen. He made a point of socialising with his crew members every evening after dinner, leading sing-alongs, jokes and games. He finally selected a crew of fifty-six; shared equally, twenty-eight men on each ship.\nDespite the outbreak of the First World War on 3\u00a0August 1914, \"Endurance\" was directed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, to \"proceed\", and left British waters on 8\u00a0August. Shackleton delayed his own departure until 27\u00a0September, meeting the ship in Buenos Aires. On setting sail for South Georgia at the end of October, he sent a cablegram to the \"Daily Chronicle\", conveying the patriotic message: \"We hope in our small way to add victories in science and discovery to that certain victory which our nation will achieve in the cause of honour and liberty.\"\nCrew.\nShackleton led the expedition, Captain Frank Worsley commanded the \"Endurance\" and Captain Aeneas Mackintosh the \"Aurora\". On the \"Endurance\", the second-in-command was the experienced explorer Frank Wild, and the first officer was Lionel Greenstreet. The meteorologist was Leonard Hussey, who was also an able banjo player. Surgeon James McIlroy was head of the scientific staff, which included geologist James Wordie. Alexander Macklin was the second of the two surgeons, also in charge of keeping the 70\u00a0dogs healthy. Tom Crean was in more immediate charge as head dog-handler. Other crew included navigator Hubert Hudson, physicist Reginald James, a carpenter Harry McNish, and a biologist named Robert Clark.\nOf later independent fame was the expedition's official photographer Frank Hurley, known on this mission for his perilous shots. Perce Blackborow was a nineteen-year-old Welsh sailor who had stowed away on the ship after being refused a job; although angered by this, Shackleton realised it was too late to turn back by the time the situation was discovered, so Blackborow was allowed to join the crew and assigned to the ship's galley.\nThere was a (male) cat on board, named Mrs Chippy, that belonged to the carpenter Harry McNish. Mrs Chippy was shot when the \"Endurance\" sank, due to the belief that he would not have survived the ordeal that followed.\nLoss of \"Endurance\".\n\"Endurance\" departed from South Georgia for the Weddell Sea on 5\u00a0December 1914, heading for Vahsel Bay. As the ship moved southward navigating in ice, she encountered first-year ice, which slowed progress. Deep in the Weddell Sea, conditions gradually grew worse until, on 19\u00a0January 1915, \"Endurance\" became frozen fast in an ice floe.\nOn 24 February, realising that they would be trapped until the following spring, Shackleton ordered the abandonment of the ship's routine and her conversion to a winter station. \"Endurance\" drifted slowly northward with the ice through the following months. When spring arrived in September, the breaking of the ice and its later movements put extreme pressure on the ship's hull.\nShackleton had been hoping that the ship, when released from the ice, could work her way back towards Vahsel Bay, but his hopes were dashed on 24\u00a0October when water began pouring in. After a few days, with the position at 69\u00b05\u2032\u00a0S, 51\u00b030\u2032\u00a0W, he gave the order to abandon ship, saying, \"She's going down!\"; and men, provisions and equipment were transferred to camps on the ice. On 21\u00a0November 1915, the wreck of \"Endurance\" finally slipped beneath the surface.\nFor almost two months, Shackleton and his party camped on a large, flat floe, hoping that it would drift towards Paulet Island, approximately away, where it was known that stores were cached. After failed attempts to march across the ice to this island, Shackleton decided to set up another more permanent camp (Patience Camp) on another floe, and trust to the drift of the ice to take them towards a safe landing. By 17\u00a0March, their ice camp was within of Paulet Island; however, separated by impassable ice, they were unable to reach it. On 9\u00a0April, their ice floe broke into two, and Shackleton ordered the crew into the lifeboats and to head for the nearest land.\nAfter five harrowing days at sea, the exhausted men landed their three lifeboats at Elephant Island, from where the \"Endurance\" had sunk. This was the first time they had set foot on solid ground for 497\u00a0days. Shackleton's concern for his men was such that he gave his mittens to photographer Frank Hurley, who had lost his own mittens during the boat journey. Shackleton suffered frostbitten fingers as a result.\nOpen-boat journey.\nElephant Island was an inhospitable place, far from any shipping routes. Rescue by means of a chance discovery was very unlikely, so Shackleton decided to risk an open-boat journey to the South Georgia whaling stations where he knew help would be available. The strongest of the tiny lifeboats, christened after the expedition's chief sponsor, was chosen for the trip. Ship's carpenter Harry McNish made various improvements, which included raising the sides, strengthening the keel, building a makeshift deck of wood and canvas, and sealing the work with oil paint and seal blood.\nShackleton chose five companions for the journey: the ship's captain Frank Worsley, who would be responsible for navigation; Tom Crean, who had \"begged to go\"; two strong sailors in John Vincent and Timothy McCarthy; and McNish. The carpenter had earlier clashed with Shackleton when the party was stranded on the ice but, while not forgetting his earlier insubordination, Shackleton recognised McNish's value for this particular job.\nShackleton insisted on packing only enough supplies to last for four weeks, knowing that if they failed to reach South Georgia within that time, the boat and its crew would be lost. The \"James Caird\" was launched on 24\u00a0April 1916; during the next fifteen days, it sailed through the waters of the southern ocean, at the mercy of the stormy seas and in peril of capsizing. Thanks to Worsley's navigational skills, the cliffs of South Georgia came into sight on 8\u00a0May, but hurricane-force winds prevented any possibility of landing. The party was forced to ride out the storm offshore, in continual danger of being dashed against the rocks. They later learned that the same storm had sunk a 500-ton steamer bound for South Georgia from Buenos Aires.\nThe next day, they were able to land on the unoccupied southern shore, and a period of rest and recuperation followed. Rather than risking another sea journey to reach the whaling stations on the northern coast, Shackleton decided to attempt a land crossing of the island. Although it is likely that Norwegian whalers had already crossed the island at other points on ski, no one had previously attempted this particular route. For their journey, the men were only equipped with boots they had adapted for climbing by pushing screws into the soles, a carpenter's adze, and of rope. Leaving McNish, Vincent and McCarthy at the landing point on South Georgia, Shackleton travelled with Worsley and Crean over of dangerous mountainous terrain for 36\u00a0hours, reaching the whaling station at Stromness on 20\u00a0May.\nRescue.\nShackleton immediately sent a boat to pick up the three men from the other side of South Georgia Island, while he set to work organising the rescue of those left behind on Elephant Island. His first three attempts were foiled by sea ice, which blocked the approaches to the island. He appealed to the Chilean government and was offered the use of the , a small seagoing tug from the Chilean Navy. \"Yelcho\", commanded by Captain Luis Pardo, and the British whaler \"Southern Sky\", reached Elephant Island on 30\u00a0August 1916, at which point the men had been isolated there for four and a half months. Shackleton quickly evacuated all 22\u00a0men. The party was taken on \"Yelcho\" first to Punta Arenas and after some days to Valpara\u00edso in Chile, where crowds warmly welcomed them back to civilisation.\nAt the same time that the \"Endurance\" was suffering these perils, the \"Aurora\" (the expedition supporting component) also suffered misfortune. The remaining men of the Ross Sea party had been stranded at Cape Evans in McMurdo Sound when the \"Aurora\" was blown from its anchorage and driven out to sea, unable to return. After a drift of many months, the ship returned to New Zealand. Shackleton travelled there to join \"Aurora\", and sailed with her to rescue the Ross Sea party. Said party had successfully completed its depot-laying mission, despite many hardships, during which three lives had been lost, including party commander Aeneas Mackintosh.\nFirst World War.\nEurope was in the midst of the First World War when Shackleton returned to England in May 1917. Suffering from a heart condition, made worse by the fatigue of his arduous journeys, and too old to be conscripted, he nevertheless volunteered for the British Army. He repeatedly requested posting to the front in France, and was by now drinking heavily.\nIn October 1917, Shackleton was sent to Buenos Aires to boost British propaganda in South America. Unqualified as a diplomat, he was unsuccessful in persuading Argentina and Chile to enter the war on the Allied side, and he returned home in April 1918. He was then briefly involved in a mission to Spitzbergen, to establish a British presence there under the guise of a mining operation. On the way, he was taken ill in Troms\u00f8, possibly with a heart attack. He was then appointed to a military expedition to Murmansk, which obliged him to return home again before departing for northern Russia.\nRussian Civil War.\nShackleton was specially appointed a temporary major on 22\u00a0July 1918. From October 1918, he served with the North Russia Expeditionary Force in the Russian Civil War under the command of Major-General Edmund Ironside, with the role of advising on the equipment and training of British forces in arctic conditions.\nFor his \"valuable services rendered in connection with Military Operations in North Russia\", Shackleton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 King's Birthday Honours, and he was also mentioned in despatches by General Ironside. Returning to England in early March 1919, he was full of plans for the economic development of Northern Russia. In the midst of seeking capital, his plans foundered when Northern Russia fell to Bolshevik control. Shackleton was finally discharged from the army in October 1919, retaining his rank of major.\nFinal expedition and death.\nShackleton returned to the lecture circuit and in December 1919 he published his own account of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, titled \"South\". In 1920, tired of public speaking, he began to consider the possibility of a last expedition. He thought seriously of going to the Beaufort Sea area of the Arctic, a largely unexplored region, and raised some interest in this idea from the Canadian government. With funds supplied by former schoolfriend John Quiller Rowett, Shackleton acquired a 125-ton Norwegian sealer, named \"Foca I\", which he renamed .\nThe plan changed; the destination became the Antarctic, and the project was defined by Shackleton as an \"oceanographic and sub-antarctic-expedition\". The goals of the venture were imprecise, but a circumnavigation of the Antarctic continent and investigation of some \"lost\" sub-Antarctic islands, such as Tuanaki, were mentioned as objectives. Rowett agreed to finance the entire expedition, which became known as the Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition.\nOn 16\u00a0September 1921, Shackleton recorded a farewell address on a sound-on-film system created by Harry Grindell Matthews, who claimed it was the first \"talking picture\" ever made. The expedition left England on 24\u00a0September 1921. Although some of Shackleton's former crew members had not received all of their pay from the \"Endurance\" expedition, many of them signed on with their erstwhile \"Boss\".\nWhen the party arrived in Rio de Janeiro, Shackleton suffered a suspected heart attack. He refused to have a proper medical examination, and \"Quest\" continued south, arriving at South Georgia on 4\u00a0January 1922. In the early hours of the next morning, Shackleton summoned the expedition's physician, Alexander Macklin, to his cabin complaining of back pains and other discomfort. According to Macklin's own account, he told Shackleton that he had been overdoing things and should try to \"lead a more regular life\", to which Shackleton answered: \"You are always wanting me to give up things, what is it I ought to give up?\" Macklin replied: \"Chiefly alcohol, Boss.\" A few moments later, at 2:50\u00a0a.m. on 5\u00a0January 1922, Shackleton suffered a fatal heart attack.\nAfter carrying out the post-mortem, Macklin concluded that the cause of death was atheroma of the coronary arteries exacerbated by \"overstrain during a period of debility\". Contemporary study of diaries kept by Eric Marshall, medical officer to the 1907\u20131909 expedition, suggests that Shackleton suffered from an atrial septal defect (\"hole in the heart\"), a congenital heart defect, which may have been a cause of his health problems.\nLeonard Hussey, a veteran of the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, offered to accompany Shackleton's body back to Britain, but while he was in Montevideo en route to England, a message was received from Emily Shackleton asking that her husband be buried in South Georgia. Hussey returned to South Georgia with the body on the steamer , and on 5\u00a0March 1922, Shackleton was buried in the Grytviken cemetery, after a short service in the Lutheran church, with Edward Binnie officiating. Macklin wrote in his diary: \"I think this is as the boss would have had it himself, standing lonely on an island far from civilization, surrounded by a stormy tempestuous sea, and in the vicinity of one of his greatest exploits.\"\nShackleton's will was proven in London on 12\u00a0May 1922. He died heavily in debt, his small estate consisting of personal effects to the value of \u00a3556 (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023). Lady Shackleton died in 1936, having survived her husband by fourteen years.\nOn 27 November 2011, the ashes of Frank Wild were interred on the right-hand side of Shackleton's gravesite in Grytviken. The inscription on the rough-hewn granite block set to mark the spot reads: \"Frank Wild 1873\u200d\u2013\u200d1939, Shackleton's right-hand man.\"\nIn June 2024, wreck hunters found \"Quest\", the vessel on which Shackleton made his final voyage. She was found on the seafloor off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada by a team led by the Royal Canadian Geographical Society (RCGS). The ship was found \"intact\" lying at a depth of .\nLegacy.\nEarly.\nBefore the return of Shackleton's body to South Georgia, a memorial service with full military honours took place at Holy Trinity Church, Montevideo, and a service was held on 2\u00a0March 1922 at St\u00a0Paul's Cathedral, London, at which King George\u00a0V and other members of the royal family were represented. Within a year, the first biography was published: \"The Life of Sir Ernest Shackleton\" by Hugh Robert Mill. As well as being a tribute to the explorer, this book was a practical effort to assist his family; Shackleton had died some \u00a340,000 in debt (equivalent to \u00a3 in 2023). A further initiative was the formation of a Shackleton Memorial Fund, which was used to assist with his children's education and to support his mother.\nShackleton's death marked the end of the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, a period of discovery characterised by journeys of geographical and scientific exploration in a largely unknown continent without any of the benefits of modern travel methods or radio communication. None of his voyages achieved its primary objective; over the ensuing decades, Shackleton's status as a polar hero was generally outshone by that of Scott, whose polar party had by 1925 been commemorated on more than thirty monuments in Britain alone, including stained glass windows, statues, busts and memorial tablets. A statue of Shackleton designed by Charles Sargeant Jagger was unveiled at the Kensington headquarters of the RGS in 1932, but public memorials to him were relatively few. The printed word gave much more attention to Scott\u2014a forty-page booklet titled \"Shackleton in the Antarctic\", published in 1943 by OUP as part of a \"Great Exploits\" series, is described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as \"a lone example of a popular literary treatment of Shackleton in a sea of similar treatments of Scott\". This disparity continued into the 1950s.\nIn the preface to his 1922 book \"The Worst Journey in the World\", Apsley Cherry-Garrard (who had accompanied Scott on the Terra Nova Expedition) wrote: \"For a joint scientific and geographical piece of organisation, give me Scott; for a Winter Journey, Wilson; for a dash to the Pole and nothing else, Amundsen: and if I am in the devil of a hole and want to get out of it, give me Shackleton every time.\" This statement was paraphrased by one of Shackleton's contemporaries, Sir Raymond Priestley, in his 1956 address to the British Science Association, thus: \"Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.\"\nLater.\nIn April 1959, Alfred Lansing's \"Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage\" was published. This was the first of a number of books about Shackleton that began to appear, showing him in a highly positive light. At the same time, attitudes towards Scott were gradually changing as a more critical note was sounded in the literature, culminating in Roland Huntford's 1979 treatment of him in his dual biography \"Scott and Amundsen\", described by Barczewski as a \"devastating attack\". This negative picture of Scott became accepted as the popular truth, as the kind of heroism that he represented fell victim to the cultural shifts of the late twentieth century. Within a few years, Scott was thoroughly overtaken in public esteem by Shackleton, whose popularity surged while that of his erstwhile rival declined. In 2002, in a BBC poll conducted to determine the \"100 Greatest Britons\", Shackleton was ranked 11th while Scott was down in 54th place.\nMargaret Morrell and Stephanie Capparell presented Shackleton as a model for corporate leadership in their 2001 book \"Shackleton's Way: Leadership Lessons from the Great Antarctic Explorer\". They wrote: \"Shackleton resonates with executives in today's business world. His people-centred approach to leadership can be a guide to anyone in a position of authority\". Other management writers soon followed this lead, using Shackleton as an exemplar for bringing order from chaos. Nancy Koehn argued that, in spite of Shackleton's mistakes, financial problems and narcissism, he developed the capability to be successful.\nThe Centre for Leadership Studies at the University of Exeter offers a course on Shackleton, which also features in the management education programmes of several American universities. In Boston, a \"Shackleton School\" was set up on \"Outward Bound\" principles, with the motto \"The Journey is Everything\". Shackleton has also been cited as a model leader by the US Navy, and in a textbook on Congressional leadership, Peter\u00a0L. Steinke calls Shackleton the archetype of the \"nonanxious leader\" whose \"calm, reflective demeanor becomes the antibiotic warning of the toxicity of reactive behaviour\". In 2001, the Athy Heritage Centre-Museum (now the Shackleton Museum), Athy, County Kildare, Ireland, established the Ernest Shackleton Autumn School, which is held annually, to honour the memory of Ernest Shackleton.\nIn 1993, Trevor Potts re-enacted the boat journey from Elephant Island to South Georgia in honour of Shackleton, totally unsupported, in a replica of the \"James Caird\".\nAn asteroid discovered by Swiss amateur astronomer Michel Ory in March 2005 was named \"289586 Shackleton\" in his memory.\nAt a Christie's auction in London in 2011, a biscuit that Shackleton gave \"a starving fellow traveller\" on the 1907\u200d\u2013\u200d1909 \"Nimrod\" Expedition sold for \u00a31,250. That same year, on the date of what would have been Shackleton's 137th birthday, Google honoured him with a Google Doodle.\nIn January 2013, a joint British-Australian team set out to duplicate Shackleton's 1916 trip across the Southern Ocean. Led by explorer and environmental scientist Tim Jarvis, the team was assembled at the request of Alexandra Shackleton, Sir Ernest's granddaughter, who felt the trip would honour her grandfather's legacy. This team became the first to replicate the so-called \"double crossing\", sailing from Elephant Island to South Georgia and crossing the South Georgian mountains from King Haakon Bay (where Shackleton had landed nearly 100 years prior) to Stromness. The expedition very carefully matched legacy conditions, using a replica of the \"James Caird\" (named for the project's patron: the \"Alexandra Shackleton\"), period clothing (by Burberry), replica rations (both in calorific content and rough constitution), period navigational aids, and a Thomas Mercer chronometer just as Shackleton had used. This expedition was made into a documentary film, screening as \"Chasing Shackleton\" on PBS in the US, and \"\" elsewhere on the Discovery Channel.\nA genus of lichen-forming fungi in the Teloschistaceae family was published in 2013 as \"Shackletonia\" by botanists S\u00f8chting, Fr\u00f6d\u00e9n &amp; Arup. In October 2015, Shackleton's decorations and medals were auctioned at Christie's, raising a total of \u00a3585,000. Shackleton featured on a series of UK postage stamps issued by the Royal Mail in January 2016 to mark the centenary of the \"Endurance\" expedition. In August 2016, a statue of Shackleton by Mark Richards was erected in Athy, sponsored by Kildare County Council.\nIn February 2024 a memorial plaque to Shackleton sculpted by Will Davies was unveiled in the south cloister of Westminster Abbey by Anne, Princess Royal.\nLego included Shackleton's lifeboat as a Gift With Purchase for anyone who bought the Endurance between a certain timeframe. Included is a minifigure of Shackleton and photographer Frank Hurley.\nIn the arts and popular media.\nExpedition member and cinematographer Frank Hurley took many photographs and much footage of the expedition. His silent documentary film \"In the Grip of the Polar Pack Ice\" was released in 1919. The film was restored by the British Film Institute in 1996, and digitally-remastered version released in 2022, as \"South: Sir Ernest Shackleton's Glorious Epic of the Antarctic\".\nIn 1983, the BBC produced a four-part miniseries, \"Shackleton\", starring David Schofield in the title role and David Rodigan as Frank Wild. Originally broadcast on BBC Two, the series was released on DVD in March 2017. Shackleton also appeared in the first episode of the 1985 Central Television serial \"The Last Place on Earth\", in which he was portrayed by James Aubrey.\nA photography exhibition titled \"The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic Expedition\" was open to the public for six months from April to October 1999 at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. It included artefacts, film footage and diaries from the 1914 expedition, as well as a chronological display of more than 150 photographs taken by Frank Hurley, all specially reprinted from the original negatives.\nIn 2002, Channel 4 in the UK produced \"Shackleton\", a TV serial depicting the 1914 expedition with Kenneth Branagh in the title role. Broadcast in the US on the A&amp;E Network, it won two Emmy Awards.\nThe musical play \"Ernest Shackleton Loves Me\" by Val Vigoda and Joe DiPietro made its debut in 2017 at the Tony Kiser Theater, an off-Broadway venue in New York City. Blended with a parallel story of a struggling composer, the play retells the adventure of \"Endurance\" in detail, incorporating photos and videos of the journey.\nAwards and decorations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited bibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for being a key expedition leader during the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, along with Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott, and Sir Ernest Shackleton (with whom he undertook the \"Nimrod\" Expedition in 1907\u20131909). However most of his geological work was undertaken in South Australia, in particular the Precambrian rocks of the Flinders Ranges.\nMawson was born in England and was brought to Australia as an infant. He completed degrees in mining engineering and geology at the University of Sydney, after which he was appointed lecturer in petrology and mineralogy at the University of Adelaide in 1906. From 1903 onwards he undertook significant geological exploration, including an expedition to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) in 1903, and later in the Flinders Ranges and far north-east of South Australia and over the border near Broken Hill in New South Wales. He was interested in the commercial applications of geology, in particular the radioactive minerals being used in medical applications in the early 1900s. He identified and first described the mineral davidite in 1906, and later became an expert in the geochemistry of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Much of his later work was focused on the Precambrian rocks Adelaide Superbasin (which included the Flinders and Barrier Ranges), where there are significant fossil beds showing the beginnings of animal life on Earth.\nMawson's first experience in the Antarctic came as a member of Shackleton's \"Nimrod\" Expedition (1907\u20131909), alongside his geologist lecturer and mentor Edgeworth David. They were part of a group which became the first to climb Mount Erebus in March 1908. Mawson, David, and Alistair Mackay formed the expedition's northern party, which later, setting off in October 1908, became the first people to attain the South magnetic pole. After his participation in Shackleton's expedition, Mawson became the principal instigator and leader of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (1911\u20131914). The expedition explored thousands of kilometres of previously unexplored regions, collected geological and botanical samples, and made important scientific observations. Mawson was the sole survivor of the three-man Far Eastern Party in 1912\u20133, which travelled across the Mertz and Ninnis Glaciers, named after his two deceased companions. Their deaths forced him to travel alone for over a month to return to the expedition's main base, which became known as Mawson's Huts. Mawson's account of the expedition was published in 1915 as \"The Home of the Blizzard\".\nMawson was knighted in 1914, and during the second half of World War I worked as a non-combatant with the British and Russian militaries. He returned to the University of Adelaide in 1919 and became a full professor in 1921, contributing much to Australian geology.\nHe returned to the Antarctic as the leader of the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (aka BANZARE, 1929\u20131931), which led to a territorial claim in the form of the Australian Antarctic Territory. The two long summer voyages were also noteworthy for the major oceanographic as well as terrestrial collections. \nMawson is commemorated by numerous landmarks, and from 1984 to 1996 appeared on the Australian $100 note.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life and education.\nDouglas Mawson was born on 5 May 1882, the second son of Robert Ellis Mawson and Margaret Ann Moore (who was from the Isle of Man). He was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire, but was under the age of two when his family emigrated to Australia and settled at Rooty Hill, now in the western suburbs of Sydney. Elder brother William was around two years older. \nIn 1893 the family moved to the inner-Sydney suburb of Glebe, where they lived in a double-storey Victorian house at 28 Toxteth Road. The home was nominated for a Blue Plaque in 2021. Douglas first attended Plumpton Public School (then called Woodstock, and later known as Plumpton Primary School) in Plumpton, an outer western suburb of Sydney, along with his brother William. They both attended Forest Lodge Superior Public School in Glebe, and then Fort Street Model School in Observatory Hill, Sydney, both graduating in 1898, despite the age difference. It was at Fort Street that Mawson developed his interest in geology.\nHe entered the University of Sydney in March 1899, aged just 16, the same year as his brother. Douglas enrolled in a degree in mining engineering. His studies covered a number of subjects over the three-year degree, obtaining first class honours in geology and mineralogy in his second year, and winning a prize in petrology. He graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering degree in mining and metallurgy on 19 April 1902 with second-class honours. Even before graduating, he was appointed as a junior demonstrator in chemistry, with the approval of chemistry professor Archibald Liversidge, and with geologist Edgeworth David as his referee. Both men became major influences in his geological career.\nHe returned to study at Sydney University in 1904, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree with first-class honours in geology and mineralogy on 6 May 1905. By the time he graduated, he had already completed fieldwork for two papers, first in Mittagong, New South Wales, and then the New Hebrides (Vanuatu).\nIn 1909, Mawson was awarded a Doctor of Science (DSc) degree at the University of Adelaide, for his thesis about the geology of the Barrier Ranges, in the Olary area in South Australia and over the border in New South Wales.\nCareer.\nEarly work.\nIn 1903 Mawson published a geological paper on Mittagong, New South Wales, with fellow science student and friend Thomas Griffith Taylor, based on joint field trips done over the course of around 18 months, and building on data created by the Geological Survey of New South Wales. Their study focused on igneous rocks, in particular their chemical composition. The paper was read at the Royal Society of New South Wales in October 1903 by Edgeworth David.\nMawson's first major independent geological work occurred when he was appointed geologist by Edgeworth David to an expedition to the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) from April to September 1903. He travelled there with medical student W. T. Quaife, who acted as the expedition's biologist, aboard the \"Ysabel\", under the auspices of the British Deputy Commissioner of the New Hebrides, Captain Ernest Rason. HMS \"Archer\" was also used on the trip. The South Australian Museum holds many of Mawson's original field notes and some photographs from this trip, as well as a bibliography compiled by Mawson before setting out. The first results of the expedition were presented on 11 January 1904 at a meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Dunedin on Mawson's behalf by David, who was then president of the AAAS. Mawson's more detailed report, \"The Geology of the New Hebrides\", published in the \"Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales\" in December 1905, was one of the first major geological works of Melanesia. The report included geological maps of the islands of Efate and Santo.\nIn 1904, Mawson and chemist/physicist T. H. Laby were the first to identify radium-bearing ore in Australia, in samples of monazite collected from the Pilbara in Western Australia. They also examined other samples collected from across New South Wales, including the Barrier Ranges, not far from Olary, South Australia, where uranium was identified a couple of years later. Mawson built an electroscope based on the design of C. T. R. Wilson in Sydney University engineering laboratory to test samples from their field trips. Professor Edgeworth David made the formal presentation of their paper describing their findings to the Royal Society of New South Wales on 5 October 1904 on the men's behalf.\nIn 1905 Mawson became a lecturer in petrology and mineralogy at the University of Adelaide. During this time, thanks to the free rail pass given to him by the government for the purpose of geological research, he travelled by train around the state of South Australia (SA). By 1907, he had been to Kangaroo Island, the Flinders Ranges, to the southern tips of the Yorke and Eyre Peninsulas, as well as an area between the small town in the far east of SA, Olary, and Broken Hill, over the border in New South Wales. He explored the Olary-Broken Hill area on horseback and by motorbike. He also accompanied groups of students on field trips, and had to plan transport and provisions for hot days and some very cold nights in the desert. He wrote extensive diaries detailing his trips in the semi-arid areas, which have been transcribed by volunteers at the South Australian Museum. In 1906, Government Geologist H. Y. L. Brown concluded that Mawson was undertaking commercial activities in conjunction with his academic activities at Elder's Rock, and withdrew his rail pass for a while.\nMawson was always interested in commercial applications of geology. After the discovery of uranium materials at near Olary, a \"uranium rush\" followed, in order to extract the mineral for commercial applications, at that time. Commercial interest in uranium rose after Marie Curie's research and the application of radioactivity in medicine. Mawson exhibited a collection of radioactive minerals, including carnotite from Olary, at a meeting of the Royal Society of South Australia on 7 August 1906. On 4 September of that year, Mawson identified and first described the mineral davidite, which contains titanium and uranium, at the Olary site, which he named Radium Hill. The site was developed by the Radium Hill Company, but closed in 1914 with the start of World War I. Mawson maintained an interest in Radium Hill throughout his life, in particular davidite. It was the first major find of radioactive ore in Australia.\nAfter pastoralist and prospector W. B. Greenwood sent rocks that he had found near Mount Painter, in the northern Flinders Ranges, in October/November 1910 for analysis, Mawson identified the mineral torbernite, a secondary mineral that occurs in uranium-bearing rocks. Greenwood had previously sent samples to the government in 1899, a year after radium had been discovered by Marie and Pierre Curie in France. However, government geologist Henry Y. L. Brown was away on leave when the specimens arrived, and they subsequently went missing. After Greenwood sent more samples in 1910, Brown was dismissive of their value, but Mawson, having recently visited Marie Curie in Paris, and been urged to look for radium, thought the samples were worth analysis. He used a gold-leaf electroscope given to him by Curie for the purpose (one of two she had made). Mawson visited the area and wrote a report which was published in newspapers in late November 1910. His diary of his trip to Mount Painter and Mount Gee dated October 1910 shows that his expedition members included the \"well-known prospector still in the Govt Service\" Harry Fabian, who met him at Mt Serle with camels; W. B. Greenwood; his son Gordon Arthur \"Smiler\" Greenwood; and (for at least some of the trip) H. Y. L. Brown. The group travelled to Mt Painter, and visited a number of sites, including the Mount Rose Mine, Mueller Hill, Yankaninna, and the Wheal Turner Mine. In his overview written on the back of the diary, Mawson notes a number of different types of rock of the Cambrian and Precambrian before describing the torbanite, carnotite, and uranium, as possibly \"the most extensive uraniferous lode formation in the world\". They also looked at corundum at Yudnamutana as well as a much larger strike of the same mineral on Mount Painter, which \"may turn out enormous\", and studied the rocks at Mt Gee and Radium Ridge. Mawson took numerous photographs of the sites and expedition members.\nMawson became involved in the establishment of a development company, the Radium Extraction Company of South Australia Ltd (in which Greenwood also bought shares). He was optimistic about the value of the mine, but sold his shares in the company in 1911 in order to help finance the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, and in 1917 the company was liquidated after not achieving success. Mawson maintained a lifelong interest in uranium, which included the publication of a paper on uranium deposits in South Australia in 1944.\nIn March 1906, he wrote his first report on the geology of South Australia, and specifically of the Flinders Ranges, which he later revisited many times. The short handwritten report was submitted to the state government in March 1906, based on his first visit to the Flinders Ranges with Walter Howchin and Thomas Griffith Taylor in February 1906. It was titled \"Notes on the Geological Features of the Beltana District\", and was not published until 2007. It described the geology of the area around Beltana, and the abandoned Ajax Copper Mine (now the heritage-listed and world-famous Ajax Mine Fossil Reef), located near Puttapa, a pastoral lease around north of Beltana. Mawson's report is a technical description of the mine and its activity, and also discusses the geology of the copper mineralisation and its relationship with the limestone bearing the Archaeocyatha (marine sponge) fossils (about which Taylor later wrote a major monograph). The report shows his abiding interest in the Cambrian right from the beginning of his career. He later returned to do major research on the Cambrian in the Flinders, building on Howchin's work, publishing important papers in the 1930s.\nAlso in 1906, while in Adelaide, he published a substantial and detailed study focused on the syenites of the Bowral Quarries in New South Wales. This was a follow-up to his earlier work with Taylor at Mittagong (1903). In January 1907, Mawson was responsible for organising the geological section of a meeting of the AAAS in Adelaide, and presented a paper about the Barrier Ranges, near Broken Hill. As part of the conference, as reported by Howchin, Mawson participated, along with Howchin, T. Griffith Taylor, Walter Woolnough, and 16 others, in a five-day excursion dubbed \"Scientific Trip of Governor Macquarie to Spencer Gulf\". The ship visited Kangaroo Island as well as Neptune, Williams, and Thistle Islands, proceeded to Port Lincoln and then returned to Port Adelaide after stopping off at Wedge Island. Later that year, Mawson visited the Australian Alps with T. Griffith Taylor and W.T. Quaife, who had accompanied him on his New Hebridean expedition two years prior.\nMawson's early work shows two major interests: an academic interest in ancient glacial rocks, and the commercial possibilities of mining certain minerals. The focus of his early geological work was the Precambrian rocks of the Barrier Ranges, which run from the northern Flinders Ranges in South Australia northwards through Broken Hill. There are several types of rock along the ranges, with varying degrees of mineralisation. He identified two groups: an older Archaean (\"Willyama\") Series, and a newer, Proterozoic (\"Torrowangee\") Series. His work in this area was reported in his 1909 D.Sc. thesis, and he subsequently published \"Geological investigations in the Broken Hill area\", in 1912, co-authored by English geologist Walter Howchin. His work on the glacial sediments of the Precambrian Age in SA and around Broken Hill led him to want to investigate the glaciers of Antarctica, and his later trips there, studying how they move and deposit sediment, increased his understanding of how the rocks formed in SA millions of years earlier.\nUntil 1913 he was largely occupied with Antarctic expeditions, and only returned to geological research in Australia in 1922. He did complete his doctorate after returning from Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition and completing his studies in the Broken Hill area, and was awarded a D.Sc. at the University of Adelaide in 1909 for his thesis about the geology of the Barrier Ranges.\nWorld War I.\nMawson served in a scientific capacity from May 1916 in the British Ministry of Munitions, first as embarkation officer for shipments of explosives and poison gas from Britain to Russia. He then worked for a Russian military agency, reporting on British production of high explosives with the aim of increasing Russian production. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, he was transferred to the Commission Internationale de Ravitaillement, as a major.\nLater career.\nReturning to the University of Adelaide in 1919, after the retirement of Howchin in 1920, Mawson was promoted to the professorship of geology and mineralogy in 1921, a position held until his retirement in 1952. He built an effective teaching and research department, with students always involved in field work.\nAlong with Cecil Madigan and their students, Mawson made significant contribution to the knowledge about the Cambrian. During these 30 years, much of his research was focused on the Adelaide Superbasin (formerly known as Adelaide Geosyncline and Adelaide Rift Complex) of Precambrian rocks, especially in the northern Flinders Ranges. He showed that glacial beds extended for , and also that glacial conditions existed on and off throughout the Proterozoic period. During this time he did a lot of field work with students, sometimes using horse and cart or camels as transport. In August 1924, Mawson undertook fieldwork as part of his teaching and research programme in the northern Flinders Ranges, which led the discovery of an extensive Cambrian outcrop near Mt McKinlay in the Gammon Ranges.\nHis geological excursions and research into the Cambrian were interrupted by work and travel relating to another polar expedition, BANZARE, which took place from 1929 to 1931. After completing the work relating to BANZARE, Mawson once again took up and expanded his research into the Cambrian in the late 1930s, with some assistance from his students. He published studies in 1937, 1938, and 1939, and a sketch map in 1942. In his studies, he included measured sections of parts of the Flinders Ranges, showing the Cambrian layers of rock.\nHe was also interested in the geochemistry of igneous and metamorphic rocks, the geological significance of algae, and other topics. His reputation meant that specialists around the world were happy to provide assistance in his descriptions of rocks and fossils which he had collected both in Australia and Antarctica.\nAnother area of interest for Mawson was petroleum geology, in particular researching coorongite, a substance first found in 1852 at Salt Creek on the Coorong, and other sapropelic deposits in the area. Some observers thought that this was formed by oil seepage, owing to its viscous nature and combustibility, but it was determined by scientists that coorongite had its origin in a type of alga called \"Botryococcus braunii\". Mawson's diaries show that he did extensive field work in the Coorong and at Lake Albert (the first geologist to visit the latter site) in January 1938, February 1940, and January 1941, although only published one study in 1938. His personal correspondence also shows an interest in oil. Mawson's collection at the South Australian Museum also includes a sample of crude oil from Oil Creek, near Titusville, Pennsylvania, United States, although there is no indication of how he came by it. This oil, discovered by Edwin Drake, was the first discovery of unconventional crude oil in the world, and the first commercially successful oil well in the US when it opened in 1859. After his retirement from teaching in 1952, in 1954 Mawson was appointed as an inaugural director of the new oil company Santos (South Australia and Northern Territory Oil Search), but resigned very soon afterwards due to ill-health, becoming an honorary consultant to the company.\nAntarctic expeditions.\n\"Nimrod\" Expedition (1907\u20131909).\nWhile still undertaking his doctorate, Mawson joined Ernest Shackleton's \"Nimrod\" Expedition (1907\u20131909; also known as the Third British Antarctic Expedition) to the Antarctic, as surveyor, cartographer, and magnetician. He was keen to learn more about glaciation and its effect on rocks, because his earlier studies in South Australia had looked at the largest Precambrian glacial deposits yet recorded anywhere. Originally intending to stay only for the duration of the ship's presence in the first summer, instead both he and his mentor, Edgeworth David, stayed an extra year. In doing so they became, in the company of Alistair Mackay and a support group of three men, the first to climb the summit of Mount Erebus (the second-highest volcanic peak in Antarctica, at ) and to trek to the South magnetic pole locality, which at that time was over land. On the return journey to \"Nimrod\", Mawson fell into a crevasse and had to be rescued.\nDuring their stay, they also wrote, illustrated and printed the book \"Aurora Australis\". Mawson contributed with the science fiction short story \"Bathybia\".\nAustralasian Antarctic Expedition (1911\u20131913).\nMawson turned down an invitation to join Robert Falcon Scott's \"Terra Nova\" Expedition in 1910, as Scott showed no interest in Mawson doing scientific research on the expedition. Instead, Australian geologist Thomas Griffith Taylor went with Scott. Mawson chose to lead his own expedition, the Australasian Antarctic Expedition (AAE), to George V Land and Ad\u00e9lie Land, the sector of the Antarctic continent immediately south of Australia, which at the time was almost entirely unexplored. The objectives were to carry out geographical exploration and scientific studies, including a visit to the South magnetic pole. Mawson raised the necessary funds in a year, from British and Australian Governments, and from commercial backers interested in mining and whaling. Over nearly three years, the group mapped the Antarctic coastline, explored other nearby locations such as the subantarctic Macquarie Island, as well as voyaging inland for over , collecting geological and scientific data. Mawson had meant to return in February 1913, but owing to a series of mishaps during his Far Eastern Party expedition and the loss of his companions, missed the returning boat, and was forced to spend another year there.\nThe expedition used the ship commanded by Captain John King Davis, who led an extensive programme of marine science from the ship. It departed from Hobart on 2 December 1911, landed at Cape Denison (named after Hugh Denison, a major backer of the expedition) on Commonwealth Bay on 8 January 1912, and established the Main Base. A second camp was located to the west on the ice shelf in Queen Mary Land. Cape Denison proved to be unrelentingly windy; the average wind speed for the entire year was about , with some winds approaching . They built a hut (now one of Mawson's Huts) on the rocky cape and wintered through nearly constant blizzards. In his book published after the expedition, \"The Home of the Blizzard\" (1915), Mawson talked of \"Herculean gusts\" on 24 May 1912, which he learned afterwards \"approached two hundred miles per hour\". These katabatic winds can reach around , and led Mawson to dub Cape Denison \"the windiest place on Earth\". \nMawson wanted to do aerial exploration and brought the first \"air tractor\" to Antarctica. The aircraft, a Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane, was to be flown by Francis Howard Bickerton. When it was damaged in Australia shortly before the expedition departed, plans were changed, and it was to be used only as a tractor on skis. However, the engine did not operate well in the cold, and it was removed and returned to Vickers in England. The aircraft fuselage itself was abandoned. On 1 January 2009, fragments of it were rediscovered by the Mawson's Huts Foundation, which works on restoring and conserving the original huts.\nMawson's exploration program was carried out by five parties from the Main Base and two from the Western Base. Mawson himself was part of a three-man sledging team, the Far Eastern Party, with Xavier Mertz and Lieutenant Belgrave Ninnis, who headed east on 10 November 1912, to survey George V Land. After five weeks of excellent progress mapping the coastline and collecting geological samples, the party was crossing the Ninnis Glacier east of the main base. Mertz was skiing and Mawson was on his sledge with his weight dispersed, but Ninnis was jogging beside the second sled. Ninnis fell through a crevasse, and his body weight is likely to have breached the snow bridge covering it. The six best dogs, most of the party's rations, their tent, and other essential supplies disappeared into the massive crevasse. Mertz and Mawson spotted one dead and one injured dog on a ledge below them, but Ninnis was never seen again. \nAfter a brief service, Mawson and Mertz turned back immediately. They had one week's provisions for two men and no dog food, but plenty of fuel and a Primus stove. Their lack of provisions forced them to use their remaining sledge dogs to feed the other dogs and themselves: There was a quick deterioration in the men's physical condition during this journey. Both men suffered dizziness; nausea; abdominal pain; irrationality; mucosal fissuring; skin, hair, and nail loss; and the yellowing of eyes and skin. Mertz began to deteriorate rapidly, with diarrhoea and madness, eventually falling into a coma and dying on 8 January 1913. It was unknown at the time that high levels of vitamin A are toxic to humans, causing liver damage, and that husky liver contains extremely high levels of Vitamin A. Mawson himself also became very ill, with the soles of his feet becoming detached.\nMawson cut his remaining sledge in half to make it lighter and easier to single man-haul, taking on the barest minimum equipment with him. The half sledge is displayed in the South Australian Museum.\nHe continued the final alone and slowly, back to Main Base. When he finally made it back to Cape Denison, the ship \"Aurora\" had left only a few hours before. It was recalled by wireless communication, only to have bad weather thwart the rescue effort. Mawson and six men who had remained behind to look for him wintered a second year until December 1913. In Mawson's book \"Home of the Blizzard\", he describes his experiences. His party, and those at the Western Base, had explored large areas of the Antarctic coast, describing its geology, biology and meteorology, and more closely defining the location of the South magnetic pole. They had covered around . \nUpon his return Mawson gave public lectures, showing photographs and relating relating stories of the AAE, including at Adelaide Town Hall on 9 September 1914. He also edited the 22 volumes of the \"A.A.E. Scientific Reports\", the publication of which was finally completed .\nThe Australian Government has published a website called \"Home of the Blizzard: The Australasian Antarctic Experience\".\nBANZARE (1929\u201331).\nWith the support of both the Australian National Research Council and the Australian Government, resulting from the Imperial Conference 1926, Mawson led the British Australian and New Zealand Antarctic Research Expedition (BANZARE) of 1929-30 and 1930\u201331. This expedition used the ship \"Discovery\" and did not establish land bases, instead focusing on data relating to geology, magnetism, zoology, and botany. BANZARE resulted in the formation of the Australian Antarctic Territory in 1936, by the enactment of the \"Australian Antarctic Territory Acceptance Act 1933\".\nThe expedition also carried out extensive work in marine science, with the examination and analysis of specimens carried out over the following 50 years by specialists all over the world, culminating in the 13-volume \"B.A.N.Z.A.R.E. Scientific Reports\", with the last only published in 1975. The narrative of the BANZARE was written by Archibald Grenfell Price, working from Mawson's papers, and was published commercially by Angus &amp; Robertson as \"The winning of Australian Antarctica; Mawson's B.A.N.Z.A.R.E. voyages, 1929-31\" in 1962.\nOther roles and activities.\nMawson was Honorary Curator of Minerals for the South Australian Museum from 1907 to 1958, and also chair of the South Australian Museum Board of Governors from 1951 to 1958.\nIn 1915, he represented the University of Adelaide at a conference convened by prime minister Billy Hughes in order to establish the Advisory Council of Science and Industry, which was the predecessor of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). In early 1916 Mawson participated in the first executive meetings of the new body, in which its charter and operational procedures were established. \nOn 21 August 1919, Mawson was a founding member, representing the science of geography, of the Australasian Research Council, based in Sydney. The council was formalised by the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) and renamed the Australian National Research Council (ANRC) in July 1921, and eventually dissolved in 1955, its functions taken over by the Australian Academy of Science. He was a petitioner for the academy in 1953, a founding fellow 1954\u20131958, and council member from 1954.\nFrom the end of World War I until 1923, he was a committee member of the Australian War Museum (later the Australian War Memorial).\nHe was a member of the council, and later president of the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia from 1924 to 1925.\nIn 1920 he was elected president of Section E (Geology) the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science. From 1932 to 1937 he was president of the association, by then renamed Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science (ANZAAS).\nIn 1924-1925 and again in 1945 Mawson was president of the Royal Society of South Australia.\nIn 1939 he became a foreign member of the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography. \nAfter World War II ended in 1945, Mawson promoted the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions, and was a member of the Australian Antarctic Executive Planning Committee until his death.\nHis other interests included conservation, farming, and forestry. His wife wrote that he was happiest planting trees. Along with artist Hans Heysen, he was in 1920 a founding member of the South Australian Forest League, which was dedicated to protecting forests and valuable trees, and encouraging the planting of native trees. Mawson owned and worked a farm called \"Harewood\" at Meadows, and was a founding director of S.A. Hardwoods Pty Ltd. He established a mill near Kuitpo Forest. A painting by artist Sam Leach of the farm, based on his childhood memories and assisted by AI, was a finalist in the Wynne Prize in 2022.\nHe also advocated for decimalisation and supported strict regulation of the whaling industry. When he returned from Antarctica in 1914, Mawson was determined to have Macquarie Island proclaimed a sanctuary, and this was achieved in 1916. \nHonours.\nIn 1914, Mawson was knighted.\nHe was made a fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1923, and was a foundation Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science. He was made a life fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1913.\nOther recognition and awards included:\nPersonal life.\nMawson married Francisca Adriana (Paquita) Delprat (1891\u20131974) on 31 March 1914 at Holy Trinity Church of England, Balaclava, Melbourne, in an elaborate wedding. Captain John King Davis, who had captained \"Aurora\" and served as second-in-charge of the AAE, served as best man. She was the daughter of the Dutch-born metallurgist and general manager of BHP, G. D. Delprat, whom Mawson had met during his time in Broken Hill. They had met when she was 17, not long after Mawson's return from the \"Nimrod\" Expedition in 1909. They got engaged before Mawson left for the Australasian Antarctic Expedition in 1911. A series of letters written by both of them between 1911 and 1914 was published in 2005 as \"This Everlasting Silence: The Love Letters of Paquita Delprat and Sir Douglas Mawson, 1911-1914\", introduced and annotated by Nancy Robinson Flannery. \nTheir first daughter, Patricia Marietje Thomas, later a notable parasitologist, was born in 1915. The family moved into an apartment in the recently-completed Ruthven Mansions in Pulteney Street, Adelaide, which was their first home together. However, Douglas was called to do war service in England, so they were only there for around a year. Paquita and Patricia went to stay with Mrs Delprat in Melbourne for some time, before Paquita, too, went to assist Mawson in his wartime role at the Ministry of Munitions in England, leaving Pat with her mother. Their second child, Jessica Paquita \"Quita\" Mawson (1917\u20132004; married name McEwin), who became a bacteriologist, was born in London.\nIn 1920 the Mawsons moved into their new home, \"Jerbii\" at 44 King Street, Brighton, built on land owned by Paquita's parents and given to Douglas and Paquita as a wedding present. They had previously rented a home on the South Esplanade while it was being built, after returning from England after World War I. They lived in Brighton until at least 1958, when Douglas died.\nPaquita worked for the Mothers' and Babies' Health Association, for which she was president for nine years, and the Australian Red Cross Society. Like her husband, she was prominent in Adelaide's social and cultural life, and wrote two books: \"A Vision of Steel\", a biography of her father G. D. Delprat published in 1958, and \"Mawson of the Antarctic\", about her husband, published in 1964. She too was awarded an OBE, and after Mawson's knighthood, became Lady Francisca Adriana Mawson.\nDuring his time based in England in 1916 when working for the War Office, Mawson established a close personal relationship with Kathleen Scott, the widow of polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott. Historian David Day, in his 2013 work \"Flaws in the Ice: In Search of Douglas Mawson\", suggested that the pair had conducted an affair in 1916 in Sandwich, Kent. However, this is refuted by historian Tom Griffiths, who says that they were united in grief at the time, and found solace in each other, perhaps an emotional and spiritual connection. The claim is also rejected by Mawson's great-granddaughter Emma McEwin, who has read Kathleen Scott's diaries and written a book about her great-grandparents' marriage, and adventurer Tim Jarvis.\nMawson's elder brother William studied medicine at Sydney university and became a GP in Campbelltown. He cared for their parents in their later years, with their father Robert dying in 1912 aged 58 and their mother Margaret at the same age in 1917. Mawson Park in Campbelltown was named after William in 1938. William died in 1939.\nLater life and death.\nUpon his retirement from teaching in 1952 he was made an emeritus professor of the University of Adelaide. The university published \"Sir Douglas Mawson Anniversary Volume: Contributions to geology in honour of Sir Douglas Mawson's 70th birthday anniversary\".\nOn 12 March 1958, Mawson paid a visit to the Soviet Antarctic ship \"Cooperatzia\" (aka \"Cooperatsiya\" and \"Kooperatsiya\"), and spent several hours talking to Soviet scientific leader Alexey Tryoshnikov. The ship's visit was an occasion for helping to develop further friendly relations between Australian and Soviet scientists, and the American scientist G. D. Cartwright was also on board. \nHe died at his Brighton home in South Australia on 14 October 1958 from a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 76. Prime Minister Robert Menzies said of him upon hearing of his death: Sir Douglas Mawson was one of the very great men of my lifetime. He had courage, remarkable ability, great vision and great tenacity. Future generations of Australians will look back on his life as a source of inspiration\".\nHe was honoured with a Commonwealth state funeral on 17 October at St Jude's Church in Brighton, South Australia, where he was also interred. The Governor-General Sir William Slim, was not able to attend, but was represented at the funeral by Brigadier G. E. H. Bleby. \nA memorial service was also held at St Peter's Cathedral in Adelaide, arranged by the University of Adelaide.\nOn 31 October 1958, a tribute to his memory was paid by members of the Soviet Geographical Society at a special meeting. Evgeny Suzyumov, a member of the First Russian Antarctic Expedition, said that Mawson had developed friendships with Soviet Antarctic explorers in his later years.\nIn 2008, the Brighton Historical Society with support from the Mawson and Sprigg families, endorsed by the Holdfast Bay Council, installed an official monument at the gravesite of both Paquita and Douglas Mawson. The monument consists of a granite boulder from Arkaroola, gifted by the Sprigg family with the approval of the Adnyamathanha people. A small plaque acknowledges the gift, while the main plaque highlights some of Mawson's achievements.\nOngoing work on BANZARE papers.\nAt the time of his death he had still not completed editorial work on all the papers resulting from the BANZARE. He had been assisted in this work by his eldest daughter, Patricia Thomas, and upon his death, the Science and Industry Endowment Fund provided a \u00a3300 grant to assist in completing the work. Thomas completed the work in 1975.\nLegacy.\nGeneral.\nMawson's early geological studies were highly regarded. Frederick Chapman, then palaeontologist at the National Museum of Victoria and later the Commonwealth government official palaeontologist, based two of his own studies on Mawson's New Hebridean study (1905 &amp; 1907). A paper co-authored by Chapman and Mawson was published in the \"Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London\" in 1906 \u2013 significant recognition for one so early in his career. Two of his studies (both 1949), along with a 1947 study by Reg Sprigg as well as more recent studies, are cited in support of the application to make seven geographically separate areas in the Flinders Ranges a World Heritage Site. The application was submitted to the UNESCO World Heritage Centre for consideration in 2021, and as of August 2025[ [update]] remain on the \"tentative\" list. Alderman and Tilley (1960) considered that Mawson could be regarded as one of the founders of geochemistry in Australia, based on his early work on the chemical aspects of geology.\nAs leader of the BANZARE expeditions, Mawson was instrumental in establishing the territorial claim to 42% of the Antarctic during 1929\u20131930 and 1930\u20131931, which was established under legislation passed in 1933.\nAccording to ADB biographer F. J. Jacka: \"He did not propound new, fundamental theories but he extended and developed geological thinking and knowledge over a wide range of topics and locations, and through his leadership created opportunities for the realization of major developments in many disciplines. His lectures about Antarctica were widely acclaimed around the world\". His former mentor Edgeworth David said of Mawson in a public tribute: \"Mawson was the real leader who was the soul of our expedition to the Magnetic Pole. We really have in him an Australian Nansen, of infinite resource, splendid physique, astonishing indifference to frost\". \nJ. Gordon Hayes wrote in his book \"The conquest of the south pole; Antarctic exploration, 1906\u20131931\" (1928): \"Sir Douglas Mawson's Expedition, judged by the magnitude both of its scale and of its achievements, was the greatest and most consummate expedition that ever sailed for Antarctica\". \nSoon after news of the disastrous Far Eastern expedition broke, Mawson's decision to put such a large amount of their essential provisions on one sledge was criticised. Mark Pharoah, researcher and curator of the Mawson Collection at the South Australian Museum, said that since the release of his journals and other expedition records, historians have questioned his navigational and leadership abilities, and criticised his risk-taking. J. Gordon Hayes was critical of the three men not using skis.\nHis image appeared on several postage stamps of the Australian Antarctic Territory: 5 pence (1961), 5 pence (1961), 27 cents and 75 cents (1982), 10 cents (2011), 45 cents (1999).\nIn 1979 the Australian Academy of Science established the Mawson Lecture.\nThe centenary of Mawson's birth was celebrated in 1982, which included the Fourth International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences being held at the University of Adelaide, with the proceedings dedicated to him, held in August. The symposium was brought forward two years and held in Adelaide to mark the occasion.\nIn 1983 the Douglas Mawson chair of geology was established at the University of Adelaide. As of 2024, Professor Alan Collins held the post.\nHis image appeared from 1984 to 1996 on the first Australian one hundred-dollar note, and in 2012 on a $1 coin issued within the \"Inspirational Australians\" series.\nOne of Mawson's students at the University of Adelaide was Reg Sprigg, who discovered Precambrian fossils when assessing an old mine site in the Ediacara Hills in 1946. His discovery led to other geologists defining a new geological period, the Ediacaran, for the first time in over 100 years, which was officially ratified by the IUGS in 2004. Sprigg co-founded, with his wife Griselda, the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, and named his son Douglas after his former mentor. Doug Sprigg continues to run the sanctuary as of 2024[ [update]].\nIn 2007, adventurer Tim Jarvis re-enacted Mawson's expedition to Antarctica, simulating the conditions in the 1912 trek. They followed the same route and tried to do everything done by Mawson's expedition, although did not eat any dogs. Jarvis said afterwards that it gave him a new-found respect for Mawson.\nIn 2011, Ranulph Fiennes included Mawson in his book \"My Heroes: Extraordinary Courage, Exceptional People\".\nIn May 2012, the \"Australian Antarctic Magazine\" published a \"Mawson Centenary Special\" issue to commemorate 100 years since the Australasian Antarctic Expedition.\nIn 2013, the \"Australian Mawson Centenary Expedition\", led by Chris Turney and Chris Fogwill, scientists from the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, led a privately-funded expedition of 48 people including scientists and members of the public, to investigate Antarctic and subantarctic oceanography, climate, and biology. The expedition visited Mawson's huts at Cape Denison, using motorised vehicles with tracks to traverse the of ice from the shore. On the return journey, their ship, the MV \"Akademik Shokalskiy\", became trapped in ice. After two other vessels were unable to reach the stricken ship, the expedition members were eventually being airlifted by helicopter to the Chinese polar research vessel \"Xue Long\", while the Russian crew members had to stay on board the ship. Turney presented the results of their findings at an event at the Royal Institution in London in July 2014.\nReviewing David Roberts' 2013 book \"Alone on the Ice\" in \"The Observer\", Paul Harris called Mawson \"the unsung hero of Antarctica\". In the book, Roberts suggests that Mawson was little known for two reasons: firstly that the British press of the time focused on British \"imperial heroes\" such as Scott; and secondly that Mawson had opted for carrying out scientific expeditions rather than the \"exciting race to the south pole that had captured the public imagination\".\nIn 2015, the Australian Museum in Sydney developed an exhibition called \"Trailblazers: Australia's 50 Greatest Explorers\", which included Mawson.\nMawson Analytical Spectrometry Services (MASS) are facilities offered by the Faculty of Sciences, Engineering and Technology at the University of Adelaide to researchers and commercial partners. The service provides thermal ionisation mass spectrometry, Stable Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry, and Organic Molecular Analysis and Characterisation.\nAt Oxley College (founded in 1982) in Burradoo, New South Wales, one of the six houses is called Mawson, as is at Clarence High School in Hobart, Tasmania, Forest Lodge Public School, and Fort Street High School, both in Sydney, where he was educated.\nIn April 2023, Emma McEwin, a great-granddaughter of Mawson, presented the Sir Hubert Wilkins Oration for the History Trust of South Australia, \"explor[ing] the personalities and backgrounds of both Hubert Wilkins and Douglas Mawson\".\nGenera and species.\nIn 1937 the fish species \"Dissostichus mawsoni\" (Antarctic toothfish) was named by English ichthyologist John Roxborough Norman in honour of Mawson, as the 1911-1913 Australasian Antarctic Expedition obtained the species' type specimen.\nIn 1948, Carroll William Dodge published a genus of fungi within the family Lichinaceae, named \"Mawsonia\" in his honour.\nIn 1966, the fossil genus \"Mawsonites\", dated to the Ediacaran, was named after Mawson, and its type species, \"Mawsonites spriggi\", after his student Reg Sprigg, by Martin Glaessner and Mary Wade.\nCollections.\nThe Australian Polar Collection of Antarctic exploration artefacts is on permanent display at the South Australian Museum. Previously known as the Mawson Gallery, in 2018 the gallery underwent development to expand the displays of two other South Australian explorers, John Riddoch Rymill and George Hubert Wilkins. The Mawson collection is the largest of the three collections, containing over 100,000 items. These were acquired in two lots: one came from the Australian Museum in Sydney, while a larger collection of items was donated by the Mawson family via the University of Adelaide in 2000. The collection includes Mawson's balaclava, as illustrated on the hundred-dollar note, as well as his earliest surviving field notebook after arriving in Adelaide, which include notes on Mount Lofty, Kangaroo Island, Broken Hill, and Olary. The Mawson Collection Trust, made up of descendants of Douglas and Paquita Mawson, provided significant funding towards renewing the gallery in 2017.\nThe Douglas Mawson Antarctic Collection is held in the Tate Museum in the Mawson Building at the University of Adelaide, along with many minerals, rocks, fossils, and other specimens related to geological phenomena. The museum, named after Ralph Tate, foundation Elder Professor of Natural Sciences at the university of from 1875 until 1901, opened in 1902, and moved into Mawson Laboratories (Building) when it opened in 1952.\nThe Australian Museum has a collection of 2000 Antarctic rock and mineral specimens collected on the Australasian Antarctic Expedition, named the Sir Douglas Mawson Collection.\nThe National Library of Australia in Canberra holds a collection of papers relating to the Mawson family, collected by Gareth Thomas and presented to the library in 2010. Most of the papers consist of personal correspondence of Paquita Mawson principally with her daughter Patricia, but also includes letters to her daughter Jessica and other members of her extended family, some written from the Netherlands in Dutch. There are a few letters written by Douglas Mawson to Patricia between 1925 and 1931.\nThe Sir Douglas Mawson Collection at the National Museum of Australia contains four items relating to BANZARE in 1931, including three proclamations relating to claiming land in Antarctica, and a food canister.\nIn his role as honorary curator of the South Australian Museum from 1906 to 1958, Mawson was instrumental in helping to establish the minerals collection there. In 1906, he arranged the purchase of part of the John Henry Dunstan Collection, which contained significant specimens from the copper mines at Burra, Moonta and Wallaroo Mines. This formed the core of the museum's now extensive minerals collection, and was at the time the largest private mineral collection in country. Mawson also assisted in the purchase of the Hall and Watkin Brown Collections, which included many specimens from Broken Hill and other important places in New South Wales.\nTranscription of early diaries.\nMawson's Antarctic and field diaries are kept in the South Australian Museum. Those pertaining to his extensive Australian geological field work have been transcribed fairly recently at the museum. The transcription work, undertaken by volunteers including Mawson's grandson Alun Thomas, was undertaken from around 2005 to 2025. \nBetewen 1905 and 1953 Mawson carried out many field trips, mostly in northeastern South Australia, and he kept diaries of every one of his roughly 70 trips. Over 30 field note books, each recording one of more trips, are held in the Polar Collection at the South Australian Museum, along with more than 2000 photographs, mostly taken on his field trips. Many of the diaries are illustrated by hand-drawn sketches and geological sections, and scans of these sketches as well as the photographs have been inserted into the transcribed diaries. The diaries also include accounts of the annual excursions with third-year geology students, who only numbered a few in the early trips but by 1948 there were 17 students and staff. If a female student was included, a female chaperone would be included, and in 1937 Mawson's daughters Patricia and Jessica joined a student excursion.\nMawson recorded significant geological observations in these diaries, mostly for his own research and preparation of scientific papers, so used many abbreviations indecipherable to the lay reader. These have been deciphered and included in the transcriptions with the help of geologist Jim Jago. The diaries also provide an interesting historical record of the times. The work continues, and it is hoped to make the content of the transcribe diaries, along with drawings and photographs, more widely available.\nPlaces and landmarks.\nThe geology building on the main University of Adelaide campus was named Mawson Laboratories on the occasion of his retirement in 1952. The building is now known as the Mawson Building. In November 1959, the Mawson Institute for Antarctic Research was established within the Department of Geology, in what is as of 2025[ [update]] known as the Mawson Geo Centre. The aim of the institute was to foster Antarctic study and research, by the maintenance of a library and collection, and by the delivery of occasional public lectures. The Mawson Institute was officially opened on 15 April 1961 by the prime minister, Robert Menzies, and included the collection of Mawson's geological and historical artefacts bequeathed by Paquita Mawson after Mawson's death. A recording of his speech is available online via the National Library of Australia website.\nOn 21 October 1952, Mawson Peak, an active volcanic summit on Heard Island, Antarctica, was officially named in honour of Mawson.\nMawson Station in Antarctica was officially named after Mawson on 13 February 1954. Phillip Law, inaugural director of the Australian Antarctic Division, selected the location near Horseshoe Harbour as Australia's first overwintering station on the Antarctic continent, and conducting a flag-raising and official naming ceremony on that date. Mawson is the oldest station established south of the Antarctic Circle. The Mawson Coast was also named after him.\nIn 1959, a mountain peak in Tasmania was gazetted as Mount Mawson, named after Mawson. It lies within the Mount Field National Park.\nMawson is a suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. The suburb was gazetted in 1966 and is named after him. The theme for street names in this area is Antarctic exploration.\nIn 1969 the District of Mawson, an electoral district of South Australia, was created and named in honour of Mawson.\nMawson Plateau, situated in what is now the Arkaroola Protection Area in the Northern Flinders Ranges, was originally known as the Freeling Heights lower granite plateau. It was named after Mawson some time before 1984. Mawson Valley is also in Arkaroola, and Mawson was responsible for naming a rocky granite outcrop in the valley \"Sitting Bull\" in 1945.\nMinor planet 4456 Mawson was named in his honour after its discovery on 27 July 1989 by R. H. McNaught at Siding Spring Observatory in New South Wales. as is Dorsa Mawson, a wrinkle ridge on the Moon.\nThe Mawson Trail, a cycling and walking trail created in the 1990s, stretching from the Adelaide Hills to the Flinders Ranges, was named after Mawson.\nThe Mawson's Huts Foundation, based in Sydney, was established in 1996 as a charity. It works on conserving Mawson's Huts at Cape Denison, has funded and organised 14 major expeditions there, and in 2013, it opened the Mawson's Huts Replica Museum in Hobart. The museum is located on the waterfront, near the wharf used by \"SY Aurora\".\nThe suburb Mawson Lakes, a northern suburb of Adelaide, was founded in the late 1990s and named in his honour, and one of the two man-made lakes in the suburb is called the Sir Douglas Mawson Lake. A campus of the University of South Australia in the suburb is known as the Mawson Lakes campus.\nThe high street in Meadows, South Australia, the town near his farm, Harewood, is named after him.\nIn the arts and popular culture.\nAfter official photographer Frank Hurley's return from AAE in early 1913, documentary footage attributed to him was released in cinemas. Now often referred to as \"Home of the Blizzard\" in Australia, this silent film has a complicated provenance, and it is no longer known which reels (now restored and held by the NFSA) were shown in the 1913 cinema showing. This version of the film was released in the UK as \"Life in the Antarctic\". \nTwo films about BANZARE, the silent film \"Southward Ho with Mawson\" (1930) and the talkie \"Siege of the South\" (1931), both made by Frank Hurley using footage filmed by him on the expeditions, were released in cinemas as official recordings of the voyages. Takings from the film contributed to defray the costs of the expedition, and schoolchildren's attendance contributed significantly to the takings. \nA portrait of Mawson painted by in 1933 by Henry James Haley was gifted to the National Portrait Gallery in Canberra by the Mawson family in 2010. Other portraits of him were painted by W. Seppelt (1922); Jack Carington Smith (1955); and Ivor Hele (1956), which are (or were) held in the University of Adelaide. Another by Hele, created in 1959, is held by the Royal Geographical Society in London. \nAdelaide sculptor John Dowie created two bronze busts of Mawson in 1982, one of which is on North Terrace, Adelaide, and another at Mawson Station in Antarctica. The bust on North Terrace, which had been suggested by Fred Jacka of the Mawson Institute, was endorsed by Adelaide city council, and partly funded by a public fund-raising effort. Lord Mayor of Adelaide Arthur John Watson made the presentation, and Sir Mark Oliphant unveiled the bust, which coincided with the Fourth International Symposium on Antarctic Earth Sciences, brought forward two years to celebrate the centenary of Mawson's birth. The bust is mounted on a marble base, and has a boulder of igneous rock situated on either side. The eastern boulder is of pegmatite from Mawson Valley in Arkaroola, while the western boulder is of charnockite, from Mawson, Antarctica. Another bronze bust, created by Jean Perrier in 1980, is held in Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 2023 the City of Holdfast Bay resolved to commission of a memorial bronze bust of Mawson for placement somewhere in Brighton, where the Mawson family lived.\nIn 1991, Irish folk musician Andy Irvine recorded the song \"Douglas Mawson\" for his album \"Rude Awakening\". The song recounts the events of the Far Eastern Party of the Antarctic expedition.\nIn 2008, ABC Television screened a feature-length documentary film, titled \"Mawson: Life and Death in Antarctica\", about Tim Jarvis's recreation of Mawson's journey. Jarvis also released a book of the same name that year. The film is available via the National Film and Sound Archive website and the library streaming service Kanopy.\nDavid Roberts' 2013 account of Mawson's AAE expedition, \"Alone on the Ice\", and the deadly effect of dog liver, are referenced in the plot of S3 E3 of British television series \"New Tricks\" in 2014, where it is used to commit the almost-perfect murder.\nIn December 2013, the first opera to be based on Mawson's 1911\u20131914 expedition to Antarctica, \"The Call of Aurora\" (by Tasmanian composer Joe Bugden) was performed at the Peacock Theatre in the Salamanca Arts Centre in Hobart. The opera was again performed at the Peacock in August 2022.\nIn 2019, Australian Dance Theatre presented the premiere of \"South\" by artistic director Garry Stewart in Adelaide. The dance work reflected upon the treacherous journey undertaken by Mawson and his team in the summer of 1912\u20131913. The work, which toured regional South Australia, was intended to convey a message about the climate change crisis. Stewart won Outstanding Achievement in Choreography for \"South\" in 2019 at the Australian Dance Awards.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is typically used in a criminal trial to \"make the case\" against defendants believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspects' arrest or search threaten to result in their acquittal. It also can be extended to encompass substantive misstatements of fact to convict those whom the police believe to be guilty, procedural misstatements to \"justify\" a search and seizure, or even the inclusion of statements to frame an innocent citizen. More generically, it has been said to be \"[l]ying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction.\"\nUnited States.\nWhen police lie under oath, innocent people can be convicted and jailed; hundreds of convictions have been set aside as a result of such police misconduct. Some sources say that it is both a police and a prosecutorial problem and that it is a systemic response to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, which was recognized in the US Supreme Court decision \"Mapp v. Ohio\". Other authors have drawn a connection between perjury and an increased emphasis on the number of arrests and convictions made. \nThe extent of the practice is debated; journalists, activists, and defense attorneys have exposed numerous instances of false testimony, but police officers and police unions, while acknowledging its occurrence, deny that it is widespread or systemic. The defense attorney Alan Dershowitz argued, in the New York Times and before a congressional hearing, that police perjury is commonplace: \nAs I read about the disbelief expressed by some prosecutors... I thought of Claude Rains's classic response, in \"Casablanca\" on being told there was gambling in Rick's place: \"I'm shocked\u2014shocked.\" For anyone who has practiced criminal law in the state or Federal courts, the disclosures about rampant police perjury cannot possibly come as a surprise. \"Testilying\"\u2014as the police call it\u2014has long been an open secret among prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges.\nIn 1995, the \"Boston Globe\" reported that New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton had created a furor by saying that he agreed with most of Dershowitz's statement. The \"Globe\" quoted Richard Bradley, then-president of the Boston Police Patrolmen's Association: \"I find it incredible that he would say that. Every day all over the country, police officers are testifying. Everyone realizes they are testifying under oath. If this was this much a problem, it would have come to light over the years.\" Bradley said that in 27 years on the Boston force he had never encountered the practice.\nIn a 1996 article in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars' Club?\", Joseph D. McNamara, the chief of police of San Jose, said, \"Not many people took defense attorney Alan M. Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops are taught to lie at the birth of their careers at the Police Academy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a police uniform, I've come to believe that hundreds of thousands of law-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every year testifying about drug arrests.\" He also noted, \"Within the last few years, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities have suffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oath about drug evidence.\"\nIn 2011, after finding a former police detective, Jason Arbeeny, guilty of official misconduct for planting drugs on a suspect, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of the New York Supreme Court wrote that he \"thought [he] was not na\u00efve, but even this court was shocked, not only by the seeming pervasive scope of misconduct but even more distressingly by the seeming casualness by which such conduct is employed.\" Arbeeny was then sentenced to five years of probation and 300 hours of community service. Also in 2011, a former San Francisco Police Commissioner, Peter Keane, wrote that lying under oath was a \"routine practice\" for narcotics officers.\nIn 2019, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court called out the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the National Security Division of the US Department of Justice for dishonesty in applications for continuance of a wiretap of Carter Page, saying that it called into question the reliability of other evidence submitted by the FBI. The practice was documented in a previous report released by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, Michael Horowitz, and was cited by the court.\nPolice officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as \"Brady cops.\" In \"Brady v. Maryland\", the US Supreme Court held that prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys of any favorable evidence, such as if a law enforcement official involved in a case has a sustained record of knowingly lying in an official capacity.\nRemedies.\nA police officer's reputation for trustworthiness is an important asset to their effectiveness; police who have been caught lying to the court make poor witnesses, and previous convictions relying on their testimony can be vacated if their misconduct is pervasive. This can result in termination, and such terminations have been judicially enforced. About a perjured affidavit supporting a raid that killed two, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said \"that's totally unacceptable. I've told my police department that if you lie, you die. When you lie on an affidavit, that's not sloppy police work, that's a crime.\"\nSome suggest that narrowing or blunting the exclusionary rule may get rid of the incentive for police to lie to the court. That has happened to the extent that the US Supreme Court has recognized exceptions like the \"good faith exception.\" Some argue that civil liability could have a prophylactic effect on police misconduct. Others suggest that the ubiquity of video recordings, both by the police and by civilians, will operate to slow down the misconduct and to reverse the trend.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Under the terms of Article III.2 International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards must be applied to nuclear exports.\nEach State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to provide: (a) source or special fissionable material, or (b) equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material, to any non-nuclear-weapon State for peaceful purposes, unless the source or special fissionable material shall be subject to the safeguards required by this Article.\nHistory.\nBetween 1971 and 1974, a group of 15 nuclear supplier states held a series of informal meetings in Vienna chaired by Professor Claude Zangger of Switzerland. The group's objective was to reach a common understanding on: (a) the definition of \"equipment or material especially designed or prepared for the processing, use or production of special fissionable material;\" and (b) the conditions and procedures that would govern exports of such equipment or material in order to meet the obligations of Article III.2 on the basis of fair commercial competition. The group, which became known as the Zangger Committee, decided that it would be informal and that its decisions would not be legally binding upon its members.\nThe committee (a) maintains and updates a list of equipment that may only be exported if safeguards are applied to the recipient facility (called the \"Trigger List\" because such exports trigger the requirement for safeguards); and (b) allows members to coordinate on nuclear export issues. The relative informality of the Zangger Committee has enabled it to take the lead on certain nonproliferation issues that would be more difficult to resolve in the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Moreover, the People's Republic of China is a member of the Zangger Committee.\nAt the October 2000 meeting, the committee discussed the results of the 2000 NPT Review Conference (REVCON). The committee agreed to form two informal \"Friends of the Chair\" groups to: 1) consider preparations for the 2005 NPT REVCON; and 2) continue consideration of possible future adoption of a policy of requiring full-scope safeguards as a condition of supply to non-nuclear weapon states. The U.S. reported on the status of consideration of possible additional controls on americium and neptunium. Members agreed that these materials fell outside the scope of NPT Article III.2 for inclusion on the Trigger List. Sweden, chair of a working group to consider addition of plutonium enrichment equipment to the Trigger List, reported no agreement as yet. The chairman reported on an initial informal meeting with IAEA staff to discuss procedures for keeping the agency informed on Trigger List changes and the rationale for such changes, since the agency uses the Zangger Trigger List as a reference document.\nChairs.\nThe following have served as chairs of the Zangger Committee:\nThe United Kingdom Mission to the United Nations Office at Vienna acts as the committee's secretariat.\nMembers.\nThere are 39 Members States in the Zangger Committee:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe European Commission is a permanent observer.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A \"thaler\" size silver coin has a diameter of about and a weight of about 25 to 30 grams (roughly 1 ounce). The word is shortened from , the original \"thaler\" coin minted in Joachimsthal, Bohemia, from 1520.\nWhile the first standard coin of the Holy Roman Empire was the of 1524, its longest-lived coin was the , which contained &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20449 Cologne Mark of fine silver (or 25.984\u00a0g), and which was issued in various versions from 1566 to 1875. From the 17th century a lesser-valued \"North German thaler\" currency unit emerged, which by the 19th century became par with the .\nThe \"thaler\" silver coin type continued to be minted until the 20th century in the form of the Mexican peso until 1914, the five Swiss franc coin until 1928, the US silver dollar until 1935, and the Austrian Maria Theresa thaler. These days thaler-sized silver coins are not in active circulation anymore, but are minted by various government mints as bullion or numismatic items for collectors. The current derivative of the name, \"dollar\" (first Spanish and now mostly English), also survives as the name of several modern currencies.\nEtymology.\nGerman \"taler\" is recorded from the 1530s, as an abbreviation of \"Joachimstaler\". The silver mines at Joachimstal had opened in 1516, and the first such coins were minted there in 1518.\nThe original spelling was \"taler\" (so Alberus 1540).\nGerman \"-taler\" means \"of the valley\" (cf. \"Neanderthaler\") -- cognate with English \"dale\", which also means \"valley\".\nBy the late 16th century, the word was variously spelled as German \"taler\", \"toler\", \"thaler\", \"thaller\"; Low German \"daler\", \"dahler\".\nIn 18th to 19th-century German orthography, \"Thaler\" became standard, changed to \"Taler\" in the 1902 spelling reform.\nThe name \"taler\", \"thaler\" was soon used in compounds denoting various types of silver coins of thaler size, thus \"Reichstaler\" (1566), \"Silbertaler\", \"Albertustaler\" (1612), \"Laubthaler\" (1726), \"Kronenthaler\" (1755), \"Ortsthaler\", \"Sch\u00fctzentaler\", \"Bankthaler\", \"Speciethaler\", etc.\nUnits used in the Netherlands include the , the \"rijksdaalder\" and the . From 1754, many German states used the \"Conventionsthaler\" as well as a lower-valued \"North German thaler\" or \"Reichsthaler\" worth &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 the Conventionsthaler. From 1840 the various North German thalers converged to the value of the Prussian thaler and afterwards the \"Vereinsthaler\".\nThe corresponding English silver coin of the period was the \"crown\". The Low German word was adopted in English as \"daler\" by 1550, modified to \"dollar\" by about 1600.\nEnglish \"thaler\" was introduced in the first half of the 19th century to refer to the coins of the German states, as the word \"dollar\" was increasingly understood to refer to the United States dollar.\nPredecessors.\nThe development of large silver coins is an innovation of the beginning Early Modern period.\nThe largest medieval silver coins were known as groat (German \"Groschen\"), from \"denarius grossus\" or \"thick penny\". These rarely exceeded a weight of 6 grams.\nEven these coins were increasingly debased due to the Great Bullion Famine of the 15th century which occurred for several reasons including continued warfare and the centuries-long loss of silver and gold in indirect one-sided trades importing spices, porcelain, silk and other fine cloths and exotic goods from India, Indonesia and the Far East. This continual debasement had reached a point that silver content in \"Groschen\"-type coins had dropped, in some cases, to less than five percent, making the coins of much less individual value than they had in the beginning.\nThis trend was inverted with the discovery of new and substantial silver deposits in Europe beginning in about the 1470s. Italy began the first tentative steps toward a large silver coinage with the introduction in 1472 of the Venetian lira tron in excess of 6 grams, a substantial increase over the 4-gram gros tournois of France. However, it was only in 1484 that Archduke Sigismund of Tirol issued the first truly revolutionary silver coin, the \"half Guldengroschen\" of roughly 15 g. This was a very rare coin, almost a trial piece, but it did circulate so successfully that demand could not be met.\nFinally, with the silver deposits\u2014being mined at Schwaz\u2014to work with and his mint at Hall, Sigismund issued, in 1486, large numbers of the first true thaler-sized coin, the \"Guldengroschen\" (\"gold-groat\", being of silver but equal in value to a Goldgulden). It was an instant and unqualified success. Soon it was being copied widely by many states who had the necessary silver. The engravers, no less affected by the Renaissance than were other artists, began creating intricate and elaborate designs featuring the heraldic arms and standards of the minting state as well as brutally realistic, sometimes unflattering, depictions of the ruler (monarch).\nJoachimsthaler.\nBy 1518, \"guldiners\" of similar weight to \"guldengroschen\" were popping up everywhere in central Europe. In the Kingdom of Bohemia, then ruled together with Hungary by Louis II of the Jagiellonian dynasty, a guldiner was minted\u2014 of similar physical size but slightly less fineness\u2014that was named in German the \"Joachimsthaler\", from the silver mined by the Counts of Schlick at a rich source near Joachimsthal (today J\u00e1chymov in the Czech Republic) where \"Thal\" (Tal) means \"valley\" in German. Saint Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary, was portrayed on the coin along with the Bohemian lion.\nSimilar coins began to be minted in neighbouring valleys rich in silver deposits, each named after the particular 'thal' or valley from which the silver was extracted. There were soon so many of them that these silver coins began to be known more widely as 'thaler' in German and 'tolar' in Czech.\nIn the 17th century, some Joachimsthalers were in circulation in the Tsardom of Russia, where they were called \"yefimok\" () \u2013 a distortion of the name Joachim.\nHoly Roman Empire.\nThe new large silver coins that became ubiquitous as the 16th century went on were named \"Thaler\" in German, while in England and France, they were named \"crown\" and \"\u00e9cu\", respectively, both names taken from what had originally been gold coins. The thaler size silver coins minted in Habsburg Spain was the eight real coin, later also known as peso and in English as the \"Spanish dollar\".\nThe first large silver coin standardized by the Holy Roman Empire was the \"Guldengroschen\" in 1524. Under the new Imperial Minting Standard (\"Reichsm\u00fcnzfu\u00df\") it weighed &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20448th a Cologne Mark of silver or 29.232 g, and had a fineness 0.9375. However, its longest-lasting standard coin was the \"Reichsthaler\" (\"imperial thaler\") defined in 1566 as containing &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20449th a Cologne \"Mark\" of fine silver, or 25.984 g. It was widely adopted and produced for the next 300 years at rates varying from 9 to 9&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 \"Reichsthalers\" to the \"Mark\".\nSee the \"chronology of thaler development\" for the development of the Reichsthaler and related currency units from 1566 to 1875. Confusingly, there also was defined a North German \"thaler\" currency (also called \"Reichsthalers\") of less value to the standard \"Reichsthaler\" specie coin; this thaler was worth 12 to a \"Mark\" after 1690, 13&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 to a \"Mark\" after 1754, and 14 to a \"Mark\" (the Prussian thaler) by the 1840s. Furthermore, in 1754 a \"Conventionsthaler\" was developed by the Austrian Empire minted at 10 to a \"Mark\" of fine silver. While it was adopted by most German states, Scandinavia and a few North German states retained the original \"Reichsthaler\" specie of 9&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444 to a \"Mark\" as their standard coin until 1875.\nCity view thalers and l\u00f6sers.\nThe \"city view\" thalers of the 17th and 18th century have predecessors in stylised representations of cities (as three towers, or a city gate) on the obverse of thaler coins in the late 16th century, such as the L\u00fcneburg thaler of Rudolf II made in 1584. More elaborate city views become current in the first half of the 17th century (e.g. Augsburg 1627, Nuremberg 1631).\nThe type continues to be popular throughout the 18th century, culminating in detailed city panoramas rendered in one-point perspective.\nIn the late 16th and 17th centuries, there was a fashion of oversized thaler coins, the so-called \"multiple thalers\", often called \"\" in Germany. The first were minted in the Duchy of Brunswick-Luneburg, and indeed the majority were struck there. Some of these coins reached colossal size, as much as sixteen normal thalers, exceeding a full pound (over 450\u00a0g) of silver and being over in diameter. The name \"L\u00f6ser\" most likely was derived from a large gold coin minted in Hamburg called the \"portugal\u00f6ser\", worth 10 ducats, which were based on Portuguese 10-ducat coins. Eventually the term was applied to numerous similar coins worth more than a single thaler. These coins are very rare and highly sought after by collectors. As few of them were circulated in any real sense, they are often well-preserved.\nDutch Republic.\nThe Spanish Netherlands and the independent Dutch Republic has had a history of minting large silver coins separately from the rest of the Holy Roman Empire. It issued the \"kruisdaalder\" (depicting the Cross of Burgundy) in 1567, and then the \"leeuwendaalder\" (the \"lion thaler\", depicting the Belgic Lion) in 1575, the latter of weight 27.68 g (427.2 grains) and 0.743 fineness. With the growing popularity of the German reichsthaler, however, the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands had to follow up with their own Dutch rijksdaalder in 1583, of weight 29.03 g (448 grains) and 0.885 fineness, and featuring an armored half bust of William the Silent. Friesland, Gelderland, Holland, Kampen, Overijssel, Utrecht, West Friesland, Zeeland, and Zwolle minted armored half bust rijksdaalders until the end of the 17th century.\nThe pace of depreciation of the small-denomination \"stuiver\" quickened from the 1570s, with the leeuwendaalder rising from 32 to 40 stuivers by 1619, and the rijksdaalder from 42 to 50 stuivers. The \"Amsterdam Wisselbank\" was then founded in 1608 to establish a stable bank currency with the rijksdaalder of 29.03 g, 0.875 fine (or 25.4 g fine silver) fixed at 50 stuivers or 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 gulden.\nThe bank's success helped the Dutch Republic become Europe's financial center in the 17th century and maintain the reichsthaler as its banking currency unit despite Germany's descent into the chaos of the Thirty Years' War. As a bullion entrep\u00f4t of the period, the Netherlands produced reichsthalers for Germany and Scandinavia, and exported leeuwendaalders to the Levant and the Ottoman Empire. The latter survives to this day in the form of the Bulgarian lev, Romanian leu, and Moldovan leu.\nLion Daalders were used a lot in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and in what's now known as the USA. The city of New Amsterdam, currently New York, was founded by the Dutch in the early 17th century. \"The Lion Daalder holds an important place in American history as America\u2019s first dollar and the root of the word from where the current currency, the US Dollar, found its name.\"https://\nBy the 18th century the Spanish-controlled Dutch territories eventually became the Austrian Netherlands. In 1754 it issued the Kronenthaler of weight 29.45 g and 0.873 fineness, or 25.71 g fine silver. This coin was adopted by many South German states by the early 19th century.\nThe term \"daalder\" continued to refer to 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 \"gulden\" in currency even after the discontinuation of the 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442 gulden or 30 \" stuiver\" piece in the 19th century.\nThe \"rijksdaalder\" was also known as the silver ducat, which is still minted for collectors in the Netherlands today.\nSpain and France.\nThe discovery of massive silver supplies in Spanish America in the 1530s enabled the massive minting of Spain's eight-real coin well into the 20th century, weighing 27.47 g, 0.9306 fine. Being of nearly identical weight to the German reichsthaler, British colonists in North America eventually called the Spanish coin the dollar, which became the model for the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar.\nThe rise of German and Spanish dollars in 16th century European trade lessened the demand for French silver \"francs\" and \"testoons\". In 1641 King Louis XIII therefore introduced a new \"Louis d'Argent\" equal to the Spanish dollar and worth three \"livres tournois\", weighing 27.19 g and 0.917 fine. In 1726 France issued its own thaler coin, the silver \"\u00e9cu\" of 6 livres with about 26.7 g fine silver; it would also find currency in Southern Germany and Switzerland as the \"laubthaler\". Finally, in 1795 the French franc was established, with the 5-franc coin of 25.0 g, 90% fine silver being closest in size to the thalers used elsewhere. The French franc system would be expanded to other countries in the advent of the Latin Monetary Union of 1865.\nSwitzerland.\nThe Thirteen Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy and their Associates each minted their own coins, with most larger silver coins conforming to established German or French standards. Thaler and half thaler coins were minted by the cities of Z\u00fcrich (1512), Bern, Lucerne, Zug, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Geneva.\nThe Reformed cities began to represent \"city views\" on the obverse of their thalers, as they did not have the option to represent either patron saint or ruling princes. The first city view thaler of Z\u00fcrich was minted in 1651 (the so-called \"V\u00f6gelitaler\").\nBy the 18th century, Bern and many Western Swiss cantons adopted the French \"\u00e9cu\" or \"laubthaler\" of 26.7 g fine silver as its most widely used thaler, valued at 4 \"livres (francs)\" or 40 \"batzen\" of Bern. In 1798 this system was adopted by the Helvetic Confederation with the first Swiss franc equal to &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20444th an \u00e9cu.\nEventual transition to this first new Swiss franc stalled in the 19th century while public preference shifted to the South German Kronenthaler of 25.71 g fine silver, valued at 3.9 francs or 39 batzen. In 1850 Switzerland established the modern-day Swiss franc at par with the French franc, with 40 Swiss francs exchanged for 7 kronenthaler. The five-franc coin of 25.0 g, 90% fine silver became the coin with the closest value to the different historical thalers.\nScandinavia.\nThe name thaler was introduced to Scandinavia as \"daler\". The first Swedish \"daler\" coins were minted in 1534. The Norwegian \"speciedaler\" was minted from 1560. Later Scandinavian \"daler\" coins included the Swedish riksdaler (1604) and the Danish rigsdaler (1625). In the early 19th century, these countries introduced their modern currency based on the \"daler\" unit. In Norway, \"speciedaler\" was chosen as the currency name in 1816.\nThese currencies in Denmark and Sweden were replaced by the Danish krone and Swedish krona in 1873, the new currencies introduced by the Scandinavian Monetary Union. Norway joined the Monetary Union and introduced the Norwegian krone in 1876.\n19th-century Germany.\nAt the beginning of the 19th century the South German states valued the Conventionsthaler at 2.4 South German gulden, or 9.744 grams fine silver per gulden. Afterwards, however, they began to mint the Kronenthaler valued at 2.7 gulden - hence a reduced fine silver content for the gulden at 9.52 g. In 1837, the Prussian thaler was fixed at 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 South German gulden - hence 9.545 g fine silver per gulden.\nThe North German thaler, valued at &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 a Conventionsthaler or 13&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 to a Cologne Mark fine silver at the start of the 19th century, was revalued in the 1840s at par with the Prussian thaler, at 14 to a Mark, though with varying subdivisions. In 1857, the Vereinsthaler worth 1 North German thaler or 1&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20444 South German gulden was adopted as the standard coin by most German states as well as in the Habsburg Empire. Vereinsthalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria.\nWithin the new German Empire, silver vereinsthaler coins remained unlimited legal tender at a value of 3 German gold marks until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the inflationary period following its defeat in the First World War.\nThe Maria Theresa thaler, the most famous example of the Conventionsthaler minted from 1751, enjoyed a special role as trade currency and continued to be minted long after the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, with coins minted after her death always showing the year 1780. Francis Joseph of Austria declared it an official trade coinage in 1857 just before it lost legal tender status in Austria following issue of the Vereinsthaler. The Maria Theresa taler became the de facto currency of the Ethiopian Empire in the late 18th century, with the Ethiopian birr introduced at par with this taler, and it continued to be in use into the 20th century in the Horn of Africa, Eastern Africa, India and throughout much of the Arabian Peninsula.\nLegacy.\nThough various silver thaler coins were minted in most of Europe until the 1870s, these coins were more often counted in non-thaler currency units like Dutch or Austrian guilders, French francs, Spanish reales, etc. By the mid-19th century the thaler (or reichsthaler, rigsdaler) was still the currency unit used in the North German Confederation and Scandinavia. By 1875 the thaler itself disappeared as currency unit in Europe upon adoption of the gold standard.\nNonetheless, use of the thaler as currency continued outside Europe in the form of the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the various pesos of Spanish America, and the Ethiopian birr. The thaler (and its linguistic variants) would also survive as the informal name of coins identical to the historical coin like the German 3-mark coin, the Dutch 2&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20442-gulden coin, the 5-franc coins of the Latin Monetary Union (among them France, Belgium, Switzerland), and the Greek 5-drachma coin (\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c1\u03bf, taliro).\nThaler-sized coins minted to late-19th century standards would be minted until 1914 in Mexico and in most of Europe, until 1928 in Switzerland, and until 1934 in the United States. Henceforth thaler-sized silver coins would be minted as bullion or numismatic pieces, among them:\nUnrelated to specific coins, the name of the \"thaler\" survives in various modern currency names, in the form \"dollar\" in twenty-three currencies used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and the United States of America, and also in the Samoan t\u0101l\u0101 and the Slovenian tolar (before adoption of the euro).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Hence, formal power series can be viewed as a generalization of polynomials where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite, and differ from usual power series by the absence of convergence requirements, which implies that a formal power series may not represent a function of its variables. Formal power series are in one to one correspondence with their sequences of coefficients, but the two concepts must not be confused, since the operations that can be applied are different.\nA formal power series with coefficients in a ring formula_5 is called a formal power series over formula_6 The formal power series over a ring formula_5 form a ring, commonly denoted by formula_8 (It can be seen as the (\"x\")-adic completion of the polynomial ring formula_9 in the same way as the p-adic integers are the p-adic completion of the ring of the integers.)\nFormal powers series in several indeterminates are defined similarly by replacing the powers of a single indeterminate by monomials in several indeterminates.\nFormal power series are widely used in combinatorics for representing sequences of integers as generating functions. In this context, a recurrence relation between the elements of a sequence may often be interpreted as a differential equation that the generating function satisfies. This allows using methods of complex analysis for combinatorial problems (see analytic combinatorics).\nIntroduction.\nA formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a polynomial, but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with power series (or Taylor series), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of convergence by not assuming that the variable \"X\" denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series\nformula_10\nIf we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its radius of convergence is 1 by the Cauchy\u2013Hadamard theorem. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of coefficients [1, \u22123, 5, \u22127, 9, \u221211, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the factorials [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of \"X\".\nAlgebra on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if\nformula_11\nthen we add \"A\" and \"B\" term by term:\nformula_12\nWe can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular Cauchy product):\nformula_13\nNotice that each coefficient in the product \"AB\" only depends on a \"finite\" number of coefficients of \"A\" and \"B\". For example, the \"X\"5 term is given by\nformula_14\nFor this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of absolute, conditional and uniform convergence which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of analysis.\nOnce we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series \"A\" is a formal power series \"C\" such that \"AC\" = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if \"A\" has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by \"A\"\u22121. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining \"B\"/\"A\" to be the product \"BA\"\u22121, provided that the inverse of \"A\" exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula\nformula_15\nAn important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator formula_16 applied to a formal power series formula_17 in one variable extracts the coefficient of the formula_18th power of the variable, so that formula_19 and formula_20. Other examples include\nformula_21\nSimilarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.\nThe ring of formal power series.\nIf one considers the set of all formal power series in \"X\" with coefficients in a commutative ring \"R\", the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written formula_22 and called the ring of formal power series in the variable\u00a0\"X\" over \"R\".\nDefinition of the formal power series ring.\nOne can characterize formula_23 abstractly as the completion of the polynomial ring formula_24 equipped with a particular metric. This automatically gives formula_23 the structure of a topological ring (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. \nIt is possible to describe formula_23 more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.\nRing structure.\nAs a set, formula_23 can be constructed as the set formula_28 of all infinite sequences of elements of formula_5, indexed by the natural numbers (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index formula_18 is formula_31 by formula_32, one defines addition of two such sequences by\nformula_33\nand multiplication by\nformula_34\nThis type of product is called the Cauchy product of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete convolution. With these operations, formula_28 becomes a commutative ring with zero element formula_36 and multiplicative identity formula_37.\nThe product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds formula_5 into formula_23 by sending any (constant) formula_40 to the sequence formula_41 and designates the sequence formula_42 by formula_43; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as\nformula_44\nthese are precisely the polynomials in formula_43. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence formula_46 by the formal expression formula_47, even though the latter \"is not\" an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as\nformula_48\nand\nformula_49\nwhich is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.\nTopological structure.\nHaving stipulated conventionally that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\none would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in formula_28 is defined and a topology on formula_28 is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.\nInformally, two sequences formula_32 and formula_63 become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of partial sums of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of formula_43 the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values formula_31, since inclusion of the term for formula_66 gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of formula_67. It is also obvious that the limit of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.\nThis topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the ring of formal power series over formula_5 and is denoted by formula_23. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of formula_43 occurs in only finitely many terms.\nThe topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as\nformula_71\nsince only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed formula_67. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1 (in which case the product is nonzero) or infinitely many factors have no constant term (in which case the product is zero).\nAlternative topologies.\nThe above topology is the finest topology for which\nformula_73\nalways converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring formula_5 already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.\nIn the ring of formal power series formula_75, the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate formula_76, since the topology that was put on formula_77 has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So\nformula_78\nconverges (and its sum can be written as formula_79); however\nformula_80\nwould be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of formula_76. This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in formula_76 is given the product topology where each copy of formula_77 is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. With this topology, a sequence of elements of formula_75 converges if the coefficient of each power of formula_76 converges to a formal power series in formula_43, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely. For instance, with this topology, in the second example given above, the coefficient of formula_76converges to formula_88, so the whole summation converges to formula_89.\nThis way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing formula_90 and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial formula_91 stabilizes. This topology, which is also the formula_92-adic topology, where formula_93 is the ideal generated by formula_43 and formula_76, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\nThe same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in formula_96 the limit\nformula_97\ndoes not exist, so in particular it does not converge to\nformula_98\nThis is because for formula_99 the coefficient formula_100 of formula_101 does not stabilize as formula_102. It does however converge in the usual topology of formula_103, and in fact to the coefficient formula_104 of formula_105. Therefore, if one would give formula_96 the product topology of formula_107 where the topology of formula_103 is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to formula_105. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in analysis, while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would \"not\" be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\nUniversal property.\nThe ring formula_23 may be characterized by the following universal property. If formula_111 is a commutative associative algebra over formula_5, if formula_92 is an ideal of formula_111 such that the formula_92-adic topology on formula_111 is complete, and if formula_4 is an element of formula_92, then there is a \"unique\" formula_119 with the following properties:\nOperations on formal power series.\nOne can perform algebraic operations on power series to generate new power series.\nPower series raised to powers.\nFor any natural number \"n\", the nth power of a formal power series S is defined recursively by\nformula_124\nIf \"a\"0 is invertible in the ring of coefficients, one can prove that in the expansion\nformula_125\nthe coefficients are given by formula_126 and\nformula_127\nfor formula_128 if m is invertible in the ring of coefficients.\nIn the case of formal power series with complex coefficients, its complex powers are well defined for series \"f\" with constant term equal to 1. In this case, formula_129 can be defined either by composition with the binomial series (1 + \"x\")\"\u03b1\", or by composition with the exponential and the logarithmic series, formula_130 or as the solution of the differential equation (in terms of series) formula_131 with constant term 1; the three definitions are equivalent. The exponent rules formula_132 and formula_133 easily follow for formal power series \"f\", \"g\".\nMultiplicative inverse.\nThe series\nformula_134\nis invertible in formula_23 if and only if its constant coefficient formula_57 is invertible in formula_5. This condition is necessary, for the following reason: if we suppose that formula_17 has an inverse formula_139 then the constant term formula_140 of formula_141 is the constant term of the identity series, i.e. it is 1. This condition is also sufficient; we may compute the coefficients of the inverse series formula_142 via the explicit recursive formula\nformula_143\nAn important special case is that the geometric series formula is valid in formula_23:\nformula_145\nIf formula_146 is a field, then a series is invertible if and only if the constant term is non-zero, i.e. if and only if the series is not divisible by formula_43. This means that formula_148 is a discrete valuation ring with uniformizing parameter formula_43.\nDivision.\nThe computation of a quotient formula_150\nformula_151\nassuming the denominator is invertible (that is, formula_57 is invertible in the ring of scalars), can be performed as a product formula_153 and the inverse of formula_154, or directly equating the coefficients in formula_155:\nformula_156\nExtracting coefficients.\nThe coefficient extraction operator applied to a formal power series\nformula_157\nin \"X\" is written\nformula_158\nand extracts the coefficient of \"Xm\", so that\nformula_159\nComposition.\nGiven two formal power series\nformula_160\nformula_161\nsuch that formula_162\none may form the \"composition\"\nformula_163\nwhere the coefficients \"c\"\"n\" are determined by \"expanding out\" the powers of \"f\"(\"X\"):\nformula_164\nHere the sum is extended over all (\"k\", \"j\") with formula_165 and formula_166 with formula_167\nSince formula_162 one must have formula_169 and formula_170 for every formula_171 This implies that the above sum is finite and that the coefficient formula_172 is the coefficient of formula_67 in the polynomial formula_174, where formula_175 and formula_176 are the polynomials obtained by truncating the series at formula_177 that is, by removing all terms involving a power of formula_43 higher than formula_179\nA more explicit description of these coefficients is provided by Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula, at least in the case where the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0.\nComposition is only valid when formula_180 has \"no constant term\", so that each formula_172 depends on only a finite number of coefficients of formula_180 and formula_183. In other words, the series for formula_184 converges in the topology of formula_23.\nExample.\nAssume that the ring formula_5 has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in formula_5. If one denotes by formula_105 the formal power series\nformula_189\nthen the equality\nformula_190\nmakes perfect sense as a formal power series, since the constant coefficient of formula_191 is zero.\nComposition inverse.\nWhenever a formal series\nformula_192\nhas \"f\"0 = 0 and \"f\"1 being an invertible element of \"R\", there exists a series\nformula_193\nthat is the composition inverse of formula_153, meaning that composing formula_153 with formula_154 gives the series representing the identity function formula_197. The coefficients of formula_154 may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity \"X\" (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the Lagrange inversion formula (discussed below) provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of \"g\", as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of \"g\".\nFormal differentiation.\nGiven a formal power series\nformula_199\nwe define its formal derivative, denoted \"Df\" or \"f\" \u2032, by\nformula_200\nThe symbol \"D\" is called the formal differentiation operator. This definition simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.\nThis operation is \"R\"-linear:\nformula_201\nfor any \"a\", \"b\" in \"R\" and any \"f\", \"g\" in formula_202 Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual derivative of calculus. For example, the product rule is valid:\nformula_203\nand the chain rule works as well:\nformula_204\nwhenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under composition of series).\nThus, in these respects formal power series behave like Taylor series. Indeed, for the \"f\" defined above, we find that\nformula_205\nwhere \"D\"\"k\" denotes the \"k\"th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating \"k\" times).\nFormal antidifferentiation.\nIf formula_5 is a ring with characteristic zero and the nonzero integers are invertible in formula_5, then given a formal power series\nformula_199\nwe define its formal antiderivative or formal indefinite integral by\nformula_209\nfor any constant formula_210.\nThis operation is \"R\"-linear:\nformula_211\nfor any \"a\", \"b\" in \"R\" and any \"f\", \"g\" in formula_202 Additionally, the formal antiderivative has many of the properties of the usual antiderivative of calculus. For example, the formal antiderivative is the right inverse of the formal derivative:\nformula_213\nfor any formula_214.\nProperties.\nAlgebraic properties of the formal power series ring.\nformula_23 is an associative algebra over formula_5 which contains the ring formula_24 of polynomials over formula_5; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.\nThe Jacobson radical of formula_23 is the ideal generated by formula_43 and the Jacobson radical of formula_5; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.\nThe maximal ideals of formula_23 all arise from those in formula_5 in the following manner: an ideal formula_224 of formula_23 is maximal if and only if formula_226 is a maximal ideal of formula_5 and formula_224 is generated as an ideal by formula_43 and formula_226.\nSeveral algebraic properties of formula_5 are inherited by formula_23:\nTopological properties of the formal power series ring.\nThe metric space formula_241 is complete.\nThe ring formula_23 is compact if and only if \"R\" is finite. This follows from Tychonoff's theorem and the characterisation of the topology on formula_23 as a product topology.\nWeierstrass preparation.\nThe ring of formal power series with coefficients in a complete local ring satisfies the Weierstrass preparation theorem.\nApplications.\nFormal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the Fibonacci numbers, see the article on Examples of generating functions.\nOne can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of formula_244:\nformula_245\nformula_246\nThen one can show that\nformula_247\nformula_248\nformula_249\nThe last one being valid in the ring formula_250\nFor \"K\" a field, the ring formula_251 is often used as the \"standard, most general\" complete local ring over \"K\" in algebra.\nInterpreting formal power series as functions.\nIn mathematical analysis, every convergent power series defines a function with values in the real or complex numbers. Formal power series over certain special rings can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the domain and codomain. Let\nformula_252\nand suppose formula_111 is a commutative associative algebra over formula_5, formula_92 is an ideal in formula_111 such that the I-adic topology on formula_111 is complete, and formula_4 is an element of formula_92. Define:\nformula_260\nThis series is guaranteed to converge in formula_111 given the above assumptions on formula_4. Furthermore, we have\nformula_263\nand\nformula_264\nUnlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.\nSince the topology on formula_23 is the formula_266-adic topology and formula_23 is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have constant coefficients (so that they belong to the ideal formula_266): formula_269, formula_270 and formula_271 are all well defined for any formal power series formula_272\nWith this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series formula_153 whose constant coefficient formula_274 is invertible in formula_5:\nformula_276\nIf the formal power series formula_154 with formula_278 is given implicitly by the equation\nformula_279\nwhere formula_153 is a known power series with formula_281, then the coefficients of formula_154 can be explicitly computed using the Lagrange inversion formula.\nGeneralizations.\nFormal Laurent series.\nThe formal Laurent series over a ring formula_5 are defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree. That is, they are the series that can be written as\nformula_284\nfor some integer formula_285, so that there are only finitely many negative formula_18 with formula_287. (This is different from the classical Laurent series of complex analysis.) For a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer formula_18 such that formula_289 is called the \"order\" of formula_153 and is denoted formula_291 (The order ord(0) of the zero series is formula_292.)\nFor instance, formula_293 is a formal Laurent series of order \u20133.\nMultiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of formula_294 of two series with respective sequences of coefficients formula_295 and formula_296 is\nformula_297\nThis sum has only finitely many nonzero terms because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices.\nThe formal Laurent series form the ring of formal Laurent series over formula_5, denoted by formula_299. It is equal to the localization of the ring formula_23 of formal power series with respect to the set of positive powers of formula_43. If formula_146 is a field, then formula_303 is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the field of fractions of the integral domain formula_148.\nAs with formula_23, the ring formula_299 of formal Laurent series may be endowed with the structure of a topological ring by introducing the metric\nformula_307\nOne may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in the natural (term-by-term) way. Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series formula_153 above is\nformula_311\nwhich is again a formal Laurent series. If formula_153 is a non-constant formal Laurent series and with coefficients in a field of characteristic 0, then one has\nformula_313\nHowever, in general this is not the case since the factor formula_18 for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in formula_5.\nFormal residue.\nAssume that formula_239 is a field of characteristic 0. Then the map\nformula_317\ndefined above is a formula_239-derivation that satisfies\nformula_319\nformula_320\nThe latter shows that the coefficient of formula_321 in formula_153 is of particular interest; it is called \"formal residue of formula_153\" and denoted formula_324. The map\nformula_325\nis formula_239-linear, and by the above observation one has an exact sequence\nformula_327\nSome rules of calculus. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any formula_328\nProperty (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to formula_329. Property (iii): any formula_153 can be written in the form formula_331, with formula_332 and formula_333: then formula_334 formula_333 implies formula_154 is invertible in formula_337 whence formula_338 Property (iv): Since formula_339 we can write formula_340 with formula_341. Consequently, formula_342 and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.\nThe Lagrange inversion formula.\nAs mentioned above, any formal series formula_343 with \"f\"0 = 0 and \"f\"1 \u2260 0 has a composition inverse formula_344 The following relation between the coefficients of \"gn\" and \"f\"\u2212\"k\" holds (\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Lagrange inversion formula\"):\nformula_345\nIn particular, for \"n\"\u00a0=\u00a01 and all \"k\"\u00a0\u2265\u00a01,\nformula_346\nSince the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting one proof here. Noting formula_347, we can apply the rules of calculus above, crucially Rule (iv) substituting formula_348, to get:\nformula_349\nGeneralizations. One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than \"K\"((\"X\")): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the formula_350-modules formula_351 where \u03b1 is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if \"f\" and \"g\" are as above, with formula_352, we can relate the complex powers of \"f\" / \"X\" and \"g\" / \"X\": precisely, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, formula_353 then\nformula_354\nFor instance, this way one finds the power series for complex powers of the Lambert function.\nPower series in several variables.\nFormal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If \"I\" is an index set and \"XI\" is the set of indeterminates \"Xi\" for \"i\"\u2208\"I\", then a monomial \"X\"\"\u03b1\" is any finite product of elements of \"XI\" (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in \"XI\" with coefficients in a ring \"R\" is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials \"X\"\"\u03b1\" to a corresponding coefficient \"c\"\"\u03b1\", and is denoted formula_355. The set of all such formal power series is denoted formula_356 and it is given a ring structure by defining\nformula_357\nand\nformula_358\nTopology.\nThe topology on formula_359 is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial \"X\"\u03b1 the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If \"I\" is finite, then this the \"J\"-adic topology, where \"J\" is the ideal of formula_359 generated by all the indeterminates in \"XI\". This does not hold if \"I\" is infinite. For example, if formula_361 then the sequence formula_362 with formula_363 does not converge with respect to any \"J\"-adic topology on \"R\", but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.\nAs remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like formula_364 is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a topological ring to formula_365\nOperations.\nAll of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.\nIn the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate partial derivative operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.\nUniversal property.\nIn the several variables case, the universal property characterizing formula_366 becomes the following. If \"S\" is a commutative associative algebra over \"R\", if \"I\" is an ideal of \"S\" such that the \"I\"-adic topology on \"S\" is complete, and if \"x\"1, ..., \"xr\" are elements of \"I\", then there is a \"unique\" map formula_367 with the following properties:\nNon-commuting variables.\nThe several variable case can be further generalised by taking \"non-commuting variables\" \"Xi\" for \"i\" \u2208 \"I\", where \"I\" is an index set and then a monomial \"X\"\u03b1 is any word in the \"XI\"; a formal power series in \"XI\" with coefficients in a ring \"R\" is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials \"X\"\u03b1 to a corresponding coefficient \"c\"\u03b1, and is denoted formula_368. The set of all such formal power series is denoted \"R\"\u00ab\"XI\"\u00bb, and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise\nformula_369\nand multiplication by\nformula_370\nwhere \u00b7 denotes concatenation of words. These formal power series over \"R\" form the Magnus ring over \"R\".\nOn a semiring.\nGiven an alphabet formula_371 and a semiring formula_111. The formal power series over formula_111 supported on the language formula_374 is denoted by formula_375. It consists of all mappings formula_376, where formula_374 is the free monoid generated by the non-empty set formula_371.\nThe elements of formula_375 can be written as formal sums\nformula_380\nwhere formula_381 denotes the value of formula_382 at the word formula_383. The elements formula_384 are called the coefficients of formula_382.\nFor formula_386 the support of formula_382 is the set\nformula_388\nA series where every coefficient is either formula_389 or formula_390 is called the characteristic series of its support.\nThe subset of formula_375 consisting of all series with a finite support is denoted by formula_392 and called polynomials.\nFor formula_393 and formula_394, the sum formula_395 is defined by \nformula_396\nThe (Cauchy) product formula_397 is defined by\nformula_398\nThe Hadamard product formula_399 is defined by\nformula_400\nAnd the products by a scalar formula_401 and formula_402 by\nformula_403 and formula_404, respectively.\nWith these operations formula_405 and formula_406 are semirings, where formula_407 is the empty word in formula_374.\nThese formal power series are used to model the behavior of weighted automata, in theoretical computer science, when the coefficients formula_381 of the series are taken to be the weight of a path with label formula_410 in the automata.\nReplacing the index set by an ordered abelian group.\nSuppose formula_411 is an ordered abelian group, meaning an abelian group with a total ordering formula_412 respecting the group's addition, so that formula_413. Let I be a well-ordered subset of formula_411, meaning I contains no infinite descending chain. Consider the set consisting of\nformula_415\nfor all such I, with formula_416 in a commutative ring formula_5, where we assume that for any index set, if all of the formula_416 are zero then the sum is zero. Then formula_419 is the ring of formal power series on formula_411; because of the condition that the indexing set be well-ordered the product is well-defined, and we of course assume that two elements which differ by zero are the same. Sometimes the notation formula_421 is used to denote formula_419.\nVarious properties of formula_5 transfer to formula_419. If formula_5 is a field, then so is formula_419. If formula_5 is an ordered field, we can order formula_419 by setting any element to have the same sign as its leading coefficient, defined as the least element of the index set I associated to a non-zero coefficient. Finally if formula_411 is a divisible group and formula_5 is a real closed field, then formula_419 is a real closed field, and if formula_5 is algebraically closed, then so is formula_419.\nThis theory is due to Hans Hahn, who also showed that one obtains subfields when the number of (non-zero) terms is bounded by some fixed infinite cardinality.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Dutch navigators were the first Europeans known to have explored and mapped the Australian coastline. The first documented encounter was that of Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, in 1606. Dutch seafarers also visited the west and north coasts of the continent, as did French explorers.\nThe most famous expedition was that of Royal Navy Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook, 164 years after Janszoon's sighting. After an assignment to make observations of the 1769 Transit of Venus, Cook followed Admiralty instructions to explore the south Pacific for the reported and on 19 April 1770 sighted the south-eastern coast of Australia and became the first recorded European to explore the eastern coastline. Explorers by land and sea continued to survey the continent for some years after settlement.\nPro-Iberian hypotheses and theories.\nSome writers have advanced the theory that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to sight Australia in the 1520s.\nA number of relics and remains have been interpreted as evidence that the Portuguese reached Australia. The primary evidence advanced to support this theory is the representation of the continent of Jave la Grande, which appears on a series of French world maps, the Dieppe maps, and that may, in part, be based on Portuguese charts. However, most historians do not accept this theory, and the interpretation of the Dieppe maps is highly contentious. In the early 20th century, Lawrence Hargrave argued that Spain had established a colony in Botany Bay in the 16th century. Five coins from the Kilwa Sultanate were found on Marchinbar Island, in the Wessel Islands in 1945 by RAAF radar operator Morry Isenberg. In 2018 another coin, also thought to be from Kilwa, was found on a beach on Elcho Island, another of the Wessel Islands, by archaeologist and member of the Past Masters, Mike Hermes. Hermes speculated that the coins may suggest trade between indigenous Australians and Kilwa, or may have arrived via Makassan contact with Australia. Mike Owen, another member of the Past Masters group speculated that these coins may have arrived sometime after they had installed Muhammad Arcone on the Kilwa throne as a Portuguese vassal, from 1505 to 1506, or that the Portuguese had visited Wessel islands.\nThe French navigator Binot Paulmier de Gonneville claimed to have landed at a land he described as \"east of the Cape of Good Hope\" in 1504, after being blown off course. For some time it had been thought he landed in Australia, but the place he landed has now been shown to be Brazil (which is north-west of the Cape).\n17th century.\nDutch exploration.\nThe most significant exploration of Australia in the 17th century was by the Dutch. The Dutch East India Company (, \"VOC\", \"United East India Company\") was set up in 1602 and traded extensively with the islands which now form parts of Indonesia, and hence were very close to Australia already.\nThe first documented and undisputed European sighting of and landing on Australia was in late February 1606, by the Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon aboard the \"Duyfken.\" Janszoon charted the Australian coast and met with Aboriginal people. Janszoon followed the coast of New Guinea, missed Torres Strait, and explored and then charted part of the western side of Cape York, in the Gulf of Carpentaria, believing the land was still part of New Guinea. On 26 February 1606, Janszoon and his party made landfall near the modern town of Weipa and the Pennefather River, but were promptly attacked by the Indigenous people. Janszoon proceeded down the coast for some . He stopped in some places, but was met by hostile natives and some of his men were killed. At the final place, he initially had friendly relations with the natives, but after he forced them to hunt for him and appropriated some of their women, violence broke out and there were many deaths on both sides. These events were recorded in Aboriginal oral history that has come down to the present day. Here Janszoon decided to turn back, the place later being called Cape Keerweer, Dutch for \"turnabout\".\nThat same year, a Spanish expedition sailing in nearby waters and led by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quiros landed in the New Hebrides and, believing such to be the fabled \"southern continent\", named the land \"Austrialia del Espiritu Santo\" (\"Southern Land of the Holy Spirit\"), in honour of his queen Margaret of Austria, the wife of Philip III of Spain. Later that year, De Quiros' deputy Lu\u00eds Vaez de Torres sailed to the north of Australia through Torres Strait, charting New Guinea's southern coast, and possibly sighting Cape York in October 1606.\nIn 1611 Hendrik Brouwer, working for VOC, discovered that sailing from Europe to Batavia was much quicker if the Roaring Forties were used. Up to that point, the Dutch had followed a route copied from Arab and Portuguese sailors who followed the coasts of Africa, Mauritius and Ceylon. The Brouwer Route involved sailing south from the Cape of Good Hope (which is at 34\u00b0 latitude south) into the Roaring Forties (at 40\u201350\u00b0 latitude south), then sailing east before turning north to Java using the South Indian Ocean Current. The Brouwer Route became compulsory for Dutch vessels in 1617. The problem with the route, however, was that there was no easy way at the time to determine longitude, making Dutch landfalls on the west coast of Australia inevitable, as well as ships becoming wrecked on the shoals. Most of these landfalls were unplanned. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog, employed by VOC, reached land at Shark Bay (on what is now called Dirk Hartog Island) off the coast of Western Australia. Finding nothing of interest, Hartog continued sailing northwards along this coastline of Western Australia previously unknown to Europeans, making nautical charts up to about 22\u00b0 latitude south. He then left the coast and continued on to Batavia. He called Australia \u2014shortened to Eendrachtsland\u2014after his ship, a name which would be in use until Abel Tasman named the land New Holland in 1644.\nIn 1619 Frederik de Houtman, in the VOC ship \"Dordrecht\", and Jacob d'Edel, in another VOC ship \"Amsterdam\", sighted land on the Australian coast near present-day Perth which they called \"d'Edelsland\". After sailing northwards along the coast they made landfall in \"Eendrachtsland\", which had previous been encountered and named by Hartog, before turning for Batavia.\nHessel Gerritsz was appointed on 16 October 1617 as the first exclusive cartographer of VOC, whose job included creating and maintaining charts of coastlines in the area. Gerritsz produced a map in 1622 which showed the first part of Australia to be charted, that by Janszoon in 1606. It was considered to be part of New Guinea and called \"Nueva Guinea\" on the map, but Gerritsz also added an inscription saying: \n\"Those who sailed with the yacht of Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s in the neighbourhood of New Guinea to 10 degrees westward through many islands and shoals and over 2, 3 and 4 fathoms for as many as 40 days, presumed that New Guinea did not extend beyond 10 degrees to the south. If this be so, then the land from 9 to 14 degrees would be a separate land, different from the other New Guinea\".\nAll charts and logs from returning VOC merchants and explorer sailors had to be submitted to Gerritsz and provided new information for several breakthrough maps which came from his hands. Gerritsz' charts would accompany all VOC captains on their voyages. In 1627 Gerritsz made a map, the Caert van't Landt van d'Eendracht, entirely devoted to the discoveries of the West Australian coastline, which was named \"Eendrachtsland\", though the name had been used since 1619.\nOn 1 May 1622, Englishman John Brooke in the \"Tryall\", a British East India Company owned vessel of approximately 500 tons, on the way to Batavia made the second English voyage to use Brouwer's southern route. He sailed too far east and sighted the coastline of Western Australia at Point Cloates (about 22\u00b0 latitude south), although he mistook it for an island sighted in 1618 by Janszoon (and in 1816 named Barrow Island by Phillip Parker King). They did not land there, and a few weeks later were shipwrecked on an uncharted reef northwest of the Montebello Islands (about 20\u00b0 latitude south, now known as Tryal Rocks). The shipwreck caused the deaths of 93 men, but Brooke, his son John and nine men scrambled into a skiff and the ship's factor Thomas Bright and 35 others managed to save a longboat. Brooke sailed separately to Java. Bright and his crew spent seven days ashore on the Montebello Islands, before sailing the longboat to Bantam in Java. This was the first recorded shipwreck in Australian waters and first extended stay in Australia by Europeans.\nIn March 1622, the Dutch galleon Leeuwin, captained by Jan Fransz, mapped parts of the Australian coast between Hamelin Bay and Point D'Entrecasteaux. This was the first European vessel to round what is now called Cape Leeuwin.\nIn 1623, Jan Carstensz was commissioned by VOC to lead an expedition to the southern coast of New Guinea and beyond, to follow up the reports of further land sighted by Janszoon in his 1606 voyages to the south. Setting off from Amboyna in the Dutch East Indies with two ships, the \"Pera\" and \"Arnhem\" (captained by Willem Joosten Van Colster), he traveled along the south coast of New Guinea, then headed south to Cape York Peninsula and the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 14 April 1623, he passed Cape Keerweer. Landing in search of fresh water for his stores, Carstensz encountered a party of the local indigenous Australian inhabitants, who he described as \"poor and miserable looking people\" who had \"no knowledge of precious metals or spices\". On 8 May 1623, Carstensz and his crew fought a skirmish with 200 Aborigines at the mouth of a small river near Cape Duyfken (named after Janszoon's vessel which had earlier visited the region) and landed at the Pennefather River. Carstensz named the small river Carpentier River, and the Gulf of Carpentaria in honour of Pieter de Carpentier, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Carstensz reached the Staaten River before heading north again. The \"Pera\" and Carstensz returned to Amboyna while the \"Arnhem\" crossed the Gulf of Carpentaria, sighting the east coast of Arnhem Land.\nIn 1627, Fran\u00e7ois Thijssen ended up too far south and on 26 January 1627 he came upon the coast of Australia, near Cape Leeuwin, the most south-west tip of the mainland. Pieter Nuyts the VOC official aboard his ship gave Thijssen permission to continue to sail eastwards, mapping more than of the southern coast of Australia from Albany, Western Australia to Ceduna, South Australia. He called the land (\"The Land of Pieter Nuyts\"). Part of Thijssen's map shows the islands St Francis and St Peter, now known collectively with their respective groups as the Nuyts Archipelago. Thijssen's observations were included as early as 1628 by Gerritsz in a chart of the Indies and Eendrachtsland.\nOne Dutch captain of this period who was not really an explorer but who nevertheless bears mentioning was Francisco Pelsaert, captain of the \"Batavia\", which was wrecked off the coast of Western Australia in 1629.\nIn August 1642, VOC despatched Abel Tasman and Franchoijs Visscher on a voyage of which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of \"all the totally unknown provinces of the kingdom of Beach\". This expedition used two small ships, the \"Heemskerck\" and the \"Zeehaen\". Starting in Mauritius both ships left on 8 October using the Roaring Forties to sail east as fast as possible. On 7 November, because of snow and hail the ships' course was altered to a more north-eastern direction. On 24 November 1642 Abel Tasman sighted the west coast of Tasmania, north of Macquarie Harbour. He named his discovery Van Diemen's Land after Antonio van Diemen, Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. Proceeding south he skirted the southern end of Tasmania and turned north-east, Tasman then tried to work his two ships into Adventure Bay on the east coast of South Bruny Island where he was blown out to sea by a storm, this area he named Storm Bay. Two days later Tasman anchored to the north of Cape Frederick Hendrick just north of the Forestier Peninsula. Tasman then landed in Blackman Bay \u2013 in the larger Marion Bay. The next day, an attempt was made to land in North Bay; however, because the sea was too rough the carpenter swam through the surf and planted the Dutch flag in North Bay. Tasman then claimed formal possession of the land on 3 December 1642.\nIn 1644 Tasman made a second voyage with three ships (, , and the tender ). He followed the south coast of New Guinea eastwards, missed the Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia, and continued his voyage westwards along the north Australian coast. He mapped the north coast of Australia making observations on the land, which he called New Holland, and its people. From the point of view of the Dutch East India Company, Tasman's explorations were a disappointment: he had found neither a promising area for trade nor a useful new shipping route.\nBy the end of the Renaissance (1450 to 1650), every continent had been visited and mostly mapped by Europeans, except the south polar continent now known as Antarctica, but originally called Terra Australis, or 'Australia' for short. This geographical achievement was displayed on the large world map \"Nova Totius Terrarum Orbis Tabula\" made by the Dutch cartographer Joan Blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the Peace of Westphalia.\nA map of the world inlaid into the floor of the (\"Burger's Hall\") of the new Amsterdam (\"Town Hall\") in 1648 revealed the extent of Dutch charts of much of Australia's coast. Based on Joan Blaeu's (\"A New and Most Accurate Chart of the Sphere of the Earth\") of the same year, it incorporated Tasman's discoveries. Although the original mosaic was worn flat, it was reproduced in 1748. This reproduction was left in storage for centuries before being restored after World War II as part of the Royal Palace of Amsterdam. It was also used as the basis of another mosaic in Canberra, focused specifically on the Australian section of the map of the eastern hemisphere. Tasman's discoveries also subsequently appeared on the (\"Eastern or Asiatic Archipelago\") published in the (\"Atlas of the Great Elector\").\nMaps from this period and the early 18th century often have or (\"the South Land\") marked as \"New Holland\", the name given to the continent by Abel Tasman in 1644. Joan Blaeu's 1659 map shows the clearly recognizable outline of Australia based on the many Dutch explorations of the first half of the 17th century.\nIn 1664, the French geographer Melchis\u00e9dech Th\u00e9venot published his (\"Relations of Various Interesting Voyages\"), including a map of New Holland. Th\u00e9venot divided the continent in two, between to the west and (\"Southern Land\") to the east. He divided the continent on a line at longitude 135\u00b0 east, which appears to have been on his initiative, as there was no such division in Tasman's journals or on his, Blaeu's, or Amsterdam Burgerzaal's maps or on any other Dutch maps of this period. Instead, or appeared\u2014if at all\u2014as alternative names with in reference to the whole island. This 135\u00b0 E. line seems to have represented Th\u00e9venot's understanding of the Zaragoza Meridian or Tordesillas antimeridian, dividing the Portuguese East Indies conquered by the Dutch Empire in a protracted conflict across the 17th century from the lands reserved under those treaties for the Spanish Empire and reclaimed by the act of possession of \"Austrialia\" carried out by Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Quir\u00f3s in 1606. This western limit of Spain's claim is shown on the 1761 map of the Spanish Empire by Vicente de Memije, (\"Symbolic Presentation of the Spanish World\") and played a part in the British claim and division of the territory during the establishment of New South Wales in the late 18th century and Western Australia in the early 19th century.\nIn 1696, Willem de Vlamingh commanded the rescue mission to Australia's west coast to look for survivors of the \"Ridderschap van Holland\" that had gone missing two years earlier. The mission proved fruitless, but along the way Vlamingh charted parts of the continent's western coast and as a result improved navigation on the Indian Ocean route from the Cape of Good Hope to the Dutch East Indies.\nOthers.\nEnglishman William Dampier came looking for the \"Tryall\" in 1688, 66 years after it was wrecked. Dampier was the first Englishman to set foot on the Australian mainland on 5 January 1688, when his ship the \"Cygnet\" was moored in King Sound. While the ship was being careened he made notes on the fauna and flora and the indigenous peoples he found there. He made another voyage to the region in 1699, before returning to England. He described some of the flora and fauna of Australia, and was the first European to report Australia's peculiar large hopping animals. Dampier contributed to knowledge of Australia's coastline through his two-volume publication \"A Voyage to New Holland\" (1703, 1709). His book of adventures, \"A New Voyage around the World\", created a sensation when it was published in English in 1697. Though he was briefly marooned on the northwest Australian coast on the trip described in this book, only his second voyage seems to be of importance to Australian exploration.\n18th century.\nIn 1756, French King Louis XV sent Louis Antoine de Bougainville to look for the Southern lands. After a stay in South America and the Falklands, Bougainville reached Tahiti in April 1768, where his ship was surrounded by hundreds of canoes filled with beautiful women. \"I ask you\", he wrote, \"given such a spectacle, how could one keep at work 400 Frenchmen?\" He claimed Tahiti for the French and sailed westward, past southern Samoa and the New Hebrides, then on sighting Espiritu Santo turned west still looking for the \"Southern Continent\". On June 4 he almost ran into heavy breakers and had to change course to the north and east. He had almost found the Great Barrier Reef. He sailed through what is now known as the Solomon Islands that, due to the hostility of the people there, he avoided, until his passage was blocked by a mighty reef. With his men weak from scurvy and disease and no way through he sailed for Batavia in the Dutch East Indies where he received news of Wallis and Carteret who had preceded Bougainville. When he returned to France in 1769, he was the first Frenchman to circumnavigate the globe and the first European known to have seen the Great Barrier Reef. Though he did not reach the mainland of Australia, he did eliminate a considerable area where the Southern land was not.\nIn the meantime, in 1768, British Lieutenant James Cook was sent from England on an expedition to the Pacific Ocean to observe the transit of Venus from Tahiti, sailing westwards in via Cape Horn and arriving there in 1769. On the return voyage he continued his explorations of the South Pacific, in search of the postulated continent of Terra Australis. He first reached New Zealand, and then sailed further westwards to sight the south-eastern corner of the Australian continent on 20 April 1770. In doing so, he was to be the first documented European expedition to reach the eastern coastline of Australia. He continued sailing northwards along the east coast, charting and naming many features along the way. He identified Botany Bay as a good harbour and one potentially suitable for a settlement, and where he made his first landfall on 29 April. Continuing up the coastline, the \"Endeavour\" was to later run aground on shoals of the Great Barrier Reef (near the present-day site of Cooktown), where she had to be laid up for repairs. The voyage then recommenced, eventually reaching the Torres Strait. At Possession Island Cook formally claimed possession of the entire east coast he had just explored for Britain. The expedition returned to England via the Indian Ocean and Cape of Good Hope.\nIn 1772, two French expeditions set out to find Terra Australis. The first was led by Marc-Joseph Marion Dufresne who found and named the Crozet Islands. He spent a few days in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) where he made contact with the island's indigenous people (the first European to have done so). In Blackmans Bay he claimed Van Diemen's Land for France on 5 March 1772. He then sailed on to New Zealand where he and some crewmen were killed by M\u0101ori warriors. The survivors retreated to Mauritius. Also in 1772, the two ships of the second French expedition were separated by a storm. The leader turned back but the second in command, Louis Aleno de St Alo\u00fcarn, sighted Cape Leeuwin and followed the Western Australian coast north to Shark Bay. He landed on Dirk Hartog Island and claimed Western Australia in the name of French King Louis\u00a0XV.\nTobias Furneaux on accompanied James Cook (in ) on Cook's second voyage (1772\u20131775), which was commissioned by the British government with advice from the Royal Society, to circumnavigate the globe as far south as possible to finally determine whether there was any great southern landmass, or Terra Australis. On this expedition Furneaux was twice separated from his leader. On the first occasion, in 1773, Furneaux explored a great part of the south and east coasts of Van Diemen's Land, and made the earliest British chart of the same. Most of his names here have survived. On Cook's third voyage (1776\u201380), in 1777 Cook confirmed Furneaux's account and delineation of it, with certain minor criticisms and emendations, and named after him the Furneaux Group at the eastern entrance to Bass Strait, and the group now known as the Low Archipelago.\nCook's first expedition carried botanist Joseph Banks, for whom a great many Australian geographical features and the plant genus \"Banksia\" and a number of plant species, e.g. \"Grevillea banksii\", were named. The reports of Cook and Banks in conjunction with the loss of England's penal colonies in America after they gained independence and growing concern over French activity in the Pacific, encouraged the foundation by the British of a colony at Botany Bay. The First Fleet led by Captain Arthur Phillip left England on 13 May 1787 to found a penal colony in Australia. It reached Botany Bay in mid-January 1788. Phillip had decided to move the settlement to Sydney Cove in Port Jackson, but the British ships were unable to leave Botany Bay until 26 January because of a tremendous gale.\nJust as he was attempting to move the colony, on 24 January 1788 Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse arrived off Botany Bay. The French expedition consisted of two ships led by La P\u00e9rouse, the \"Astrolabe\" and the \"Boussole\", which were on the latest leg of a three-year voyage that had taken them from Brest, around Cape Horn, up the coast from Chile to California, north-west to Kamchatka, south-east to Easter Island, north-west to Macao, and on to the Philippines, the Friendly Isles, Hawaii and Norfolk Island. The gale also prevented La P\u00e9rouse's ships from entering Botany Bay. Though amicably received, the French expedition was a troublesome matter for the British, as it showed the interest of France in the new land. To preempt a French claim to Norfolk Island, Phillip ordered Lieutenant Philip Gidley King to lead a party of 15 convicts and seven free men to take control of Norfolk Island. They arrived on 6 March 1788, while La P\u00e9rouse was still in Sydney.\nThe British received him courteously, and each captain, through their officers, offered the other any assistance and needed supplies. La P\u00e9rouse was 6 weeks in Port Jackson, where the French established an observatory, held Catholic masses, performed geological observations, and planted the first garden. Before leaving Sydney on 10 March, La P\u00e9rouse took the opportunity to send his journals, some charts and also some letters back to Europe with a British naval ship from the First Fleet\u2014the \"Alexander\". Neither La P\u00e9rouse, nor any of his men, were seen again. Fortunately the documents that he dispatched with the \"Alexander\" from the in-progress expedition were returned to Paris, where they were published.\nIn September 1791, the French Assembly decided to send an expedition in search of La P\u00e9rouse, and Bruni d'Entrecasteaux was selected to command the expedition. In 1792, d'Entrecasteaux landed and named Esperance in Western Australia and made many more discoveries and named many other places. The expedition suffered many difficulties, with d'Entrecasteaux dying on 21 July 1793 of scurvy. On 18 February 1794 the expedition vessels were surrendered to the Dutch authorities in the East Indies so that the new French Republican Government could not profit by them. , the most senior surviving officer, sailed from Java in January 1795 on board a Dutch ship taking with him the expedition's papers. The ship left Rossel at Table Bay but took the papers, but was captured by the British. After the Peace of Amiens in 1802, all the expedition papers were returned to Rossel, who was thus able to publish a narrative of the whole enterprise. In 1808 Rossel published the detailed \"Voyage de d'Entrecasteaux, envoy\u00e9 \u00e0 la recherche de Lap\u00e9rouse\" produced by Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Beautemps-Beaupr\u00e9. The atlas contains 39 charts, of which those of Van Diemen's Land were the most detailed, and which remained the source of the English charts for many years. His expedition also resulted in the publication of the first general flora of New Holland.\nLater exploration from the sea.\nIn 1796 (after settlement), British Matthew Flinders with George Bass took a small open boat, the \"Tom Thumb 1\", and explored some of the coastline south of Sydney. He suspected from this voyage that Tasmania was an island, and in 1798 Bass and he led an expedition to circumnavigate it and hence prove his theory. The sea between mainland Australia and Tasmania was named Bass Strait. One of the two major islands in Bass Strait was later named Flinders Island by Philip Parker King. Flinders returned to England in 1801.\nMeantime, in October 1800, Frenchman Nicolas Baudin was selected to lead what has become known as the Baudin expedition to map the coast of Australia/New Holland. He had two ships, \"G\u00e9ographe\" and \"Naturaliste\" captained by Jacques Hamelin, and was accompanied by nine zoologists and botanists, including Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour. He reached Australia in May 1801, being the first to explore and map a part of the southern coast of the continent. The scientific expedition was a great success, with more than 2500 new species described. The French also met Indigenous people and treated them with high respect. Many Western Australian places still have French names today from Baudin's expedition (Peron Peninsula, Depuch Island, Geographe Bay, Cape Naturaliste, Cape Levillain, Boullanger Island and Faure Island). The Australian plant genus \"Lechenaultia\" is named after Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour and \"Guichenotia\" after Antoine Guichenot. In April 1802, the \"Le Naturaliste\" under Hamelin explored the area of Western Port, Victoria, and gave names to places, a number of which have survived. \"Ile des Fran\u00e7ais\" is now called French Island.\nFlinders' work came to the attention of many of the scientists of the day, in particular the influential Sir Joseph Banks, to whom Flinders dedicated his \"Observations on the Coasts of Van Diemen's Land, on Bass's Strait, etc.\". Banks used his influence with Earl Spencer to convince the Admiralty of the importance of an expedition to chart the coastline of New Holland. As a result, in January 1801, Flinders was given command of , a 334-ton sloop, and promoted to commander the following month.\n\"Investigator\" set sail for New Holland on 18 July 1801. Attached to the expedition was the botanist Robert Brown, botanical artist Ferdinand Bauer, and landscape artist William Westall. Due to the scientific nature of the expedition, Flinders was issued with a French passport, despite England and France then being at war. Flinders first sailed along the south coast to Sydney, then completed the circumnavigation of Australia back to Sydney.\nWhile each was charting Australia's coastline, Baudin and Flinders met by chance in April 1802 in Encounter Bay in what is now South Australia. Baudin stopped at the settlement of Sydney for supplies. In Sydney he bought a new ship, the , a smaller vessel which could conduct close inshore survey work, under the command of Louis de Freycinet. He sent home the larger \"Naturaliste\" with all the specimens that had been collected by Baudin and his crew. He then headed for Tasmania and conducted further charting of Bass Strait before sailing west, following the west coast northward, and after another visit to Timor, undertook further exploration along the north coast of Australia. Plagued by contrary winds and ill health, it was decided on 7 July 1803 to return to France. The expedition stopped at Mauritius, where he died of tuberculosis on 16 September 1803. The expedition finally came back to France on 24 March 1804. According to researchers from the University of Adelaide, during this expedition Baudin prepared a report for Napoleon on ways to invade and capture the British colony at Sydney Cove.\nThe British suspected that the reason for Baudin's expedition was to try to establish a French colony on the coast of New Holland. In response, the \"Lady Nelson\" and the whaler \"Albion\", both under direction of Lieutenant John Bowen, sailed from Port Jackson on 31 August 1803 to establish a settlement in Van Diemen's Land, and on 10 October 1803 a convoy of two ships and \"Ocean\" led by Captain David Collins carrying 402 people entered Port Phillip and formed a settlement near Sorrento. The first British to enter the bay were the crews of , commanded by John Murray and, ten weeks later, \"Investigator\", commanded by Flinders, in 1802.\n\"Investigator\" was declared unseaworthy, so in 1803 Flinders was compelled to return to England as a passenger on , together with his charts and logbooks. The vessel stopped in Mauritius, thinking that he would be safe because of the scientific nature of his voyages, though England and France were at war at the time. However, the governor of Mauritius kept Flinders in prison for six and a half years. As a consequence, the first published map of the full outline of Australia was the Freycinet Map of 1811, a product of Baudin's expedition. It preceded the publication of Flinders' map of Australia, \"Terra Australis or Australia\", by three years. Flinders also published in 1814 his account of the voyage in \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\", which was published just before his death at the age of 40.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60022", "revid": "910180", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60022", "title": "Fractal compression", "text": "Compression method for digital images\nFractal compression is a lossy compression method for digital images, based on fractals. The method is best suited for textures and natural images, relying on the fact that parts of an image often resemble other parts of the same image. Fractal algorithms convert these parts into mathematical data called \"fractal codes\" which are used to recreate the encoded image.\nIterated function systems.\nFractal image representation may be described mathematically as an iterated function system (IFS).\nFor binary images.\nWe begin with the representation of a binary image, where the image may be thought of as a subset of formula_1. An IFS is a set of contraction mappings \"\u0192\"1...,\"\u0192N\",\nformula_2\nAccording to these mapping functions, the IFS describes a two-dimensional set \"S\" as the fixed point of the Hutchinson operator\nformula_3\nThat is, \"H\" is an operator mapping sets to sets, and \"S\" is the unique set satisfying \"H\"(\"S\") = \"S\". The idea is to construct the IFS such that this set \"S\" is the input binary image. The set \"S\" can be recovered from the IFS by fixed point iteration: for any nonempty compact initial set \"A\"0, the iteration \"A\"\"k\"+1\u00a0= \"H\"(\"Ak\") converges to \"S\".\nThe set \"S\" is self-similar because \"H\"(\"S\") = \"S\" implies that \"S\" is a union of mapped copies of itself:\nformula_4\nSo we see the IFS is a fractal representation of \"S\".\nExtension to grayscale.\nIFS representation can be extended to a grayscale image by considering the image's graph as a subset of formula_5. For a grayscale image \"u\"(\"x\",\"y\"), consider the set\n\"S\" = {(\"x\",\"y\",\"u\"(\"x\",\"y\"))}. Then similar to the binary case, \"S\" is described by an IFS using a set of contraction mappings \"\u0192\"1...,\"\u0192N\", but in formula_5,\nformula_7\nEncoding.\nA challenging problem of ongoing research in fractal image representation is how to choose the \"\u0192\"1...,\"\u0192N\" such that its fixed point approximates the input image, and how to do this efficiently.\nA simple approach for doing so is the following partitioned iterated function system (PIFS):\nIn the second step, it is important to find a similar block so that the IFS accurately represents the input image, so a sufficient number of candidate blocks for \"Di\" need to be considered. On the other hand, a large search considering many blocks is computationally costly. \nThis bottleneck of searching for similar blocks is why PIFS fractal encoding is much slower than, for example, DCT and wavelet based image representation.\nThe initial square partitioning and brute-force search algorithm presented by Jacquin provides a starting point for further research and extensions in many possible directions\u2014different ways of partitioning the image into range blocks of various sizes and shapes; fast techniques for quickly finding a close-enough matching domain block for each range block rather than brute-force searching, such as fast motion estimation algorithms; different ways of encoding the mapping from the domain block to the range block; etc.\nOther researchers attempt to find algorithms to automatically encode an arbitrary image as RIFS (recurrent iterated function systems) or global IFS, rather than PIFS; and algorithms for fractal video compression including motion compensation and three dimensional iterated function systems.\nFractal image compression has many similarities to vector quantization image compression.\nFeatures.\nWith fractal compression, encoding is extremely computationally expensive because of the search used to find the self-similarities. Decoding, however, is quite fast. While this asymmetry has so far made it impractical for real time applications, when video is archived for distribution from disk storage or file downloads fractal compression becomes more competitive.\nAt common compression ratios, up to about 50:1, fractal compression provides similar results to DCT-based algorithms such as JPEG. At high compression ratios fractal compression may offer superior quality. For satellite imagery, ratios of over 170:1 have been achieved with acceptable results. Fractal video compression ratios of 25:1\u2013244:1 have been achieved in reasonable compression times (2.4 to 66 sec/frame).\nCompression efficiency increases with higher image complexity and color depth, compared to simple grayscale images.\nResolution independence and fractal scaling.\nAn inherent feature of fractal compression is that images become resolution independent after being converted to fractal code. This is because the iterated function systems in the compressed file scale indefinitely. This indefinite scaling property of a fractal is known as \"fractal scaling\".\nFractal interpolation.\nThe resolution independence of a fractal-encoded image can be used to increase the display resolution of an image. This process is also known as \"fractal interpolation\". In fractal interpolation, an image is encoded into fractal codes via fractal compression, and subsequently decompressed at a higher resolution. The result is an up-sampled image in which iterated function systems have been used as the interpolant.\nFractal interpolation maintains geometric detail very well compared to traditional interpolation methods like bilinear interpolation and bicubic interpolation. Since the interpolation cannot reverse Shannon entropy however, it ends up sharpening the image by adding random instead of meaningful detail. One cannot, for example, enlarge an image of a crowd where each person's face is one or two pixels and hope to identify them.\nHistory.\nMichael Barnsley led the development of fractal compression from 1985 at the Georgia Institute of Technology (where both Barnsley and Sloan were professors in the mathematics department). The work was sponsored by DARPA and the Georgia Tech Research Corporation. The project resulted in several patents from 1987. Barnsley's graduate student Arnaud Jacquin implemented the first automatic algorithm in software in 1992. All methods are based on the fractal transform using iterated function systems. Michael Barnsley and Alan Sloan formed Iterated Systems Inc. in 1987 which was granted over 20 additional patents related to fractal compression.\nA major breakthrough for Iterated Systems Inc. was the automatic fractal transform process which eliminated the need for human intervention during compression as was the case in early experimentation with fractal compression technology. In 1992, Iterated Systems Inc. received a US$2.1 million government grant to develop a prototype digital image storage and decompression chip using fractal transform image compression technology.\nFractal image compression has been used in a number of commercial applications: onOne Software, developed under license from Iterated Systems Inc., Genuine Fractals 5 which is a Photoshop plugin capable of saving files in compressed FIF (Fractal Image Format). To date the most successful use of still fractal image compression is by Microsoft in its Encarta multimedia encyclopedia, also under license.\nIterated Systems Inc. supplied a shareware encoder (Fractal Imager), a stand-alone decoder, a Netscape plug-in decoder and a development package for use under Windows. The redistribution of the \"decompressor DLL\" provided by the ColorBox III SDK was governed by restrictive per-disk or year-by-year licensing regimes for proprietary software vendors and by a discretionary scheme that entailed the promotion of the Iterated Systems products for certain classes of other users.\nClearVideo\u00a0\u2013 also known as RealVideo (Fractal)\u00a0\u2013 and SoftVideo were early fractal video compression products. ClearFusion was Iterated's freely distributed streaming video plugin for web browsers. In 1994 SoftVideo was licensed to Spectrum Holobyte for use in its CD-ROM games including Falcon Gold and .\nIn 1996, Iterated Systems Inc. announced an alliance with the Mitsubishi Corporation to market ClearVideo to their Japanese customers. The original ClearVideo 1.2 decoder driver is still supported by Microsoft in Windows Media Player although the encoder is no longer supported.\nTwo firms, Total Multimedia Inc. and Dimension, both claim to own or have the exclusive licence to Iterated's video technology, but neither has yet released a working product. The technology basis appears to be Dimension's U.S. patents 8639053 and 8351509, which have been considerably analyzed. In summary, it is a simple quadtree block-copying system with neither the bandwidth efficiency nor PSNR quality of traditional DCT-based codecs. In January 2016, TMMI announced that it was abandoning fractal-based technology altogether.\nResearch papers between 1997 and 2007 discussed possible solutions to improve fractal algorithms and encoding hardware.\nImplementations.\nA library called \"Fiasco\" was created by Ullrich Hafner. In 2001, \"Fiasco\" was covered in the \"Linux Journal\".\nAccording to the 2000-04 \"Fiasco\" manual, \"Fiasco\" can be used for video compression.\nThe Netpbm library includes the \"Fiasco\" library.\nFemtosoft developed an implementation of fractal image compression in Object Pascal and Java.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60023", "revid": "17675815", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60023", "title": "Airbag", "text": "Vehicle safety device\nAn airbag or supplemental inflatable restraint is a vehicle occupant-restraint system using a bag designed to inflate in milliseconds during a collision and then deflate afterwards. It consists of an airbag cushion, a flexible fabric bag, an inflation module, and an impact sensor. The purpose of the airbag is to provide a vehicle occupant with soft cushioning and restraint during a collision. It can reduce injuries between the flailing occupant and the vehicle's interior.\nThe airbag provides an energy-absorbing surface between the vehicle's occupants and a steering wheel, instrument panel, body pillar, headliner, and windshield. Modern vehicles may contain up to ten airbag modules in various configurations, including driver, passenger, side-curtain, seat-mounted, door-mounted, B- and C-pillar mounted side-impact, knee bolster, inflatable seat belt, and pedestrian airbag modules.\nDuring a crash, the vehicle's crash sensors provide crucial information to the airbag electronic controller unit (ECU), including collision type, angle, and severity of impact. Using this information, the airbag ECU's crash algorithm determines if the crash event meets the criteria for deployment and triggers various firing circuits to deploy one or more airbag modules within the vehicle. Airbag module deployments are activated through a pyrotechnic process designed to be used once as a supplemental restraint system for the vehicle's seat belt systems. Newer side-impact airbag modules consist of compressed-air cylinders that are triggered in the event of a side-on vehicle impact.\nThe first commercial designs were introduced in passenger automobiles during the 1970s. These designs saw limited success and caused some fatalities. Broad commercial adoption of airbags occurred in many markets during the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nActive vs. passive safety.\nAirbags are considered \"passive\" restraints and act as a supplement to \"active\" restraints. Because no action by a vehicle occupant is required to activate or use the airbag, it is considered a \"passive\" device. This is in contrast to seat belts, which are considered \"active\" devices because the vehicle occupant must act to enable them.\nThis terminology is not related to active and passive safety, which are, respectively, systems designed to prevent collisions in the first place, and systems designed to minimize the effects of collisions once they occur. In this use, a car Anti-lock braking system qualifies as an active-safety device, while both its seat belts and airbags qualify as passive-safety devices. Terminological confusion can arise from the fact that passive devices and systems\u2014those requiring no input or action by the vehicle occupant\u2014can operate independently in an active manner; an airbag is one such device. Vehicle safety professionals are generally careful in their use of language to avoid this sort of confusion. However, advertising principles sometimes prevent such semantic caution in the consumer marketing of safety features. Further confusing the terminology, the aviation safety community uses the terms \"active\" and \"passive\" in the \"opposite\" sense from the automotive industry.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe airbag \"for the covering of aeroplane and other vehicle parts\" traces its origins to a United States patent, submitted in 1919 by two dentists from Birmingham, Arthur Parrott and Harold Round. The patent was approved in 1920. Air-filled bladders were in use as early as 1951. The airbag specifically for automobile use is credited independently to the American John W. Hetrick, who filed for an airbag patent on 5 August 1952, that was granted #2,649,311 by the United States Patent Office on 18 August 1953. German patent #896,312 filed for by engineer Walter Linderer on 6 October 1951 was issued on 12 November 1953, approximately three months after American John Hetrick. The airbags proposed by Hetrick and Linderer were based on compressed air released by a spring, bumper contact, or by the driver. Later research during the 1960s showed that compressed air could not inflate the mechanical airbags fast enough to ensure maximum safety, leading to the current chemical and electrical airbags. In patent applications, manufacturers sometimes use the term \"inflatable occupant restraint systems\".\nHetrick was an industrial engineer and member of the United States Navy. His airbag design, however, only came about when he combined his experiences working with navy torpedoes with his desire to protect his family on the road. Despite working with the major automobile manufacturers of his time, Hetrick was unable to attract investment. Although airbags are now required in every automobile sold in the United States, Hetrick's 1951 patent filing serves as an example of a \"valuable\" invention with little economic value to its inventor. Its first commercial use was not implemented until after the patent expired in 1971, at which point the airbag was installed in a few experimental Ford cars.\nIn 1964, a Japanese automobile engineer, (\u5c0f\u5800\u4fdd\u4e09\u90ce), started developing an airbag \"safety net\" system. His design harnessed an explosive to inflate an airbag, for which he was later awarded patents in 14 countries. He died in 1975, before seeing the widespread adoption of airbag systems.\nIn 1967, a breakthrough in developing airbag crash sensors came when Allen K. Breed invented a ball-in-tube mechanism for crash detection. Under his system, an electromechanical sensor with a steel ball attached to a tube by a magnet would inflate an airbag in under 30 milliseconds. A small explosion of sodium azide was used instead of compressed air during inflation for the first time. Breed Corporation then marketed this innovation to Chrysler. A similar \"Auto-Ceptor\" crash-restraint, developed by the Eaton, Yale &amp; Towne company for Ford, was soon also offered as an automatic safety system in the United States, while the Italian Eaton-Livia company offered a variant with localized air cushions.\nIn the early 1970s, General Motors began offering cars equipped with airbags, initially in government fleet-purchased 1973 Chevrolet Impala sedans. These cars came with a 1974-style Oldsmobile instrument panel and a unique steering wheel that contained the driver-side airbag. Two of these cars were crash tested after 20 years and the airbags deployed perfectly. An early example of the airbag cars survives as of 2009. GM's Oldsmobile Toronado was the first domestic U.S. vehicle to include a passenger airbag in 1973. General Motors marketed its first airbag modules under the \"Air Cushion Restraint System\" name, or ACRS. The automaker discontinued the option for its 1977 model year, citing a lack of consumer interest. Ford and GM then spent years lobbying against air-bag requirements, claiming that the devices were unfeasible and inappropriate. Chrysler made driver-side airbags standard on 1988 and 1989 models, but airbags did not become widespread in American cars until the early 1990s.\nAs a substitute for seat belts.\nAirbags for passenger cars were introduced in the United States in the 1970s. When seat-belt usage rates in the country were quite low compared to modern-day, Ford built experimental cars with airbags in 1971. Allstate operated a fleet of 200 Mercury Montereys and showed the reliability of airbags as well as their operation in crash testing, which also was promoted by the insurance company in popular magazine advertisements. General Motors followed in 1973 using full-sized Chevrolet vehicles. The early fleet of experimental GM vehicles equipped with airbags experienced seven fatalities, one of which was later suspected to have been caused by the airbag.\nIn 1974, GM made its ACRS system (which consisted of a padded lower dashboard and a passenger-side air bag) available as a regular production option (RPO code AR3) in full-sized Cadillac, Buick and Oldsmobile models. The GM cars from the 1970s equipped with ACRS had a driver-side airbag, and a driver-side knee restraint. The passenger-side airbag protected both front passengers, and unlike most modern systems, integrated a knee and torso cushion while also having a dual-stage deployment dictated by force of the impact. The cars equipped with ACRS had lap belts for all seating positions, but lacked shoulder belts. Shoulder belts were already mandatory in the United States on closed cars without airbags for the driver and outer front passenger, but GM chose to market its airbags as a substitute for shoulder belts. Prices for this option on Cadillac models were US$225 in 1974, $300 in 1975, and $340 in 1976 (US$ in 2024 dollars ).\nThe early development of airbags coincided with international interest in automobile safety legislation. Some safety experts advocated a performance-based occupant-protection standard rather than one mandating a particular technical solution (which could rapidly become outdated and prove to not be a cost-effective approach). Less emphasis was placed on other designs as countries successfully mandated seat belt restrictions, however.\nAs a supplemental restraint system.\nFrontal airbag.\nThe auto industry and research and regulatory communities have moved away from their initial view of the airbag as a seat-belt replacement, and the bags are now nominally designated as supplemental restraint systems (SRS) or supplemental inflatable restraints.\nIn 1981, Mercedes-Benz introduced the airbag in West Germany as an option on its flagship saloon model, S-Class (W126). In the Mercedes system, the sensors automatically tensioned the seat belts to reduce occupants' motion on impact and then deployed the airbag on impact. This integrated the seat belts and the airbag into a restraint system, rather than the airbag being considered an alternative to the seat belt.\nIn 1987, the Porsche 944 Turbo became the first car to have driver and passenger airbags as standard equipment. The Porsche 944 and 944S had this as an available option. The same year also had the first airbag in a Japanese car, the Honda Legend.\nIn 1988, Chrysler became the first United States automaker to fit a driver-side airbag as standard equipment, which was offered in six different models. The following year, Chrysler became the first US auto manufacturer to offer driver-side airbags in all its new passenger models. Chrysler also began featuring the airbags in advertisements showing how the devices had saved lives that helped the public know the value of them and safety became a selling advantage in the late 1980s. All versions of the Chrysler minivans came with airbags starting for the 1991 model year. In 1993, The Lincoln Motor Company boasted that all vehicles in their model line were equipped with dual airbags, one for the driver's side and another for the passenger's side. The 1993 Jeep Grand Cherokee became the first SUV to offer a driver-side airbag when it was launched in 1992. Driver and passenger airbags became standard equipment in all Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde sedans ahead of any safety regulations. Early 1993 saw the 4-millionth airbag-equipped Chrysler vehicle roll off the assembly line. In October 1993, the Dodge Ram became the first pickup truck with a standard driver-side airbag.\nThe first known collision between two airbag-equipped automobiles took place on 12 March 1990 in Virginia, USA. A 1989 Chrysler LeBaron crossed the center line and hit another 1989 Chrysler LeBaron in a head-on collision, causing both driver airbags to deploy. The drivers suffered only minor injuries despite extensive damage to the vehicles.\nThe United States Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 required passenger cars and light trucks built after 1 September 1998 to have airbags for the driver and the front passenger. In the United States, NHTSA estimated that airbags had saved over 4,600 lives by 1 September 1999; however, the crash deployment experience of the early 1990s installations indicated that some fatalities and serious injuries were in fact caused by airbags. In 1998, NHTSA initiated new rules for advanced airbags that gave automakers more flexibility in devising effective technological solutions. The revised rules also required improved protection for occupants of different sizes regardless of whether they use seat belts, while minimizing the risk to infants, children, and other occupants caused by airbags.\nIn Europe, airbags were almost unheard of until the early 1990s. By 1991, four manufacturers \u2013 BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, and Volvo \u2013 offered the airbag on some of their higher-end models, but shortly afterward, airbags became a common feature on more mainstream cars, with Ford and Vauxhall/Opel among the manufacturers to introduce the airbag to its model ranges in 1992. Citro\u00ebn, Fiat, Nissan, Hyundai, Peugeot, Renault, and Volkswagen followed shortly afterwards.\nBy 1999, finding a new mass-market car without an airbag at least as optional equipment was difficult, and some late 1990s products, such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk4, also featured side airbags. The Peugeot 306 is one example of the European automotive mass-market evolution: starting in early 1993, most of these models did not even offer a driver's airbag as an option, but by 1999, even side airbags were available on several variants. Audi was late to offer airbag systems on a broader scale, since even in the 1994 model year, its popular models did not offer airbags. Instead, the German automaker until then relied solely on its proprietary cable-based procon-ten restraint system.\nVariable force-deployment front airbags were developed to help minimize injury from the airbag itself.\nThe emergence of the airbag has contributed to a sharp decline in the number of deaths and serious injuries on the roads of Europe since 1990, and by 2010, the number of cars on European roads lacking an airbag represented a very small percentage of cars, mostly the remaining cars dating from the mid-1990s or earlier.\nMany new cars in Latin America, including the Kia Rio, Kia Picanto, Hyundai Grand i10, Mazda 2, Chevrolet Spark and the Chevrolet Onix, are often sold without airbags, as neither airbags nor automatic braking systems in new cars are compulsory in many Latin American countries. Some require the installation of a minimum of only two airbags in new cars which many in this market have.\nShape of airbags.\nThe Citro\u00ebn C4 provided the first \"shaped\" driver airbag, made possible by this car's unusual fixed-hub steering wheel.\nIn 2019, Honda announced it would introduce a new front passenger airbag technology. Developed by Autoliv and Honda R&amp;D in Ohio, United States, this new airbag design features three inflatable chambers connected across the front by a \"noninflatable sail panel.\" The two outer chambers are larger than the middle chamber. When the airbag deploys, the sail panel cushions the occupant's head from the impact of hitting the airbag, and the three chambers hold the occupant's head in place, like a catcher's mitt. The goal of the tri-chamber airbag is to help \"arrest high-speed movement\" of the head, thereby reducing the likelihood of concussion injuries in a collision. The first vehicle to come with the tri-chamber airbag installed from the factory was in 2020 (for the 2021 model year) for the Acura TLX. Honda hopes that the new technology will soon make its way to all vehicles.\nRear airbag.\nMercedes began offering rear passengers protection in frontal collisions in September 2020 (for the 2021 model year) for the Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W223). The W223 S-Class is the first car equipped with rear seat airbags that use gas to inflate supporting structures that unfold and extend a bag that fills with ambient air, instead of conventional fully gas-inflated airbags that are widely used in automotive airbag systems.\nSide airbag.\nEssentially, two types of side airbags are commonly used today - the side-torso airbag and the side-curtain airbag. More recently, center airbags are becoming more common in the European market.\nMost vehicles equipped with side-curtain airbags also include side-torso airbags. However, some, such as the Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007\u201309 model Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra, and 2009\u201312 Dodge Ram do not feature the side-torso airbag.\nFrom around 2000, side-impact airbags became commonplace on even low- to mid-range vehicles, such as the smaller-engined versions of the Ford Fiesta and Peugeot 206, and curtain airbags were also becoming regular features on mass-market cars. The Toyota Avensis, launched in 2003, was the first mass-market car to be sold in Europe with nine airbags.\nSide torso airbag.\nSide-impact airbags or side-torso airbags are a category of airbags usually located in the seat or door panel, and inflate between the seat occupant and the door. These airbags are designed to reduce the risk of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions. Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes. More recent side-airbag designs include a two-chamber system; a firmer lower chamber for the pelvic region and softer upper chamber for the ribcage.\nSwedish company Autoliv AB was granted a patent on side-impact airbags, and they were first offered as an option in 1994 on the 1995 Volvo 850, and as standard equipment on all Volvo cars made after 1995.\nIn 1997, Saab introduced the first combined head and torso airbags with the launch of the Saab 9-5.\nSome cars, such as the 2010 Volkswagen Polo Mk.5 have combined head- and torso-side airbags. These are fitted in the backrest of the front seats and protect the head and the torso.\nSide tubular or curtain airbag.\nIn 1997, the BMW 7 Series and 5 Series were fitted with tubular-shaped head side airbags (inflatable tubular structure), the \"Head Protection System (HPS)\" as standard equipment. This airbag was designed to offer head protection in side impact collisions and also maintained inflation for up to seven seconds for rollover protection. However, this tubular-shaped airbag design has been quickly replaced by an inflatable 'curtain' airbag.\nIn May 1998, Toyota began offering a side-curtain airbag deploying from the roof on the Progr\u00e9s. In 1998, the Volvo S80 was given roof-mounted curtain airbags to protect both front and rear passengers. Curtain airbags were then made standard equipment on all new Volvo cars from 2000 except for the first-generation C70, which received an enlarged side-torso airbag that also protects the head of front-seat occupants. The second-generation C70 convertible received the world's first door-mounted, side-curtain airbags that deployed upwards.\nCurtain airbags have been said to reduce brain injury or fatalities by up to 45% in a side impact with an SUV. These airbags come in various forms (e.g., tubular, curtain, door-mounted) depending on the needs of the application. Many recent SUVs and MPVs have a long inflatable curtain airbag that protects all rows of seats.\nIn many vehicles, the curtain airbags are programmed to deploy during some/all frontal impacts to manage passenger kinetics (e.g. head hitting B-pillar on the rebound), especially in offset crashes such as the IIHS's small overlap crash test.\nRoll-sensing curtain airbag (RSCA).\nRoll-sensing curtain airbags are designed to stay inflated for a longer duration of time, cover a larger proportion of the window, and be deployed in a roll-over crash. They offer protection to occupants' heads and help to prevent ejection. SUVs and pickups are more likely to be equipped with RSCAs due to their higher probability of rolling over and often a switch can disable the feature in case the driver wants to take the vehicle off-road.\nCenter airbag.\nIn 2009, Toyota developed the first production rear-seat center airbag designed to reduce the severity of secondary injuries to rear passengers in a side collision. This system deploys from the rear center seat first appearing in on the Crown Majesta. In late 2012, General Motors with supplier Takata introduced a front center airbag; it deploys from the driver's seat.\nHyundai Motor Group announced its development of a center-side airbag on September 18, 2019, installed inside the driver's seat.\nSome Volkswagen vehicles in 2022 equipped with center airbags include the ID.3 and the Golf.\nThe Polestar 2 also includes a center airbag.\nWith EuroNCAP updating its testing guidelines in 2020, European and Australian market vehicles increasingly use front-center airbags, rear torso airbags, and rear seat belt pre-tensioners.\nKnee airbag.\nThe second driver-side and separate knee airbag was used in the Kia Sportage SUV and has been standard equipment since then. The airbag is located beneath the steering wheel.\nThe Toyota Caldina introduced the first driver-side SRS knee airbag on the Japanese market in 2002. Toyota Avensis became the first vehicle sold in Europe equipped with a driver's knee airbag. The EuroNCAP reported on the 2003 Avensis, \"There has been much effort to protect the driver's knees and legs and a knee airbag worked well.\" Since then certain models have also included front-passenger knee airbags, which deploy near or over the glove compartment in a crash. Knee airbags are designed to reduce leg injury. The knee airbag has become increasingly common since 2000.\nRear curtain airbag.\nIn 2008, the new Toyota iQ microcar featured the first production rear-curtain shield airbag to protect the rear occupants' heads in the event of a rear-end impact.\nSeat cushion airbag.\nAnother feature of the Toyota iQ was a seat-cushion airbag in the passenger seat to prevent the pelvis from diving below the lap belt during a frontal impact or submarining. Later Toyota models such as the Yaris added the feature to the driver's seat, as well.\nSeat-belt airbag.\nThe seat-belt airbag is designed to better distribute the forces experienced by a buckled person in a crash using an increased seat belt area. This is done to reduce possible injuries to the rib cage or chest of the belt wearer.\nCessna Aircraft also introduced seat belt airbags. They are as of 2003 standard on the 172, 182, and 206.\nPedestrian airbag.\nAirbag(s) mounted to the exterior of vehicles, so-called \"pedestrian airbags\", are designed to reduce injuries in the event of a vehicle to a pedestrian collision. When a collision is detected the airbag will deploy and cover hard areas, such as a-pillars and bonnet edges, before they can be struck by the pedestrian. \nWhen introduced in 2012 the Volvo V40 included the world's first pedestrian airbag as standard. As a result, the V40 ranked highest (88%) in the EuroNCAP's pedestrian tests.\nManufacturers.\nSuppliers of SRS airbags include Autoliv, Daicel, TRW, and JSS (which owns Breed, Key Safety Systems, and Takata). The majority of impact sensors of airbags are manufactured by the Lanka Harness Company.\nOperation.\nThe airbags in the vehicle are controlled by a central airbag control unit (ACU), a specific type of ECU. The ACU monitors several related sensors within the vehicle, including accelerometers, impact sensors, side (door) pressure sensors, wheel speed sensors, gyroscopes, brake pressure sensors, and seat occupancy sensors. Oftentimes, ACUs log this\u2014and other\u2014sensor data in a circular buffer and record it to onboard non-volatile memory, to provide a snapshot of the crash event for investigators. As such, an ACU frequently functions as the vehicle's event data recorder (EDR); not all EDRs are ACUs, and not all ACUs include EDR features.15 An ACU typically includes capacitors within its circuitry, so that the module remains powered and able to deploy the airbags if the vehicle's battery connection to the ACU is severed during a crash.1023\nThe bag itself and its inflation mechanism are concealed within the steering wheel boss (for the driver), or the dashboard (for the front passenger), behind plastic flaps or doors that are designed to tear open under the force of the bag inflating. Once the requisite threshold has been reached or exceeded, the airbag control unit will trigger the ignition of a gas generator propellant to rapidly inflate a fabric bag. As the vehicle occupant collides with and squeezes the bag, the gas escapes in a controlled manner through small vent holes. The airbag's volume and the size of the vents in the bag are tailored to each vehicle type, to spread out the deceleration of (and thus force experienced by) the occupant over time and over the occupant's body, compared to a seat belt alone.\nThe signals from the various sensors are fed into the airbag control unit, which determines from them the angle of impact, the severity, or the force of the crash, along with other variables. Depending on the result of these calculations, the ACU may also deploy various additional restraint devices, such as seat belt pre-tensioners, and/or airbags (including frontal bags for driver and front passenger, along with seat-mounted side bags, and \"curtain\" airbags which cover the side glass). Each restraint device is typically activated with one or more pyrotechnic devices, commonly called an initiator or electric match. The electric match, which consists of an electrical conductor wrapped in a combustible material, activates with a current pulse between in less than 2 milliseconds. When the conductor becomes hot enough, it ignites the combustible material, which initiates the gas generator. In a seat belt pre-tensioner, this hot gas is used to drive a piston that pulls the slack out of the seat belt. In an airbag, the initiator is used to ignite solid propellant inside the airbag inflator. The burning propellant generates inert gas which rapidly inflates the airbag in approximately . An airbag must inflate quickly to be fully inflated by the time the forward-traveling occupant reaches its outer surface. Typically, the decision to deploy an airbag in a frontal crash is made within after the onset of the crash, and both the driver and passenger airbags are fully inflated within approximately after the first moment of vehicle contact. If an airbag deploys too late or too slowly, the risk of occupant injury from contact with the inflating airbag may increase. Since more distance typically exists between the passenger and the instrument panel, the passenger airbag is larger and requires more gas to fill it.\nOlder airbag systems contained a mixture of sodium azide (), , and . A typical driver-side airbag contains approximately of , with the larger passenger-side airbag containing about . Within about 40 milliseconds of impact, all these components react in three separate reactions that produce nitrogen gas. The reactions, in order, are as follows.\nThe first two reactions create 4 molar equivalents of nitrogen gas, and the third converts the remaining reactants to relatively inert potassium silicate and sodium silicate.\nModern airbags use guanidine nitrate to generate gas through the following reaction:\nThere are ongoing efforts to find alternative compounds so that airbags have less toxic reactants. The reaction of the Sr complex nitrate, () of carbohydrazide (SrCDH) with various oxidizing agents results in the evolution of and gases. The and gases evolved made up 99% of all gases evolved. Nearly all of the starting materials will not decompose until reaching temperatures of or higher, so this could be a viable option as an airbag gas generator.\nSince airbags deploy only once and deflate quickly after the initial impact, they will not be beneficial during a subsequent collision.\nIn vehicles equipped with a rollover sensing system, accelerometers, and gyroscopes are used to sense the onset of a rollover event. If a rollover event is determined to be imminent, side-curtain airbags are deployed to help protect the occupant from contact with the side of the vehicle interior, and also to help prevent occupant ejection as the vehicle rolls over.\nTriggering conditions.\nAirbags are designed to deploy in frontal and near-frontal collisions more severe than a threshold defined by the regulations governing vehicle construction in whatever particular market the vehicle is intended for: United States regulations require deployment in crashes at least equivalent in deceleration to a barrier collision, or similarly, striking a parked car of similar size across the full front of each vehicle at about twice the speed. International regulations are performance-based, rather than technology-based, so airbag deployment threshold is a function of overall vehicle design.\nUnlike crash tests into barriers, real-world crashes typically occur at angles other than directly into the front of the vehicle, and the crash forces usually are not evenly distributed across the front of the vehicle. Consequently, the relative speed between a striking and struck vehicle required to deploy the airbag in a real-world crash can be much higher than an equivalent barrier crash. Because airbag sensors measure deceleration, the vehicle speed is not a good indicator of whether an airbag should be deployed. Airbags can deploy due to the vehicle's undercarriage striking a low object protruding above the roadway due to the resulting deceleration.\nThe airbag sensor is a MEMS accelerometer, which is a small integrated circuit with integrated micromechanical elements. The microscopic mechanical element moves in response to rapid deceleration, and this motion causes a change in capacitance, which is detected by the electronics on the chip that then sends a signal to fire the airbag. The most common MEMS accelerometer in use is the ADXL-50 by Analog Devices, but there are other MEMS manufacturers as well.\nInitial attempts using mercury switches did not work well. Before MEMS, the primary system used to deploy airbags was called a \"rolamite\". A rolamite is a mechanical device, consisting of a roller suspended within a tensioned band. As a result of the particular geometry and material properties used, the roller is free to translate with little friction or hysteresis. This device was developed at Sandia National Laboratories. Rolamite and similar macro-mechanical devices were used in airbags until the mid-1990s after which they were universally replaced with MEMS.\nNearly all airbags are designed to automatically deploy in the event of a vehicle fire when temperatures reach . This safety feature, often termed auto-ignition, helps to ensure that such temperatures do not cause an explosion of the entire airbag module.\nToday, airbag triggering algorithms are much more complex, being able to adapt the deployment speed to the crash conditions, and prevent unnecessary deployments. The algorithms are considered valuable intellectual property. Experimental algorithms may take into account such factors as the weight of the occupant, the seat location, and seat belt use, as well as even attempt to determine if a baby seat is present.\nInflation.\nWhen the frontal airbags are to deploy, a signal is sent to the gas generator|inflator unit within the airbag control unit. An igniter starts a rapid chemical reaction generating primarily nitrogen gas () to fill the airbag making it deploy through the module cover. Some airbag technologies use compressed nitrogen or argon gas with a pyrotechnic operated valve (\"hybrid gas generator\"), while other technologies use various energetic propellants. Although propellants containing the highly toxic sodium azide () were common in early inflator designs, little to no toxic sodium azide has been found on used airbags.\nThe azide-containing pyrotechnic gas generators contain a substantial amount of the propellant. The driver-side airbag would contain a canister containing about of sodium azide. The passenger side container holds about of sodium azide.\nFrom the onset of the crash, the entire deployment and inflation process is about 0.04 seconds. Because vehicles change speed so quickly in a crash, airbags must inflate rapidly to reduce the risk of the occupant hitting the vehicle's interior.\nVariable-force deployment.\nAdvanced airbag technologies are being developed to tailor airbag deployment to the severity of the crash, the size, and posture of the vehicle occupant, belt usage, and how close that person is to the actual airbag. Many of these systems use multi-stage inflators that deploy less forcefully in stages in moderate crashes than in very severe crashes. Occupant sensing devices let the airbag control unit know if someone is occupying a seat adjacent to an airbag, the mass/weight of the person, whether a seat belt or child restraint is being used, and whether the person is forward in the seat and close to the airbag. Based on this information and crash severity information, the airbag is deployed at either a high force level, a less forceful level, or not at all.\nAdaptive airbag systems may utilize multi-stage airbags to adjust the pressure within the airbag. The greater the pressure within the airbag, the more force the airbag will exert on the occupants as they come in contact with it. These adjustments allow the system to deploy the airbag with a moderate force for most collisions; reserving the maximum force airbag only for the severest of collisions. Additional sensors to determine the location, weight or relative size of the occupants may also be used. Information regarding the occupants and the severity of the crash are used by the airbag control unit, to determine whether airbags should be suppressed or deployed, and if so, at various output levels.\nPost-deployment.\nA chemical reaction produces a burst of nitrogen to inflate the bag. Once an airbag deploys, deflation begins immediately as the gas escapes through vent(s) in the fabric (or, as it is sometimes called, the cushion) and cools. Deployment is frequently accompanied by the release of dust-like particles, and gases in the vehicle's interior (called effluent). Most of this dust consists of cornstarch, french chalk, or talcum powder, which are used to lubricate the airbag during deployment.\nNewer designs produce effluent primarily consisting of harmless talcum powder/cornstarch and nitrogen gas. In older designs using an azide-based propellant (usually ), varying amounts of sodium hydroxide nearly always are initially present. In small amounts this chemical can cause minor irritation to the eyes and/or open wounds; however, with exposure to air, it quickly turns into sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). However, this transformation is not 100% complete, and invariably leaves residual amounts of hydroxide ions from NaOH. Depending on the type of airbag system, potassium chloride may also be present.\nFor most people, the only effect the dust may produce is some minor irritation of the throat and eyes. Generally, minor irritations only occur when the occupant remains in the vehicle for many minutes with the windows closed and no ventilation. However, some people with asthma may develop a potentially lethal asthmatic attack from inhaling the dust.\nBecause of the airbag exit flap design of the steering wheel boss and dashboard panel, these items are not designed to be recoverable if an airbag deploys, meaning that they have to be replaced if the vehicle has not been written off in a collision. Moreover, the dust-like particles and gases can cause irreparable cosmetic damage to the dashboard and upholstery, meaning that minor collisions that result in the deployment of airbags can be costly, even if there are no injuries and there is only minor damage to the vehicle structure.\nRegulatory specifications.\nUnited States.\nOn 11 July 1984, the United States government amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208) to require cars produced after 1 April 1989 to be equipped with a passive restraint for the driver. An airbag or an automatic seat belt would meet the requirements of the standard. Airbag introduction was stimulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. However, airbags were not mandatory on light trucks until 1997.\nIn 1998, FMVSS 208 was amended to require dual front airbags, and reduced-power, second-generation airbags were also mandated. This was due to the injuries caused by first-generation airbags, though FMVSS 208 continues to require that bags be engineered and calibrated to be able to \"save\" the life of an \"unbelted\" 50th-percentile size and weight \"male\" crash test dummy. The technical performance and validation requirements for the inflator assembly used in airbag modules are specified in SAE USCAR 24\u20132.\nEurope.\nSome countries outside North America adhere to internationalized European ECE vehicle and equipment regulations rather than the United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. ECE airbags are generally smaller and inflate less forcefully than United States airbags because the ECE specifications are based on \"belted\" crash test dummies.\nThe Euro NCAP vehicle safety rating encourages manufacturers to take a comprehensive approach to occupant safety; a good rating can only be achieved by combining airbags with other safety features. Almost every new car sold in Europe is equipped with front and side airbags, but in the European Union in 2020 and in the United Kingdom, and most other developed countries there is no direct legal requirement for new cars to feature airbags.\nCentral and South America.\nEcuador requires dual front airbags in new car models since 2013.\nSince January 2014, except for micro vehicles, all new cars made or imported in Argentina must have front airbags.\nSince 1 January 2014, all new cars sold in Brazil must have dual front airbags.\nSince July 2014, all new cars sold in Uruguay must have dual front airbags.\nSince December 2016, all new cars sold in Chile must have dual front airbags.\nSince 1 January 2017, all cars made or imported in Colombia must have dual front airbags.\nSince 1 January 2020, all new cars sold in Mexico must have dual front airbags.\nIndia.\nOn 5 March 2021, the Indian Ministry of Road Transport and Highways mandated that all new vehicle models introduced in India after 1 April 2021 have dual front airbags; the regulation also requires that all existing models be equipped with dual front airbags by 31 August 2021.\nIndia also mandated that all passenger vehicles sold after October 2023 must have a minimum of six airbags.\nMaintenance.\nInadvertent airbag deployment while the vehicle is being serviced can result in severe injury, and an improperly installed or defective airbag unit may not operate or perform as intended. Those servicing a vehicle, as well as first responders, must exercise extreme awareness, as many airbag control systems may remain powered for roughly 30 minutes after disconnecting the vehicle's battery.3 Some countries impose restrictions on the sale, transport, handling, and service of airbags and system components. In Germany, airbags are regulated as harmful explosives; only mechanics with special training are allowed to service airbag systems.\nSome automakers (such as Mercedes-Benz) call for the replacement of undeployed airbags after a certain time to ensure their reliability in a collision. One example is the 1992 S500, which has an expiry date sticker attached to the door pillar. Some \u0160koda vehicles indicate an expiry date of 14 years from the date of manufacture. In this case, replacement would be uneconomic as the car would have negligible value at 14 years old, far less than the cost of fitting new airbags. Volvo has stated that \"airbags do not require replacement during the lifetime of the vehicle,\" though this cannot be taken as a guarantee on the device.\nLimitations.\nAlthough the millions of installed airbags in use have an excellent safety record, some limitations on their ability to protect car occupants exist. The original implementation of front airbags did little to protect against side collisions, which can be more dangerous than frontal collisions because the protective crumple zone in front of the passenger compartment is completely bypassed. Side airbags and protective airbag curtains are increasingly being required in modern vehicles to protect against this very common category of collisions.\nAirbags are designed to deploy once only, so are ineffective if any further collisions occur after an initial impact. Multiple impacts may occur during rollovers or other incidents involving multiple collisions, such as many multivehicle collisions.\nAn extremely dangerous situation occurs during \"underride collisions\", in which a passenger vehicle collides with the rear of a tractor-trailer lacking a rear underride guard, or hits the side of such a trailer not equipped with a side underride guard. The platform bed of a typical trailer is roughly at the head height of a seated adult occupant of a typical passenger car. This means not much of a barrier exists between a head and the edge of the trailer platform, except a glass windshield. In an underride collision, the car's crush zones designed to absorb collision energy are completely bypassed, and the airbags may not deploy in time because the car does not decelerate appreciably until the windshield and roof pillars have already impacted the trailer bed. Even delayed inflation of airbags may be useless because of major intrusion into the passenger space, leaving occupants at high risk of major head trauma or decapitation in even low-speed collisions. Western European standards for underride guards have been stricter than North American standards, which typically have allowed grandfathering of older equipment that may still be on the road for decades.\nTypical airbag systems are completely disabled by turning off the ignition key. Unexpected turnoffs usually also disable the engine, power steering, and power brakes, and can be the direct cause of a collision. If a violent collision occurs, the disabled airbags will not deploy to protect vehicle occupants. In 2014, General Motors admitted to concealing information about fatal collisions caused by defective ignition switches that would abruptly shut down a car (including its airbags). Between 13 and 74 deaths have been directly attributed to this defect, depending on how the fatalities are classified.\nInjuries and fatalities.\nUnder some rare conditions, airbags can injure and in some very rare instances kill vehicle occupants. To provide crash protection for occupants not wearing seat belts, United States airbag designs trigger much more forcefully than airbags designed to the international ECE standards used in most other countries. Recent \"smart\" airbag controllers can recognize if a seat belt is used, and alter the airbag cushion deployment parameters accordingly.\nIn 1990, the first automotive fatality attributed to an airbag was reported. TRW produced the first gas-inflated airbag in 1994, with sensors and low inflation-force bags becoming common soon afterward. Dual-depth (also known as dual-stage) airbags appeared on passenger cars in 1998. By 2005, deaths related to airbags had declined, with no adult deaths and two child deaths attributed to airbags that year. However, injuries remain fairly common in collisions with airbag deployment.\nSerious injuries are less common, but severe or fatal injuries can occur to vehicle occupants very near an airbag or in direct contact when it deploys. Such injuries may be sustained by unconscious drivers slumped over the steering wheel, unrestrained or improperly restrained occupants who slide forward in the seat during precrash braking, and properly belted drivers sitting very close to the steering wheel. A good reason for the driver not to cross hands over the steering wheel, a rule taught to most learner drivers, but quickly forgotten by most, is that an airbag deployment while negotiating a turn may result in the driver's hand(s) being driven forcefully into their face, exacerbating any injuries from the airbag alone.\nA US study showed that the risk for a serious head injury occurring is 5.495% while travelling . The risk is reduced for passengers to 4.435%. This risk is lowered by 80.5% to 1.073% when using an airbag. The risk for passengers is lowered by 82% to 0.797%. The tests with the airbags were done at , faster than the tests without air bags. There is a 15.45% risk of serious injury to unprotected occupants at , this drops to 4.68% with protected occupants. This is a 69.7% decrease in change of serious injury, with the airbags deploying 96.1% of the time.\nImprovements in sensing and gas-generator technology have allowed the development of third-generation airbag systems that can adjust their deployment parameters to the size, weight, position, and restraint status of the occupant. These improvements have demonstrated a reduced injury risk factor for small adults and children, who had an increased risk of injury with first-generation airbag systems.\nOne model of airbags made by the Takata Corporation used ammonium nitrate\u2013based gas-generating compositions in airbag inflators instead of the more stable, but more expensive compound tetrazole. The ammonium nitrate-based inflators have a flaw where old inflators with long-term exposure to hot and humid climate conditions could rupture during deployment, projecting metal shards through the airbag and into the driver. As of December 2022, the defect has caused 33 deaths worldwide, with up to 24 in the U.S. and the remaining in Australia and Malaysia. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recalled over 33 million vehicles in May 2015, and fined Takata $70 million in November 2015. Toyota, Mazda, and Honda have said that they will not use ammonium-nitrate inflators. In June 2017, Takata filed for bankruptcy.\nAirbag fatality statistics.\nFrom 1990 to 2000, the United States NHTSA identified 175 fatalities caused by airbags. Most of these (104) have been children. About 3.3 million airbag deployments have occurred during that interval, and the agency estimates more than 6,377 lives were saved and countless injuries were prevented.\nA rear-facing infant restraint put in the front seat of a vehicle places an infant's head close to the airbag, which can cause severe head injuries or death if the airbag deploys. Some modern cars include a switch to disable the front-passenger airbag, in case a child-supporting seat is used there (although not in Australia, where rear-facing child seats are prohibited in the front where an airbag is fitted).\nIn vehicles with side airbags, it is dangerous for occupants to lean against the windows, doors, and pillars, or to place objects between themselves and the side of the vehicle. Articles hung from a vehicle's clothes hanger hooks can be hazardous if the vehicle's side-curtain airbags are deployed. A seat-mounted airbag may also cause internal injury if the occupant leans against the door.\nAerospace and military applications.\nThe aerospace industry and the United States government have applied airbag technologies for many years. NASA and United States Department of Defense have incorporated airbag systems in various aircraft and spacecraft applications as early as the 1960s.\nSpacecraft airbag landing systems.\nThe first use of airbags for landing were Luna 9 and Luna 13. As with later missions, these would use the airbags to bounce along the surface, absorbing landing energy. The Mars Pathfinder lander employed an innovative airbag landing system, supplemented with aerobraking, parachute, and solid rocket landing thrusters. This prototype successfully tested the concept, and the two Mars Exploration Rover Mission landers employed similar landing systems. The Beagle 2 Mars lander also tried to use airbags for landing; the landing was successful, and the lander touched down safely, but several of the spacecraft's solar panels failed to deploy, thereby disabling the spacecraft.\nThe Boeing Starliner uses six airbags to cushion the ground landing of the crewed capsule.\nAircraft airbag landing systems.\nAirbags have also been used on military fixed-wing aircraft, such as the escape crew capsule of the F-111 Aardvark.\nOccupant protection.\nThe United States Army has incorporated airbags in its UH-60A/L Black Hawk and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter fleets. The Cockpit Air Bag System (CABS) consists of forward and lateral airbags, and an inflatable tubular structure (on the OH-58D only) with an Electronic Crash Sensor Unit (ECSU). The CABS system was developed by the United States Army Aviation Applied Technology Directorate, through a contract with Simula Safety Systems (now BAE Systems). It is the first conventional airbag system for occupant injury prevention (worldwide) designed and developed and placed in service for an aircraft, and the first specifically for helicopter applications.\nOther uses.\nIn the mid-1970s, the UK Transport Research Laboratory tested several types of motorcycle airbags. In 2006 Honda introduced the first production motorcycle airbag safety system on its Gold Wing motorcycle. Honda claims that sensors in the front forks can detect a severe frontal collision and decide when to deploy the airbag, absorbing some of the forward energy of the rider and reducing the velocity at which the rider may be thrown from the motorcycle.\nMore commonly, air bag vests \u2013 either integrated into the motorcyclist's jacket or worn over it \u2013 have started to become used by regular riders on the street. MotoGP has made it compulsory since 2018 for riders to wear suits with integrated airbags.\nSimilarly, companies such as Helite and Hit-Air have commercialized equestrian airbags, which attach to the saddle and are worn by the rider. Other sports, particularly skiing and snowboarding, have started introducing airbag safety mechanisms.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He served as the first and third president of the Republic of Texas and was one of the first two individuals to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He also served as the sixth governor of Tennessee and the seventh governor of Texas. Houston is the only individual to be elected governor of two different US states.\nBorn in Rockbridge County, Virginia, Houston and his family relocated to Maryville, Tennessee, while he was a teenager. Houston later ran away from home, spending about three years living with the Cherokee, becoming known as \"Raven\". He served under General Andrew Jackson in the War of 1812; afterwards, he was appointed as a sub-agent to oversee the removal of the Cherokee from Tennessee into Arkansas Territory in 1818. With the support of Jackson, among others, Houston won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1823. He strongly supported Jackson's presidential candidacies and, in 1827, Houston was elected as the governor of Tennessee. In 1829, after divorcing his first wife, Houston resigned from office, and moved to the Arkansas Territory to live with the Cherokee once more.\nHouston settled in Texas in 1832. After the Battle of Gonzales, he helped organize Texas's provisional government and was selected as the top-ranking official in the Texian Army. He led the Texian Army to victory at the Battle of San Jacinto, the decisive battle in Texas's war for independence against Mexico. After the war, Houston won the 1836 Texan presidential election. He left office due to term limits in 1838, but won another term in the 1841 Texas presidential election. Houston played a key role in the annexation of Texas by the United States in 1845 and, in 1846, was elected to represent Texas in the United States Senate. He joined the Democratic Party and supported President James K. Polk's prosecution of the Mexican\u2013American War.\nHis Senate record was marked by his unionism and opposition to radicals from both the North and South. He voted for the Compromise of 1850, which settled many of the residual territorial issues from the Mexican\u2013American War and the annexation of Texas. Houston owned slaves throughout his life. He voted against the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act of 1854, as he believed it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery, and his opposition to that act led him to later leave the Democratic Party. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the presidential nomination of the American Party in the 1856 presidential election, as well as for the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election. In 1859, Houston won the election for governor of Texas. In this role, he opposed secession, and unsuccessfully sought to keep Texas out of the Confederate States of America. He was forced out of office in 1861, and died two years later in 1863. Houston's name has been honored in numerous ways, and he is the eponym of the city of Houston, the fourth-most-populous city in the United States.\nEarly life.\nSamuel Houston was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia on March 2, 1793, to Samuel Houston and Elizabeth Paxton. Both of Houston's parents were descended from Scottish and Irish colonists who had settled in Colonial America in the 1730s, including his great-grandfather John Houston. Houston's father was descended from Ulster Scots people and the Houston baronets, the founders of Clan Houston in Scotland. Samuel inherited the Timber Ridge plantation and mansion in Rockbridge County, Virginia, which was worked by enslaved African Americans. During the American Revolutionary War, Captain Houston served in Morgan's Rifle Brigade as a paymaster. He served in the Virginian militia, which required him to pay his own expenses and to be away from his family for long periods of time. Thus, the plantation and his family's finances suffered.\nHe had five brothers and three sisters: Paxton, Robert, James (married Patience Bills), John, William (married Mary Ball), Isabella, Mary (married Matthew Wallace), and Eliza (married Samuel Moore).\nHis father, Samuel Sr., planned to sell Timber Ridge and move west to Tennessee, where land was less expensive, but he died in 1806. Elizabeth, his mother, followed through on those plans, settling the family near Maryville, Tennessee, the seat of Blount County. At that time, Tennessee was on the American frontier, and even larger towns like Nashville were vigilant against Native American raids. He had dozens of cousins who lived in the surrounding area of east-central Tennessee. When they arrived, Elizabeth cleared the land, built a house, and planted crops. Her oldest children, Paxton, Isabella, and Robert died within a few years after they arrived in Tennessee. Elizabeth relied on James and John to run the store in Maryville, to operate the farm, and to watch over the younger children.\nHouston had a carefree disposition, however, and liked to escape to explore the frontier. He was at odds with the concepts of hell and damnation preached by his mother's religion, Presbyterianism, and he was not interested in schooling. However, he did take an interest in his father's library, reading works by classical authors like Virgil, as well as more contemporary works by authors such as Jedidiah Morse.\nAfter his father's passing in 1807 and his lack of interest in farming and working in the family store, at the age of 16, he ran away from his family and his home to live with a Cherokee tribe, led by Chief John Jolly (Cherokee name: \"Ahuludegi\", also spelled \"Oolooteka\") on Hiwassee Island. During the time that Sam Houston spent with the Cherrokee Indians, he was taught their language, skills, and customs. This helped Houston develop a special relationship with the Indians, thus gaining their trust. Houston formed a close relationship with Jolly and learned the Cherokee language, becoming known as 'Raven.' According to James L. Haley, he appreciated the \"free and unsophisticated spiritual expression of the Native Americans.\" He left the tribe to return to Maryville in 1812, and he was hired at age 19 for a term as the schoolmaster of a one-room schoolhouse. He attended Porter Academy, where he was taught by Rev. Isaac L. Anderson, founder of Maryville College. It's thought that he attended Maryville College, but that hasn't been confirmed.\nAccording to biographer John Hoyt Williams, Houston was not close with his siblings or his parents, and he rarely spoke of them in his later life. Haley states that he was interested in his younger brother's and his sisters' welfare when he lived on Hiwassee Island. He felt used by the rest of the family.\nHouston had a few women that were prominent in his life. The first being Eliza Allen (ended in scandal and divorce). The second woman in his life was a Cherokee woman named Tiana Rodgers (he lived with her before the divorce for several years). The final woman that is believed to be in his life was his final wife Margaret Moffette Lea. Margaret was the mother of all of his descendants. The age difference between Margaret and Sam Houston was 26 years. Houston was 46 and Maragaret was 20. \nWar of 1812 and aftermath.\nOn March 24, 1813, Houston enlisted in the army at the young age of 20 in the War of 1812 against Britain and Britain's Native American allies. He quickly impressed the commander of the 39th Infantry Regiment, Thomas Hart Benton, and by the end of 1813, Houston had risen to the rank of third lieutenant. In early 1814, the 39th Infantry Regiment became a part of the force commanded by General Andrew Jackson, who was charged with putting an end to raids by a faction of the Muscogee (or \"Creek\") tribe in the Old Southwest. Houston was wounded badly in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, the decisive battle in the Creek War. Although army doctors expected him to die of his wounds, Houston survived and convalesced in Maryville and other locations. While many other officers lost their positions after the end of the War of 1812 due to military cutbacks, Houston retained his commission with the help of Congressman John Rhea. During that time he was promoted to the rank of second lieutenant.\nSometime in early 1817, Sam Houston was assigned to a clerical position in Nashville, serving under the adjutant general for the army's Southern Division. Later in the year, Jackson appointed Houston as a sub-agent to handle the removal of Cherokee from East Tennessee. In February 1818, he received a strong reprimand from the Secretary of War John C. Calhoun after he wore Native American dress to a meeting between Calhoun and Cherokee leaders, beginning an enmity that lasted until Calhoun died in 1850. Angry over the incident with Calhoun and an investigation into his activities, Houston resigned from the army in 1818. He continued to act as a government liaison with the Cherokee, and in 1818, he helped some of the Cherokee resettle in Arkansas Territory.\nEarly political career.\nAfter leaving government service, Houston began an apprenticeship with Judge James Trimble in Nashville. He quickly won admission to the state bar and opened a legal practice in Lebanon, Tennessee. With the aid of Governor Joseph McMinn, Houston won election as the district attorney for Nashville in 1819. He was also appointed as a major general of the Tennessee militia. Like his mentors, Houston was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, which dominated state and national politics in the decade following the War of 1812. Tennessee gained three seats in the United States House of Representatives after the 1820 United States census, and, with the support of Jackson and McMinn, Houston ran unopposed in the 1823 election for Tennessee's 9th congressional district. In his first major speech in Congress, Houston advocated for the recognition of Greece, which was fighting a war of independence against the Ottoman Empire.\nHouston strongly supported Jackson's candidacy in the 1824 presidential election, which saw four major candidates, all from the Democratic-Republican Party, run for president. As no candidate won a majority of the vote, the House of Representatives held a contingent election, which was won by John Quincy Adams. Supporters of Jackson eventually coalesced into the Democratic Party, and those who favored Adams became known as National Republicans. With Jackson's backing, Houston won election as governor of Tennessee in 1827. Governor Houston advocated the construction of internal improvements such as canals, and sought to lower the price of land for homesteaders living in the public domain. He also aided Jackson's successful campaign in the 1828 presidential election.\nIn September 22, 1826, he severely wounded General William A. White in a pistol duel near Franklin, Kentucky, over the patronage political appointment of Nashville's Postmaster.\nIn January 1829, Houston married Eliza Allen, the daughter of wealthy plantation owner John Allen of Gallatin, Tennessee. The marriage quickly fell apart, possibly because Eliza loved another man. In April 1829, following the collapse of his marriage, Houston resigned as governor of Tennessee. Shortly after leaving office, he traveled to Arkansas Territory to rejoin the Cherokee.\nPolitical exile and controversy.\nHouston was reunited with Ahuludegi's group of Cherokee in mid-1829. Because of Houston's government experience and connections with President Jackson, several local Native American tribes asked Houston to mediate disputes and communicate their needs to the Jackson administration. In late 1829, the Cherokee accorded Houston tribal membership and dispatched him to Washington to negotiate several issues. In anticipation of the removal of the remaining Cherokee east of the Mississippi River, Houston unsuccessfully bid to supply rations to the Native Americans during their journey. When Houston returned to Washington in 1832, Congressman William Stanbery alleged that Houston had placed a fraudulent bid in 1830 in collusion with the Jackson administration. On April 13, 1832, after Stanbery refused to answer Houston's letters regarding the incident, Houston beat Stanbery with a cane. After the beating, the House of Representatives brought Houston to trial. By a vote of 106 to 89, the House convicted Houston, and Speaker of the House Andrew Stevenson formally reprimanded Houston. A federal court also required Houston to pay $500 in damages.\nTexas Revolution.\nIn mid-1832, Houston's friends William H. Wharton and John Austin Wharton wrote to convince him to travel to the Mexican possession of Texas, where unrest among the American settlers was growing. The Mexican government had invited Americans to settle the sparsely populated region of Texas, but many of the settlers, including the Whartons, disliked Mexican rule. Houston crossed into Texas in December 1832, and shortly thereafter, he was granted land in Texas. Houston was elected to represent Nacogdoches, Texas at the Convention of 1833, which was called to petition Mexico for statehood (at the time, Texas was part of the state of Coahuila y Tejas). Houston strongly supported statehood, and he chaired a committee that drew a proposed state constitution. After the convention, Texan leader Stephen F. Austin petitioned the Mexican government for statehood, but he was unable to come to an agreement with President Valent\u00edn G\u00f3mez Far\u00edas. In 1834, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna assumed the presidency, took on new powers, and arrested Austin. In October 1835, the Texas Revolution broke out with the Battle of Gonzales, a skirmish between Texan forces and the Mexican Army. Shortly after the battle, Houston was elected to the Consultation, a congregation of Texas leaders.\nAlong with Austin and others, Houston helped organize the Consultation into a provisional government for Texas. In November, Houston joined with most other delegates in voting for a measure that demanded Texas statehood and the restoration of the 1824 Constitution of Mexico. The Consultation appointed Houston as a major general and the highest-ranking officer of the Texian Army, though the appointment did not give him effective control of the militia units that constituted the Texian Army. Houston helped organize the Convention of 1836, where the Republic of Texas declared independence from Mexico, and appointed him as Commander-in-Chief of the Texas Army. Shortly after the declaration, the convention received a plea for assistance from William B. Travis, who commanded Texan forces under siege by Santa Anna at the Alamo. The convention confirmed Houston's command of the Texian Army and dispatched him to lead a relief of Travis's force, but the Alamo fell before Houston could organize his forces at Gonzales, Texas. Seeking to intimidate Texan forces into surrender, the Mexican army killed every defender at the Alamo; news of the defeat outraged many Texans and caused desertions in Houston's ranks. Commanding a force of about 350 men that numerically was inferior to that of Santa Anna, Houston retreated east across the Colorado River.\nThough the provisional government, as well as many of his own subordinates, urged him to attack the Mexican army, Houston continued the retreat east, informing his soldiers that they constituted \"the only army in Texas now present ... There are but a few of us, and if we are beaten, the fate of Texas is sealed.\" Santa Anna divided his forces and finally caught up to Houston in mid-April 1836. Santa Anna's force of about 1,350 soldiers trapped Houston's force of 783 men in a marsh; rather than pressing the attack, Santa Anna ordered his soldiers to make camp. Upon hearing this, the Texian soldiers were wanting to go out and fight. They were tired of retreating and wanted to do something instead of camping there. Even though Houston was hesitant about it, he let them take the reins and decide to attack. On April 21, Houston ordered an attack on the Mexican army, beginning the Battle of San Jacinto. The Texans quickly routed Santa Anna's force, though Houston's horse was shot out under him and his ankle was shattered by a stray bullet. In the aftermath of the Battle of San Jacinto, a detachment of Texans captured Santa Anna. Santa Anna was forced to sign the Treaty of Velasco, which established a ceasefire between the two forces and laid out the first few steps towards Texan independence. Houston stayed briefly for negotiations, then returned to the United States for treatment of his ankle wound.\nPresident of Texas.\nVictory in the Battle of San Jacinto made Houston a hero to many Texans, and he won the 1836 Texas presidential election, defeating Stephen F. Austin, who would receive the honor of having the city of Austin named after him, and Henry Smith. Houston took office on October 22, 1836, after interim president David G. Burnet resigned. During the presidential election, the voters of Texas overwhelmingly indicated their desire for Texas to be annexed by the United States. Houston, meanwhile, faced the challenge of assembling a new government, putting the country's finances in order, and handling relations with Mexico. He selected Mirabeau Lamar as vice president, Thomas Jefferson Rusk as secretary of war, Smith as secretary of the treasury, Samuel Rhoads Fisher as secretary of the navy, James Collinsworth as attorney general, and Austin as secretary of state. Houston sought normalized relations with Mexico, and despite some resistance from the legislature, arranged the release of Santa Anna. Concerned about upsetting the balance between slave states and free states, U.S. President Andrew Jackson refused to push for the annexation of Texas, but in his last official act in office he granted Texas diplomatic recognition. With the United States unwilling to annex Texas, Houston began courting British support; as part of this effort, he urged the end of the importation of slaves into Texas.\nIn early 1837, the government moved to a new capital, the city of Houston, named after him as the country's first president. In 1838, Houston frequently clashed with Congress over issues such as a treaty with the Cherokee and a land-office act and was forced to put down the C\u00f3rdova Rebellion, a plot to allow Mexico to reclaim Texas with aid from the Kickapoo Indians. The Texas constitution barred presidents from seeking a second term, so Houston did not stand for re-election in the 1838 election and left office in late 1838. He was succeeded by Mirabeau B. Lamar, who, along with Burnet, led a faction of Texas politicians opposed to Houston. The Lamar administration removed many of Houston's appointees, launched a , and established a new capital at Austin, Texas. Meanwhile, Houston opened a legal practice and co-founded a land company with the intent of developing the town of Sabine City. In 1839, he was elected to represent San Augustine County in the Texas House of Representatives.\nHouston defeated Burnet in the 1841 Texas presidential election, winning a large majority of the vote. Houston appointed Anson Jones as secretary of state, Asa Brigham as secretary of the treasury, George Washington Hockley as secretary of war, and George Whitfield Terrell as attorney general. The republic faced a difficult financial situation; at one point, Houston commandeered an American brig used to transport Texas soldiers because the government could not afford to pay the brig's captain. The Santa Fe Expedition and other initiatives pursued by Lamar had stirred tensions with Mexico, and rumors frequently raised fears that Santa Anna would launch an invasion of Texas. Houston continued to curry favor with Britain and France, partly in the hope that British and French influence in Texas would encourage the United States to annex Texas. The Tyler administration made the annexation of Texas its chief foreign policy priority, and in April 1844, Texas and the United States signed an annexation treaty. Annexation did not have sufficient support in Congress, and the United States Senate rejected the treaty in June.\nHenry Clay and Martin Van Buren, the respective front-runners for the Whig and Democratic nominations in the 1844 presidential election, both opposed the annexation of Texas. However, Van Buren's opposition to annexation damaged his candidacy, and he was defeated by James K. Polk, an acolyte of Jackson and an old friend of Houston, at the 1844 Democratic National Convention. Polk defeated Clay in the general election, giving backers of annexation an electoral mandate. Meanwhile, Houston's term ended in December 1844, and he was succeeded by Anson Jones, his secretary of state. In the waning days of his own presidency, Tyler used Polk's victory to convince Congress to approve of the annexation of Texas. Seeking Texas's immediate acceptance of annexation, Tyler made Texas a generous offer that allowed the state to retain control of its public lands, though it would be required to keep its public debt. A Texas convention approved of the offer of annexation in July 1845, and Texas officially became the 28th U.S. state on December 29, 1845.\nU.S. Senator.\nMexican\u2013American War and aftermath (1846\u20131853).\nIn February 1846, the Texas legislature elected Houston and Thomas Jefferson Rusk as Texas's two inaugural U.S. senators. Houston chose to align with the Democratic Party, which contained many of his old political allies, including President Polk. As a former president of Texas, Houston is the only former foreign head of state to have served in the U.S. Congress. He was the first person to serve as the governor of a state and then be elected to the U.S. Senate by another state. In 2018, Mitt Romney became the second.\nWilliam W. Bibb accomplished the same feat in reverse order.\nBreaking with the Senate tradition that held that freshman senators were not to address the Senate, Houston strongly advocated in early 1846 for the annexation of Oregon Country. In the Oregon Treaty, reached later in 1846, Britain and the United States agreed to split Oregon Country. Meanwhile, Polk ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead a U.S. army to the Rio Grande, which had been set as the Texas-Mexico border under the Treaty of Velasco; Mexico claimed the Nueces River constituted the true border. After a skirmish between Taylor's unit and the Mexican army, the Mexican\u2013American War broke out in April 1846. Houston initially supported Polk's prosecution of the war, but differences between the two men emerged in 1847. After two years of fighting, the United States defeated Mexico and, through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, acquired the Mexican Cession. Mexico also agreed to recognize the Rio Grande as the border between Mexico and Texas.\nAfter the war, disputes over the extension of slavery into the territories raised sectional tensions. Unlike most of his Southern colleagues, Houston voted for the Oregon Bill of 1848, which organized Oregon Territory as a free territory. Defending his vote to create a territory that excluded slavery, Houston stated \"I would be the last man to wish to do anything injurious to the South, but I do not think that on all occasions we are justified in agitating [slavery].\" He criticized both Northern abolitionists and Democratic followers of Calhoun as extremists who sought to undermine the union. He supported the Compromise of 1850, a sectional compromise on slavery on the territories. Under the compromise, California was admitted as a free state, the slave trade was prohibited in the District of Columbia, a more stringent fugitive slave law was passed, and Utah Territory and New Mexico Territory were established. Texas gave up some of its claims on New Mexico, but it retained El Paso, Texas, and the United States assumed Texas's large public debt. Houston sought the Democratic nomination in the 1852 presidential election, but he was unable to consolidate support outside of his home state. The 1852 Democratic National Convention ultimately nominated Franklin Pierce, a compromise nominee, who went on to win the election.\nPierce and Buchanan administrations (1853\u20131859).\nIn 1854, Senator Stephen A. Douglas led the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, which organized Kansas Territory and Nebraska Territory. The act also repealed the Missouri Compromise, an act that had banned slavery in territories north of parallel 36\u00b030\u2032 north. Houston voted against the act, in part because he believed that Native Americans would lose much of their land as a result of the act. He also perceived that it would lead to increased sectional tensions over slavery. Houston's opposition to the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act led to his departure from the Democratic Party. In 1855, Houston began to be associated publicly with the American Party, the political wing of the nativist and unionist Know Nothing movement. The Whig Party had collapsed after the passage of the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings and the anti-slavery Republican Party had both emerged as major political movements. Houston's affiliation with the party stemmed in part from his fear of the growing influence of Catholic voters; though he opposed barring Catholics from holding office, he wanted to extend the naturalization period for immigrants to 21 years. He was attracted to the Know Nothing's support for a Native American state as well the party's unionist stance.\nHouston sought the presidential nomination at the Know Nothing party's 1856 national convention, but the party nominated former President Millard Fillmore. Houston was disappointed by Fillmore's selection as well as the party platform, which did not rebuke the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act, but he eventually decided to support Fillmore's candidacy. Despite Houston's renewed support, the American Party split over slavery, and Democrat James Buchanan won the 1856 presidential election. The American Party collapsed after the election, and Houston did not affiliate with a national political party for the remainder of his tenure in the senate. In the 1857 Texas gubernatorial election, Texas Democrats nominated Hardin Richard Runnels, who supported the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act and attacked Houston's record. In response, Houston announced his own candidacy for governor, but Runnels defeated him by a decisive margin. It was the only electoral defeat of his career. After the gubernatorial election, the Texas legislature denied Houston re-election in the senate; Houston rejected calls to resign immediately and served until the end of his term in early 1859.\nGovernor of Texas.\nBefore he successfully became the governor of Texas, Houston had run unsuccessfully in 1857. He ran again in 1859, and won. Houston ran against Runnels in the 1859 gubernatorial election. Capitalizing on Runnels's unpopularity over state issues such as Native American raids, Houston won the election and took office in December 1859. In the 1860 presidential election, Houston and John Bell were the two major contenders for the presidential nomination of the newly formed Constitutional Union Party, which consisted largely of Southern unionists. Houston narrowly trailed Bell on the first ballot of the 1860 Constitutional Union Convention, but Bell clinched the nomination on the second ballot. Nonetheless, some of Houston's Texan supporters nominated him for president in April 1860. Other backers attempted to launch a nationwide campaign, but in August 1860, Houston announced that he would not be a candidate for president. He refused to endorse any of the remaining presidential candidates. In late 1860, Houston campaigned across his home state, calling on Texans to resist those who advocated for secession if Republican nominee Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election.\nAfter Lincoln won the November 1860 presidential election, several Southern states seceded from the United States and formed the Confederate States of America. A Texas political convention voted to secede from the United States on February 1, 1861, and after Houston refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy, the legislature declared the governorship vacant. Houston did not recognize the validity of his removal, but he did not attempt to use force to remain in office, and he refused aid from the federal government to prevent his removal. His successor, Edward Clark, was sworn in in March 1861. In an undelivered speech, Houston wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Fellow-Citizens, in the name of your rights and liberties, which I believe have been trampled upon, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of the nationality of Texas, which has been betrayed by the Convention, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of the Constitution of Texas, I refuse to take this oath. In the name of my own conscience and manhood, which this Convention would degrade by dragging me before it, to pander to the malice of my enemies, I refuse to take this oath. I deny the power of this Convention to speak for Texas. ... I protest. ... against all the acts and doings of this convention and I declare them null and void.\nOn April 19, 1861, he told a crowd:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.\nAccording to historian Randolph Campbell:\nHouston did everything possible to prevent secession and war, but his first loyalty was to Texas\u2014and the South. Houston refused offers of troops from the United States to keep Texas in the Union and announced on May 10, 1861 that he would stand with the Confederacy in its war effort.\nRetirement and death.\nAfter leaving office, Houston returned to his home in Galveston. He later settled in Huntsville, Texas, where he lived in a structure known as the Steamboat House. In the midst of the Civil War, Houston was shunned by many Texas leaders, though he continued to correspond with Confederate officer Ashbel Smith and Texas governor Francis Lubbock. His son, Sam Houston Jr., served in the Confederate army during the Civil War, but returned home after being wounded at the Battle of Shiloh. Houston's health suffered a precipitous decline in April 1863, which contributed to his death on July 26, 1863, at 70 years of age. Houston's official cause of death is believed to be from Pneumonia.\nThe inscription on Houston's tomb reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nA Brave Soldier. A Fearless Statesman.\nA Great Orator\u2014A Pure Patriot.\nA Faithful Friend, A Loyal Citizen.\nA Devoted Husband and Father.\nA Consistent Christian\u2014An Honest Man.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nPersonal life.\nIn January 1829 Sam Houston, then Governor of Tennessee, married 19-year-old Eliza Allen. The marriage lasted 11 weeks. Neither Houston nor Eliza ever gave a reason for their separation, but Eliza refused to sanction divorce. Subsequently, he resigned his governorship and went to live with his Cherokee family for three years. In the summer of 1830, Houston married Dianna Rogers (sometimes called Tiana), daughter of Chief John \"Hellfire\" Rogers (1740\u20131833), a Scots-Irish trader, and Jennie Due (1764\u20131806), a sister of Chief John Jolly, in a Cherokee ceremony. The ceremony was modest since it was Dianna's second marriage; she was widowed with two children from her previous marriage: Gabriel, born 1819, and Joanna, born 1822. She and Houston first met when she was ten years old, and he was stunned to see how beautiful she was when he returned to her village years later. The two lived together for several years. Tennessee society disapproved of the marriage because under civil law, he was still legally married to Eliza Allen Houston. After declining to accompany Houston to Texas in 1832, Dianna later remarried. She died in 1838 of pneumonia. Will Rogers was her nephew, three generations removed.\nIn 1837, after becoming President of the Republic of Texas, he was able to acquire, from a district court judge, a divorce from Eliza Allen.\nIn 1839, he purchased a horse which became one of the foundation sires of the American Quarter Horse breed named Copperbottom. He owned the horse until its death in 1860.\nOn May 9, 1840, Houston, aged 47, married for a third time. His bride was 21-year-old Margaret Moffette Lea of Marion, Alabama, the daughter of planters. They had eight children, including Sam Jr., Andrew, and Temple. With Margaret being a woman of Baptist faith, she had influenced him to quit many of the bad habits he had developed, such as drinking and acting out. Although the Houstons had numerous houses, they kept only one continuously: Cedar Point (1840\u20131863) on Trinity Bay.\nIn 1833, Houston was baptized into the Catholic faith in order to qualify under the existing Mexican law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas. The sacrament was held in the living room of the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches, Texas. By 1854, Margaret had spent 14 years trying to convert Houston to the Baptist church. With the assistance of George Washington Baines, she convinced Houston to convert, and he agreed to adult baptism. Spectators from neighboring communities came to Independence, Texas, to witness the event. On November 19, 1854, Houston was baptized by Rev. Rufus C. Burleson, president of Baylor University, by immersion in Little Rocky Creek, two miles southeast of Independence.\nRelationship to slavery and Mexicans.\nHouston was a slaveholder who had a complicated history with the institution of slavery. He was the president of the independent Republic of Texas, which was founded as a slave-holding nation, and governor of Texas after its 1845 annexation to the union as a slave state. He voted various times against the extension of slavery into the Western United States and he did not swear an oath to the Confederate States of America, which marked the end of his political career.\nHouston believed that it was more important to stand by other states and their interests than to divide the United States over slavery. He stated that the country was founded on slavery, but when it did not suit the economic needs of Northern states, those states abolished slavery. He claimed that Northern states benefited from slave labor when they bought cotton and sugar produced from Southern plantations. Although he governed Texas as a slave-holding state and was a slave owner himself, he did not feel that it was in the best interests of Texas to secede from the Union over slavery.\nHouston and his wife Margaret Lea relied on slaves to perform household, agricultural, carpentry, blacksmithing, and other duties for the family. Eliza, who came with Margaret into Houston's family, was critical to running the household and raising the children. She stayed with the daughters of Sam and Margaret until she died in 1898. The multi-skilled Joshua was important to meeting the needs of the family. Houston often hired his slaves out for money and allowed them to keep a portion of the money for themselves. When Houston died, Joshua offered to give money to Margaret to help support her children.\nUntil they were emancipated, Houston's slaves did not control where and how they were employed. There were limits to how they could spend their free time. They had little power to make decisions for themselves and their children.\nThere is a question about whether Houston made a pejorative comment about Mexicans in an 1835 speech to the Texas volunteer army at Refugio. One second hand source makes this claim; however, subsequent research casts doubt on the source and concludes that the disparaging comment is unlikely to have occurred.\nLegacy.\nHouston, the largest city in Texas and the American South, is named in his honor. Several other things and places are named for Houston, including Sam Houston State University; Houston County, Minnesota; Houston County, Tennessee; Houston County, Texas. Other monuments and memorials include Sam Houston National Forest, Sam Houston Regional Library and Research Center, U.S. Army post Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, the USS \"Sam Houston\" (SSBN-609), and a Texas State Highway Beltway 8 is named after Houston with the names Sam Houston Tollway and Sam Houston Parkway. A sculpture of Houston by Enrico Cerracchio is an outdoor bronze sculpture, installed at the northwest corner of Houston's Hermann Park, in Texas.\nA 67-foot-tall statue of Houston, created by sculptor David Adickes in 1994, named \"A Tribute to Courage\" (and colloquially called \"Big Sam\") stands next to I-45, between Dallas and Houston, in Huntsville, Texas. It is the ninth-tallest statue in the United States and was vandalized with graffiti in March 2008. Along with Stephen F. Austin, Houston is one of two Texans with a statue in the National Statuary Hall. Houston has been portrayed in works such as \"Man of Conquest\", \"Gone to Texas\", \"Texas Rising\", and \"The Alamo\". In 1960, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nWorks cited.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nrole=\"presentation\" class=\"wikitable succession-box noprint\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:small;clear:both;\""}

His play-by-play work earned him recognition (or induction in some cases) from numerous halls of fame (Baseball, Pro Football, and Radio). He\u00a0has also been inducted as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum. He was the father of ESPN sportscaster Joe Buck.\nEarly years and military service.\nBuck was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the third of seven children of Earle and Kathleen Buck. His father was a railroad accountant who commuted weekly to New Jersey. From an early age, Buck dreamed of becoming a sports announcer with his early exposure to sports broadcasting coming from listening to Boston Red Sox baseball games announced by Fred Hoey.\nPart of his childhood coincided with the Great Depression, and Buck remembered his family sometimes using a metal slug to keep a coin-operated gas meter going during the winter to provide heat for their home. In 1939, his family moved to Cleveland, Ohio to join their father, who had a job with the Erie Railroad. Soon after though, Buck's father died at the age of 49 due to uremic poisoning related to high blood pressure.\nBuck planned to quit high school in 1941 to take a full-time job in an effort to support his family. Dissuaded by one of his teachers, Buck decided to finish high school, graduating from Lakewood High School in the winter of 1942. After graduation, he followed one of his friends and began working on an iron ore freight boat operated on the Great Lakes by the Cleveland Cliffs Iron Company.\nBuck served on a steamer named \"The Sheadle\", where he began as porter and was later promoted to night cook and baker. After performing various other shipping related jobs, Buck attempted to become a \"deck watch.\" A required physical examination revealed Buck was color blind, unable to differentiate between the colors green and brown. Ineligible for the promotion to deck watch, Buck subsequently became eligible for the military draft, and was drafted into the United States Army in June\u00a01943.\nAfter completion of his military service in 1946, Buck enrolled at (and graduated from) Ohio State University. His early sportscasting career included work for the minor league affiliates of the St. Louis Cardinals. In 1954, he was promoted to radio play-by-play of Cardinal games on KXOK radio; the team's radio broadcasts would move in 1955 to KMOX. Buck maintained this position for nearly all of the next 47 years. He was known in St. Louis for his trademark phrase \"That's a winner!\", which was said after every game that the Cardinals had won.\nIn addition to his work with the Cardinals, Buck also earned assignments on many national sportscasts, including radio coverage of 18 Super Bowls and 11 World Series. Some of his famous play-by-play calls include the dramatic walk-off home runs hit by Ozzie Smith in Game 5 of the 1985 National League Championship Series, by Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, and by Kirby Puckett in Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.\nThe later part of his career found him working side by side in the Cardinals booth with his son Joe Buck, who also has risen to national sportscasting prominence.\nMilitary service.\nAfter graduating from high school, he worked on large shipping boats that traveled the Great Lakes. Buck was drafted into the U.S.\u00a0Army in June\u00a01943. The physicality of Buck's work on the Great Lakes left in him good physical condition at the time he entered the Army. Buck, who was 19 years old, stood tall, and weighed . His first assignment was anti-aircraft training, and was sent to Fort Eustis, Virginia to undergo his 13-week basic training regimen.\nAfter completing his basic training in 1943, Buck was designated as an instructor, and assigned the rank of corporal. In addition to his instructor duties, Buck participated in boxing as a form of recreation. In February 1945, Buck shipped out to the European theater of the war, where he was assigned to K Company, 47th Infantry Regiment, 9th Infantry Division.\nDuring the night of March 7, 1945, Buck and his compatriots crossed the Ludendorff Bridge at the town of Remagen, Germany. United States forces' successful capture of this bridge led to the Battle of Remagen from March 7\u201325. On the morning of March 15, Buck was the squad leader of a patrol that came under German fire in the Remagen zone. Wounded in his left forearm and leg by fragmentation, Buck received medical treatment on the battlefield from the only medic K company had at that time, Frank Borghi. He received further medical treatment at the 177th General Army Hospital in Le Mans, France, where he was awarded the Purple Heart. Buck recovered, and rejoined his outfit sometime after German forces had surrendered.\nDeclining to re-enlist, and turning down requests to enroll in the Officers Training School, Buck joined his compatriots in guard duty of German prisoners of war. Buck received orders to ship home in April\u00a01946, effectively ending his military service.\nCollege.\nAfter returning to the United States, Buck worked in various industrial-related jobs. When his friend Bill Theil told Buck he needed a roommate to attend Ohio State University with him, Buck decided on the spot to join Theil and enroll at Ohio State in Columbus. The suddenness of Buck's decision meant he had no corresponding paperwork that could be used to formally enroll at the university, so Buck attended classes of his own choosing until he was able to formally enroll.\nBuck majored in radio speech and minored in Spanish. He worked several jobs while attending college, including one position at an all-night gas station. He\u00a0crafted his play-by-play skills broadcasting Ohio State basketball games.\nAfter college, he called games for the Columbus Red Birds, a Triple-A (American Association) affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals, in 1950\u201351. He spent the 1953 season as voice of another AAA Cardinals affiliate, the International League Rochester Red Wings on WHEC radio. His work there earned him an invitation to join the big-league Cardinals' broadcast team in St. Louis the following season.\nBroadcasting career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nBuck started broadcasting Cardinals games for KMOX radio in 1954, teaming with Harry Caray, Milo Hamilton (1954), and Joe Garagiola (from 1955). Buck was dropped from the Cardinals booth in 1959 to make room for Buddy Blattner; the following year, he called Saturday \"Game of the Week\" telecasts for ABC. Buck was re-hired by the Cardinals in 1961 after Blattner departed; Garagiola left after 1962, leaving Caray and Buck as the team's broadcast voices from 1963 through 1969.\nAfter Caray was fired by the Cardinals following the 1969 season, Buck ascended to the team's lead play-by-play role (1969 was also the year that Jack Buck divorced his first wife Alyce Larson\u2014whom he had married in 1948 and had six children with\u2014and married his second wife, Carole Lintzenich, who gave birth to their son Joe Buck in the same year).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSmith corks one into right, down the line! It may go!! ... Go crazy, folks! Go crazy! It's a home run, and the Cardinals have won the game, by the score of 3 to 2, on a home run by the Wizard! Go crazy!\n \u2014Jack Buck calling Ozzie Smith's game winning home run off Tom Niedenfuer in game 5 of the 1985 NLCS\nBuck teamed with ex-Yankees and Pirates announcer Jim Woods in 1970\u201371. In 1972, retired Cardinals third baseman Mike Shannon joined Buck in the broadcast booth, beginning a 28-year partnership. On Cardinals broadcasts, Buck routinely punctuated St. Louis victories with the expression, \"That's a winner!\" \nIn addition to Joe, Buck has three daughters who worked in broadcasting. Two are from his first marriage - Bonnie Buck, who currently works in television in Los Angeles, and Christine Buck, who started her career at KPLR-TV in St. Louis. From his second marriage is Julie Buck on KYKY 98.1 in St. Louis (she now works at KTRS-AM 550, also in St. Louis). In addition, Buck's younger brother, Bob Buck was a sportscaster and sports director at KMOX/KMOV-TV in St. Louis.\nBuck was well-respected in the St. Louis community, where he lived and regularly volunteered time to host charity events. In addition to his sportscasting work, Buck served as the original host of the KMOX interview/call-in program \"At Your Service\" beginning in 1960. His guests on the program included Eleanor Roosevelt.\nBuck can be heard calling a (fictional) 1964 Cardinals broadcast in the 1988 film \"Mississippi Burning\", and makes a cameo appearance in a 1998 episode of the television series \"Arliss\". He also lent his voice to \"R.B.I. Baseball '95\" and Relief Pitcher (video game).\nFootball.\nJack Buck was also a renowned football broadcaster. In 1964, he began calling National Football League games for CBS television, following a four-year stint doing telecasts of the rival American Football League for ABC, which included the 1962 AFL Championship game between the Houston Oilers and the Dallas Texans\u2014at that point the longest game ever played. Buck called Chicago Bears games in his first two CBS seasons, then switched to Dallas Cowboys games, including the famous \"Ice Bowl\" championship game in 1967. After the network moved away from dedicated team announcers, Buck continued to call regional NFL action through 1974, as well as several NFC Championship Games and Super Bowl IV. He also called the 1965 Cotton Bowl Classic for CBS television and several later Cotton Bowl games for CBS Radio.\nIn 1975, Buck temporarily left his Cardinals baseball duties in order to host the NBC pregame show, \"GrandStand\", alongside Bryant Gumbel. In the 1976 and 1977 seasons, he called regional NFL play-by-play for NBC. On August 16, 1976, Buck called the first-ever NFL game played outside of the United States, a preseason exhibition between the St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Chargers held at Korakuen Stadium in Tokyo, Japan. (Buck also worked NBC's backup \"Game of the Week\" during the 1976 baseball season before returning to the Cardinals full-time in 1977.)\nBuck served as the CBS Radio voice of \"Monday Night Football\" (teaming with Hank Stram) for nearly two decades (1978\u20131984 and again from 1987\u20131995 after CBS regained the radio rights from NBC). Ironically, in 1970 ABC's Roone Arledge had asked via telephone about Buck's interests in becoming the first television play-by-play announcer for \"Monday Night Football\", but because of personal animosity surrounding his previous stint with the network, Buck would not return their phone call. (The television play-by-play role would go to Keith Jackson instead, and later to Buck's CBS colleague, Frank Gifford.)\nIn addition to \"MNF\", Buck called numerous playoff games for CBS Radio, including 17 Super Bowls (the most of any announcer). Buck also served as a local radio broadcaster for the football Cardinals in 1980 and 1981, and returned to calling Sunday NFL games for CBS television from 1982 to 1987.\nLate in the 1990 NFL season, Buck's onetime CBS broadcasting partner, Pat Summerall, was hospitalized with a bleeding ulcer after vomiting on a plane during a flight after a game, and was out for a considerable amount of time. While Verne Lundquist replaced Summerall on games with lead analyst John Madden, Buck (who was at the time the network's lead Major League Baseball announcer) filled in for Lundquist, teaming with Dan Fouts to call two games (both of which coincidentally featured the Cardinals, who had moved from St. Louis to Arizona by that time).\nOther sports.\nWhile much better known for his baseball and football commentary, Jack Buck was also the original voice of the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League. Buck was paired with Jay Randolph and Gus Kyle on Blues broadcasts and covered the 1968 Stanley Cup Finals for KMOX radio.\nHe was succeeded after one season by broadcaster Dan Kelly. Buck also broadcast for the St. Louis Hawks and Rochester Royals of the National Basketball Association, and called professional wrestling, boxing, and bowling at various times in his career.\nShowing his versatility, Buck also hosted the syndicated Top Star Bowling during the early 1960s.\nABC and CBS baseball.\nIn 1960, Buck along with Carl Erskine broadcast a series of late-afternoon Saturday games on ABC. They were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season.\nDespite temporarily losing the \"Game of the Week\" package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60.\nFor a number of years Buck called baseball events nationally for the CBS Radio network, teaming with Brent Musburger to call the All-Star Game in 1976 and with Jerry Coleman to call the NLCS from 1979\u20131982. From 1983\u20131989, Buck variously teamed with Sparky Anderson, Bill White, and Johnny Bench to call World Series radio broadcasts on CBS Radio, including appearances by the Cardinals in 1985 and 1987. (As a Cardinals announcer, Buck had previously called the World Series in 1968 (on NBC Radio) and 1982 (locally on KMOX).) Buck, along with his CBS Radio colleagues Johnny Bench and John Rooney, was on hand at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on October 17, 1989, when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit. After the 6.9 magnitude quake rocked the Bay Area, Buck told the listening audience:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I must say about Johnny Bench, folks, if he moved that fast when he played, he would have never hit into a double play. I never saw anybody move that fast in my life.\nHe is most famous for his coast-to-coast radio call of Kirk Gibson's game-winning home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series and his disbelief at Gibson knocking it out while hobbled by injuries to his right hamstring and left knee. His call of the play is so famous that it is sometimes played over the television footage of the play. The television call was handled by long-time Dodgers announcer Vin Scully on NBC.\nThis was Buck's call. It begins here with Buck speculating on what might happen if Gibson manages to reach base:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... then you would run for Gibson and have Sax batting. But, we have a big 3\u20132 pitch coming here from Eckersley. Gibson \"swings\", and a fly ball to deep right field! \"This is gonna be a home run!\" Unbelievable! A home run for Gibson! And the Dodgers have won the game, five to four; I don't believe what I just saw!\nThe last sentence is often remembered and quoted by fans. Buck followed it with,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I don't \"believe\" what I just saw! Is this really happening, Bill?\nBuck concluded his comments on Gibson's amazing feat with this thought:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;One of the most remarkable finishes to any World Series Game ... a one-handed home run by Kirk Gibson! And the Dodgers have won it ... five to four; and I'm stunned, Bill. I have seen a lot of dramatic finishes in a lot of sports, but this one might top almost every other one.\nBuck was not intended to be the main play-by-play announcer for CBS baseball telecasts when the network acquired the sport from NBC and ABC. Originally assigned to the network's #2 crew (and therefore, work with Jim Kaat), he was promoted at practically the last minute after Brent Musburger was fired on April Fools' Day of 1990.\nAfter two years of calling baseball telecasts (including the Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\", All-Star Game, National League Championship Series, and World Series), Buck was dismissed by CBS. The official reasoning behind Buck's ouster was that he simply had poor chemistry with lead analyst Tim McCarver.\nBuck was soon replaced by Boston Red Sox announcer Sean McDonough. Buck later noted that \"CBS never got that baseball play-by-play draws word-pictures. All they knew was that football stars analysts. So they said, 'Let McCarver run the show ... In television, all they want you to do is shut up. I'm not very good at shutting up.\" Buck was criticized by some for his alleged habit of predicting plays on air.\nBuck made controversial statements about singer Bobby Vinton prior to Game 4 of the 1990 National League Championship Series. After Vinton muffed the lyrics of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" in his home town of Pittsburgh, Buck lightly referenced Vinton's Polish heritage (\"Well, when you're Polish &amp; live in Pittsburgh, you can do anything you want with the words!\"). Buck soon got death threats from Pittsburgh Pirates fans, who even went as far as leaving a footprint on Buck's hotel pillow. The next day, CBS Sports executive producer Ted Shaker spotted Buck in the hotel lobby and told Buck that he was in trouble.\nThe final baseball play that Jack Buck narrated for CBS television was Gene Larkin's game winning bloop single in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The Twins are going to win the World Series! The Twins have won it! It's a base hit! It's a 1\u20130 10th inning victory!\nFinal years.\nOver the course of the 1990s, Buck decided to reduce his schedule to calling only Cardinals home games (or 81 games a year unless there was a special occurrence). Health concerns played a factor in this, as Buck suffered from such ailments as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, requiring a pacemaker, cataracts, sciatica, and vertigo. Buck once joked, \"I wish I'd get Alzheimer's, then I could forget I've got all the other stuff.\" In 1998, the Cardinals dedicated a bust of Buck that showed him smiling with a hand cupping his left ear. In 1999, he lent his name to a restaurant venture called J. Buck's, with the restaurant's name being shared with son Joe and daughter Julie.\nIn the final years of his life, Buck became recognized for writing poetry, culminating in national attention for his poem \"For America\", written after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. One of Buck's final public appearances was on September 17, 2001, at Busch Memorial Stadium in St. Louis. It was the first night that Major League Baseball resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11. Sick with lung cancer and also showing the signs of Parkinson's disease, Buck looked frail and struggled to maintain his composure. He concluded by silencing critics who thought baseball had come back too soon: \"I don't know about you, but as for me, the question has already been answered: Should we be here? Yes!\"\nDeath.\nJack Buck died on June 18, 2002, in St. Louis's Barnes-Jewish Hospital from a combination of illnesses. He had stayed in the hospital since January 3 of that year to undergo treatment for lung cancer, Parkinson's disease, and to correct an intestinal blockage.\nWithin two hours of his death, fans were leaving flowers at the base of his bust outside Busch Stadium even though it was the middle of the night. The flags at St. Louis City Hall and the St. Louis County Government Center were lowered to half-staff, the local television news anchors all wore black suits for the next several days, and a public visitation was held in the stadium before the next baseball game after his death, with free admission to the game for all the mourners who filed past his coffin.\nBuck was interred at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in south St. Louis County. His spot on the KMOX Cardinals broadcasts was subsequently filled by former Colorado Rockies announcer Wayne Hagin beginning in 2003. Hagin (who went on to the New York Mets after his stint in St. Louis) moved over to television for the 2006 season, and his spot was filled by one of Buck's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, former Chicago White Sox announcer John Rooney. Rooney and Hagin had worked together on radio for the White Sox in the late 1980's and 1990's.\nBuck's youngest son, Joe, read the eulogy at his father's church funeral. Jack Buck was married twice and had eight children in all; five daughters and three sons. Joe Buck was the lead play-by-play announcer for both Major League Baseball and the NFL on the Fox network. Joe Buck has also done occasional local telecasts for the Cardinals as well as commercials for a local automobile dealership. Jack and Joe Buck are also the only father and son to call play-by-play of Super Bowl telecasts. The pair bookended a 50-year championship drought for the Kansas City Chiefs; Jack having called Super Bowl IV (the Chiefs first SB victory), and Joe announcing the team's victory in Super Bowl LIV.\nDuring postseason telecasts, Joe has often paid homage to his father by signing off with \"We'll see you tomorrow night!\". When the Cardinals won the 2006 World Series, Joe quoted his father again saying, \"For the first time since 1982, St. Louis has a World Series winner!\", referencing Jack's line when the Cards won in 1982, \"And that's a winner! That's a winner! A World Series winner for the Cardinals!\". During the 2011 Series, Joe punctuated David Freese's 11th inning walk-off homer for the Cardinals in Game 6 with \"We will see you ... tomorrow night!\", near similar to the 1991 Puckett home run description, a call he said he did to celebrate his father. When the Cardinals won Game 7, he did not quote his father.\nAwards and recognition.\nBuck received the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting from the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1987, and the Pete Rozelle Radio-Television Award from the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1996.\nThe Missouri Sports Hall of Fame inducted Buck twice, as a media personality (1980) and Missouri sports legend (2000). The National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association named Buck as Missouri Sportscaster of the Year 22 times, and inducted him into its Hall of Fame in 1990. Buck was also inducted into the American Sportscasters Association Hall of Fame in 1990, the Missouri Athletic Club Hall of Fame in 1993, the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1995, and the NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame in 2005. The American Sportscasters Association ranked Buck 11th in its listing of the Top 50 Sportscasters of All Time in 2009.\nBuck is honored with a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\nA bronze statue of him was erected at the entrance to Busch Memorial Stadium in 1998 (and moved to a new location outside the current Busch Stadium in 2007).\nA section of I-64/US-40 in St. Louis is named the Jack Buck Memorial Highway in his honor.\nIn January, 2014, the Cardinals announced Buck among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014.\nThe Jack Buck Award, presented by the Missouri Athletic Club \"in recognition of the enthusiastic and dedicated support of sports in St. Louis\", is named in his honor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was fought between 7 August 1942 and 9 February 1943, and involved major land and naval battles on and surrounding the island of Guadalcanal. It was the first major Allied land offensive against Japan during the war.\nIn summer 1942, the Allies decided to mount major offensives in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands with the objectives of defending sea lines to Australia and eventually attacking the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. The Guadalcanal operation was under the command of Robert L. Ghormley, reporting to Chester W. Nimitz, while the Japanese defense consisted of the Combined Fleet under Isoroku Yamamoto and the Seventeenth Army under Harukishi Hyakutake.\nOn 7 August 1942, Allied forces, predominantly U.S. Marines, landed on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida Island in the southern Solomon Islands. The Japanese defenders, who had occupied the islands since May 1942, offered little initial resistance, but the capture of Guadalcanal soon turned into a lengthy campaign as both sides added reinforcements. The Allies captured and completed Henderson Field on Guadalcanal and established a defense perimeter. The Japanese made several attempts to retake the airfield, including in mid-September and in late October. The campaign also involved major naval battles, including the Battles of Savo Island, the Eastern Solomons, Cape Esperance, and the Santa Cruz Islands, culminating in a decisive Allied victory at the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in mid-November. Further engagements took place at the Battle of Tassafaronga and Battle of Rennell Island. In December, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal to focus on the defense of the other Solomon Islands, and evacuated their last forces by 9 February 1943. \nThe campaign followed the successful Allied defensive actions at the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway in May and June 1942. Along with the battles at Milne Bay and Buna\u2013Gona on New Guinea, the Guadalcanal campaign marked the Allies' transition from defensive operations to offensive ones, and effectively allowed them to seize the strategic initiative in the Pacific theater from the Japanese. The campaign was followed by other major Allied offensives in the Pacific, most notably: the Solomon Islands campaign, New Guinea campaign, the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign of 1944 to 1945, and the Volcano and Ryukyu Islands campaign prior to the surrender of Japan in August 1945.\nBackground.\nStrategic considerations.\nOn 7 December 1941, Japanese forces attacked the United States Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack killed almost 2,500 people and crippled much of the U.S. battleship fleet, precipitating formal declarations of war between the two nations the next day. The initial goals of the Japanese leadership were to neutralize the U.S. Navy, seize territories rich in natural resources, and establish strategic military bases with which to defend Japan's empire in the Pacific Ocean and Asia. Initially, Japanese forces captured the Philippines, Thailand, Malaya, Singapore, Burma, the Dutch East Indies, Wake Island, Gilbert Islands, New Britain and Guam. The U.S. was joined in the war against Japan by several of the Allied powers, including the British Empire and the Dutch government-in-exile, both of which had also been attacked by Japan.\nThe Japanese made two attempts to continue their offensive and extend their outer defensive perimeter in the south and central Pacific to a point at which they could threaten Australia, Hawaii, and the U.S. west coast. The first offensive was thwarted in the naval Battle of the Coral Sea, which was a tactical stalemate but a strategic Allied victory in retrospect. It was the Allies' first major victory against the Japanese and significantly reduced the offensive capability of Japan's carrier forces. However, the battle did not temper Japan's audacious offensive military posture for several crucial months, with Japanese forces attempting a failed attack on Port Moresby over the Kokoda track. The second major Japanese offensive was stopped at the Battle of Midway. Both sides suffered significant losses in carrier aircraft and aircrew during these engagements. Crucially, while the Americans were able to reconstitute their naval air strength in relatively short order, the Japanese ultimately proved unable to do so. These strategic victories allowed the Allies to transition to a more offensive stance in the Pacific theater, and attempt to seize the strategic initiative from Japan.\nThe Allies chose the Solomon Islands (a protectorate of the United Kingdom), specifically the southern islands of Guadalcanal, Tulagi and Florida Island, as their first target, designated Task One (codename \"Pestilence\"), with the initial objectives of occupying the Santa Cruz Islands (codename \"Huddle\"), Tulagi (codename \"Watchtower\"), and \"adjacent positions\". Guadalcanal (codename \"Cactus\"), which eventually became the focus of the operation, was not even mentioned in the early directive, and only later took on the operation name \"Watchtower\". Tulagi, although small, had a large natural harbor that was ideal for a float-plane base; Florida Island also had to be taken, as it dominated Tulagi. Guadalcanal, much larger than the other two islands and located to the south across the soon-to-be-named Ironbottom Sound, was added when it was discovered the Japanese were constructing an airbase there.\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had occupied Tulagi in May 1942 and had constructed a seaplane base nearby. Allied concern grew when, in early July, the IJN began constructing a large airfield at Lunga Point on nearby Guadalcanal. From such a base, Japanese long-range bombers could threaten the sea lines of communication and maritime trade &amp; transportation routes from the west coast of the Americas to the populous east coast of Australia. By August, the Japanese had about 900 naval troops on Tulagi and nearby islands, and 2,800 personnel (including 2,200 Korean forced laborers and trustees, as well as Japanese construction specialists) on Guadalcanal. These bases were meant to protect Japan's major naval base at Rabaul, threaten Allied supply and communication lines, and establish a staging area for a planned offensive against Fiji, New Caledonia and Samoa (\"Operation FS\"). The Japanese planned to deploy 45 fighters and 60 bombers to Guadalcanal. In the overall strategy for 1942, these aircraft would provide ground-based air cover for Japanese naval forces advancing farther into the South Pacific.\nThe Allied plan to invade the southern Solomons was conceived by U.S. Admiral Ernest King, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet. He proposed the offensive in order to deny the use of the islands to the Japanese as bases from which the supply routes between the United States and Australia could be threatened, and to use them as starting points for further Allied offensives in the South Pacific. With U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's tacit consent, King also advocated for an invasion of Guadalcanal. Due to the Roosevelt administration's support for Great Britain's proposal that priority be given to defeating Germany before Japan, Allied commanders in Pacific theater had to compete for personnel and resources with the European theater.\nAn early obstacle was the desire of both the U.S. Army and the Roosevelt administration to initiate offensive action in Europe prior to a large-scale operation in the Pacific. In addition, it was initially unclear who would command the campaign: Tulagi lay in the area under the command of General Douglas MacArthur, whereas the Santa Cruz Islands lay in Admiral Chester W. Nimitz's Pacific Ocean Area, which would also supply almost all Allied offensive forces that would be staged, supplied and covered from that area. Both problems were overcome, and the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, General George C. Marshall, gave the operation his full support, despite MacArthur's command being unable to directly assist in the operation and the U.S. Navy taking full operational responsibility. As a result, and in order to preserve the unity of command, the boundary between MacArthur's South West Pacific Area and Nimitz's Pacific Ocean Area was shifted to to the west, effective from 1 August 1942.\nChief of Staff to the Commander in Chief William D. Leahy established two goals for 1942\u20131943: first, that Guadalcanal would be taken, in conjunction with an Allied offensive in New Guinea under MacArthur; and second, that the Admiralty Islands and Bismarck Archipelago, including the major Japanese base at Rabaul, would be captured as well. The directive held that the eventual goal was the American reconquest of the Philippines, from which American forces had been evicted in early 1942. The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff created the South Pacific theater, with Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley taking command on 19 June, to direct the offensive in the Solomons. Nimitz, based at Pearl Harbor, was designated as overall Allied commander-in-chief for Allied forces in the Pacific.\nTask force.\nIn preparation for the offensive in the Pacific in May 1942, U.S. Marine Major General Alexander Vandegrift was ordered to move his 1st Marine Division from the United States to New Zealand. Other Allied land, naval and air units were sent to establish or reinforce bases in Fiji, Samoa, New Hebrides and New Caledonia.\nThe island of Espiritu Santo, in the New Hebrides, was selected as the headquarters and primary staging ground for the offensive, codenamed \"Operation Watchtower\", with the commencement date set for 7 August. At first, only the seizure of Tulagi and the Santa Cruz Islands was planned, omitting a landing on Guadalcanal. After Allied reconnaissance discovered Japanese airfield construction efforts on Guadalcanal, its capture was added to the plan, and planned landings on the Santa Cruz islands were (eventually) abandoned. The Japanese were aware, via signals intelligence, of the large-scale movement of Allied forces in the South Pacific Area, but concluded that the Allies were reinforcing either Australia or Port Moresby on the southern coast of New Guinea.\nThe \"Watchtower\" force, numbering 75 warships and transports (including vessels from the U.S. and Australia), assembled near Fiji on 26 July and conducted a single rehearsal landing prior to leaving for Guadalcanal on 31 July. The commander of the Allied expeditionary force was U.S. Vice Admiral Frank Fletcher, Commander of Task Force 16 (whose flag was on the aircraft carrier ). Commanding the amphibious forces was U.S. Rear Admiral Richmond K. Turner. Vandegrift led the 16,000 Allied (primarily U.S. Marine) infantry earmarked for the amphibious landings. The troops sent to Guadalcanal were fresh from military training, armed with legacy bolt-action M1903 Springfield rifles and a meager 10-day supply of ammunition. Because of the need to get the troops into battle quickly, the Allied planners had reduced their supplies from 90 days to only 60. The men of the 1st Marine Division began referring to the coming battle as \"Operation Shoestring\".\nEvents.\nLandings.\nBad weather allowed the Allied expeditionary force to arrive unseen by the Japanese on the night of 6 August and morning of 7 August, taking the defenders by surprise. This is occasionally referred to the \"Midnight Raid on Guadalcanal\". A Japanese patrol aircraft from Tulagi had searched the general area that the Allied invasion fleet was moving through, but was unable to spot the Allied fleet due to severe storms and heavy clouds. The landing force split into two groups, with one group assaulting Guadalcanal and the other Tulagi, Florida, and other nearby islands. Allied warships bombarded the invasion beaches, while U.S. carrier aircraft bombed Japanese positions on the target islands and destroyed 15 Japanese seaplanes at their base near Tulagi.\nTulagi and two nearby small islands, Gavutu and Tanambogo, were assaulted by 3,000 U.S. Marines under the command of Brigadier General William Rupertus. The 886 IJN personnel manning the naval and seaplane bases on the three islands fiercely resisted the Marine landings. With some difficulty, the Marines secured all three islands: Tulagi on 8 August, and Gavutu and Tanambogo by 9 August. The Japanese defenders were killed almost to the last man, and the Marines suffered 248 casualties.\nIn contrast to Tulagi, Gavutu, and Tanambogo, the landings on Guadalcanal encountered much less resistance. At 09:10 on 7 August, Vandegrift and 11,000 U.S. Marines came ashore on Guadalcanal between Koli Point and Lunga Point. Advancing towards Lunga Point, they encountered scant Japanese resistance and secured the airfield by 16:00 on 8 August. The Japanese naval construction units and combat troops, under the command of Captain Kanae Monzen, had panicked after coming under naval bombardment and aerial bombing, and had abandoned the airfield and fled about west to the Matanikau River and Point Cruz area. Japanese troops left behind food, supplies, intact construction equipment and vehicles, and 13 dead at the airfield and surrounding area.\nDuring the landing operations on 7 and 8 August, Rabaul-based Japanese naval aircraft under the command of Yamada Sadayoshi attacked the Allied amphibious forces several times, setting on fire the transport , which sank two days later, and heavily damaging the destroyer . Over the course of two days of air attacks, Japanese air units lost 36 aircraft, while the U.S. lost 19 (including 14 carrier aircraft), both in combat and to accidents.\nAfter these aerial clashes, Fletcher became concerned about the unexpectedly high losses to his carrier fighter aircraft strength, anxious about the threat to his carriers from further Japanese air attacks, and worried about his ships' remaining fuel supply. Fletcher withdrew from the Solomon Islands area with his carrier task force on the evening of 8 August. In response to the loss of carrier-based air cover, Turner decided to withdraw his ships from Guadalcanal, even though less than half of the supplies and heavy equipment needed by the troops ashore had been unloaded. Turner planned to unload as many supplies as possible on Guadalcanal and Tulagi throughout the night of 8 August, and then depart with his ships early on 9 August.\nBattle of Savo Island.\nAs the transports continued to unload on the night of 8\u20139 August, two groups of screening Allied cruisers and destroyers, under the command of British Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, were surprised and defeated by a Japanese force of seven cruisers and one destroyer from the 8th Fleet based at Rabaul and Kavieng, commanded by Japanese Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa. The 8th fleet had been sighted at least five times over the course of the previous days, both by Allied submarines and aerial reconnaissance, but a combination of misidentification of ships and the Allied leadership's dismissal of Japanese night fighting capability contributed to an air of complacence and ignorance among the Allied surface fleet that proved disastrous. Japanese submarine activity and air attack continued to be the main source of concern to Turner and his staff, not the threat of Japanese surface action. \nAs a result, during the Battle of Savo Island on the night of 9 August, Mikawa's force was able to surprise and sink one Australian and three American cruisers, as well as damage another American cruiser and two destroyers. The Japanese suffered only moderate damage to one cruiser. Despite this success, Mikawa was unaware that Fletcher was preparing to withdraw with the U.S. aircraft carriers, and immediately retired to Rabaul without attempting to attack the (now defenseless) Allied transports, fearing daytime air attacks on his vessels once the cover of darkness had been lost. Bereft of his carrier air cover and concerned about Japanese submarine and surface attacks against his degraded fleet, Turner withdrew his badly mauled naval forces from the area on the evening of 9 August. This left the Marines ashore understrength (as some transports in the Allied fleet had retreated without disembarking all of their troops), and without much of their heavy equipment and provisions. Mikawa's decision not to attempt to destroy the Allied transport ships when he had the opportunity proved to be a crucial strategic mistake.\nInitial ground operations.\nThe 11,000 Marines on Guadalcanal initially concentrated on forming a loose defensive perimeter centered around Lunga Point and the airfield, moving what supplies had been brought ashore within the perimeter, and completing the construction of the airfield. Over four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beaches to dispersed dumps within the defensive perimeter. Work began on the airfield immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On 12 August the airfield was named Henderson Field after Lofton R. Henderson, a Marine aviator who was killed during the Battle of Midway. By 18 August the airfield was ready for operation. Five days' worth of food had been landed from the transports, which, along with captured Japanese provisions, gave the Marines a total of 14 days' supply of food. To conserve supplies, the troops were limited to two meals per day.\nAllied troops suffered from a severe strain of dysentery soon after the landings, with one in five Marines afflicted by mid-August. Although some of the Korean construction workers surrendered to the Marines, most of the remaining Japanese and Korean personnel gathered just west of the Lunga perimeter on the west bank of the Matanikau River and subsisted mainly on coconuts. A Japanese naval outpost was also located at Taivu Point, about 35\u00a0kilometers (22\u00a0mi) east of the Lunga perimeter. On 8 August, a Japanese destroyer from Rabaul delivered 113 naval reinforcement troops to the Matanikau position.\nGoettge patrol.\nOn the evening of 12 August, a 25-man U.S. Marine patrol, led by Division D-2 Lieutenant Colonel Frank Goettge and primarily consisting of intelligence personnel, landed by boat west of the U.S. Marine Lunga perimeter, east of Point Cruz and west of the Japanese perimeter at Matanikau River, on a reconnaissance mission with a secondary objective of contacting a group of Japanese troops that U.S. forces believed might be willing to surrender. Soon after the patrol landed, a nearby platoon of Japanese naval troops attacked it and almost completely wiped it out.\nIn response, on 19 August, Vandegrift sent three companies of the U.S. 5th Marine Regiment to attack the Japanese troop concentration west of the Matanikau. One company attacked across the sandbar at the mouth of the Matanikau River while another crossed the river inland and attacked the Japanese forces located in Matanikau village. The third landed by boat further west and attacked Kokumbuna village. After briefly occupying the two villages, the three Marine companies returned to the Lunga perimeter, having killed about 65 Japanese soldiers while losing four Marines. This action, sometimes referred to as the \"First Battle of the Matanikau\", was the first of several major actions around the Matanikau River during the campaign.\nOn 20 August, the escort carrier delivered a squadron of 19 Grumman F4F Wildcats and a squadron of 12 Douglas SBD Dauntlesses to Henderson Field. The airfield's rudimentary nature meant that carrier aircraft, designed for rough landings on flight decks at sea, were more suited for use on Henderson Field than ground-based planes. The aircraft based at Henderson became known as the \"Cactus Air Force\", after the Allied codename for Guadalcanal, \"Cactus\". The Marine fighters went into action the next day, which also saw the first of what would become almost-daily Japanese bomber air raids on the airfield. On 22 August five U.S. Army Bell P-400 Airacobras and their pilots arrived at Henderson Field.\nBattle of the Tenaru.\nIn response to the Allied landings, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters assigned the task of retaking Guadalcanal to the Imperial Japanese Army's (IJA) 17th Army, a corps-sized command based at Rabaul under the command of Lieutenant General Harukichi Hyakutake. The army was to be supported by Japanese naval units, including the Combined Fleet under the command of Isoroku Yamamoto, which was headquartered at Truk. The 17th Army, at that time heavily involved in the Japanese campaign in New Guinea, had only a few units available to allocate to Guadalcanal. Of these, the 35th Infantry Brigade under Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi was at Palau, the 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment under Major General Yumio Nasu was in the Philippines and the 28th (Ichiki) Infantry Regiment, under the command of Colonel Kiyonao Ichiki, was berthed on transport ships near Guam. These units began to move towards Guadalcanal via Truk and Rabaul immediately, but Ichiki's regiment, being the closest, arrived in the area first. A \"First Element\" of Ichiki's unit, consisting of about 917 soldiers, was landed by IJN destroyers at Taivu Point, east of the Lunga perimeter, after midnight on 19 August, then conducted a night march west toward the Marine perimeter.\nUnderestimating the strength of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, Ichiki's unit conducted a nighttime frontal assault on Marine positions at Alligator Creek (often called the \"Ilu River\" on U.S. Marine maps) on the east side of the Lunga perimeter in the early morning hours of 21 August. Jacob Vouza, a Solomon Islands Coastwatcher scout, warned the Americans of the impending attack minutes before it started; the attack was defeated with heavy losses to the Japanese. After daybreak, the Marine units counterattacked Ichiki's surviving troops, killing many more of them. The dead included Ichiki; it has been reported that he died by seppuku after realizing the magnitude of his defeat. In total, 789 of the original 917 members of the Ichiki Regiment's First Element were killed in the battle. About 30 survived the battle and joined Ichiki's rear guard of about 100, and these 128 Japanese returned to Taivu Point, notified 17th Army headquarters of their defeat and awaited further reinforcements and orders from Rabaul.\nBattle of the Eastern Solomons.\nAs the Tenaru battle was ending, more Japanese reinforcements were already on their way to Guadalcanal. Yamamoto had organized an extremely powerful naval expeditionary force, with the goal of destroying any American fleet units in the Solomons and subsequently eliminating Allied ground forces at Henderson Field. This force sortied from Truk on 23 August. Several other IJN units carrying reinforcements and supplies, and ships tasked with naval bombardment of the island, sortied from both Truk and Rabaul. Three slow transport ships departed from Truk on 16 August, carrying the remaining 1,400 soldiers from Ichiki's (28th) Infantry Regiment plus 500 naval marines from the 5th Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force. The transports were guarded by 13\u00a0warships commanded by Japanese Rear Admiral Raiz\u014d Tanaka, who planned to land the troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August. To cover the landing of these troops and provide support for the operation to retake Henderson Field from Allied forces, Yamamoto directed Ch\u016bichi Nagumo to sortie with a carrier force from Truk on 21 August and sail toward the southern Solomon Islands. Nagumo's force included three carriers and 30 other warships. Yamamoto would send the light carrier ahead of the rest of the Japanese fleet to act as bait to draw the American aircraft into combat. The aircraft from the two fleet carriers would then attack the American fleet while it lacked air cover.\nSimultaneously, the U.S. carrier task force under Fletcher approached Guadalcanal to counter the Japanese offensive efforts. On 24 August, the two carrier forces located and launched strikes against each other. The Japanese had two fleet carriers, the and , as well as the light carrier \"Ry\u016bj\u014d\", with a total of 177 carrier-based aircraft. The American forces had two carriers, the \"Saratoga\" and , and their 176 aircraft. The Japanese light carrier \"Ry\u016bj\u014d\", offered as bait to Allied naval aircraft, was hit by several bombs and an aerial torpedo; she was abandoned by her crew and sank that night. The two Japanese fleet carriers were not attacked, but Japanese aircraft successfully attacked \"Enterprise\", badly damaging her flight deck. Both fleets subsequently retreated from the area. The Japanese lost the \"Ry\u016bj\u014d\", along with dozens of carrier aircraft and most of their aircrew; the Americans lost a handful of planes and suffered damage to \"Enterprise\" requiring two months to repair in Hawaii. Unable to safely land on \"Enterprise's\" ruined flight deck, many of her remaining aircraft flew to Guadalcanal and reinforced the beleaguered American air units at Henderson Field. \nConcurrently to the carrier air battle, on 25 August, Tanaka's convoy, headed by the flagship , was attacked near Taivu Point by Cactus Air Force aircraft based at Henderson Field. After suffering heavy damage during the battle, including the sinking of one of the transports, the convoy was forced to divert to the Shortland Islands in the northern Solomons in order to transfer the surviving troops to destroyers for later delivery to Guadalcanal. A Japanese transport was sunk, and the older destroyer \"Mutsuki\" was so badly damaged that she had to be scuttled. Several other Japanese warships were damaged, including Tanaka's flagship \"Jints\u016b\". At this point, Tanaka withdrew and rescheduled the supply run for the night of 28 August, to be carried out by the remaining destroyers. Japanese air raids against the Allied positions on Guadalcanal continued largely unabated during this time.\nOn 25 August, the American carrier , after refueling, positioned herself east of Guadalcanal, expecting Japanese movement to the area. No Japanese forces made any movement towards the area, however, and the \"Wasp\" was left idle.\nThe Americans had won a modest tactical victory with the destruction of the \"Ry\u016bj\u014d,\" destroying some 75 Japanese aircraft while losing 25 of their own. The forced withdrawal of Tanaka's troop convoy also bought valuable breathing room for the embattled Allied troops on Guadalcanal. While the \"Enterprise\" was taken out of action for repair for several months, she was able to return to sea later in the campaign. The temporary loss of \"Enterprise\" was offset by the timely arrival of the carrier \"Hornet\". Additionally, the reinforcement of Henderson Field by \"Enterprise\"'s orphaned carrier aircraft bolstered ground-based Allied air strength on the island, while ground-based Japanese pilots based at Rabaul were forced to undertake a grueling day-long round-trip flight in order to make their attacks. These factors combined to render daylight supply runs to Guadalcanal impossible for the Japanese. Only weeks before this, the Japanese had total control of the sea in the region; now they were forced to make supply runs only under the cover of darkness. Japanese naval commanders began to recognize the reality that their ships could not safely operate in the Solomons in the daytime without first suppressing Allied airpower at Henderson Field.\nTransport Division 12.\nFor six weeks, from early August to the end of September, the U.S. Navy largely avoided the waters off Tulagi and Guadalcanal, and was ordered not to resupply the Marines or provide escort duty for slow transport ships, as American naval commanders feared a repeat of the disastrous defeat at Savo Island suffered by Australian and American surface vessels on 9 August. Transport Division 12 (Trans Div 12), consisting of six obsolete World War I-era s converted to high-speed transports, were the most heavily armed U.S. surface ships operating in Ironbottom Sound during this time. Their torpedo tubes were retrofitted to hold landing craft boats, enough to carry over 100 extra Marines for rapid transportation. They landed the first Marines onto Tulagi and later on Guadalcanal, conducted special operations missions with Marine Raiders, participated in anti-submarine warfare, and provided covering fire for the Marines on Guadalcanal. They also directly delivered crucial supplies to the Marines that helped to construct Henderson Field and to maintain the aircraft stationed there.\nOn 30 August was bombed by Japanese high-altitude horizontal bombers and sank with the loss of 51 men. On 4\u20135 September, and had finished landing a complement of Marine Raiders back onto Guadalcanal and proceeded to patrol the area for submarines, which had been surfacing and shelling the Marines nightly. Three Japanese destroyers, which did not know that enemy surface ships were patrolling the area, positioned themselves to attack Henderson Field. They were spotted by two American destroyer-transports, and initially identified as a submarine. A U.S. patrol plane also misidentified the destroyers as an enemy submarine at nighttime and dropped flares over the area, inadvertently silhouetting \"Little\" and \"Gregory\". The Japanese destroyers immediately fired on and sank the overmatched American ships. 65 men from \"Little\" were killed and 24 men from \"Gregory\" were killed, including the commanding officer of Transport Division 12 and the commanding officers of both ships.\nAir battles over Henderson Field and strengthening of the Lunga defenses.\nThroughout August, small numbers of American aircraft and their crews continued to arrive at Guadalcanal. By the end of August, 64 planes of various types were stationed at Henderson Field. On 3 September, the commander of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing, U.S. Marine Brigadier General Roy Geiger, arrived with his staff and took command of all air operations at Henderson Field. Air battles between the Allied aircraft at Henderson and Japanese bombers and fighters from Rabaul continued almost daily. Between 26 August and 5 September, the U.S. lost about 15\u00a0aircraft to the Japanese's approximately 19. More than half of the U.S. aircrews shot down were rescued; most of the Japanese aircrews were not. The eight-hour round-trip flight from Rabaul to Guadalcanal, about , seriously hampered Japanese efforts to establish air superiority over Henderson Field. Throughout the campaign, Rabaul-based Japanese aircrew had to fly almost 600 miles before combat with Allied pilots operating in the immediate area of Henderson Field. The Japanese navy also did not systematically rotate their veteran pilots out of combat zones. This steadily exhausted and depleted Japanese air power in the region. From a strategic standpoint, the overall quality of Japanese aviation in the Solomons deteriorated as worn-out veteran pilots were replaced by inexperienced aircrew with minimal combat experience. Australian coastwatchers on Bougainville and New Georgia islands were often able to provide Allied forces on Guadalcanal with advance notice of approaching Japanese air strikes, allowing the U.S. fighters time to take off and position themselves to attack the Japanese aircraft as they approached. The Japanese air forces were slowly losing a war of attrition in the skies above Guadalcanal.\nDuring this time, Vandegrift continued to direct efforts to strengthen and improve the defenses of the Lunga perimeter. Between 21 August and 3 September, he relocated three Marine battalions, including the 1st Raider Battalion, under Merritt A. Edson (Edson's Raiders), and the 1st Parachute Battalion from Tulagi and Gavutu to Guadalcanal. These units added about 1,500 troops to Vandegrift's original 11,000 men defending Henderson Field. The 1st Parachute Battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu\u2013Tanambogo in August, was placed under Edson's command.\nThe other relocated battalion, the 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, was landed by boat west of the Matanikau near Kokumbuna village on 27 August with the mission of attacking Japanese units in the area, much as in the first Matanikau action of 19 August. The Marines were impeded by difficult terrain, hot sun, and well-emplaced Japanese defenses. The next morning, the Marines found that the Japanese defenders had departed during the night, so the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter by boat. These actions resulted in the loss of 20 Japanese and 3 Marines.\nSmall Allied naval convoys arrived at Guadalcanal on 23 and 29 August, and 1 and 8 September to provide the Marines at Lunga with more food, ammunition, aircraft fuel, aircraft technicians, and other supplies. The convoy on 1 September also brought 392 Seabees to maintain and improve Henderson Field. In addition, on 3 September, Marine Aircraft Group 25 began airlifting high-priority cargo, including personnel, aviation gasoline, munitions, and other supplies, to Henderson Field.\nTokyo Express.\nBy 23 August, Kawaguchi's 35th Infantry Brigade reached Truk and was loaded onto slow transport ships for the rest of the trip to Guadalcanal. The damage done to Tanaka's convoy during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons caused the Japanese to reconsider trying to deliver more troops to Guadalcanal via slow transport. Instead, the ships carrying Kawaguchi's soldiers were rerouted to Rabaul. From there, the Japanese planned to deliver Kawaguchi's unit to Guadalcanal using fast destroyers at night, staging through a Japanese naval base in the Shortland Islands. The Japanese destroyers were usually able to make round trips down \"The Slot\" (New Georgia Sound) to Guadalcanal and back in a single night throughout the campaign, which minimized their exposure to daytime Allied air attack. These runs became known as the \"Tokyo Express\" to Allied forces, and were labeled \"rat transportation\" by the Japanese. While troops could be transported in this manner, most of the heavy equipment such as heavy artillery and vehicles, and supplies such as food and ammunition, could not. In addition, this activity tied up destroyers that the IJN desperately needed to escort convoys elsewhere in the Pacific. The Byzantine nature of the Japanese navy's command setup in the region exacerbated these logistical problems; Tanaka was receiving contradictory orders from the Combined Fleet headquarters and two rival subordinate naval commands at Rabaul, the Eleventh Air Fleet and the Eighth Fleet. Regardless, Tanaka's persistent destroyer operations gradually increased the strength of the forces available to Kawaguchi on the island. A combination of inability and unwillingness prevented Allied naval commanders from frequently challenging Japanese naval forces at night, so the Japanese effectively controlled the seas around the Solomon Islands after sunset. Conversely, the growing Allied airpower at Henderson Field (which was further reinforced on September 11\u201312 by 24 Wildcats that had been made homeless by the torpedoing of the carrier \"Saratoga\" in early September by IJN submarine \"I-26\") meant that any Japanese vessel within range () of Guadalcanal in daylight was at great risk from air attack. This tactical situation, wherein Japanese naval forces operated freely at night and Allied aircraft enjoyed local air superiority during the day, persisted for the next several months of the campaign.\nBetween 29 August and 4 September, Japanese light cruisers, destroyers, and patrol boats were able to land almost 5,000 troops at Taivu Point, including most of the 35th Infantry Brigade, much of the Aoba (4th) Regiment, and the rest of Ichiki's regiment. General Kawaguchi, who landed at Taivu Point on 31 August, was placed in command of all Japanese forces on Guadalcanal. A barge convoy took another 1,000 soldiers of Kawaguchi's brigade, under the command of Colonel Akinosuke Oka, to Kamimbo, west of the Lunga perimeter.\nBattle of Edson's Ridge.\nOn 7 September, Kawaguchi issued his attack plan to \"rout and annihilate the enemy in the vicinity of the Guadalcanal Island airfield\". Kawaguchi's plan called for the forces under his command, split into three divisions, to approach the Lunga perimeter inland, culminating with a surprise night attack. Oka's forces would attack the perimeter from the west, while Ichiki's Second Echelon, renamed the Kuma Battalion, would attack from the east. The main attack would be conducted from the jungle south of the Lunga perimeter by Kawaguchi's \"Center Body\", numbering 3,000 men in three battalions. By 7 September, most of Kawaguchi's troops had departed Taivu to begin marching towards Lunga Point along the coastline. About 250 Japanese troops remained behind to guard the brigade's supply base at Taivu.\nMeanwhile, native scouts under the direction of Martin Clemens, a coastwatcher officer in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force and the British district officer for Guadalcanal, brought reports to the U.S. Marines of Japanese troops at Taivu near the village of Tasimboko. Edson subsequently planned a raid on the Japanese troop concentration at Taivu. On 8 September, after being dropped off near Taivu by boat, Edson's men captured Tasimboko and forced the Japanese defenders to retreat into the jungle. In Tasimboko, Edson's troops discovered Kawaguchi's main supply depot, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition, medical supplies, and a powerful shortwave radio. After destroying everything in sight, aside from some documents and equipment that were carried back with them, the Marines returned to the Lunga perimeter. Intelligence gathered from the captured documents indicated that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island, planning to initiate a large-scale ground assault on the airfield in short order.\nEdson, along with Colonel Gerald C. Thomas, Vandegrift's operations officer, correctly anticipated that the main Japanese attack would fall upon Lunga Ridge, a narrow, grassy, coral ridge that ran parallel to the Lunga River, just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area, and was almost undefended. On 11 September, the 840 men of Edson's battalion were deployed onto and around the ridge and began digging in.\nOn the night of 12 September, Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion attacked the Raiders between the Lunga River and ridge, forcing one Marine company to fall back to the ridge before the Japanese halted their attack for the night. The next night Kawaguchi faced Edson's 840 Raiders with 3,000 troops of his brigade, reinforced by an assortment of light artillery. The Japanese began their attack just after nightfall, with Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion assaulting Edson's right flank just to the west of the ridge. After breaking through the Marine lines, the battalion's assault was eventually stopped by Marine units occupying the northern section of the ridge.\nTwo companies from Kawaguchi's 2nd Battalion charged up the southern edge of the ridge and pushed Edson's troops back to Hill\u00a0123, in the center section of the ridge. Throughout the night the Marines at this position, supported by a battery of howitzers brought up from Lunga Point, turned back wave after wave of frontal Japanese infantry attacks, several of which devolved into hand-to-hand combat. The weight of these repeated assaults eventually pressed the Marines back to within a quarter mile of the airfield. At this stage, as the intensity of the battle reached its apex, small groups of Japanese soldiers managed to break through Edson's lines, with some reaching the edge of the airfield itself. Several Japanese soldiers were killed as they attempted to climb onto and destroy parked aircraft, and General Vandegrift's command post even came under direct attack at dawn, with several Japanese infiltrators killed within sight of the general. Nonetheless, Kawaguchi's units were spent, and the main Japanese attack on Edson's positions ground to a halt. The supporting attacks by the Kuma Battalion and Oka's unit at other locations on the Lunga perimeter were likewise defeated. On 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade on a five-day march west to the Matanikau Valley to join with Oka's unit. In total Kawaguchi's forces lost about 850 killed, with the Marines suffering 104.\nOn 15 September at Rabaul, Hyakutake learned of Kawaguchi's defeat and forwarded the news to Imperial General Headquarters in Japan. In an emergency meeting, the senior Japanese IJA and IJN command staffs concluded that \"Guadalcanal might develop into the decisive battle of the war\". The results of the battle now began to exert significant strategic impact on Japanese operations in other areas of the Pacific. Hyakutake realized that he could not send sufficient men and materiel to defeat the Allied forces on Guadalcanal while simultaneously supporting the major ongoing Japanese offensive on the Kokoda Track in New Guinea. Hyakutake, with the concurrence of General Headquarters, ordered his troops on New Guinea, who were within of their objective of Port Moresby, to withdraw until the \"Guadalcanal matter\" was resolved. Hyakutake prepared to send more troops to Guadalcanal for another attempt to recapture Henderson Field.\nAllied reinforcement.\nAs the Japanese regrouped west of the Matanikau, the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their Lunga defenses. On 14 September Vandegrift moved another battalion (3rd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment) from Tulagi to Guadalcanal. On 18 September, an Allied naval convoy delivered 4,157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade (the 7th Marine Regiment plus a battalion from the 11th Marine Regiment and some additional support units), 137 vehicles, tents, aviation fuel, ammunition, rations, and engineering equipment to Guadalcanal. These crucial reinforcements allowed Vandegrift, beginning on 19 September, to establish an unbroken line of defense around the Lunga perimeter. While covering this convoy, the aircraft carrier was scuttled after being struck by torpedoes from the Japanese submarine southeast of Guadalcanal. This stretched Allied naval airpower thin, with only one aircraft carrier () remaining in operation in the entire South Pacific Area. Vandegrift also made some changes in the senior leadership of his combat units, transferring several officers who did not meet his performance standards off the island and promoting junior officers who had proven themselves to take their place. One of these was the recently promoted Colonel Merritt Edson, who was placed in command of the 5th Marine Regiment.\nA lull occurred in the air war over Guadalcanal, with no Japanese air raids between 14 and 27 September because of bad weather, during which both sides reinforced their respective air units. The Japanese delivered 85 fighters and bombers to their air units at Rabaul, while the U.S. sent a further 23 fighters and attack aircraft to Henderson Field. By 20 September the Japanese had 117 total aircraft at Rabaul, while the Allies tallied 71 aircraft at Henderson Field. The air war resumed with a Japanese air raid on Guadalcanal on 27 September, which was contested by U.S. Navy and Marine fighters from Henderson Field.\nThe Japanese immediately began to prepare for their next attempt to recapture Henderson Field. The 3rd Battalion, 4th (Aoba) Infantry Regiment had landed at Kamimbo Bay on the western end of Guadalcanal on 11 September - too late to join Kawaguchi's attack, but in time to join Oka's forces near the Matanikau. Tokyo Express runs by IJN destroyers on 14, 20, 21 and 24 September brought food and ammunition as well as 280\u00a0men from the 1st Battalion, Aoba Regiment, to Kamimbo Bay. Meanwhile, the Japanese 2nd and 38th Infantry Divisions were transported from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul, beginning on 13 September. The Japanese planned to transport a total of 17,500 troops from these two divisions to Guadalcanal to take part in the next major attack on the Lunga perimeter by late October.\nActions along the Matanikau.\nVandegrift and his staff were aware that Kawaguchi's troops had retreated to the area west of the Matanikau, and that numerous groups of Japanese stragglers were scattered throughout the area between the Lunga perimeter and the Matanikau River. Vandegrift therefore decided to conduct another series of small unit operations around the Matanikau Valley. Their purpose was to mop up scattered groups of Japanese troops east of the Matanikau and to keep the main body of Japanese soldiers off-balance, preventing them from consolidating positions so close to the main Marine defenses at Lunga Point.\nAn attack on Japanese forces west of the Matanikau was conducted between 23 and 27 September by elements of three U.S. Marine battalions. The attack was repulsed by Kawaguchi's troops under Akinosuke Oka's local command. During the action three Marine companies were surrounded by Japanese forces near Point Cruz west of the Matanikau, took heavy losses, and escaped only due to assistance from the destroyer and landing craft crewed by U.S. Coast Guard personnel. One of those was piloted by Douglas Munro, who was killed as he maneuvered his craft to protect the escaping Marines and became the only Coast Guardsman to be awarded the Medal of Honor.\nBetween 6 and 9 October a larger force of Marines successfully crossed the Matanikau River, attacked newly landed Japanese forces from the 2nd Infantry Division under the command of Generals Masao Maruyama and Yumio Nasu, and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese 4th Infantry Regiment. This action forced the Japanese to retreat from their positions east of the Matanikau and hindered Japanese preparations for their planned major offensive on the U.S. Lunga defenses. Between 9 and 11 October the U.S. 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines raided two small Japanese outposts about east of the Lunga perimeter at Gurabusu and Koilotumaria near Aola Bay. These raids killed 35 Japanese at a cost of 17 Marines and 3 U.S. Navy personnel killed.\nBattle of Cape Esperance.\nThroughout the last week of September and the first week of October, Tokyo Express runs continually delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division to Guadalcanal. The Japanese Navy promised to support the IJA's planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and also by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.\nIn the meantime, Millard F. Harmon, commander of U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific, convinced Ghormley that U.S. Marine forces on Guadalcanal needed to be reinforced immediately if the Allies were to successfully defend the island from the next expected Japanese offensive. Thus, on 8 October, the 2,837 men of the 164th Infantry Regiment from the Americal Division boarded ships at New Caledonia for the trip to Guadalcanal with a projected arrival date of 13 October. To protect the transports carrying the 164th to Guadalcanal, Ghormley ordered Task Force 64, consisting of four cruisers and five destroyers under U.S. Rear Admiral Norman Scott, to intercept and combat any Japanese ships that approached Guadalcanal and threatened the arrival of the transport convoy.\nMikawa's 8th Fleet staff scheduled a substantial Express run for the night of 11 October. Two seaplane tenders and six destroyers were ordered to put 728 soldiers, along with artillery and ammunition, ashore on Guadalcanal. At the same time, in a separate operation, three heavy cruisers and two destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Aritomo Got\u014d were to bombard Henderson Field with special explosive shells with the objective of destroying the Cactus Air Force and the airfield's facilities. Because U.S. Navy warships had not yet attempted to interdict any Tokyo Express missions to Guadalcanal, the Japanese were not expecting any opposition from Allied naval surface forces that night.\nJust before midnight, Scott's warships detected Got\u014d's force on radar near the entrance to the strait between Savo Island and Guadalcanal. Scott's force was in a position to cross the T on Got\u014d's unsuspecting formation. Opening fire, Scott's warships sank a cruiser and a destroyer, heavily damaged another cruiser, mortally wounded Got\u014d, and forced the rest of Got\u014d's warships to abandon their bombardment mission and retreat. During the exchange of gunfire, one of Scott's destroyers was sunk, and one cruiser and another destroyer were heavily damaged. In the meantime, the Japanese supply convoy successfully completed unloading at Guadalcanal and began its return journey without being discovered by Scott's force.\nLater on the morning of 12 October, four Japanese destroyers from the supply convoy turned back to assist Got\u014d's retreating, damaged warships. Air attacks by CAF aircraft from Henderson Field sank two of these destroyers later that day. Meanwhile, the convoy of U.S. Army troops reached Guadalcanal as scheduled on 13 October, successfully delivering its cargo and passengers to the island.\nHenderson Field.\nBattleship bombardment.\nDespite the U.S. victory off Cape Esperance, the Japanese continued with plans and preparations for their large offensive scheduled for later in October. The Japanese decided to risk a rare departure from their usual practice of only using fast warships to deliver men and materiel to the island. On 13 October, a convoy comprising six cargo ships escorted by eight screening destroyers departed the Shortland Islands for Guadalcanal. The convoy carried 4,500 troops from the 16th and 230th Infantry Regiments, some naval marines, two batteries of heavy artillery, and one company of tanks.\nTo protect the approaching convoy from attack by CAF aircraft, Yamamoto sent the 3rd Battleship Division from Truk to bombard Henderson Field, under the command of Takeo Kurita. At 01:33 on 14 October, IJN battleships and , escorted by one light cruiser and nine destroyers, reached Guadalcanal and opened fire on Henderson Field from a distance of . At this range, over ten miles (16 km), Allied shore batteries had no prospect of returning effective fire. Over the next one hour and 23 minutes, the two battleships fired 973 shells into the Lunga perimeter, most of which fell in and around the area of the airfield. Many of the shells were fragmentation shells, specifically designed to destroy land targets. The bombardment heavily damaged both runways, burned almost all of the available aviation fuel, and destroyed 48 of the CAF's 90 aircraft. 41 men were killed, including six CAF pilots. Few CAF aircraft survived entirely unscathed, and only about a dozen remained in flyable condition the next day. Wrecked and damaged planes were lined up wingtip to wingtip, in the hopes of diverting Japanese attention from the few surviving aircraft. After exhausting their ammunition around 3 a.m., the Japanese battleship force immediately returned to Truk. Allied troops stationed at Henderson Field colloquially referred to this bombardment, the heaviest they had endured thus far in the campaign, as \"The Night\". \nDespite the heavy damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore one of the runways to operational condition within a few hours. Seventeen SBD-3 Dauntless dive bombers and 20 F4F Wildcats at Espiritu Santo were quickly flown to Henderson, and U.S. Army and Marine transport aircraft shuttled aviation gasoline from Espiritu Santo to Guadalcanal. Aware of the approach of the large Japanese reinforcement convoy, the U.S. desperately sought a way to interdict the convoy before it could reach Guadalcanal. Using fuel drained from destroyed aircraft and from a cache in the nearby jungle, the CAF attacked the convoy twice on 14 October but caused no damage.\nThe Japanese convoy reached Tassafaronga Point at midnight on 14 October and began unloading. Throughout the day of 15 October, a string of CAF aircraft from Henderson bombed and strafed the unloading convoy, destroying three of the cargo ships. The remainder of the convoy departed that night, having unloaded all of the troops and about two-thirds of the supplies and equipment. Several Japanese heavy cruisers also bombarded Henderson on the nights of 14 and 15 October, destroying a few additional CAF aircraft but failing to inflict further significant damage to the airfield.\nBattle for Henderson Field.\nBetween 1 and 17 October, the Japanese delivered 15,000 troops to Guadalcanal, giving Hyakutake 20,000 total troops to employ for his planned offensive. Because of the loss of their positions on the east side of the Matanikau, the Japanese decided that an attack on the U.S. defenses along the coast would be prohibitively difficult. Therefore, Hyakutake decided that the main thrust of his planned attack would be from south of Henderson Field. His 2nd Division (augmented by troops from the 38th Division), under Maruyama and comprising 7,000 soldiers in three infantry regiments of three battalions each was ordered to march through the jungle and attack the American defenses from the south, near the east bank of the Lunga River. The date of the attack was set for 22 October, then changed to 23 October. To distract the Americans from the planned attack from the south, Hyakutake's heavy artillery plus five battalions of infantry (about 2,900 men) under Major General Tadashi Sumiyoshi were to attack the American defenses from the west along the coastal corridor. The Japanese estimated that there were 10,000 American troops on the island, when in fact there were about 23,000. Despite this, American commanders were pessimistic about their ability to repulse another concerted Japanese attack on the airfield. Units were given orders to fight as guerrillas should they be overrun by the Japanese, and the 1st Marine Division's intelligence staff began burning their classified records. Speaking to reporters in Washington, D.C., Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox refused to publicly guarantee that Guadalcanal could be held. \nOn 12 October, a company of Japanese engineers began to break a trail, called the \"Maruyama Road\", from the Matanikau towards the southern portion of the U.S. Lunga perimeter. The trail traversed some of the most difficult terrain on Guadalcanal, including numerous rivers and streams, deep, muddy ravines, steep ridges, and dense jungle. Between 16 and 18 October, the 2nd Division began their march along the Maruyama Road.\nBy 23 October, Maruyama's forces were still struggling through the jungle to reach the American lines. That evening, after learning that his forces had yet to reach their attack positions, Hyakutake postponed the attack to 19:00 on 24 October. The Americans remained unaware of the approach of Maruyama's forces.\nSumiyoshi was informed by Hyakutake's staff of the postponement of the offensive to 24 October, but he was unable to contact his troops to inform them of the delay. Thus, at dusk on 23 October, two battalions of the 4th Infantry Regiment and the nine tanks of the 1st Independent Tank Company launched attacks on the U.S. Marine defenses at the mouth of the Matanikau. U.S. Marine artillery, cannon, and small arms fire repulsed the attacks, destroying all the tanks and killing many of the Japanese soldiers while suffering only light casualties.\nFinally, late on 24 October, Maruyama's forces reached the Lunga perimeter. Over two consecutive nights Maruyama's forces conducted numerous frontal assaults on positions defended by troops of the 1st Battalion, 7th Marines under Lieutenant Colonel Chesty Puller and the U.S. Army's 3rd Battalion, 164th Infantry Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Robert Hall. U.S. Marine and Army units armed with rifles, machine guns, mortars, and artillery, including direct canister fire from 37 mm anti-tank guns, \"wrought terrible carnage\" on the Japanese. A few small groups of Japanese broke through the American defenses, but were hunted down and killed over the next several days. More than 1,500 of Maruyama's troops were killed in the attacks, while the Americans lost about 60 killed. Over the same two days American aircraft from Henderson Field defended against attacks by Japanese aircraft and warships, destroying 14 aircraft and sinking light cruiser .\nFurther Japanese attacks near the Matanikau on 26 October were also repulsed with heavy losses for the Japanese. As a result, by 08:00 on 26 October, Hyakutake called off any further attacks and ordered his forces to retreat. About half of Maruyama's survivors were ordered to retreat back to the upper Matanikau Valley while the 230th Infantry Regiment under Colonel Toshinari Sh\u014dji was told to head for Koli Point, east of the Lunga perimeter. Leading elements of the 2nd Division reached the 17th Army headquarters area at Kokumbona, west of the Matanikau on 4 November. The same day, Sh\u014dji's unit reached Koli Point and made camp. Decimated by combat losses, malnutrition, and tropical diseases, the 2nd Division was incapable of further offensive action and fought as a defensive force along the coast for the rest of the campaign. In total, the Japanese lost 2,200\u20133,000 troops in the battle while the Americans lost around 80 killed.\nBattle of the Santa Cruz Islands.\nAt the same time that Hyakutake's troops were attacking the Lunga perimeter, a large Japanese naval force consisting of two fleet carriers (\"Shokaku\" and \"Zuikaku\"), two other light carriers, four battleships and various supporting vessels moved into a position near the southern Solomon Islands. Under the overall command of Yamamoto, this fleet was the largest that the Japanese had assembled since the Battle of Midway. Yamamoto's goal was to draw the bulk of Allied naval strength in the region, specifically the American aircraft carriers, into a decisive sea battle at the same time that Japanese troops on Guadalcanal were attacking the airfield in force. Allied naval carrier forces in the area, under the overall command of William Halsey Jr., also hoped to meet the Japanese naval forces in battle. Nimitz had replaced Ghormley with Admiral Halsey on 18 October after concluding that Ghormley had become too pessimistic and myopic to effectively continue leading Allied forces in the South Pacific Area. Due to faulty reports from Hyakutake that his ground forces had seized the airfield over the night of October 25, Yamamoto ordered his task force to sail south and seek out the American fleet.\nThe two opposing carrier forces confronted each other on the morning of 26 October, in what became known as the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, the last carrier battle of the war in the Pacific until the Battle of the Philippine Sea nearly two years later. After an exchange of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships were forced to retreat from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk (\"Hornet\") and another () heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retired because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and significant damage to two carriers. Although the Japanese had apparently secured a tactical victory in terms of ships sunk and damaged, their loss of almost 150 veteran carrier pilots provided a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low. Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, Allied forces were far more successful in recovering downed pilots (both ground-based and carrier-based) than the Japanese. Japanese carriers would play no further significant role in the campaign.\nNovember land actions.\nIn order to exploit the victory in the Battle for Henderson Field, Vandegrift sent six Marine battalions, later joined by one Army battalion, on an offensive west of the Matanikau. The operation was commanded by Merritt Edson and its goal was to capture Kokumbona, headquarters of the 17th Army, west of Point Cruz. Defending the Point Cruz area were Japanese army troops from the 4th Infantry Regiment commanded by Nomasu Nakaguma. The 4th Infantry was severely understrength because of battle damage, tropical disease, and malnutrition. \nThe American offensive began on 1 November and succeeded in destroying Japanese forces defending the Point Cruz area by 3 November, including troops sent to reinforce Nakaguma's battered regiment. The Americans appeared to be on the verge of breaking through the Japanese defenses and capturing Kokumbona. At this time, however, other American forces discovered and engaged newly landed Japanese troops near Koli Point on the eastern side of the Lunga perimeter. To counter this new threat, Vandegrift temporarily halted the Matanikau offensive on 4 November. The Americans suffered 71 killed and the Japanese around 400 killed in the offensive.\nAt Koli Point early in the morning 3 November, five Japanese destroyers delivered 300 army troops to support Sh\u014dji and his troops who were en route to Koli Point after the Battle for Henderson Field. Having learned of the planned landing, Vandegrift sent a battalion of Marines under Herman H. Hanneken to intercept the Japanese at Koli. Soon after landing, the Japanese soldiers encountered and drove Hanneken's battalion back towards the Lunga perimeter. In response, Vandegrift ordered Puller's Marine battalion plus two of the 164th infantry battalions, along with Hanneken's battalion, to move towards Koli Point to attack the Japanese forces there.\nAs the American troops began to move, Sh\u014dji and his soldiers began to arrive at Koli Point. Beginning on 8 November, the American troops attempted to encircle Sh\u014dji's forces at Gavaga Creek near Koli Point. Meanwhile, Hyakutake ordered Sh\u014dji to abandon his positions at Koli and rejoin Japanese forces at Kokumbona in the Matanikau area. A gap existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines. Between 9 and 11 November, Sh\u014dji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men escaped into the jungle to the south. On 12 November, the Americans completely overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left in the pocket. The Americans counted the bodies of 450\u2013475 Japanese dead in the Koli Point area and captured most of Sh\u014dji's heavy weapons and provisions. The American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation.\nMeanwhile, on 4 November, two companies from the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson landed by boat at Aola Bay, east of Lunga Point. Carlson's raiders, along with troops from the Army's 147th Infantry Regiment, were to provide security for 500\u00a0Seabees as they attempted to construct an airfield at that location. Halsey, acting on a recommendation by Turner, had approved the Aola Bay airfield construction effort; however it was abandoned at the end of November because of unsuitable terrain.\nOn 5 November, Vandegrift ordered Carlson and his raiders to march overland from Aola and attack any of Sh\u014dji's forces that had escaped from Koli Point. With the rest of the companies from his battalion, which arrived a few days later, Carlson and his troops set off on a 29-day patrol from Aola to the Lunga perimeter. During the patrol, the raiders fought several battles with Sh\u014dji's retreating forces, killing almost 500 of them, while suffering 16 killed. Tropical diseases and a lack of food felled more of Sh\u014dji's men. By the time Sh\u014dji's forces reached the Lunga River in mid-November, about halfway to the Matanikau, only 1,300\u00a0men remained with the main body. When Sh\u014dji reached the 17th Army positions west of the Matanikau, only 700 to 800 survivors were still with him. Most of the survivors from Sh\u014dji's force joined other Japanese units defending the Mount Austen and upper Matanikau River area. \nTokyo Express runs on 5, 7, and 9 November delivered additional troops from the Japanese 38th Infantry Division, including most of the 228th Infantry Regiment. These fresh troops were quickly placed in the Point Cruz and Matanikau area and helped successfully resist further attacks by American forces on 10 and 18 November. The Americans and Japanese remained facing each other along a line just west of Point Cruz for the next six weeks.\nNaval Battle of Guadalcanal.\nAfter the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the IJA planned to try again to retake the airfield in November 1942, but further reinforcements were needed before the operation could proceed. The IJA requested assistance from Yamamoto to deliver the needed reinforcements to the island and to support the next offensive. Yamamoto provided 11 large transport ships to carry the remaining 7,000 troops from the 38th Infantry Division, their ammunition, food, and heavy equipment from Rabaul to Guadalcanal. He also provided a warship support force that included two battleships, and , equipped with special fragmentation shells, which were to bombard Henderson Field on the night of 12\u201313 November. The goal of the bombardment was to destroy the airfield and the aircraft stationed there, to allow the slow transports to reach Guadalcanal and unload safely the next day. The warship force was commanded from \"Hiei\" by recently promoted Vice Admiral Hiroaki Abe.\nIn early November, Allied intelligence learned that the Japanese were preparing again to try to retake Henderson Field. In response, on 11 November the U.S. sent Turner's Task Force 67 to Guadalcanal, carrying Marine replacements, two U.S. Army infantry battalions, ammunition and food. The supply ships were protected by two task groups, commanded by Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott, as well as by aircraft from Henderson Field. The ships were attacked several times on 11 and 12 November by Japanese aircraft from Rabaul staging through an air base at Buin, Bougainville, but most unloaded their cargo without serious damage.\nU.S. reconnaissance aircraft spotted the approach of Abe's bombardment force and passed a warning to Allied commanders. Thus warned, Turner detached all usable combat ships under Callaghan to protect the troops ashore from the expected Japanese naval attack and troop landing, and ordered the supply ships at Guadalcanal to depart by early evening 12 November. Callaghan's force comprised two heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, and eight destroyers.\nAround 01:30 on 13 November, Callaghan's force intercepted Abe's bombardment group between Guadalcanal and Savo Island. In addition to the two battleships, Abe's force included one light cruiser and 11 destroyers. In the pitch darkness the two warship forces became intermingled before opening fire at unusually close range. In the resulting m\u00eal\u00e9e, Abe's warships sank or severely damaged all but one cruiser and one destroyer in Callaghan's force; both Callaghan and Scott were killed. Two Japanese destroyers were sunk, and another destroyer and the battleship \"Hiei\" were heavily damaged. Despite his defeat of Callaghan's force, Abe ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field. The \"Hiei\" sank later that day after repeated air attacks by aircraft from Henderson Field and the carrier \"Enterprise\". Because of Abe's failure to neutralize Henderson Field, Yamamoto ordered Tanaka's troop transport convoy, located near the Shortland Islands, to wait an additional day before heading towards Guadalcanal. Yamamoto ordered Nobutake Kond\u014d to assemble another bombardment force using warships from Truk and Abe's force to attack Henderson Field on 15 November.\nIn the meantime, around 02:00 on 14 November, a cruiser and destroyer force under Gunichi Mikawa from Rabaul conducted an unopposed bombardment of Henderson Field. The bombardment caused some damage, but failed to put the airfield or most of its aircraft out of operation. As Mikawa's force retired towards Rabaul, Tanaka's transport convoy, trusting that Henderson Field was destroyed or heavily damaged, began its run down \"the Slot\" towards Guadalcanal. Throughout the day of 14 November, aircraft from Henderson Field and the \"Enterprise\" attacked Mikawa and Tanaka's ships, sinking one heavy cruiser and seven of the transports. Most of the troops were rescued from the transports by Tanaka's escorting destroyers and returned to the Shortlands. After dark, Tanaka and the remaining four transports continued towards Guadalcanal as Kond\u014d's force approached to bombard Henderson Field.\nIn order to intercept Kond\u014d's force, Halsey, who was low on undamaged ships, detached two battleships, the and , and four destroyers from the \"Enterprise\" task force. This force, under the command of Willis A. Lee aboard the \"Washington\", reached Guadalcanal and Savo Island just before midnight on 14 November, shortly before Kond\u014d's bombardment force arrived. Kond\u014d's force consisted of the battleship \"Kirishima\", two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and nine destroyers. After the two forces made contact, Kond\u014d's force quickly sank three of the U.S. destroyers and heavily damaged the fourth. The Japanese warships then sighted, opened fire, and damaged the \"South Dakota\". As Kond\u014d's warships concentrated on the \"South Dakota\", the \"Washington\" approached the Japanese ships unobserved and opened fire on the \"Kirishima\", inflicting severe damage upon the Japanese battleship. After fruitlessly chasing the \"Washington\" towards the Russell Islands, Kond\u014d ordered his warships to retire without bombarding Henderson Field. One of Kond\u014d's destroyers was also sunk during the engagement.\nAs Kond\u014d's ships retired, the four Japanese transports beached near Tassafaronga Point on Guadalcanal at 04:00. At 05:55, U.S. aircraft and artillery began attacking the beached transports, destroying all four, along with most of the supplies that they carried. Only 2,000\u20133,000 of the IJA troops reached the shore. Because of the failure to deliver most of the troops and supplies, the Japanese were forced to cancel their planned November offensive on Henderson Field, making the battle a significant strategic victory for the Allies and marking the beginning of the end of Japanese attempts to retake Henderson Field.\nOn 26 November, Japanese Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura took command of the newly formed Eighth Area Army at Rabaul. The new command encompassed both Hyakutake's 17th Army and the 18th Army in New Guinea. One of Imamura's first priorities upon assuming command was the continuation of the attempts to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal. The Allied offensive at Buna in New Guinea, however, changed Imamura's priorities. Because the Allied attempt to take Buna was considered a more severe threat to Rabaul, Imamura postponed further major reinforcement efforts to Guadalcanal, in order to concentrate on the situation in New Guinea.\nBattle of Tassafaronga.\nBy this stage of the campaign, the Japanese were experiencing severe difficulty delivering sufficient supplies to sustain their troops on Guadalcanal. Attempts to use submarines for resupply runs in the last two weeks in November failed to provide sufficient food for Hyakutake's forces. A separate attempt to establish bases in the central Solomon Islands, which could facilitate barge convoys to Guadalcanal, also failed because of destructive and frequent Allied air attacks. On 26 November, the 17th Army notified Imamura that it faced an acute food crisis. Some front-line units had not been resupplied for six days, and even the rear-area troops were on one-third rations. The situation forced the Japanese to return to delivering supplies with destroyers, which were unable to bring the amounts required by the beleaguered IJA troops on Guadalcanal.\nThe staff of the IJN Eighth Fleet devised a plan to help reduce the exposure of destroyers delivering supplies to Guadalcanal. Large oil or gas drums were cleaned and filled with medical supplies and food, with enough air space to provide buoyancy, and strung together with rope. When the destroyers arrived at Guadalcanal they would make a sharp turn and the drums would be cut loose. A swimmer or boat from shore was to pick up the buoyed end of a rope attached to the drums and return it to the beach, where teams of soldiers could haul in the supplies.\nThe Eighth Fleet's Guadalcanal Reinforcement Unit (the Tokyo Express), commanded by Tanaka, was tasked by Mikawa with making the first of five scheduled runs to Tassafaronga using the drum method on the night of 30 November. Tanaka's unit was centered on eight destroyers, with six destroyers assigned to carry between 200 and 240 drums of supplies apiece. Notified by intelligence sources of the Japanese supply attempt, Halsey ordered the newly formed Task Force 67, comprising four cruisers and four destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Carleton H. Wright, to intercept Tanaka's force off Guadalcanal. Two additional destroyers joined Wright's force en route to Guadalcanal from Espiritu Santo during the day of 30 November.\nAt 22:40 on 30 November, Tanaka's force arrived off Guadalcanal and prepared to unload the supply barrels. Meanwhile, Wright's warships were approaching through Ironbottom Sound from the opposite direction. Wright's destroyers detected Tanaka's force on radar, and the destroyer commander requested permission to attack with torpedoes. Wright waited four minutes before giving permission, allowing Tanaka's force to escape from an optimum firing setup. All of the American torpedoes missed their targets. At the same time, Wright's cruisers opened fire, hitting and destroying one of the Japanese guard destroyers. The rest of Tanaka's warships abandoned the supply mission, increased speed, turned, and launched a total of 44 torpedoes in the direction of Wright's cruisers. The Japanese torpedoes hit and sank the U.S. cruiser and heavily damaged the cruisers , , and . The rest of Tanaka's destroyers escaped without damage but failed to deliver any of the provisions to Guadalcanal.\nBy 7 December 1942, Hyakutake's forces were losing about 50\u00a0men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. Further attempts by Tanaka's destroyer forces to deliver provisions on 3, 7 and 11 December failed to alleviate the crisis, and one of Tanaka's destroyers was sunk by a U.S. PT boat torpedo. Tanaka privately informed Admiral Mikawa that the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal could no longer be supplied by sea, and advised that they be withdrawn from the island. Tanaka was subsequently transferred to an administrative post in Singapore.\nJapanese decision to withdraw.\nOn 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. At the same time, several army staff officers at the Imperial General Headquarters (IGH) also suggested that further efforts to retake Guadalcanal would be impossible. A delegation led by Colonel Joichiro Sanada, chief of the IGH's operations section, visited Rabaul on 19 December and consulted Imamura and his staff. Upon the delegation's return to Tokyo, Sanada recommended that Guadalcanal be abandoned. The IGH's top leaders agreed with Sanada's recommendation on 26 December and ordered their staffs to begin drafting plans for a withdrawal from Guadalcanal, establishment of a new defense line in the central Solomons, and shifting priorities and resources to the campaign in New Guinea.\nOn 28 December, General Hajime Sugiyama and Admiral Osami Nagano personally informed Emperor Hirohito of the decision to withdraw from Guadalcanal. On 31 December, Hirohito formally endorsed the decision. The Japanese secretly began to prepare for the evacuation, called Operation Ke, scheduled to begin during the latter part of January 1943. By now, Japanese forces on the island had dwindled to fewer than 15,000 men.\nBattle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse.\nBy December, the weary 1st Marine Division was withdrawn for recuperation, and over the course of the next month the U.S. XIV Corps took over operations on the island. This corps consisted of the 2nd Marine Division and the U.S. Army's 25th Infantry and 23rd \"Americal\" Divisions. U.S. Army Major General Alexander Patch replaced Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal, which by January totaled just over 50,000 men.\nOn 18 December, Allied (mainly U.S. Army) forces began attacking Japanese positions on Mount Austen. A strong Japanese fortified position, called the Gifu, stymied the attacks and the Americans were forced to temporarily halt their offensive on 4 January. The Allies renewed the offensive on 10 January, attacking the Japanese on Mount Austen as well as on two nearby ridges called the Sea Horse and the Galloping Horse. After some difficulty, the Allies captured all three by 23 January. At the same time, U.S. Marines advanced along the north coast of the island, making significant gains. The Americans lost about 250 killed in the operation while the Japanese suffered around 3,000 killed, about 12 to 1 in the Americans' favor.\n\"Ke\" evacuation.\nOn 14 January, a Tokyo Express run delivered a battalion of troops to act as a rear guard for the \"Ke\" evacuation. A staff officer from Rabaul accompanied the troops to notify Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw. At the same time, Japanese warships and aircraft moved into position around the Rabaul and Bougainville areas in preparation to execute the withdrawal operation. Allied intelligence detected the Japanese movements but misinterpreted them as preparations for another attempt to retake Henderson Field and Guadalcanal.\nPatch, wary of what he thought to be an imminent Japanese offensive, committed only a relatively small portion of his troops to continue a slow-moving offensive against Hyakutake's forces. On 29 January, Halsey, acting on the same intelligence, sent a resupply convoy to Guadalcanal screened by a cruiser task force. Sighting the cruisers, Japanese naval torpedo bombers attacked that same evening and heavily damaged the cruiser . The next day, more torpedo aircraft attacked and sank \"Chicago\". Halsey ordered the remainder of the task force to return to base and directed the rest of his naval forces to take station in the Coral Sea, south of Guadalcanal, to be ready to counter a Japanese offensive.\nIn the meantime, the Japanese 17th Army withdrew to the west coast of Guadalcanal while rear guard units checked the American offensive. On the night of 1 February, a force of 20 destroyers from Mikawa's 8th Fleet under Shintar\u014d Hashimoto successfully extracted 4,935 soldiers, mainly from the 38th Division, from the island. The Japanese and Americans each lost a destroyer from an air and naval attack related to the evacuation mission.\nOn the nights of 4 and 7 February, Hashimoto and his destroyers evacuated the remaining Japanese forces from Guadalcanal. Apart from some air attacks, Allied forces were still anticipating a large Japanese offensive and did not attempt to interdict Hashimoto's evacuation runs. In total, the Japanese successfully evacuated 10,652 men from Guadalcanal. Their last troops left the island on the evening of 7 February, six months to the day from when the U.S. forces first landed. Two days later, on 9 February, Patch realized that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Japanese defeat, Guadalcanal and Tulagi were developed into major bases supporting the Allied advance further up the Solomon Islands chain. Besides Henderson Field, two additional fighter runways were constructed at Lunga Point, and a bomber airfield was built at Koli Point. Extensive naval port and logistics facilities were established at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and Florida. The anchorage around Tulagi became an important forward base for Allied warships and transport ships supporting the Solomon Islands campaign. Major ground units were staged through large encampments and barracks on Guadalcanal before deployment further up the Solomons.\nAfter Guadalcanal the Japanese were clearly on the defensive in the Pacific. The constant pressure to reinforce Guadalcanal had weakened Japanese efforts in other theaters, contributing to a successful Australian and American counteroffensive in New Guinea which culminated in the capture of the key bases of Buna and Gona in early 1943. The Allies had gained a strategic initiative which they never relinquished. In June, the Allies launched Operation Cartwheel which, after modification in August 1943, formalized the strategy of isolating Rabaul and cutting its sea lines of communication. The subsequent successful neutralization of Rabaul and the forces centered there facilitated the South West Pacific campaign under MacArthur and Central Pacific island-hopping campaign under Nimitz, with both efforts successfully advancing toward Japan. The remaining Japanese defenses in the South Pacific Area were then either destroyed or bypassed by Allied forces as the war progressed.\nMedal of Honor recipients.\nMarine Corps\nArmy\nNavy\nCoast Guard\nSignificance.\nResources.\nThe Battle of Guadalcanal was one of the first prolonged campaigns in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II. It strained logistical capabilities of the combatant nations. For the U.S., this need prompted the development of effective combat air transport for the first time. A failure to achieve air supremacy forced Japan to rely on reinforcement by barges, destroyers, and submarines, with very uneven results. Early in the campaign, the Americans were hindered by a lack of resources, as they suffered heavy losses in cruisers and carriers, with replacements from ramped-up shipbuilding programs still months away from materializing.\nThe U.S. Navy suffered such high personnel losses during the campaign that it refused to publicly release total casualty figures for years. However, as the campaign continued, and the American public became more and more aware of the plight and perceived heroism of the American forces on Guadalcanal, more forces were dispatched to the area. This spelled trouble for Japan as its military-industrial complex was unable to match the output of American industry and manpower. Thus, as the campaign wore on the Japanese were losing irreplaceable units while the Americans were rapidly replacing and even augmenting their forces.\nThe Guadalcanal campaign was costly to Japan strategically and in material losses and manpower. Roughly 30,000 personnel, including 25,000 experienced ground troops, died during the campaign. As many as three-quarters of the deaths were from non-combat causes such as starvation and various tropical diseases. The drain on resources directly contributed to Japan's failure to achieve its objectives in the New Guinea campaign. Japan also lost control of the southern Solomons and the ability to interdict Allied shipping to Australia. Japan's major base at Rabaul became further directly threatened by Allied air power. Most importantly, scarce Japanese land, air, and naval forces had disappeared forever into the Guadalcanal jungle and surrounding sea. The Japanese could not replace the aircraft destroyed and ships sunk in this campaign, as well as their highly trained and veteran crews, especially the naval aircrews, nearly as quickly as the Allies.\nStrategy.\nWhile the Battle of Midway is viewed as a turning point in the Pacific War, Japan remained on the offensive, as shown by its advances down the Solomon Islands. Only after the Allied victories in Guadalcanal and New Guinea (at Milne Bay and Buna\u2013Gona) were these large-scale Japanese offensive actions stopped. Strategic initiative passed to the Allies, as it proved, permanently. The Guadalcanal campaign ended all Japanese expansion attempts in the Pacific and placed the Allies in a position of clear supremacy. The Allied victory at Guadalcanal was the first step in a long string of successes that eventually led to the surrender and occupation of Japan.\nThe \"Europe first\" policy agreed to by the Allies had initially only allowed for defensive actions against Japanese expansion in order to focus resources on defeating Germany. However, Admiral King's argument for the Guadalcanal invasion, as well as its successful implementation, convinced Roosevelt that the Pacific Theater could be pursued offensively as well. By the end of 1942, it was clear that Japan had lost the Guadalcanal campaign, a serious blow to Japan's strategic plans for the defense of their empire and an unanticipated defeat at the hands of the Americans.\nPerhaps as important as the military victory for the Allies was the psychological victory. On a level playing field, the Allies had beaten Japan's best land, air, and naval forces. After Guadalcanal, Allied personnel regarded the Japanese military with much less fear and awe than previously. In addition, the Allies viewed the eventual outcome of the Pacific War with greatly increased optimism.\nTokyo Express no longer has terminus on Guadalcanal.\n \u2014Major General Alexander Patch, USA, Commander, U.S. Forces on Guadalcanal\nGuadalcanal is no longer merely a name of an island in Japanese military history. It is the name of the graveyard of the Japanese army.\n\u2014 Major General Kiyotake Kawaguchi, IJA, Commander, 35th Infantry Brigade at Guadalcanal\nBeyond Kawaguchi, several Japanese political and military leaders, including Naoki Hoshino, Nagano, and Torashir\u014d Kawabe, stated shortly after the war that Guadalcanal was the decisive turning point in the conflict. Said Kawabe, \"As for the turning point [of the war], when the positive action ceased or even became negative, it was, I feel, at Guadalcanal.\"\nVilu War Museum and Guadalcanal American Memorial.\nThe Vilu War Museum is on Guadalcanal, about west of Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands. The remains of military equipment and of several aircraft can be seen in the open-air museum. Several memorials for the American, Australian, Fijian, New Zealand and Japanese soldiers who died are erected there.\nTo mark the 50th anniversary of the Red Beach landings, the Guadalcanal American Memorial was dedicated in Honiara on 7 August 1992.\nRemaining ordnance.\nAn unknown amount of unexploded bombs from the battle remain on the island, and residents of the island have been killed or severely injured by unexpected explosions from hidden explosives. The threat to people's lives from unexploded bombs remain high. The Solomon Islands police force has disposed most of the discovered bombs; however, clearance work is expensive, and the island does not have sufficient resources to clear the remaining explosives. The Solomon Islands have urged both the U.S. and Japanese governments to clear the remaining bombs from the island. In 2012, 18 years after the U.S. ended its aid program in the South Pacific, the U.S. provided funds to assist efforts to find and remove unexploded bombs. Australia and Norway also established programs to help the Solomon Islands remove unexploded bombs.\nNews reporting.\nThe Guadalcanal campaign was the subject of a large amount of high-quality reporting. News agencies sent some of their most talented writers, as it was the first major American offensive combat operation of the war. Richard Tregaskis, who wrote for International News Service, gained fame with the publication of his bestselling \"Guadalcanal Diary\" in 1943. Hanson Baldwin, a Navy correspondent, filed stories for \"The New York Times\" and won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the early days of World War II. Tom Yarbrough wrote for the Associated Press, Bob Miller for the United Press, John Hersey for \"Time\" and \"Life\", Ira Wolfert for the North American Newspaper Alliance (his series of articles about the November 1942 Naval Battle of Guadalcanal won him a Pulitzer Prize), Sergeant James Hurlbut for the Marine Corps, and Mack Morriss for \"Yank\" magazine. Commander Vandegrift placed few restrictions on the reporters who were generally allowed to go wherever they wanted and write what they wanted.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nBooks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWeb.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAudio/visual.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60027", "revid": "50663074", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60027", "title": "Battle of Iwo Jima", "text": "Major World War II battle in the Pacific Theater\nThe was a major battle in which the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and United States Navy (USN) landed on and eventually captured the island of Iwo Jima from the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) during World War II. The American invasion, designated Operation Detachment, had the goal of capturing the island with its two airfields: South Field and Central Field.\nThe Japanese Army positions on the island were heavily fortified, with a dense network of bunkers, hidden artillery positions, and of tunnels. American ground forces were supported by extensive naval artillery, and enjoyed complete air supremacy provided by USN and Marine Corps aviators throughout. The five-week battle saw some of the fiercest and bloodiest fighting of the Pacific War.\nUnique among Pacific War battles involving amphibious island landings, total American casualties exceeded those of the Japanese, with a ratio of three American casualties for every two Japanese. Of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on Iwo Jima at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner, some only captured because they had been knocked unconscious or otherwise disabled. Most Japanese were killed in action, but it has been estimated that as many as 3,000 continued to resist within various cave systems on the island after most major fighting ended, until they eventually succumbed to their injuries or surrendered weeks later.\nThe invasion of Iwo Jima was controversial, with retired Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt stating that the island was useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base. The Japanese continued to maintain early-warning radar capabilities on the island of Rota, which was never invaded by American forces. Experiences with previous Pacific island battles suggested that the island would be well-defended and that seizing it would result in significant casualties. Lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for American forces in the Battle of Okinawa two months later and the planned invasion of the Japanese homeland.\nJoe Rosenthal's Associated Press photograph of the raising of the U.S. flag at the summit of the Mount Suribachi by six Marines became a famous image of the battle and the American war in the Pacific.\nBackground.\nAfter the American capture of the Marshall Islands and the air attacks against the Japanese fortress island of Truk Atoll in the Carolines in January 1944, Japanese military leaders reevaluated their strategic position. All indications pointed to an American drive toward the Mariana Islands and the Carolines. To counter such an offensive, the IJA and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) established an inner line of defenses extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, from there to Japan via the Volcano Islands, and westward from the Marianas via the Carolines and the Palau Islands to the Philippines.\nIn March 1944, the Japanese 31st Army, commanded by General Hideyoshi Obata, was activated to garrison this inner line. (Note that an army-sized unit in Imperial Japanese military doctrine was about the size of an American, British Army, or Canadian Army corps.)\nThe commander of the Japanese garrison on Chichi Jima was placed nominally in command of IJA and IJN units in the Volcano Islands. After the American conquest of the Marianas, daily bomber raids from the Marianas began to strike mainland Japan in Operation Scavenger. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station that radioed reports of incoming bombers back to the home islands, allowing Japanese air defenses to prepare for the arrival of American bombers.\nAfter the U.S. seized bases in the Marshall Islands in the battles of Kwajalein and Eniwetok in February 1944, Japanese reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at Yokosuka and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the army garrison on Iwo Jima reached a strength of more than 5,000 men. The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Volcano Islands for the Japanese, who were concerned that the loss of those islands would further facilitate American air raids against the home islands, disrupt war manufacturing, and severely damage civilian morale.\nThe final Japanese plans for the defense of the Volcano Islands were hamstrung by several factors:\nIn a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy used in the defense of Iwo Jima:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground operations on Iwo Island [Jima] toward ultimate victory, it was decided that to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defense, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the suicidal attacks by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our submarines, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.\u2014\u200a\nAfter the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines, the Allies were left with a two-month lull in their offensive operations before the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima was considered strategically important since it provided an air base for Japanese fighter planes to intercept long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers flying to strike targets in Japan. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage intermittent air attacks on the Mariana Islands from November 1944 to January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate those problems. The island's airfield would also support P-51 Mustang fighters, which could escort and protect bombers en route to Japan.\nAmerican intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in one week. In light of optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima, and the operation was codenamed Operation Detachment.\nPlanning and preparation.\nJapanese preparations.\nIn June 1944, Lieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that if the Americans decided to land on Iwo Jima, his garrison could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces so that the United States, and its Australian and British allies, might reconsider carrying out an invasion of the Japanese home islands.\nDrawing inspiration from Japanese defensive tactics used in the Battle of Peleliu, Kuribayashi designed a defensive strategy that broke with traditional Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establishing defenses on the beach to contest the landings directly, he opted for defenses in depth. Kuribayashi's troops constructed a complex system of mutually-supporting fortifications, often linked by a vast tunnel system, equipped with heavy machine guns and artillery. Takeichi Nishi's armored tanks were camouflaged and used as static artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking Mount Suribachi to the rest of the island was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around the mountain as a semi-independent sector, with his main defensive zone built up in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment prompted the creation of an extensive network of tunnels connecting otherwise disparate fighting positions, so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be later reoccupied. This network of bunkers and pillboxes was designed for protracted resistance. For instance, the Nanpo Bunker (Southern Area Islands Naval Air HQ) east of Airfield Number 2, had enough food, water, and ammunition for the Japanese to hold out for three months. The bunker was 90 feet underground with tunnels running in various directions. Approximately five hundred 55-gallon drums filled with water, kerosene, and fuel oil for generators were stored inside the complex. Gasoline-powered generators allowed for radios and lighting to be operated underground.\nBy the time the Americans invaded on 19 February 1945, of a planned of tunnels had been dug. Besides the Nanpo Bunker, there were numerous other command centers and barracks 75 feet below ground. Tunnels allowed for troops to move undetected between defensive positions. Hundreds of hidden artillery and mortar positions were placed all over the island, and many areas extensively mined. Among the Japanese weapons were 320 mm spigot mortars and a variety of explosive rockets. Nonetheless, the Japanese supply situation was inadequate. Troops were supplied 60% of the ammunition normally considered sufficient for single engagement by one division, and food for no more than four months.\nNumerous Japanese sniper nests and camouflaged machine gun positions were set up. Kuribayashi engineered the defenses so that every part of Iwo Jima was subject to Japanese defensive fire. He also received a handful of \"kamikaze\" pilots to use against the enemy fleet; their attacks during the battle killed 318 American sailors. However, against his wishes, Kuribayashi's superiors on Honshu ordered him to erect some beach defenses.\nStarting on 15 June 1944, the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army Air Forces began shore bombardment and air raids against Iwo Jima, which would become the longest and most intense preliminary bombardments in the Pacific Theater. They consisted of a combination of naval artillery attacks and aerial bombings, which would last for nine months. Unaware of Kuribayashi's tunnel defense system, some American planners assumed that most of the Japanese garrison had been killed by the constant bombing raids.\nOn 17 February 1945 the destroyer escort deployed Underwater Demolition Team 15 (UDT-15) onto Iwo Jima's Blue Beach for reconnaissance. They were spotted by Japanese infantry and fired upon, killing one American diver. On the evening of 18 February, \"Blessman\" was hit with a bomb by Japanese aircraft, killing 40 sailors, including 15 members of the UDT.\nPre-landing bombardment.\nMajor General Harry Schmidt, commander of the Marine landing force, requested a 10-day heavy bombardment of the island immediately preceding his planned amphibious assault. However, Rear Admiral William H. P. Blandy, commander of the Amphibious Support Force (Task Force 52), believed that such a bombardment would not allow him time to replenish his ships' ammunition before the landings; he thus refused Schmidt's request. Schmidt then asked for nine days of shelling; Blandy again refused and insisted upon a three-day bombardment. This decision was resented among the Marines in the landing force. After the war, Lieutenant General Holland M. \"Howlin' Mad\" Smith, commander Expeditionary Troops (Task Force 56, which consisted of Schmidt's Fifth Amphibious Corps), bitterly complained that a frequent lack of supporting naval gunfire had cost Marine lives throughout the Allied island-hopping campaign.\nEach heavy warship was assigned an area on Iwo Jima to saturate with shells, ultimately covering the entire island. Each warship fired for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. Poor weather on D-3 (three days before the landings) led to uncertain results for that day's bombardment. On D-2, the time and care that the Japanese had taken in preparing their artillery positions became clear. When heavy cruiser got within range of Japanese shore batteries, the ship was quickly hit six times and suffered 17 dead. Later, 12 small craft attempting to land a UDT were all struck by Japanese fire and quickly retired. While aiding these vessels, the destroyer was also hit and suffered 7 dead. On D-1, Blandy's gunners were once again hampered by rain and clouds. Schmidt summed up his feelings by stating, \"We only got about 13 hours worth of fire support during the 34 hours of available daylight.\"\nThe limited bombardment had a questionable impact on the enemy since the Japanese were heavily dug-in and well fortified. The craters left behind by the barrage also provided additional cover for the defenders, while hampering the attackers' advance. Despite this, many bunkers and caves were destroyed during the bombardment. The Japanese had been preparing for this battle since March 1944, which gave them a significant advantage. By the time of the landing, about 450 American ships were located off Iwo Jima, and the battle ultimately involved about 60,000 U.S. Marines and several thousand U.S. Navy Seabees.\nOpposing forces.\nAmerican.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nJapanese.\n21,060 total men under arms\nLieutenant General Tadamichi Kuribayashi, commanding\nColonel Tadashi Takaishi, chief of staff\n Army\n 109th Division\n Navy\n 4 anti-aircraft defense units\nFirst day \u2013 19 February 1945.\nAmphibious landing.\nDuring the night of 18 February 1945, Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's large carrier force, Task Force 58, arrived off Iwo Jima. Also in this flotilla was Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, the overall commander for the invasion, in his flagship . Smith was once again deeply frustrated that Mitscher's powerful carrier group had been bombing the Japanese home islands instead of softening the defenses of Iwo Jima. Mitscher's fliers did, however, assist the additional surface vessel bombardment that accompanied the launch of the amphibious landing craft toward the island.\nUnlike many days during the three-day preliminary bombardment, D-Day dawned clear and bright. At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first wave of Marines landed on the beaches of the southeastern coast of Iwo Jima. Under Major Howard Connor, 5th Marine Division signal officer, six Navajo code talkers worked around the clock during the first two days of the battle. These six men sent and received over 800 messages, all without error. Connor later stated, \"Were it not for the Navajos, the Marines would never have taken Iwo Jima.\"\nSituation on the beaches.\nUnfortunately for the landing force, the planners at Pearl Harbor severely misjudged the situation that would face Schmidt's Marines. The beaches had been described as \"excellent,\" and the thrust inland expected to be \"easy.\" The apparent lack of a vigorous Japanese response to the landings led the Navy to conclude that its bombardment had effectively suppressed the Japanese defenses. The Marines initially began deployment on the beach in good order, but the landings swiftly became congested due to the loose volcanic ash covering the island. After allowing the Americans to concentrate men and materiel on the beach for just over an hour, throughout which they maintained cohesive fire discipline, the Japanese opened fire. Shortly after 10:00 machine guns, mortars, and heavy artillery began to rain down on the crowded beach.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At first it came as a ragged rattle of machine-gun bullets, growing gradually louder and fiercer until at last all the pent-up fury of a hundred hurricanes seemed to be breaking upon the heads of the Americans. Shells screeched and crashed, every hummock spat automatic fire and the very soil underfoot erupted with hundreds of exploding land mines\u00a0... Marines walking erect crumpled and fell. Concussion lifted them and slammed them down, or tore them apart\u00a0...Furthermore, after crossing the beach, the Marines were faced with slopes of soft black volcanic ash. This ash allowed for neither secure footing nor the construction of foxholes to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb some of the fragments from Japanese artillery.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Marines were trained to move rapidly forward; here they could only plod. The weight and amount of equipment was a terrific hindrance and various items were rapidly discarded. First to go was the gas mask\u00a0...\nThe Japanese crews manning the heavy artillery in Mount Suribachi opened reinforced steel doors shielding their positions in order to fire, and then closed them immediately afterward to prevent counterfire from the Marines and USN gunners. This made it exceedingly difficult for American units to destroy a Japanese artillery piece. To make matters worse for the Americans, most bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system running through most of the island. Bunkers cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were often reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving underground. This tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.\n\"Time-Life\" correspondent Robert Sherrod described the landing simply as \"a nightmare in hell.\"\nMoving off the beaches.\nAmtracs, unable to gain traction in the black ash, made no progress up the slopes dominating the beach; their Marine passengers had to dismount and slog forward on foot. Men of Naval Construction Battalions 31 and 133, braving enemy fire, were eventually able to bulldoze roads off of the beach. This allowed the Marines to finally make some progress inland and get off the beach, which had become overcrowded with both men and materiel as follow-on waves of landing craft continued to unload. Casualties on the beach were heavy, with historian Derrick Wright noting \"in virtually every shell hole there lay at least one dead Marine.\"\nBy 11:30, some Marines had managed to reach the southern tip of Airfield No. 1, the seizure of which had been one of the original objectives for the first day. They repelled a fanatical charge by over 100 Japanese troops and were able to keep their toehold on Airfield No. 1 as night fell.\nCrossing the island.\nIn the left-most sector of the landings, the Americans did manage to achieve one of their objectives for the battle that day. Led by Colonel Harry B. \"Harry the Horse\" Liversedge, the 28th Marines drove across the island at its narrowest width, around , thereby isolating the Japanese dug in on Mount Suribachi.\nAction on the right flank.\nThe rightmost landing area was dominated by Japanese fortifications located at \"the Quarry\". The 25th Marine Regiment conducted a two-pronged attack to neutralize this position. 2nd Lieutenant Benjamin Roselle, part of a ground team directing naval gunfire, described the following experience:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Within a minute a mortar shell exploded among the group\u00a0... his left foot and ankle hung from his leg, held on by a ribbon of flesh\u00a0... Within minutes a second round landed near him and fragments tore into his other leg. For nearly an hour he wondered where the next shell would land. He was soon to find out as a shell burst almost on top of him, wounding him for the third time in the shoulder. Almost at once another explosion bounced him several feet into the air and hot shards ripped into both thighs\u00a0... as he lifted his arm to look at his watch a mortar shell exploded only feet away and blasted the watch from his wrist and tore a large jagged hole in his forearm: \"I was beginning to know what it must be like to be crucified,\" he was later to say.\nThe 25th Marines' 3rd Battalion had landed approximately 900 men on the island that morning. Japanese resistance at the Quarry was so fierce that by nightfall, only 150 Marines were left in fighting condition, an 83.3% casualty rate.\nBy the evening of 19 February, 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow. Aboard the command ship USS \"Eldorado\", Smith saw the lengthy casualty reports and was briefed on the slow progress of the ground forces. To the war correspondents covering the operation, Smith remarked: \"I don't know who he is, but the Japanese general running this show is one smart bastard.\"\nSubsequent combat.\nIn the days after the landings, the Marines expected the usual Japanese \"banzai\" charge during the night. This had been the standard Japanese defense strategy in previous island battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific, such as the Battle of Saipan in June 1944. In those attacks, for which the Marines had usually been at least somewhat prepared, the majority of Japanese attackers had been killed and the overall Japanese fighting strength significantly degraded. However, General Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden these \"human wave\" attacks, considering them a futile waste of resources.\nThe fighting near the beachhead remained intense, and the American advance was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery. Marines were frequently ambushed by Japanese troops who sprang out of previously-unseen tunnels. At night, the Japanese left their defenses in small groups to attack American foxholes under cover of darkness, and USN ships began firing star shells to illuminate the battlefield. Similar to previous battles on Japanese-held islands, Japanese soldiers who knew English were used to harass and deceive Marine units. English-speaking IJA troops often yelled \"corpsman\", pretending to be a wounded Marine, in order to lure and kill the USN medical personnel attached to Marine infantry companies.\nThe Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders, and turned to flamethrowers and grenades to flush the Japanese troops out of their tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight Sherman M4A3R3 medium tanks equipped with a flamethrower (\"Ronson\" or \"Zippo\" tanks), proved highly effective at clearing hardened Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, often requiring Japanese defenders to assault them in the open, where they were vulnerable to the superior numbers and firepower of the Marines.\nClose air support was initially provided by fighters from escort carriers off the coast. This shifted over to the 15th Fighter Group, flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares), used to light up the battlefield at night, were initially provided by ships but were later provided by land-based artillery. Navajo code talkers were part of the American ground communications system, along with walkie-talkies and SCR-610 backpack radio sets.\nAfter running out of water, food and most other supplies, Japanese troops became desperate toward the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks for most of the fighting, realized defeat was imminent.\nMarines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine-gun fire and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks. Once the landing area was secured, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore, and the Americans proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.\nRaising the flag on Mount Suribachi.\n\"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" is a black and white photograph taken by Joe Rosenthal depicting six Marines from E Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, raising a U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi on 23 February 1945, the second of two flag-raisings on the site that day. The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its publication, becoming one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time. The image was later used by Felix de Weldon to sculpt the 1954 Marine Corps War Memorial located adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery.\nThree of the six Marines depicted in the photograph, Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley, were killed in action days after the flag-raising. Surviving flag-raiser Private First Class Ira Hayes, together with Private First Class Rene Gagnon and Navy hospital corpsman Pharmacist's Mate Second Class John Bradley, became celebrities upon their participation in a war bond selling tour after the battle. Three subsequent Marine Corps investigations into the identities of the six men in the photograph determined: in 1946 and 1947, that Harlon Block was incorrectly identified as Henry Hansen (both killed six days after the photo was taken); in May and June 2016, that John Bradley was not in the photograph and Private First Class Harold Schultz was; and in 2019, that Rene Gagnon was not in the photograph and Private First Class Harold Keller was.\nBy the morning of 23 February, Mount Suribachi was effectively cut off above ground from the rest of the island. The Marines knew there was an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two small patrols from two rifle companies of the 2/28 Marines were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. The recon patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting all enemy contacts to the 2/28 Marines commander, Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson.\nPopular accounts published by the press in the aftermath of the release of the photo of the flag raising had the Marines fighting all the way up to the summit. Although the riflemen expected an ambush, the larger patrol going up afterwards encountered only a few defenders once on top and after the flag was raised. The majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network during shelling, only occasionally attacking in small groups, and were generally all killed.\nJohnson called for a reinforced platoon-size patrol from E Company to climb Suribachi and seize and occupy the crest. The patrol commander, First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, was handed the battalion's American flag to be raised on top to signal Suribachi's capture, if they reached the summit. Johnson and the Marines anticipated heavy fighting, but the patrol encountered only a small amount of sniper fire on the way up the mountain. After the mountain top was secured by Schrier and his men, a length of Japanese water pipe was found among the wreckage; the American flag was attached to the pipe, then raised and planted atop Mount Suribachi, the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil. Photographs of the flag and some of the patrol members around it were taken by Marine photographer Louis R. Lowery, the only photographer who had accompanied Schrier's patrol up the mountain.\nAs the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Johnson believed that the flag belonged to the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, who had captured that section of the island. In the early afternoon, Johnson sent Gagnon, a runner (messenger) from his battalion for E Company, to take a larger flag up the volcano to replace the smaller and less visible flag. The replacement flag was attached to a heavier section of water pipe, and six Marines proceeded to raise it into place as the smaller flag was taken down and delivered to the battalion's headquarters down below. It was during this \"second\" flag-raising that Rosenthal took the iconic photograph \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\". The second flag flew on Mount Suribachi until it was taken down on 14 March, when, at the same time, an American flag was officially raised during a ceremony at the V Amphibious Corps command post near Mount Suribachi. The official flag raising was ordered by General Holland Smith and attended by General Erskine and some members of the 3rd Marine Division.\nNorthern Iwo Jima.\nDespite the loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi, which was much more vulnerable to naval artillery fire. The fortifications on the northern section of Iwo Jima were also more impressive than those at the southern end of the island. Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. There were also about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry available for combat. The most arduous task left to the Marines was seizing the Motoyama Plateau, with its distinctive Hill 382 and \"Turkey knob\", as well as the area in between, referred to as \"the Amphitheater\". These obstacles formed the basis of what came to be known to the Marines as the \"meatgrinder\". While these Japanese positions were being reduced on the right flank, American units on the left were clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty.\nThe Marines' overall objective at this point was to take control of Airfield No. 2 in the center of the island. However, every \"penetration seemed to become a disaster\" as \"units were raked from the flanks, chewed up, and sometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines\". As a result, the fighting bogged down, and American casualties piled up rapidly. Even capturing these points did not guarantee that the captured territory was secure, since a previously cleared fortification could be reoccupied by Japanese troops utilizing the island's tunnel system. As such, it was said that \"[the Marines] could take these heights at will, and then regret it\".\nAmerican troops observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in caves, only to reemerge when Marine units began to advance and lay down devastating fire on them. Over time, the Japanese learned basic American combat tactics, which usually involved laying down a heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, Erskine ordered the 9th Marine Regiment to attack under cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage. This was a resounding success, with many Japanese soldiers killed while still asleep. This became a key moment in the capture of Hill 362. The hill held such strategic importance that the Japanese organized a counterattack to retake it the following night. Although Kuribayashi had forbidden the massed infantry charges often used by the Japanese in previous battles in the Pacific, the local IJA commander of the area decided on a \"banzai\" charge with the optimistic goal of recapturing Mount Suribachi.\nOn the evening of 8 March, Captain Samaji Inouye and his 1,000 men charged the American lines, inflicting 347 casualties (90 deaths). The Marines counted 784 dead Japanese soldiers the next day. The same day, elements of the 3rd Marine Division reached the northern coast of the island, splitting Kuribayashi's defenses in two. There was also a \"kamikaze\" air attack (the only one of the battle) on the ships anchored at sea on 21 February, which resulted in the sinking of the escort carrier , severe damage to , and slight damage to the escort carrier , an LST, and a transport.\nAlthough the island was declared secure at 18:00 on 16 March (25 days after the landings), the 5th Marine Division still faced Kuribayashi's main stronghold, located in a gorge long at the northwestern end of the island. On 21 March, the Marines destroyed the command post in the gorge with four tons of explosives, and on 24 March Marines sealed the remaining caves at the northern tip of the island. However, on the night of 25 March, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final counterattack in the vicinity of Airfield No. 2. Army pilots, Seabees, and Marines of the 5th Pioneer Battalion and 28th Marines fought the Japanese force for up to 90 minutes, suffering heavy casualties (53 killed, 120 wounded). Although still a matter of speculation due to conflicting accounts from surviving Japanese veterans, it is possible that Kuribayashi personally led this final assault, which \u2013 unlike the loud \"banzai\" charge of previous battles \u2013 was conducted in silence by the Japanese infantrymen. If he did participate in this assault, Kuribayashi would have been the highest ranking Japanese officer to have personally led an attack during World War II. Additionally, this would also be a departure from the normal practice of commanding Japanese officers committing seppuku behind the lines while their subordinates perished in a last-ditch \"banzai\" charge, as occurred during the battles of Saipan and Okinawa. The island was officially declared secure at 09:00 on 26 March.\nOnce the island was officially declared secure, the U.S. Army's 147th Infantry Regiment was ostensibly there to act as a garrison force, but soon found itself locked in a bitter struggle against thousands of Japanese holdouts engaging in a guerrilla campaign to harass the Americans. Utilizing caves and tunnel systems, the remnants of the Japanese garrison conducted numerous attacks on American forces. For three months, the 147th slogged across the island, using flamethrowers, grenades, and satchel charges to dig out the enemy, ultimately killing some 1,602 Japanese soldiers in small unit actions (along with many others who died in sealed caves) while suffering fifteen men killed in action and another 144 wounded. The Ohioans were also credited with capturing 867 Japanese soldiers; combined with the number of enemy soldiers killed by the regiment, this casualty figure represented over 10% of the original Japanese garrison.\nFlamethrowers.\nThe United States M2 flamethrower was heavily used in the Pacific. It features two tanks containing fuel and one of compressed gas, which are combined and ignited to produce a stream of flaming liquid out of the tip.\nFlamethrowers were used to kill Japanese inside pillboxes, buildings and caves. A battalion would assign one flamethrower per platoon with one reserve flamethrower in each group. Flamethrower operators were usually in more danger than regular troops as the short range of their weapon required close combat, and the visibility of the flames on the battlefield made them a prominent target for snipers. Still, they were essential to breaking the dug-in enemy.\nFor better protection, flamethrowers were mounted on flame tanks, and one battalion commander called these the \"best single weapon of the operation.\" Prior to Saipan the Marine Corps had left flamethrowing tank development to the Army. They had placed an order with the Army for nine tanks per division. At Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, Colonel Unmacht's top secret \"Flame Thrower Group\" located eight M4A3 Sherman medium tanks to convert for Operation Detachment. His Seabees, from the 117th CB, worked to combine the best features of three different flame units, the Ronson, the Navy model I and the Navy Mk-1, which soon led to the far better CB-H2. The U.S. Army Chemical Corps variously identified these tanks as POA-CWS-H1, (Pacific Ocean Area-Chemical Warfare Section-Hawaii) CWS-POA-H2, CWS-POA-H1 H2, OR CWS-\"75\"-H1 H2 mechanized flamethrowers. U.S. Marine and U.S. Army observer documents from Iwo Jima refer to them as the CB-Mk-1 or CB-H1. Marines on the lines simply called them the Mark I. The official USMC designation was \"M4 A3R5\". The Japanese referred to them as M1 tanks, and it is speculated that they did so because of a poor translation of \"MH-1\".\nOn Iwo Jima the flame tanks all landed on D-Day and went into action on D+2, sparingly at first. As the battle progressed, portable flame units wielded on foot sustained casualty rates up to 92%, leaving few troops trained to use the weapon. More and more calls came for the Mark-1 flame tanks, to the point that the Marines became dependent upon them and would hold up their assault until a flame tank was available. Since each tank battalion had only four, they were pooled among units and would dispatch from their respective refueling locations as the battle progressed. Towards the end of the battle, 5th Marine tanks expended between of napalm per day.\nNavajo Code Talkers.\nNavajo code talkers were a vital part of the U.S. Pacific campaign, and especially in the Battle of Iwo Jima. \"Before the War Navajo boys were sent to a boarding school where Indians were taught to read, write and speak English. If they were caught speaking Navajo they would be punished. \"This caused the United States to almost lose one of its secret weapons. When Pearl Harbor happened in 1941 \"The United States had been caught unprepared. In addition to being out-manned, outgunned and outsmarted in the early days of the war, the U.S. was also out-coded, as the Japanese forces had broken the coding system of the Pacific fleet.\" \nThis prompted the U.S. armed forces to search for new sources for codes. In 1942, Sergeant Phillip Johnson was assigned to direct the code training of Platoon 382 made up of Navajo men. \"They were trained in sending and receiving messages from air to ground, ship to shore, tank to command post. Messages included missions and maneuvers, location and strength of the enemy, time and place of attack and other tactical orders.\" While on the Island of Iwo Jima, \"Code Talkers acted as forward observers, calling in artillery strikes against positions that were causing the Marines problems. Code Talkers on land would radio positions to a command ship offshore, their messages then given to admirals and generals. A new strike plan would be drawn then the information transmitted back onto the shore all without being tapped by the Japanese, to whom such information would have proven decisive\" \"By the end of the battle, Billison and other Code Talkers had transmitted more than 800 messages error-free.\" These messages would be important information like new plans, or artillery barrages from the Navy Ships. Overall, the Navajo Code Talkers played a significant part in the U.S. success in the Pacific and Iwo Jima. There were only 28 non-Navajos who could speak the language, none of whom were German or Japanese. The Navajo language is challenging for speakers of European or East Asian languages to learn; and even if learned, it would be hard to imitate a native speaker. Japanese forces tried to bribe the Navajo to decipher the code, but they remained loyal to the United States.\nAftermath.\nJapanese holdouts on the island, including two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's men, and , lasted four years without being caught, and finally surrendered on 6 January 1949.\nThe American victory at Iwo Jima had been extremely costly. According to the Navy Department Library, \"the 36-day assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.\" By comparison, the much larger-scale 82-day Battle of Okinawa lasting from early April until mid-June 1945 (involving five U.S. Army and two Marine Corps divisions) resulted in over 62,000 U.S. casualties, of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing. Iwo Jima was also the only U.S. Marine battle where the American casualties exceeded those of the Japanese, although Japanese combat deaths numbered three times as many as American KIA. Two U.S. Marines were captured during the battle, neither of whom survived their captivity.\nThe was sunk during the battle, the last U.S. aircraft carrier sunk in World War II. 20 Grumman FM-2 Wildcat fighters and 11 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers went down with \"Bismarck Sea\". The was so severely damaged that she took no part in either combat or transportation duties for the rest of the war, and became a training ship for night fighter operations. 31 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and nine Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers were destroyed by the kamikaze attack on \"Saratoga\" along with the loss of 132 men. Because all civilians had been evacuated, there were no civilian casualties on Iwo Jima, unlike at Saipan and Okinawa.\nStrategic importance.\nIn hindsight, given the number of casualties, the necessity and long-term significance of the island's capture to the outcome of the war became a contentious issue and remains disputed. The Marines, who conducted the landings and suffered the vast majority of the casualties, had not been consulted in the planning of the operation. As early as April 1945, retired Chief of Naval Operations William V. Pratt stated in \"Newsweek\" magazine that the \"expenditure of manpower to acquire a small, God-forsaken island, useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base\u00a0... [one] wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost.\"\nThe lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the Battle of Okinawa in April 1945, and influenced American planning for an invasion of the Japanese home islands. For example, on Okinawa, \"because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day, it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island\". Additionally, in the planning for a potential invasion of Japan itself, it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima, and later again at Okinawa, had been killed or wounded.\nThe justification behind Iwo Jima's strategic importance to the United States' war effort revolves around the island's role as a landing and refueling site for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts ultimately proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were flown from Iwo Jima. By the time Iwo Jima had been captured, the bombing campaign against Japan had switched from daylight precision bombing to nighttime incendiary attacks, so fighter escorts were of limited utility.\nJapanese fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima occasionally attacked U.S. Army Air Force bombers, which were vulnerable en route to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel. However, the impact of Iwo Jima-based Japanese interceptors on the American bombing effort was marginal; in the three months before the invasion, only 11 B-29s had been lost to Japanese aircraft flying out of the Bonin Islands. The Superfortresses largely found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island. Capturing the island neutralized Japanese air attacks on the Marianas, but these attacks were too small to ever seriously threaten American military assets based on Saipan and Tinian.\nThe Japanese garrison on Iwo Jima possessed radar and was thus able to notify air defenses on the home islands of incoming B-29 Superfortresses flying from the Marianas. However, the capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early-warning radar system, which continued to receive information on incoming B-29s from the island of Rota (which was never invaded).\nAs early as 4 March 1945, while fighting was still taking place, the B-29 \"Dinah Might\" of the USAAF 9th Bomb Group reported it was low on fuel near the island and requested an emergency landing. Despite enemy fire, the airplane landed on the Allied-controlled section of the island (South Field) without incident and was serviced, refueled and departed.\nIn all, 2,251 B-29 landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war. Author J. Robert Moskin records that 1,191 fighter escorts and 3,081 strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan. A more recent Air Force study found the contribution of VII Fighter Command, based on Iwo Jima, to be superfluous. Another rationale for capturing the island was to provide a base for shorter-range B-24 Liberator bombers against Japan, but no significant B-24 bombing campaign ever materialized.\nSome downed B-29 crewmen were saved by air-sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island, but Iwo Jima was just one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose. As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers, Marine Captain Robert Burrell, then a history instructor at the United States Naval Academy, suggested that only a small proportion of the 2,251 landings were for genuine emergencies, with the vast majority possibly being for minor technical checkups, training, or refueling. According to Burrell,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This justification became prominent only after the Marines seized the island and incurred high casualties. The tragic cost of Operation Detachment pressured veterans, journalists, and commanders to fixate on the most visible rationalization for the battle. The sight of the enormous, costly, and technologically sophisticated B-29 landing on the island's small airfield most clearly linked Iwo Jima to the strategic bombing campaign. As the myths about the flag raisings on Mount Suribachi reached legendary proportions, so did the emergency landing theory in order to justify the need to raise that flag.\nThe \"emergency landing\" thesis counts every B-29 landing on Iwo Jima as an emergency and asserts that capturing the island saved the lives of the nearly 25,000 crewmen of all 2,251 planes (2,148 B-29 crewmen were killed in combat during the entire war in all theaters). However, of the nearly 2,000 B-29s which landed from May\u2013July 1945, more than 80% were for routine refueling. Several hundred landings were made for training purposes, and most of the remainder were for relatively minor engine maintenance. During June 1945, which saw the largest number of landings, none of the more than 800 B-29s that landed on the island did so because of combat damage. Of the aircraft that would have been lost without being able to land, air-sea rescue figures indicate that 50% of crewmen who ditched at sea survived, so even if Iwo Jima had not been taken the estimate of the supposedly potential 25,000 dead crewmen from airplanes crashing into the ocean should be dwindled down to 12,500. \nAccording to Robert S. Burrell, author of \"The Ghosts of Iwo Jima\", the very losses formed the basis for a \"reverence for the Marine Corps\" that not only embodied the \"American national spirit\" but ensured the \"institutional survival\" of the Marine Corps.\nNaval vessels badly damaged.\nThe following table lists for each ship badly damaged in the Battle of Iwo Jima, the dates they received hits, the cause, the type of ship, and the casualties inflicted during 17\u201328 February. The carrier , which received light damage, was listed because of the importance of escort carriers in the battle.\nMedal of Honor recipients.\nThe Medal of Honor is the highest military decoration awarded by the United States government. It is bestowed on a member of the United States Armed Forces who distinguishes himself by \"...\u00a0conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States\u00a0...\" Because of its nature, the medal is commonly awarded posthumously.\nThe Medal of Honor was awarded to 22 Marines (12 posthumously), and five were presented to sailors, four of whom were hospital corpsmen (two posthumously) attached to Marine infantry units. The medals awarded for the battle accounted for 28% of the 82 awarded to Marines in World War II.\nAt the time of his death on 29 June 2022, Marine Hershel W. Williams was the last living Medal of Honor recipient from World War II. He received his medal for actions in the Battle of Iwo Jima.\nLegacy.\nThe Marine Corps Iwo Jima Memorial was dedicated on 10 November 1954 at Arlington National Cemetery.\nThe USN has commissioned two ships with the name (1961\u20131993) and (2001\u2013present).\nThe first large-scale reunion on the island was held in 1970 on the 25th anniversary of the battle. The event was sponsored by the Fifth Marine Division Association and included both American and Japanese veterans of the battle. Other notable attendees included then Brigadier General William K. Jones commander of the 3rd Marine Division and NBC\u2019s senior correspondent in Asia John Rich. The widows of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi and Colonel Takeichi Nishi also attended events with American veterans held in Tokyo.\nOn 19 February 1985, the 40th anniversary of the landings on Iwo Jima, an event called the \"Reunion of Honor\" was held (the event has been held annually since 2002). Veterans of both sides of the battle attended the event, which is sited on the beach where U.S. forces landed. A memorial on which inscriptions were engraved by both sides was built at the center of the meeting place. Japanese attended at the mountain side, where the Japanese inscription was carved, and Americans attended at the shore side, where the English inscription was carved. After unveiling and offering of flowers were made, the representatives of both countries approached the memorial; upon meeting, they shook hands. The combined Japan-U.S. memorial service of the 50th anniversary of the battle was held in front of the monument in February 1995. Further memorial services have been held on later anniversaries.\nThe importance of the battle to Marines today is demonstrated in pilgrimages made to the island, and specifically the summit of Suribachi. Marines will often leave dog tags, rank insignia, or other tokens at the monuments in homage. Iwo Jima Day is observed annually on 19 February in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts with a ceremony at the State House.\nThe Japanese government continues to search for and retrieve the remains of Japanese military personnel who were killed during the battle.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek, one of the oldest dioceses in Poland, since the 12th century, with the landmark Gothic W\u0142oc\u0142awek Cathedral listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. Poland's largest hydroelectric power plant is also located there.\nHistory.\nW\u0142oc\u0142awek's history dates back to the late Bronze Age \u2013 early Iron Age (1300 BCE \u2013 500 BCE). Archaeological excavations conducted on the current city site uncovered the remains of a settlement belonging to the Lusatian culture, as well as evidence of a settlement of early Pomeranian culture which had been established. Traces of additional settlements dating to the Roman period and the early Middle Ages have also been excavated in the area.\nMiddle Ages.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe settlement was founded in the 9th century and its early inhabitants were occupied with agriculture and crafts. In the 10th century it became part of the emerging Polish state under the Piast dynasty. Already under the rule of Boles\u0142aw I the Brave it was one of Poland's most important administrative centers, as mentioned in the \"Gesta principum Polonorum\" chronicle from the 1110s, which also happens to be the oldest known mention of the city. The name is derived from the Old Polish male name W\u0142odzis\u0142aw, possibly the founder of W\u0142oc\u0142awek. In the mid-10th century, under Casimir I the Restorer, W\u0142oc\u0142awek was the seat of a castellany and the administrative center of Kuyavia.\nOne of the earliest references to the town came from an assistant to the Archbishop of Gniezno who was noted as residing in the town in 1123. Later the Diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek () of Kuyavia in 1148, notates its existence in a bull issued by Pope Eugene III, while mentioning the first bishop of W\u0142oc\u0142awek as Warner. Warner was followed by an Italian, Onoldius; the diocese was recorded as \"W\u0142oc\u0142awek and Pomerania\" (\"Vladislaviensis et Pomeraniae\").\nIn the 12th century, there was a mint and a customs chamber, where tolls were collected from ships and boats sailing on the Vistula and Zg\u0142owi\u0105czka rivers. A hospital was founded at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries, whereas the local school was first mentioned in 1215.\nW\u0142oc\u0142awek received its city rights in 1255. During the 14th and 15th centuries, the city was destroyed and captured several times by the Teutonic Knights and renamed it Leslau. The Treaty of Thorn, signed in 1411, resulted in short-lived peace for the city, however, it prospered from its involvement in the ransoming of the captured Teutonic Knights which was payable in three instalments and proved to be a hardship on the Prussian faction. W\u0142oc\u0142awek was located within the Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski Voivodeship of the Greater Poland Province. There is a possibility that Nicolaus Copernicus, the later renowned astronomer, may have attended the local cathedral school in the late 15th century.\nModern era.\nThe city's prosperity came from river transport of grain from Kuyavia, the collection of tolls on grain floated from the more southern part of Poland to the country's main port of Gda\u0144sk, transport of timber from the Narew, Bug and upper Vistula rivers for export to Western Europe and brewing. This is mentioned in the 1595 poem \"Flis, to jest Spuszczanie statk\u00f3w Wis\u0142\u0105 i inszymi rzekami do niej przypadaj\u0105cymi\" by Sebastian Klonowic.\nIn 1569, Bishop Stanis\u0142aw Karnkowski founded a theological seminary in W\u0142oc\u0142awek, one of the oldest seminaries in Poland. In 1625, the Reformed Franciscans were brought to W\u0142oc\u0142awek by Bishop Andrzej Lipski, and soon their Baroque monastery was built.\nThe city was ravaged by the Swedes during the Swedish invasion of Poland in 1657 and by the Russians during the Great Northern War in 1707. In 1790, Polish national hero Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko stayed in W\u0142oc\u0142awek.\nAfter the Second Partition of Poland of 1793, W\u0142oc\u0142awek became part of Prussia. It was the site of Polish resistance during the Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising of 1794, when Dionizy Mniewski sank Prussian ships with ammunition headed for besieged Warsaw. After the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807 it became part of the Polish short-lived Duchy of Warsaw. Subsequently, after the Congress of Vienna it became part of Congress Kingdom of Poland in the Russian Partition of Poland in 1815. Polish insurgents operated in the city and in its vicinity during the January Uprising of 1863\u20131864. The insurgents clashed with Russian troops in W\u0142oc\u0142awek on November 8, 1863, and February 17, 1864. The oldest Polish theological journal \"Ateneum Kap\u0142a\u0144skie\" has been published in W\u0142oc\u0142awek since 1909. The city was again destroyed during the battles of German offensive during the First World War.\nWhen Poland declared independence in 1918, local Poles disarmed the Germans and liberated the city. In 1920, Poles successfully defended the city against the invading Soviets during the Polish\u2013Soviet War.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, W\u0142oc\u0142awek was occupied by German troops, which entered the city on 14 September 1939. Under the Nazi German occupation W\u0142oc\u0142awek was again renamed Leslau, annexed by decree to the German Reich on 8 October 1939 and administered from 26 October as a part of Reichsgau Posen (renamed on 29 January 1940 Reichsgau Wartheland).\nAlready in September 1939, Germans committed a massacre of a group of local Jews and burned both synagogues. The \"Einsatzgruppe III\" entered the city between September 23 and October 5, 1939, and afterwards carried out mass arrests of local Poles in October and November as part of the \"Intelligenzaktion\". Dozens of Catholic priests from W\u0142oc\u0142awek, including Auxiliary Bishop of W\u0142oc\u0142awek Micha\u0142 Kozal, and lecturers and students of the seminary were arrested, and then deported in January 1940 to the Dachau concentration camp, where most of them were killed. Rector of the local seminary Henryk Kaczorowski and two students Bronis\u0142aw Kostkowski and Tadeusz Dulny are now considered three of the 108 Blessed Polish Martyrs of World War II by the Catholic Church. Local teachers were arrested in October 1939, and then deported to concentration camps and murdered. In late 1939, the \"SS\" and \"Selbstschutz\" burnt down the Grzywno district and murdered many of its inhabitants in the nearby village of Warz\u0105chewka Polska. Poles from W\u0142oc\u0142awek were also massacred in the nearby village of Pi\u0144czata. Arrested Polish teachers, landowners and priests from the W\u0142oc\u0142awek and Lipno counties were also imprisoned in W\u0142oc\u0142awek, and some were later also deported to concentration camps and murdered.\nFamilies of deported and murdered Poles, as well as the remaining residents of Grzywno were expelled to the so-called General Government in late 1939, and in 1940 also owners of shops, workshops and bigger houses were expelled, so their properties could be handed over to German colonists as part of the \"Lebensraum\" policy. The Germans also robbed the precious historical collections of the Diocese of W\u0142oc\u0142awek and the Baroque Franciscan monastery and closed down the cathedral. The city's central square, \"Plac Wolno\u015bci\" (\"Liberty Square\"), was renamed \"Adolf-Hitler-Platz\" by the Germans. By the time the war ended, nearly the entire Jewish population of more than 10,000 had been murdered.\nW\u0142oc\u0142awek was captured on 20 January 1945 by Soviet troops of the 1st Belorussian Front during the Vistula\u2013Oder Offensive. From February to April 1945, the Russians looted local factories and enterprises of grain (over 200 tons), coal (over 50 tons), fuel, machinery, cars, spirits, office equipment, which were taken en masse to the Soviet Union. Mass Soviet requisitions in the county caused food shortages in W\u0142oc\u0142awek. One third of the city was destroyed, but its factories and workshops were rebuilt by the Polish government in the following decades.\nRecent period.\nThe most important industries in W\u0142oc\u0142awek today are chemical industry, production of furniture, and food processing. The dam which was constructed in 1969 regulates the water level of the Vistula river, forming W\u0142oc\u0142awek Reservoir. From 1975 to 1999, the city was the capital of the W\u0142oc\u0142awek Voivodeship.\nThe Catholic priest Fr. (now Blessed), Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko, who was associated with the workers' and trade union movement Solidarity, and who was also a member of the opposition to the Communist regime in Poland, was tortured and murdered by three Security Police officers, and was thrown into the W\u0142oc\u0142awek Reservoir, close to the city. His body was recovered from the reservoir on 30 October 1984.\nFrom 2012 the city is part of the Special Economic Zone - W\u0142oc\u0142awek Economic Development Area \u2013 Industrial and Technological Park with tax-free areas and incentives for investors.\nThe Jewish Community in W\u0142oc\u0142awek.\nThe Jewish population increased from 218 (6.6%) in 1820 to 6,919 in 1910 (20.5%) and 13,500 in 1939. One of the founders of the Mizrac\u1e25i movement, rabbi Leib Kowalski (1895\u20131925), lived and worked in W\u0142oc\u0142awek. During the interbellum period, the town had several Jewish schools (primary and high schools), two yeshivas, and three Jewish sports clubs.\nWith the beginning of the German occupation of Poland, W\u0142oc\u0142awek became the first town in Europe in which Jews were required to wear distinctive yellow badges. Murders of Jews began in 1939 and the W\u0142oc\u0142awek ghetto was created in November 1940. The Nazis deported 3,000 of W\u0142oc\u0142awek's Jews to ghettos and labor camps between December 1939 and June 1941. Some 2,000 Jews were deported to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and then to the Che\u0142mno extermination camp between 26 and 30 September 1941. The ghetto was burnt in late April 1942 after the remaining Jews were sent to Chelmno where they were immediately gassed. Most of the Jews sent to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto died of starvation or illness, and many were sent to Auschwitz from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a.\nAfter the war nearly 1000 Jews returned to W\u0142oc\u0142awek and re-established their community. However, Jews left after disputes within the community itself, and the desire of most Jews not to live under Communism, installed by the Soviets. By the late 1960s, the community had disappeared.\nToday there is only very little, if any trace at all, of their once rich and lively community. There is a table for victims of Jewish ghetto in W\u0142oc\u0142awek's Rakut\u00f3wek neighborhood (Polish Tablica Ofiar Getta we W\u0142oc\u0142awku) and Jewish Cemetery at Municipal/Communal Cemetery (Polish Cmentarz Komunalny we W\u0142oc\u0142awku).\n Tombstone of Piotr from Bnin, sculpted by Veit Stoss - 1493, \n Chapter house - 1521\n Renaissance chapel - 1604-1611\n Gothic stained glass windows - 1360, the oldest ones in Poland\n Tombstone of Marcin Talibowski - 1493 \n Painting by Francisco de Zurbar\u00e1n - 17th century\n The Tumski Crucifix\n The largest painting on a single board in Poland - 1470\n Stained glass windows by J\u00f3zef Mehoffer\n Sculpture, The Last Supper - 1505 \n Painting by Juan Correa de Vivar - 1565\n Eucharistic Throne \u2013 one of the most magnificent silver masterpieces in Europe - 1744\n Candelabrum by Hans Meyer - 1596\nMuseums.\nNext to Basilica Cathedral there is the Diocesan Museum (Polish Muzeum Diecezjalne) with paintings by Guercino, and prints by Albrecht D\u00fcrer. The Seminary Library of Chodynski Brothers keeps precious manuscripts, including missals from 1500.\nIt hosts two permanent exhibitions: \"W\u0142oc\u0142awek`s Faience\" and \"The Gallery of Polish portraits\" with works by J\u00f3zef Simmler, Teodor Axentowicz (neoclassicism); Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski (impressionism); Jacek Malczewski and Vlastimil Hofman (symbolism), J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz, Wojciech Kossak, Alfons Karpi\u0144ski, Olga Bozna\u0144ska (1920s and 1930s), Anthony van Dyck or Marcello Bacciarelli.\nThe museum is located in a historic granary and hosts an exhibition by Franciszek Tournelle. It showcases the most important elements of folk culture and equipment of house interior and farm of Kuyavia: farming, breeding, fishing, pottery, blacksmithing, cart-wrighting, cooperage, plaiting, historic folk sculpture, shrovetide customs, and musical instruments.\nThe museum consists of two historic Baroque houses from the 16th and 18th century on the Old Market. They exhibit artefacts connected with the history of W\u0142oc\u0142awek and Poland from archaeological excavations to Liberation of W\u0142oc\u0142awek in 1945 including the Bowl of W\u0142oc\u0142awek (10th century) and elements of knights armour (14th and 15th century), objects related to the economic life of W\u0142oc\u0142awek (16th and 17th century), measures and weights, treasures with coins from the 12th to 18th centuries, pharmaceutics from the 19th and 20th centuries, memorabilia of big industry in the 19th century, memorabilia of the Fire Department, sports trophies, uniforms, firearms, weapons, photographs and the archives of national uprisings, Polish-Soviet War (1919\u20131921), interwar decades, and World War I and World War II, models of non-existent buildings (city hall, St. Wojciech Church and St. Miko\u0142aj Orthodox Church) and the reconstruction of a photo atelier.\nA sizeable art collection is also located in a granary built in 1839. There are two permanent exhibitions there: religious (human and animal sculptures by Stanis\u0142aw Zagajewski known as \"Polish Gaudi\" from group of l`art brut) and an exhibition of works by Wac\u0142aw B\u0119bnowski (ceramic sculptures and functional objects with Art Nouveau motifs, naked nymphs and elements of the Far East). \nExhibitions of Italian, German or Netherlandish art from 17th/18th centuries include: \nPaintings by Carlo Cignani, Georg Philipp Rugendas, Francesco de' Rossi, \ngraphs of Rembrandt van Rijn, Albrecht Altdorfer, Heinrich Aldegrever, Parmigianino, Vespasiano Strada oder Lucas van Leyden.\nBusiness.\nAccording to \"Rzeczpospolita\" report: the major corporations are:\nThere are many other international companies: Delecta (Rieber&amp;Son)- Orkla Group, Norway; Top2000 - Hamelin Group, France; Drumet - WireCo Group, USA; Kujawianka/ ATlanta Poland (Bakal Group), Poland; ACPCO2 - Belgium; Ko\u0142o, Sanitec Group - France; Teutonia, Newell Rubbermaid Group - USA; Solvay - Belgium; ACV- Belgium; Remwil, Orlen Group, Poland; Budizol, Poland; Naturana - Germany; PV Prefabet, PV Group - Germany. Many transport and logistic companies have branches in or near the city.\nFrom 2012 the city is part of the Pomeranian Special Economic Zone - W\u0142oc\u0142awek Economic Development Area \u2013 Industrial and Technological Park with tax-free areas and incentives for investors. The city is located at the A1 highway and close to the A2 highway, directly to three Polish National roads, riverway (Vistula) to Gda\u0144sk, Berlin or Warsaw and fast rail line with many directions. W\u0142oc\u0142awek has also own energy plants (Power Plant of Anwil/ Orlen, Municipal Power Plant of City W\u0142oc\u0142awek, Water Power Plant on Vistula River).\nAnother investment in W\u0142oc\u0142awek is Teren Inwestycyjny Papie\u017cka (Investment area Papiezka) with full infrastructure and railway siding.\nThere are also big investment areas near W\u0142oc\u0142awek, for example in Brze\u015b\u0107 Kujawski (Brzeska Strefa Gospodarcza/ BSG). It is directly at A1 motorway (\"Amber One\"), railway number 18 and has 470 ha open areas for different investments. There are here internal roads, lighting, power and water infrastructure. Here are public and private lots, the most of them free of real estate tax and CIT tax. Here invested already Raben Group and Mercator Medical S.A.,\nAnother investment zone with full infrastructure is Czerniewice Logistic Park of company Arplast in Czerniewice, it is also at A1 motorway and railway line. The biggest advantage is its own railway siding, that is very rare in Poland.\nEducation.\nUniversities and colleges.\nCurrently there are five universities or colleges or branches: \n History of the school\nIn early 1900 the Committee of Civic, which was chaired by Louis Bauer requested the Ministry of Finance to set up a trade school. 27 April 1900, the Ministry of Finance agreed to the creation of W\u0142oc\u0142awskie Siedmioklasowej School of Economics. The founders of the school were 104 inhabitants. The school admitted students were between the ages of 8 and 11 years who, after the annual rate became the first class of students.

The test was of an implosion-design plutonium bomb, or \"gadget\"\u00a0\u2013 the same design as the Fat Man bomb later detonated over Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945. Concerns about whether the complex Fat Man design would work led to a decision to conduct the first nuclear test. The code name \"Trinity\" was assigned by J. Robert Oppenheimer, the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory. The name was possibly inspired by the poetry of John Donne.\nPlanned and directed by Kenneth Bainbridge, the test was conducted in the Jornada del Muerto desert about southeast of Socorro, New Mexico, on what was the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range, but was renamed the White Sands Proving Ground just before the test. The only structures originally in the immediate vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, which scientists used as a laboratory for testing bomb components.\nFears of a fizzle prompted construction of \"Jumbo\", a steel containment vessel that could contain the plutonium, allowing it to be recovered, but Jumbo was not used in the test. On May 7, 1945, a rehearsal was conducted, during which of high explosive spiked with radioactive isotopes was detonated.\n425 people were present on the weekend of the Trinity test. In addition to Bainbridge and Oppenheimer, observers included Vannevar Bush, James Chadwick, James B. Conant, Thomas Farrell, Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Leslie Groves, Frank Oppenheimer, Geoffrey Taylor, Richard Tolman, Edward Teller, and John von Neumann. The Trinity bomb released the explosive energy of \u00b1 , and a large cloud of fallout. Thousands of people lived closer to the test than would have been allowed under guidelines adopted for subsequent tests, but no one living near the test was evacuated before or afterward.\nThe test site was declared a National Historic Landmark district in 1965 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year.\nBackground.\nThe creation of nuclear weapons arose from the scientific and political developments of the 1930s. The decade saw many new discoveries about the nature of atoms, including the existence of nuclear fission. The concurrent rise of fascist governments in Europe led to a fear of a German nuclear weapon project, especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries. When their calculations showed that nuclear weapons were theoretically feasible, the British and United States governments supported an all-out effort to build them.\nThese efforts were transferred to the authority of the U.S. Army in June 1942 and became the Manhattan Project. Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr. was appointed its director in September. The weapons development portion of this project was located at the Los Alamos Laboratory in northern New Mexico, under the directorship of physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. The University of Chicago, Columbia University, and the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, conducted other development work.\nManhattan Project scientists had identified two fissile isotopes for potential use in bombs: uranium-235 and plutonium-239. Uranium-235 became the basis of the Little Boy bomb design, first used (without prior testing) in the bombing of Hiroshima; the design used in the Trinity test, and eventually used in the bombing of Nagasaki (Fat Man), was based on plutonium. The original design considered for a weapon based on plutonium-239 was Thin Man, in which (as in the Little Boy uranium bomb) two subcritical masses of fissile material would be brought rapidly together to form a single critical mass.\nPlutonium is a synthetic element with complicated properties about which little was known at first, as until 1944 it had been produced only in cyclotrons in very pure microgram amounts, whereas a weapon would require kilogram quantities bred in a reactor. In April 1944, Los Alamos physicist Emilio Segr\u00e8 discovered that plutonium produced by the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Clinton Engineer Works contained plutonium-240 as an impurity. Plutonium-240 undergoes spontaneous fission at thousands of times the rate of plutonium-239, and the extra neutrons thereby released made it likely that plutonium in a gun-type fission weapon would detonate too soon after a critical mass was formed, producing a \"fizzle\"\u2014a nuclear explosion many times smaller than a full explosion. The Thin Man design would therefore not work.\nProject scientists then turned to a more technically difficult implosion design. In September 1943, mathematician John von Neumann had proposed surrounding a fissile \"core\" by two different high explosives which produced shock waves of different speeds. Alternating the faster- and slower-burning explosives in a carefully calculated configuration would produce a compressive wave upon their simultaneous detonation. This so-called \"explosive lens\" focused the shock waves inward with sufficient force to rapidly compress the solid plutonium core to several times its original density. The increase in density caused the core\u00a0\u2013 previously subcritical\u00a0\u2013 to become supercritical. At the same time, the shock wave activated a small neutron source at the center of the core, thereby assuring that the chain reaction would begin in earnest immediately at the moment of compression. Such a complicated design required substantial research and experimentation in engineering and hydrodynamics, and in August 1944 the entire Los Alamos Laboratory was reorganized to focus on this work.\nPreparation.\nDecision.\nThe idea of testing the implosion device was brought up in discussions at Los Alamos in January 1944 and attracted enough support for Oppenheimer to approach Groves. Groves gave approval, but he had concerns. The Manhattan Project had spent a great deal of money and effort to produce the plutonium, and he wanted to know whether there would be a way to recover it. The Laboratory's Governing Board then directed Norman Ramsey to investigate how this could be done. In February 1944, Ramsey proposed a small-scale test in which the explosion was limited in size by reducing the number of generations of chain reactions, and that it take place inside a sealed containment vessel from which the plutonium could be recovered.\nThe means of generating such a controlled reaction were uncertain, and the data obtained would not be as useful as that from a full-scale explosion. Oppenheimer argued that the bomb \"must be tested in a range where the energy release is comparable with that contemplated for final use.\" In March 1944, he obtained Groves's tentative approval for testing a full-scale explosion inside a containment vessel, although Groves was still worried about how he would explain the loss of \"a billion dollars worth\" of plutonium in the event the test failed.\nCode name.\nThe origin of the code name \"Trinity\" for the test is unknown, but it is often attributed to Oppenheimer as a reference to the poetry of John Donne, which in turn references the Christian belief of the Trinity. In 1962, Groves wrote to Oppenheimer about the origin of the name, asking if he had chosen it because it was a name common to rivers and peaks in the West and would not attract attention, and elicited this reply:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I did suggest it, but not on that ground\u00a0... Why I chose the name is not clear, but I know what thoughts were in my mind. There is a poem of John Donne, written just before his death, which I know and love. From it a quotation: \"As West and East / In all flatt Maps\u00a0\u2013 and I am one\u00a0\u2013 are one, / So death doth touch the Resurrection.\" That still does not make a Trinity, but in another, better known devotional poem Donne opens: \"Batter my heart, three person'd God.\"\nOrganization.\nIn March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to Kenneth Bainbridge, a professor of physics at Harvard University, working under explosives expert George Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge's group was known as the E-9 (Explosives Development) Group. Stanley Kershaw, formerly from the National Safety Council, was made responsible for safety. Captain Samuel P. Davalos, the assistant post engineer at Los Alamos, was placed in charge of construction. First Lieutenant Harold C. Bush became commander of the Base Camp at Trinity. Scientists William Penney, Victor Weisskopf and Philip Moon were consultants. Eventually seven subgroups were formed:\nThe E-9 group was renamed the X-2 (Development, Engineering and Tests) Group in the August 1944 reorganization.\nTest site.\nSafety and security required a remote, isolated and unpopulated area. The scientists also wanted a flat area to minimize secondary effects of the blast, and with little wind to spread radioactive fallout. Eight candidate sites were considered: the Tularosa Valley; the Jornada del Muerto Valley; the area southwest of Cuba, New Mexico, and north of Thoreau; and the lava flats of the El Malpais National Monument, all in New Mexico; the San Luis Valley near the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in Colorado; the Desert Training Area and San Nicolas Island in Southern California; and the sand bars of Padre Island, Texas.\nThe sites were surveyed by car and by air by Bainbridge, R. W. Henderson, Major W. A. Stevens, and Major Peer de Silva. The site finally chosen on September 7, 1944, after consulting with Major General Uzal Ent, the commander of the Second Air Force, lay at the northern end of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, in Socorro County near the towns of Carrizozo and San Antonio (). The Alamogordo Bombing Range was renamed the White Sands Proving Ground on July 9, 1945, one week before the test. Despite the criterion that the site be isolated, nearly half a million people lived within of the test site; soon after the Trinity test, the Manhattan Project's chief medical officer, Colonel Stafford L. Warren, recommended that future tests be conducted at least 150 miles from populated areas.\nThe only structures in the vicinity were the McDonald Ranch House and its ancillary buildings, about to the southeast. Like the rest of the Alamogordo Bombing Range, it had been acquired by the government in 1942. The patented land had been condemned and grazing rights suspended. Scientists used this as a laboratory for testing bomb components. Bainbridge and Davalos drew up plans for a base camp with accommodation and facilities for 160 personnel, along with the technical infrastructure to support the test. A construction firm from Lubbock, Texas, built the barracks, officers' quarters, mess hall and other basic facilities. The requirements expanded and by July 1945 250 people worked at the Trinity test site. On the weekend of the test, there were 425 present.\nLieutenant Bush's twelve-man MP unit arrived at the site from Los Alamos on December 30, 1944. This unit established initial security checkpoints and horse patrols. The distances around the site proved too great for the horses, so they were repurposed for polo playing, and the MPs resorted to using jeeps and trucks for transportation. Maintenance of morale among men working long hours under harsh conditions along with dangerous reptiles and insects was a challenge. Bush strove to improve the food and accommodation and to provide organized games and nightly movies.\nThroughout 1945, other personnel arrived at the Trinity Site to help prepare for the bomb test. They tried to use water out of the ranch wells, but found the water so alkaline, it was not drinkable. They were forced to use U.S. Navy saltwater soap and hauled drinking water in from the firehouse in Socorro. Gasoline and diesel were purchased from the Standard Oil plant there. Freshwater was trucked in, per load, from away. Military and civilian construction personnel built warehouses, workshops, a magazine and commissary. The railroad siding at Pope, New Mexico, was upgraded by adding an unloading platform. Roads were built, and of telephone wire were strung. Electricity was supplied by portable generators. Bomb shelters to protect test observers were the most expensive to construct.\nDue to its proximity to the bombing range, the base camp was accidentally bombed twice in May. When the lead plane on a practice night raid accidentally knocked out the generator or otherwise doused the lights illuminating their target, they went in search of the lights, and since they had not been informed of the presence of the Trinity base camp, and it was lit, they bombed it instead. The accidental bombing damaged the stables and the carpentry shop, and a small fire resulted.\nJumbo.\nResponsibility for the design of a containment vessel for an unsuccessful explosion, known as \"Jumbo\", was assigned to Robert W. Henderson and Roy W. Carlson of the Los Alamos Laboratory's X-2A Section. The bomb would be placed into the heart of Jumbo, and if the bomb's detonation was unsuccessful the walls of Jumbo would not be breached, making it possible to recover the bomb's plutonium. Hans Bethe, Victor Weisskopf, and Joseph O. Hirschfelder made the initial calculations, followed by a more detailed analysis by Henderson and Carlson. They drew up specifications for a steel sphere in diameter, weighing and capable of handling a pressure of . After consulting with the steel companies and the railroads, which would transport the vessel, Carlson produced a scaled-back cylindrical design that would be much easier to manufacture. Carlson identified a company that normally made boilers for the Navy, Babcock &amp; Wilcox; they had made something similar and were willing to attempt its manufacture.\nAs delivered in May 1945, Jumbo was in diameter and long with walls thick, and weighed . A special train brought it from the Babcock &amp; Wilcox plant in Barberton, Ohio, to the siding at Pope, where it was loaded on a large trailer and towed across the desert by crawler tractors. At the time, it was the heaviest item ever shipped by rail.\nFor many of the Los Alamos scientists, Jumbo was \"the physical manifestation of the lowest point in the Laboratory's hopes for the success of an implosion bomb.\" By the time it arrived, the reactors at the Hanford Engineer Works produced plutonium in quantity, and Oppenheimer was confident that there would be enough for a second test. The use of Jumbo would interfere with the gathering of data on the explosion, the primary objective of the test. An explosion of more than would vaporize the steel and make it difficult to measure the thermal effects. Even would send fragments flying, presenting a hazard to personnel and measuring equipment. It was therefore decided not to use it. Instead, it was hoisted up a steel tower from the explosion, where it could be used for a subsequent test. In the end, Jumbo survived the explosion, although its tower did not.\nJumbo was destroyed on April 16, 1946, when an Army ordnance team detonated eight 500 lb bombs in the bottom of the steel container. Jumbo, with its steel banding around the middle, had been designed to contain the 5,000 lbs of high explosive in the atomic bomb while it was suspended in the center of the vessel. With the conventional bombs placed in the bottom of Jumbo, the resulting blast sent fragments flying in all directions as far as three quarters of a mile. Who authorized the destruction of Jumbo remains controversial. The rusting skeleton of Jumbo sits in the parking lot at the Trinity site on the White Sands Missile Range, where it was moved in 1979.\nThe development team also considered other methods of recovering active material in the event of a dud explosion. One idea was to cover it with a cone of sand. Another was to suspend the bomb in a tank of water. As with Jumbo, it was decided not to proceed with these means of containment. The CM-10 (Chemistry and Metallurgy) group at Los Alamos also studied how the active material could be chemically recovered after a contained or failed explosion.\n100-ton test.\nBecause there would be only one chance to carry out the test correctly, Bainbridge decided that a rehearsal should be carried out to allow the plans and procedures to be verified, and the instrumentation to be tested and calibrated. Oppenheimer was initially skeptical but gave permission, and he later agreed that it contributed to the success of the Trinity test.\nA wooden platform was constructed to the southeast of Trinity ground zero. The high explosive was piled in its wooden shipping boxes in the shape of a pseudo-octagonal prism on it. The charge consisted of tons of TNT and tons of Composition B (with the total explosive power of approximately ), actually a few tons more than the stated \"100-tons\". Kistiakowsky assured Bainbridge that the explosives used were not susceptible to shock. This was proven correct when some boxes fell off the elevator lifting them up to the platform. Flexible tubing was threaded through the pile of boxes of explosives. A radioactive slug from Hanford with of beta ray activity and of gamma ray activity was dissolved, and Hempelmann poured the solution into the tubing.\nThe test was scheduled for May 5 but was postponed for two days to allow for more equipment to be installed. Requests for further postponements had to be refused because they would have affected the schedule for the main test. The detonation time was set for 04:00 Mountain War Time (MWT), on May 7, but there was a 37-minute delay to allow the observation plane, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit flown by Major Clyde \"Stan\" Shields, to get into position.\nThe fireball of the conventional explosion was visible from Alamogordo Army Air Field away, but there was little shock at the base camp away. Shields thought that the explosion looked \"beautiful\", but it was hardly felt at . Herbert L. Anderson practiced using a converted M4 Sherman tank lined with lead to approach the and blast crater and take a soil sample, although the radioactivity was low enough to allow several hours of unprotected exposure. An electrical signal of unknown origin caused the explosion to go off 0.25 seconds early, ruining experiments that required split-second timing. The piezoelectric gauges developed by Anderson's team correctly indicated an explosion of 108 tons of TNT, but Luis Alvarez and Waldman's airborne condenser gauges were far less accurate.\nIn addition to uncovering scientific and technological issues, the rehearsal test revealed practical concerns as well. Over 100 vehicles were used for the rehearsal test, but it was realized more would be required for the main test, and they would need better roads and repair facilities. More radios and more telephone lines were required. Lines needed to be buried to prevent damage by vehicles. A teletype was installed to allow better communication with Los Alamos. A town hall was built to allow for large conferences and briefings, and the mess hall had to be upgraded. Because dust thrown up by vehicles interfered with some of the instrumentation, of road were sealed.\nThe bomb.\nThe term \"gadget\"\u2014a laboratory euphemism for a bomb\u2014gave the laboratory's weapon physics division, \"G Division\", its name in August 1944. At that time it did not refer specifically to the Trinity Test device as that had yet to be developed, but once it was, it became the laboratory code name. The Trinity bomb was officially a Y-1561 device, as was the Fat Man used later in the bombing of Nagasaki. The two were very similar, though the Trinity bomb lacked fuzing and external ballistic casing. The bombs were still under development, and small changes continued to be made to the Fat Man design.\nTo keep the design as simple as possible, a nearly solid spherical core was chosen rather than a hollow one, although calculations showed that a hollow core would be more efficient in its use of plutonium. The core was compressed to prompt super-criticality by the implosion generated by the high explosive lens. This design became known as a \"Christy Core\" or \"Christy pit\" after physicist Robert F. Christy, who made the solid pit design a reality after it was initially proposed by Edward Teller.\nOf the several allotropes of plutonium, the metallurgists preferred the malleable \u03b4 (delta) phase. This was stabilized at room temperature by alloying it with 5% gallium. Two equal hemispheres of plutonium-gallium alloy were plated with silver, and designated by serial numbers HS-1 and HS-2. The radioactive core generated 15 W of heat, which warmed it up to about , and the silver plating developed blisters that had to be filed down and covered with gold foil; later cores were plated with nickel instead.\nA trial assembly of the bomb, without active components or explosive lenses, was carried out by the bomb assembly team headed by Norris Bradbury at Los Alamos on July 3. It was driven to Trinity and back. A set of explosive lenses arrived on July 7, followed by a second set on July 10. Each was examined by Bradbury and Kistiakowsky, and the best ones were selected for use. The remainder were handed over to Edward Creutz, who conducted a test detonation at Pajarito Canyon near Los Alamos without nuclear material. Magnetic measurements from this test suggested that the implosion might be insufficiently simultaneous and the bomb would fail. Bethe worked through the night to assess the results and reported that they were consistent with a perfect explosion.\nAssembly of the nuclear capsule began on July 13 at the McDonald Ranch House, where the master bedroom had been turned into a clean room. The polonium-beryllium \"Urchin\" initiator was assembled, and Louis Slotin placed it inside the two hemispheres of the plutonium core. Cyril Smith then placed the core in the natural uranium tamper plug, or \"slug\". Air gaps were filled with gold foil, and the two halves of the plug were held together with uranium washers and screws which fit smoothly into the domed ends of the plug.\nTo better understand the likely effect of a bomb dropped from a plane and detonated in air, and generate less nuclear fallout, the bomb was to be detonated atop a steel tower. The bomb was driven to the base of the tower, where a temporary eye bolt was screwed into the capsule and a chain hoist was used to lower the capsule into the bomb. As the capsule entered the hole in the uranium tamper, it stuck. Robert Bacher realized that the heat from the plutonium core had caused the capsule to expand, while the explosives assembly with the tamper had cooled during the night in the desert. By leaving the capsule in contact with the tamper, the temperatures equalized and, in a few minutes, the capsule had slipped completely into the tamper. The eye bolt was then removed from the capsule and replaced with a threaded uranium plug, a boron disk was placed on top of the capsule (to complete the thin spherical shell of plastic boron around the tamper), an aluminum plug was screwed into the hole in the pusher (aluminum shell surrounding the tamper), and the two remaining high explosive lenses were installed. Finally, the upper Dural polar cap was bolted into place. The assembly of active material and high explosives was finished at 17:45 hours on 13 July.\nThe test tower's four legs rested on concrete footings extending into the ground; at its top, an oak platform formed the floor of a corrugated iron shack open to the west. The gadget was hauled up the tower with an electric winch. A truckload of mattresses was placed underneath in case the cable broke and the gadget fell. A crew then attached each of the 32 Model 1773 EBW detonators. Full assembly of the bomb was completed by 17:00 on July 14. The seven-man arming party, consisting of Bainbridge, Kistiakowsky, Joseph McKibben and four soldiers including Lieutenant Bush, drove out to the tower to perform the final arming shortly after 22:00 on July 15.\nPersonnel.\nIn the final two weeks before the test, some 250 personnel from Los Alamos were at work at the Trinity Site, and Lieutenant Bush's command had ballooned to 125 men guarding and maintaining the base camp. Another 160 men under Major T.O. Palmer were stationed outside the area with vehicles to evacuate the civilian population in the surrounding region should that prove necessary. They had enough vehicles to move 450 people to safety and had food and supplies to last them for two days. Arrangements were made for Alamogordo Army Air Field to provide accommodation. Groves warned Governor of New Mexico John J. Dempsey that martial law might have to be declared in the southwestern part of the state.\nShelters were established due north, west, and south of the tower, each with its own chief: Robert Wilson at N-10,000, John Manley at W-10,000 and Frank Oppenheimer at S-10,000. Many other observers were around away, and some others were scattered at different distances, some in more informal situations. Richard Feynman claimed to be the only person to see the explosion without the goggles provided, relying on a truck windshield to screen out harmful ultraviolet wavelengths. Bainbridge asked Groves to keep his VIP list down to ten. He chose himself, Oppenheimer, Richard Tolman, Vannevar Bush, James Conant, Brigadier General Thomas F. Farrell, Charles Lauritsen, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, and Sir James Chadwick. The VIPs viewed the test from Compania Hill (also called Compa\u00f1a Hill or Cerro de la Colorado), about northwest of the tower.\nPhotographic film was placed in nearby towns to detect radioactive contamination, and seismographs were placed in Tucson, Denver, and Chihuahua, Mexico, to determine how far the explosion could be sensed. Calculations stated that even if the mechanical and electrical systems did not fail, the likelihood of a non-optimal test was greater than 10%. The observers set up a betting pool on the results of the test. Teller was the most optimistic, predicting . He wore gloves to protect his hands and sunglasses underneath the welding goggles that the government had supplied everyone with. He was one of the few scientists to watch the test (with eye protection), instead of following orders to lie on the ground with his back turned. He also brought suntan lotion, which he shared with the others. Ramsey chose zero (a complete dud), Robert Oppenheimer chose , Kistiakowsky , and Bethe chose . Rabi, the last to arrive, took the only remaining choice\u00a0\u2013 , which turned out to be the winner. Bethe later stated that his choice of 8 kt was exactly the value calculated by Segr\u00e8, and he was swayed by Segr\u00e8's authority over that of a more junior [but unnamed] member of Segr\u00e8's group who had calculated 20 kt.\nEnrico Fermi offered to take wagers among the top physicists and military present on whether the atmosphere would ignite, and if so whether it would destroy just the state or incinerate the entire planet. This last result had been previously calculated by Bethe to be almost impossible, although for a while it had caused some of the scientists some anxiety. Bainbridge was furious with Fermi for frightening the guards, some of whom asked to be relieved; his own biggest fear was that nothing at all would happen, in which case he would have to return to the tower to investigate.\nExplosion.\nDetonation.\nThe scientists wanted good visibility, low humidity, light winds at low altitude, and westerly winds at high altitude for the test. The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the Potsdam Conference was due to start on July 16 and President Harry S. Truman wanted the test to be conducted before the conference began. It was therefore scheduled for July 16, the earliest date at which the bomb components would be available.\nThe detonation was initially planned for 04:00 MWT but was postponed because of rain and lightning from early that morning. It was feared that the danger from radiation and fallout would be increased by rain, and lightning had the scientists concerned about a premature detonation, as had happened with a model of the electrical system. A crucial favorable weather report came in at 04:45, and the final twenty-minute countdown began at 05:10, read by Samuel Allison. A rocket launched at 5:25 to signal five minutes before detonation; another rocket fired at 5:29. At 5:29:15, a switch in the control bunker started the detonation timer. By 05:30 the rain had gone. There were some communication problems: the shortwave radio frequency for communicating with the B-29s was shared with the Voice of America, and the FM radios shared a frequency with a railroad freight yard in San Antonio, Texas.\nTwo circling B-29s observed the test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of Project Alberta who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic bombing missions over Japan. These included Captain Deak Parsons, the associate director of the Los Alamos Laboratory and the head of Project Alberta; Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, Bernard Waldman, Wolfgang Panofsky, and William Penney. The overcast sky obscured their view of the test site.\nAt 05:29:21 MWT (11:29:21 GMT) \u00b1 15 seconds, the device exploded with an energy equivalent to . The desert sand, largely made of silica, melted and became a mildly radioactive light green glass, which was named trinitite. The explosion created a crater approximately deep and wide. The radius of the trinitite layer was approximately . The 100-foot tower was completely vaporized. At the time of detonation, the surrounding mountains were illuminated \"brighter than daytime\" for one to two seconds, and the heat was reported as \"being as hot as an oven\" at the base camp. The observed colors of the illumination changed from purple to green and eventually to white. The roar of the shock wave took 40 seconds to reach the observers. It was felt over away, and the mushroom cloud reached in height.\nMany observers recalled their amazement at the light from the explosion. Conant wrote, \"The enormity of the light and its length quite stunned me\". Lawrence, away, wrote of being \"enveloped with a warm brilliant yellow white light\u2014from darkness to brilliant sunshine in an instant\". Ralph Carlisle Smith, watching from Compania Hill, wrote:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was staring straight ahead with my open left eye covered by a welder's glass and my right eye remaining open and uncovered. Suddenly, my right eye was blinded by a light which appeared instantaneously all about without any build up of intensity. My left eye could see the ball of fire start up like a tremendous bubble or nob-like mushroom. I dropped the glass from my left eye almost immediately and watched the light climb upward. The light intensity fell rapidly, hence did not blind my left eye but it was still amazingly bright. It turned yellow, then red, and then beautiful purple. At first it had a translucent character, but shortly turned to a tinted or colored white smoke appearance. The ball of fire seemed to rise in something of toadstool effect. Later the column proceeded as a cylinder of white smoke; it seemed to move ponderously. A hole was punched through the clouds, but two fog rings appeared well above the white smoke column. There was a spontaneous cheer from the observers. Dr. von Neumann said, \"that was at least 5,000 tons and probably a lot more.\"\nThe only female staff member officially invited to watch the test was Mary Argo, but Joan Hinton snuck in: It was like being at the bottom of an ocean of light. We were bathed in it from all directions. The light withdrew into the bomb as if the bomb sucked it up. Then it turned purple and blue and went up and up and up. We were still talking in whispers when the cloud reached the level where it was struck by the rising sunlight so it cleared out the natural clouds. We saw a cloud that was dark and red at the bottom and daylight on the top. Then suddenly the sound reached us. It was very sharp and rumbled and all the mountains were rumbling with it. We suddenly started talking out loud and felt exposed to the whole world.\nIn his official report on the test, Thomas Farrell (who initially exclaimed, \"The long-hairs have let it get away from them!\") wrote: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The lighting effects beggared description. The whole country was lighted by a searing light with the intensity many times that of the midday sun. It was golden, purple, violet, gray, and blue. It lighted every peak, crevasse and ridge of the nearby mountain range with a clarity and beauty that cannot be described but must be seen to be imagined\u00a0...\nWilliam L. Laurence of \"The New York Times\" had been transferred temporarily to the Manhattan Project at Groves's request in early 1945. Groves had arranged for Laurence to view significant events, including Trinity and the atomic bombing of Japan. Laurence wrote press releases with the help of the Manhattan Project's public relations staff. He later recalled: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A loud cry filled the air. The little groups that hitherto had stood rooted to the earth like desert plants broke into dance, the rhythm of primitive man dancing at one of his fire festivals at the coming of Spring.\nAfter the initial euphoria of witnessing the explosion had passed, Bainbridge told Oppenheimer, \"Now we are all sons of bitches.\" Rabi noticed Oppenheimer's reaction: \"I'll never forget his walk\"; Rabi recalled, \"I'll never forget the way he stepped out of the car\u00a0... his walk was like \"High Noon\"\u00a0... this kind of strut. He had done it.\"\nOppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from a Hindu holy book, the \"Bhagavad Gita\" (XI,12):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\nYears later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the \"Bhagavad Gita\"; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.\nJohn R. Lugo was flying a U.S. Navy transport at , east of Albuquerque, en route to the west coast. \"My first impression was, like, the sun was coming up in the south. What a ball of fire! It was so bright it lit up the cockpit of the plane.\" Lugo radioed Albuquerque. He got no explanation for the blast but was told, \"Don't fly south.\"\nInstrumentation and measurements.\nThe T (Theoretical) Division at Los Alamos had predicted a yield of between . Immediately after the blast, two lead-lined M4 Sherman tanks made their way to the crater. Radiochemical analysis of soil samples that they collected indicated that the total yield (or energy release) had been around . This method turned out to be the most accurate means of determining the efficiency of a nuclear explosion and was used for many years after.\nThe energy of the blast wave was measured by a large number of sensors using a variety of physical principles. The piezoelectric blast gauges were thrown off scale and no records were obtained. The excess-velocity blast-yield measurement (precise measurement of the velocity of sound at the site of the explosion and then comparing it with the velocity of the blast wave) provided among the most accurate measurements of the blast pressure. Another method was to use the aluminum diaphragm box gauges designed to record the peak pressure of the blast wave. These indicated a blast energy of \u00b1 . They were supplemented by a large number of other types of mechanical pressure gauges. And only one of them gave a reasonable result of about .\nFermi conducted his own experiment to measure the energy that was released as blast. He later recalled:&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;About 40 seconds after the explosion the air blast reached me. I tried to estimate its strength by dropping from about six feet small pieces of paper before, during, and after the passage of the blast wave. Since, at the time, there was no wind I could observe very distinctly and actually measure the displacement of the pieces of paper that were in the process of falling while the blast was passing. The shift was about 2 1/2 meters, which, at the time, I estimated to correspond to the blast that would be produced by ten thousand tons of T.N.T.\nThere were also several gamma ray and neutron detectors; few survived the blast, with all the gauges within of ground zero being destroyed, but sufficient data were recovered to measure the gamma ray component of the ionizing radiation released.\nSome fifty different cameras had been set up, taking motion and still photographs. Special Fastax cameras taking 10,000 frames per second would record the minute details of the explosion. Spectrograph cameras would record the wavelengths of light emitted by the explosion, and pinhole cameras would record gamma rays. A rotating drum spectrograph at the station would obtain the spectrum over the first hundredth of a second. Another, slow recording one would track the fireball. Cameras were placed in bunkers only from the tower, protected by steel and lead glass, and mounted on sleds so they could be towed out by the lead-lined tank. Some observers brought their own cameras despite the security. Segr\u00e8 brought in Jack Aeby with his 35\u00a0mm Perfex 44. He took the only well-exposed color photograph of the detonation explosion.\nThe official estimate for the total yield of the Trinity bomb, which includes the energy of the blast component together with the contributions from the explosion's light output and both forms of ionizing radiation, is , of which about was contributed by fission of the plutonium core, and about was from fission of the natural uranium tamper. A re-analysis of data published in 2021 put the yield at .\nAs a result of the data gathered on the size of the blast, the detonation height for the bombing of Hiroshima was set at to take advantage of the Mach stem blast reinforcing effect. The final Nagasaki burst height was so the Mach stem started sooner. The knowledge that implosion worked led Oppenheimer to recommend to Groves that the uranium-235 used in a Little Boy gun-type weapon could be used more economically in a Fat Man implosion-type weapon containing a composite core with plutonium and enriched uranium. It was too late to do this with the first Little Boy, but the composite cores would soon enter production.\nCivilian detection.\nThe light from the test was visible as far as Amarillo, Texas, and a mountain range away from Trinity. The Second Air Force issued a press release with a cover story that Groves had prepared weeks before, which described the explosion as the accidental destruction of a magazine on the base. The press release, written by Laurence, stated: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Alamogordo, N.M., July 16\nThe commanding officer of the Alamogordo Army Air Base made the following statement today: \"Several inquiries have been received concerning a heavy explosion which occurred on the Alamogordo Air base reservation this morning. A remotely located ammunition magazine containing a considerable amount of high explosives and pyrotechnics exploded. There was no loss of life or injury to anyone, and the property damage outside of the explosives magazine was negligible. Weather conditions affecting the content of gas shells exploded by the blast may make it desirable for the Army to evacuate temporarily a few civilians from their homes.\"\nLaurence had prepared four releases, covering outcomes ranging from a cover story for a successful test (the one which was used) to catastrophic scenarios involving serious damage to surrounding communities, evacuation of nearby residents, and a placeholder for the names of those killed. As Laurence was a witness to the test, he knew that the last release, if used, might be his own obituary. A newspaper article published the same day stated that \"the blast was seen and felt throughout an area extending from El Paso to Silver City, Gallup, Socorro, and Albuquerque.\" The articles appeared in New Mexico, but East Coast newspapers ignored them, and local residents who saw the light accepted the cover story.\nInformation about the Trinity test was made public shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima. The Smyth Report, released on August 12, 1945, gave some information on the blast, and the edition released by Princeton University Press a few weeks later incorporated the War Department's press release on the test as Appendix 6, and contained the famous pictures of a \"bulbous\" Trinity fireball.\nOfficial notifications.\nThe results of the test were conveyed to Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson at the Potsdam Conference in Germany in a coded message from his assistant George L. Harrison:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Operated on this morning. Diagnosis not yet complete but results seem satisfactory and already exceed expectations. Local press release necessary as interest extends great distance. Dr. Groves pleased. He returns tomorrow. I will keep you posted.\nThe message arrived at the \"Little White House\" in the Potsdam suburb of Babelsberg and was at once taken to Truman and Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. Harrison sent a follow-up message which arrived on the morning of July 18:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Doctor has just returned most enthusiastic and confident that the little boy is as husky as his big brother. The light in his eyes discernible from here to Highhold and I could have heard his screams from here to my farm.\nBecause Stimson's summer home at Highhold was on Long Island and Harrison's farm near Upperville, Virginia, this indicated that the explosion could be seen away and heard away.\nThree days later, on July 21, a 13-page report written by Groves arrived at Potsdam via a courier. It stated:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At 0530, 16 July 1945, in a remote section of the Alamogordo Air Base, New Mexico, the first full scale test was made of the implosion type atomic fission bomb. For the first time in history there was a nuclear explosion. And what an explosion! ... The test was successful beyond the most optimistic expectations of anyone.\nFallout.\nFilm badges used to measure exposure to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 had been exposed to more than 0.1 roentgens (half of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements recommended daily radiation exposure limit), but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more efficient than expected, and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. Nevertheless, the fission consumed only out of the of plutonium, leaving to be spread through the atmosphere and as fallout. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.\nThe heaviest fallout contamination outside the restricted test area was from the detonation point, on Chupadera Mesa. The fallout there was reported to have settled in a white mist onto some of the livestock in the area, resulting in local beta burns and a temporary loss of dorsal or back hair. Patches of hair grew back discolored white. The Army bought 88 cattle in all from ranchers; the 17 most significantly marked were kept at Los Alamos, while the rest were shipped to Oak Ridge for long-term observation.\nDose reconstruction published in 2020 under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute documented that five counties in New Mexico experienced the greatest radioactive contamination: Guadalupe, Lincoln, San Miguel, Socorro, and Torrance. People living in the surrounding area near the site were unaware of the project and later not included in the 1990 Radiation Exposure Compensation Act support for affected \"downwinders\" which addressed serious community health problems resulting from similar tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site. Efforts in Congress to add the New Mexico residents to the population covered by the bill continued in 2024.\nIn August 1945, shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima, the Kodak Company observed spotting and fogging on its film, which was at that time usually packaged in cardboard containers. J. H. Webb, an employee of the Kodak Company, studied the matter and concluded that the contamination must have come from a nuclear explosion somewhere in the United States. He discounted the possibility that the Hiroshima bomb was responsible because of the timing of the events. A hot spot of fallout contaminated the river water that a paper mill in Indiana used to manufacture the cardboard pulp from corn husks. Aware of the gravity of his discovery, Webb kept this secret until 1949.\nThis incident, along with the next continental US tests in 1951, set a precedent. In subsequent atmospheric nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site, United States Atomic Energy Commission officials gave the photographic industry maps and forecasts of potential contamination, as well as expected fallout distributions, which enabled them to purchase uncontaminated materials and take other protective measures.\nSite today.\nIn September 1953, about 650 people attended the first Trinity Site open house. Visitors to a Trinity Site open house are allowed to see the ground zero and McDonald Ranch House areas. More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site was about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area. The amount of radioactive exposure received during a one-hour visit to the site is about half of the total radiation exposure which a U.S. adult receives on an average day from natural and medical sources.\nOn December 21, 1965, the Trinity Site was declared a National Historic Landmark district, and on October 15, 1966, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The landmark includes the base camp where the scientists and support group lived, ground zero where the bomb was placed for the explosion, and the McDonald ranch house, where the plutonium core to the bomb was assembled. One of the old instrumentation bunkers is visible beside the road just west of ground zero. An inner oblong fence was added in 1967, and the corridor barbed wire fence that connects the outer fence to the inner one was completed in 1972.\nThe Trinity monument, a rough-sided, lava-rock obelisk about high, marks the explosion's hypocenter. It was erected in 1965 by Army personnel using local rocks taken from the western boundary of the range. A special tour of the site on July 16, 1995 (marking the 50th anniversary of the Trinity test) attracted 5,000 visitors. Since then, the site has been open to the public on the first Saturdays of April and October.\nIn popular culture.\nThe Trinity test has been portrayed in various forms of media, including documentary films and dramatizations. In 1946, an 18-minute documentary titled \"Atomic Power\" was produced by Time Inc. under \"The March of Time\" banner and released theatrically. It featured many people involved with the project, including J. Robert Oppenheimer and Ernest Lawrence, as actors in re-creations of real discussions and events that led up to the Trinity test. In 1947, a docudrama titled \"The Beginning or the End\" chronicled the development of nuclear weapons and portrayed the Trinity test.\nIn 1980, a television drama miniseries titled \"Oppenheimer\", a co-production between the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American television station WGBH-TV, aired for seven episodes on BBC Two. The Trinity test is depicted in its fifth episode. In early 1981, a documentary titled \"The Day After Trinity\" was released, focusing closely on the events of the Trinity test. In 1989, a feature film titled \"Fat Man and Little Boy\" depicted the Trinity test. Two documentaries, \"Trinity and Beyond\" and \"The Bomb\", were released in 1995 and 2015 respectively. The 2017 third season of \"Twin Peaks\" prominently features a fantastical depiction of the Trinity test as part of a flashback in its eighth episode, providing an oblique origin story for the show's main antagonist, BOB.\nChristopher Nolan, director of the 2023 film \"Oppenheimer\", called the Trinity test \"the fulcrum that the [film's] whole story turns on.\" He avoided depicting the explosion via computer-generated imagery, instead using practical effects: after a relatively small explosion (using gasoline, propane, aluminum powder, and magnesium) was filmed, forced perspective was used to give viewers the impression of a Trinity-sized explosion. The popularity of the film brought newfound attention to previous media depictions of the Trinity test, such as \"The Day After Trinity\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Thermodynamic properties are defined as characteristic features of a system, capable of specifying the system's state. Some constants, such as the ideal gas constant, R, do not describe the state of a system, and so are not properties. On the other hand, some constants, such as Kf (the freezing point depression constant, or cryoscopic constant), depend on the identity of a substance, and so may be considered to describe the state of a system, and therefore may be considered physical properties.\n\"Specific\" properties are expressed on a per mass basis. If the units were changed from per mass to, for example, per mole, the property would remain as it was (i.e., intensive or extensive).\nRegarding work and heat.\nWork and heat are not thermodynamic properties, but rather \"process quantities:\" flows of energy across a system boundary. Systems do not \"contain\" work, but can \"perform\" work, and likewise, in formal thermodynamics, systems do not \"contain\" heat, but can \"transfer\" heat. Informally, however, a difference in the energy of a system that occurs solely because of a difference in its temperature is commonly called \"heat\", and the energy that flows across a boundary as a result of a temperature difference is \"heat\".\nAltitude (or elevation) is usually not a thermodynamic property. Altitude can help specify the location of a system, but that does not describe the state of the system. An exception would be if the effect of gravity need to be considered in order to describe a state, in which case altitude could indeed be a thermodynamic property.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60040", "revid": "31999835", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60040", "title": "Matera", "text": "Matera (, ; Materano: ) is a city and the capital of the Province of Matera in the region of Basilicata, in Southern Italy. With a history of continuous occupation dating back to prehistory (the eighth millennium BC), it is renowned for its rock-cut urban core, whose twin cliffside zones are known collectively as the Sassi.\nMatera lies on the right bank of the Gravina river, whose canyon forms a geological boundary between the hill country of Basilicata (historic Lucania) to the southwest and the Murgia plateau of Apulia to the northeast. The city began as a complex of cave habitations excavated in the softer limestone on the gorge's western, Lucanian face. It took advantage of two streams that flow into the ravine from a spot near the Castello Tramontano, reducing the cliff's angle of drop and leaving a defensible narrow promontory between the streams. The central high ground, or acropolis, supporting the city's cathedral and administrative buildings, came to be known as Civita, and the settlement districts scaling down and burrowing into the sheer rock faces as the Sassi. Of the two streambeds, called the \"grabiglioni\", the northern hosts Sasso Barisano (facing Bari) and the southern Sasso Caveoso (facing Montescaglioso).\nThe Sassi consist of approximately twelve levels spanning the height of 380 m, connected by a network of paths, stairways, and courtyards (\"vicinati\"). The medieval city clinging on to the edge of the canyon for its defense is invisible from the western approach. The tripartite urban structure of Civita and the two Sassi, relatively isolated from each other, survived until the sixteenth century, when the centre of public life moved outside the walls to the Piazza Sedile in the open plain (the Piano) to the west, followed by the shift of the elite residences to the Piano from the seventeenth century onward. By the end of the eighteenth century, a physical class boundary separated the overcrowded Sassi of the peasants from the new spatial order of their social superiors in the Piano, and geographical elevation came to coincide with status more overtly than before, to the point where the two communities no longer interacted socially.\nYet it was only at the turn of the twentieth century that the Sassi were declared unfit for modern habitation, and the government relocation of all their inhabitants to new housing in the Piano followed between 1952 and the 1970s. A new law in 1986 opened the path to restoration and reoccupation of the Sassi, this time \u2013 as noted by the architectural historian Anne Toxey \u2013 for the benefit of the wealthy middle class. The recognition of the Sassi, labelled (\"the underground city\"), together with the rupestrian churches across the Gravina as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in December 1993 has assisted in attracting tourism and accelerated the reclaiming of the site. In 2019, Matera was declared a European Capital of Culture.\nHistory.\nBefore its integration into the modern Italian state, the city of Matera had experienced the rule of the Romans, Lombards, Arabs, Byzantine Greeks, Swabians, Angevins, Aragonese, and Bourbons.\nAlthough scholars continue to debate the date the dwellings were first occupied in Matera, and the continuity of their subsequent occupation, the area of what is now Matera is believed to have been settled since the Palaeolithic (tenth millennium BC). This makes it potentially one of the oldest continually inhabited settlements in the world. Alternatively, it has been suggested by Anne Toxey that the area has been \"occupied continuously for at least three millennia\".\nBuilt on an entrenched prehistoric village, the town is likely to have Greek origins. In the times of Magna Graecia, Matera shared a close relationship with the Greek cities on the southern coast, becoming a trade and transit route in Roman times.Then the town of Matera was established by the Roman Lucius Caecilius Metellus in 251 BC who called it \"Matheola\". In AD 664, Matera was conquered by the Lombards and became part of the Duchy of Benevento. During the seventh and eighth centuries, the nearby grottos were colonised by both Benedictine and Basilian monastic institutions. After the Arab conquest of Bari in 840, Matera came under Islamic rule. Emancipated from the old Lombard jurisdiction of the gastald of Acerenza in the Principality of Salerno, the town gained regional prominence.\nIn the spring of 867, it was burnt by the imperial troops of Louis II as the first key target in the emirate's conquest; the Chronicle of St. Benedict of Monte Cassino calls it a particularly well-defended site. The Franks soon fell out with the Lombards and the Byzantines, exploited the local need for protection from Arab raiding and internal Lombard divisions, to retake Apulia, which became the theme of Longobardia in 891/2. Already by 887, Matera's local Lombard elite bore Byzantine titles, the monastery of San Vincenzo al Volturno had to conduct business before the Byzantine judge and town notables of Matera, and the Greeks of Matera made up the Byzantine garrison of Naples. The precarious Byzantine rule had to contend with the ambitions of Lombard towns and nobles against the background of frequent incursions from the neighbouring duchy of Capua-Benevento and from Arab Sicily. In 940 Matera was besieged, possibly with local assistance, by the Lombards.\nOn 25 January 982 the army of Otto II camped before the walls of Matera on its way from Salerno to Taranto, ostensibly marching against the Arabs. In 994 Matera was temporarily captured by the Arabs after a four-month siege. The town continued to play a part in Byzantine governance: in June 1019 the chartoularios Stephanos of Matera assisted in the re-foundation of Troia. But civic unrest was also endemic and in 1040 the Byzantine judge Romanos was murdered at Matera by the local auxiliary troops during a wave of assaults on Byzantine officials that swept across the region. After the prominent Apulian rebels enlisted the support of the Normans and defeated the new katepano of Italy at Cannae in 1041, Matera fell within the scope of Norman incursions and struck a deal with the invaders. In retaliation for this, the next katepano Georgios Maniakes, dispatched to Italy with special powers in April 1042, carried out mass executions in Matera in June, only to launch a rebellion of his own in September.\nAfter his departure Matera elected William Iron Arm as its count (1042), but like other towns it remained in Byzantine hands despite the Norman advances \u2013 in 1054 died Sico, the protospatharios of Matera. The city was seized in April 1064 as an independent acquisition by Robert, Count of Montescaglioso, a seditious nephew of Robert Guiscard, who profited from the involvement of his uncle further south. After count Robert died in July 1080, Matera accepted the rule of his brother Geoffrey of Conversano. Geoffrey's son Alexander joined a revolt against Roger II in 1132, but he fled before the advance of the king to Byzantium and left his son Geoffrey in Matera, whose inhabitants gave the city away to avoid being massacred by the royal troops. Alexander later took part in the Byzantine invasion of Italy in 1156. Lombard aristocrats survived with a reduced status: around 1150, Guaimar (III) of Capaccio, a descendant of Lombard princes, held a sub-fief near Matera from the count of Montescaglioso. Meanwhile, after a period of association with the Byzantine metropolis of Otranto from 968, the episcopal see of Matera was reclaimed by the archbishopric of Acerenza. A new cathedral church of St Eustace was consecrated in May 1082.\nAfter a short communal phase and a series of pestilences and earthquakes, the city became an Aragonese possession in the fifteenth century, and on 1 October 1497, the city was sold to Giancarlo Tramontano. In 1514, however, the population rebelled against the oppression and killed Count Giovanni Carlo Tramontano. In the seventeenth century Matera was handed over to the Orsini and then became part of the Terra d'Otranto, in Apulia. Later it was capital of the province of Basilicata, a position it retained until 1806, when Joseph Bonaparte assigned it to Potenza.\nIn 1927, it became capital of the new province of Matera.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nGovernment.\nSince local government political reorganization in 1993, Matera has been governed by the city council of Matera. Voters elect directly 32 councilors and the mayor of Matera every five years.\nMain sights.\nThe Sassi (ancient town).\nMatera has gained international fame for its ancient town, the \"Sassi di Matera\". The Sassi originated in a prehistoric troglodyte settlement, and these dwellings are thought to be among the earliest human settlements in what is now Italy. The Sassi are habitations dug into the calcareous rock, which is characteristic of Basilicata and Apulia. Many of them are really little more than small caverns, and in some parts of the Sassi a street lies on top of another group of dwellings. The ancient town grew up on one slope of the rocky ravine created by a river that is now a small stream, and this ravine is known locally as \"la Gravina\". In the 1950s, as part of a policy to clear the extreme poverty of the Sassi, the government of Italy used force to relocate most of the population of the Sassi to new public housing in the developing modern city.\nUntil the late 1980s the Sassi was still considered an area of poverty, since its dwellings were, and in most cases still are, uninhabitable and dangerous. The present local administration, however, has become more tourism-orientated, and it has promoted the regeneration of the Sassi as a picturesque tourist attraction with the aid of the Italian government, UNESCO, and Hollywood. In 2008, the city began the candidacy process for a European Capital of Culture in 2019; it was designated one of the European Capitals of Culture for 2019 on 17 October 2014. Today there are many thriving businesses, pubs, and hotels there, and the city is amongst the fastest growing in southern Italy.\nMonasteries and churches.\nMatera preserves a large and diverse collection of buildings related to the Christian faith, including a large number of rupestrian churches carved from the calcarenite rock of the region. These churches, which are also found in the neighbouring region of Apulia, were listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund.\n\"Matera Cathedral\" (1268\u20131270) has been dedicated to Santa Maria della Bruna since 1389. Built in an Apulian Romanesque architectural style, the church has a 52\u00a0m tall bell tower, and next to the main gate is a statue of the Maria della Bruna, backed by those of Saints Peter and Paul. The main feature of the fa\u00e7ade is the rose window, divided by sixteen small columns. The interior is on the Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles. The decoration is mainly from the eighteenth century Baroque restoration, but recently a Byzantine-style fourteenth-century fresco portraying the \"Last Judgement\" has been discovered.\nTwo other important churches in Matera, both dedicated to the Apostle Peter, are San Pietro Caveoso (in the \"Sasso Caveoso\") and San Pietro Barisano (in the \"Sasso Barisano\"). San Pietro Barisano was recently restored in a project by the World Monuments Fund, funded by American Express. The main altar and the interior frescoes were cleaned, and missing pieces of mouldings, reliefs, and other adornments were reconstructed from photographic archives or surrounding fragments.\nThere are many other churches and monasteries dating back throughout the history of the Christian church. Some are simple caves with a single altar, occasionally accompanied by a fresco, often located on the opposite side of the ravine. Some are complex cave networks with large underground chambers, thought to have been used for meditation by the rupestrian and cenobitic monks.\nCisterns and water collection.\nMatera was built above a deep ravine called Gravina of Matera that divides the territory into two areas. Matera was built such that it is hidden, but made it difficult to provide a water supply to its inhabitants. Early dwellers invested tremendous energy in building cisterns and systems of water channels.\nThe largest cistern has been found under Piazza Vittorio Veneto, the Palombaro Lungo that was built in 1832. With its solid pillars carved from the rock and a vault height of more than fifteen metres, it is a veritable water cathedral, which is navigable by boat. Like other cisterns in the town, it collected rainwater that was filtered and flowed in a controlled way to the Sassi.\nThere were also a large number of little superficial canals that fed pools and hanging gardens. Moreover, many bell-shaped cisterns in dug houses were filled up by seepage. Later, when the population increased, many of these cisterns were turned into houses and other kinds of water-harvesting systems were realised.\nSome of these more recent facilities have the shape of houses submerged in the earth.\nNatural areas.\nThe \"Murgia National Park\" (Parco della Murgia Materana), a regional park established in 1990, includes the territory of the Gravina di Matera and about 150 rock churches scattered along the slopes of the ravines and the plateau of the Murgia. This area, inhabited since prehistoric times, still preserves stationing dating back to the Paleolithic, such as the Grotta dei pipistrelli (cave of the bats), and to the Neolithic. The symbol of the park is the lesser kestrel.\nThe San Giuliano Regional Reserve, a protected area established in 2000, includes Lake San Giuliano, an artificial reservoir created by the damming of the Bradano river, and the river sections upstream and downstream of it.\nTimmari.\n\"Colle di Timmari\", a green plateau located about 15\u00a0km from the city, dominates the Bradano valley and the San Giuliano lake. It is a pleasant residential area, and on the top of the hill there is the small Sanctuary of San Salvatore that dates back to 1310 and an important archaeological area.\nOther sights.\nThe \"Tramontano Castle\", begun in the early sixteenth century by Gian Carlo Tramontano, Count of Matera, is probably the only other structure that is above ground of any great significance outside the sassi. However, the construction remained unfinished after his assassination in the popular riot of 29 December 1514. It has three large towers, while twelve were probably included in the original design. During some restoration work in the main square of the town, workers came across what were believed to be the main footings of another castle tower. However, on further excavation large Roman cisterns were unearthed. Whole house structures were discovered where one may see how the people of that era lived.\nThe \"Palazzo dell'Annunziata\" is a historical building on the main square, seat of Provincial Library.\nCulture.\nOn 17 October 2014, Matera was declared European Capital of Culture for 2019, together with Bulgaria's second-largest city, Plovdiv.\nCuisine.\nThe cuisine of Matera is a typical from Southern Italy. It features a sort of blend of Basilicata and Apulia's cuisines being in a border area between the two regions. Some specialties are \"peperoni cruschi\", a sweet and dry pepper variety very popular in Basilicata, and \"Pane di Matera\", a type of bread recognizable for its intense flavour and conical shape, granted Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. Matera produces an eponymous wine which bears the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) designation.\nSome dishes from the local cuisine include:\nCinema.\nMatera is a popular filming location. It is often labeled as the \"Little Jerusalem\" by filmmakers, being the setting for religious-themed films including \"The Gospel According to St. Matthew\" (1964), \"King David\" (1985), \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004), \"Mary\" (2005), \"The Nativity Story\" (2006), \"The Omen\" (2006). Its surrounding landscape which evokes an archaic and isolated world has been immortalized in films such as \"La lupa\" (1953), \"Il demonio\" (1963), \"Christ Stopped at Eboli\" (1979). Matera is also the setting for action/adventure movies such as \"Wonder Woman\" (2017) and \"No Time to Die\" (2021). Since the late 2010s the city has also attracted Bollywood productions like \"War\" (2019) and \"\" (2023).\nMusic.\nMatera also appears in several music videos, Robin Schulz's \"Sun Goes Down\" (2014) and Metallica's \"Spit Out the Bone\" (2016) among the others.\nReligious traditions.\nThe Feast of the Madonna della Bruna, held in Matera on 2 July each year, is notable for its religious procession featuring an ornamented chariot that will be pulled apart by spectators. The origins of the festival are not well known, because its story has changed while being handed down from generation to generation. One of these legends says that a woman asked a farmer to go up on his wagon to accompany her to Matera. When she arrived to the periphery of the city, she got off the wagon and asked farmer to take her message to the bishop. In this message she said she was Christ's mother. The bishop, the clergy, and the folk rushed to receive the Virgin, but they found a statue. So the statue of Madonna entered in the city on a triumphal wagon. Another legend talks about a destruction of the wagon: Saracens besiege Matera and the citizens, to protect the painting of Madonna, hid it on a little wagon. They then destroyed the wagon to keep the Saracens from taking the painting. \nDifferent hypotheses are attributed to the name of \"Madonna della Bruna\": the first says that the noun derives from the Lombard high-medieval term \"br\u00f9nja\" (armor/protection of knights). So the name might mean \"Madonna of defense\". Another hypothesis is that the name comes from \"herbon\", a city of Giudea, where the Virgin went to visit her cousin Elisabetta. A third hypothesis says that the name comes from the colour of the Virgin's face. The profane insertions such as the \"navalis\" wagon and its violent destruction, along with the intimacy and the religious solemnity, suggest this festival shares roots with ancient traditions of other Mediterranean countries. For example, in Greek culture, wedding parties also celebrate with a triumphal wagon (\"ships on wheels\" richly designed). The Madonna's sculpture is located in a case in the transept of the cathedral dedicated to her, where there is also a fresco that portrays her. It dates back to the thirteenth century and it belongs to the Byzantine school.\nTransportation.\nMatera is the terminal station of the Bari\u2013Matera, a narrow gauge railroad managed by Ferrovie Appulo Lucane. The nearest airport is Bari Airport.\nMatera is connected to the A14 Bologna-Taranto motorway through the SS99 national road. It is also served by the SS407, SS665 and SS106 national road.\nBus connection to Italy's main cities is provided by private firms.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nMatera is twinned with:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He reached as far as Novaya Zemlya and the Kara Sea in his first two voyages, but was turned back on both occasions by ice. During a third expedition, the crew discovered Spitsbergen and Bear Island, but subsequently became stranded on Novaya Zemlya for almost a year. Barentsz died on the return voyage in 1597.\nThe Barents Sea, among many other places, is named after him.\nLife and career.\nWillem Barentsz was born around 1550 in the village Formerum on the island Terschelling in the Seventeen Provinces, present-day Netherlands. \"Barentsz\" was not his surname but rather his patronymic name, short for \"Barentszoon\" \"Barent's son\".\nA cartographer by trade, Barentsz sailed to Spain and the Mediterranean to complete an atlas of the Mediterranean region, which he co-published with Petrus Plancius.\nHis career as an explorer was spent searching for a Northeast passage in order to trade with China. He reasoned clear, open water north of Siberia must exist since the sun shone 24 hours a day melting Arctic sea ice, indeed he thought the farther north one went the less ice there would be.\nFirst voyage.\nOn 5 June 1594, Barentsz left the island of Texel aboard the small ship \"Mercury\", as part of a group of three ships sent out in separate directions to try to enter the Kara Sea, with the hopes of finding the Northeast Passage above Siberia. Between 23 and 29 June, Barentsz stayed at Kildin Island.\nOn 9 July, the crew encountered a polar bear for the first time. After shooting and wounding it with a musket when it tried to climb aboard the ship, the seamen decided to capture it with the hope of bringing it back to Holland. Once leashed and brought aboard the ship however, the bear rampaged and had to be killed. This occurred in Bear Creek, Williams Island.\nUpon discovering the Orange Islands, the crew came across a herd of approximately 200 walruses and tried to kill them with hatchets and pikes. Finding the task more difficult than they imagined, cold steel shattering against the tough hides of the animals, they left with only a few ivory tusks.\nBarentsz reached the west coast of Novaya Zemlya, and followed it northward before being forced to turn back in the face of large icebergs. Although they did not reach their ultimate goal, the trip was considered a success.\nJan Huyghen van Linschoten was a member of this expedition and the second.\nSecond voyage.\nThe following year, Prince Maurice of Orange was filled with \"the most exaggerated hopes\" on hearing of Barentsz' previous voyage, and named him chief pilot and conductor of a new expedition, which was accompanied by six ships loaded with merchant wares that the Dutch hoped to trade with China.\nSetting out on 2 June 1595, the voyage went between the Siberian coast and Vaygach Island. On 30 August, the party came across approximately 20 Samoyed \"wild men\" with whom they were able to speak, due to a crewmember speaking their language. 4 September saw a small crew sent to States Island to search for a type of crystal that had been noticed earlier. The party was attacked by a polar bear, and two sailors were killed.\nEventually, the expedition turned back upon discovering that unexpected weather had left the Kara Sea frozen. This expedition was largely considered to be a failure.\nThird voyage.\nIn 1596, disappointed by the failure of previous expeditions, the States-General announced they would no longer subsidize similar voyages \u2013 but instead offered a high reward for anybody who \"successfully\" navigated the Northeast Passage. The Town Council of Amsterdam purchased and outfitted two small ships, captained by Jan Rijp and Jacob van Heemskerk, to search for the elusive channel under the command of Barentsz. They set off on 10 May or 15 May, and on 9 June discovered Bear Island.\nThey discovered Spitsbergen on 17 June, sighting its northwest coast. On 20 June they saw the entrance of a large bay, later called Raudfjorden. On 21 June they anchored between Cloven Cliff and Vogelsang, where they \"set up a post with the arms of the Dutch upon it.\" On 25 June they entered Magdalenefjorden, which they named \"Tusk Bay\", in light of the walrus tusks they found there. The following day, 26 June, they sailed into the northern entrance of Forlandsundet, but were forced to turn back because of a shoal, which led them to call the fjord \"Keerwyck\" (\"inlet where one is forced to turn back\"). On 28 June they rounded the northern point of Prins Karls Forland, which they named \"Vogelhoek\", on account of the large number of birds they saw there. They sailed south, passing Isfjorden and Bellsund, which were labelled on Barentsz's chart as \"Grooten Inwyck\" and \"Inwyck\".\nThe ships once again found themselves at Bear Island on 1 July, which led to a disagreement between Barentsz and Van Heemskerk on one side and Rijp on the other. They agreed to part ways, with Barentsz continuing northeast, while Rijp headed due north in an attempt to cross directly over the north pole to reach China. Barentsz reached Novaya Zemlya on 17 July. Anxious to avoid becoming entrapped in the surrounding ice, he intended to head for the Vaigatch Strait, but their ship became stuck within the many icebergs and floes. Stranded, the 16-man crew was forced to spend the winter on a barren bluff. After a failed attempt to melt the permafrost, the crew used driftwood and lumber from the ship to build a 7.8\u00d75.5-metre lodge they called \"Het Behouden Huys\" (The Saved House).\nDealing with extreme cold, the crew realised that their socks would burn before their feet could even feel the warmth of a fire \u2013 and took to sleeping with warmed stones and cannonballs. They used the merchant fabrics aboard the ship to make additional blankets and clothing. The ship bore salted beef, butter, cheese, bread, barley, peas, beans, groats, flour, oil, vinegar, mustard, salt, beer, wine, brandy, hardtack, smoked bacon, ham and fish. Much of the beer froze, bursting the casks. By 8 November Gerrit de Veer, the ship's carpenter who kept a diary, reported a shortage of beer and bread, with wine being rationed four days later.\nIn January 1597, the crew became the first to witness and record the atmospheric anomaly of a polar mirage, now coined the Novaya Zemlya effect due to this sighting.\nProving somewhat successful at hunting, the group caught Arctic foxes in primitive traps. The raw flesh of the Arctic fox contains small amounts of vitamin C, which, unknown to the sailors, reduced the effects of scurvy. The crew were continually attacked by polar bears that infested the area where they camped. The bears turned the stranded and now empty ship into a wintertime abode. Primitive guns usually did not kill the bears on first or even second shot (unless well aimed at the heart) and were difficult to aim, while the cold and brittle metal weapons often shattered or bent.\nBy June, the ice had still not loosened its grip on the ship, and the remaining desperate scurvy-ridden survivors took two open boats. Barentsz died at sea soon after on 20 June 1597. It is not known whether Barentsz was buried on the northern island of Novaya Zemlya, or at sea. It took seven more weeks for the boats to reach the Kola Peninsula, where they were rescued by a Dutch merchant vessel commanded by former fellow explorer Jan Rijp who by that time had returned to the Netherlands and was on a second voyage, assuming the Barentsz crew to be lost, and found it by accident. By that time, only 12 crewmen remained. They did not reach Amsterdam until 1 November. Sources differ on whether two men died on the ice floe and three in the boats, or three on the ice floe and two in the boats. The young cabin boy had died during the winter months in the shelter.\nExcavation and findings.\nThe wooden lodge where Barentsz' crew sheltered was found undisturbed by Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen in 1871. Making a sketch of the lodge's construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a tool chest, clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod and a number of pictures. Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a grappling iron, two maps and a handwritten translation of Arthur Pet and Charles Jackman's voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam, after some had initially been held in The Hague.\nThe amateur archaeologist Miloradovich's 1933 finds are held in the Arctic and Antarctic Museum in St. Petersburg.

Consisting of several hundred mostly Irish and other Catholic European expatriates and immigrants, including numerous men who had deserted or defected from the United States Army, the battalion was formed and led by Irishman John Riley. It served as an artillery unit for much of the war, and despite later being formally designated as an infantry unit of two companies, the battalion continued to operate artillery pieces throughout the conflict. The participated in many of the bloodiest battles during the American invasion of Mexico, with Ulysses S. Grant remarking that \"Churubusco proved to be about the severest battle fought in the valley of Mexico\".\nComposed primarily of Irish immigrants, the battalion also included German, Canadian, English, French, Italian, Polish, Scottish, Spanish, Swiss and Mexican soldiers, most of whom were Catholic. Several native-born Americans were in the ranks, including fugitive slaves from the Southern United States. Only a few members of the battalion were U.S. citizens. The Mexican government printed propaganda in different languages to entice immigrants serving in the United States Army to switch sides and offered incentives to foreigners who would enlist in its army, including being granted citizenship, being paid higher wages and generous land grants. U.S. Army regiments which had members defect included the 1st Artillery, the 2nd Artillery, the 3rd Artillery, the 4th Artillery, the 2nd Dragoons, the 2nd Infantry, the 3rd Infantry, the 4th Infantry, the 5th Infantry, the 6th Infantry, the 7th Infantry and the 8th Infantry. The are honored by Mexican and Irish people.\nHistorical perspective.\nFor those Mexicans who had fought in the Mexican\u2013American War and for generations to come after, the were heroes who came to their aid in an hour of need. For Americans, the were traitors, fighting in an unjust attempt by Mexico to reconquer Texas. Successive Mexican presidents have praised the ; Vicente Fox Quesada stated that, \"The affinities between Ireland and Mexico go back to the first years of our nation, when our country fought to preserve its national sovereignty... Then, a brave group of Irish soldiers... in a heroic gesture, decided to fight against the foreign ground invasion\", and Mexican president Ernesto Zedillo stated \"Members of the St. Patrick's Battalion were executed for following their consciences. They were martyred for adhering to the highest ideals... we honor their memory. In the name of the people of Mexico, I salute today the people of Ireland and express my eternal gratitude\".\nMotivations.\nThe great majority of those men who formed Saint Patrick's Battalion were recent immigrants who had arrived at northeastern U.S. ports. They were part of the Irish diaspora then escaping the Great Irish Famine and extremely poor economic conditions in Ireland, which was at the time part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The U.S. Army often recruited the Irish and other immigrants into military service shortly or sometimes immediately after arrival in America in coffin ships with promises of salaries and land after the war.\nNumerous theories have been proposed as to their motives for desertion, including cultural alienation, mistreatment of immigrant soldiers by nativist soldiers and senior officers, brutal military discipline and dislike of service in the U.S. military, being forced to attend Protestant church services and being unable to practice their Catholic religion freely as well as religious ideological convictions, the incentive of higher wages and land grants starting at offered by Mexico, and viewing the U.S. invasion of Mexico as unjust.\nIt is believed primary motivations were shared religion with the Mexicans and sympathy for the Mexican cause based on similarities between the situations in Mexico and Ireland. This hypothesis is based on evidence of the number of Irish Catholics in the battalion, the letters of John Riley, and the field entries of senior officers. Irish immigrants had been faced with animosity both as a result of their Catholic faith and ethnicity. Catholic immigrants were regularly met with discrimination from their Protestant peers, sentiments which sometimes boiled over into events such as the Philadelphia nativist riots against Irish Catholic immigrants. Catholic churches had been similarly defaced by the American military in Mexico during the war. Additionally, both the Mexicans and the Irish were subjected to racism and xenophobia based on 'scientific racism' and treated as inferior to American nativists.\nAnother hypothesis is that the members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion had been unhappy with their treatment in the U.S. Army; this was the conviction of George Ballentine, an Englishman who served in the American army. Ballentine stated that while \"there was a portion of truth\" in the view\u2014commonly assigned by officers\u2014that the deserters joined the Mexican army due to their Catholicism; he said, \"I have good reason to believe, in fact in some cases I know, that harsh and unjust treatment by their officers operated far more strongly than any other consideration to produce the deplorable result [desertion],\" and described how he found the punishments used for \"trivial offensives\" to be \"revolting and disgusting\". Another theory some historians hold is that the soldiers were attracted by the incentives offered by the Mexican government: safe passage throughout Mexico for deserters, generous land grants, and the offer of potential military commissions. For poor people coming from famine conditions, economics was often an important incentive.\nMexican author Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Conseco noted that many Irish lived in northern Texas, and were forced to move south due to regional insecurity. Mainly Irish settlers from San Patricio, Texas, had previously sided with Mexican forces against Texan rebels at the Battle of Lipantitl\u00e1n in the Texan Revolution.\nIrish expatriates had a long tradition of serving as mercenaries in the military forces of Catholic countries, including in European countries after the Williamite War. In the decades leading up to the Mexican-American War many Irish fought in the South American wars of independence.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[c]\nService as a military unit.\nFormation and early engagements.\nPresent in the Mexican Army for the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma were the \"Legi\u00f3n de Extranjeros\" (Legion of Foreigners); the men who would later make up the core of the Saint Patrick's battalion. Meanwhile, deserters were abandoning General Taylor's army on the Rio Grande. Riley and \"a company of 48 Irishmen\" manned Mexican artillery at the Siege of Fort Texas, which took place concurrently to the two other battles. Martin Tritschler, German Mexican and a Captain at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, is attributed with convincing a large number of German soldiers to defect from the U.S. occupying forces in Puebla, Puebla.\nThe first major engagement of the Saint Patrick's Battalion, as a recognised Mexican unit, was as an artillery battery in the Battle of Monterrey of 21 September 1846. Popularly they were called \"Los Colorados\" by the Mexicans because of their ruddy, sun-burnt complexions and red hair color. They were commanded by John Riley,&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;[b] an Irishman who had previously served in the British Army as a non-commissioned officer and possibly arrived in Canada in 1843 whilst serving in his British unit (the assertion that Riley was a sergeant in the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot is known to be inaccurate). Riley went on to join the U.S. Army in Michigan in September 1845. He deserted in Matamoros in April 1846. Upon meeting Mexican forces he was initially given the Officer rank of Lieutenant by General Pedro de Ampudia.\nAt the battle of Monterrey the proved their artillery skills by causing the deaths of many American soldiers, and they are credited with defeating two to three separate assaults into the heart of the city. Among their targets were companies led by such officers as Braxton Bragg, many of whose soldiers would end up in their own ranks later in the war. Their tenacity, however, did not affect the Mexican commanders' decision to capitulate and abandon the position.\nFollowing the engagement at Monterrey, the grew in number, by some estimates reaching an enlistment of over 700 men. Forces re-assembled at San Luis Potos\u00ed and they had their distinct green silk flag embroidered there.\nBuena Vista.\nThey then marched northward after joining a larger force commanded by Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna sent from Mexico City, the \"liberating army of the North\". At the Battle of Buena Vista (known as the battle of Angostura in Mexico) in Coahuila on 23 February, the Patricios became engaged with U.S. forces. They were assigned the three heaviest\u201418 and 24 pound\u2014cannons the Mexican army possessed, which were positioned on high ground overlooking the battlefield, at the base of a hillside (just below what is now a gravel mine). They were later described as \"a strong Mexican battery ... moved ... by dint of extraordinary exertions ... [that] commanded the entire plateau\".\nThey started the battle supporting Mexican infantry by firing on U.S. lines as the Mexicans advanced on them, then later decimating an artillery battery directly opposite them on the battlefield (Washington's 4th Artillery, D Battery). A small number of were dispatched with a division commanded by Manuel Lombardini with the express purpose of capturing the 4th's cannons once the crews had been dealt with. As the division got close enough they charged the artillery battery, bayoneting whoever remained and routing the rest, leaving the attached free to haul away two six-pound cannons. These cannons would later be used by Mexican forces at the Battle of Contreras.\nIn frustration U.S. Commander Zachary Taylor, referring to the Saint Patrick's Battalion, ordered a squadron of the 1st Dragoons to \"take that damned battery\". In this task they failed, and, badly bloodied, were forced to retreat. At about 1 p.m. the covered a Mexican retreat as a disordered mass of infantry sought refuge during a lull in the fighting. The rode out the day in a costly artillery duel with several American batteries, which killed or injured roughly one third of them. General Francisco Mejia's Battle Report for Buena Vista described the ' as \"worthy of the most consummate praise because the men fought with daring bravery.\" Several Irishmen were awarded the War Cross by the Mexican government for their conduct in that battle, and many received field promotions.\nRe-organization and final battles.\nDespite their excellent performance in a number of engagements as artillery, the much-reduced were ordered to muster a larger infantry battalion, as well as a cavalry unit, in mid-1847 by personal order of Santa Anna. It was renamed the Foreign Legion of Patricios and consisted of volunteers from many European countries, commanded by Col. Francisco R. Moreno, with Riley in charge of 1st company and Santiago O'Leary heading up the second. Desertion handbills were produced, specially targeting Catholic Irish, French and German immigrants in the invading U.S. army and stating that \"You must not fight against a religious people, nor should you be seen in the ranks of those who proclaim slavery of mankind as a constitutive principle ... liberty is not on the part of those who desire to be lords of the world, robbing properties and territories which do not belong to them and shedding so much blood in order to accomplish their views, views in open war to the principles of our holy religion\".\nThe Battle of Churubusco (20 August 1847) took place about four months after the defeat at Cerro Gordo. Gen. Santa Anna gave a verbal order to \"preserve the point at all risk\". The San Patricio Companies initially met the attackers outside the walls of the convent at a t\u00eate-de-pont, which was about from a fortified convent. A battery of three to five heavy cannons were used from this position to hold off the American advance along with support from \"Los Independencia Batall\u00f3n\" and \"Los Bravos Batall\u00f3n\". The Americans were under the command of Col. William Hoffman. Several U.S. charges towards the bridgehead were thrown off, with the companies serving as an example to the supporting battalions. Unlike the , most of whom were veterans (many having served in the armies of the United Kingdom and various German states), the supporting Mexican battalions were simply militia (the term 'National Guard' is also used) who had been untested by battle.\nA lack of ammunition led the Mexican soldiers in the trenches between the bridgehead and the convent to disband; without ammunition, they had no way to fight back. Santa Anna had ordered half of these soldiers to a different part of the battlefield. When the requested ammunition wagon finally arrived, the 9 \u00bd drachm cartridges were compatible with none but the San Patricio Companies \"Brown Bess\" muskets, and they made up only a fraction of the defending forces. Further hampering Mexican efforts, a stray spark from an artillery piece firing grapeshot at the on-coming U.S. troops caused the just-arrived ammunition to explode and set fire to several men, including Captain O'Leary and Gen. Anaya. A withdrawal behind the walls of the \"convento de Churubusco\" was called when the threat of being outflanked proved too great.\nThe used this battle as a chance to settle old scores with U.S. troops: \"The large number of officers killed in the affair was\u00a0... ascribed to them, as for the gratification of their revenge they aimed at no other objects during the engagement\". At some point during the fighting for the convent, two American officers led fifteen men against a point in the Mexican defenses, and mistook members for friendly U.S. army troops; the opened fire on them, killing or wounding all but one of the group. Though hopelessly outnumbered and under-equipped, the defenders repelled the attacking U.S. forces with heavy losses until their ammunition ran out and a Mexican officer raised the white flag of surrender. Officer Patrick Dalton of the tore the white flag down, prompting Gen. Pedro Anaya to order his men to fight on, with their bare hands if necessary. American Private Ballentine reported that when the Mexicans attempted to raise the white flag two more times, members of the shot and killed them. After brutal close-quarters fighting with bayonets and sabers through the halls and rooms inside the convent, U.S. Army Captain James M. Smith suggested a surrender after raising his white handkerchief. Following the U.S. victory, the Americans \"ventilat[ed] their vocabulary of Saxon expletives, not very \"courteously\", on Riley and his beautiful disciples of St. Patrick.\"\nGen. Anaya stated in his written battle report that 35 were killed, 85 taken prisoner (including a wounded John Riley, Captain O'Leary, and Anaya); about 85 escaped with retreating Mexican forces. Some 60% of the were killed or captured in the engagement. The survivors were reformed before the Battle of Mexico City some two weeks later and were stationed at Quer\u00e9taro where the Mexican government had decamped, with some 50 members serving as a body-guard for the commander-in-chief. The battalion were caught up in the infighting and politicking of Mexico at the time, and were under the patronage of a faction that favored suing for ending of the conflict peacefully. New units were later made up of the free survivors of the battle of Churubusco and a roughly equal number of fresh deserters from the U.S. Army. Following the war, the Mexican Government insisted in a clause of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that the remaining prisoners held by the Americans were to be left in Mexico, and Major General William Orlando Butler issued General Orders 116 on 1 June 1848 stating that; \"The prisoners confined at the Citadel, known as the prisoners, will be immediately discharged\"\u2014Rogue's March was played upon their release. The Saint Patrick's Battalion continued to function as two infantry companies under the command of John Riley, with one unit tasked with sentry duty in Mexico City and the other was stationed in the suburbs of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The were officially mustered out of Mexican military service in 1848; some members were alleged to have been involved in an abortive military coup, while historians have said the group was disbanded because of Mexican budget cuts.\nAftermath of Churubusco.\nTrials.\nThe captured by the U.S. Army were treated and punished as traitors for desertion in time of war. Seventy-two men were immediately charged with desertion by the Army.\nTwo separate courts-martial were held, one at Tacubaya on 23 August, and another at San \u00c1ngel on 26 August. At neither of these trials were the men represented by lawyers nor were transcripts made of the proceedings. This lack of formal legal advice could account for the fact that several of the men claimed that drunkenness had led them to desert (a common defense in military trials at the time that sometimes led to lighter sentences), and others described how they were forced to join the Mexican Army in some form or another. The majority of the either offered no defense or their defenses were not recorded. Wealthy Mexicans came to the ' defence at the trials, and members of Mexico's first families visited them in prison.\nSentences.\nOne soldier who claimed he was forced to fight by the Mexicans after he was captured by them, and who subsequently refused to do so, was sentenced to death by firing squad instead of hanging, along with another who was found not to have officially joined the Mexican Army.\nMost of the convicted were sentenced to death by hanging: 30 from the Tacubaya trial and 18 from San \u00c1ngel. The rationale was that they had entered Mexican military service following the declaration of war. Execution by hanging was in violation of the contemporary Articles of War, which stipulated that the penalty for desertion and/or defecting to the enemy during a time of war was death by firing squad, regardless of the circumstances. Hanging was reserved only for spies (without uniform) and for \"atrocities against civilians\", neither of which activities were among the charges brought against any members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. Although more than 9,000 U.S. soldiers deserted the army during the Mexican\u2013American War, only the (who unlike almost all other deserters had also fought against the United States) were punished by hanging.\nThose soldiers who had left military service before the official declaration of war on Mexico (Riley among them) were sentenced to \"... receive 50 lashes on their bare backs, to be branded with the letter 'D' for deserter, and to wear iron yokes around their necks for the duration of the war.\" This, too, went against the Articles of War; deserters who left prior to a declaration of war were supposed to be branded, scourged, \"or\" sentenced to hard labor. The \"San Patricios\" instead received all three punishments, a fate that once again was given to no other deserters during the war.\nExecutions.\nIn all, 50 Saint Patrick's Battalion members were officially executed by the U.S. Army, all but two by hanging. Collectively, this was the largest mass execution in United States history. (The hanging of 38 Sioux at the conclusion of the Dakota War of 1862 appears to have been the largest execution by hanging at a single event.) En masse executions for treason took place at three separate locations on three separate dates; 16 were executed on 10 September 1847 at San \u00c1ngel, four were executed the following day at the village of Mixcoac on 11 September, and 30 were hanged at Chapultepec on 13 September. One was murdered by American soldiers when he was recognised among the prisoners of war in the aftermath of the Battle of Molino del Rey, by being thrown \"into a mill flume and crushed by the wheel\". \nAt the San \u00c1ngel hangings all prisoners were executed without incident except for Patrick Dalton, who, as an American captain described, was \"literally choked to death\". Dalton had previously voiced concerns regarding his treatment.\nBy order of Gen. Winfield Scott, thirty were to be executed at Chapultepec in full view of the two armies while they fought the Battle of Chapultepec, at the precise moment that the flag of the U.S. replaced the flag of Mexico atop the citadel. This order was carried out by Col. William Harney. Harney was taunted and jeered by the condemned men. \nWhile overseeing the hangings, Harney ordered Francis O'Connor hanged although he had had both legs amputated the previous day. When the army surgeon informed the colonel that the absent soldier had lost both his legs in battle, Harney replied: \"Bring the damned son of a bitch out! My order was to hang 30 and by God I'll do it!\"\nThe U.S. flag appeared on the flagpole at 9.30 a.m. Legend has it that the Mexican flag had been taken by a cadet, Juan Escutia of the Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes, who leapt with it to his death from Chapultepec Castle to deny the Americans the honor of capturing it. In a final act of defiance, the men about to be hanged cheered the Mexican flag, as one onlooker remarked; \"Hands tied, feet tied, their voices still free\". At Harney's signal, the carts holding the tied and noosed men pulled away. Harney refused to cut the bodies down, stating that \"I was ordered to have them hanged, and have no orders to \"unhang\" them\". Harney was subsequently promoted to brigadier general, which rank he held while the U.S. Army occupied Mexico City.\nThe Mexican government described the hangings as \"a cruel death or horrible torments, improper in a civilized age, and [ironic] for a people who aspire to the title of illustrious and humane\", and by a writer covering the war as \"a refinement of cruelty and ... fiendish\". George Ballentine remarked, in his account of his American military service in Mexico, \"[T]he desertion of our soldiers to the Mexican army ... were still numerous, in spite of the fearful example of the executions at Churubusco, [and] also served to inspire that party with hope.\" \nLegacy.\nThose who survived either made lives for themselves in Mexico or returned to their home nations such as Ireland. Some former found work at the arsenal in Guadalajara making gun stocks. One former , an Irishman, started a military academy teaching \"the sword exercise\", also in Guadalajara. Others were reportedly killed while travelling through Mexico, while others were reduced to living on handouts. A handful are on record as having made use of the land claims promised them by the Mexican government. Americans in Mexico who had been taken prisoner by Mexico or who were common deserters were known to falsely present themselves as members of the Saint Patrick's Battalion; American William W. Carpenter, who found himself in this predicament, stated that: \"the reputation of the San Patricio battalion was spread from ocean to ocean, and to that, more than any thing else, do I owe my present safety\".\nThe men have continued to be honored and revered as heroes in Mexico. The is memorialised on two separate days; 12 September, the generally accepted anniversary of the executions of those battalion members captured by the U.S. Army, and 17 March, Saint Patrick's Day. Numerous schools, churches and other landmarks in Mexico take their name from the battalion, including:\nIn the U.S., the memory of the battalion has been different. In Winfield Scott's 1852 run for President of the United States, his treatment of the was brought up by his opponents to sway Irish American voters. The U.S. Army long denied the existence of the Saint Patrick's Battalion, as a cover-up and an attempt to discourage other deserters. In 1915, an inquiry was initiated by U.S. congressmen William Henry Coleman and Frank L. Greene. This resulted in the U.S. Army's admitting its denial of the matter. The U.S. Congress ordered the army to turn over its records on the battalion to the National Archives. In 1999, MGM cancelled the U.S. distribution of a film depicting the battalion, \"One Man's Hero\". The \"San Patricios\" are rarely covered in American education; on the rare occasion that they are mentioned, it is pointed out that they were traitors (if holding US citizenship), and small in number. Reasons given for having abandoned the United States included religious sympathy, and pursuit of money and land.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPreferring to fight with the Catholic Mexicans against the Protestant Americans, the San Patricios were the only group of deserters in American history to band together in the service of a foreign enemy.\n\u2013Peter Quinn, \"Looking for Jimmy: A Search for Irish America\"\nIn 1997, President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo commemorated the 150th anniversary of the execution of the at a ceremony in Mexico City's San Jacinto Plaza. This is where the U.S. Army conducted the first 16 hangings after the men were convicted of desertion at court martial. Ireland and Mexico jointly issued commemorative postage stamps to mark the anniversary.\nIn 2004, at an official ceremony attended by numerous international dignitaries, including directors Lance and Jason Hool and several actors from the film \"One Man's Hero\", the Mexican government gave a commemorative statue to the Irish government in perpetual thanks for the bravery, honor and sacrifice of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. The statue was erected in the town of Clifden, Connemara, Ireland, where leader John Riley was born. Clifden flies the Mexican flag in honor of Riley every year on 12 September. In 2014, Sinn F\u00e9in named a in Clifden in honor of Reilly.\nThe battalion has inspired numerous responses: it is the name of an supporters's association of the association football team Club Deportivo Chivas USA. The unit was evoked in a Saint Patrick's Day message from Subcomandante Marcos of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, The have been remembered as a symbol of international solidarity with Mexico.\nFlag.\nThere are conflicting accounts of the design of the flag of the Saint Patrick's Battalion. No flags or depictions of them are known to have survived to the present day. The only version of the flag known to have survived the war was subsequently lost or stolen from the chapel at West Point.\nJohn Riley, who left an account of the battalion, noted the flag in a letter:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In all my letter, I forgot to tell you under what banner we fought so bravely. It was that glorious Emblem of native rights, that being the banner which should have floated over our native Soil many years ago, it was St. Patrick, the Harp of Erin, the Shamrock upon a green field.\nAccording to George Wilkins Kendall, an American journalist covering the war with Mexico:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The banner is of green silk, and on one side is a harp, surmounted by the Mexican coat of arms, with a scroll on which is painted [Liberty for the Mexican Republic]. Under the harp is the motto of On the other side is a painting ... made to represent St. Patrick, in his left hand a key and in his right a crook or staff resting upon a serpent. Underneath is painted .\nTwo other eye-witness accounts of the flag exist, both from American soldiers. The first describes it as:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...\u00a0a beautiful green silk banner [which] waved over their heads; on it glittered a silver cross and a golden harp, embroidered by the hands of the fair nuns of San Luis Potos\u00ed. \u2014\u200a\nThe second notes only:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the mighty host we passed was O'Reilly [\"sic\"] and his company of deserters bearing aloft in high disgrace the holy banner of St. Patrick.\u2014\u200a\nA radically different version of the flag was described in a Mexican source:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;They had a white flag/standard, on which were found the shields of Ireland and Mexico, and the name of their captain, John O'Reilly [\"sic\"] embroidered in green.\nWhatever the case, in 1997 a reproduction military flag was created by the Clifden and Connemara Heritage Group. Another was created the following year for the MGM film \"One Man's Hero\", a romanticised version of the ' history. A third version embodying the description of the San Luis Potos\u00ed flag was made for the Irish Society of Chicago, which hung it in the city's Union League Club.\nSome writers suggest that the Saint Patrick's Battalion might have used different banners (as an artillery unit, as an infantry company, and as a reconstructed unit).\nMusic.\nA number of musical works have covered the battalion, including:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\na. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;^ The coats were Turkish-blue with yellow lapels and crimson-red cuffs as well as piping.

For his actions, when the 442nd was part of the 92d Infantry Division, he was the only Japanese American to be awarded the Medal of Honor during or immediately after World War II.\nEarly life.\nMunemori was born in Los Angeles, California to Japanese immigrant parents Kametaro and Nawa Munemori. He was a \"Nisei\", a second generation Japanese American. He grew up in the suburb of Glendale and graduated from Abraham Lincoln Senior High School in 1940 before becoming an auto mechanic.\nSoldier.\nMunemori had volunteered for the U.S. Army in November 1941, one month before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and he was inducted in February 1942. Along with all other Japanese American soldiers, he was soon after demoted to 4-C class, removed from combat training and assigned to menial labor. While he was transferred to a series of Midwestern and Southern army bases (eventually winding up at Camp Savage, Minnesota), his parents and siblings were incarcerated at Manzanar.\nWhen Japanese American soldiers were allowed to reenter active service in March 1943, Munemori volunteered to be part of the all-\"Nisei\" 442nd Regimental Combat Team. This segregated army unit was made up entirely of Japanese Americans, with most initial recruits coming from Hawaii. The unit began as the 100th Infantry, initially listed as a separate battalion, and fought as part of the 133rd Infantry Regiment within the 34th Infantry Division. After the Allied capture of Rome, the battalion withdrew from the front and became the 1st Battalion of the 442nd RCT. Munemori was sent to Camp Shelby in January 1944 and, after completing his combat training three months later, joined the 100th Battalion in the European Theater. Fighting in Italy and France, he participated in the rescue of the Lost Battalion before arriving on the Gothic Line, where he was killed in action saving the lives of two of his comrades.\nIn 1990s, the awards issued to 442nd soldiers were reviewed after two studies revealed that racial discrimination had caused some to be overlooked, and twenty-one soldiers' Distinguished Service Crosses were upgraded to Medals of Honor.\nAwards and decorations.\nSadao \"Spud\" Munemori received these awards during World War II:\nMedal of Honor citation.\nRank and organization: Private First Class, U.S. Army, Company A, 100th Infantry Battalion, 442d Combat Team.

The mission was named after San Luis, obispo de Tolosa (Saint Louis, bishop of Toulouse, France).\nThe Mission of San Luis Obispo is unusual in its design, in that its combination of belfry and vestibule are found nowhere else among the California missions. Like other churches, the main nave is short and narrow, but at the San Luis Obispo Mission, there is a secondary nave of almost equal size situated to the right of the altar, making it the only L-shaped mission church in California.\nHistory.\nFounding of the mission (1772).\nIn 1769, Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 traveled through California on his way to the Bay of Monterey and traveled through the San Luis Obispo area. Expedition diarist and Franciscan missionary Juan Cresp\u00ed wrote that the soldiers called the place \"llano de los osos\", or the \"plain of the bears\". Portola followed the same route the following year, on his way to establish the Presidio of Monterey. Missionary president Jun\u00edpero Serra, traveling by sea, met the Portola party there and founded San Carlos Borremeo, in Monterey, which was moved to Carmel the following year.\nWhen food supplies started to dwindle at the mission, Serra remembered the stories of the \"valley of the bears.\" He decided to send a hunting expedition to San Luis Obispo to help feed the Spanish and neophytes (natives that converted to Christianity) in Monterey. The success of the hunting expedition caused Jun\u00edpero Serra to consider building a mission in that area. Upon further investigation, he was convinced that San Luis Obispo would be a perfect site for a mission, based on its surplus of natural resources, good weather and the Chumash, a local Native American tribe who could be used as labor, often by means of enslavement. The mission became the fifth in the mission chain founded by Father Jun\u00edpero Serra. Serra himself was known for intimidating and controlling native subjects, and once baptized, the Chumash were not allowed to leave the missions, nor were the generations to follow.\nFather Serra sent an expedition down south to San Luis Obispo to start building the mission, and on September 1, 1772, a cross was erected near San Luis Obispo Creek and Serra celebrated the first mass. Following the first mass, Father Jun\u00edpero Serra left the responsibility of construction to Father Jos\u00e9 Cavaller. The mission was to be named after San Luis, obispo de Tolosa, a saint that is popular within the Franciscan order. Father Cavaller used Chumash labor in building the palisades, which would serve as temporary buildings for the mission. Native American tribes set these buildings ablaze in an act of resistance against European colonization. The buildings were rebuilt using adobe and tile structures.\nBeginning in 1794 Mission San Luis Obispo went through extensive building operations. Buildings to accommodate the nearby Native Americans and many improvements to the mission, including storerooms, residences for single women, soldiers barracks and mills were added. The renovation was finished after completion of the quadrangle in 1819, and celebrated a year later by the arrival of two mission bells from Lima, Peru. The arrival of the bells marked the end of improvements made to Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa for many years. In 1830 Father Luis Gil y Taboada took over the mission, but he died three years later. In 1842, the death of Father Ramon Abella marked the last Franciscan at the mission for the next 40 years.\nRancho period (1834\u20131849).\nIn 1845, Governor P\u00edo Pico sold the San Luis Obispo Mission to Captain John Wilson for $510. John C. Fr\u00e9mont and his \"California Battalion\" used the mission as a base of operations during their war with Mexico in 1846 (see Bear Flag Revolt). The mission fell to ruins during the period of secularization and the priests who were left would rent out rooms to help support the mission.\nCalifornia statehood (since 1850).\nThe Mission San Lu\u00eds Obispo de Tolosa became the first courthouse and jail in San Luis Obispo County, California. In 1850, when California became a part of the United States, the first California bishop, Joseph Alemany, petitioned the Government to return some of the mission lands back to the Church. Since then, it has undergone major civic, political and structural changes. In the 1880s, the front portico and bell loft were removed when weakened by an earthquake. An attempt was made to \"modernize\" the structures, and the colonnades along the front of the convento wing were razed and the Church and residence were covered with wooden clapboard. A New England\u2013style belfry was added. The changes protected the structure from further decay, although significantly altering the facade of the buildings. In the 1930s, during the pastorship of Fr. John Harnett, the buildings underwent extensive restoration to transform them back to early mission style. The 1893 annex was extended in 1948. The mission is the center of the busy downtown area, and functions as a Catholic parish church for the City of San Luis Obispo in the Diocese of Monterey.\nMission plaza.\nIn 1970 the Mission was recognized as the center of the City of San Luis Obispo, with the dedication of Mission Plaza. Mayor Ken Schwartz worked with students from Cal Poly to develop a plan to convince voters to close Monterey Street in front of the mission. Construction of a plaza began in 1969 and the plaza was dedicated in 1970. A statue of Jun\u00edpero Serra was installed on the grounds facing the public Mission Plaza. The attention to the statues of Jun\u00edpero Serra expanded during the George Floyd protests to include monuments of individuals associated with the controversy over the genocide of indigenous peoples in the Americas. The statue was moved into storage on the grounds in 2020.\nThe plaza in front of the mission often serves as a location for demonstrations and protests in the San Luis Obispo county.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tilden", "text": "Governor of New York from 1875 to 1876\nSamuel Jones Tilden (February 9, 1814 \u2013 August 4, 1886) was an American politician who served as the 25th governor of New York and was the Democratic nominee in the disputed 1876 United States presidential election.\nTilden was born in 1814 into a wealthy family in New Lebanon, New York. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Martin Van Buren. After studying at Yale University and New York University School of Law, Tilden began a legal career in New York City, becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the New York State Assembly and helped launch Van Buren's candidacy in the 1848 United States presidential election. A War Democrat who opposed slavery, Tilden opposed Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election, but later supported him and the Union during the Civil War. Afterward, he became the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee and managed Horatio Seymour's campaign in the 1868 presidential election.\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's Tammany Hall faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss William M. Tweed's rampant corruption. Tilden won election as governor of New York in 1874, and in that office, he helped break up the Canal Ring. His battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in New York, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the party's nominee on the second ballot. In the general election, Tilden faced Republican nominee Rutherford B. Hayes. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the gold standard, and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending Reconstruction in the Southern United States.\nTilden won the popular vote by 250,000 votes but 20 electoral votes were in dispute, leaving Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the electoral vote. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan Electoral Commission to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Commission, and decided in a series of party-line rulings that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the Compromise of 1877, Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden is the only presidential candidate to win an absolute majority of the popular vote while losing the election. He subsequently left politics and died in 1886.\nEarly life.\nTilden was born in New Lebanon, New York, the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden. He was descended from Nathaniel Tilden, an early English settler who came to North America in 1634. His father and other family members were the makers of patent medicines including Tilden's Extract, a popular concoction of the 1800s and early 1900s that was derived from cannabis. Tilden's father maintained relationships with many influential New York politicians, including President Martin Van Buren, who became Tilden's political idol. Tilden was frequently in poor health during his youth, and he spent much of his time studying politics and reading works such as \"The Wealth of Nations\". Tilden's health troubles prevented him from regularly attending school, and he dropped out of Williams Academy after three months and Yale College after a single term in 1834\u20131835.\nLikely motivated by a family friendship with Benjamin Franklin Butler, then serving as a professor at New York University School of Law, Tilden enrolled there to resume his studies and continued to attend intermittently from 1838 to 1841. While studying at NYU, Tilden also read law in the office of attorney John W. Edmonds. He was admitted to the bar in 1841 and became a skilled corporate lawyer. Tilden affiliated with the Democratic Party and frequently campaigned on behalf of Van Buren and other Democratic candidates.\nEarly political career.\nIn 1843, Tilden was appointed as New York City's corporation counsel, a reward for his campaign work for Governor William C. Bouck. Tilden handled hundreds of cases on behalf of the city, but was forced out of office in 1844 after New York City elected a Whig mayor. He served as a delegate to the 1844 Democratic National Convention, which rejected Van Buren and nominated James K. Polk for president. At the urging of Governor Silas Wright, Tilden won election to the New York State Assembly. He became a key ally to Wright and helped end the Anti-Rent War by passing a compromise land bill that defused tensions between tenant farmers and their landlords. After serving as a delegate to the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention, Tilden left public office to focus on his legal practice, where he gained a national reputation as a \"financial physician\" for struggling railroads. Tilden's successful legal practice, combined with shrewd investments, made him rich. His success at money management and investing caused many of his friends, relatives, and political allies, including Van Buren, to allow Tilden to manage their finances.\nTilden was a leader of the \"Barnburners\", an anti-slavery faction of the New York Democratic Party that arose during the debate over the Wilmot Proviso. Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the land acquired from Mexico in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. He helped organize the 1848 Free Soil Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the 1848 presidential election drew votes from Democratic nominee Lewis Cass in New York, which played a role in the victory of Whig nominee Zachary Taylor. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the Republican Party in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. In 1855, Tilden was the unsuccessful state attorney general candidate of the \"Soft\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party. In 1859, after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"\nIn the 1860 presidential election, Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee Abraham Lincoln. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war. Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the Union after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Tilden served as the manager of Horatio Seymour's successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the presidential nomination for George B. McClellan at the 1864 Democratic National Convention.\nIn 1867, Tilden received the honorary degree of LL.D. from New York University. He was also chosen as a delegate to that year's state constitutional convention.\nState party leader.\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, Tilden won the election for chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee. He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the 1868 presidential election, but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee Ulysses S. Grant. After the election, Tilden broke with William M. Tweed, the leader of the Tammany Hall political machine. Through bribery, patronage, and control of Irish-American voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York. In 1871, former Tammany associate James O'Brien leaked Tweed's account books to the \"New York Times\". The \"Times\" subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the 1871 state elections, and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected governor of New York in 1874. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"Canal Ring\", a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the New York State Canal System. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of scandals that had come into public view during the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant.\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from Yale University. At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his Bachelor of Arts degree.\nPresidential election of 1876.\nDemocratic nomination.\nBy the time of the June 1876 Democratic National Convention, Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the 1876 presidential election. Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge were so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he had predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes. Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the presidency after four consecutive defeats, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including Thomas F. Bayard, Allen G. Thurman, Thomas A. Hendricks, and General Winfield Scott Hancock.\nDuring the difficult economic times of the Panic of 1873, the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of currency. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the Specie Payment Resumption Act and authorize the printing of more greenbacks, banknotes that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in inflation and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the gold standard) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention (404.5), but fell short of the two-thirds majority (492) required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss John Kelly and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions. Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.\nGeneral election.\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed Abram Hewitt to lead his campaign. The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign. The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration. Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised civil service reform and hard money policies. Meanwhile, Republicans focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion. Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War. For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end Reconstruction and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"unredeemed\" Southern states. Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning African-American voters. Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the Hamburg massacre, in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key swing states, but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states. Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the border states, and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one electoral vote short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana. Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\" Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General George B. McClellan as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.\nPost-election controversy.\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6,000. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states. On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes. On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation\", leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.\nEarly on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes. Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the Post Office violated the United States Constitution. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president. With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that Thomas W. Ferry, a Republican senator from Michigan and the president pro tempore of the United States Senate, could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a contingent election in the United States House of Representatives. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election. In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns. He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.\nElectoral Commission.\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member Electoral Commission to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the Supreme Court of the United States. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice David Davis, a political independent, but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican Joseph P. Bradley, was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission. In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the results. Though some House Democrats hoped to do so, they were unable, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in voting to accept. During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The Compromise of 1877, as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\" Some other historians, including C. Vann Woodward, have argued that the Compromise of 1877 played the decisive role in determining the outcome of the election. On March 2, two days before the end of Grant's term, Congress declared Hayes the victor of the 1876 presidential election. Hayes took office on March 4, and withdrew the last federal soldiers from the South in April 1877, bringing an end to the Reconstruction Era.\nSome Democrats urged Tilden to reject the results and take the presidential oath of office, but Tilden declined to do so. On March 3, the House passed a resolution declaring Tilden the \"duly elected President of the United States,\" but this had no legal effect. Tilden himself stated that, \"I can retire to private life with the consciousness that I shall receive from posterity the credit of having been elected to the highest position in the gift of the people, without any of the cares and responsibilities of the office.\" Tilden was the second individual, after Andrew Jackson in 1824, to lose a presidential election despite winning at least a plurality of the popular vote. Tilden remains the only individual to lose a presidential election while winning an outright majority of the popular vote.\nLater life.\nPotter Committee.\nIn 1878, Democratic Congressman Clarkson Nott Potter convinced the House of Representatives to create a committee to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption in the 1876 election. Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election. Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by Western Union. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. \"New York Herald Tribune\" editor Whitelaw Reid obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency. A congressional committee's investigation into the Cipher Telegrams cleared Tilden of any personal wrongdoing, but the allegations damaged his national standing.\nElections of 1880 and 1884.\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate ahead of the 1880 presidential election. He declined to run for another term as governor in 1879, focusing instead on building support for the 1880 presidential nomination. The revelations of the Potter Committee, along with Tilden's persistent health issues, both damaged Tilden's national standing, but his superior political organization and personal fortune ensured that he remained a serious contender for the Democratic nomination. Tilden's standing with the party slipped further following the Republican victory in the 1879 New York gubernatorial election, where a revitalized Tammany Hall organization split from the regular Democratic party in a patronage dispute with Tilden's faction. In the months before the 1880 Democratic National Convention, rumors about Tilden's intentions circulated wildly, but Tilden refused to definitively state whether or not he would seek the Democratic nomination.\nAs the New York delegation left for the national convention in Cincinnati, Tilden gave a letter to one of his chief supporters, Daniel Manning, suggesting that his health might force him to decline the nomination. Tilden hoped to be nominated, but only if he was the unanimous choice of the convention; if not, Manning was entrusted to make the contents of Tilden's letter available to the New York delegation. The New York delegation interpreted the letter as a notice of withdrawal, and the delegates began looking for a new candidate, eventually settling on Speaker of the House Samuel J. Randall. Ultimately, the party nominated Winfield Scott Hancock, who lost the election to James A Garfield.\nThough many Democrats favored Tilden for the party's nomination in the 1884 presidential election, Tilden once again declined to run due to poor health. He endorsed New York Governor Grover Cleveland, who won the Democratic nomination and went on to defeat James G. Blaine in the general election.\nRetirement and death.\nTilden retired in the early 1880s, living as a near-recluse at his estate, Greystone (now part of Untermyer Park and Gardens) in Yonkers, New York. He died a bachelor at Greystone on August 4, 1886, at the age of 72. He is buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in New Lebanon, Columbia County, New York. In reference to the 1876 election, Tilden's gravestone bears the words, \"I Still Trust The People\".\nOf his fortune, estimated at $7\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024), $4\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) was bequeathed for the establishment and maintenance of a free public library and reading-room in the City of New York; but, as the will was successfully contested by relatives, only about $3\u00a0million (equivalent to $ million in 2024) was applied to its original purpose. In 1895, the Tilden Trust was combined with the Astor and Lenox libraries to found the New York Public Library, and the building bears his name on its front.\nLegacy.\nThe Samuel J. Tilden House at 15 Gramercy Park South, which he owned from 1860 until his death, is now used by the National Arts Club. Tilden's Greystone property is now known as Untermyer Park; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Several places have been named for Tilden, including Tilden, Wisconsin, Tilden, Nebraska, Tilden, Texas, Tilden Township, Pennsylvania, and Grove Park-Tilden Township, Minnesota. The Gov. Samuel J. Tilden Monument was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Other things named for Tilden include Samuel J. Tilden High School, Fort Tilden, New York, and the Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPrimary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Operated by the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the complex was founded in the 18th century by Spanish Catholic missionaries. The mission contains two historic buildings:\nLocated in the Mission District, the mission was founded on October 9, 1776, by Frs Francisco Pal\u00f3u and Pedro Benito Camb\u00f3n. The Franciscan Order sent the two priests to the then Spanish Province of Alta California to bring in Spanish settlers and evangelize the indigenous Ohlone people. The Ohlone provided most of the labor which built the adobe chapel. The early 20th-century Mission Dolores Basilica replaced a brick parish church built in 1876 that was destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906.\nHistory.\n1700 to 1800.\nThe site of the future Mission San Francisco was scouted by the Spanish missionary Pedro Font in March 1776 during a visit to the Bay Area by the Spanish explorer Juan Bautista de Anza. The Spanish missionaries named the new mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, in honor of Francis of Assisi, founder of the Franciscan Order. It became commonly known as Mission Dolores, after the nearby creek and water source, \"Arroyo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de los Dolores (Our Lady of Sorrows Creek)\"\nOn October 9, 1776, the missionaries dedicated a small chapel in present-day San Francisco as the Mission San Francisco. According to some sources, the chapel stood near the present intersection of Camp and Albion Streets\".\" Members of the local Ramaytush Ohlone tribe are recorded as entering the mission in 1785. They would later provide the labor to build the new mission church.\nThe construction of adobe walls for the Mission Dolores church began in 1788, with the Ohlone laborers manufacturing 36,000 bricks. By 1790, the walls were completed, plastered, and whitewashed.The missionary Jun\u00edpero Serra is recorded as having celebrated a mass at the chapel while it was still under construction.\nThe Mission Dolores adobe church was finished in 1791. The new church had adobe walls that were four feet thick. The roof beams were redwood and the ceiling displayed traditional Ohlone designs, painted in vegetable dyes. The mission complex at this time included a convent and facilities for agriculture and manufacturing.\n1800 to 1848.\nThe early 19th century saw the greatest period of activity at Mission San Francisco:\nAt its peak in 1810\u20131820, the average Indian population at Pueblo Dolores was about 1,100 people. In 1810 the Mission owned 11,000 sheep, 11,000 cows, and thousands of horses, goats, pigs, and mules. Its ranching and farming operations extended as far south as San Mateo and east to Alameda. Horses were corralled on Potrero Hill, and the milking sheds for the cows were located along Dolores Creek at what is today Mission High School. Twenty looms were kept in operation to process wool into cloth. The circumference of the Mission's holdings was said to have been about 125 miles.\nRecords in the early 19th century record some indigenous peoples being baptized or living at the mission. On March 2, 1811, seventeen Miwok-speaking people from the Omiomi tribelet were baptized at the mission. Between 1806 and 1816, 30 indigenous girls, between the ages of nine and nineteen years old, who were known as \"monjas\" (nuns) were recorded as dying at the mission. However, they were more likely to be living in the monjer\u00edo, the dormitory for single women, rather than being nuns who had taken vows.\nIn 1817, the Franciscans established the Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel in San Rafael, California as an a\"sistencia\" to act as a hospital for the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds. San Rafael became an independent mission in 1822.\nWith the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the newly independent Mexico took control of Alta California. Relations were strained between the new Mexican Government and the Franciscan overseers of the California missions. Supplies were scarce and over 5,000 Native Americans had died from disease and other causes at the Mission San Francisco. The Mexican Government decided to free the Native Americans who were under mission guardianship and give them mission lands.\nNew regulations under the Mexican Secularization Act of 1833 forced the missions in 1834 to start selling their vast commercial properties. In practical terms, this meant that each mission could only own its church, its priests residence and small plots of land surrounding the church for gardens. The Mission San Francisco sold most of its property in 1836. By 1842, only eight Native Americans were still residing there.\n1848 to 1900.\nAfter the Mexican-American War ended in 1848, the Mission San Francisco and the rest of Alta California became part of the United States. With the end of Mexican authority, the rules governing the California missions became defunct.\nIn 1848, the California Gold Rush brought a surge of American immigrants and commercial activity to the San Francisco area. In the 1850s, the city constructed two plank roads from the downtown area to the Mission District. The area soon became a popular resort and entertainment center. The Franciscans sold or leased some of the remaining mission land to developers who built saloons and gambling halls. By 1857, the Franciscans had turned control of the Mission San Francisco to the Archdiocese of San Francisco.\nDuring the late 19th century, the archdiocese converted part of the old convent into a two-story wooden wing for use as a seminary and priests' residence. The rest of the convent building became the Mansion House, a tavern. By 1876, the archdiocese had razed the Mansion House, replacing it with a large Gothic Revival brick church to accommodate more congregants than the adobe church\nThe archdiocese also covered the adobe church with clapboard siding for both cosmetic and protective reasons. The siding was removed in a later renovation.\n1900 to the present.\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed the brick church and damaged the adobe building. To prevent the huge fire sparked by the earthquake from engulfing the two buildings, firefighters blew up the convent and School of Notre Dame building across the street. In 1913, the archdiocese began constructing the Mission Dolores Church to replace the destroyed brick church. The architect Willis Polk restored the adobe building in 1917.\nThe construction of the new Mission Dolores Church experienced delays due to the American entry into World War I in 1917. It was finally completed in 1918. The church was remodeled in 1926, with the archdiocese adding churrigueresque ornamentation. These were inspired by exhibits at the 1915 Panama\u2013California Exposition in San Diego, California.\nIn 1952, Archbishop John J. Mitty announced that Pope Pius XII had elevated Mission Dolores to the status of a minor basilica. It became the first minor basilica west of the Mississippi River and the fifth one in the United States.\nToday, the church constructed in 1918 is referred to as the Mission Dolores Basilica while the 1791 adobe chapel is called the Mission Dolores. The mission complex also includes the historic Cemetery and Gardens of Mission Dolores. The gardens includes native plants, which would have been found in the 1791 period, as well as a rose garden that was gifted and is maintained by the Golden Gate Rose Society. There is also an Ohlone Indian ethno-botanic garden. \nCemetery.\nThe mission holds the San Francisco de As\u00eds cemetery, which is the oldest cemetery in San Francisco. Grave markers date between 1830 and 1898. The cemetery has the unmarked graves of about 5,000 indigenous peoples of California, including Ohlone and Miwok people. Other people buried thee include Luis Antonio Arguello, Lieutenant Moraga (the first commandment of the Presidio), Don Francisco De Haro, William Leidesdorf, and victims of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance.\nArt.\nMission Dolores Mural.\nThe Mission Dolores adobe chapel contains the Mission Dolores mural, painted in 1791 by Ohlone artists. The mural covers the entire rear wall of the building, behind the historic wooden altar. It measures 22 by 20 feet and includes two statuary niches. In 1796, the Franciscans installed a baroque-style relief sculpture called a \"reredos\" in front of the mural. In later years, the mural was covered up with wooden boarding. The mural was rediscovered during a renovation in 1910.\nPart of the mural depicts the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary. The mural also contains the image of a rooster, a Christian symbol of the resurrection of Jesus.\nJun\u00edpero Serra statue.\nThe Jun\u00edpero Serra statue is located on the grounds of the Mission San Francisco complex. The cast stone sculpture was designed by the American artist Arthur Putnam and completed in 1909. It was cast between 1916 and 1917, and installed in 1918 when the mission was remodeled.\nFunding for the sculpture came from D.J. McQuarry and it cost $500 to cast. It is approximately 6\u00a0ft 6\u00a0in tall. The sculpture depicts Serra wearing a Franciscan friar's robe belted at the waist with a knotted rope and a rosary around his neck. The sculpture is on a concrete base. It is one of a series of allegorical figures commissioned by the estate of E. W. Scripps to depict California history. In 1993 it was examined by the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! program. The program determined that the sculpture was well-maintained.\nFrancis of Assisi stained glass window.\nThe Mission Dolores Basilica contains a stained glass window of Francis of Assisi, created by the German artist Franz Xaver Zettler at the time of the church's construction.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded November 1, 1776 in colonial \"Las Californias\" by Spanish Catholic missionaries of the Franciscan Order, it was named for Saint John of Capistrano. The Spanish Colonial Baroque style church was located in the Alta California province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The Mission was founded less than 60 yards from the village of Acjacheme. The Mission was secularized by the Mexican government in 1833, and returned to the Roman Catholic Church by the United States government in 1865. The Mission was damaged over the years by a number of natural disasters, but restoration and renovation efforts date from around 1910. It functions today as a museum.\nIntroduction.\nThe mission was founded in 1776, by the Spanish Catholics of the Franciscan Order. Named for Saint John of Capistrano, a 14th-century theologian and \"warrior priest\" who resided in the Abruzzo region of Italy, San Juan Capistrano has the distinction of being home to the oldest building in California still in use, a chapel built in 1782. \"Father Serra's Church\", also known as \"Serra's Chapel\", is the only extant structure where it has been documented that Junipero Serra celebrated Mass. The mission is one of the best known in Alta California, and one of the few to have actually been founded twice \u2013 the others being Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel and Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n. The site was originally consecrated on October 30, 1775, by Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n, but was quickly abandoned due to unrest among the indigenous population in San Diego.\nThe success of the settlement's population is evident in its historical records. Prior to the arrival of the missionaries, some 550 indigenous Acjachemen people lived in this area of their homeland. By 1790, the number of Indian reductions had grown to 700 Mission Indians, and just six years later nearly 1,000 \"neophytes\" (recent converts) lived in or around the Mission compound. Baptisms in that year alone numbered 1,649 out of the none total 4,639 people converted between 1776 and 1847.\nMore than 69 former inhabitants, mostly \"Juane\u00f1o\" Indians, have marked graves in the Mission's cemetery (\"campo santo\"). The remains of (later Monsignor) St. John O'Sullivan, who recognized the property's historic value and working tirelessly to conserve and rebuild its structures, are buried at the entrance to the cemetery on west side of the property, and a statue raised in his honor stands at the head of the crypt. The surviving chapel also serves as the final resting place of three priests who passed on while serving at the Mission: Jos\u00e9 Barona, Vicente Fust\u00e9r, and Vicente Pascual Oliva are all entombed beneath the sanctuary floor.\nThe \"Criolla\" or \"Mission grape,\" was first planted at San Juan Capistrano in 1779, and in 1783 the first wine produced in Alta California was from the Mission's winery.\nThe Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after Mexican government secularization in 1833. After 1850 U.S. statehood, numerous efforts were made over the latter 19th century to restore the Mission to its former state, but none achieved much success until the arrival of O'Sullivan in 1910. Restoration efforts continue, and the chapel called \"Father Serra Church\" is still used for religious services.\nOver 500,000 visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission each year. And while the ruins of \"The Great Stone Church\" (which was all but leveled by an 1812 earthquake) are a renowned architectural wonder, the Mission is perhaps best known for the annual \"Return of the Swallows\" which is traditionally observed every March 19 (\"Saint Joseph's Day\"). Mission San Juan Capistrano has served as a favorite subject for many notable artists, and has been immortalized in literature and on film numerous times.\nIn 1984, a modern church complex was constructed just north and west of the Mission compound and is now known as Mission Basilica San Juan Capistrano. Today, the mission compound serves as a museum, with the Serra Chapel within the compound serving as a chapel for the mission parish.\nHistory.\nIndigenous peoples.\n The former Spanish settlement at Sajavit lies within that area occupied during the late Paleoindian period and continuing on into the present day by the Native American society commonly known as the \"Juane\u00f1o\"; the name denotes those people who were ministered by the priests at Mission San Juan Capistrano. Many contemporary \"Juane\u00f1o\", who identify themselves as descendants of the indigenous society living in the local San Juan and San Mateo Creek drainage areas, have adopted the indigenous term \"Acjachemen\". Their language was related to the \"Luise\u00f1o\" language spoken by the nearby \"Luise\u00f1o\" tribe.\nThe \"Acjachemen\" territory extended from Las Pulgas Creek in northern San Diego County up into the San Joaquin Hills along Orange County's central coast, and inland from the Pacific Ocean up into the Santa Ana Mountains. The bulk of the population occupied the outlets of two large creeks, San Juan Creek (and its major tributary, Trabuco Creek) and San Mateo Creek (combined with Arroyo San Onofre, which drained into the ocean at the same point). The highest concentration of villages was along the lower San Juan, where Mission San Juan Capistrano was ultimately situated and is preserved today. The \"Acjachemen\" resided in permanent, well-defined villages and seasonal camps. Village populations ranged from between 35 and 300 inhabitants, consisting of a single lineage in the smaller villages, and of a dominant clan joined with other families in the larger settlements.\nEach clan had its own resource territory and was \"politically\" independent; ties to other villages were maintained through economic, religious, and social networks in the immediate region. The elite class (composed chiefly families, lineage heads, and other ceremonial specialists), a middle class (established and successful families), and people of disconnected or wandering families and captives of war comprised the three hierarchical social classes. Native leadership consisted of the \"Nota\", or clan chief, who conducted community rites and regulated ceremonial life in conjunction with the council of elders (\"Puuplem\"), which was made up of lineage heads and ceremonial specialists in their own right. This body decided upon matters of the community, which were then carried out by the \"Nota\" and his underlings. While the placement of residential huts in a village was not regulated, the ceremonial enclosure (\"Vanquech\") and the chief's home were most often centrally located.\nMuch has been discovered about the native inhabitants in recent centuries, thanks in part to the efforts of the Spanish explorer Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo, who documented his observations of life in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542. Fray Ger\u00f3nimo Boscana, a Franciscan scholar who was stationed at San Juan Capistrano for more than a decade beginning in 1812, compiled what is widely considered to be the most comprehensive study of prehistoric religious practices in the San Juan Capistrano valley. Religious knowledge was secret, and the prevalent religion, called \"Chinigchinich\", placed village chiefs in the position of religious leaders, an arrangement that gave the chiefs broad power over their people. Boscana divided the \"Acjachemen\" into two classes: the \"\"Playanos\" (who lived along the coast) and the \"Serranos\" (who inhabited the mountains, some three to four leagues from the Mission). The religious beliefs of the two groups as related to creation differed quite profoundly. The \"Playanos\" held that an all-powerful and unseen being called \"Nocuma\"\" brought about the earth and the sea, together with all of the trees, plants, and animals of sky, land, and water contained therein. The \"Serranos\", on the other hand, believed in two separate but related existences: the \"existence above\" and the \"existence below.\" These states of being were \"altogether explicable and indefinite\" (like brother and sister), and it was the fruits of the union of these two entities that created \"...the rocks and sands of the earth; then trees, shrubbery, herbs and grass; then animals\". In 1908, noted cultural anthropologist Alfred L. Kroeber published the following observations with regard to the Juane\u00f1o religious observances:\nWe know that they adore a large bird similar to a kite, which they raise with the greatest of care from the time it is young, and they hold to many errors regarding it.\nWhen a new moon shows itself they make a great outcry, which manifests their interest (\"negosijo\"). If there is an eclipse of the sun or of the moon, they shout with still louder outcries, beating the ground, skins, or mats with sticks, which shows their concerns and uneasiness.\nMission Period (1776\u20131833).\nJuan Cresp\u00ed, as a member of the 1769 Spanish Portol\u00e0 expedition, authored the first written account of interaction between Europeans and the indigenous population in the region that today makes up Orange County. The expedition arrived at the site from the northeast, traveling down San Juan Creek, and camped near the future mission site on July 23. At the time, Crespi named the campsite after Santa Maria Magdalena (though it would also come to be called the \"Arroyo de la Quema\" and \"Ca\u00f1ada del Incendio\", \"Wildfire Hollow\").\nIn early 1775, Don Antonio Mar\u00eda de Bucareli y Urs\u00faa, Viceroy of New Spain, authorized the establishment of a mission at a logical halfway point between Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 and Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel. By that time, the site was already known by the name of its patron saint, \"San Juan Capistrano\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUp from the south slow filed a train,\nPriests and Soldiers of Old Spain,\nWho, through sunlit lomas wound\nWith cross and lance, intent to found\nA mission in the wild to John\nSoldier-Saint of Capistrano.\nAt the proposed site, located approximately 26 \"leguas\" (Spanish Leagues) north of San Diego, 18 leagues south of San Gabriel, and half a league from the Pacific Ocean, an \"enramada\" (arbor) was constructed, two bronze bells were hung from the branch of a nearby tree, and a wooden cross was erected. The grounds were consecrated by Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n of Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on October 30, 1775 (the last day of the octave after the feast of San Juan Capistrano), near an Indian settlement named \"Sajavit\"; thus, La Misi\u00f3n de San Juan Capistrano de Sajavit was founded.\nAssisting clergy Greg\u00f3rio Am\u00farrio of Mission San Luis Obispo arrived from San Gabriel eight days later with a supply of goods and cattle. Unfortunately, word arrived from San Diego at the same time that a group of natives attacked the mission and brutally murdered one of the missionaries (Lu\u00eds Jayme). Since it was feared at the time that any hostile action by the natives against the few burgeoning outposts might break Spain's tenuous hold on Alta California, the priests quickly buried the San Juan Capistrano Mission bells. Lieutenant Jos\u00e9 Francisco Ortega, military leader of the expedition, led all but a small contingent of Spanish soldiers back to El Presidio de San Diego to help quell the uprising; the priests, along with the few remaining soldiers as an escort, gathered up their belongings and fled to the safety of the Presido, where they were given further details of the disaster.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOne year later Serra himself, along with Am\u00farrio and Pablo de Mug\u00e1rtegui, took up work on the Mission at San Juan Capistrano; the contingent, accompanied by eleven soldiers, arrived on October 30 or 31, 1776. Upon their return to the site today known as \"\"Mission Vieja\",\" the party excavated the bells and constructed a new arbor; the original wooden cross was, to their surprise, still standing. Serra celebrated High Mass in thanksgiving on November 1, 1776\u2014celebrated ever since as the official founding date. Due to an inadequate water supply the Mission site was subsequently relocated approximately three miles to the west less than 60 yards from the village of \"Ac\u00e1gcheme\". The new venue was strategically placed above two nearby streams, the Trabuco and the San Juan. Mission San Gabriel provided cattle and neophyte labor to assist in the development of the new Mission. Am\u00farrio performed the Mission's first baptism on December 19 of that year (a total of 4,639 souls were converted at the Mission between 1776 and 1847.) The first Indian marriage was blessed by Mug\u00e1rtegui on the feast of the \"Espousals of the Blessed Virgin Mary,\" January 23, 1777. Mug\u00e1rtegui also presided over the first burial ceremony on July 13 (the first burial on Mission grounds would not take place until March 9, 1781). The Registers of Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials are all intact and preserved at the Mission, as is the Confirmation Register (San Juan Capistrano is one of the few Missions to have retained this document). Serra visited the Mission for the first time since its founding and administered the Sacrament of Confirmation on October 22. In 1778, the first adobe \"capilla\" (chapel) was blessed. It was replaced by a larger, long house of worship in 1782, which is regarded as the oldest standing building in California. Known proudly as the \"Serra Chapel,\" it also has the distinction of being the only remaining church in which Serra is known to have officiated (\"Mission Dolores\" was still under construction at the time of Serra's visit there). Serra presided over the confirmations of 213 people on October 12 and 13, 1783. By the time of the chapel's completion, living quarters, kitchens (\"pozolera\"), workshops, storerooms, soldiers' barracks (\"cuartels\"), and a number of other ancillary buildings had also been erected, effectively forming the main \"cuadr\u00e1ngulo\" (quadrangle).\nCalifornia's first vineyard was located on the Mission grounds, with the planting of the \"Mission\" or \"Criollo\" grape in 1779, one grown extensively throughout Spanish America at the time but with \"an uncertain European origin.\" It was the only grape grown in the Mission system throughout the mid-19th century. The first winery in Alta California was built in San Juan Capistrano in 1783; both red and white wines (sweet and dry), brandy, and a port-like fortified wine called Angelica were all produced from the Mission grape. In 1791, the Mission's two original bells were removed from the tree branch on which they had been hanging for the previous fifteen years and placed within a permanent mounting. Over the next two decades the Mission prospered, and in 1794 over seventy adobe structures were built in order to provide permanent housing for the Mission Indians, some of which comprise the oldest residential neighborhood in California. It was decided that a larger, European-style church was required to accommodate the growing population. Hoping to construct an edifice of truly magnificent proportions, the priests retained the services of \"maestro alba\u00f1il\" (master stonemason) Is\u00eddro Aguil\u00e1r of Culiac\u00e1n. Agu\u00edlar took charge of the church's construction and set about incorporating numerous design features not found at any other California Mission, including the use of a domed roof structure made of stone as opposed to the typical flat wood roof. His elegant roof design called for six vaulted domes (\"bovedas\") to be built. \nThe Great Stone Church.\nWork was begun on \"The Great Stone Church\" (the only chapel building in Alta California not constructed out of adobe) on February 2, 1797. It was laid out in the shape of a cross, measuring long by wide with high walls, and included a tall \"campanile\" (bell tower) located adjacent to the main entrance. Local legend has it that the tower could be seen for or more, and that the bells could be heard from even farther away. The sandstone building sat on a foundation seven feet thick. Construction efforts required the participation of the entire neophyte population. Stones were quarried from gullies and creek beds up to away and transported in carts (\"carretas\") drawn by oxen, carried by hand, and even dragged to the building site. Limestone was crushed into a powder on the Mission grounds to create a mortar that was more erosion-resistant than the actual stones.\nOn the afternoon of November 22, 1800, tremors from the 6.5-magnitude San Diego earthquake cracked the walls of the rising edifice, necessitating that repair work be performed. Unfortunately, Se\u00f1or Aguil\u00e1r died six years into the project; his work was carried on by the priests and their charges, who made their best attempts to emulate the existing construction. Lacking the skills of a master mason, however, led to irregular walls and necessitated the addition of a seventh roof dome. The church was finally completed in 1806, and blessed by Fray Est\u00e9van Tap\u00eds on the evening of September 7; a two-day-long \"fiesta\" followed. The sanctuary floors were paved with diamond-shaped tiles, and brick-lined niches displayed the statues of various saints. It was by all accounts the most magnificent in all of California and a three-day feast was held in celebration of this monumental achievement.\nOn the morning of December 8, 1812, the \"Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin\", a series of large earthquakes shook Southern California during the first Sunday service. The 7.5-magnitude San Juan Capistrano earthquake racked the doors to the church, pinning them shut. When the ground finally stopped shaking, the bulk of the nave had come crashing down, and the bell tower was obliterated. Forty native worshipers who were attending Mass and two boys who had been ringing the bells in the tower were buried under the rubble and lost their lives, and were subsequently interred in the Mission cemetery. This was the second major setback the outpost had suffered, and followed severe storms and flooding that had damaged Mission buildings and ruined crops earlier in the year. \nThe priests immediately resumed holding services in Serra's Church. Within a year a brick \"campanario\" (\"bell wall\") had been erected between the ruins of the stone church and the Mission's first chapel to support the four bells salvaged from the rubble of the campanile. As the transept, sanctuary (\"re-do's\"), and \"sacristia\" (sacristy) were all left standing, an attempt was made to rebuild the stone church in 1815 which failed due to a lack of construction expertise (the latter is the only element that is completely intact today). Consequently, all of the construction work undertaken at the Mission grounds thereafter was of a strictly utilitarian nature. Jos\u00e9 Barona and Boscana oversaw the construction of a small infirmary (hospital) building (located just outside the northwestern corner of the quadrangle) in 1814, \"for the convenience of the sick.\" It is here that \"Juane\u00f1o\" medicine men used traditional methods to heal the sick and injured. Archaeological excavations in 1937 and 1979 unearthed what are believed to be the building's foundations.\nThe Day That Pirates Sacked The Mission.\nOn December 14, 1818, the French privateer Hip\u00f3lito Bouchard, sailing under the flag of the \"United Provinces of Rio de la Plata\" (Argentina), brought his ships \"La Argentina\" and \"Santa Rosa\" to within sight of the Mission; aware that Bouchard (today known as \"California's only pirate\") had recently conducted raids on the settlements at Monterey and Santa Barbara, Comandante Ru\u00edz had sent forth a party of thirty men (under the leadership of a young Spanish lieutenant named Santiago Arg\u00fcello) to protect the Mission at first news of the approach on the 13th. Two members of Bouchard's contingent made contact with the garrison soldiers and made their demand for provisions, which was rebuffed with added threats: Lieutenant Arg\u00fcello replied that if the ships did not sail away the garrison would gladly provide \"an immediate supply of shot and shell\". In response, \"Pirata Buchar\" (as he was referred to by the Californios) ordered an assault on the Mission, sending some 140 men and two or three \"violentos\" (light howitzer cannon) to take the needed supplies by force. The Mission guards engaged the attackers but were overwhelmed; the marauders looted the Mission warehouses and left minor damage to several Mission buildings in their wake, and reportedly set fire to a few of the outlying straw houses. Reinforcements from Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, led by Comandante Guerra from El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara, arrived the next day to no avail as the ships had already set sail.\nThough the mission was spared, all ammunition, supplies and valuables in the area were taken. Regarded today as one of the more colorful events in the Mission's history, an annual celebration is held to memorialize \"The Day that Pirates Sacked the Mission.\"\nMexican independence.\nMexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821. The 1820s and 30s saw a gradual decline in the Mission's status. Disease thinned out the once ample cattle herds, and a sudden infestation of mustard weed made it increasingly difficult to cultivate crops. Floods and droughts took their toll as well. But the biggest threat to the Mission's stability came from the presence of Spanish settlers who sought to take over Capistrano's fertile lands. Over time the disillusioned Indian population gradually left the Mission, and without regular maintenance its physical deterioration continued at an accelerated rate. Nevertheless, there was sufficient activity along El Camino Real to justify the construction of the Las Flores Asistencia in 1823. This facility, situated halfway between San Juan Capistrano and the Mission at San Luis Rey, was intended to act primarily as a rest stop for traveling clergy. Around 1820 an \"estancia\" (station) was established a few miles north on the banks of the Santa Ana River to accommodate the Mission's sizeable cattle herd. The adobe structure built to house the mayordomo and \"vaqueros\" (cowboys) who tended the Mission herds is known today as the Diego Sep\u00falveda Adobe. Upon his death in 1825, Don Jos\u00e9 Antonio Yorba I (a prominent Spanish land owner and member of the Portol\u00e0 Expedition), was buried in the Mission's cemetery in an unmarked grave; a cenotaph was later placed in Yorba's honor.\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Echeand\u00eda, the first native Mexican to be elected Governor of Alta California, issued his \"Proclamation of Emancipation\" (or \"Prevenci\u00f3nes de Emancipacion\") on July 25, 1826. All Indians within the military districts of San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Monterey who were found qualified were freed from missionary rule and made eligible to become Mexican citizens; those who wished to remain under mission tutelage were exempted from most forms of corporal punishment. Catholic historian Zephyrin Engelhardt referred to Echeand\u00eda as \"...an avowed enemy of the religious orders.\" Despite the fact that Echeand\u00eda's emancipation plan was met with little encouragement from the neophytes who populated the southern missions, he was nonetheless determined to test the scheme on a large scale at Mission San Juan Capistrano. To that end, he appointed a board of \"comisianados\" (commissioners) to oversee the emancipation of the Indians. In response to the proclamation, Barona refused to take the oath of allegiance to what he saw as the \"bogus republic of Mexico\" despite the fact that he, along with all but two of the other Spanish missionaries, had previously sworn to the Independence of Mexico. The Mexican government passed legislation on December 20, 1827, that mandated the expulsion of all Spaniards younger than sixty years of age from Mexican territories; Governor Echeand\u00eda nevertheless intervened on Barona's behalf in order to prevent his deportation once the law took effect in California.\nEven before Mexico had gained its independence, the Mission had begun its decline. Although Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa (who took office in 1833) initially attempted to keep the mission system intact, the Mexican Congress passed \"An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California\" on August 17, 1833. The Act also provided for the colonization of both Alta and Baja California, the expenses of this latter move to be borne by the proceeds gained from the sale of the mission property to private interests. Mission San Juan Capistrano was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834, Governor Figueroa issued his \"Decree of Confiscation.\"\nRancho Period (1834\u20131849).\nOn November 22, 1834, commissioner Juan Jos\u00e9 Rocha formally acknowledged receipt of the Decree of Confiscation. The final inventory for Mission San Juan Capistrano was compiled by Jos\u00e9 Maria de Zalvidea and four of the commissioners, and included:\nfor a total valuation of $54,456. Mission credits totaled $13,123 while debts equaled a mere $1,410. The Mission library included three volumes of Juan de Torquemada and twelve volumes of the \"A\u00f1o Cristiano\". The names of 2,000 neophytes were carried on the Mission rolls. Mission agricultural holdings for that year consisted of:\nThereafter, the Franciscans all but abandoned the Mission, taking with them most everything of value, after which the locals plundered many of the Mission buildings for construction materials. According to Bancroft, \"The population of San Juan Capistrano in 1834 had decreased to 861 souls, and in 1840 it was probably less than 500 with less than 100 at the pueblo proper; while in its crops San Juan (Capistrano) showed a larger deterioration than any other (missionary) establishment.\" By 1835, little of the Mission's assets remained, though the manufacture of hides and tallow continued in full swing as described in Richard Henry Dana's classic novel \"Two Years Before the Mast\". The Mission was declared to be \"in a ruinous state\" and the Indian \"pueblo\" dissolved in 1841. San Juan Capistrano was officially designated by Governor Juan B. Alvarado as a secular Mexican town on July 29, at which time those few who still resided at the Mission were granted sections of land to use as their own. Following this change in status, the area around the Mission began to decay rapidly; Santiago Arg\u00fcello (then prefect of the southern District of Los Angeles) complained to the Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara, Don Jos\u00e9 de la Guerra y Noriega, that \"...the unfortunate missions of San Gabriel and San Juan Capistrano [have] been converted into brothels of the mayordomos.\nFour years later, the Mission property was auctioned off under questionable circumstances for $710 worth of tallow and hides (equivalent to $15,000 in 2004 dollars) to Englishman John (Don Juan) Forster (Governor P\u00edo Pico's brother-in-law, whose family would take up residence in the friars' quarters for the next twenty years) and his partner James McKinley. More families would subsequently take up residence in other portions of the Mission buildings. Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zalvidea left San Juan Capistrano on or about November 25, 1842, when Mission San Luis Rey de Francia's Ibarra died, leaving the Mission without a resident priest for the first time (Zalvidea had been the Mission's sole priest ever since the death of Josef Barona in 1831.) The first secular priest to take charge of the mission, Reverend Jos\u00e9 Maria Ros\u00e1les, arrived on October 8, 1843; Vicente Pascual Oliva, the last resident missionary, died on January 2, 1848.\nCalifornia statehood (1850\u20131900).\nBecause virtually all of the artwork at the missions served either a devotional or didactic purpose, there was no underlying reason for the mission residents to record their surroundings graphically; visitors, however, found them to be objects of curiosity. During the 1850s a number of artists found gainful employment as draftsmen attached to expeditions sent to map the Pacific coastline and the border between California and Mexico (as well as plot practical railroad routes); many of the drawings were reproduced as lithographs in the expedition reports. The oldest surviving sketch of the Mission, dating back to 1850 and now in the collection of the Bancroft Library, shows that the domes above the stone church's transept, along with the main dome and cupola (lantern house) located above the sanctuary, survived the 1812 earthquake. The earliest known photograph of San Juan Capistrano was taken by German-born artist Edward Vischer in 1860. Even before that time, however, the ruins at San Juan Capistrano and its stone church had been romanticized by landscape painters, writers, and historians. The ruins have been compared to those of Greece and Rome, and have at various times been referred to as the \"Alhambra of America,\" the \"American Acropolis,\" and the \"Melrose Abbey of the West.\" Also in 1860, an abortive attempt at restoring the stone church was the cause of its additional disintegration, forcing the domes over the transept and sanctuary to collapse.\nA smallpox epidemic swept through the area in 1862, nearly wiping out the remaining \"Juane\u00f1o Indians\". President Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation on March 18, 1865, that restored ownership of the Mission proper to the Roman Catholic Church. The document remains on display in the Mission's barracks \"cum\" museum. Ownership of was conveyed to the Church, for all practical intents being the exact area of land occupied by the original Mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens. The Mission's sole resident from April 1866, to April 1886, was its pastor, Jos\u00e9 Mut. Mut made certain changes in order to accommodate his own needs, but little was accomplished to prevent further deterioration of the Mission buildings. Around 1873, some forty \"Juane\u00f1o\" were still associated with the Mission; however, many of those of mixed Spanish/Mexican and \"Juane\u00f1o\" heritage were not taken into consideration, and several native villages still existed in the interior valleys. During this same era, the Mission priests established a circuit-riding ministry to these interior villages to the south, and on the other side of the Palomar Mountain Range. A wave of migration by the \"Juane\u00f1o\" out of San Juan occurred in 1880\u20131900 as towns in northern Orange County started to form and needed laborers.\nThe 1880s also saw the appearance of a number of articles on the missions in national publications and the first books on the subject; as a result, a large number of artists did one or more mission paintings, though few attempted series. By 1891 a roof collapse required that the Serra Chapel be abandoned completely. Modifications were made to the original adobe church (including the addition of a cross-topped \"espada\u00f1a\" at the south end, a feature that has been retained in the present iteration of the Mission compound) in order to render it suitable for use as a parish church. In 1894, the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway constructed a new depot in the emerging \"Mission Revival Style\" mere blocks from the Mission. It is rumored that the stonework, bricks, and roof tiles were salvaged from the decaying buildings. The following year, a group calling itself the \"Landmarks Club of Southern California\" (under the direction of acclaimed American journalist, historian, and photographer Charles Fletcher Lummis) made the first real efforts in over fifty years at preserving the Mission and restoring it to its original state. Over 400 tons of debris was cleared away, holes in the walls were patched, and new shake cedar roofs were placed over a few of the derelict buildings; nearly a mile of walkways were repaved with asphalt and gravel as well.\n20th century and beyond (since 1901).\nAfter Mut's departure in 1886 the parish found itself without a permanent pastor, and the Mission languished during this period. St. John O'Sullivan arrived in San Juan Capistrano in 1910 to recuperate from a recent stroke, and to seek relief from chronic tuberculosis. He became fascinated by the scope of the Mission and soon set to work on rebuilding it a section at a time. O'Sullivan's first task was to repair the roof of the Serra Chapel (which was being employed as a granary and storeroom) using sycamore logs to match those that were used in the original work; in the process, the roof of the apse was raised to allow for the inclusion of a window so that natural light could be brought into the space. Other refurbishments were made as time and funds permitted. Arthur B. Benton, a Los Angeles architect, strengthened the chapel walls through the addition of heavy masonry buttresses. The centerpiece of the chapel is its spectacular \"retablo\" which serves as the backdrop for the altar. A masterpiece of Baroque art, the altarpiece was hand-carved of 396 individual pieces of cherry wood and overlaid in gold leaf in Barcelona and is estimated to be 400 years old. It was originally imported from Barcelona in 1806 for the Los Angeles cathedral but was never used. It was later donated by Archbishop John Joseph Cantwell of Los Angeles and installed sometime between 1922 and 1924 (the north end of the building had to be enlarged to accommodate this piece due to its height). Although the \"retablo\" had been relayered over the centuries, most of the original gilding remains underneath the modern materials (extensive restoration was begun in June 2006).\nThe first of many Hollywood productions to use San Juan Capistrano as a backdrop was D.W. Griffith's 1910 western film \"The Two Brothers\" (the first film ever shot in Orange County). On January 7, 1911, the film's leading lady, silent film star Mary Pickford, secretly wed fellow actor Owen Moore in the Mission chapel. Artist Charles Percy Austin often stayed in San Juan Capistrano and donated several of his works, the most notable being his memorialization of Pickford's wedding ceremony, appropriately entitled \"Mary Pickford's Wedding\", which he painted after O'Sullivan performed the marriage rites. Noted portraitist Joseph Kleitsch also resided at the Mission for a time, and painted a portrait of O'Sullivan in 1924 (among other works). The third and final act of John Steven McGroarty's \"The Mission Play\" (1911) is set \"...amid the broken and deserted walls of Mission San Juan Capistrano (the Mission of the Swallow), in 1847.\"\nSevere flooding destroyed a portion of the Mission's front arcade in 1915, and heavy storms a year later washed away one end of the barracks building (which O'Sullivan rebuilt in 1917), incorporating minor modifications such as an ornamental archway in order to make the edifice more closely resemble a church. The Mission grounds were enclosed with a wood picket fence, and beginning on May 9, 1916, a ten-cent admission fee was charged to help defray preservation costs. In 1918, the Mission was given parochial status, with O'Sullivan serving as its first modern pastor. It was on April 21 of that year that the https:// caused moderate structural damage to some of the buildings. In 1919, author Johnston McCulley created the character \"Zorro\" and chose Mission San Juan Capistrano as the setting for the first novella, \"The Curse of Capistrano\". In 1920, the \"Sacred Garden\" was created in the courtyard adjacent to the stone church, and in 1925 the full restoration of the Serra Chapel was completed. O'Sullivan died in 1933 and was interred in the Mission cemetery (\"campo santo\") amongst more than 2,000 former inhabitants (mostly \"Juane\u00f1o\" Indians), who are buried in unmarked graves. O'Sullivan's tomb lies at the foot of a Celtic cross that O'Sullivan himself erected as a memorial to the Mission's builders.\nAfter O'Sullivan's death, Arthur J. Hutchinson (another pastor with a love of California history) assumed leadership of the Mission, and played a central role in raising needed funds to continue the Mission's preservation work. Pastor Hutchinson made key archeological discoveries on the Mission grounds during his tenure (he died on July 27, 1951), after which time his work was continued by the next two pastors, Monsignors Vincent Lloyd-Russell and Paul M. Martin. In 1937, representatives of the U.S. National Park Service's Historic American Buildings Survey, as a part of the Historic Sites Act of 1935, surveyed and photographed the grounds and structures extensively. Their efforts laid the groundwork for future excavation and reconstruction of the west wing industrial complex. Monsignor Martin began a comprehensive preservation effort following the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake.\nThe prestigious World Monuments Fund placed \"The Great Stone Church\" on its \"List of 100 Most Endangered Sites\" in 2002. The most recent series of seismic retrofits at the Mission were completed at a cost of $7.5 million in 2004. About half a million visitors, including 80,000 school children, come to the Mission each year.\nA number of events are held at the mission today. The main fundraising event, Battle of the Mariachis, has been held since 2004 and started as a way to honor its heritage.\nMission industries.\nThe goal of the missions was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, was the most important industry of any mission. Barley, maize, and wheat were the principal crops grown at San Juan Capistrano; cattle, horses, mules, sheep, and goats were all raised by the hundreds as well. In 1790, the Mission's herd included 7,000 sheep and goats, 2,500 cattle, and 200 mules and horses. Olives were grown, cured, and pressed under large stone wheels to extract their oil, both for use at the Mission and to trade for other goods. Grapes were also grown and fermented into wine for sacramental use and again, for trading. The specific variety, called the \"Criolla\" or \"Mission grape\", was first planted at the Mission in 1779; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from San Juan Capistrano's winery. Until about 1850, Mission grapes represented the entirety of viticulture in the state. Cereal grains were dried and ground by stone into flour. The Mission's kitchens and bakeries prepared and served thousands of meals each day. Candles, soap, grease, and ointments were all made from tallow (rendered animal fat) in large vats located just outside the west wing. Also situated in this general area were vats for dyeing wool and tanning leather, and primitive looms for weavings. Large \"bodegas\" (warehouses) provided long-term storage for preserved foodstuffs and other treated materials.\nThree long \"zanjas\" (aqueducts) ran through the central courtyard and deposited the water they collected into large cisterns in the industrial area, where it was filtered for drinking and cooking, or dispensed for use in cleaning. The Mission had to fabricate all of its construction materials as well. Workers in the \"carpinter\u00eda\" (carpentry shop) used crude methods to shape beams, lintels, and other structural elements; more skilled artisans carved doors, furniture, and wooden implements. For certain applications bricks (\"ladrillos\") were fired in ovens (kilns) to strengthen them and make them more resistant to the elements; when \"tejas\" (roof tiles) eventually replaced the conventional \"jacal\" roofing (densely packed reeds) they were placed in the kilns to harden them as well. Glazed ceramic pots, dishes, and canisters were also made in the Mission's kilns.\nPrior to the establishment of the missions, the native peoples' way of life involved the use of bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and so forth. The missionaries decided that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to the masculine sex, had to be taught industry in order to learn how to support their social and economic goals. The result was the establishment of a great manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise used by the natives was produced at the missions under the supervision of the priests; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. The foundry at Mission San Juan Capistrano was the first to introduce the Indians to the Iron Age. The blacksmith used the Mission's Catalan furnaces (California's first) to smelt and fashion iron into everything from basic tools and hardware (such as nails) to crosses, gates, hinges, even cannon for Mission defense. Iron was one commodity in particular that the Mission relied solely on trade to acquire, as the missionaries had neither the know-how nor the technology to mine and process metal ores.\nMission bells.\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The original bells were hung from a large nearby tree for some fifteen years, until the chapel bell tower was completed in 1791. What ultimately became of the original bells is not known. New bells were cast in Chile for inclusion in the belfry of \"The Great Stone Church.\" All four of Mission San Juan Capistrano's bells are named and all bear inscriptions as follows (from the largest to the smallest; inscriptions are translated from Latin):\nIn the aftermath of the 1812 earthquake, the two largest bells cracked and split open. Due to this damage neither produced clear tones. Regardless, they were hung in the campanario that went up the following year. During the Mission's heyday, a lone bell also hung at the west end of the front corridor, next to an entrance gate which has long since eroded away. One of O' Sullivan's companions during his tenure at San Juan Capistrano was Jos\u00e9 de Gracia Cruz, better known as Ac\u00fa, who related many stories and legends of the Mission. A descendant of the \"Juane\u00f1o\" Indians, he served as the Mission's bell ringer until his death in 1924.\nOn March 22, 1969, President Richard M. Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon visited the Mission and rang the Bell of San Rafael. A bronze plaque commemorating the event is set in the bell wall. In celebration of the new Mission church being elevated to minor basilica status in 2000, exact duplicates of the damaged bells were cast by Royal Bellfoundry Petit &amp; Fritsen b.v. of Aarle-Rixtel, the Netherlands using molds made from the originals. The replacement bells were placed in the bell wall and the old ones put on display within the footprint of the destroyed Mission \"campanile\" (\"bell tower\").\nFolklore.\nLegends.\nThe tragedy of \"The Great Stone Church\" gave rise to its well loved legend, that of a young native girl named Magdalena who was killed in the collapse. Magdalena lived on the Mission grounds and had fallen in love with an artist named Te\u00f3filo. However, the pair was deemed too young to marry by their elders and were forced to carry on their relationship in secret. On that terrible December morning, the repentant Magdalena walked ahead of the procession of worshipers carrying a penitent's candle just as the earthquake struck. Te\u00f3filo rushed into the church as the walls and roof tumbled to the ground in a vain attempt to save his lover. When the rubble was cleared the pair was found among the dead, locked in a final embrace. It is said that on moonlit nights one can sometimes make out the face of a young girl, seemingly illuminated by candlelight, high up in the ruins. Other, less-pervasive legends include that of a faceless monk who haunted the corridors of the original quadrangle, and of a headless soldier who was often seen standing guard near the front entrance.\nReturn of the swallows.\nThe American cliff swallow (\"Petrochelidon pyrrhonota\") is a migratory bird that spends its winters in Goya, Argentina, but makes the trek north to the warmer climes of the American Southwest in springtime. According to legend, the birds, who have visited the San Juan Capistrano area every summer for centuries, first took refuge at the Mission when an irate innkeeper began destroying their mud nests (the birds also frequent the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo). The Mission's location near two rivers made it an ideal location for the swallows to nest, as there was a constant supply of the insects on which they feed, and the young birds are well-protected inside the ruins of the old stone church.\nA 1915 article in \"Overland Monthly\" magazine made note of the birds' annual habit of nesting beneath the Mission's eaves and archways from spring through fall, and made the swallows the \"signature icon\" of the Mission; O'Sullivan used interest in the phenomenon to generate public interest in restoration efforts during his two decades in residence. One of bell ringer Ac\u00fa's most colorful tales was that the swallows (or \"las golondrinas\", as he called them) flew over the Atlantic Ocean to Jerusalem each winter, carrying small twigs on which they could rest atop the water along the way. On March 13, 1939, a popular radio program was broadcast live from the Mission grounds, announcing the swallows' arrival. Composer Leon Ren\u00e9 was so inspired by the event that he penned the song \"When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano\" in tribute. During its initial release the song spent several weeks atop the \"Your Hit Parade\" charts. The song has been recorded by such musicians as The Ink Spots, Fred Waring, Guy Lombardo, Glenn Miller, The Five Satins and Pat Boone. A glassed-off room in the Mission has been designated in Ren\u00e9's honor and displays the upright piano on which he composed the tune, the reception desk from his office and several copies of the song's sheet music and other pieces of furniture, all donated by Ren\u00e9's family.\nEach year the \"Fiesta de las Golondrinas\" is held in the City of San Juan Capistrano. Presented by the San Juan Capistrano Fiesta Association, the \"Fiesta de las Golondrinas\" is a week-long celebration of this auspicious event culminated by the Swallows Day Parade and Mercado, street fair. Tradition has it that the main flock arrives on March 19 (Saint Joseph's Day), and flies south on Saint John's Day, October 23.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When the swallows come back to Capistrano\nThat's the day you promised to come back to me\nWhen you whispered, \"Farewell,\" in Capistrano\n'twas the day the swallows flew out to sea\u2014\u200a\nIn recent years, the swallows have failed to return in large flocks to the Mission. Few birds were counted in the 1990s and 2000s. The reduction has been connected to increased development of the area, including many more choices of nesting place and fewer insects to eat.\nCalifornia pepper tree.\nThe largest California pepper tree (\"Schinus molle\") in the United States resided at Mission San Juan Capistrano until 2005, when it was felled due to disease. The tall specimen, planted in the 1870s, was typical of the early California landscape; it was also listed in the National Register of Big Trees. The oldest pepper tree in California resides in the courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The mission, which was the eighth in California, was founded on January 12, 1777, by the Franciscans. Named for Saint Clare of Assisi, who founded the order of the Poor Clares and was an early companion of St. Francis of Assisi, this was the first California mission to be named in honor of a woman.\nIt is the namesake of both the city and county of Santa Clara, as well as of Santa Clara University, which was built around the mission. This is the only mission located on the grounds of a university campus. Although ruined and rebuilt six times, the settlement was never abandoned, and today it functions as the university chapel for Santa Clara University.\nHistory.\nThe outpost was originally established as \"La Misi\u00f3n Santa Clara de Thamien\" (or \"Mission Santa Clara de Thamien\", a reference to the Tamien people) at the Native American village of \"So-co-is-u-ka\" (meaning \"Laurelwood\", located on the Guadalupe River) on January 12, 1777. There the Franciscan brothers erected a cross and shelter for worship to bring Christianity to the Ohlone people. Floods, fires, and earthquakes damaged many of the early structures and forced relocation to higher ground. The second site is known as Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds. A subsequent site of the mission dating from 1784 to 1819 is located several hundred yards west of the De La Cruz overpass of the Caltrain track; moreover, several Native American burial sites have been discovered near this subsequent site. The current site, home to the first college in Alta California, dates back to 1825.\nInitially, there was tension between the people of the mission and those in the nearby Pueblo de San Jos\u00e8 over disputed ownership rights of land and water. The tension was relieved when a road, the Alameda, was built by two hundred Native Americans to link the communities together. On Sundays, people from San Jose would come to the mission for services, until the building of St. Joseph's Church in 1803. In that year, the mission of Santa Clara reported a Native American population of 1,271. In the same tabular report, its resident priest estimated that 10,000 cattle, 9,500 sheep, 730 horses, 35 mules, and 55 swine were on mission lands, while about 3,000 fanegas of grain (some each of wheat, barley or corn) had been harvested.\nAfter the Mexican secularization act of 1833 most of the mission's land and livestock was sold off by Mexico. The mission land was subdivided, and the land sold to whoever could afford it which often meant it was sold to government officials and with half of the mission land going to Native Americans. Most of the buildings continued to be used as a parish church, unlike the other missions in California. By 1836, the mission Native Americans were \"freed\" by the Mexican government. The local land near the mission had drastically changed in the 60 years of mission operation under the Spanish and many of the native plants needed for Native American survival were gone, requiring a change from the former lifestyle for many Native Americans. Many Native Americans fled to the Central Valley of California, others stayed locally and worked for the new ranchos. There were a few small and short-lived Native American villages established around the Bay Area by 1839; many of these villages could not support themselves, so they began raiding the nearby ranchos.\nIn 1850, California became a state. With that change, priests of the Jesuit order took over the Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds in 1851 from the Franciscans. Father John Nobili, S.J., was put in charge of the mission. He began a college on the mission site in 1851, which grew into Santa Clara University; it is the only mission to become part of a university, and it is also the oldest university in California. Throughout the history of the mission, the bells have rung faithfully every evening, a promise made to King Charles III of Spain when he sent the original bells to the mission in 1777. He asked that the bells be rung each evening at 8:30 in memory of those who had died, although the actual bells have since been replaced by a recording. The bell tower has three bells; one was donated by King Carlos IV but subsequently destroyed in a fire. King Alphonso XIII donated a replacement bell, which is on display in the de Saisset Museum (in the mission).\nIn 1861, a new wooden fa\u00e7ade with two bell towers was attached over the old adobe front of the building. The interior was widened in 1885 to increase the seating capacity by removing the original adobe nave walls. A fire in 1925 destroyed the structure, including the surrounding wall. The church's parochial functions were transferred to the Saint Clare Parish west of the campus. A rebuilt and restored Mission Santa Clara was consecrated in 1929, when it assumed its primary modern function as chapel and centerpiece of the university campus. It is open to visitors daily; the mission museum is located in the university's De Saisset Museum.\nThe original mission cemetery, still in use, is located on nearby Lincoln Street.\nSanta Clara Mission Cemetery.\nSanta Clara Mission Cemetery, also known as Santa Clara Catholic Cemetery, was founded in 1777, alongside the mission by the same Franciscans. In 1851, when Santa Clara College was founded, the cemetery near the mission was running out of space, so they moved the location a few minutes walk from the mission near the adobe home of Fernando Berryessa, son of Maria Zacharias Bernal y Berryessa.\nIn the 1930s, this cemetery completed its first indoor mausoleum. In part due to the popularity of mausoleum burial, in 2015, they began building the St. Ignatius Outdoor Mausoleum Complex.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The parish church in the city of Ventura, California, United States, is a Spanish mission founded by the Order of Friars Minor. Founded on March 31, 1782, it was the ninth Spanish mission established in Alta California (or Nueva California) and the last to be established by the head of the Franciscan missions in California, Jun\u00edpero Serra. Designated a California Historical Landmark, the mission is one of many locally designated landmarks in downtown Ventura.\nThe mission was named after St. Bonaventure, a 13th-century Franciscan saint, one of the early leaders of the Order to which the friars belonged, and a Doctor of the Church. On June 9, 2020, Pope Francis elevated the church to a minor basilica, and on July 15, 2020, the feast day of its patron saint, the announcement of the Pope's action was made and the elevation of the mission's status was officially proclaimed by Archbishop Jos\u00e9 G\u00f3mez of Los Angeles. The name of the mission was changed to reflect this new status in the Catholic Church.\nMission San Buenaventura was planned to be founded in 1770 and become 3rd mission, but the founding was delayed because of the low availability of the military escorts needed to establish the mission. In 1793, the first church burned down. When the mission was completed, it included an adjacent quadrangle with living and work space. All that remains of the original mission is the church and its garden.\nHistory.\nSpanish Empire.\nThe founding of the San Buenaventura Mission traces to the decision on Palm Sunday, March 30, 1749, by the Franciscan friar Junipero Serra to journey to the New World as a missionary to the native peoples.\nThirty-three years and one day later he raised the Cross at \"la playa de la canal de Santa Barbara\" (the beach of the Santa Barbara Channel) on Easter morning, March 31, 1782. Assisted by Pedro Benito Cambon, he celebrated a High Mass, preached on the Resurrection, and dedicated a mission to San Buenaventura (St. Bonaventure). It had been planned as the third in the chain of twenty-one missions founded by Serra but was destined to be the ninth and last founded during his lifetime, and one of six he personally dedicated.\nUnder the direction of Friar Cambon, whom Serra left in charge of the new mission, a system of aqueducts were built by the Chumash people between 1805 and 1815 to meet the needs of the Mission population and consisted of both ditches and elevated stone masonry. The watercourse ran from a point on the Ventura River about \u00bd mile north of the remaining ruins and carried the water to holding tanks behind the mission, a total of about . With plentiful water, the mission was able to maintain flourishing orchards and gardens, which were described by |English navigator George Vancouver as the finest he had seen. The water distribution system was damaged by floods and abandoned in 1862.\nThe mission's first church was destroyed by fire in 1793. The construction of a second church was abandoned because \"the door gave way.\" A permanent replacement was not able to be rebuilt until 1812. About the same time, the San Miguel Chapel and the Santa Gertrudis Chapel were completed.\nA series of earthquakes and an accompanying seismic sea wave in 1812 forced the friars and Indian neophytes to seek temporary shelter a few miles inland. Six years later the friars had to remove sacred objects from the church and the whole mission flee into the hills to elude an attack led by Argentine pirate Hippolyte de Bouchard, who was pillaging the missions and had just conducted a successful attack against Mission San Juan Capistrano.\nMexico.\nAfter its independence from Spain, in 1834 the Mexican government issued a secularization decree, divesting the friars of administrative control over the missions. In 1845 Mission San Buenaventura was rented to Jose Arnaz and Narciso Botello and was later sold illegally to Arnaz.\nThe mission did not fully escape the impact that the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846\u20131847 had on California. On January 5, 1847, while on its way from Santa Barbara to Los Angeles, the 428 men-strong California Battalion, under the command of U.S. Army Major John C. Fremont, managed to disperse an armed force of up to 70 enemy Californios near the mission.\nUnited States.\nAs California had become a state of the Union, when Joseph Sadoc Alemany, O.P., was named the first Bishop of Monterey in 1850, he petitioned the United States Government to return that part of the mission holdings comprising the church, clergy residence, cemetery, orchard, and vineyard to the Catholic Church. The request was granted in the form of a proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln on May 23, 1862.\nBecause of severe damage in the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake, the Mission's tile roof was replaced by a shingle roof. In 1893, Cyprian Rubio \"modernized\" the interior of the church, painting over the original artwork; when he finished, little of the old church was untouched. The windows were lengthened, the beamed ceiling and tile floor were covered, and the remnants of the quadrangle were razed. The west sacristy was removed to provide room for a school, which was not actually built until 1921. During the pastorate of Patrick Grogan the roof of the church was once again tiled, the convent and present rectory were built, and a new fountain was placed in the garden.\nThe education of children at Mission San Buenaventura has flourished intermittently since 1829 (during Mexican rule) and continuously since 1922. Originally a four-classroom structure, Holy Cross School served its students and the parish admirably since its 1922 dedication. In 1925 it was expanded to accommodate growth and in 1949 a subsequent renovation brought it out to Main Street (El Camino Real) with no space left for further expansion.\nIn a major restoration under the supervision of Aubrey J. O'Reilly in 1956\u20131957 the windows were reconstructed to their original size, and the ceiling and floor were uncovered. A long-time parishioner commissioned the casting of a bell with an automatic angelus device and donated it to the mission; it hangs in the bell tower above the four ancient hand-operated bells.\nThe second half of the 20th century brought more growth, as well as wear-and-tear and obsolescence, and the school's problems far exceed spatial deficiency. In response to this situation, the San Buenaventura Mission parish, under the leadership of Monsignor Patrick J. O'Brien, formed a Planning and Development Committee comprising parishioners, faculty, parish staff, and parents. In June 1994, the downtown firm of Mainstreet Architects and Planners prepared a conceptual master site plan for the mission properties, incorporating the design of a new school and an adjoining multi-purpose building which would serve both school and parish. This plan also necessitated the deconstruction of the convent and the two remaining Holy Cross Sisters moved into the larger St. Catherine by the Sea Convent, a short distance from the Mission.\nThe entire roof of the church was removed and replaced in 1976. In December of that year the church was solemnly consecrated by Cardinal Timothy Manning, the Archbishop of Los Angeles. In 1982 the mission marked its bicentennial. A new three-story school building, with pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and grades 1\u20138, located at the base of the hill behind the Mission, was dedicated in January 2001. The school also houses the Serra Chapel for Eucharistic Adoration, adult classrooms, a parish/school kitchen, and a large assembly hall used as a school auditorium and for large parish gatherings and one Sunday Mass. The assembly room was named after O'Brien, who was the pastor of the church for 25 years until his sudden death in 2005. The mission celebrated its 225th anniversary with a year-long series of events and activities during 2006\u201307.\nDescription.\nAll that remains of the original mission is the church and its garden. A small museum sits at the mission with displays of Chumash Indian artifacts and mission-era items. Located in the historic downtown of Ventura, very few California missions had the center of business and commerce remain at the location where the mission was established like Mission San Buenaventura.&lt;ref name=\"NYT 2015/09/20\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The church remains an active Catholic parish, serving approximately 2,000 families, and services are still held in the parish church. The current pastor is Tom Elewaut, who has served since 2011. A reproduction of the Pieta at St. Peter's Basilica was donated to the parish in 2018. The Father Serra statue that was removed from the plaza in front of the Ventura City Hall was installed in the garden in 2024.\nMission industries.\nSome animals at San Buenaventura were cattle, horses, sheep, donkeys and goats. The cattle were very important because they provided food, oil and hides. In the year of 1818, 35,274 cattle wandered over the mission lands as far as the Oxnard Plain. A little time after January 7, 1831, the animal population decreased to a low of 4,000 cattle, 3,000 sheep, 300 horses and 60 mules. In July 1839, Inspector-General E.P. Hartnell found 2,208 cattle, 1,670 sheep, 799 horses, 35 mules and 65 goats. The soil around Mission San Buenaventura was very good so the mission could grow many crops. San Buenaventura grew apples, grapes, bananas, pears, plums, pomegranates, figs, oranges, coconuts, beans, grain, corn and barley. In the year of 1818, 12,483 bushels of grain were harvested. Shortly after January 7, 1831, harvests had been reduced to 1,750 bushels of wheat, 2,000 bushels of barley, 500 bushels of corn, and 400 bushels of beans. In July 1839, Inspector-General William E.P. Hartnell found 322 fanegas of wheat, 182 fanegas of corn and 35 fanegas of peas.\nMission bells.\nBells were vitally important to daily life at Mission San Buenaventura, which had five bells. The bells were borrowed from Mission Santa Barbara because there were no bells at the time. They were never returned. The bell facing north is labeled \"S. San Francisco 1781\". The bell facing east has the inscription: \"San Pedro Alcantra 1781\". A small swinging bell hangs in the southern arch with the lettering: \"Ave Maria S. Joseph\". The only bell used daily at San Buenaventura is large and crown topped with a cross on its side. Inscribed on the bell is \"Ave Maria Pruysyma D Sapoyan Ano D 1825\", which means \"Hail Mary Most Pure. Mary of Zapopan Year of 1825.\" This bell was originally cast for the church of Zapopan but was later sent to Mission San Buenaventura. Another bell, which was once the gift of the Spanish Viceroy, is inscribed \"Marquez de Croix Mexico November 12, 1770\". It is currently owned by Senora Isabel del Valle Cram. There are also two wooden bells in the museum that measure about two feet. These were the only wooden bells in the California missions.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Often referred to as the 'Queen of the Missions', it was founded by Padre Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n for the Franciscan order on December 4, 1786, the feast day of Saint Barbara, as the tenth mission of what would later become 21 missions in Alta California.\nMission Santa Barbara, like other California missions, was built as part of a broader effort to consolidate the Spanish claim on Alta California in the face of threats from rival empires. In attempting to do this, Spain sought to turn local indigenous tribes into good Spanish citizens (for Mission Santa Barbara, this was the Chumash-Barbare\u00f1o tribe). This required religious conversion and integration into the Spanish colonial economy \u2013 for the local Chumash people, the environmental changes wrought by the Mission's large herd of livestock, combined with epidemics and military force, meant that tribal members often had little choice but to join the mission system, resulting in a type of forced servitude.\nThe mission is the namesake of the city of Santa Barbara as well as of Santa Barbara County and comes from the legend of Saint Barbara, a girl who was beheaded by her father for following the Christian faith.\nThe Mission grounds occupy a rise between the Pacific Ocean and the Santa Ynez Mountains, and were consecrated by Father Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n, who had taken over the presidency of the California mission chain upon the death of Father Jun\u00edpero Serra. Mission Santa Barbara is, along with mission San Luis Rey, the only mission to remain under the leadership of the Franciscan Friars since its founding, and today is a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\nHistory.\nConstruction and development.\nThe early missionaries built three different chapels during the first few years, each larger than the previous one. In 1787, the first chapel built was a palisaded log structure with a grass roof and an earthen floor that measured x . In 1789, the second chapel was constructed out of adobe with roof tiles and measured x . In 1793\u201394, it was replaced again with another adobe tiled-roof structure that measured x . However, the third chapel was destroyed by the 1812 Santa Barbara earthquake on December 21.\nBy 1815, construction of the fourth Mission structure had begun and was mostly completed by 1820. Most probably under the direction of master stonemason Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ramiez (as estimated by historians), the work was performed by a labor force of Canalino people. The towers were severely damaged in the June 29, 1925, earthquake, but the walls were held intact by the buttresses. Restoration was undertaken the following year. By project completion in 1927, the church had been accurately rebuilt to retain its original design using the original materials to reproduce the walls, columns, and arches. Some years later it was discovered that the concrete foundation of the church had begun to disintegrate while it was settling into the ground, thereby causing the towers to crack. Between 1950 and 1953, the facade and towers were demolished and rebuilt to duplicate their original form. The appearance of the interior of the church has not been altered significantly since 1820.\nRemains of the Mission's original infrastructure constructed primarily by the indentured Chumash people under Franciscan rule are located on the eastern abutting property known as Mission Historical Park, which was sold to the City in 1928. These ruins include tanning vats, a pottery kiln, and a guard house as well as an extensive water distribution system that incorporated aqueducts, a filtration system, two reservoirs, and a hydro-powered gristmill. The larger reservoir, which was built in 1806 by the expedient of damming of Mission Canyon situated to the north within the existing Santa Barbara Botanic Garden, continued to serve as a functioning component of the city's water system until 1993. Also intact near the entrance to the Mission is the original fountain and \"lavadero\".\nRelations with the Chumash tribe.\nMission Santa Barbara was part of a broader plan by the Kingdom of Spain to protect its claim on Alta California against rival colonial powers (Russia and Great Britain). The mission was expected to turn the local indigenous people into upstanding Spanish citizens through conversion to Catholicism and by making them productive members of the Spanish colonial economy.\nThe main economic activity of the missions in the region that was occupied by the local Chumash tribe was animal husbandry and related products (hides and tallow). The average size of the Santa Barbara Mission's herd was a little over 14,000 animals over the 1806\u20131810 period. Large numbers of Chumash workers were required to care for this herd and to serve the other needs of the Mission. At the same time, the herds disrupted the sophisticated Chumash system of hunting and gathering, placing the tribes in an increasingly precarious position and aggravating the existing demographic stress caused by epidemics of European diseases against which the Chumash had no immunity. Thus, the Chumash often had little choice but to join the mission. A modern source describes the lives of indigenous people in the mission system as being 'controlled by the padres'; it also notes that baptised indigenous peoples 'were not allowed to leave without permission'.\nIn 1818, two Argentine ships under the command of the French privateer, Hip\u00f3lito Bouchard approached the coast and threatened the young town of Santa Barbara. The padres, led by Fray Antonio Ripoll armed and trained 180 of the neophytes to mobilize for the anticipated attack. They were organized into an infantry unit comprising one-hundred archers that were reinforced by an additional fifty brandishing machetes, and a cavalry unit of thirty lancers. Father Ripoll named the unit \"\"Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Urbanos Realistas de Santa B\u00e1rbara\".\" With their help, the Presidio soldiers confronted Bouchard, who sailed out of the harbor without attacking.\nDecline of the Chumash population and the Chumash revolt.\nIn 1803, 1,792 Chumash lived as neophytes within 234 adobe huts that surrounded the mission, which was the highest number living onsite during a single year. By 1820, the Mission's Chumash population declined to 1,132 and then dropped to 962 three years later.\nDuring the Chumash revolt of 1824, under the leadership of Andr\u00e9s Sagimomatsee, the mission was briefly seized and looted. The soldiers posted there were disarmed (two of them were wounded with machete blows) and were sent back to the Presidio. After an indecisive battle was fought against troops from the Presidio, most of the Indians withdrew over the Santa Ynez Mountains via Mission Canyon and eventually on to the eastern interior; while fifty others had fled during the night of the uprising to Santa Cruz Island in plank canoes embarking from Mescaltitl\u00e1n.\nFor a few months thereafter, the mission was mostly devoid of any Chumash presence until a pardon agreement was brokered for their return by Father Presidente Vicente Francisco de Sarr\u00eda (sent from Monterrey) and Father Antonio Ripoll (minister of the Santa Barbara Mission). A military expedition, led by Captain Pablo de la Portilla, had been sent in pursuit of the Chumash \"for the purpose of subjugating and restoring to their mission the neophytes of Santa Barbara who had fled to the tulares\". After a seven-day long march from the Presidio, Captain de la Portilla and his division consisting of roughly 104 soldiers equipped with \"caliber-4 cannon\" arrived near Lake Tulares on June 9, 1824, and began negotiations for the surrender of the Indians (who were referred to as the rebels or fugitives); a process that took about six days. The majority of those captured, including many women, children, and elders were marched back on a route leading across the Cuyama Valley and over the mountains southward towards the Santa Barbara Mission through San Roque Canyon on a journey (according to del Portilla's log) lasting from June 15 or 16, until their arrival on June 23 (with \"straggling families\" arriving over the course of subsequent days). An untallied number of elderly and infirmed were reported to have perished along the way. By June 28 of that year, about 816 out of an approximate population of 1,000 had returned to the mission.\nFrom 1836 to 1839 the remaining Chumash residing at the Mission dwindled from 481 to 246. By 1854, records stated that \"only a few Indians were about the area of the mission\". Although there are purportedly no records kept by the Franciscans which offer an explanation of the diminishing trend of the Chumash population, all of the California missions throughout their establishment experienced a mortality rate that exceeded their birthrate. Modern sources attribute this decline to ill-treatment, overwork, malnutrition, violence and disease.\nPost-secularization.\nAfter the Mexican Congress passed \" An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California\" on August 17, 1833, Father Presidente Narciso Dur\u00e1n transferred the missions' headquarters to Santa Barbara, thereby making Mission Santa Barbara the repository of some 3,000 original documents that had been scattered through the California missions.\nIn 1840, Alta California and Baja California Territory were removed from the Diocese of Sonora to form the Diocese of Both Californias. Bishop Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno, OFM, established his cathedra at Mission Santa Barbara, making the chapel the pro-cathedral of the diocese until 1849. Under Bishop Thaddeus Amat y Brusi, C.M., the chapel again served as a pro-cathedral, for the Diocese of Monterey and then the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, from 1853 to 1876. It is for this reason that of all the California missions, only the chapel at Mission Santa Barbara has two matching bell towers. At that time, that particular architectural feature was restricted to a cathedral church.\nWhen President Abraham Lincoln restored the missions to the Catholic Church on March 18, 1865, the Mission's leader at the time, Friar Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio, came into conflict with Bishop Amat over the matter of whether the Mission should be under the ownership of the Franciscan order rather than the diocese. Bishop Amat refused to give the deed for the Mission to the Franciscans, but in 1925, Bishop John J. Cantwell finally awarded the deed to them.\nAs the center for the Franciscans, the Mission played an important role in education in the late 1900s and early twentieth century. From 1854 to 1885 it was chartered as an apostolic college and from 1869 to 1877 it also functioned as a college for laymen, Thereby making it Santa Barbara's first institution of higher education. In 1896, this education initiative led to the creation of a high school seminary program that in 1901 would become a separate institution, Saint Anthony's Seminary. In 1929 the college level program was relocated to Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and would become San Luis Rey College from 1950 to 1968 before relocating to Berkeley, California what is today the Franciscan School of Theology (FST).\nContemporary uses.\nThe City of Santa Barbara originally developed between the Mission proper and the harbor, specifically near El Presidio Re\u00e1l de Santa B\u00e1rbara (the \"Royal Spanish Presidio\"), about a mile southeast of the Mission. As the city grew, it extended throughout the coastal plain. A residential area now surrounds the Mission with public parks (Mission Historical Park and Rocky Nook Park) and a few public buildings (such as the Natural History Museum) in the adjacent area.\nMission Santa Barbara includes a gift shop, a museum, a Franciscan Friary, and a retreat house. The Mission grounds are a tourist attraction. The Mission is owned by the Franciscan Province of Santa Barbara and the parish church rents the church from the Franciscans. For many decades in the late 20th century, Fr. Virgil Cordano, OFM served as the pastor of the St. Barbara's Parish co-located on the grounds of the Santa Barbara Mission. He died in 2008. Since the summer of 2017, the Mission has served as the Interprovincial Novitiate for the English Speaking Provinces of the Franciscan Friars (Observants).\nThe Mission also houses the Santa Barbara Mission-Archive Library, which collects and preserves 'historical and cultural resources pertaining to Franciscan history and Missions and the communities with which they interacted, especially in Colonial New Spain, Northwestern Mexico, and the Southwestern United States.' The sources of the Library's collections can be traced to the 1760s with Fray Junipero Serra's plans for missions in Alta California. The collections include named sections, the Junipero Serra Collection (1713\u20131947), the California Mission Documents (1640\u20131853), and the Apostolic College collection (1853\u20131885). The Archive-Library also has a large collection of early California writings, maps, and images as well as a collection of materials for the Tohono O'oodham Indians of Arizona. Beginning with the writings of Hubert Howe Bancroft, the Library has served as a center for historical study of the missions for more than a century. It is an independent non-profit educational and research institution that is separate from Mission Santa Barbara, but occupies a portion of the Mission complex. Some Franciscans serve on the Board of Trustees along with scholars and community members; the institution is directed by a lay academic scholar.\nThe Mission also has the oldest unbroken tradition of choral singing among the California Missions and, indeed, of any California institution. The weekly Catholic liturgy is serviced by two choirs, the California Mission Schola and the Cappella Barbara. The Mission archives contain one of the richest collections of colonial Franciscan music manuscripts known today, which remain closely guarded (most have not yet been subjected to scholarly analysis).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It belongs to the fungus family Hymenogastraceae and was previously known as Stropharia cubensis. It is the best-known psilocybin mushroom due to its wide distribution and ease of cultivation.\nTaxonomy.\nThe species was first described in 1906 as \"Stropharia cubensis\" by American mycologist Franklin Sumner Earle in Cuba. In 1907, it was identified as \"Naematoloma caerulescens\" in Tonkin (now Vietnam) by French pharmacist and mycologist Narcisse Th\u00e9ophile Patouillard, while in 1941, it was called \"Stropharia cyanescens\" by William Alphonso Murrill near Gainesville in Florida. German-born mycologist Rolf Singer moved the species into the genus \"Psilocybe\" in 1949, giving it the binomial name \"Psilocybe cubensis\". The synonyms were later also assigned to the species \"Psilocybe cubensis\".\nThe name \" Psilocybe \" is derived from the Ancient Greek roots \"psilos\" (\u03c8\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2) and \"kub\u00ea\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b2\u03b7), and translates as \"bare head\". \"Cubensis\" means \"coming from Cuba\", and refers to the type locality published by Earle.\nSinger divided \"P. cubensis\" into three varieties: the nominate, which usually had a brownish cap, Murrill's \"cyanescens\" from Florida, which generally had a pale cap, and var \"caerulascens\" from Indochina with a more yellowish cap.\n\"Psilocybe cubensis\" is commonly known as gold top, golden top or gold cap in Australia, sacred mushroom or blue mushroom in Brazil, and San Ysidro or Palenque mushroom in the United States and Mexico, while the term \"magic mushroom\" has been applied to hallucinogenic mushrooms in general. It is commonly known as \"Golden teacher\" in South Africa. A common name in Thai is \"Hed keequai\", which translates as \"mushroom which appears after water buffalo defecates\".\nBetween 2013 and 2022, several samples of an unknown species of \"Psilocybe\" mushroom were collected. These samples bore similar superficial characteristics to \"P. cubensis\", as well as similar habit and habitat. Microscopic and genetic testing of these samples led to the conclusion that they were closely related but different species, estimated to have shared a common ancestor some time in the last 3 million years. The new species bears the provisional name \"Psilocybe ochraceocentrata\".\nDescription.\nThe cap is , conic to convex with a central papilla when young, becoming broadly convex to plane with age, retaining a slight umbo sometimes surrounded by a ring-shaped depression. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, sometimes with white universal veil remnants attached. The cap is brown becoming paler to almost white at the margin and fades to more golden-brown or yellowish with age. When bruised, all parts of the mushroom stain blue. The narrow grey gills are adnate to adnexed, sometimes seceding attachment, and darken to purplish-black and somewhat mottled with age. The gill edges remain whitish. The hollow white stipe is high by thick, becoming yellowish in age. The well-developed veil leaves a persistent white membranous ring whose surface usually becomes the same color as the gills because of falling spores. The fruiting bodies are 90% water. The mushroom has no odor and has been described as tasting farinaceous, with an alkaline or metallic aftertaste. The spores are 11.5\u201317.3 x 8\u201311.5\u00a0\u03bcm, sub-ellipsoid, basidia 4-spored but sometimes 2- or 3-, pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia present.\nSimilar species.\nThe related species \"Psilocybe subcubensis\"\u2014found in tropical regions\u2014is indistinguishable but has smaller spores. \"Panaeolus semiovatus\" can appear similar but does not stain.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Psilocybe cubensis\" is a pan-tropical species, occurring in the Gulf Coast states and southeastern United States, Mexico, in the Central American countries of Belize, Costa Rica, Panam\u00e1, El Salvador and Guatemala, the Caribbean countries Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guadalupe, Martinique, and Trinidad, in the South American countries of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Paraguay, Uruguay and Peru, Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Malaysia, India, Australia, Fiji, and possibly Nepal and Hawaii.\n\"Psilocybe cubensis\" is found on cow (and occasionally horse) dung, sugar cane mulch or rich pasture soil, with mushrooms appearing from February to December in the northern hemisphere, and November to April in the southern hemisphere. In Asia, the species grows on water buffalo dung. Along with other fungi that grow on cow dung, \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" is thought to have colonized Australia with the introduction of cattle there, 1800 of which were on the Australian mainland by 1803\u2014having been transported there from the Cape of Good Hope, Kolkata and the American west coast. In Australia, the species grows between northern Queensland to southern New South Wales.\nIn March 2018, several \"Psilocybe cubensis\" specimens were collected in Zimbabwe in the Wedza District of Mashonaland East province, approx. 120\u00a0km \u00a0southeast of Harare. This was the first reported occurrence of a psilocybin mushroom in Zimbabwe. The mushrooms were collected on Imire Rhino &amp; Wildlife Conservation\u2014a nature reserve that is home to both wildlife and cattle, as well as cattle egrets.\nRelationship with cattle.\nBecause \"Psilocybe cubensis\" is intimately associated with cattle ranching, the fungus has found unique dispersal niches not available to most other members of the family Hymenogastraceae. Of particular interest is the cattle egret (\"Bubulcus ibis\"), a colonizer of Old World origin (via South America), whose range of distribution overlaps much of that of \"Psilocybe cubensis.\" Cattle egrets typically walk alongside cattle, preying on insects; they track through spore-laden vegetation and cow dung and transfer the spores to suitable habitats, often thousands of miles away during migration activities. This type of spore dispersal is known as zoochory, and it enables a parent species to propagate over a much greater range than it could achieve alone. The relationship between cattle, cattle egrets, and \"Psilocybe cubensis\" is an example of symbiosis\u2014a situation in which dissimilar organisms live together in close association.\nCultivation.\n\"Psilocybe cubensis\" grows naturally in tropical and subtropical conditions, often near cattle due to the ideal conditions they provide for the growth of the fungus. The cow usually consumes grains or grass covered with the spores of \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" and the fungus will begin to germinate within the dung.\nMushrooms such as \"Psilocybe cubensis\" are relatively easy to cultivate indoors. First, spores are inoculated within sterilized jars or bags, colloquially known as grainspawn, containing a form of carbohydrate nutrient such as rye grains. After approximately one month, the spores fully colonize the grain spawn forming dense mycelium, which is then planted within a bulk substrate such as a coconut husk fiber and vermiculite mixture. Given proper humidity, temperature, and fresh air exchange, the substrate will produce fruiting \"Psilocybe cubensis\" bodies within a month of planting. To preserve potency after harvesting, growers often dehydrate the fruit and store them in air-tight containers in cool environments.\nA study conducted in 2009 showed that mushrooms grown in the dark had higher levels of psilocybin and psilocin compared to the mushrooms grown in bright, indirect light, which had minimum levels.\nStudies were conducted where an environmentally controlled wind tunnel and a computer program were used to determine the influence of humidity on the individual basidiocarps of \"P.\"\u00a0\"cubensis\" which aided in mapping their growth and development. The transpiration and growth of the mushroom were heavily influenced by the humidity of the air, and the transpiration was accelerated at higher humidities while light did not affect the growth. Faster growth was observed at higher humidities. It was also discovered that misting enhanced both the growth and transpiration rates in the growing process of \"P.\u00a0cubensis\".\nSmall-scale cultivation of \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" is often accomplished with \"cakes\" that colonize within jars, but fruit inside specially designed tubs called \"shotgun fruiting chambers\". The most common cake method for beginners is PF-Tek (\"Psilocybe Fanaticus technique\"), named after Psylocybe Fanaticus, the clandestine cultivator credited for its creation. Cakes are popular for the new cultivator because of their simplicity and low cost of startup materials. As cakes are composed of brown rice flour, vermiculite, and gypsum, they can be steam-sterilized in a large pot. Unlike cereal grains used in bulk growing, brown rice flour contains no bacterial endospores, a contamination vector requiring a pressure cooker to sterilize.\nThe \"Spiderman Tek\" is a growing method using microwavable rice sachets.\nCultivation methods resulting in larger yields are categorized as \"bulk growing\". Bulk growing allows cultivators to operate on a larger scale, but require a greater investment of time, money, and knowledge. While small-scale grows utilize spore syringes to inject spore solution into cakes, bulk methods instead use grain spawn as primary nutrition for the subsequent growth. Additionally, cultivators must develop solid sterile technique in working with agar. Instead of inoculating grain with spores, growers instead germinate spores on agar plates, then transfer the resultant healthy mycelium to the grain jars. Once the grain is colonized with clean mycelial growth, users inoculate their bulk substrates with the grain in a process known as \"spawning.\" Bulk substrates are frequently a mix of coir, vermiculite and gypsum due to not requiring pasteurization or sterilization. However, some utilize blends of manure-based substrates or straw; substrates which always require pasteurization with open-air spawning. After spawning, the healthy mycelium will colonize the bulk substrate, and given proper conditions, eventually fruit mushrooms.\nTerence and Dennis McKenna made \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" particularly famous when they published \"Psilocybin: Magic Mushroom Grower's Guide\" in the 1970s upon their return from the Amazon rainforest, having deduced new methods (based on pre-existing techniques originally described by J.P. San Antonio) for growing psilocybin mushrooms and assuring their audience that \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" were amongst the easiest psilocybin-containing mushrooms to cultivate.\nThe potency of cultivated specimens can vary widely per each flush (harvest). In a classic paper published by Jeremy Bigwood and M.W. Beug, it was shown that with each flush, psilocybin levels varied somewhat unpredictably but were much the same on the first flush as they were on the last flush; however, psilocin was typically absent in the first two flushes but peaked by the fourth flush, making it the most potent. Two strains were also analyzed to determine potency in caps and stems: In one strain the caps contained generally twice as much psilocybin as the stems, but the small amount of psilocin present was entirely in the stems. In the other strain, a trace of psilocin was present in the cap but not in the stem; the cap and stem contained equal amounts of psilocybin. The study concluded that the levels of psilocybin and psilocin vary by over a factor of four in cultures of \"P.\u00a0cubensis\" grown under controlled conditions.\nPsychedelic and entheogenic use.\nSinger noted in 1949 that \"Psilocybe cubensis\" had psychoactive properties.\nIn Australia, the use of psychoactive mushrooms grew rapidly between 1969 and 1975.\nIn a 1992 paper, locals and tourists in Thailand were reported to consume \"P. cubensis\" and related species in mushroom omelets\u2014particularly in Ko Samui and Ko Pha-ngan. At times, omelets were adulterated with LSD, resulting in prolonged intoxication. A thriving subculture had developed in the region. Other localities, such as Hat Yai, Ko Samet, and Chiang Mai, also had some reported usage.\nIn 1996, jars of honey containing \"Psilocybe cubensis\" were confiscated at the Dutch-German border. Upon examination, it was revealed that jars of honey containing psychedelic mushrooms were being sold at Dutch coffee shops.\n\"P. cubensis\" is one of the most widely known of the psilocybin-containing mushrooms used for triggering psychedelic experiences after ingestion.\nIts major alkaloids are:\nThe potential psychoactivity of other compounds other than psilocybin and psilocin has been speculated but not confirmed.\nThe concentrations of psilocin and psilocybin, as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, are in the range of 0.14\u20130.42% (wet weight) and 0.37\u20131.30% (dry weight) in the whole mushroom 0.17\u20130.78% (wet weight) and 0.44\u20131.35% (dry weight) in the cap, and 0.09%\u20130.30% (wet weight) and 0.05\u20131.27% (dry weight) in the stem, respectively. For quickly and practically measuring the psychoactive contents of most healthy \"Psilocybe cubensis\" varieties, it can generally be assumed that there is approximately 15\u00a0mg (+/- 5\u00a0mg) of psilocybin per gram of dried mushroom. Furthermore, due to factors such as age and storage method, the psilocybin and psilocin content of a given sample of mushrooms will vary.\nIndividual body composition, brain chemistry and psychological predisposition play a significant role in determining appropriate doses. For a modest psychedelic effect, a minimum of one gram of dried \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushrooms is ingested orally, 0.25\u20131\u00a0gram is usually sufficient to produce a mild effect, 1\u20132.5\u00a0grams usually provides a moderate effect and 2.5\u00a0grams and higher usually produces strong effects. For most people, 3.5 dried grams (1/8 oz) would be considered a high dose and may produce an intense experience; this is, however, typically considered a standard dose among recreational users. Body composition (usually weight) should be taken into account when calculating dosage. For many individuals, doses above three\u00a0grams may be overwhelming. For a few rare people, doses as small as 0.25\u00a0gram can produce full-blown effects normally associated with very high doses. For most people, however, that dose level would have virtually no effects.\nThere are many different ways to ingest \"Psilocybe cubensis\". Users may prefer to take them raw, freshly harvested, or dried and preserved. It is also possible to prepare culinary dishes such as pasta or tea with the mushrooms. However, the psychoactive compounds begin to break down rapidly at temperatures exceeding 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F). Another method of ingestion known as \"Lemon Tekking\" involves combining pulverized \"Psilocybe cubensis\" with a concentrated citrus juice with a pH of ~2. Many users believe that a considerable amount of the psilocybin will have been dephosphorylated into psilocin, the psychoactive metabolite, by citric acid. However, this claim is not substantiated by the literature on the metabolism of psilocybin, as dephosphorylation is known to be mediated by the enzyme alkaline phosphatase in humans. It is therefore more likely that citric acid mostly helps in breakdown of mushroom cells, aiding in digestion and psilocybin release.\nThe \"Lemon Tekk\" method of consumption results in a more rapid onset and can offer easier digestion or reduced \"come-up pressure\" associated with raw consumption.\nUpon ingestion, effects usually begin after approximately 20\u201360 minutes (depending on the method of ingestion and stomach contents) and may last from four to ten hours, depending on dosage, potency of cultivar, and individual biochemistry. Visual distortions often occur, including walls that seem to breathe, a vivid enhancement of colors, and the animation of organic shapes.\nThe effects of high doses can be overwhelming depending on the particular phenotype of cubensis, grow method, and the individual. It is recommended not to eat wild mushrooms without properly identifying them as they may be poisonous. In particular, similar species include mushrooms of the genus \"Galerina\" and \"Pholiotina rugosa\"\u2014all potentially deadly\u2014and \"Chlorophyllum molybdites\". All of these grow in pastures, a similar habitat to that preferred by \"P. cubensis\".\nIn 2019, a 15-year-old boy suffered from transient kidney failure after eating \"P. cubensis\" from a cultivation kit in Canada. No one else in the group suffered any ill effects.\nLegality.\nPsilocybin and psilocin are listed as Schedule I drugs under the United Nations 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances. However, mushrooms containing psilocybin and psilocin are not illegal in some parts of the world. For example, in Brazil they are legal, but extractions from the mushroom containing psilocybin and psilocin remain illegal. In the United States, growing or possessing \"Psilocybe cubensis\" mushrooms is illegal in all states, but it is legal to possess and buy the spores for microscopy purposes. However, Denver, Colorado, decriminalized them for those 21 and up on May 8, 2019. Oakland, California, followed suit, decriminalizing psilocybin-containing mushrooms as well as the peyote cactus on June 4, 2019. Santa Cruz, California, decriminalized naturally occurring psychedelics, including psilocybin mushrooms, on January 29, 2020. On November 3, 2020, the state of Oregon decriminalized possession of psilocybin mushrooms for recreational use and granted licensed practitioners permission to administer psilocybin mushrooms to individuals age 21 years and older.\nIn 1978, the Florida Supreme Court ruled in \"Fiske vs Florida\" that possession of psilocybin mushrooms is not illegal, in that the mushrooms cannot be considered a \"container\" for psilocybin based on how the law is written, i.e., it does not specifically state that psilocybin mushrooms themselves are illegal, but that the hallucinogenic constituents in them are. According to this decision, the applicable statute as framed imparts no information as to which plants may contain psilocybin in its natural state and does not advise a person of ordinary intelligence that this substance is contained in a particular variety of mushroom. The statute, therefore, cannot constitutionally be applied to the appellant.\nThe production, sale and possession of magic mushrooms is illegal in Canada.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established on December 8, 1787 (the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, hence the mission's name) by the Franciscan order. The original mission complex south of Lompoc was destroyed by an earthquake in 1812, and the mission was rebuilt at its present site a few miles to the northeast.\nThe mission is part of the larger La Pur\u00edsima Mission State Historic Park, part of the California State Parks system, and along with Mission San Francisco de Solano is one of only two of the Spanish missions in California that is no longer governed by the Catholic Church. It is currently the only example in California of a complete Spanish Catholic mission complex, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1970.\nHistory.\nOriginal mission.\nMission La Pur\u00edsima was originally established at a site known to the Chumash people as Algsacpi and to the Spanish as the plain of R\u00edo Santa Rosa, one mile south of Lompoc. (During the mission period, the Chumash spoke the Purisime\u00f1o language.) The Viceroyalty of New Spain made an exception to the rule that no California mission was to be established within seven miles of any pueblo in Las Californias, as Lompoc was so small. The site was the location of the mission from its founding on December 8, 1787, by Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n till it was destroyed by the 1812 Ventura earthquake on December 12, 1812. The original mission was associated with the Presidio of Santa Barbara. Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n (1736\u20131803) was a Spanish Franciscan missionary to Alta California and the president of the Franciscan missions. He was the founder of nine of the twenty-one Spanish missions in California including original Mission La Pur\u00edsima, the 11th mission.\nBy 1803, the Mission Indian population had increased, by Indian Reductions, to 1,436 Chumash people. At the mission there were also 3,230 cattle, 5,400 sheep, 306 horses, and 39 mules. In the same year, there was a harvest of 690 fanegas of wheat, corn and beans (a fanega equaling about 220 pounds).\nThe mission grew from its founding to be 330 feet square quadrangle made of adobe bricks. The original mission had many rooms for the two priests, the evangelized Chumash and for a chapel, six soldiers, married Indians and unmarried females. At its peak about 1,520 Chumash Indian lived at the mission. The original mission was south of the Santa Ynez River and included vast crop and grazing lands.\nAn earthquake on December 21, 1812, severely damaged the mission buildings.\nThe site became a California State Historical Landmark No. 928 on June 29, 1979. Ruins of the original mission are at 508 South F Street, near East Locust Avenue in Lompoc, California. The California State Historical Landmark reads:\n\"NO. 928 SITE OF ORIGINAL MISSION AND REMAINING RUINS OF BUILDINGS OF MISSION DE LA PUR\u00cdSIMA CONCEPCI\u00d3N DE MAR\u00cdA SANTISIMA - The ruins at this site are part of the original Mission La Pur\u00edsima, founded by Padre Ferm\u00edn de Lasu\u00e9n on December 8, 1787, as the 11th in the chain of Spanish Missions in California. The mission was destroyed by earthquake on December 12, 1812, the present Mision (mission) La Purisima was then established several miles away. \" \nSecond mission.\nMariano Payeras received permission to relocate the mission community to the northeast in La Ca\u00f1ada de los Berros, next to El Camino Real. La Pur\u00edsima Mission was officially established in its new location on April 23, 1813. Materials salvaged from the buildings destroyed by the earthquake were used to construct the new buildings four miles northeast of the pueblo at their present location, which was known to the Chumash as Am\u00fau, and to the Spanish as La Ca\u00f1ada de los Berros. The buildings were completed within ten years.\nChumash revolt of 1824.\nAfter Mexico won the Mexican War of Independence in 1823, Spanish funding ceased to the Santa Barbara Presidio. Many soldiers at the mission who were no longer being paid by the new Mexican government took out their frustrations on the local Chumash Indians. After a soldier apparently beat an Indian at nearby Mission Santa In\u00e9s, the Chumash revolt of 1824 began at that mission. It spread to La Pur\u00edsima Mission, where the Chumash people took over the mission for one month until more soldiers arrived from Monterey Presidio. The Chumash lost their hold on the mission with many leaving the mission soon thereafter. Many of the Indians who had sought refuge in the neighboring mountains during the revolt returned to the mission.\nFollowing independent Mexico's secularization of the Alta California missions from 1834 to 1843, the buildings of La Pur\u00edsima Mission were abandoned. The Mexican government, which had gained independence from Spain, transferred control of the missions from the Catholic Church to civil authorities. The property passed into private ownership and the mission buildings fell into ruin; the lands were granted to the Rancho Ex-Mission la Purisima.\n20th century.\nIn 1933 the Union Oil Company deeded several parcels to the State of California. By 1934, only nine of the buildings remained intact.\nIn the 20th century, under direction of the National Park Service, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) pledged to restore the mission if enough land could be provided to convert it into a historic landmark. The Catholic Church and the Union Oil Company donated sufficient land for the CCC to proceed with the restoration. The nine buildings as well as many small structures and the original water system were fully restored with the mission's dedication occurring on December 7, 1941, the same day the United States entered World War II. Today, La Pur\u00edsima Mission is the only example in California of a complete mission complex.\nAs of 2011 it was considered to be the most completely restored Spanish mission in California. Ten of the original buildings are fully restored and furnished, including the church, shops, quarters, and blacksmith shop. The mission gardens and livestock represent what would have been found at the mission during the 1820s. Special living history events are scheduled throughout the year. A visitor center features information, displays and artifacts, and a self-guided tour gives visitors the opportunity to step back in time for a glimpse of a brief, turbulent period in California's history.\nIn 2025, the mission was a filming location for the Paul Thomas Anderson directed \"One Battle After Another\" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Chase Infiniti.\nLa Pur\u00edsima Mission State Historic Park.\nLa Pur\u00edsima Mission is now part of the La Pur\u00edsima Mission State Historic Park within the California State Parks System. Located outside Lompoc, California, the park was established in 1935. With a visitor center and guided tours, the historic park is maintained by the California Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR). La Pur\u00edsima is located in Lompoc, in the county of Santa Barbara, California.\nLa Pur\u00edsima Mission State Historic Park was one of many state parks threatened with closure in 2008. Those closures were ultimately avoided by cutting hours and maintenance system-wide.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Mission of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross) is a replica Spanish Californian mission in Santa Cruz, California. Located on the San Lorenzo River floodplain below what would later be named Mission Hill, the mission was founded on August 28, 1791, by Father Ferm\u00edn Francisco de Lasu\u00e9n, the successor to Father Junipero Serra. The mission was dedicated that same year but, in the winter rainy season, the river overflowed its banks and flooded the mission compound. The mission was then relocated to the top of Mission Hill.\nAfter earthquake damage and years of neglect, this second mission fell into disrepair, and much of it, though not all, was removed to accommodate the construction of the Holy Cross Church in 1889. A scaled-down replica was constructed in the 1930s, which today functions as a historical monument and chapel for the parish.\nNear the replica chapel stands the one surviving Mission Santa Cruz Mission building, an adobe structure built between 1822 and 1824. This adobe building served as housing for Indigenous families who, after being converted to Catholicism, lived and worked at the Mission. It is the oldest surviving structure in Santa Cruz County and the best preserved Native American residence at any of the Alta California missions. It is now part of Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park.\nHistory.\nThe outpost was originally established near the Uypi village of \"Aulintak\", located near the mouth of the San Lorenzo River, on August 28, 1791. There the Franciscan brothers erected a tent for worship to bring Christianity to the Awaswas people. The settlement was named for the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross, adopting the name given to a nearby creek by the missionary priest Juan Crespi, who accompanied the explorer Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 when he camped on the San Lorenzo River on October 17, 1769.\nThe original mission was a small structure dedicated on September 25, 1791. It was located on the bottom of what would become Mission Hill, near what is today the intersection of River and North Pacific Streets, on the San Lorenzo River's flood plains. The mission was flooded as the river swelled with the rains that winter. Over the next three years until 1793, the padres rebuilt the mission on the hill overlooking the river.\nAs with the other California missions, Mission Santa Cruz served as a site for ecclesiastical conversion of natives, first the Amah Mutsun people, the original inhabitants of the region (called \"Coste\u00f1o\" by the Spaniards, and later known as the \"Ohlone\"). Later, Yokuts people were brought from the east. The settlement was the site of the first autopsy in Alta California.\nIt was one of the smaller missions, in the fourth military district under protection of the Presidio of San Francisco.\nIn 1797, the secular \"pueblo\" (town) of Branciforte was founded across the San Lorenzo River to the east of Mission Santa Cruz. The mission padres did not welcome the location of the pueblo so close to the mission, and accused the Branciforte settlers of gambling, smuggling and tempting the native acolytes to desert the mission.\nOn October 12, 1812, Father Andr\u00e9s Quintana was strangled to death by mission neophytes, angry over his use of a metal-tipped whip in the punishment of laborers, Native Americans, and Native children.\nIn 1818, the Mission received advance warning of an attack by the Argentine corsair (simply a pirate, from the Spanish point of view) Hip\u00f3lito Bouchard and was evacuated. The citizens of Branciforte, several of whom were retired soldiers, were asked to protect the Mission's valuables; instead, they were later accused (by the priests) of stealing. The people from the mission then decided to flee the mission, and they later arrived in a new mission.\nOne of the only surviving first-person descriptions by a native Californian of life in a mission was given in an interview by Lorenzo Asisara in 1877. Asisara was born at Mission Santa Cruz in 1819. His father was one of the neophytes involved in the Quintana killing, and Asisara repeated the story his father had told him about those events.\nDecline.\nThe front wall of the adobe mission, built in 1794, was destroyed by the 1857 Fort Tejon earthquake. A wooden facade was added and the structure converted to other uses. A new wooden church was built next door in 1858. In 1889, the current Gothic Revival-style Holy Cross Church was built over (in the same orientation) part of the original sanctuary and cemetery. The cemetery wall was defined in 1993 and developed as a memorial and native plant garden.\nThe current Holy Cross Church was built on the site of the original mission church in 1889, and it remains an active parish of the Diocese of Monterey. A section of stone foundation wall from one of the mission buildings and a few old headstones from the mission cemetery can be found directly behind the present Holy Cross Church. A reduced-scale \"replica\" chapel was built near the mission site in the 1930s and functions as a chapel of Holy Cross Church. Today's Plaza Park occupies the same location as the original plaza, at the center of the former mission complex. The complex at one time included as many as 32 buildings. The only surviving mission building, a dormitory for native acolytes, has been restored to its original appearance and functions as a museum of the Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park.\nAt the same time, the mission cemetery was excavated and the remains moved to a mass grave at Old Holy Cross Cemetery, a few miles to the east. In recent years, a group of local volunteers worked to restore the old cemetery, and to identify the mission gravesite and those whose remains were moved there. A memorial was dedicated in 2016.\nThe only original Mission building left is a long multi-room building which at one time housed local \"Yokuts\" and \"Ohlone\" Native American families. The original building is located at 144 School Street and can be toured during operating hours. There is also a protected remnant of the mission church foundation wall behind the current Holy Cross Church. The parish address is 126 High Street. The road leading to the mission from the west is called Mission Street, which is also part of California State Route 1.\nIn 1931, Gladys Sullivan Doyle proposed to construct a reduced-size replica of the original chapel. She contributed all of the construction costs, on the condition that she be allowed to be buried inside. Her grave can be viewed in a small side room. Since there were no surviving photographs or drawings of the original structure, design of the replica chapel was adapted from an 1876 (19 years after the collapse of the building's front half) painting by the French painter L\u00e9on Trousset. The original painting hangs in the nave of the chapel.\nThe concrete construction was done by parishioner Tranquilino Costella, an Italian immigrant, whose contractor stamp is still seen in the sidewalk in front of the mission. The small replica chapel is mainly used for private services, daily Masses (M-F), and Morning Prayer on Saturday. An adjoining room functions as a gift shop. A stone fountain from the original mission complex stands in the garden behind the gift shop.\nSanta Cruz Mission Historic Park and District.\nThe only surviving original adobe mission building, a dormitory for Native American residents, has been restored as part of the Santa Cruz Mission State Historic Park as the Neary-Rodriguez Adobe. The Santa Cruz Mission is designated California Historical Landmark number 342.\nThe Neary-Rodriguez Adobe was added to the National Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Cruz County, California as site number 75000484 on February 24, 1975,\nand the Mission Hill Area as a United States Historic District as site number 76000530 on May 17, 1976.\nUnidentified adobe foundations.\nThe stone foundations of an unidentified adobe on the east edge of Mission Hill in Santa Cruz was first discovered in 1978. Prior to any excavations an extensive archival research program was carried out. After no mention was found in the written record, the foundations were given the name the \"Lost Adobe\". Archaeological excavations (from 1981 to 1984) indicated the presence of 18+ rooms structural foundations extending west toward the original church and cemetery. Artifacts found were a diverse collection of Spanish Mission Era/ Mexican Republic materials including glass beads, Majolica ceramic fragments and phoenix buttons. These findings suggest that the structure was used to house the neophyte community of \"Yokuts\" and \"Ohlone\" families living at the Mission in the 1820s and 1830s. The Lost Adobe collapsed during the 19th century and no remnants remain. The area is on private property and visitors are not allowed.\nMission Hill train tunnel.\nMission Santa Cruz has a hidden single track gated railroad tunnel running under it. Railroad train service used to connect Oakland to Santa Cruz with a train going down the middle of Pacific Avenue on the way to the wharf. In 1876 South Pacific Coast Railroad built a railroad tunnel under Mission Santa Cruz to reroute train traffic out of the busy downtown corridor. The entrance can be found at the end of Amat Street with the tunnel going under the church's parking lot and Emmett Street, and emerging at Chestnut Street. This is still an active rail line for Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific Railway connecting Santa Cruz with Felton.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was the thirteenth of California's Spanish missions, and is named for Mary, Our Lady of Solitude. The town of Soledad is named for the mission.\nAfter the 1835 secularization of the mission and the later sale of building materials, the mission fell into a state of disrepair and soon after was left in ruins.

By 1803, there were 627 Mission Indians at Mission Soledad. At the Mission many Chalon married local Esselen speakers, while others married Yokuts were brought into the mission between 1806 and 1834.\nThe mission's herds numbered 1,150 cattle, about 5,000 sheep, 30 swine, 670 horses, and 40 mules. Spanish Governor Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga was buried in the chapel after he died on July 24, 1814, during a visit to the Mission.\nThe mission was inundated by floods in 1824, 1828, and 1832, and following secularization (when Pio Pico sold the mission for a reported $800), the remaining buildings were looted for supplies. The mission's land became Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad.\nRestoration and reconstruction.\nIn 1954, when the Mission Soledad restoration was begun, only piles of adobe dirt and a few wall sections from the \"cuadr\u00e1ngulo\" (quadrangle) remained. The chapel was reconstructed and dedicated under the auspices of the Native Daughters of the Golden West on October 9, 1955. The ruins of the quadrangle, cemetery, and some of the outer rooms, while not restored, can still be seen. Governor Arrillaga's grave was identified and given a new marker.\nThe Mission Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Soledad is now a functioning Catholic chapel and public museum.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded on June 11, 1797, by the Franciscan order and was the fourteenth Spanish mission established in California. The Mission entered a long period of gradual decline after Mexican secularization act of 1833. After suffering decline, neglect and earthquakes most of the mission was in ruins. Restoration efforts in the intervening periods have reconstructed many of the original structures. The old mission church remains in use as a chapel of Saint Joseph Catholic Church, a parish of the Diocese of Oakland. The museum also features a visitor center, museum, and slide show telling the history of the mission.\nHistory.\nThe original site considered by Juan Cresp\u00ed in 1772 for what was to become Mission San Jos\u00e9 was in what is today known as the San Ramon Valley. However, the Native Americans living in that area were very hostile towards the Spanish, so it was decided to locate the Mission farther south, in an area that is now part of Fremont, California.\nWork on the site of Mission San Jose commenced in May 1797, many years after Cresp\u00ed's death, by Native American people from Mission Santa Clara, to the south, under the direction of Franciscan missionaries and secular Hispanic overseers. The location, on slopes overlooking the Fremont plain on the east side of San Francisco Bay, had been inhabited for countless generations by Indians who spoke the San Francisco Bay Ohlone language. The Ohlone lived a hunting and wild-plant harvesting lifestyle. Their food included seeds, roots, berries, the flour from acorns, small game, deer, fish, and shellfish. In 1797 most of the Indians, from the immediate vicinity of the mission site had already been baptized at Mission Santa Clara during the 1780s and early 1790s. It was these people who returned home to form the founding population of the new community. Mission San Jos\u00e9's walls were thick. The church is long, wide, high; made of adobe and redwood, the floor and the wall are made of tiles.\nBy the end of 1800, the neophyte population had risen to 277, including both Ohlone and Bay Miwok speakers. By the end of 1805, all Indians of the East Bay south of Carquinez Strait were at the missions. After a devastating measles epidemic that reduced the mission population by one quarter in 1806, people from more distant areas and new language groups began to join the Mission San Jose community. The first such language group was the Yokuts or Yokutsan, whose speakers began to move to Mission San Jos\u00e9 from the San Joaquin Valley in 1810. Members of two more language groups, the Coast Miwok from present Sonoma County and Patwin from present Napa and Solano counties, moved down to Mission San Jose in the 1812\u20131818 period, but in smaller numbers than the Yokuts. By 1825 Delta Yokuts was the dominant language in the multilingual community of 1,796 people. Over the next few years speakers of yet another language group, Plains Miwok, moved to the mission from the north side of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. By the time Mission San Jose was closed as an agricultural commune in the mid-1830s, Plains Miwok was the predominant native language among its neophyte Indian people.\nFather Narciso Dur\u00e1n became the pastor of the mission in 1806 and remained until he was replaced by Father Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio in February 1833 as part of a post-independence policy requiring the replacement of Spanish-born clerics with those born in Mexico. Dur\u00e1n trained the neophytes in music, organizing both a choir and a 30-piece orchestra that became famous throughout California. While at San Jos\u00e9, Father Dur\u00e1n twice served as Father-Presidente of the Franciscan missions.\nThe Mission's first permanent Adobe church was dedicated with great ceremony on April 22, 1809. Valuable gifts of vestments, sacred vessels, religious statues, and paintings attest to the generosity of friends of the Mission in the Bay Area and abroad. The majority of vestments in the modern collection date from the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The silken fabrics and embroideries were products of various textile centers of the Spanish Empire, whose suppliers extended from Europe to Asia. Mission San Jos\u00e9 was the center of industry and agriculture. The site was chosen for the abundance of natural resources of the area including water, fertile ground, stones, and adobe soil suitable for building. Thousands of cattle roamed the Mission ranges, and acres of wheat and other crops were planted and harvested under the direction of the Padres. In 1868, it produced 4,070 bushels (110 metric tons) of wheat and much produce, including grapes, olives, and figs.\nIn 1832, the Mission's 12,000 cattle, 13,000 horses, and 12,000 sheep roamed Mission lands from present-day Oakland to San Jose. San Jos\u00e9 was one of the most prosperous of all of the California missions. An 1833 inventory prepared by Father Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio lists a church, monastery, guardhouse, guest house, and a women's dormitory, in addition to the thousands of acres of crops and grazing land. This prosperity was not to last long, however. On August 17 of that year, the Mexican Congress passed \"An Act for the Secularization of the Missions of California\".\nRancho period (1836\u20131853).\nDuring the transition to full secularization, Father Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio remained at the Mission as chief administrator for the church, while Jos\u00e9 de Jes\u00fas Vallejo (brother of General Mariano G. Vallejo) was appointed a civil administrator. The Mission lands were gradually parceled out to private landowners. In 1842, Father Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio was transferred to Mission Santa Barbara. The native people fled but found themselves unable to readjust to their former way of life; many subsequently died of disease and starvation. The Mission buildings, granaries, orchards, and gardens were allowed to decay, and the great herds scattered. Mexican Governor P\u00edo Pico sold the Mission property to private interests in 1845 for $12,000. During the 1848 California Gold Rush, H. C. Smith converted the Mission to a general store, saloon, and hotel. The town of Mission San Jos\u00e9 became a thriving provision center at the gateway to the Southern Mines. The names of many pioneer families prominent in early California history, including Livermore, Peralta, and Alviso, were closely linked to the Mission.\nCalifornia statehood (1850\u20131890).\n The Rancho period ended with the succession of California to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, and the establishment of California as a state in 1850. Some of the original exterior adobe buttresses were removed on orders of the parish priest. On March 18, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln restored the California missions to the Catholic Church.\nOn October 21, 1868, a magnitude 6.3\u20136.7 earthquake on the Hayward Fault which runs through the grounds of the Mission shattered the walls of the Mission church and broke open the roof. Other Mission buildings, including the Tienda, the Priest's Quarters, and the Mission itself were also damaged by the earthquake.\nThe site was cleared and a wood-framed, Gothic-style church was erected directly over the original red-tiled Mission floor. In 1890, a Victorian-style rectory was built over the site of a portion of the adobe wing which housed the Padres and served as the administration building during the Mission Era.\n20th century and beyond (1900\u2013present).\nThe original mission complex consisted of over 100 adobe buildings. Restoration efforts by the Native Sons of the Golden West in 1915 and 1950 saved the surviving portion of the Mission wing and converted it into a museum, set in the gracious surroundings of flowers and palm trees. In 1956, the town of Mission San Jos\u00e9 incorporated with four others to become the City of Fremont. Plans to reconstruct the church of Mission San Jos\u00e9 were launched in 1973. The Victorian-style rectory was relocated to nearby Anza Street and the Gothic-style wooden church was moved to San Mateo where it has been restored as a house of worship by an Anglican church group. After extensive archaeological excavations and planning, construction began in 1982 on a replica of the 1809 adobe church. Work was completed and the facility rededicated on June 11, 1985. The walls vary in thickness from 4 to . Old timbers and rawhide thongs demonstrate the practicality of the Padres who, having no iron nails for building, substituted the leather laces. Consequently, the lumber used in the reconstruction has been given a hand-hewn appearance.\nWith its \"simple and forthright\" exterior, the Mission church stands as a tribute to those whose efforts made this dream come true. The richly decorated interior follows the descriptions in the historic inventories of the 1830s. The crystal chandeliers are copies of period pieces similar to ones listed in the old church inventories. Two of the original statues have been placed on the two side altars. \"Ecce Homo\", a figure of Christ clothed in a scarlet robe and crowned with thorns, stands on a balcony above one of the side altars. The other statue of Saint Bonaventure was carved from wood and then painted. The original baptismal font of hammered copper on a turned wood base has been returned to the church, as has the bell wheel used by the Ohlones during the sacred parts of the Mass.\nThe \"reredos\" behind the main altar features a painting of Christ, a statue of Saint Joseph, and two carved figures: a dove represents the Holy Spirit, and at the top sits God the Father with detailed golden rays surrounding him. The altar and choir railings were copied from an original piece found in the museum during the reconstruction. The Mission cemetery (\"camp Santo\"), where a great number of Mission pioneers are buried, is situated to the side of the church. During the dig, the marble grave marker of Robert Livermore was located in the original tile floor of the church. It was carefully repaired and replaced in the reconstructed church. Many prominent Spaniards are buried in the floor of the Mission church, but only Livermore's grave is marked. Thousands of Ohlones are resting in the Ohlone cemetery located almost a mile away from the mission down Washington Boulevard. Three of the original Mission bells were transferred from the destroyed adobe church to the wooden church of 1869, where they hung until the 1970s. The fourth bell had been given to a church in Oakland and recast, but was returned to the Mission during the reconstruction of the bell tower. Now all four bells are hung, ready to ring on special occasions.\nIn 1985, the restoration of the church was completed by the Committee for the Restoration of the Mission San Jose and the Catholic Diocese of Oakland. It is considered to be a near-perfect replica of the original church, though it incorporates a concealed structural steel frame which provides earthquake resistance. Further reconstruction of the missing part of the Padres' living quarters and a restoration of the surviving adobe wing are part of the overall plans for the Mission. Today, the Mission is administered by St. Joseph's parish, which includes the Mission building and the surrounding areas, an ordinary church building used to fulfill the daily needs of the parish, and a school serving students in grades 1\u20138.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60067", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60067", "title": "Maildir", "text": "E-mail format\nThe Maildir e-mail format is a common way of storing email messages on a file system, rather than in a database. Each message is assigned a file with a unique name, and each mail folder is a file system directory containing these files. Maildir was designed by Daniel J. Bernstein circa 1995, with a major goal of eliminating the need for program code to handle file locking and unlocking through use of the local filesystem. Maildir design reflects the fact that the only operations valid for an email message is that it be created, deleted or have its status changed in some way.\nSpecifications.\nA Maildir directory (often named codice_1) usually has three subdirectories named codice_2, codice_3, and codice_4. \nMaildir++.\nSam Varshavchik, the author of the Courier Mail Server and other software, defined the Maildir++ extension to the Maildir format to support subfolders and mail quotas. Maildir++ directories contain subdirectories with names that start with a '.' (dot) which are also Maildir++ folders. The extension complies with the original Maildir specification, which allows for subdirectories in addition to \"tmp\", \"new\" and \"cur\".\nTechnical operation.\nA mail delivery agent is a program that delivers an email message into a Maildir. The mail delivery agent creates a new file with a unique filename in the codice_2 directory. At the time of its invention guaranteeing unique filenames efficiently was difficult. The original qmail algorithm for unique names was:\nBy 2000, the qmail author recommended in an updated specification to append the value of a per-process counter to the PID, whose value should be incremented after each delivery. The rate-limiting recommendation to \"wait two seconds\" was dropped. \nBy 2003, the recommendations had been further amended to require that instead of the PID and counter, the middle part of the filename should be created by \"concatenating enough of the following strings to guarantee uniqueness\" even in the face of multiple simultaneous deliveries to the same maildir from one or more processes:\nThis 2003 algorithm was criticised in 2006 as being unnecessarily complex by Timo Sirainen, the creator of Dovecot.\nAs of November 2023, qmail author Daniel Bernstein had made no further changes to the 2003 filename generation recommendations. On modern POSIX systems, temporary files can be safely created with the codice_19 C library function.\nThe delivery process stores the message in the maildir by creating and writing to codice_20, and then moving this file to codice_21. The moving can be done using codice_22, which is atomic in many systems. Alternatively, it can be done by hard-linking the file to codice_3 and then unlinking the file from codice_2. Any leftover file will eventually be deleted. This sequence guarantees that a maildir-reading program will not see a partially written message. There can be multiple programs reading a maildir at the same time. They range from mail user agents (MUAs), which access the server's file system directly, through Internet Message Access Protocol or Post Office Protocol servers acting on behalf of remote MUAs, to utilities such as biff and rsync, which may or may not be aware of the maildir structure. Readers should never look in codice_2.\nWhen a cognizant maildir-reading process (either a POP or IMAP server, or a mail user agent acting locally) finds messages in the codice_3 directory, it \"must\" move them to codice_4. It is just a means to notify the user \"you have \"X\" new messages\". This moving needs to be done using the atomic filesystem codice_17, as the alternative \"link-then-unlink\" technique is non-atomic and may result in duplicated messages. An informational suffix is appended to filenames at this stage. It consists of a colon (to separate the unique part of the filename from the actual information), a \"2\", a comma and various flags. The \"2\" specifies the version of the information that follows the comma. \"2\" is the only currently officially specified version, \"1\" being an experimental version. The specification defines flags that show whether the message has been read, deleted and so on: the initial (capital) letter of \"Passed\", \"Replied\", \"Seen\", \"Trashed\", \"Draft\", and \"Flagged\". Applications often choose to supplement this very limited set of flags, for example notmuch offers flag synchronization in addition to arbitrary user-defined flags, while Dovecot uses lowercase letters to match 26 IMAP keywords, which may include keywords such as $MDNSent or user-defined flags.\nAlthough Maildir was intended to allow lockless usage, in practice some software that uses Maildirs also uses locks, such as Dovecot.\nFile-system compatibility issues.\nThe Maildir standard can only be implemented on systems that accept colons in filenames. \nSystems that don't allow colons in filenames (this includes Microsoft Windows and some configurations of Novell Storage Services) can use a non-standard alternative separator, such as \";\" or \"-\". It is often trivial to patch free and open-source software to use a different separator.\nAs there is currently no agreement on what character this alternative separator should be, there can be interoperability difficulties between different Maildir-supporting programs on these systems. However, not all Maildir-related software needs to know what the separator character is, because not all Maildir-related software needs to be able to read or modify the flags of a message (\"read\", \"replied to\" etc.); software that merely delivers to a Maildir or archives old messages from it based only on date, should work no matter what separator is in use. If only the MUA needs to read or modify message flags, and only one MUA is used, then non-standard alternative separators may be used without interoperability problems.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded on June 24, 1797, by Ferm\u00edn de Lasu\u00e9n of the Franciscan order, the mission was the fifteenth of the Spanish missions established in present-day California. Named for Saint John the Baptist, the mission is the namesake of the city of San Juan Bautista.\nBarracks for the soldiers, a nunnery, the Jose Castro House, the Plaza Hotel and other buildings were constructed around a large grassy plaza in front of the church and can be seen today in their original form. The Ohlone, the original residents of the valley, were brought to live at the mission and baptized, followed by Yokuts from the Central Valley. Mission San Juan Bautista has served mass daily since 1797, and today functions as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey.\nHistory.\nFollowing its creation in 1797, San Juan's population grew quickly. By 1803, there were 1,036 Native Americans living at the mission. Ranching and farming activity had moved apace, with 1,036 cattle, 4,600 sheep, 22 swine, 540 horses and 8 mules counted that year. At the same time, the harvest of wheat, barley and corn was estimated at 2,018 fanegas, each of about 220 pounds.\nFather Pedro Est\u00e9van T\u00e1pis (who had a special talent for music) joined Father Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta, at Mission San Juan Bautista in 1815 to teach singing to the Native Americans. He employed a system of notation developed in Spain that uses varied colors or textures for polyphonic music, usually (from bottom to top) solid black, solid red, black outline (sometimes solid yellow) and red outline (or black outline when yellow was used). His choir of Native American boys performed for many visitors, earning the San Juan Bautista Mission the nickname \"the Mission of Music.\" Two of his handwritten choir books are preserved at the San Juan Bautista Museum. When Father Tapis died in 1825 he was buried on the mission grounds. The town of San Juan Bautista, which grew up around the mission, expanded rapidly during the California Gold Rush and continues to be a thriving community today.\nThe mission is situated adjacent to the San Andreas Fault, and has suffered damage from numerous earthquakes, such as those of 1800 and 1906. However, the mission was never entirely destroyed at once. It was restored initially in 1884, and then again in 1949 with funding from the Hearst Foundation. The three-bell \"campanario\", or \"bell wall,\" located by the church entrance, was fully restored in 2010. An unpaved stretch of the original El Camino Real, just east of the mission, lies on a fault scarp.\nAlthough initially secularized in 1835, the church was reconsecrated by the Catholic Church in 1859, and continues to serve as a parish of the Diocese of Monterey. The mission includes a cemetery, with the remains of over 4,000 Native American converts and Europeans buried there.\nThe mission and its grounds were featured prominently in the 1958 Alfred Hitchcock film \"Vertigo\". Associate producer Herbert Coleman's daughter Judy Lanini suggested the mission to Hitchcock as a filming location. A steeple, added sometime after the mission's original construction and secularization, had been demolished following a fire, so Hitchcock added a bell tower using scale models, matte paintings, and trick photography at the Paramount studio in Los Angeles. The tower does not resemble the original steeple. The tower's staircase was assembled inside a studio.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She is noted for her innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, as well as elaborate stage shows. Her sound and choreography became a catalyst in the growth of MTV, enabling her to rise to prominence while breaking gender and racial barriers in the process. Lyrical content that focused on social issues and lived experiences set her reputation as a role model for youth.\nThe tenth and youngest child of the Jackson family, Jackson starred in multiple television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including \"Good Times\", \"Diff'rent Strokes\" and \"Fame\". She signed a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1982 and became a pop icon following the releases of the albums \"Control\" (1986) and \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" (1989). Her collaborations with record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis incorporated a variety of music genres, which led to crossover success in popular music and influenced the development of the new jack swing fusion genre. In the 1990s, Jackson became one of the highest-paid artists in the industry, signing two record-breaking multimillion-dollar contracts with Virgin Records. She established her image as a sex symbol with a leading role in the film \"Poetic Justice\" (1993), and the albums \"Janet\" (1993) and \"The Velvet Rope\" (1997). \"Billboard\" named her the second most successful artist of the decade in the United States.\nThe release of her seventh studio album \"All for You\" in 2001 coincided with Jackson being the subject of the first \"MTV Icon\" special. By the end of the year, she joined her brother Michael as one of the few artists to score ten number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. However, the backlash from the 2004 Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy resulted in an industry blacklisting under the direction of Les Moonves, then-CEO of CBS. Jackson subsequently experienced reduced radio airplay, televised promotion and sales figures from that point forward. After parting ways with Virgin Records, she released her tenth studio album \"Discipline\" (2008), her only album with Island Records. In 2015, she partnered with BMG Rights Management to launch her own record label, Rhythm Nation, as well as to release her eleventh studio album \"Unbreakable\" (2015). Jackson has continued to release music and perform, with the (2023\u20132024) becoming the highest-grossing tour of her career.\nJackson has sold over 100 million records, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists. She holds the record for the most consecutive top-ten entries on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 by a female artist (18) and remains the only artist in the history of the chart to have seven singles from one album (\"Rhythm Nation 1814\") peak within the top five positions. In 2008, \"Billboard\" placed her number seven on its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, and in 2010 ranked her fifth among the \"Top 50 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\". In 2016, the magazine named her the second most successful dance club artist. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, eleven \"Billboard\" Music Awards, eleven American Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and eight \"Guinness World Records\" entries. In 2019, she was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nLife and career.\n1966\u20131985: Early life and career beginnings.\nJanet Damita Jo Jackson was born on May 16, 1966, in Gary, Indiana. She was the youngest of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. Her mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (\"n\u00e9e\" Scruse), played clarinet, cello, and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. Her father, Joseph Walter \"Joe\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. Janet's great-great-grandfather, July \"Jack\" Gale, was a US Army scout. Family lore held that he was also a Native American medicine man. Janet grew up with two sisters (Rebbie and La Toya) and six brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, Michael and Randy). Another brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth. The Jacksons were devout Jehovah's Witnesses, although Janet would later refrain from organized religion.\nAt a young age, Jackson's brothers began performing as the Jackson 5 in the Chicago-Gary area. In March 1969, they signed a record deal with Motown, and soon had their first number-one hit. The family then moved to the Encino neighborhood of Los Angeles. Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer, with plans to support herself through acting. Despite this, she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio.\nAt age seven, Jackson and her sisters performed with the Jackson 5 for their revue at the MGM Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. A biography revealed her father, Joseph, was emotionally withdrawn and told her to address him solely by his first name as a child. She began acting in the variety show \"The Jacksons\" in 1976.\nIn 1977, she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom \"Good Times\". She later starred in \"A New Kind of Family\" and later got a recurring role on \"Diff'rent Strokes\", portraying Charlene Duprey from seasons three to six. Jackson also played the role of Cleo Hewitt during the fourth season of \"Fame\", but expressed indifference towards the series, largely due to the emotional stress of her secret marriage to R&amp;B singer James DeBarge. Jackson later elaborated on her time on the show in an interview with Anderson Cooper, revealing that the cast would occasionally play pranks on her, but she spoke fondly of them.\nWhen Jackson was fifteen, her father and manager Joseph Jackson arranged a contract for her with A&amp;M Records. Her debut album, \"Janet Jackson\", was released in 1982. It was produced by Angela Winbush, Ren\u00e9 Moore, Bobby Watson of Rufus and Leon Sylvers III, and overseen by her father Joseph. It peaked at No. 63 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and No. 6 on the publication's R&amp;B albums chart, receiving little promotion. The album appeared on the \"Billboard\" Top Black Albums of 1983, while Jackson herself was the highest-ranking female vocalist on the \"Billboard\" Year-End Black Album Artists.\nJackson's second album, \"Dream Street\", was released two years later. \"Dream Street\" reached No. 147 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and No. 19 on the R&amp;B albums chart. The lead single \"Don't Stand Another Chance\" peaked at No. 9 on \"Billboard\"'s R&amp;B singles chart. Both albums consisted primarily of bubblegum pop music.\n1986\u20131988: \"Control\".\nAfter her second album, Jackson terminated business affairs with her family, commenting \"I just wanted to get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do.\" Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, \"Control\", released in February 1986. The album shot to No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200, and was certified fivefold Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.\n\"Control\" was declared \"remarkably nervy and mature\" for a teenage act, also considered \"an alternative to the sentimental balladry\" which permeated radio, likening Jackson to Donna Summer's position of \"unwilling to accept novelty status and taking her own steps to rise above it.\" The album spawned five top five singles, \"What Have You Done for Me Lately\", \"Nasty\", \"When I Think of You\", \"Control\", and \"Let's Wait Awhile\", and a top 15 hit with \"The Pleasure Principle\". \"When I Think of You\" became her first No. 1 hit on the Hot 100. \"Control\" received six \"Billboard\" Awards, including \"Top Pop Singles Artist\", and three Grammy nominations, such as Album of the Year. It also won three American Music Awards from twelve nominations.\nAt this point, Jackson was successfully \"shaking off the experience of being a shadow Jackson child\", becoming \"an artist in her own right\". The album's lyrical content included several themes of empowerment, inspired by an incident of sexual harassment, with Jackson recalling \"the danger hit home when a couple of guys started stalking me on the street and instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. I backed them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense.\"\nIts innovative fusion of dance-pop and industrial music with hip-hop and R&amp;B undertones influenced the development of the new jack swing genre by bridging the gap between the latter two styles. The accompanying music videos shot for the album's singles became popular on MTV, and obtained a then-unknown Paula Abdul a recording contract for her choreography work with Jackson. \"Billboard\" stated \"[Jackson's] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix.\"\nIn retrospect of her influence on the channel, Kyle Anderson of \"Entertainment Weekly\" commented: \"The videos from Control were all over MTV, and Janet established herself as an instantly dominant pop figure talked about in the same sentences as Madonna and her older brother Michael.\" MTV's Meaghan Garvey asserted \"it's hard to overstate the significance of Control, whether in terms of the pop landscape, the evolution of the music video as a vessel for promotion and expression, or Top 40 feminist anthems.\" She also argued \"it's important to note that \"Control\"'s self-actualization anthems were expressions of black female pride. \"Control\" spawned a whopping six videos\u2014great ones, at that\u2014which played an immeasurable role in the shift toward visible black pop.\"\n1989\u20131992: \"Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814\".\nJackson released her fourth album, \"Rhythm Nation 1814\", in September 1989. Although her record label desired a direct sequel to \"Control\", Jackson chose to include a socially conscious theme among various musical styles. She stated, \"I know an album or a song can't change the world. I just want my music and my dance to catch the audience's attention, and to hold it long enough for them to listen to the lyrics.\" The album's central theme of unity was developed in response to various crimes and tragedies reported in the media.\nPeaking at No. 1 on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200, the album was certified sixfold Platinum by the RIAA and sold over 12 million copies worldwide. \"Rolling Stone\" observed Jackson's artistic growth shifted from \"personal freedom to more universal concerns\u2014injustice, illiteracy, crime, drugs\u2014without missing a beat.\" The album was also considered \"the exclamation point on her career\", consisting of a \"diverse collection of songs flowing with the natural talent Jackson possesses\", which effectively \"expanded Janet's range in every conceivable direction\", being \"more credibly feminine, more crucially masculine, more viably adult, more believably childlike.\" With singles \"Miss You Much\", \"Rhythm Nation\", \"Escapade\", \"Alright\", \"Come Back to Me\", \"Black Cat\" and \"Love Will Never Do (Without You)\", it became the first album in history to produce number one hits in three separate calendar years, as well as the only album to achieve seven top five singles on the Hot 100.\nFamous for its choreography and warehouse setting, the \"Rhythm Nation\" music video is considered one of the most iconic and popular in history, with Jackson's military ensemble also making her a fashion icon. The video for \"Love Will Never Do (Without You)\" is notable for being the first instance of Jackson's transition into sexual imagery and midriff-baring style, becoming her trademark. \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" became the highest selling album of 1990, winning a record fifteen \"Billboard\" Awards. The full \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" short film won a Grammy Award.\nJackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 became the most successful debut tour in history and set a record for the fastest sell-out of Japan's Tokyo Dome. She established the \"Rhythm Nation Scholarship\", donating funds from the tour to various educational programs. As Jackson began her tour, she was acknowledged for the cultural impact of her music. Joel Selvin of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" wrote \"the 23-year-old has been making smash hit records for four years, becoming a fixture on MTV and a major role model to teenage girls across the country\", and William Allen, then-executive vice president of the United Negro College Fund, told the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Jackson is a role model for all young people to emulate and the message she has gotten to the young people of this country through the lyrics of 'Rhythm Nation 1814' is having positive effects.\"\nShe also received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in recognition of her impact on the recording industry and philanthropic endeavors. The massive success experienced by Jackson placed her in league with her brother Michael, Madonna, and Tina Turner for her achievements and influence. \"Ebony\" magazine remarked: \"No individual or group has impacted the world of entertainment as have Michael and Janet Jackson,\" arguing that despite many imitators, few could surpass Jackson's \"stunning style and dexterity\".\nWith her recording contract under A&amp;M Records fulfilled in 1991, she signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Virgin Records\u2014estimated between thirty-two to fifty million dollars\u2014making her the highest paid recording artist at the time. The recording contract also established her reputation as the \"Queen of Pop\". In 1992, Jackson provided guest vocals on Luther Vandross's \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\", becoming a top ten \"Billboard\" hit and reaching the top ten internationally.\n1993\u20131996: \"Janet\", \"Poetic Justice\", and \"Design of a Decade\".\nJackson's fifth studio album, \"Janet\", was released in May 1993. The record opened at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200, making Jackson the first female artist in the Nielsen SoundScan era to do so. Certified sixfold Platinum by the RIAA, it sold over 14 million copies worldwide.\n\"Janet\" spawned five singles and four promotional singles, receiving various certifications worldwide. The lead single \"That's the Way Love Goes\" won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song and topped the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. \"Again\" reached number one for two weeks, while \"If\" and \"Any Time, Any Place\" peaked in the top four. \"Because of Love\" and \"You Want This\" charted within the top ten.\nThe album experimented with a diverse number of genres, including contemporary R&amp;B, deep house, swing jazz, hip-hop, rock, and pop, with \"Billboard\" describing each as being \"delivered with consummate skill and passion\". Jackson took a larger role in songwriting and production than she did on her previous albums, explaining she found it necessary \"to write all the lyrics and half of the melodies\" while also speaking candidly about incorporating her sexuality into the album's content. \"Rolling Stone\" wrote \"[a]s princess of America's black royal family, everything Janet Jackson does is important. Whether proclaiming herself in charge of her life, as she did on \"Control\" (1986), or commander in chief of a rhythm army dancing to fight society's problems (\"Rhythm Nation 1814\", from 1989), she's influential. And when she announces her sexual maturity, as she does on her new album, \"Janet.\", it's a cultural moment.\"\nIn July 1993, Jackson made her film debut in \"Poetic Justice\". While the film received mixed reviews, her performance was described as \"beguiling\" and \"believably eccentric\". Jackson's ballad \"Again\", which was written for the film, received Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for \"Best Original Song\".\nIn September 1993, Jackson appeared topless on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\", with her breasts covered anonymously by her then-husband, Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr. The photograph is the original version of the cropped image used on the \"Janet\" album cover, shot by Patrick Demarchelier. \"The Vancouver Sun\" reported, \"Jackson, 27, remains clearly established as both role model and sex symbol; the \"Rolling Stone\" photo of Jackson\u00a0... became one of the most recognizable, and most lampooned, magazine covers.\"\nThe Janet World Tour launched in support of the studio album garnered criticism for Jackson's lack of vocal proficiency and spontaneity, but earned critical acclaim for her showmanship. It was described as erasing the line between \"stadium-size pop music concerts and full-scale theatrical extravaganzas\".\nDuring this time, Janet was set to sign a multimillion-dollar deal with Coca-Cola when her brother Michael was immersed in a child sex abuse scandal, of which he denied any wrongdoing. She provided moral support, defending her brother, and denied abuse allegations regarding her parents made by her sister La Toya.\nShe collaborated with Michael on \"Scream\", the lead single from his album \"\", released in 1995. The song was written by both siblings as a response to media scrutiny. It debuted at number five on the Hot\u00a0100 singles chart, becoming the first song ever to debut within the top five. Its music video, directed by Mark Romanek, was listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the \"Most Expensive Music Video Ever Made\", costing $7 million. The clip won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video.\nJackson's first compilation album, \"\", was released in 1995. It peaked at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200. The lead single, \"Runaway\", became the first song by a female artist to debut within the top ten of the Hot\u00a0100, reaching number three. \"Design of a Decade 1986\u20131996\" was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.\nJackson's influence in pop music continued to garner acclaim, as \"The Boston Globe\" remarked \"If you're talking about the female power elite in pop, you can't get much higher than Janet Jackson, Bonnie Raitt, Madonna and Yoko Ono. Their collective influence\u00a0... is beyond measure. And who could dispute that Janet Jackson now has more credibility than brother Michael?\"\nJackson renewed her contract with Virgin Records for a reported $80 million the following year. The contract established her as the then highest-paid recording artist in history, surpassing the recording industry's then-unparalleled $60 million contracts earned by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n1997\u20131999: \"The Velvet Rope\".\nJackson began suffering from severe depression and anxiety, leading her to chronicle the experience in her sixth album, \"The Velvet Rope,\" released October 1997. Jackson returned with a dramatic change in image, boasting vibrant red hair, nasal piercings, and tattoos. The album is primarily centered on the idea that everyone has an intrinsic need to belong. Aside from encompassing lyrics relating to social issues such as same-sex relationships, homophobia and domestic violence, it also contains themes of sadomasochism and is considered far more sexually explicit in nature than her previous release, \"Janet\".\nThe record was hailed as \"her most daring, elaborate and accomplished album\" by \"The New York Times\", while \"Billboard\" called it \"the best American album of the year and the most empowering of her last five.\" The album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 and was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA. It has sold over eight million copies worldwide.\nThe lead single \"Got 'til It's Gone\" was released in September 1997, featuring guest vocals from folk singer Joni Mitchell and rapper Q-Tip. The song's music video, depicting a pre-Apartheid celebration, won the Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video. \"Together Again\" became Jackson's eighth number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot\u00a0100, placing her on par with Elton John, Diana Ross, and the Rolling Stones. It spent a record forty-six weeks on the Hot\u00a0100 and nineteen weeks on the United Kingdom's singles chart. It sold six million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling singles of all time. \"I Get Lonely\" peaked at number three on the Hot\u00a0100, and received a Grammy nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance. It was Jackson's eighteenth consecutive top ten hit, making her the only female artist to garner that achievement; and surpassed only by Elvis Presley and the Beatles.\nSeveral other singles were released, including \"Go Deep\" and the ballad \"Every Time\", which was controversial for the nudity displayed in its music video. The album fully established Jackson as a gay icon for its themes regarding homosexuality and protesting homophobia. \"Together Again\", a \"post-Aids pop song\", and \"Free Xone\", considered \"a paean to homosexuality\" and an \"anti-homophobia track\", were praised for their lyrical context, in addition to Jackson's lesbian reinterpretation of Rod Stewart's \"Tonight's the Night\".\n\"The Velvet Rope\" received an award for \"Outstanding Music Album\" at the 9th Annual GLAAD Media Awards and was honored by the National Black Lesbian and Gay Leadership Forum. A portion of the proceeds from \"Together Again\" were donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research.\nJackson embarked on The Velvet Rope Tour, traveling to Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. The tour received praise for its theatrics, choreography, and Jackson's vocal performance. It was likened to \"the ambition and glamour of a Broadway musical\", and exclaimed as \"only fitting that the concert program credits her as the show's 'creator and director'\".\nThe tour's HBO special, \"The Velvet Rope: Live in Madison Square Garden\", garnered more than fifteen million viewers. It surpassed the ratings of all four major networks among viewers subscribed to the channel. The concert won an Emmy Award from four nominations. Jackson donated a portion of the tour's sales to America's Promise, an organization founded by Colin Powell to assist disenfranchised youth.\nAs the tour concluded, Jackson lent guest vocals to several collaborations, including Shaggy's \"Luv Me, Luv Me\", used for the film \"How Stella Got Her Groove Back\", as well as \"Girlfriend/Boyfriend\" with Teddy Riley's group Blackstreet, and \"What's It Gonna Be?!\" with Busta Rhymes. The latter two music videos are both among the most expensive music videos ever produced, with \"What's It Gonna Be?!\" becoming a number-one hit on the \"Billboard\" Hip-Hop Singles and Hot Rap Tracks charts, reaching the top three of the Hot 100.\nJackson also contributed the ballad \"God's Stepchild\" to the \"Down in the Delta\" soundtrack. Jackson recorded a duet with Elton John titled \"I Know the Truth\", included on the soundtrack to \"Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida\". At the 1999 World Music Awards, Jackson received the Legend Award for \"outstanding contribution to the pop industry\". \"Billboard\" ranked Jackson as the second most successful artist of the decade, behind Mariah Carey.\n2000\u20132003: \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" and \"All for You\".\nIn July 2000, Jackson appeared in her second film, \"\", in the role of Professor Denise Gaines, opposite Eddie Murphy. Director Peter Segal stated \"Janet Jackson was a natural fit, and an obvious choice.\" The film became her second to open at number one, grossing an estimated $170 million worldwide. Jackson's single \"Doesn't Really Matter\", used for the film's soundtrack, became her ninth number-one single on the Hot 100.\nPreceding the release of her seventh album, MTV honored Jackson with the network's inaugural \"MTV Icon\" ceremony, honoring her \"significant contributions to music, music video and pop culture while tremendously impacting the MTV Generation.\" The event paid tribute to Jackson's career and influence, including commentary from Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez, Aaliyah, and Jessica Simpson, and performances by 'N Sync, Pink, Destiny's Child, Usher, Buckcherry, M\u00fda, Macy Gray, and Outkast. The American Music Awards also honored Jackson with the Award of Merit for \"her finely crafted, critically acclaimed and socially conscious, multi-platinum albums\".\nJackson's seventh album, \"All for You\", was released in April 2001. It opened at number one on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200 with 605,000 copies sold, the highest first-week sales of her career, and among the highest first-week sales by a female artist in history. The album was a return to an upbeat dance style, receiving generally positive reception. Jackson received praise for indulging in \"textures as dizzying as a new infatuation\", in contrast to other artists attempting to \"match the angularity of hip-hop\" and following trends. \"All for You\" was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.\nThe album's lead single, \"All for You\", debuted on the Hot 100 at number fourteen, setting a record for the highest debut by a single that was not commercially available. Jackson was titled \"Queen\u00a0of\u00a0Radio\" by MTV as the single made airplay history, being \"added to every pop, rhythmic and urban radio station\" within its first week. The song broke the overall airplay debut record with a first week audience of seventy million, debuting at number nine on the Radio Songs chart. It topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks, also reaching the top ten in eleven countries. The song received a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. \"Someone to Call My Lover\" peaked at number three on the Hot\u00a0100.\nIn July 2001, Jackson embarked on the All for You Tour, which was also broadcast on a concert special for HBO watched by twelve million viewers. The tour traveled throughout the United States and Japan, although European and Asian dates were required to be canceled following the September 11 terrorist attacks. The \"Los Angeles Times\" complimented Jackson's showmanship. Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" said Jackson's performance surpassed her contemporaries, but Bob Massy of \"Spin\" thought her dancers \"threw crisper moves\" and her supporting singers were mixed nearly as high, though declared \"Janet cast herself as the real entertainment.\" Jackson donated a portion of the tour's proceeds to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.\nThe following year, Jackson began receiving media attention for her rumored relationships with Justin Timberlake, actor Matthew McConaughey, and record producer Jermaine Dupri.\n2004\u20132005: Super Bowl XXXVIII controversy and \"Damita Jo\".\nJackson was chosen by the National Football League and MTV to perform at the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show in February 2004. She performed a medley of \"All for You\", \"Rhythm Nation\", and an excerpt of \"The Knowledge\" before performing \"Rock Your Body\" alongside surprise guest Justin Timberlake. As Timberlake sang the lyric \"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song\", he tore open her costume, exposing her right breast to 140 million viewers. The incident was referred to as \"nipple gate\" by the media.\nJackson issued an apology after the performance, saying that the incident was accidental and unintended, explaining that Timberlake was only meant to pull away a bustier and leave the red-lace bra intact. She commented, \"I am really sorry if I offended anyone. That was truly not my intention\u00a0... MTV, CBS, the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever, and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end.\" Timberlake also issued an apology, calling the accident a \"wardrobe malfunction\". CBS, the NFL, and MTV denied any knowledge of the incident and all responsibility for it. The Federal Communications Commission heavily fined all companies involved and continued an investigation for eight years, ultimately losing its appeal for a $550,000 fine against CBS.\nFollowing the incident, CBS permitted Timberlake to appear at the 46th Grammy Awards ceremony but did not allow Jackson to attend, forcing her to withdraw after being scheduled as a presenter. The controversy halted plans for Jackson to star in the biographical film of singer and activist Lena Horne, which was to be produced by ABC. Horne was reportedly displeased by the incident, but Jackson's representatives stated that she withdrew from the project willingly. A Mickey Mouse statue wearing Jackson's iconic \"Rhythm Nation\" outfit was mantled at Walt Disney World theme park the previous year to honor her legacy, but it was removed following her controversial performance.\nJackson's eighth studio album \"Damita Jo\" was released in March 2004, titled after her middle name. It debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album received mixed to positive reviews, praising the sonic innovation of selected songs and Jackson's vocal harmonies, while others criticized its frequent themes of carnality. However, several critics' reviews focused on the Super Bowl incident, rather than critiquing the album itself. It was certified Platinum by the RIAA within a month, and sold over three million copies worldwide.\nThe album's performance was affected by blacklisting from radio and music channels, in part at the behest of CBS CEO Les Moonves. Conglomerates involved in the boycott included Viacom and CBS, subsidiaries MTV, Clear Channel Communications, and Infinity Broadcasting, the latter two among the largest radio broadcasters. The blacklist was placed into effect preceding the release of \"Damita Jo\" and continued throughout the course of Jackson's following two albums. Entertainment conglomerate Viacom owns MTV, VH1, and many radio formats, and a senior executive commented that they were \"absolutely bailing on the record. The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure.\"\nPrior to the incident, \"Damita Jo\" was expected to outsell prior release \"All for You\". Its three singles received positive reviews but failed to achieve high chart positions, although each was predicted to perform extremely well under different circumstances. \"Billboard\" reported that \"Damita Jo\" \"was largely overshadowed by the Super Bowl fiasco... The three singles it spawned were blacklisted by pop radio\u2014they were also the album's biggest highlights\".\nFor the album's promotion, Jackson appeared as a host on \"Saturday Night Live\" performing two songs, and she was also a guest star on the sitcom \"Will &amp; Grace\" portraying herself. Jackson received several career accolades upon the album's release, including the \"Legend Award\" at the Radio Music Awards, \"Inspiration Award\" from the Japan Video Music Awards, \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" at the Soul Train Music Awards, and a Teen Choice Awards nomination for \"Favorite Female\".\nIn November 2004, she was honored as a role model by 100 Black Men of America, Inc. and presented with the organization's Artistic Achievement Award saluting \"a career that has gone from success to greater success\". The organization responded to criticism for honoring Jackson in light of the Super Bowl incident by saying that \"an individual's worth can't be judged by a single moment in that person's life.\" In June 2005, she was honored with a Humanitarian Award by the Human Rights Campaign and AIDS Project Los Angeles as recognition for her involvement in raising money for AIDS charities.\nImpact on the Internet.\nThe Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show is considered to be one of the most controversial televised events in history, and Jackson was later listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\". The incident became the most recorded and replayed moment in TiVo history, enticing an estimated 35,000 new subscribers. Jawed Karim has stated that the incident inspired the creation of YouTube, as he noted that it was difficult for him to find videos of the incident online.\n2006\u20132007: \"20 Y.O.\" and \"Why Did I Get Married?\".\nJackson began recording her ninth studio album, \"20 Y.O.\", in 2005. She recorded with producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album's title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album \"Control\", representing the album's \"celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style\".\nTo promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the \"Today Show\" and at the Billboard Awards. Jackson's \"Us Weekly\" cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. \"20 Y.O.\" was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\"\u00a0200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. \"Rolling Stone\" disagreed with the album's reference to \"Control\", saying \"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\"\nJackson's airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single \"Call on Me\", which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album's second single, \"So Excited\", was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine.\n\"20 Y.O.\" was certified Platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.5 million copies worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&amp;B Album.\nAfter the album's release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. \"Slant Magazine\" stated, \"After promising a return to Janet's dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.\"\nJackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by \"Forbes\", having amassed a fortune of over $150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film \"Why Did I Get Married?\". It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing $60 million. Jackson's performance was praised for its \"soft authority\", though also described as \"charming, yet bland\".\n2008\u20132009: \"Discipline\" and \"Number Ones\".\nJackson signed with Island Records after her contract with Virgin was fulfilled. She interrupted plans for touring and began recording with various producers, including Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, Tricky Stewart, and Stargate. Her tenth studio album, \"Discipline\", was released in February 2008, opening at number one. Despite radio blacklisting, the album's first single \"Feedback\" peaked at number nineteen on the Hot\u00a0100 and nine on Pop Songs, her highest-charting single since \"Someone to Call My Lover\".\nAlso in February 2008, Jackson won an Image Award for \"Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture\" for the role. Jackson was also approached to record the lead single for the film \"Rush Hour 3\". Jackson was awarded the Vanguard Award at the 19th annual GLAAD Media Awards, honoring her contributions in promoting equal rights among the gay community. The organization's president commented, \"Ms. Jackson has a tremendous following inside the LGBT community and out, and having her stand with us against the defamation that LGBT people still face in our country is extremely significant.\"\nJackson's fifth concert tour, the Rock Witchu Tour, began in September 2008. Jackson parted with Island Records through mutual agreement. \"Billboard\" disclosed Jackson was dissatisfied with L.A. Reid's handling of the album and its promotion, saying \"the label agreed to dissolve their relationship with the artist at her request.\" Producer Rodney Jerkins expressed \"I felt like it wasn't pushed correctly... She just didn't get her just due as an artist of that magnitude.\"\nIn June 2009, Jackson's brother Michael died at age fifty. She spoke publicly concerning his death at the 2009 BET Awards, stating \"I'd just like to say, to you, Michael is an icon, to us, Michael is family. And he will forever live in all of our hearts. On behalf of my family and myself, thank you for all of your love, thank you for all of your support. We miss him so much.\" In an interview, she revealed she had first learned of his death while filming \"Why Did I Get Married Too?\".\nAmidst mourning with her family, she focused on work to deal with the grief, avoiding any news coverage of her sibling's death. She commented, \"it's still important to face reality, and not that I'm running, but sometimes you just need to get away for a second.\" During this time, she ended her seven-year relationship with Jermaine Dupri.\nSeveral months later, Jackson performed a tribute to Michael at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, performing their duet \"Scream\". MTV stated \"there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message.\" The performance was lauded by critics, with \"Entertainment Weekly\" affirming the rendition \"as energetic as it was heartfelt\".\nJackson's second hits compilation, \"Number Ones\" (retitled \"The Best\" for international releases), was released in November 2009. For promotion, she performed a medley of hits at the American Music Awards, Capital FM's Jingle Bell Ball at London's O2 arena, and \"The X-Factor\". The album's promotional single \"Make Me\", produced with Rodney \"Darkchild\" Jerkins, debuted in September. It became Jackson's nineteenth number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, making her the first artist to have number-one singles in four separate decades.\nLater that month, Jackson chaired the inaugural benefit of amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, held in Milan in conjunction with fashion week. The foundation's CEO stated \"We are profoundly grateful to Janet Jackson for joining amfAR as a chair of its first event in Milan... She brings incomparable grace and a history of dedication to the fight against AIDS.\" The event raised $1.1 million for the nonprofit organization.\n2010\u20132014: Film projects and \"True You\".\nIn April 2010, Jackson reprised her role in the sequel to \"Why Did I Get Married?\" titled \"Why Did I Get Married Too?\". The film opened at number two, grossing sixty million. Jackson's performance was hailed as \"invigorating and oddly funny\", and praised for her \"willingness to be seen at her most disheveled\". Her performance earned her an Image Award for \"Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture\". Jackson recorded the film's theme, \"Nothing\", released as a promotional single. The song was performed on the ninth season finale of \"American Idol\" along with \"Again\" and \"Nasty\".\nIn July, Jackson modeled for the Blackglama clothing line featuring mink fur, then helped design a signature line of clothing and accessories for Blackglama, to be sold at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales. Universal Music released the hits compilation \"\" as the debut of the \"Icon\" compilation series.\nIn November 2010, Jackson starred as Joanna in the drama \"For Colored Girls\", the film adaptation of Ntozake Shange's 1975 play \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" stated Jackson \"recites verses written by Ntozake Shange, the author of the play that inspired the film\u00a0... But instead of offering up a mannered coffeehouse reading of the lines, Jackson makes the words sound like ordinary\u2014though very eloquent\u2014speech.\" Jackson's portrayal in the film was likened to Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly in \"The Devil Wears Prada\". Her performance earned Black Reel Awards nominations in the categories of Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Ensemble.\nIn support of her second hits collection, \"Number Ones\", Jackson embarked on her largest world tour, entitled Number Ones, Up Close and Personal; she held concerts in thirty-five global cities, selected by fans who submitted suggestions on her official website.

Mattel released a limited-edition Barbie of Jackson titled \"Divinely Janet\", auctioned for over $15,000, with proceeds donated to Project Angel Food.\nJackson released the self-help book \"\" in February 2011, co-written with David Ritz. It chronicled her struggle with weight and confidence, also publishing letters from fans. It topped \"The New York Times'\" Best Seller list the following month. Additionally, she signed a film production contract with Lions Gate Entertainment to \"select, develop and produce a feature film for the independent studio.\"\nJackson became the first female pop singer to perform at the I. M. Pei glass pyramid at the Louvre Museum, raising contributions for the restoration of iconic artwork. Jackson was selected to endorse fashion line \"Blackglama\" for a second year, being the first celebrity in the line's history chosen to do so.

On August 20, she released a preview of a new song \"The Great Forever\" followed by the launch of her Unbreakable World Tour on August 31.\nThe upcoming album's title track \"Unbreakable\" was released on September 11, 2015. \"Burnitup!\" featuring Missy Elliott debuted on BBC Radio 1 on September 24, 2015.\nThe \"Unbreakable\" album was released on October 2, 2015. It received largely positive reviews, including those by \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", \"USA Today\", \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Guardian\". The following week, Jackson received her first nomination to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Her album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, becoming her seventh album to top the chart in the United States. Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis stated that Jackson's concept for the album was developed simultaneously with the accompanying tour's production and that its composition differed from the majority of her catalog. They also stated that the album's theme reflects \"being able to be vulnerable and to be able to withstand what comes to you,\" drawing on Jackson's experiences over the past several years.\nOn April 6, 2016, Jackson postponed her tour in favour of \"planning her family\" with husband Wissam Al Mana. On September 7, 2017, Jackson resumed her Unbreakable World Tour, now known as the State of the World Tour. Refocusing the tour's theme to reflect socially conscious messages from Jackson's entire music catalog, many songs selected for the concert set list along with corresponding imagery depicted on stage address racism, white supremacy, fascism, xenophobia and police brutality. The tour opened to positive critical reception, with several commentators praising Jackson's post-pregnancy physical fitness, showmanship and socially conscious messages.\nHer emotional rendition of \"What About\", a song about domestic violence originally recorded for \"The Velvet Rope\", drew media attention highlighting her recent separation from her husband; Jackson's brother Randy alleges she suffered verbal abuse by Al Mana which contributed to the breakdown of their marriage. Proceeds from the concert of September 9, 2017, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas were donated to relief efforts supporting evacuees of Hurricane Harvey. Jackson met with Houston mayor Sylvester Turner and evacuees at the George R. Brown Convention Center prior to the performance. Jackson received the Billboard Icon Award at the 2018 \"Billboard\" Music Awards. In an interview for \"Billboard\" magazine, Jackson revealed that she was then working on new music. On August 16, 2018, Jackson and Rhythm Nation entered into a partnership with Cinq Music Group. The next day, Jackson released the single \"Made for Now\", a collaboration with Daddy Yankee.\nIn October 2018, she received her third nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2019, Jackson was inducted into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nOn May 17, 2019, Jackson launched a four-month Las Vegas residency entitled \"\". The initial schedule comprised fourteen shows at the Park Theater at Park MGM resort; three additional shows were added in May. In September and November 2019 Jackson performed a series of concerts in support of the 30th anniversary of the \"Rhythm Nation\" album in Welch Treasure Island Resort &amp; Casino, San Francisco and Hawaii. In 2019, Jackson played a variety of festivals in the US and abroad, including The Glastonbury Festival.\n2020\u2013present: Documentaries and Together Again Tour.\nJackson was set to embark on the Black Diamond World Tour in 2020 in support of her twelfth studio album \"Black Diamond\", which was scheduled for a release that year. However, the tour was postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nA two-part documentary titled \"Janet Jackson\" for Lifetime and A&amp;E premiered on January 28 and 29, 2022, respectively. Jackson previewed a clip of a new song, \"Luv I Luv\", during the end credits of the last episode of her documentary. Jackson was a headliner of the 2022 Essence Music Festival in New Orleans.\nOn April 14, 2023, Jackson launched her , which later became the highest-grossing tour of her career. On March 8, 2023, Lifetime and A&amp;E greenlit a follow-up documentary series, \"Janet Jackson: Family First\". The series will follow Jackson as she prepares for her Together Again Tour as well as her and brother Randy's attempts to reunite the family band.\nOn December 30, 2024, Jackson began another Las Vegas concert residency, . On January 14, 2025, six shows were added for May of the same year. In September, she was featured on \"Principal\", a track from Cardi B's album \"Am I the Drama\", which samples Jackson's \"The Pleasure Principle\". The song debuted at number 92 on the Hot 100, making Jackson the first black female artist to chart new songs in five distinct decades.\nArtistry.\nMusic and voice.\nJackson possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range. Over the course of her career, she has received frequent criticism for the limitations of her vocal capabilities, especially in comparison to contemporary artists such as Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. In comparing her vocal technique to Houston and Aretha Franklin, vocal coach Roger Love states that \"[w]hen Janet sings, she allows a tremendous amount of air to come through. She's obviously aiming for a sexy, sultry effect, and on one level that works nicely. But actually, it's fairly limited.\" He adds that while her voice is suitable for studio recording, it doesn't translate well to the stage because despite having \"great songs, incredible dancing, and her star-like presence, the live show is still magnificent. But the voice is not the star.\"\nBiographer David Ritz commented, \"on Janet's albums\u2014and in her videos and live performances, which revealed a crisp, athletic dance technique [...] singing wasn't the point,\" saying emphasis was placed on \"her slamming beats, infectious hooks, and impeccable production values.\" Eric Henderson of \"Slant magazine\" claimed critics opposing her small voice \"somehow missed the explosive 'gimme a beat' vocal pyrotechnics she unleashes all over 'Nasty'\u00a0... Or that they completely dismissed how perfect her tremulous hesitance fits into the abstinence anthem 'Let's Wait Awhile'.\" Classical composer Louis Andriessen has praised Jackson for her \"rubato, sense of rhythm, sensitivity, and the childlike quality of her strangely erotic voice.\"\nSeveral critics also consider her voice to often be enveloped within her music's production. Wendy Robinson of \"PopMatters\" said \"the power of Janet Jackson's voice does not lie in her pipes. She doesn't blow, she whispers\u00a0... Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to.\"\nMatthew Perpetua of \"Fluxblog\" suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess \"a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks.\" Perpetua added: \"Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance\u00a0... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a fully-formed human being with contradictions and complexities.\"\nJackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres. Her records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince, as her producers are ex-members of the Time. Sal Cinquemani wrote that in addition to defining Top 40 radio, she \"gave Prince's Minneapolis sound a distinctly feminine\u2014and, with songs like 'What Have You Done for Me Lately?,' 'Nasty,' 'Control,' and 'Let's Wait Awhile,' a distinctly feminist\u2014spin.\"\nOn \"Control\", Richard J. Ripani documented that she, Jam, and Lewis had \"crafted a new sound that fuses the rhythmic elements of funk and disco, along with heavy doses of synthesizers, percussion, sound effects, and a rap music sensibility.\" Author Rickey Vincent stated that she has often been credited for redefining the standard of popular music with the industrial music beats of the album. She is considered a trendsetter in pop balladry, with Richard Rischar stating \"the black pop ballad of the mid-1980s had been dominated by the vocal and production style that was smooth and polished, led by singers Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson, and James Ingram.\"\nJackson continued her musical development by blending pop and urban music with elements of hip-hop in the nineties. This included a softer representation, articulated by lush, soulful ballads and up-tempo dance beats. She is described by music critic Greg Kot as \"an artist who has reshaped the sound and image of rhythm and blues\" within the first decade of her career. Critic Karla Peterson remarked that \"she is a sharp dancer, an appealing performer, and as 'That's the Way Love Goes' proves\u2014an ace pop-song writer.\" Selected material from the following decade has been viewed less favorably, as Sal Cinquemani comments \"except for maybe R.E.M., no other former superstar act has been as prolific with such diminishing commercial and creative returns.\"\nJackson has changed her lyrical focus over the years, becoming the subject of analysis in musicology, African American studies, and gender studies. David Ritz compared Jackson's musical style to Marvin Gaye's, stating, \"like Marvin, autobiography seemed the sole source of her music. Her art, also like Marvin's, floated over a reservoir of secret pain.\" Much of her success has been attributed to \"a series of powerful, metallic grooves; her chirpy, multi-tracked vocals; and a lyrical philosophy built on pride and self-knowledge.\" Ritz also stated, \"The mystery is the low flame that burns around the perimeters of Janet Jackson's soul. The flame feeds off the most highly combustible elements: survival and ambition, caution and creativity, supreme confidence and dark fear.\"\nDuring the 1980s, her lyrics embodied self-actualization, feminist principles, and politically driven ideology. Gillian G. Gaar described \"Control\" as \"an autobiographical tale about her life with her parents, her first marriage, and breaking free.\" Jessie Carney Smith wrote \"with that album, she asserted her independence, individuality, and personal power. She challenged audiences to see her as a transformed person, from an ing\u00e9nue to a grow-up, multi-talented celebrity.\" Referring to \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" as an embodiment of hope, Timothy E. Scheurer wrote \"It may remind some of Sly Stone prior to There's a Riot Going On and other African-American artists of the 1970s in its tacit assumption that the world imagined by Dr. King is still possible, that the American Dream is a dream for all people.\"\nOn \"Janet\", Jackson began focusing on sexual themes. Shayne Lee wrote that her music over the following decade \"brand[ed] her as one of the most sexually stimulating vocalists of the 1990s.\" Lilly J. Goren observed, \"Jackson's evolution from politically aware musician to sexy diva marked the direction that society and the music industry were encouraging the dance-rock divas to pursue.\" \"The Washington Post\" declared Jackson's public image over the course of her career had shifted \"from innocence to experience, inspiring such carnal albums as 1993's 'Janet' and 1997's 'The Velvet Rope', the latter of which explored the bonds\u2014figuratively and literally\u2014of love and lust.\"\nThe song \"Free Xone\" from \"The Velvet Rope\", which portrays same-sex relationships in a positive light, is described by sociologist Shayne Lee as \"a rare incident in which a popular black vocalist explores romantic or sensual energy outside the contours of heteronormativity, making it a significant song in black sexual politics.\" During the promotion for \"Janet\", she stated \"I love feeling deeply sexual\u2014and don't mind letting the world know. For me, sex has become a celebration, a joyful part of the creative process.\"\nUpon the release of \"Damita Jo\", Jackson stated \"Beginning with the earlier albums, exploring\u2014and liberating\u2014my sexuality has been an ongoing discovery and theme,\" adding \"As an artist, that's not only my passion, it's my obligation.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine has found Jackson's consistent inclusion of sex in her music lacking ingenuity, especially in comparisons to other artists such as Prince, stating \"while sex indisputably fuels much great pop music, it isn't an inherently fascinating topic for pop music\u2014as with anything, it all depends on the artist.\"\nVideos and stage.\nJackson drew inspiration for her music videos and performances from musicals she watched in her youth, and was heavily influenced by the choreography of Fred Astaire and Michael Kidd, among others. Throughout her career, she has worked with and brought numerous professional choreographers to prominence, such as Tina Landon, Paula Abdul, and Michael Kidd. Veronica Chambers declared, \"Her impact on pop music is undeniable and far-reaching,\" adding, \"A quick glance at the \"Billboard\" chart reveals any number of artists cast in the Janet Jackson mold.\" Chambers observed numerous videos which \"features not only Ms. Jackson's dancers, but choreography and sets remarkably like those she has used.\"\nJanine Coveney of \"Billboard\" observed that \"Jackson's musical declaration of independence [\"Control\"] launched a string of hits, an indelible production sound, and an enduring image cemented by groundbreaking video choreography and imagery that pop vocalists still emulate.\" Ben Hogwood of \"MusicOMH\" applauded the \"huge influence she has become on younger pretenders to her throne,\" most notably Britney Spears, Jennifer Lopez and Christina Aguilera. Qadree EI-Amin remarked that many pop artists \"pattern their performances after Janet's proven dance-diva persona.\" Beretta E. Smith-Shomade wrote that \"Jackson's impact on the music video sphere came largely through music sales successes, which afforded her more visual liberties and control. This assuming of control directly impacted the look and content of her music videos, giving Jackson an agency not assumed by many other artists\u2014male or female, Black or White.\"\n\"Parallel Lines: Media Representations of Dance\" (1993) documents that her videos have often been reminiscent of live concerts or elaborate musical theater. However, in her 30-minute \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" film, Jackson utilizes street dancing techniques in contrast to traditional choreography. The group dynamic visually embodies gender-neutral equality, with Jackson \"performing asexually and anonymously in front of, but as one of the members of the group.\" Her music videos have also contributed to a higher degree of sexual freedom among young women, with Jackson \"heavily implying male-on-female oral sex in music videos by pushing down on a man's head until he's in exactly the right position.\" However, accusations of cosmetic surgery, skin lightening, and increasingly hypersexual imagery have led to her being viewed as conforming to a white, male-dominated view of sexuality, rather than liberating herself or others.\nJackson received the MTV Video Vanguard Award for her contributions to the art form, and she became the first recipient of the MTV Icon tribute, celebrating her impact on the music industry as a whole. In 2003, \"Slant Magazine\" named \"Rhythm Nation\" and \"Got 'til It's Gone\" among the 100 Greatest Music Videos of all time, ranked at number 87 and number 10, respectively. In 2011, \"Rhythm Nation\" was voted the tenth best music video of the 1980s by \"Billboard\".\nIndependent Journalist Nicholas Barber stated \"Janet's concerts are the pop equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie, with all the explosions, special effects, ersatz sentimentality, gratuitous cleavage, and emphasis on spectacle over coherence that the term implies.\"\n\"Jet\" magazine reported \"Janet's innovative stage performances during her world tours have won her a reputation as a world-class performer.\" Chris Willman of the \"Los Angeles Times\" stated the \"enthralling\" choreography of Jackson's Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour \"represents the pinnacle of what can be done in the popping 'n' locking style\u2014a rapid-fire mixture of rigidly jerky and gracefully fluid movements.\" When Jackson was asked \"do you understand it when people talk about [The Velvet Rope Tour] in terms of Broadway?\", she responded, \"I'm crazy about Broadway ... That's what I grew up on.\"\nHer \"Number Ones: Up Close and Personal\" tour deviated from the full-scale theatrics found in her previous concert arena settings in favor of smaller venues. Critics noted being scaled down did not affect the impact of her showmanship, and in some cases, enhanced it. Greg Kot of the \"Chicago Tribune\" wrote, \"In past tours, Jackson's thin voice was often swallowed up by the sheer size of her production\u00a0... In the more scaled-down setting, Jackson brought a warmth and a passion that wasn't always evident in stadiums\u00a0... the best Janet Jackson performance I've covered in 20-plus years.\"\nThor Christensen of \"The Dallas Morning News\" reported Jackson often lip syncs in concert; he wrote: \"Janet Jackson\u2014one of pop's most notorious onstage lip-syncers\u2014conceded\u00a0... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals. But she refused to say what percentage of her concert 'voice' is taped and how much is live.\" Michael MacCambridge of the \"Austin American-Statesman\", who reviewed Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour, described lip-syncing as a \"moot point\", stating \"Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles.\" MacCambridge also observed \"it seemed unlikely that anyone\u2014even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music\u2014could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the '90s super concerts are expected to achieve.\"\nSimilarly, Chris Willman commented, \"even a classically trained vocalist would be hard-pressed to maintain any sort of level of volume\u2014or, more appropriately, 'Control'\u2014while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck speed.\" Critics observed that in the smaller scale of her \"Number Ones: Up Close and Personal\" tour, she forwent lip-syncing. Chris Richards of \"The Washington Post\" stated \"even at its breathiest, that delicate voice hasn't lost the laserlike precision.\"\nInfluences.\nJackson describes Lena Horne as a profound inspiration, for entertainers of several generations as well as herself. Upon Horne's death, she stated \"[Horne] brought much joy into everyone's lives\u2014even the younger generations, younger than myself. She was such a great talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself.\" Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols.\nJackson has declared herself \"a very big Joni Mitchell fan\", explaining: \"As a kid I was drawn to Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way.\" She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating \"Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be.\" She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration.\nIn her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine Jackson as musical influences.\nLegacy.\nThe youngest sister of the \"precious Jackson clan\", Jackson has striven to distance her professional career from that of her older brother Michael and the rest of the Jackson family. Steve Dollar of \"Newsday\" wrote that \"[s]he projects that home girl-next-door quality that belies her place as the youngest sibling in a family whose inner and outer lives have been as poked at, gossiped about, docudramatized and hard-copied as the Kennedys.\" Phillip McCarthy of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" noted that throughout her recording career, one of her common conditions for interviewers has been that there would be no mention of Michael. Joshua Klein wrote, \"[f]or the first half of her recording career, Janet Jackson sounded like an artist with something to prove. Emerging in 1982 just as big brother Michael was casting his longest shadow, Jackson filled her albums not so much with songs as with declarations, from 'The Pleasure Principle' to the radical-sounding 'Rhythm Nation' to the telling statement of purpose, 'Control'.\"\nSteve Huey of AllMusic asserted that despite being born into a family of entertainers, Jackson has managed to emerge a \"superstar\" in her own right, rivaling not only female recording artists including Madonna and Whitney Houston, but also her brother, while \"successfully [shifting] her image from a strong, independent young woman to a sexy, mature adult\". By forging her own unique identity through her artistry and her business ventures, she has been esteemed as the \"Queen of Pop\". Klein argued that \"stardom was not too hard to predict, but few could have foreseen that Janet\u2014Miss Jackson, if you're nasty\u2014would one day replace Michael as true heir to the Jackson family legacy.\".\nJackson has also been recognized for playing a pivotal role in crossing racial boundaries in the recording industry, where black artists were once considered to be substandard. Author Maureen Mahon states: \"In the 1980s, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Janet Jackson, and Prince were among the African American artists who crossed over\u00a0... When black artists cross over into pop success they cease to be black in the industry sense of the word. They get promoted from racialized black music to universal pop music in an economically driven process of racial transcendence.\" The \"Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge\" documented that Jackson, along with other prominent African-American women, had achieved financial breakthroughs in mainstream popular music, receiving \"superstar status\" in the process.\nShe, alongside her contemporaries \"offered viable creative, intellectual, and business paths for establishing and maintaining agency, lyrical potency, marketing and ownership\". Her business savvy has been compared to that of Madonna, gaining a level of autonomy which enables \"creative latitude and access to financial resources and mass-market distribution\". A model of reinvention, author Jessie Carney Smith wrote that \"Janet has continued to test the limits of her transformative power\", receiving accolades in music, film and concert tours throughout the course of her career.\nMusicologist Richard J. Ripani identified Jackson as a leader in the development of contemporary R&amp;B, as her music created a unique blend of genre and sound effects which ushered in the use of rap vocals into mainstream R&amp;B. He also argues her signature song \"Nasty\" influenced the new jack swing genre developed by Teddy Riley. Leon McDermott of the \"Sunday Herald\" wrote: \"Her million-selling albums in the 1980s helped invent contemporary R&amp;B through Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis's muscular, lean production; the sinuous grooves threaded through 1986's \"Control\" and 1989's \" Rhythm Nation 1814\" are the foundation upon which today's hotshot producers and singers rely.\" On March 24, 2021, the Library of Congress added \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" to the National Recording Registry's class of 2020, stating that the album still \"resonates today\".\nSimon Reynolds described Jackson's collaborations with her record producers as a reinvention of the dance-pop genre, introducing a new sonic palate. Den Berry, Virgin Records CEO and Chairman stated: \"Janet is the very embodiment of a global superstar. Her artistic brilliance and personal appeal transcend geographic, cultural and generational boundaries.\" In July 1999, she placed at number 77 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Women of Rock and Roll\". She also placed at number 134 on their list of the \"200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons of All Time\", number seven on the \"100 Greatest Women In Music\", and at number two on the \"50 Greatest Women of the Video Era\", behind Madonna.\nIn March 2008, Business Wire reported \"Jackson is one of the top ten selling artists in the history of contemporary music; ranked by \"Billboard\" magazine as the ninth most successful act in rock and roll history, and the second most successful female artist in pop music history.\" She is the only female artist in the history of the Hot 100 to have 18 consecutive top ten hit singles, from \"Miss You Much\" (1989) to \"I Get Lonely\" (1998). In 2008, the magazine ranked her at number seven on their Hot 100 50th Anniversary \"All-Time Top Artists\", making her the third most successful female artist in the history of the chart, following Madonna and Mariah Carey.\nIn November 2010, \"Billboard\" released its \"Top 50 R&amp;B / Hip-Hop Artists of the Past 25 Years\" list and ranked her at number five. She ranked as the top artist on the chart with 15 number ones from 1985 to 2010, garnering 27 top ten entries between 1985 and 2001, and 33 consecutive top 40 songs from 1985 through 2004. The magazine later ranked her at number 41 on its 2025 \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" list. A recipient of eleven \"Billboard\" Music Awards, she is one an elite group of musical acts, such as Madonna, Aerosmith, Garth Brooks and Eric Clapton, whom \"Billboard\" credits for \"redefining the landscape of popular music\".\nIn November 2014, Jackson was voted 'Queen of Pop' by a poll conducted online by VH1. In October 2015, she received her first nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and four years later was inducted to the Hall. Jackson's music and choreography have inspired numerous performers.\nVirgin Records executive Lee Trink expressed: \"Janet is an icon and historic figure in our culture. She's one of those gifted artists that people look up to, that people emulate, that people want to believe in\u00a0... there's not that many superstars that stand the test of time.\"\nSarah Rodman of the \"Boston Herald\" remarked: \"For every hand-fluttering, overwrought, melisma addict out there aping Mariah's dog calls, there's an equal number trying to match Jackson's bubbling grooves and fancy footwork, including Britney Spears, Aaliyah and Destiny's Child.\" Music critic Gene Stout commented she \"has so broadly influenced a younger generation of performers, from Jennifer Lopez\u00a0... to Britney Spears, who has copied so many of Jackson's dance moves.\" NSYNC and Usher have credited her for teaching them how to develop stage show into theatrical performance.\nElysa Gardner of \"USA Today\" wrote: \"Jackson claims not to be bothered by the brigade of barely post-adolescent baby divas who have been inspired by\u2014and, in some cases, have flagrantly aped\u2014the sharp, animated choreography and girlish but decidedly post-feminist feistiness that have long been hallmarks of her performance style.\" Adrienne Trier-Bieniek stated, \"scholars trace the origins of pleasure as a Black feminist commitment within popular culture to Janet Jackson\" who inspired the feminist perspective found in many pop stars' careers. Those who are considered to have followed in her footsteps have been referred to as \"Janet-come-lately's\". Sociologist Shayne Lee commented that \"[a]s Janet enters the twilight of her reign as erotic Queen of Pop, Beyonc\u00e9 emerges as her likely successor.\" Joan Morgan of \"Essence\" magazine remarked: \"Jackson's \"Control\", \"Rhythm Nation 1814\" and \"janet.\" established the singer-dancer imprimatur standard in pop culture we now take for granted. So when you're thinking of asking Miss Jackson, 'What have you done for me lately?' remember that Britney, Ciara and Beyonc\u00e9 live in the house that Janet built.\"\nJackson has also been considered a primary example of a musician maintaining an acting career, setting a template for artists such as Jennifer Lopez. Dan Shanoff stated, \"Before J-Lo even thought about being a singing-dancing-acting triple-threat... [Janet] was reinventing music videos, putting on a sick stage show and starring in both \"\"Good Times\" and \"Diff'rent Strokes\".\" MTV News observed her to inspire \"a slew of singers\" with her forays into film. Ashley Roberts stated, \"I always kind of went to the artists who, like Janet Jackson, was an artist, but would go off and do film,\" while Kat Graham commented, \"looking up to artists like Janet Jackson... I just don't know why you can't do it both.\"\nJackson has inspired performances by a number of actors, including Brit Marling, Olivia Wilde, Kate Hudson in \"Something Borrowed\", and Elizabeth Mathis in \"\", who stated, \"I got the part. So I owe it all to Janet.\" Tom Hanks praised the usage of Jackson's choreography within films. Jackson brought director Dominic Sena to prominence, leading him to direct films starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Jessica Alba cited her as the inspiration for her role in \"Honey\", saying, \"I grew up falling in love with Janet Jackson videos... And I wanted to be part of that.\" Jenna Dewan credits dancing with Jackson as the platform to star in \"Step Up\". She also influenced actors Michael K. Williams and Carmen Electra. Her choreography has also been incorporated in numerous Bollywood films.\nJackson's debut in \"Poetic Justice\" has inspired several trends. \"PopMatters\" said its spoken poetry theme started \"the spoken word explosion,\" influencing films such as \"Love Jones\" and \"Slam!\". \"The Fader\" considered Jackson's image as Justice iconic, declaring it \"one hell of a defining, iconoclastic moment that sticks in our brains and eventually disseminated through-and-through society.\" Her box braids in the film have become known as \"Janet Jackson Braids,\" setting fashion trends. An anecdote stated, \"celebrities continue to embrace Janet's look and continue to evoke the memory of John Singleton's classic character and film.\" Artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange Knowles were observed to emulate Jackson's braids. \"Nylon\" considered it the film's most iconic feature, comparing Jennifer Lawrence's \"side-winding French plait\" in \"The Hunger Games\" to the style.\nPersonal life.\nAt age 18, Janet Jackson eloped with singer James DeBarge in September 1984. The marriage was annulled in November 1985. In 1986, Jackson began dating dancer, songwriter, and director Ren\u00e9 Elizondo Jr. In March 1991, Jackson married Elizondo and the union was kept a secret until the divorce was made public in May 2000. They had separated in January 1999. Elizondo filed a lawsuit against her, estimated to have been between $10\u201325\u00a0million. A settlement was reached and the divorce was finalized in October 2003. From 2002 to 2009, Jackson dated music producer, rapper, and songwriter Jermaine Dupri.\nJackson was introduced to Qatari businessman Wissam Al Mana in October 2006, and began dating him in 2010. The couple became engaged and married privately in 2012. In January 2017, aged 50, Jackson gave birth to their son, Eissa Al Mana. In April 2017, it was reported that the couple had separated and were pursuing a divorce, which was announced by Jackson the following month.\nDiscography.\nStudio albums\nTours and residencies.\nConcert tours\nConcert residencies\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was established on July 25, 1797, by the Franciscan order, on a site chosen specifically due to the large number of Salinan Indians that inhabited the area, whom the Spanish priests wanted to evangelize.\nThe mission remains in use as a parish church of the Diocese of Monterey. After being closed to the public for six years due to the 2003 San Simeon earthquake, the church reopened on September 29, 2009. Inside the church are murals designed by Esteban Munras.\nThe mission was put on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 and was named to a National Historic Landmark in 2006. Of California's missions, it is one that retains more than most of its layout and buildings, including a portion of its neophyte village.\nHistory.\nFather Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n and Father Buenaventura Sitjar founded the mission on July 25, 1797, making it the sixteenth California mission. Its location between Mission San Luis Obispo and Mission San Antonio de Padua provided a stop on the trip that had previously taken two days.\nA temporary wooden church was built with living quarters. The site was chosen as it was close to a Salinan Indian village called Vahca. In 1798 the small chapel was replaced. From 1816 to 1818 a new church was constructed with a tile roof and courtyard.\nMission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel land was sold off after the Mexican secularization act of 1833. The William Reed family lived in the buildings until 1848, when they were murdered by a band of thieves. The killers were tracked down by a posse in the foothills of Santa Barbara. Two thieves died in the ensuing battle, and the other three were tried and executed by firing squad. Upon secularization, the mission began to decay. Padre Abella, the last Franciscan at San Miguel, died in July, 1841.\nIn 1859 the U.S. government returned the mission to the Catholic Church. But with the buildings in poor condition, no priests were assigned to the mission; buildings were rented to some small businesses. In 1878 the Church reactivated the mission, and Rev. Philip Farrelly took up residence as First Pastor of Mission San Miguel. In 1928 the mission was returned to the Franciscan Padres, the same group who had founded the mission in 1797.\nMission bells.\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells.\nAssociated structures.\nThe Rios-Caledonia Adobe was built in 1835 just south of the San Miguel Mission as a home for the overseer of Mission lands. This historic site is well preserved with the original Inn and Stagecoach stop now a museum and small gift shop. A building was added in 1930 that is now a unique history research library. The grounds are maintained by San Luis Obispo County Parks with picnic sites and restrooms available.\nThe Historic Rios-Caledonia Adobe is a California Historical Landmark (#936) and is listed on the National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places (#71000190).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Intuitively, the unknot is a closed loop of rope without a knot tied into it, unknotted. To a knot theorist, an unknot is any embedded topological circle in the 3-sphere that is ambient isotopic (that is, deformable) to a geometrically round circle, the standard unknot.\nThe unknot is the only knot that is the boundary of an embedded disk, which gives the characterization that only unknots have Seifert genus 0. Similarly, the unknot is the identity element with respect to the knot sum operation.\nUnknotting problem.\nDeciding if a particular knot is the unknot was a major driving force behind knot invariants, since it was thought this approach would possibly give an efficient algorithm to recognize the unknot from some presentation such as a knot diagram. Unknot recognition is known to be in both NP and co-NP.\nIt is known that knot Floer homology and Khovanov homology detect the unknot, but these are not known to be efficiently computable for this purpose. It is not known whether the Jones polynomial or finite type invariants can detect the unknot.\nExamples.\nIt can be difficult to find a way to untangle string even though the fact it started out untangled proves the task is possible. Thistlethwaite and Ochiai provided many examples of diagrams of unknots that have no obvious way to simplify them, requiring one to temporarily increase the diagram's crossing number. Such cases are known as hard unknots.\nWhile rope is generally not in the form of a closed loop, sometimes there is a canonical way to imagine the ends being joined together. From this point of view, many useful practical knots are actually the unknot, including those that can be tied in a bight.\nEvery tame knot can be represented as a linkage, which is a collection of rigid line segments connected by universal joints at their endpoints. The stick number is the minimal number of segments needed to represent a knot as a linkage, and a stuck unknot is a particular unknotted linkage that cannot be reconfigured into a flat convex polygon. Like crossing number, a linkage might need to be made more complex by subdividing its segments before it can be simplified.\nInvariants.\nThe Alexander\u2013Conway polynomial and Jones polynomial of the unknot are trivial:\n formula_1\nNo other knot with 10 or fewer crossings has trivial Alexander polynomial, but the Kinoshita\u2013Terasaka knot and Conway knot (both of which have 11 crossings) have the same Alexander and Conway polynomials as the unknot. It is an open problem whether any non-trivial knot has the same Jones polynomial as the unknot.\nThe unknot is the only knot whose knot group is an infinite cyclic group, and its knot complement is homeomorphic to a solid torus.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The mission was founded on September 8, 1797 at the site of Achooykomenga, and was the seventeenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions established in Alta California. Named for Saint Ferdinand, the mission is the namesake of the nearby city of San Fernando and the San Fernando Valley.\nThe mission was secularized in 1834 and returned to the Catholic Church in 1861; it became a working church in 1920. Today the mission grounds function as a museum; the church is a chapel of ease of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.\nHistory.\nIn 1769, the Spanish Portol\u00e0 expedition \u2013 the first Europeans to see inland areas of California \u2013 traveled north through the San Fernando Valley. On August 7 they camped at a watering place near where the mission would later be established. Fray Juan Cresp\u00ed, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, noted in his diary that the camp was \"at the foot of the mountains\".\nFounding.\nMission San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a was the 17th of 21 Franciscan missions established in Alta California. The Rancho of Francisco Reyes (then the \"Alcalde\" of the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles), which included the agricultural settlement of Achooykomenga worked by Venture\u00f1o Chumash, Fernande\u00f1o (Tongva), and Tataviam laborers, was approved by the \"padres\" as a suitable site for the Mission. After brief negotiations with the \"Alcalde\", the land was acquired (Mission records list Reyes as godfather to the first infant baptized at San Fernando).\nThe mission was founded on September 8, 1797 by Father Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n who, with the assistance of Fray Francisco Dumetz and in the presence of troops and natives, performed the ceremonies and dedicated the mission to San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a, making it the fourth mission site he had established; ten children were baptized on the first day. Fray Francisco Dumetz and his associate Fray Francisco Javier Ur\u00eda labored in the mission until after 1800.\nEarly in October 1797, 13 adults were baptised and the first marriage took place on October 8. At the end of the year, there were 55 neophytes. By 1800, there were 310 neophytes, 352 baptisms, and 70 deaths.\nThe mission church was finished months after its establishment and the first baptism recorded to have occurred in the church was on November 28, 1797. The first church was an 8 vara (22 feet) long adobe structure; within two years, the church was too small for services and a second 23 by 7\u00bc vara (63 by 20 feet) adobe church was built which served the mission for five more years.\n1800s.\nIn 1801, a 106 vara (291 feet) addition to the workshops was built and formed the south wing of the workshop courtyard; it included two granaries which became wine and \"aguardiente\" factories, two small rooms for missionaries, a weaving room, and a dormitory with a small courtyard for neophyte girls and single women. Six adjoining houses of unreported dimensions were built as a single structure directly northwest of the church which were assigned as a \"cuartel\"; they contained a storeroom, barracks, a kitchen, and a house containing a reception room and along with two other rooms.\nThe mission workshops' courtyard was closed into a square in 1802 with the addition of a 100 vara (275\u00a0ft.) east wing addition which contained another granary, a flour mill, candle factory and a carpentry shop.\nFray Dumetz left the mission in April 1802, then returned in 1804. Construction on the third church began in 1804 and Spanish carpenter Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez, who was active in the mission from 1805 to 1806, is considered the church architect; the church along with its sacristy and carpentry, cart, and plow shops formed the full approximately 133 vara (365.75\u00a0ft.) north wing. Construction of about seventy adobe rooms for indigenous neophytes, arranged in the shape of a U, and located southwest of the convento, also began in 1804 as well as a detached tallow vat attached to the northeast corner of the quadrangle and a detached row of adobe and stone buildings running north and south to the south of the quadrangle. This last row of buildings contained olive and grain storerooms, horse stables, a tannery and a soap factory or tallow vat called a \"jaboner\u00eda\".\nIn 1805, Fray Dumetz left the mission along with Fray Ur\u00eda who left the country and Fray Nicol\u00e1s L\u00e1zaro and Fray Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Zalvidea arrived at the mission; the latter was transferred to San Gabriel in 1806. Prior to the completion of the church in 1806, the bell tower was built adjacent to the church and was integrated into the workshop quadrangle's west wing. The new 60 by 14 vara (165 by 38 feet) adobe and tile-roofed church was blessed on December 6, 1806, by Fray Pedro Mu\u00f1oz from Mission San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel.\nFray Zalvidea died at San Diego in August 1807 and \"padres\" Jos\u00e9 Antonio Ur\u00eda and Pedro Mu\u00f1oz arrived the same year; the former retired in November 1808 and was succeeded by Fray Mart\u00edn de Landaeta while Fray Jos\u00e9 Antonio Urresti arrived in 1809 and became the associate of Fray Mu\u00f1oz. Fray Landaeta died in 1816.\nDuring the first decade of the century, the neophyte population increased from 310 to 955, there had been 797 deaths, and 1468 baptisms. The largest number of baptisms in any one year was 361 in 1803.\nIn 1804 there was a land controversy where the \"padres\" successfully protested against the granting of the Rancho Camulos to Francisco \u00c1vila.\n1810s.\nBy the 1810s with the onset of the Mexican War of Independence as well as the conflict with France in Spain, support of the missions by the Spanish government largely disappeared and the missions had to largely fend for themselves and soldier's wages were no longer being paid; this caused economic pressures that led to a decline in the quality of life and productivity of the mission communities.\nA convento building to house the friars began to be constructed in 1810 and was written about in the friar's annual report at the end of the year. Little is known about this initial structure's dimensions and exact location. The master carpenter Salvador Carabantes was employed to work on the convento as early as February 1811 and he continued to work at the mission until his death in February 1813. The building continued to be expanded whenever materials and resources were available into the next decade.\nFray Urresti died in 1812 and was succeeded by Fray Joaqu\u00edn Pascual Nuez in 1812 to 1814, Fray Vincente Pascual Oliva was stationed in the mission from 1814 to 1815. Fray Pedro Mu\u00f1oz left California in 1817, and his place was taken by Fray Marcos Antonio de Vitoria from 1818 to 1820. Fray Ram\u00f3n Ulibarri arrived in January and Fray Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez de Ibarra in October 1820. On December 21, 1812, an earthquake hit the area which caused enough damage to necessitate the introduction of 20 new beams to support the church wall. Before 1818, a new chapel was completed. In 1818, another \"jaboner\u00eda\" was built in the detached buildings south of the quadrangle with two boilers and holes to accept firewood, this is the only \"jaboner\u00eda\" left in modern times and is still visible in Brand Park. In the period of 1810 to 1820 the population increased slightly, reaching its highest figure, 1,080, in 1819, after which its decline began.\nThe soldiers' unpaid wages were being supplanted by supplies and food produced in the missions which put further pressure on the neophyte indigenous labor force. The neophytes faced an increase in abuses and the insufficient harvests led to starvation which pushed more and more of them to flee the missions.\n1820s.\nAfter Fray Ulibarri died in 1821, Fray Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez de Ibarra was stationed alone in the mission. Ibarra wrote letters to the commander of the troops complaining of the starvation caused by the soldiers' demands.\nBeginning of the Mexican era.\nAfter the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain on September 27, 1821, the province of Alta California became the Mexican Territory of Alta California. The missions continued under the rule of Mexico.\nFray Ibarra began to complain that the soldiers of his guard were causing problems by selling liquor and lending horses to the natives and in 1825, he declared that \"the presidio was a curse rather than a help to the mission, that the soldiers should go to work and raise grain, and not live on the toil of the Indians, whom they robbed and deceived with talk of liberty while in reality they treated them as slaves.\" This led to a sharp reply from Captain Guerra, who advised the \"Padre\" to modify his tone. The amount of supplies furnished by the mission to the presidio from 1822 to April 1827 amounted to $21,203.\n1830s and secularization.\nGovernor Jos\u00e9 Figeroa officially secularized the mission in October 1834, Comisionado Teniente Antonio del Valle took charge of the mission estates by inventory from Fray Ibarra. From then, the mission was to be a parish of the second class with a $1000 salary. Lieutenant del Valle became the mission \"mayordomo\" on May 29, 1835. Fray Ibarra opposed the appointment of del Valle as mayordomo. After secularization, many of the former neophytes returned to their lands while others remained to work at the ranches near the mission in return for low wages and some shelter.\nThe Mexican government had planned to send all Spanish-born friars back to Spain; however, Fray Ibarra was allowed to stay at the mission and he continued his labors alone until the middle of 1835 when he retired to Mexico. His successor was Fray Pedro Cabot from San Antonio who was stationed until his death in October 1836. Anastasio Carrillo succeeded Lieutenant Antonio del Valle as mayordomo on January 3, 1837.\nAfter Fray Cabot's death, there is no mention of a missionary at San Fernando until August 1838 when Fray Blas Ordaz remained there during the rest of the decade. Fray Ordaz was the last resident Franciscan in the mission and remained as the mission curate until June 30, 1847. Down to 1834, the neophyte population decreased by less than 100 and the mission remained productive.\nIn 1842, six years before the California Gold Rush, a brother of the mission mayordomo made the first Alta California gold discovery in the foothills near the mission. In memory of that discovery, the place was given the name Placerita Canyon, but only small quantities of gold were found.\nIn 1845, Governor P\u00edo Pico declared the Mission buildings for sale under the secularization act of 1833 and, in 1846, turned the mission into the headquarters of the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando.\nFray Ordaz took charge of Mission San Gabriel, but would occasionally return to perform religious services until February 1849. The secularization's requirement of a diocesan replacement of the regular clergy was met on May 28, 1848, when Reverend Jos\u00e9 M. Rosales officially took charge of the mission, allowing it to become another secular curato of Alta California; however, the mission settlement was not replaced with a pueblo as the mission buildings had been turned into the property of the private rancho and could no longer be used to establish a settlement. The former convento became a storage room and living quarters for rancho workers and the mission buildings were neglected.\nLater history.\nThe Mission was used in a number of ways during the late 19th century: north of the mission was the site of Lopez Station for the Butterfield Stage Lines; it served as a warehouse for the Porter Land and Water Company; and in 1896, the quadrangle was used as a hog farm. In 1861, the Mission buildings and 75 acres of land were returned to the church after Charles Fletcher Lummis acted for preservation. The buildings were disintegrating as beams, tiles and nails were taken from the church by settlers. San Fernando's church became a working church again in 1923 when the Oblate priests arrived. Many attempts were made to restore the old Mission from the early 20th century, but it was not until the Hearst Foundation gave a large gift of money in the 1940s, that the Mission was finally restored. The museum became the repository for heirlooms of the Mexican church evacuated during the Cristero revolt, and also holds part of the Doheny library. The church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971, but was extensively damaged by the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, and was completely rebuilt. Repairs were completed in 1974. It continues to be very well cared for and is still used as a chapel-of-ease. The Convento Building was separately listed on the Register in 1988. In 2003, comedian Bob Hope, a late-life convert to Catholicism, was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens; followed by his widow Dolores Hope in 2011.\nMission industries.\nThe goals of the missions were, first, to spread the message of Christianity and, second, to establish a Spanish colony. Because of the difficulty of delivering supplies by sea, the missions had to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Toward that end, neophytes were taught European-style farming, animal husbandry, mechanical arts and domestic crafts like tallow candle making.\nThe San Fernando Mission was known for having good quality wines and around the mission walls there were over 32,000 grapevines from which the neophytes produced wine; at the peak of its production, the mission produced about 2,000 gallons of wine and 2,000 gallons of \"aguardiente\". The mission also contained about 70 acres of olive trees which were collected and crushed to make olive oil. The men of the mission community spent their days working in the fields or in the mission workshops and buildings; they were charged with tending to the cattle, horses and sheep as well as growing wheat, barley, peas, beans, corn, figs, and peaches. The women were charged with weaving in the workrooms to produce the cloth used in the mission. Sundays and holy days were dedicated to rest and prayer.\nMission bells.\nBells were vitally important to daily life at any mission. The bells were rung at mealtimes, to call the Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bell. The residents as referred to above were called neophytes (Indigenous persons) after baptism. There were five bells at the mission from 1769 to 1931.\nA hundred-pound bell was unearthed in an orange grove near the Mission in 1920. It carried the following inscription (translated from Russian): \"\"In the Year 1796, in the month of January, this bell was cast on the Island of Kodiak by the blessing of Archimandrite Joaseph, during the sojourn of Alexsandr Baranov\".\" It is not known how this Russian Orthodox artifact from Kodiak, Alaska made its way to a Catholic mission in Southern California.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This Mission lent its name to the Luise\u00f1o tribe of Mission Indians.\nAt its prime, Mission San Luis Rey's structures and services compound covered almost , making it the largest of the Californian missions, along with its surrounding agricultural land. Multiple outposts were built in support of Mission San Luis Rey and placed under its supervision, including the San Antonio de Pala Asistencia in 1816 and the Las Flores Estancia in 1823.\nSpanish era.\nThe full name of the mission is \"La Misi\u00f3n de San Luis, Rey de Francia\" (The Mission of Saint Louis, King of France). It was named for King Louis IX of France. Its nickname is \"King of the Missions\". It was founded by padre Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n on June 12, 1798, the eighteenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions built in the Alta California Province of the Viceroyalty of New Spain. In 1800, Mission olive trees were first planted at the Mission; by 1876, only seven of the mission's olive trees were alive.\nThe current church, built in 1815, is the third church on this location. It is a National Historic Landmark, for its pristine example of a Spanish mission church complex. Today the mission complex functions as a parish church of the Diocese of San Diego as well as a museum and retreat center. Mission San Luis Rey De Francia raised about 26,000 cattle as well as goats, geese, and pigs.\nAn early account of life at the Mission was written by one of its Native American converts, Luise\u00f1o Pablo Tac, in his work \"Indian Life and Customs at Mission San Luis Rey: A Record of California Mission Life by Pablo Tac, An Indian Neophyte\" (written c.\u20091835 in Rome, later edited and translated in 1958 by Minna Hewes and Gordon Hewes). In his book, Tac lamented the rapid population decline of his Luise\u00f1o people after the founding of the mission:\nIn Quechla not long ago there were 5,000 souls, with all their neighboring lands. Through a sickness that came to California, 2,000 souls died, and 3,000 were left.\nThe Mission-born, Franciscan-educated Tac wrote that his people initially attempted to bar the Spaniards from invading their Southern California lands. Pablo Tac went on to describe the preferential conditions and treatment the padres received:\nIn the mission of San Luis Rey de Francia the Fernandino [\"sic\"] father is like a king. He has his pages, alcaldes, majordomos, musicians, soldiers, gardens, ranchos, livestock...\nMexican era.\nThe first Peruvian Pepper Tree (\"Schinus molle\") in California was planted here in 1830, now iconic, widely planted, and renamed the \"California Pepper tree\" in the state. After the Mexican secularization act of 1833 much of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia land was sold off. Indigenous peoples, previously forced to work on missions, were freed from direct subjugation in the mission system through this act. When Native people at San Luis Rey learned of their impending freedom, they proclaimed together: \"We are free! We do not want to obey! We do not want to work!\" and left the mission by the thousands, returning to their rural communities \"which in some cases their forebears had left two generations earlier.\"\nDuring the Mexican\u2013American War in Alta California (1846\u20131847), the Mission was utilized as a military outpost by the United States Army. In July 1847, U.S. military governor of California Richard Barnes Mason created an Indian sub-agency at Mission San Luis Rey, and his men took charge of the mission property in August, appointing Jesse Hunter from the recently arrived Mormon Battalion as sub-agent. Battalion guide Jean Baptiste Charbonneau, the Native American Shoshone child of Sacagawea who had traveled with the Lewis and Clark Expedition forty years earlier, was appointed by Mason as the Alcalde \"within the District of San Diego, at or near San Luis Rey\" in November 1847. Charbonneau resigned from the post in August, 1848, claiming that \"because of his Indian heritage others thought him biased when problems arose between the Indians and the other inhabitants of the district.\"\nAmerican era.\nWith secularization of the mission in 1834, no religious services were held and the Luise\u00f1o were left behind by the fleeing Franciscan padres. The Mission's religious services restarted in 1893, when two Mexican priests were given permission to restore the Mission as a Franciscan college. Father Joseph O'Keefe was assigned as an interpreter for the monks. It was he who began to restore the old Mission in 1895. The \"cuadr\u00e1ngulo\" (quadrangle) and church were completed in 1905. San Luis Rey College was opened as a seminary in 1950, but closed in 1969.\nEpisodes 2, 3, 4 and 12 of the Disney-produced \"Zorro\" TV series include scenes filmed in 1957 at San Luis Rey, which doubled for the Mission of San Gabriel. Disney added a skull and crossbones to the cemetery entrance.\nIn 1998, Gilbert Levine led members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and, with the special permission of Pope John Paul II, the ancient Cappella Giulia Choir of St. Peter's Basilica, the first-ever visit of this 500-year-old choir to the Western Hemisphere, in a series of concerts to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the mission, broadcast on NPR's \"Performance Today\". In February 2013, the seismic retrofitting was completed.\nToday, Mission San Luis Rey de Francia is a working mission, cared for by the people who belong to the parish, with ongoing restoration projects. Mission San Luis Rey has a Museum, Visitors' Center, Retreat Center, gardens with the historic Pepper Tree, and the original small cemetery.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded on September 17, 1804, by Father Est\u00e9van Tap\u00eds of the Franciscan order, the mission site was chosen as a midway point between Mission Santa Barbara and Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n, and was designed to relieve overcrowding at those two missions and to serve the Indians living north of the Coast Range. \"Sunset\" magazine editors wrote of the Hidden Gem of the Missions: \u201cWith its simple, straightforward exterior, Santa In\u00e9s fits one\u2019s impression of how a ripe old mission should look.\u201d\nThe mission was home to the first learning institution in Alta California and today serves as a museum as well as a parish church of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. It is also designated a National Historic Landmark, noted as one of the best-preserved of the 21 California missions.\nHistory.\nMost of the original church was destroyed on December 21, 1812, in an earthquake centered near Santa Barbara that damaged or destroyed several California missions. The quake also severely damaged other mission buildings, but the complex was not abandoned. A new church, constructed with walls and great pine beams brought from nearby Figueroa Mountain, was dedicated on July 4, 1817. \nA water-powered grist mill was built in 1819, about half a mile from the church.\nIn 1821, a fulling mill was added, designed by newly arrived American immigrant Joseph John Chapman. He oversaw the building of a grist mill for Mission San Gabriel, and he prepared timbers for the construction of the first church in Los Angeles. The mill he built near San Gabriel is now a museum. Chapman was baptized at Mission Basilica San Buenaventura in 1822, and that same year married Guadalupe Ortega of Santa Barbara, with whom he had five children. In 1824, Chapman bought land in Los Angeles and developed a vineyard, but still continued to perform odd jobs at the missions.\nOn February 21, 1824, a soldier beat a young Chumash native. Two separate Chumash accounts, written in the early 1900s, state that around the time the tribesman was beaten a Spanish page overheard Santa In\u00e9s priests talking about having the natives of the mission killed the next summer when they arrived. The page was found out by the priests after having alerted the natives, and his tongue and feet were cut off before he was burned to death. Upon learning of this news, the natives sought the help of the other Santa Barbara Channel Mission natives and a week later the Chumash revolt of 1824 was sparked. When the fighting was over, the natives themselves put out the fire that had started at the mission. Many of the Indians left to join other tribes in the mountains; only a few Chumash remained at the mission.\nIn 1833, the missions in California began to be secularized, however, it was not until 1835 that the Santa In\u00e9s Mission became secularized by the Mexican government. Secularization involved replacing the padres as managers of the missions with government appointed overseers. In this case, the existing Spanish Franciscans were replaced by Mexican Franciscans who were restricted to provide only for the spiritual needs of the Chumash. The Chumash were mistreated under this new policy and began to leave the mission, returning to their villages or working at settlers\u2019 ranches. As a result, much of their land was given to settlers in land grants.\nIn 1843, California's Mexican governor Micheltorena granted of Santa Ynez Valley land, called Rancho Ca\u00f1ada de los Pinos, to the College of Our Lady of Refuge, the first seminary in California. Established at the mission by Francisco Garc\u00eda Diego y Moreno, the first bishop of California, the college was abandoned in 1881. By then the mission buildings were disintegrating.\nHighwayman Jack Powers briefly took over Mission Santa In\u00e9s and the adjacent Rancho San Marcos in 1853, intending to rustle the cattle belonging to rancher Nicolas A. Den. Powers was defeated in a bloodless armed confrontation. He was not ousted from the Santa Barbara area until 1855.\nThe Danish town of Solvang was built up around the mission proper in the early 1900s. It was through the efforts of Father Alexander Buckler in 1904 that reconstruction of the mission was undertaken, though major restoration was not possible until 1947 when the Hearst Foundation donated money to pay for the project. The restoration continues by the Capuchin Franciscan Fathers.\nIndigenous people.\nThe Alta California mission system was founded by Catholic priests of the Franciscan order to evangelize the Native Americans. The missionaries introduced European fruits, vegetables, cattle, horses, ranching, and technology. The natives at Santa In\u00e9s were used as laborers and the mission's agriculture caused great ecological changes in the environment. Archaeobotanical analysis displayed that the agricultural efforts at Santa In\u00e9s are specifically responsible for integrating pea, squash, potato, cabbage, olive, grape, pear, apricot, hemp, peach, carrot, etc. into the environment. It was not long after the placement of the missions that European plants and weeds proliferated throughout California's coast.\nMany Natives of missions in the Southwestern region of what is presently U.S. territory and North Mexico fell victim to Euro-Asiatic diseases to which they had no immunity; such as those of the Pimer\u00eda Alta and Baja California missions. However, demographic studies have shown that the Santa Barbara Channel Missions (Santa In\u00e9s, Santa Barbara, San Buenaventura, and La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n) and many other Alta California Missions do not exactly follow this trend. Though the missions were not free of epidemics, the censuses taken in the 1800s display that women and children had a much higher mortality rate than men. Diseases are not partial to gender or age, which meant that something outside of disease had a drastic effect on the Indian population in the missions.\nResearchers discovered that the population decline was focused by the unique conditions of the Alta California missions: very tight, overcrowded living arrangements which fostered the spread of diseases. These conditions were met as a part of the program the missions made to culturally and religiously change the Natives. For instance, to control the sexual intercourse of the women, the Franciscans would lock up all the single women together at night in small, damp rooms.\nRestoration of the Mission.\nThe Santa Ines Mission is one of the oldest surviving structures in the state of California and requires constant efforts to repair and restore. Over the years, many men and women have labored in order to preserve, maintain, and restore the historical landmark. Efforts in the past have included restoration of buildings that are made out of adobe (dried mud) to ensure structural stability. The structures made out of adobe are particularly susceptible to the elements, soil shifts, and earthquakes. Without proper conservation, the Santa Ines Mission walls will crack and the artwork will fade.\nParishioners are largely responsible for the efforts put forth in restoring Mission Santa Ines, although, non-parishioners have contributed as well. The parish does not receive state or federal funding, instead they get their funds through museum entrance fees, fundraisers, and donations from individuals and foundations. Individual contributions and grants from private foundations such as the California Mission Foundation has also significantly helped restoration efforts in the past.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The site's milder weather was believed to aid the rehabilitation of patients. It was not intended to be a stand-alone mission, but was granted full mission status in 1822 as it grew and prospered.\nThe mission fell into severe disrepair by the 1860's, giving it the ignoble distinction as the \"most obliterated\" Spanish mission in California. A new parish church was built in 1861 and the mission ruins were entirely removed in 1870. The site was replaced by the Saint Raphael Parish complex, where the modern-day replica was built in 1949, in front of the modern Saint Raphael's Church.\nHistory.\n Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel was founded on December 14, 1817, by Father Vicente Francisco de Sarr\u00eda, as a medical \"asistencia\" (\"sub-mission\") of the San Francisco Mission to treat their sick population. After its opening, hundreds of indigenous people suffering from illness were transferred to the asistencia from the San Francisco Mission. It was granted full mission status on October 19, 1822. The mission's grain production in 1831 amounted to 774 fanegas of wheat, 130 of corn, 15 of beans, 388 of barley, and 20 of other legumes, amounting to 1327 fanegas of grain. In the same year, the mission owned 1200 heads of black cattle, 450 horses, 1 mule, 2000 sheep, and 17 pigs.\nThis was one of the missions turned over to the Mexican government in 1833 after the Mexican secularization act of 1833. According to Alexander Forbes, the 1835 mission population was 1027. In 1840, there were 150 Native Americans still at the Mission. By 1844, Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel had been abandoned; what was left of the empty buildings was sold for $8,000 in 1846. The Mission was used by John C. Fremont as his headquarters during the Bear Flag Revolt.\nOn June 28, 1846, three men departed the mission, including Kit Carson, and murdered three unarmed Californians under the order of John C. Fremont: Don Jos\u00e9 R. Berreyesa, father of Jos\u00e9 de los Santos Berreyesa, along with the twin sons of Don Francisco de Haro, Ramon and Francisco De Haro.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hbbegd.htm group=dab\"&gt;The Beginnings of San Francisco App. D \u2013 The Murder of Berreyesa and the De Haros&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn 1847, a priest was once again living at the Mission. A new parish church was built near the old chapel ruins in 1861, and, in 1870, the rest of the ruins were removed to make room for the City of San Rafael. All that was left of the Mission was a single pear tree from the old Mission's orchard. It is for this reason that San Rafael is known as the \"most obliterated of California's missions\".\nIn 1949, a replica of the chapel was built next to the current Saint Raphael's Church on the site of the original hospital in San Rafael, California which was built in 1919.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60083", "revid": "38455", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60083", "title": "Lapidary", "text": "Shaping of gemstones for jewelry\nLapidary (from la\u00a0'stone, stony') is the practice of shaping stone, minerals, or gemstones into decorative items such as cabochons, engraved gems (including cameos), and faceted designs. A person who practices lapidary techniques of cutting, grinding, and polishing is known as a lapidary or lapidarist. Hardstone carving requires specialized carving techniques.\nIn modern contexts, a gemcutter is a person who specializes in cutting diamonds, but in older contexts the term refers to artists who produced hardstone carvings; engraved gems such as jade carvings, a branch of miniature sculpture or ornament in gemstone.\nBy extension, the term \"lapidary\" has sometimes been applied to collectors of and dealers in gems, or to anyone who is knowledgeable in precious stones.\nEtymology.\nThe etymological root of the word \"lapidary\" is the Latin word , meaning \"stone\". In the 14th century, the term evolved from , meaning 'stonecutter' or 'working with stone', into the Old French word , meaning 'one skilled in working with precious stones'.\nIn French, and later English, the term is also used for a lapidary text, which was a treatise on precious stones that details their appearance, formation, and properties\u2014particularly in terms of the powers believed to be held by some stones\u2014as believed in medieval Europe. The beliefs about the powers of stones included their ability to prevent harm, heal ailments, or offer health benefits. \"Lapidary\" appeared as an English adjective in the 18th century.\nHistory.\nThe earliest known lapidary work likely occurred during the Stone Age. As people created tools from stone, they realized that some geological materials were harder than others. The next earliest documented examples of what could be considered lapidary arts came in the form of drilling stone and rock. The earliest roots of drilling rocks date back to approximately one million years ago.\nThe early Egyptians developed cutting and jewelry fashioning methods for lapis lazuli, turquoise, and amethyst.\nThe art of lapidary was relatively well-developed in the Indian subcontinent by the early 1st millennium CE. The surviving manuscripts of the 3rd century Buddhist text by Buddha Bhatta, and several Hindu texts of mid-1st millennium CE such as and , are Sanskrit treatises on lapidary arts. They discuss sources of gems and diamonds, their origins, qualities, testing, cutting and polishing, and making jewelry from them. Several other Sanskrit texts on gems and lapidary arts have been dated to post-10th century, suggesting a continuous lapidary practice.\nAccording to Jason Hawkes and Stephanie Wynne-Jones, archaeological evidence suggests that trade in lapidary products between Africa and India was established in the 1st millennium CE. People of the Deccan region of India and those near the coast of East Africa had innovated their own techniques for lapidary before the 10th century, as evidenced by excavations and Indian and non-Indian texts dated to that period.\nLapidary was also a significant tradition in early Mesoamerica. The lapidary products were used as status symbols, for offerings, and during burials. They were made from shell, jade, turquoise, and greenstones. Aztec lapidarists used string saws and drills made of reed and bone as their lapidary tools.\nMedieval lapidaries.\nThe history of lapidaries can be traced back to the classical world, where writers like Theophrastus and Pliny the Elder laid the foundations for later medieval interpretations of gemstones. In his examination of \"lyngurium\"\u2014a mythical gemstone described by Theophrastus\u2014Steven A. Walton discusses how classical knowledge was transmitted and adapted in medieval lapidary traditions. Despite the mythical nature of some of these stones, medieval lapidaries continued to draw on classical sources, blending scientific knowledge with magical beliefs. Walton highlights how these texts cataloged stones not only for their aesthetic and material properties but also for their purported magical and medicinal functions, making lapidaries sources essential for texts for both scholars and practitioners of natural philosophy during the medieval period.\nIn Anglo-Saxon England, lapidaries became particularly significant as both medical and religious guides. Peter Kitson traces the transmission of lapidary knowledge into early medieval England, emphasizing how these texts informed by Lapidaries functioned as practical manuals for physicians, clergy, and scholars. The \"Old English Lapidary\", for instance, detailed the healing properties of stones, reflecting the belief that gemstones could cure illnesses and provide spiritual protection. Kitson argues that lapidaries in this period served a dual purpose: they were not only scientific texts that described natural phenomena but also moral and religious guides that connected material objects to divine forces.\nMedieval lapidaries were deeply embedded in the practice of lithotherapy, the belief in the healing properties of stones. John M. Riddle\u2019s analysis of lithotherapy in the Middle Ages emphasizes the medical role lapidaries played, particularly in guiding the use of gemstones for healing. These texts described how different stones, often categorized by color, composition, and astrological associations, could be used to treat specific ailments. Riddle points out that medieval lapidaries were not merely collections of folklore; they were often considered legitimate medical texts, consulted by physicians and healers to guide treatment practices.\nThe \"Peterborough Lapidary\" is another example of a medieval lapidary that reflects the blending of practical and mystical knowledge. As detailed in \"A Medieval Book of Magical Stones: The Peterborough Lapidary\", this text catalogs various gemstones and their magical properties, emphasizing the belief that stones could influence human behavior, protect against harm, and even cure diseases. The \"Peterborough Lapidary\" demonstrates how lapidaries were used not only for healing but also for magical and protective purposes, reflecting the medieval understanding that the natural world was imbued with supernatural power.\nLapidaries also played an important role in medieval spirituality. Richard A. Beinert\u2019s analysis of medieval piety and lapidary literature emphasizes how these texts reflected religious beliefs. Medieval Christians often associated gemstones with biblical figures, virtues, and divine forces. Lapidaries like the \"Peterborough Lapidary\" reinforced the idea that stones had sacred meanings, offering protection and spiritual benefits to those who used them correctly. Beinert suggests that these texts served as \u201cwindows on a medieval world\u201d where natural objects were seen as manifestations of divine power, bridging the gap between the material and the spiritual.\nSeveral notable examples of medieval lapidaries highlight their widespread use and cultural significance. The \"Lapidary of Sydrac\", a 13th-century text, stands out for its inclusion of unusual lore about gemstones. William M. Holler notes that the \"Lapidary of Sydrac\" cataloged not only conventional healing properties of stones but also fantastical claims, such as stones that could grant invincibility or manipulate human emotions. This text reflects the broader medieval belief in the mystical powers of nature and the importance of lapidaries in transmitting both empirical knowledge and magical traditions.\nIn literary contexts, lapidary traditions also made their way into poetry. Tony Davenport\u2019s analysis of the medieval poem \"Pearl\" reveals how the symbolic meanings of gemstones, as described in lapidaries, informed the poem\u2019s themes of loss, beauty, and spiritual transcendence. Davenport suggests that the portrayal of jewels in \"Pearl\" draws on lapidary traditions to convey deeper religious and moral messages, illustrating how lapidary knowledge permeated not only scientific and medical texts but also literary and artistic works.\nTechniques.\nThere are three broad categories of lapidary arts: tumbling, cabochon cutting, and faceting. Among a modern gemcutter's work are the following activities:\nCutting.\nCutting of harder stones is done with a diamond-edged saw. For softer materials, a medium other than diamond can be used, such as silicon carbide, garnet, emery, or corundum. Diamond cutting requires the use of diamond tools because of the extreme hardness of diamonds. The cutting, grinding, and polishing operations are usually lubricated with water, oil, or other liquids. Beyond these broader categories, there are other specialized forms of lapidary techniques, such as casting, carving, jewelry, and mosaics.\nWhile the gemstone in the rough state may be trimmed to remove undesirable material or to separate it on a cleavage line with a diamond bladed saw, accurately described as cutting and once done by the use of a chisel or similar tool to simply break off pieces that were usable as single gemstones, the actual shaping and polishing of a gemstone is a grinding or sanding process. This grinding and sanding is done using a lap, a precision metal plate embedded with grit similar to the more familiar embedding of grit on paper the lap is of high precision particularly for flatness and turned by a motor. The grit material is normally diamond and sometimes corundum for their hardness. Only diamond is hard enough on the Mohs scale to shape and polish a diamond.\nFaceting.\nFaceting requires equipment allowing for very precise adjustment of angle and location around the gemstone for facet-placement, a process sometimes referred to as indexing. \nThe design may be computer-generated or left up to the skill and expertise of the individual cutting the gemstone.\nDuring the process of grinding, faceting, and lapping, the gemstone is usually affixed (\"dopped\") to a rod (frequently referred to as a \"dop\" or \"dopstick\") made of wood, or perhaps brass or steel, \nwith dopping cement, a specialized thermal adhesive. The dopstick can be hand-held or inserted into the indexing equipment for more precise faceting. A coolant then needs to be constantly applied to prevent softening of the cement. Diamonds, however, are held mechanically, or with low-melting point tin-lead solder, since the resultant heat generated by friction can be extreme, thus preventing the use of thermal adhesives.\nCabochons - smooth-shaped gemstones without facets such as jade or turquoise, and indeed most gemstones - are instead shaped and polished in much the same manner. They are usually left up to the skill and expertise of the individual cutting the gemstone and to similar equipment such as the lapping equipment.\nPolishing.\nMost modern lapidary work is done using motorized equipment. Polishing is done with resin- or metal-bonded emery, silicon carbide (carborundum), aluminium oxide (corundum), or diamond dust in successively decreasing particle sizes until a polish is achieved. In older systems, the grinding and polishing powders were applied separately to the grinding or buffing wheel. Often, the final polish will use a different medium such as tin oxide or cerium(IV) oxide.\nThe initial shaping and facet placement may be done using laps with grits of 220, 600, and/or 1200. The polishing step, however, requires grits of a much higher grade, such as 8,000, 14,000, 50,000 and even 100,000. This grit is also embedded into a metal lap, but sometimes applied manually to the lap during polishing.\nInlaying.\nAnother specialized form of lapidary work is the inlaying of marble and gemstones into a marble matrix. This technique is known in English as \"pietra dura\", for the hardstones that are used, like onyx, jasper and carnelian. In Florence and Naples, where the technique was developed in the 16th century, it is called . The Medici Chapel at San Lorenzo in Florence is completely veneered with inlaid hard stones. The specialty of \"micromosaics\", which developed in the late-18th century in Naples and Rome, is sometimes covered under the umbrella term of lapidary work. In this technique, minute slivers of glass are assembled to create still life, cityscape views, and other images. In China, lapidary work specializing in jade carving has been continuous since at least the Shang dynasty.\nSafety.\nStones can contain asbestos, silica, lead, talc, and other hazardous ingredients. The dust produced by lapidary techniques on such stones can cause health issues if inhaled. Copper(II) oxide, which is common in colorful minerals such as turquoise and malachite, can damage the endocrine and central nervous systems. The most common minerals are silicates, and the dust from these rocks can result in silicosis. Fossil rocks can be radioactive.\nFor lapidary work, safety precautions include wearing a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health approved respirator with replaceable cartridges and dust filters; using a local exhaust ventilation system or working outside; using proper lubricants; wearing protective clothing; showering and shampooing immediately afterward; and using a wet mop to clean the workshop.\nSocieties and clubs.\nThere are lapidary clubs throughout the world. In Australia, there are numerous gem shows, including an annual gem show called the GEMBOREE, which is a nationwide lapidary competition. There is a collection of gem and mineral shows held in Tucson, Arizona, at the beginning of February each year. The event began with the Tucson Gem and Mineral Society Show and has now grown to include dozens of other independent shows. In 2012, this concurrent group of shows constituted the largest gem and mineral event in the world.\nIn the United States, societies include the American Gem Society.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was named for Saint Francis Solanus. It was the only mission built in Alta California after Mexico gained independence from Spain. The mission was established in 1823 due to a collaborative effort between California governor Luis Arg\u00fcello and Franciscan friar Jos\u00e9 Altimira. It was closed and converted to a parish in 1834, having been smaller in number of converts and having had lower productivity and diversity of industries than the older California missions.\nThe mission building is now part of the Sonoma State Historic Park and is located in the city of Sonoma, California.\nHistory.\nFr. Altimira.\nFr. Jos\u00e9 Altimira at age 33 arrived from Barcelona, Spain, to serve at Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds. The mission was not thriving because of its climate and had established a medical \"asistencia\" (\"sub-mission\") in San Rafael to help the mission's ill neophytes (baptized Native Americans) recover their health. California Governor Luis Arg\u00fcello was interested in blocking the Russians at Bodega Bay and Fort Ross from moving further inland. Together they developed and presented to the church authorities and the territory (legislature) a plan for moving Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds and the San Rafael \"asistencia\" to a new location north of the Bay. The legislature approved but the church authorities did not respond (they had forwarded the plan to their superiors in Mexico). Under the old Spanish regime, founding a new mission required the approval of both New Spain's Bishop and the King's Viceroy.\nBeginning in 1823, while waiting for a response from the church authorities, Fr. Altimira, with military escorts, began exploring north of the Bay for a suitable mission site. On July 4, 1823, the soldiers placed a large redwood cross on the place in the Sonoma Valley where they expected the new Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds to be established. They celebrated Mass to consecrate the location, then returned south to begin gathering men and materials to begin construction.\nThe area around the selected site was not empty. It was near the northeast corner of the territory of the Coast Miwok, Southern Pomo to the northwest, Wappo to the northeast, Suisunes and Ptwin peoples to the east.&lt;ref name=\"S/PSHPA\"&gt;S/PSHPA&lt;/ref&gt; A detachment of soldiers from the Presidio of San Francisco would be provided to protect the Mission and guard the neophytes.\nAltimira, with soldiers and neophytes primarily from Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, returned to the Sonoma area near the end of August. Altimira decided there was a better place to build on the other side of the valley. Just after starting he received a letter from Father-President Sarria who refused Altimira permission to continue building. Fr. Altimira obeyed and the month of September saw continuing negotiations between California's civil and religious leaders. On September 30 an agreement was reached: a new mission could be built and Fr. Altimira would be its minister, but Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds would not be closed and the San Rafael asistencia had already been designated as a full mission (Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel).\nBeginning in October 1824 Fr. Altimira had the opportunity to build his new mission at the location he chose, but since Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds would remain open this Mission needed a different patron saint. Altimira chose San Francisco Solano, a 17th-century Franciscan missionary to South America. His company of soldiers and neophytes set about building all the facilities needed in a California mission. His annual report for 1823 listed no baptisms, one marriage, one funeral, a population of 482 Indians (all transferred from other missions) and 1341 animals. The work had started too late in the year for anything to be planted and harvested.\nOn April 4, 1825, Passion Sunday, Father Altimira proudly dedicated his church. It was a crude, temporary structure but it symbolized development at the Mission. The church was built of whitewashed boards but was well furnished and decorated. Many of the articles were gifts from the Russians at Fort Ross. It also held a canvas painting of San Francisco Solano which had been donated by the Father-President. Furthermore, the Mission had been promised a relic of the patron saint to put in the altar.\nThe Mission continued to develop until an argument arose about the sharing of the bountiful 1826 harvest. Indians not living at the Mission were unhappy with the amount allocated for their work; they burned some of the wooden buildings in protest. Fr. Altimira with a few faithful neophytes fled to Mission San Rafael Arc\u00e1ngel.\nFr. Fortuni.\nFr. Buenaventura Fortuni, an aging Spanish Franciscan who had been working at Mission San Jos\u00e9 in California, was assigned to replace Altimira. Fr. Fortuni quickly reestablished order and morale and the work of building the mission restarted. He arranged the main buildings to form a large, square enclosure.\nIn 1830 Fr. Fortuni, having labored alone at this mission for three and a half years, felt the need to transfer to another mission where the workload could be shared. He was 58 years old. The Mexican government had in 1826 required that all the Spanish friars who would not pledge loyalty to Mexico leave. Fr. Fortuni had been exempt from this rule but all new churchmen would be required to take the pledge.\nFr. Gutierrez.\nFr. Fortuni was replaced by Fr. Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez, a Franciscan friar from South America. Fr. Gutierrez continued to build and increased the agricultural effort. By 1832 the mission had 27 rooms in the \"convento\" or priest's quarters, with a great adobe church at the east end, and a wooden storehouse (the original mission chapel) at the west end. Completing this enclosure were workshops where the Indians were taught to be craftsmen and created the items needed to help the mission be self-sufficient. Along the back of the courtyard were the living quarters and workrooms for the young Indian girls. In addition to the quadrangle, there were orchards, gardens, vineyards, fields of grain, a gristmill, houses for the soldiers and Indian families, a jail, a cemetery, and an infirmary.\nThe most successful year of this mission's short life span (11 years) was 1832. In his annual report for that year, Fr. Gutierrez recorded the following: 127 baptisms, 34 marriages, and 70 deaths; a total of 996 neophytes (coming from 35 area villages); the livestock inventory included 6,000 sheep and goats, 900 horses, 13 mules, 50 pigs and 3,500 head of cattle. Crops were measured in fanegas, or Spanish bushels, a variable measure of volume generally between 50 and 60 liters. In 1832 the mission produced 800 fanegas of wheat, 1025 fanegas of barley, 52 fanegas of peas, 300 fanegas of corn, 32 fanegas of beans, and 2 fanegas of garbanzos.\nSecularization.\nIn 1833 the Mexican Congress decided to close all of the missions in Alta California with the passage of the Mexican secularization act of 1833. Governor Figueroa issued a regulation (\"Reglamento Provisional para la secularization de las Misiones\") on August 9, 1834, outlining the requirements for the distribution of property (land, cattle, and equipment) to each mission's neophytes. Among the provisions were that \"5. To each head of a family and to all over 20 years old, will be given from the Mission lands a lot not over 400 nor less than 100 \"varas\" square\" (28 to 7 acres). Plus \"6. ...\"pro rata\"...one-half of the livestock\" and \"7. ... half or less of the existing chattels, tools, and seed...\".\nClosure.\nMission San Francisco Solano officially ceased to exist on November 3, 1834, when it was designated a First Class Parish. The Spanish missionaries were to be replaced by parish priests, the first of whom was Fr. Lorenzo Quijas who had earlier been assigned to Sonoma and San Rafael.\nLieutenant (\"teniente\") Mariano Vallejo, Commandant of the Presidio of San Francisco, was named administrator (\"comisionado\") to oversee the closing of the Mission under the \"Reglamento\". Fr. Quijas moved back to San Rafael in July 1835, after many disputes with Guadalupe Antonio Ortega, Vallejo's majordomo to whom he had delegated the work of secularization. Ortega (sometimes called Sergeant Ortega) was \u201cuneducated, coarse and licentious\". Right after returning to San Rafael, Padre Quijas wrote a letter to Commissary Perfect Garcia Diego, his superior, complaining about the situation in Sonoma and specifically the \"abominable deeds of Ortega.\" Quijas then gives names of witnesses to be called against Ortega. Upon receipt of the letter, Fr. Diego forwarded it to Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa demanding some action against Ortega. The Governor was critically ill and died at the end of the following month. No action was taken. It wasn't until the summer of 1837, because of new scandals and unsatisfactory accounts, that Ortega was removed.\nAfter Fr. Quijas left, the neophyte population decreased rapidly, most returning to their home villages \u2013 taking their movable property with them \u2013 or moving to ranchos {including Vallejo's Petaluma Adobe} to work, or staying in Sonoma as servants. Some former Mission Indians reportedly received their allotted land and cattle from the Mission (none of these small plots of land were permanently recorded.) In August 1839, the government sent William Edward Petty Hartnell as \"Visitador General de Misiones\" to check compliance with the \"Reglamento\" but Vallejo avoided responding \u2013 claiming he did not have time because of military affairs. No effective review of the secularization of the Sonoma mission was ever completed.\nDecline.\nThe mission buildings rapidly fell into disrepair. The town of Sonoma was growing and building materials were in great demand. Roof tiles, timbers, and adobe bricks were salvaged from the mission buildings. After the settlers had ransacked the old buildings, nature began recycling the remnants.\nIn 1841, Mariano Vallejo ordered a small adobe chapel to be built on the location of the first wooden mission chapel. It became the church of the parish and replaced the large mission church which was rapidly deteriorating. It stood on the west end of the \"Convento\" and so is often thought to be the church of the old mission.\nDuring 1863 President Abraham Lincoln transferred ownership of all the mission churches in California to the Roman Catholic Church. In 1881, the Sonoma church property was sold to a local businessman and a new parish church was built across town. At one time, the old adobe chapel was used as a warehouse. The \"Convento\" may have been used as a winery.\nReconstruction, memorial and hospital.\nIn 1903, the two remaining mission buildings were purchased by California Historic Landmarks League, and became part of the California Park System in 1906. In 1903, the Sonoma Valley Woman's Club raised $184 () to help preserve the Sonoma Mission as a city landmark. In 1910, Club members got a lease on the property and raised $800 () for repairs. They were assisted by the Native Sons of the Golden West of Sonoma. In 1911, club members petitioned the State Legislature, resulting in a appropriation of $5,000 () to restore the Mission. By 1913, both had been reconstructed. After the 1940s, the former church and \"Convento\" were remodeled along more authentic lines suited to exhibits devoted exclusively to mission history.\nDedicated in 1999, the Sonoma Mission Indian Memorial honors the more than 800 native people (including over 200 children) who died while living and working at the Mission between 1824 and 1839. Their Christian names, as recorded by the priests in the Mission's records, are inscribed on this granite memorial. European diseases such as measles and smallpox, for which Native Americans had no inherited resistance, together with the overcrowded and unhealthy living conditions at all California missions (especially for women and children) contributed to the high death rate. However, the missions served, with the resources of the time, the health needs of its inhabitants, including those of Indian origin. Thus, the first hospital in California was founded in 1817 to care for the Indians of the Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds, in what later became an independent Mission, the Mission San Rafael Arcangel, in San Rafael, California.\nCalifornia Historic Landmark.\nOn June 1, 1932, Mission San Francisco Solano was designated California Historical Landmark #3.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Use of the word has broadened to include products such as automobiles.\nVaporware is often announced months or years before its purported release, with few details about its development being released. Developers have been accused of intentionally promoting vaporware to keep customers from switching to competing products that offer more features. \"Network World\" magazine called vaporware an \"epidemic\" in 1989 and blamed the press for not investigating if developers' claims were true. Seven major companies issued a report in 1990 saying that they felt vaporware had hurt the industry's credibility. The United States accused several companies of announcing vaporware early enough to violate antitrust laws, but few have been found guilty.\n\"Vaporware\" was coined by a Microsoft engineer in 1982 to describe the company's Xenix operating system and appeared in print at least as early as the May 1983 issue of Sinclair User magazine (spelled 'Vapourware' in UK English). It became popular among writers in the industry as a way to describe products they felt took too long to be released. \"InfoWorld\" magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize it by lampooning Bill Gates with a \"Golden Vaporware\" award for the late release of his company's first version of Windows in 1985.\nEtymology.\n\"Vaporware\", sometimes synonymous with \"vaportalk\" in the 1980s, has no single definition. It is generally used to describe a hardware or software product that has been announced, but that the developer is unlikely to release any time soon, if ever.\nThe first reported use of the word was in 1982 by an engineer at the computer software company Microsoft. Ann Winblad, president of Open Systems Accounting Software, wanted to know if Microsoft planned to stop developing its Xenix operating system as some of Open System's products depended on it. She asked two Microsoft software engineers, John Ulett and Mark Ursino, who confirmed that development of Xenix had stopped. \"One of them told me, 'Basically, it's vaporware',\" she later said. Winblad compared the word to the idea of \"selling smoke\", implying Microsoft was selling a product it would soon not support.\nWinblad described the word to influential computer expert Esther Dyson, who published it for the first time in her monthly newsletter \"RELease 1.0\". In an article titled \"Vaporware\" in the November 1983 issue of \"RELease 1.0\", Dyson defined the word as \"good ideas incompletely implemented\". She described three software products shown at COMDEX in Las Vegas that year with bombastic advertisements. She stated that demonstrations of the \"purported revolutions, breakthroughs and new generations\" at the exhibition did not meet those claims.\nThe practice existed before Winblad's account. In a January 1982 review of the new IBM Personal Computer, \"BYTE\" favorably noted that IBM \"refused to acknowledge the existence of any product that is not ready to be put on dealers' shelves tomorrow. Although this is frustrating at times, it is a refreshing change from some companies' practice of announcing a product even before its design is finished\". When discussing Coleco's delay in releasing the Adam, \"Creative Computing\" in March 1984 stated that the company \"did not invent the common practice of debuting products before they actually exist. In microcomputers, to do so otherwise would be to break with a veritable tradition\". Recalling that a Lanier Business Products word processor became available immediately after its announcement, \"Creative Computing\" wrote that year, \"If we were to re-enact that scene today, I wouldn't get my machine for at least six months, maybe a year\".\nAfter Dyson's article, the word \"vaporware\" became popular among writers in the personal computer software industry as a way to describe products they believed took too long to be released after their first announcement. \"InfoWorld\" magazine editor Stewart Alsop helped popularize its use by giving Bill Gates, then-CEO of Microsoft, with a \"Golden Vaporware\" award for Microsoft releasing Windows in 1985, 18 months late. Alsop presented it to Gates at a celebration for the release while the song \"The Impossible Dream\" played in the background.\n\"Vaporware\" took another meaning when it was used to describe a product that did not exist. A new company named Ovation Technologies announced its office suite Ovation in 1983. The company invested in an advertising campaign that promoted Ovation as a \"great innovation\", and showed a demonstration of the program at computer trade shows. The demonstration was well received by writers in the press, was featured in a cover story for an industry magazine, and reportedly created anticipation among potential customers. Executives later revealed that Ovation never existed. The company created the fake demonstration in an unsuccessful attempt to raise money to finish their product, and is \"widely considered the mother of all vaporware,\" according to Laurie Flynn of \"The New York Times\".\nUse of the term spread beyond the computer industry. \"Newsweek\" magazine's Allan Sloan described the manipulation of stocks by Yahoo! and Amazon.com as \"financial vaporware\" in 1997. \"Popular Science\" magazine uses a scale ranging from \"vaporware\" to \"bet on it\" to describe release dates of new consumer electronics. Car manufacturer General Motors' plans to develop and sell an electric car were called vaporware by an advocacy group in 2008 and \"Car and Driver\" magazine retroactively described the Vector W8 supercar as vaporware in 2017.\nCauses and use.\nLate release.\nA product missing its announced release date, and the labeling of it as vaporware by the press, can be caused by its development taking longer than planned. Most software products are not released on time, according to researchers in 2001 who studied the causes and effects of vaporware; \"I hate to say yes, but yes\", a Microsoft product manager stated in 1984, adding that \"the problem isn't just at Microsoft\". The phenomenon is so common that Lotus' release of 1-2-3 on time in January 1983, three months after announcing it, amazed many. When Lotus Notes appeared in 1989, the company said \"Notes is coming off the vaporware list\".\nSoftware development is a complex process, and developers are often uncertain how long it will take to complete any given project. Fixing errors in software, for example, can make up a significant portion of its development time, and developers are motivated not to release software with errors because it could damage their reputation with customers. Last-minute design changes are also common. Large organizations seem to have more late projects than smaller ones, and may benefit from hiring individual programmers on contract to write software rather than using in-house development teams. Adding people to a late software project does not help; according to Brooks' Law, doing so increases the delay.\nNot all delays in software are the developers' fault. In 1986, the American National Standards Institute adopted SQL as the standard database manipulation language. Software company Ashton-Tate was ready to release dBase IV, but pushed the release date back to add support for SQL. The company believed that the product would not be competitive without it. As the word became more commonly used by writers in the mid-1980s, \"InfoWorld\" magazine editor James Fawcette wrote that its negative connotations were unfair to developers because of these types of circumstances.\nDuke Nukem.\nVaporware also includes announced products that are never released because of financial problems, or because the industry changes during its development. When 3D Realms first announced \"Duke Nukem Forever\" in 1997, the video game was early in its development. The company's previous game released in 1996, \"Duke Nukem 3D\", was a critical and financial success, and customer anticipation for its sequel was high. As personal computer hardware speeds improved at a rapid pace in the late 1990s, it created an \"arms race\" between companies in the video game industry, according to \"Wired News\". 3D Realms repeatedly moved the release date back over the next 12 years to add new, more advanced features. By the time 3D Realms went out of business in 2009 with the game still unreleased, \"Duke Nukem Forever\" had become synonymous with the word \"vaporware\" among industry writers. The game was revived and released in 2011. However, due to a 13-year period of fan anticipation and design changes in the industry, the game received a mostly negative reception from critics and fans.\nA company notorious for vaporware can improve its reputation. In the 1980s, video game maker Westwood Studios was known for shipping products late. However, by 1993, it had so improved that \"Computer Gaming World\" reported \"many publishers would assure [us] that a project was going to be completed on time \"because\" Westwood was doing it\".\nEarly announcement.\nAnnouncing products early\u2014months or years before their release date, also called \"preannouncing\", has been an effective way by some developers to make their products successful. It can be seen as a legitimate part of their marketing strategy, but is generally not popular with industry press. The first company to release a product in a given market often gains an advantage. It can set the standard for similar future products, attract a large number of customers, and establish its brand before competitor's products are released. Public relations firm Coakley-Heagerty used an early announcement in 1984 to build interest among potential customers. Its client was Nolan Bushnell, formerly of Atari Inc. who wanted to promote the new Sente Technologies, but his contract with Atari prohibited doing so until a later date. The firm created an advertising campaign\u2014including brochures and a shopping-mall appearance\u2014around a large ambiguous box covered in brown paper to increase curiosity until Sente could be announced.\nEarly announcements send signals not only to customers and the media, but also to providers of support products, regulatory agencies, financial analysts, investors, and other parties. For example, an early announcement can relay information to vendors, letting them know to prepare marketing and shelf space. It can signal third-party developers to begin work on their own products, and it can be used to persuade a company's investors that they are actively developing new, profitable ideas. Microsoft described this in 1995, during \"United States v. Microsoft\", as \"not in fact vaporware, but pre-disclosure\" if not done with \"a desire to mislead\". When IBM announced its Professional Workstation computer in 1986, they noted the lack of third-party programs written for it at the time, signaling those developers to start preparing. Microsoft usually announces information about its operating systems early because third-party developers are dependent on that information to develop their own products. Gates said in 1987 that while his company did not preannounce applications, \"In the case of systems software, I think you've got to make statements of direction ... We really bring people in and go into it in great detail\". Alsop proposed in 1995 that instead of early public announcements, companies should, using nondisclosure agreements, privately notify important customers.\nA developer can strategically announce a product that is in the early stages of development, or before development begins, to gain competitive advantage over other developers. In addition to the \"vaporware\" label, this is also called \"ambush marketing\", and \"fear, uncertainty and doubt\" (FUD) by the press. If the announcing developer is a large company, this may be done to influence smaller companies to stop development of similar products. The smaller company might decide their product will not be able to compete, and that it is not worth the development costs. It can also be done in response to a competitor's already-released product. The goal is to make potential customers believe a second, better product will be released soon. The customer might reconsider buying from the competitor, and wait. In 1994, as customer anticipation increased for Microsoft's new version of Windows (codenamed \"Chicago\"), Apple announced a set of upgrades to its own System 7 operating system that were not due to be released until nearly two years later. \"The Wall Street Journal\" wrote that Apple did this to \"blunt Chicago's momentum\".\nA premature announcement can cause others to respond with their own. When VisiCorp announced Visi On in November 1982, it promised to ship the product by spring 1983. The news forced Quarterdeck Office Systems to announce in April 1983 that its DESQ would ship in November 1983. Microsoft responded by announcing Windows 1.0 in fall 1983, and Ovation Technologies followed by announcing Ovation in November. \"InfoWorld\" noted in May 1984 that of the four products only Visi On had shipped, albeit more than a year late and with only two supported applications.\nIndustry publications widely accused companies of using early announcements intentionally to gain competitive advantage over others. In his 1989 \"Network World\" article, Joe Mohen wrote the practice had become a \"vaporware epidemic\", and blamed the press for not investigating claims by developers. \"If the pharmaceutical industry were this careless, I could announce a cure for cancer today \u2013 to a believing press.\" In 1985 Stewart Alsop began publishing his influential monthly \"Vaporlist\", a list of companies he felt announced their products too early, hoping to dissuade them from the practice; among the entries in January 1988 were a Verbatim Corp. optical drive that was 30 months late, WordPerfect for Macintosh (12 months), IBM OS/2 1.1 (nine months), and Lotus 1-2-3 for OS/2 and Macintosh (nine and three months late, respectively). \"Wired\" Magazine began publishing a similar list in 1997. Seven major software developers\u2014including Ashton-Tate, Hewlett-Packard, and Sybase\u2014formed a council in 1990, and issued a report condemning the \"vacuous product announcement dubbed vaporware and other misrepresentations of product availability\" because they felt it had hurt the industry's credibility.\nAntitrust allegations.\nIn the United States, announcing a product that does not exist to gain a competitive advantage is illegal via Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, but few hardware or software developers have been found guilty of it. The section requires proof that the announcement is both provably false, and has actual or likely market impact.\nFalse or misleading announcements designed to influence stock prices are illegal under United States securities fraud laws. The complex and changing nature of the computer industry, marketing techniques, and lack of precedent for applying these laws to the industry can mean developers are not aware their actions are illegal. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued a statement in 1984 with the goal of reminding companies that securities fraud also applies to \"statements that can reasonably be expected to reach investors and the trading markets\".\nSeveral companies have been accused in court of using knowingly false announcements to gain market advantage. In 1969, the United States Justice Department accused IBM of doing this in the case \"\". After IBM's competitor, Control Data Corporation (CDC), released a computer, IBM announced the System/360 Model 91. The announcement resulted in a significant reduction in sales of CDC's product. The Justice Department accused IBM of doing this intentionally because the System/360 Model 91 was not released until two years later. IBM avoided preannouncing products during the antitrust case, but after the case ended it resumed the practice. The company likely announced its PCjr in November 1983\u2014four months before general availability in March 1984\u2014to hurt sales of rival home computers during the important Christmas sales season. In 1985 \"The New York Times\" wrote\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Because of its position in the industry, an announcement of a future I.B.M. product, or even a rumor of one, is enough to slow competitors' sales. Some critics say that I.B.M. is trying to lock out competitors when it issues statements outlining the general trend of future products. I.B.M. insists the practice is necessary to help customer planning.\nThe practice was not called \"vaporware\" at the time, but publications have since used the word to refer specifically to it. Similar cases have been filed against Kodak, AT&amp;T, and Xerox.\nUS District Judge Stanley Sporkin was a vocal opponent of the practice during his review of the settlement resulting from \"United States v. Microsoft Corp.\" in 1994. \"Vaporware is a practice that is deceitful on its face and everybody in the business community knows it,\" said Sporkin. One of the accusations made during the trial was that Microsoft has illegally used early announcements. The review began when three anonymous companies protested the settlement, claiming the government did not thoroughly investigate Microsoft's use of the practice. Specifically, they claimed Microsoft announced its Quick Basic 3 program to slow sales of its competitor Borland's recently released Turbo Basic program. The review was dismissed for lack of explicit proof.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n\"Wired\" Magazine Vaporware Awards.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "60088", "revid": "11104410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60088", "title": "Roentgenium", "text": "element with atomic number 111 (Rg)\nRoentgenium () is a synthetic chemical element; it has symbol Rg and atomic number 111. It is extremely radioactive and can only be created in a laboratory. The most stable known isotope, roentgenium-282, has a half-life of 130 seconds, although the unconfirmed roentgenium-286 may have a longer half-life of about 10.7\u00a0minutes. Roentgenium was first created in December 1994 by the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research near Darmstadt, Germany. It is named after the physicist Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen (also spelled Roentgen), who discovered X-rays. Only a few roentgenium atoms have ever been synthesized, and they have no practical application.\nIn the periodic table, it is a d-block transactinide element. It is a member of the 7th period and is placed in the group 11 elements, although no chemical experiments have been carried out to confirm that it behaves as the heavier homologue to gold in group 11 as the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Roentgenium is calculated to have similar properties to its lighter homologues, copper, silver, and gold, although it may show some differences from them.\nHistory.\nOfficial discovery.\nRoentgenium was first synthesized by an international team led by Sigurd Hofmann at the Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, on December 8, 1994. The team bombarded a target of bismuth-209 with accelerated nuclei of nickel-64 and detected three nuclei of the isotope 272111:\n[&lt;noinclude /&gt;[bismuth-209|Bi]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] + [&lt;noinclude /&gt;[nickel-64|Ni]&lt;noinclude /&gt;] \u2192 272111 + \nThis reaction had previously been conducted at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna (then in the Soviet Union) in 1986, but no atoms of 272111 had then been observed. In 2001, the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party (JWP) concluded that there was insufficient evidence for the discovery at that time. The GSI team repeated their experiment in 2002 and detected three more atoms. In their 2003 report, the JWP decided that the GSI team should be acknowledged for the discovery of this element.\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, roentgenium should be known as \"eka-gold\". In 1979, IUPAC published recommendations according to which the element was to be called \"unununium\" (with the corresponding symbol of \"Uuu\"), a systematic element name as a placeholder, until the element was discovered (and the discovery then confirmed) and a permanent name was decided on. Although widely used in the chemical community on all levels, from chemistry classrooms to advanced textbooks, the recommendations were mostly ignored among scientists in the field, who called it \"element 111\", with the symbol of \"E111\", \"(111)\" or even simply \"111\".\nThe name \"roentgenium\" (Rg) was suggested by the GSI team in 2004, to honor the German physicist Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen, the discoverer of X-rays. This name was accepted by IUPAC on November 1, 2004.\nIsotopes.\nRoentgenium has no stable or naturally occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusion of the nuclei of lighter elements or as intermediate decay products of heavier elements. Nine different isotopes of roentgenium have been reported with atomic masses 272, 274, 278\u2013283, and 286 (283 and 286 unconfirmed), two of which, roentgenium-272 and roentgenium-274, have known but unconfirmed metastable states. All of these decay through alpha decay or spontaneous fission, though 280Rg may also have an electron capture branch.\nStability and half-lives.\nAll roentgenium isotopes are extremely unstable and radioactive; in general, the heavier isotopes are more stable than the lighter. The most stable known roentgenium isotope, 282Rg, is also the heaviest known roentgenium isotope; it has a half-life of 100\u00a0seconds. The unconfirmed 286Rg is even heavier and appears to have an even longer half-life of about 10.7\u00a0minutes, which would make it one of the longest-lived superheavy nuclides known; likewise, the unconfirmed 283Rg appears to have a long half-life of about 5.1\u00a0minutes. The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg have also been reported to have half-lives over a second. The remaining isotopes have half-lives in the millisecond range.\nThe missing isotopes between 274Rg and 278Rg are too light to be produced by hot fusion and too heavy to be produced by cold fusion. A possible synthesis method is to populate them from above, as daughters of nihonium or moscovium isotopes that can be produced by hot fusion. The isotopes 283Rg and 284Rg could be synthesised using charged-particle evaporation, using the 238U+48Ca reaction where a proton is evaporated alongside some neutrons.\nPredicted properties.\nOther than nuclear properties, no properties of roentgenium or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that roentgenium (and its parents) decays very quickly. Properties of roentgenium metal remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nChemical.\nRoentgenium is the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold, thus implying that roentgenium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements, copper, silver, and gold; however, it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues.\nRoentgenium is predicted to be a noble metal. The standard electrode potential of 1.9\u00a0V for the Rg3+/Rg couple is greater than that of 1.5\u00a0V for the Au3+/Au couple. Roentgenium's predicted first ionisation energy of 1020\u00a0kJ/mol almost matches that of the noble gas radon at 1037\u00a0kJ/mol. Its predicted second ionization energy, 2070\u00a0kJ/mol, is almost the same as that of silver. Based on the most stable oxidation states of the lighter group 11 elements, roentgenium is predicted to show stable +5 and +3 oxidation states, with a less stable +1 state. The +3 state is predicted to be the most stable. Roentgenium(III) is expected to be of comparable reactivity to gold(III), but should be more stable and form a larger variety of compounds. Gold also forms a somewhat stable \u22121 state due to relativistic effects, and it has been suggested roentgenium may do so as well: nevertheless, the electron affinity of roentgenium is expected to be around , significantly lower than gold's value of , so roentgenides may not be stable or even possible.\nThe 6d orbitals are destabilized by relativistic effects and spin\u2013orbit interactions near the end of the fourth transition metal series, thus making the high oxidation state roentgenium(V) more stable than its lighter homologue gold(V) (known only in gold pentafluoride, Au2F10) as the 6d electrons participate in bonding to a greater extent. The spin-orbit interactions stabilize molecular roentgenium compounds with more bonding 6d electrons; for example, RgF6- is expected to be more stable than RgF4-, which is expected to be more stable than RgF2-. The stability of RgF6- is homologous to that of AuF6-; the silver analogue AgF6- is unknown and is expected to be only marginally stable to decomposition to AgF4- and F2. Moreover, Rg2F10 is expected to be stable to decomposition, exactly analogous to the Au2F10, whereas Ag2F10 should be unstable to decomposition to Ag2F6 and F2. Gold heptafluoride, AuF7, is known as a gold(V) difluorine complex AuF5\u00b7F2, which is lower in energy than a true gold(VII) heptafluoride would be; RgF7 is instead calculated to be more stable as a true roentgenium(VII) heptafluoride, although it would be somewhat unstable, its decomposition to Rg2F10 and F2 releasing a small amount of energy at room temperature. Roentgenium(I) is expected to be difficult to obtain. Gold readily forms the cyanide complex Au(CN)2-, which is used in its extraction from ore through the process of gold cyanidation; roentgenium is expected to follow suit and form Rg(CN)2-.\nThe probable chemistry of roentgenium has received more interest than that of the two previous elements, meitnerium and darmstadtium, as the valence s-subshells of the group 11 elements are expected to be relativistically contracted most strongly at roentgenium. Calculations on the molecular compound RgH show that relativistic effects double the strength of the roentgenium\u2013hydrogen bond, even though spin\u2013orbit interactions also weaken it by . The compounds AuX and RgX, where X = F, Cl, Br, O, Au, or Rg, were also studied. Rg+ is predicted to be the softest metal ion, even softer than Au+, although there is disagreement on whether it would behave as an acid or a base. In aqueous solution, Rg+ would form the aqua ion [Rg(H2O)2]+, with an Rg\u2013O bond distance of 207.1\u00a0pm. It is also expected to form Rg(I) complexes with ammonia, phosphine, and hydrogen sulfide.\nPhysical and atomic.\nRoentgenium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 22\u201324\u00a0g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61\u00a0g/cm3. The atomic radius of roentgenium is expected to be around 114\u00a0pm.\nExperimental chemistry.\nUnambiguous determination of the chemical characteristics of roentgenium has yet to have been established due to the low yields of reactions that produce roentgenium isotopes. For chemical studies to be carried out on a transactinide, at least four atoms must be produced, the half-life of the isotope used must be at least 1\u00a0second, and the rate of production must be at least one atom per week. Even though the half-life of 282Rg, the most stable confirmed roentgenium isotope, is 100\u00a0seconds, long enough to perform chemical studies, another obstacle is the need to increase the rate of production of roentgenium isotopes and allow experiments to carry on for weeks or months so that statistically significant results can be obtained. Separation and detection must be carried out continuously to separate out the roentgenium isotopes and allow automated systems to experiment on the gas-phase and solution chemistry of roentgenium, as the yields for heavier elements are predicted to be smaller than those for lighter elements. However, the experimental chemistry of roentgenium has not received as much attention as that of the heavier elements from copernicium to livermorium, despite early interest in theoretical predictions due to relativistic effects on the \"n\"s subshell in group 11 reaching a maximum at roentgenium. The isotopes 280Rg and 281Rg are promising for chemical experimentation and may be produced as the granddaughters of the moscovium isotopes 288Mc and 289Mc respectively; their parents are the nihonium isotopes 284Nh and 285Nh, which have already received preliminary chemical investigations.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
