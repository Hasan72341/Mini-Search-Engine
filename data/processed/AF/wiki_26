It is located in eastern Mara Region and northeastern Simiyu Region and contains over of virgin savanna. The park was established in 1940.\nThe Serengeti is well known for the largest annual animal migration in the world of over 1.5\u00a0million western white-bearded wildebeest and 250,000 Grant's zebra, along with between 400-500,000 Thomson's gazelle and smaller herds of common eland. The national park is also home to the largest lion population in Africa. It is under threat from deforestation, population growth, poaching, and ranching.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Serengeti\" is often attributed to a Maasai word \"siringet\", meaning \"the place where the land runs on forever\" or \"endless plains\". However, this word does not appear in dictionaries of the language. \nHistory.\nIn 1930, an area of was designated as a game reserve in southern and eastern Serengeti. In the 1930s, the government of Tanganyika established a system of national parks compliant with the Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State.\nIn 1930, Major Richard Hingdston, visiting Tanganyika on a mission from the Society for the Preservation of the Fauna of the Empire (SPFE), proposed that the Serengeti Game Reserve be designated as a national park to ensure its protection from the pressures of population growth and economic development.\nThe area became a national park in 1940. It was granted strict protection in 1948 when the Serengeti National Park Board of Trustees was formed to administer the national park. The government restricted the movements of the resident Maasai people, and the park boundaries were finalized in 1951. In 1959, an area of was split off in the eastern part of the national park and re-established as Ngorongoro Conservation Area intended to accommodate the traditional land use interests of the Maasai people in a multiple land use area. \nIn 1966 Serengeti Research Institute at Seronera was established to monitor and research the Great Migration. \nIn 1981, the Serengeti National Park covered , which was less than half of the Serengeti.\nThe Serengeti gained fame after Bernhard Grzimek and his son Michael produced a book and documentary titled \"Serengeti Shall Not Die\" in 1959.\nWildlife.\nSerengeti National Park forms a Lion Conservation Unit since 2005 together with Maasai Mara National Reserve.\nMore than 3,000 lions live in this ecosystem. In 1994, an outbreak of canine distemper led to the deaths of approximately one-third of the lion population in the area. \nThe population density of the African leopard is estimated at 5.41 individuals per 100 km2 (14.0 per 100 sq miles) in the dry season.\nAfrican bush elephant herds recovered from a population low in the 1980s caused by poaching, and numbered over 5,000 individuals by 2014. The African buffalo population declined between 1976 and 1996 due to poaching, but increased to 28,524 individuals by 2008. The Eastern black rhinoceros population was reduced to about 10 individuals in the 1980s due to poaching, and fewer than 70 individuals survive in the park today. Rhinos mostly browse on grasses, woody \"Indigofera\", \"Acacia\" and \"Crotalaria\" forbs and shrubs. An estimated 3,520 Masai giraffes lived in the park in 2010, down from 10,750 in 1977. The giraffe population stabilized in the center of the protected area since 2010, but continued to decline in edge areas.\nOther mammal carnivores include the cheetah, about 3,500 spotted hyena, black-backed jackal, East African golden wolf, honey badger, striped hyena, caracal, serval, banded mongoose, and two species of otters. The African wild dog was returned to the area in 2012 after disappearing in 1991. Other mammals include hippopotamus, common warthog, aardvark, aardwolf, African wildcat, African civet, common genet, zorilla, African striped weasel, bat-eared fox, ground pangolin, crested porcupine, three species of hyraxes and Cape hare. Primates such as yellow and olive baboons, vervet monkey, and mantled guereza are also seen in the gallery forests of the Grumeti River.\nReptiles include Nile crocodile, leopard tortoise, serrated hinged terrapin, rainbow agama, Nile monitor, Jackson's chameleon, African python, black mamba, black-necked spitting cobra, and puff adder.\nMore than 500 bird species can be seen such as Masai ostrich, secretarybird, kori bustards, helmeted guineafowls, grey-breasted spurfowl, blacksmith lapwing, African collared dove, red-billed buffalo weaver, southern ground hornbill, crowned cranes, sacred ibis, cattle egrets, black herons, knob-billed ducks, saddle-billed storks, white stork, goliath herons, marabou storks, yellow-billed stork, spotted thick-knees, lesser flamingo, shoebills, abdim's stork, hamerkops, hadada ibis, african fish eagles, pink-backed pelicans, tanzanian red-billed hornbill, martial eagles, egyptian geese, lovebirds, spur-winged geese, oxpeckers, and many species of vultures.\nGreat migration.\nThe great migration is the world's second longest overland migration. The complete migration route is around . South of this migration route covers the Ngorongoro Conservation Area where around half a million wildebeest are born between January and March. By March, at the beginning of the dry season, roughly 1.5 million wildebeest and 250,000 zebras start to migrate north towards Maasai Mara in Kenya. Common eland, plains zebra, and Thomson's gazelle join the wildebeest. In April and May, the migrating herds pass through the Western Corridor. To get to the Maasai Mara, the herds have to cross the Grumeti and Mara Rivers, where around 3,000 crocodiles lie in wait. For every wildebeest captured by the crocodiles, 50 drown. When the dry season ends in late October, the migrating herds start to head back south. Around 250,000 wildebeests and 30,000 plains zebras die annually from drowning, predation, exhaustion, thirst, or disease.\nGeology.\nThe basement complex consists of Archaen Nyanzian System greenstones (2.81\u20132.63 Ga in age), Archaean granite-gneiss plutons (2.72\u20132.56 Ga in age), which were uplifted 180 Ma ago, forming koppies and elongated hills, the Neoproterozoic Mozambique Belt consisting of quartzite and granite, and the Neoproterozoic Ikorongo Group, consisting of sandstone, shale and siltstone that form linear ridges. The southeast portion of the park contains Neogene-aged volcanic rock and Oldoinyo Lengai Holocene-aged volcanic ash. The Grumeti, Mara, Mbalageti, and Orangi rivers flow westward to Lake Victoria, while the Oldupai River flows eastward into the Olbalbal Swamps.\nIn the eastern portion of the park lie the Serengeti volcanic grasslands which are a Tropical Grassland Ecozone. The grasslands grow on deposits of volcanic ash from the Kerimasi Volcano, which erupted 150,000 years ago, and also from the Ol Doinyo Lengai volcanic eruptions, which created layers of calcareous tuff and calcitic hard-pan soil (vertisols) from rapid weathering of the natrocarbonatite lava produced by the volcanoes.\nGeography.\nThe park covers of grassland plains, savanna, riverine forest, and woodlands. The park lies in northwestern Tanzania, bordered to the north by the Kenyan border, where it is continuous with the Maasai Mara National Reserve. To the southeast of the park is the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, to the southwest lies Maswa Game Reserve, to the west are the Ikorongo and Grumeti Game Reserves, and to the northeast and east lies the Loliondo Game Control Area.\nThe landscape of the Serengeti Plain is extremely varied, ranging from savannah to hilly woodlands to open grasslands. The region's geographic diversity is due to the extreme weather conditions that plague the area, particularly the potent combination of heat and wind. The diverse habitats in the region may have originated from a series of volcanoes, whose activity shaped the basic geographic features of the plain by adding mountains and craters to the landscape.\nThe Mara River, which flows through Maasai Mara National Reserve from the Kenyan highlands to Lake Victoria, is the only permanently-flowing river in the Serengeti ecosystem.\nThe park is divided into three regions:\nHuman habitation is forbidden in the park except for the Tanzania National Parks Authority staff, researchers and staff of the various lodges, campsites, and hotels. The main settlement is Seronera with its primary Seronera airstrip.\nAdministration and protection.\nThe park is listed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as a World Heritage Site. It is designated as a Category II protected area under the system developed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which means that it should be managed to protect the ecosystem or ecological processes.\nThe administrative body for all parks in Tanzania is the Tanzania National Parks Authority. Myles Turner was one of the park's first game wardens and is credited with bringing its rampant poaching under control.\nThreats.\nDeforestation in the Mau Forest region has changed the hydrology of the Mara River. There are invasive species of plants such as Siam weed, Prickly pear, Feverfew and Mexican sunflower. A study in 1996 estimated that the human population of the western side of the park is growing by four percent yearly. Livestock use is also growing which increased the amount of land turned over to farming and ranching. A study by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre in 2001 estimated that roughly 200,000 animals are killed by poaching every year.\nBetween 2005 and 2012 the government considered building a 452-km highway through the park, a proposal revived in 2024. The idea sparked significant controversy. Advocates argued that the road would improve connectivity and alleviate poverty in northern Tanzania, while conservationists warn of severe ecological impacts, including disruption of the wildebeest migration and potential ecosystem collapse. Alternatives, such as southern routes bypassing the park, have been proposed as less harmful options that could benefit more people while preserving the park's integrity.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The genus name \"Emberiza\" is from Alemannic German , a bunting. The specific name \"hortulana\" is from the Italian name for this bird, . The English \"ortolan\" is derived from Middle French , \"gardener\".\nThe ortolan is served in French cuisine, typically cooked and eaten whole. Traditionally, diners cover their heads with their napkin or a towel while eating the delicacy. The bird is so widely eaten that its French populations dropped dangerously low, leading to laws restricting its use in 1999. In September 2007, the French government announced its intent to enforce long-ignored laws protecting the bird.\nTaxonomy.\nThe ortolan bunting was described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\" and retains its original binomial name of \"Emberiza hortulana\". The species is monotypic. A molecular phylogenetic study of the buntings published in 2008 found that the ortolan bunting is most closely related to Cretzschmar's bunting (\"Emberiza caesia\").\nDescription.\nThe ortolan bunting is in length and has a wing-span of . In appearance and habits it much resembles its relative the yellowhammer, but lacks the bright colouring of that species; the ortolan's head, for instance, is greenish-grey, instead of a bright yellow. The song of the male ortolan resembles that of the yellowhammer.\nDistribution and habitat.\nA native of most European countries and West Asia, it reaches as far north as Scandinavia and beyond the Arctic Circle, frequenting cornfields and their neighbourhoods. It is an uncommon vagrant in spring, and particularly autumn, to the British Isles. Sightings in the UK are less common than they were, owing to the species' population decline due to overexploitation in France.\nIt was spotted at Kenjar Coastal Karnataka, India, in November 2018 and photographed by birdwatchers. Some birders commented that it is the first photographic record of an ortolan bunting in India.\nBehaviour.\nOrtolan nests are placed on or near the ground.\nThe maximum age recorded is six years and ten months for a bird found dead in Switzerland.\nSeeds are the natural diet, but beetles and other insects are taken when feeding their young.\nCulinary use.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFor centuries, a rite of passage for French gourmets was the eating of the Ortolan. These tiny birds\u2014captured alive, force-fed, then drowned in Armagnac\u2014were roasted whole and eaten that way, bones and all, while the diner draped his head with a linen napkin to preserve the precious aromas and, some believe, to hide from God.\n\"The Wine Spectator\"\nThe birds are caught with nets set during their autumn migratory flight to Africa. They are then kept in covered cages or boxes. They are then force-fed grain, usually millet seed, until they double their bulk. They are then suspended upside down over a container of Armagnac, and by dipping, made to drown, and then marinated in the brandy.\nThe birds are then plucked, salted and peppered and cooked in their own fat for seven minutes. Many consumers of this dish then place the bird feet first into their mouth while holding onto the bird's head. They eat the ortolan whole, with or without the head, and some may spit out the larger bones, while others eat the whole bird head, bones and all. The traditional way French gourmands eat ortolans is to cover their heads and face with a large napkin or towel while consuming the bird. The purpose of the towel is debated. Some claim it is to retain the maximum aroma with the flavour as they consume the entire bird at once, while according to \"The Daily Telegraph\", \"Tradition dictates that [the towel] is to shield \u2013 from God's eyes \u2013 the shame of such a decadent and disgraceful act\", and others have suggested the towel simply hides the consumers spitting out bones. This use of the towel was begun by a priest, a friend of Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.\nAt one time, the island of Cyprus formed a chief depot for the export of ortolans, which were pickled in spices and vinegar and packed in casks containing from 300 to 400 each. In the early 20th century, between 400 and 500 casks were annually exported from Cyprus.\nLegal status.\nOrtolan hunting was banned in France in 1999, but the law was poorly enforced and it is thought that up to 50,000 ortolans were illegally killed each year during the autumn migration: mostly birds from breeding grounds in Finland and the Baltic area. According to France's League for the Protection of Birds, France's ortolan population fell 30% between 1997 and 2007. In 2007, the French government vowed to strictly enforce some existing rules about banning the practice, with the maximum fine set at \u20ac6,000. Killing and cooking ortolans is banned across the European Union. In 2007, the pressure from France's League for Protection of Birds and from the EU resulted in the French government promising to enforce the EU directive protecting the ortolan. After several years of active citizen watch revealing little if any change in the field situation, the local representative of the government repeated this statement in 2016.\nEU member states prohibit:\nAs of 2018, the overall ortolan bunting's population is listed by the IUCN as Least Concern (LC). However, a 2019 study using stable isotopes, archival light geologgers, and population genetics suggests the species is in decline.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60972", "revid": "1315707329", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60972", "title": "Simple API for XML", "text": "Parsing algorithm for XML documents\nSAX (Simple API for XML) is an event-driven online algorithm for lexing and parsing XML documents, with an API developed by the XML-DEV mailing list. SAX provides a mechanism for reading data from an XML document that is an alternative to that provided by the Document Object Model (DOM). Where the DOM operates on the document as a whole\u2014building the full abstract syntax tree of an XML document for convenience of the user\u2014SAX parsers operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially, issuing parsing events while making a single pass through the input stream.\nDefinition.\nThe Java implementation of SAX () is considered to be normative since there is no formal specification. SAX processes documents state-independently, in contrast to DOM which is used for state-dependent processing of XML documents.\nBenefits.\nA SAX parser only needs to report each parsing event as it happens, and normally discards almost all of that information once reported (it does, however, keep some things, for example a list of all elements that have not been closed yet, in order to catch later errors such as end-tags in the wrong order). Thus, the minimum memory required for a SAX parser is proportional to the maximum depth of the XML file (i.e., of the XML tree) and the maximum data involved in a single XML event (such as the name and attributes of a single start-tag, or the content of a processing instruction, etc.).\nThis much memory is usually considered negligible. A DOM parser, in contrast, has to build a tree representation of the entire document in memory to begin with, thus using memory that increases with the entire document length. This takes considerable time and space for large documents (memory allocation and data-structure construction take time). The compensating advantage, of course, is that once loaded \"any\" part of the document can be accessed in any order.\nBecause of the event-driven nature of SAX, processing documents is generally far faster than DOM-style parsers, \"so long as\" the processing can be done in a start-to-end pass. Many tasks, such as indexing, conversion to other formats, very simple formatting and the like can be done that way. Other tasks, such as sorting, rearranging sections, getting from a link to its target, looking up information on one element to help process a later one and the like require accessing the document structure in complex orders and will be much faster with DOM than with multiple SAX passes.\nSome implementations do not neatly fit either category: a DOM approach can keep its persistent data on disk, cleverly organized for speed (editors such as SoftQuad Author/Editor and large-document browser/indexers such as DynaText do this); while a SAX approach can cleverly cache information for later use (any validating SAX parser keeps more information than described above). Such implementations blur the DOM/SAX tradeoffs, but are often very effective in practice.\nDue to the nature of DOM, streamed reading from disk requires techniques such as lazy evaluation, caches, virtual memory, persistent data structures, or other techniques (one such technique is disclosed in US patent 5557722). Processing XML documents larger than main memory is sometimes thought impossible because some DOM parsers do not allow it. However, it is no less possible than sorting a dataset larger than main memory using disk space as memory to sidestep this limitation.\nDrawbacks.\nThe event-driven model of SAX is useful for XML parsing, but it does have certain drawbacks.\nVirtually any kind of XML validation requires access to the document in full. The most trivial example is that an attribute declared in the DTD to be of type IDREF, requires that there be only one element in the document that uses the same value for an ID attribute. To validate this in a SAX parser, one must keep track of all ID attributes (any one of them \"might\" end up being referenced by an IDREF attribute at the very end); as well as every IDREF attribute until it is resolved. Similarly, to validate that each element has an acceptable sequence of child elements, information about what child elements have been seen for each parent must be kept until the parent closes.\nAdditionally, some kinds of XML processing simply require having access to the entire document. XSLT and XPath, for example, need to be able to access any node at any time in the parsed XML tree. Editors and browsers likewise need to be able to display, modify, and perhaps re-validate at any time. While a SAX parser may well be used to construct such a tree initially, SAX provides no help for such processing as a whole.\nXML processing with SAX.\nA parser that implements SAX (i.e., \"a SAX Parser\") functions as a stream parser, with an event-driven API. The user defines a number of callback methods that will be called when events occur during parsing. The SAX events include (among others):\nSome events correspond to XML objects that are easily returned all at once, such as comments. However, XML \"elements\" can contain many other XML objects, and so SAX represents them as does XML itself: by one event at the beginning, and another at the end. Properly speaking, the SAX interface does not deal in \"elements\", but in \"events\" that largely correspond to \"tags\". SAX parsing is unidirectional; previously parsed data cannot be re-read without starting the parsing operation again.\nThere are many SAX-like implementations in existence. In practice, details vary, but the overall model is the same. For example, XML attributes are typically provided as name and value arguments passed to element events, but can also be provided as separate events, or via a hash table or similar collection of all the attributes. For another, some implementations provide \"Init\" and \"Fin\" callbacks for the very start and end of parsing; others do not. The exact names for given event types also vary slightly between implementations.\nExample.\nGiven the following XML document:\n &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?&gt;\n &lt;DocumentElement param=\"value\"&gt;\n &lt;FirstElement&gt;\n &amp;#xb6; Some Text\n &lt;/FirstElement&gt;\n &lt;?some_pi some_attr=\"some_value\"?&gt;\n &lt;SecondElement param2=\"something\"&gt;\n Pre-Text &lt;Inline&gt;Inlined text&lt;/Inline&gt; Post-text.\n &lt;/SecondElement&gt;\n&lt;/DocumentElement&gt;\nThis XML document, when passed through a SAX parser, will generate a sequence of events like the following:\nNote that the first line of the sample above is the XML Declaration and not a processing instruction; as such it will not be reported as a processing instruction event (although some SAX implementations provide a separate event just for the XML declaration).\nThe result above may vary: the SAX specification deliberately states that a given section of text may be reported as multiple sequential text events. Many parsers, for example, return separate text events for numeric character references. Thus in the example above, a SAX parser may generate a different series of events, part of which might include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Implicitly, countries must design and develop health systems in accordance with their needs and resources, although common elements in virtually all health systems are primary healthcare and public health measures.\nIn certain countries, the orchestration of health system planning is decentralized, with various stakeholders in the market assuming responsibilities. In contrast, in other regions, a collaborative endeavor exists among governmental entities, labor unions, philanthropic organizations, religious institutions, or other organized bodies, aimed at the meticulous provision of healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of their respective populations. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the process of healthcare planning is frequently characterized as an evolutionary progression rather than a revolutionary transformation.\nAs with other social institutional structures, health systems are likely to reflect the history, culture and economics of the states in which they evolve. These peculiarities bedevil and complicate international comparisons and preclude any universal standard of performance.\nGoals.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations system, healthcare systems' goals are good health for the citizens, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair means of funding operations. Progress towards them depends on how systems carry out four vital functions: provision of health care services, resource generation, financing, and stewardship. Other dimensions for the evaluation of health systems include quality, efficiency, acceptability, and equity. They have also been described in the United States as \"the five C's\": Cost, Coverage, Consistency, Complexity, and Chronic Illness. Also, continuity of health care is a major goal.\nDefinitions.\nOften health system has been defined with a reductionist perspective. Some authors have developed arguments to expand the concept of health systems, indicating additional dimensions that should be considered:\nWorld Health Organization.\nThe World Health Organization defines health systems as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities. A health system is, therefore, more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother caring for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector-control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter-sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well-known determinant of better health.\nFinancial resources.\nThere are generally five primary methods of funding health systems:\nMost countries' systems feature a mix of all five models. One study based on data from the OECD concluded that all types of health care finance \"are compatible with\" an efficient health system. The study also found no relationship between financing and cost control. Another study examining single payer and multi payer systems in OECD countries found that single payer systems have significantly less hospital beds per 100,000 people than in multi payer systems.\nThe term health insurance is generally used to describe a form of insurance that pays for medical expenses. It is sometimes used more broadly to include insurance covering disability or long-term nursing or custodial care needs. It may be provided through a social insurance program, or from private insurance companies. It may be obtained on a group basis (e.g., by a firm to cover its employees) or purchased by individual consumers. In each case premiums or taxes protect the insured from high or unexpected health care expenses.\nThrough the calculation of the comprehensive cost of healthcare expenditures, it becomes feasible to construct a standard financial framework, which may involve mechanisms like monthly premiums or annual taxes. This ensures the availability of funds to cover the healthcare benefits delineated in the insurance agreement. Typically, the administration of these benefits is overseen by a government agency, a nonprofit health fund, or a commercial corporation.\nMany commercial health insurers control their costs by restricting the benefits provided, by such means as deductibles, copayments, co-insurance, policy exclusions, and total coverage limits. They will also severely restrict or refuse coverage of pre-existing conditions. Many government systems also have co-payment arrangements but express exclusions are rare or limited because of political pressure. The larger insurance systems may also negotiate fees with providers.\nMany forms of social insurance systems control their costs by using the bargaining power of the community they are intended to serve to control costs in the health care delivery system. They may attempt to do so by, for example, negotiating drug prices directly with pharmaceutical companies, negotiating standard fees with the medical profession, or reducing unnecessary health care costs. Social systems sometimes feature contributions related to earnings as part of a system to deliver universal health care, which may or may not also involve the use of commercial and non-commercial insurers. Essentially the wealthier users pay proportionately more into the system to cover the needs of the poorer users who therefore contribute proportionately less. There are usually caps on the contributions of the wealthy and minimum payments that must be made by the insured (often in the form of a minimum contribution, similar to a deductible in commercial insurance models).\nIn addition to these traditional health care financing methods, some lower income countries and development partners are also implementing non-traditional or innovative financing mechanisms for scaling up delivery and sustainability of health care, such as micro-contributions, public-private partnerships, and market-based financial transaction taxes. For example, as of June 2011, Unitaid had collected more than one billion dollars from 29 member countries, including several from Africa, through an air ticket solidarity levy to expand access to care and treatment for HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in 94 countries.\nPayment models.\nIn most countries, wage costs for healthcare practitioners are estimated to represent between 65% and 80% of renewable health system expenditures. There are three ways to pay medical practitioners: fee for service, capitation, and salary. There has been growing interest in blending elements of these systems.\nFee-for-service.\nFee-for-service arrangements pay general practitioners (GPs) based on the service. They are even more widely used for specialists working in ambulatory care.\nThere are two ways to set fee levels:&lt;ref name=\"docteur/oxley\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nCapitation.\nIn capitation payment systems, GPs are paid for each patient on their \"list\", usually with adjustments for factors such as age and gender. According to OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), \"these systems are used in Italy (with some fees), in all four countries of the United Kingdom (with some fees and allowances for specific services), Austria (with fees for specific services), Denmark (one third of income with remainder fee for service), Ireland (since 1989), the Netherlands (fee-for-service for privately insured patients and public employees) and Sweden (from 1994). Capitation payments have become more frequent in \"managed care\" environments in the United States.\"\nAccording to OECD, \"capitation systems allow funders to control the overall level of primary health expenditures, and the allocation of funding among GPs is determined by patient registrations\". However, under this approach, GPs may register too many patients and under-serve them, select the better risks and refer on patients who could have been treated by the GP directly. Freedom of consumer choice over doctors, coupled with the principle of \"money following the patient\" may moderate some of these risks. Aside from selection, these problems are likely to be less marked than under salary-type arrangements.'\nSalary arrangements.\nIn several OECD countries, general practitioners (GPs) are employed on \"salaries\" for the government. According to OECD, \"Salary arrangements allow funders to control primary care costs directly; however, they may lead to under-provision of services (to ease workloads), excessive referrals to secondary providers and lack of attention to the preferences of patients.\" There has been movement away from this system.\nValue-based care.\nIn recent years, providers have been switching from fee-for-service payment models to a value-based care payment system, where they are compensated for providing value to patients. In this system, providers are given incentives to close gaps in care and provide better quality care for patients.\nInformation resources.\nSound information plays an increasingly critical role in the delivery of modern health care and efficiency of health systems. Health informatics\u00a0\u2013 the intersection of information science, medicine and healthcare\u00a0\u2013 deals with the resources, devices, and methods required to optimize the acquisition and use of information in health and biomedicine. Necessary tools for proper health information coding and management include clinical guidelines, formal medical terminologies, and computers and other information and communication technologies. The kinds of health data processed may include patients' medical records, hospital administration and clinical functions, and human resources information.\nThe use of health information lies at the root of evidence-based policy and evidence-based management in health care. Increasingly, information and communication technologies are being utilised to improve health systems in developing countries through: the standardisation of health information; computer-aided diagnosis and treatment monitoring; informing population groups on health and treatment.\nManagement.\nThe management of any health system is typically directed through a set of policies and plans adopted by government, private sector business and other groups in areas such as personal healthcare delivery and financing, pharmaceuticals, health human resources, and public health.\nPublic health is concerned with threats to the overall health of a community based on population health analysis. The population in question can be as small as a handful of people, or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents (for instance, in the case of a pandemic). Public health is typically divided into epidemiology, biostatistics and health services. Environmental, social, behavioral, and occupational health are also important subfields.\nToday, most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease, disability, the effects of ageing and health inequities, although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine. For example, most countries have a vaccination policy, supporting public health programs in providing vaccinations to promote health. Vaccinations are voluntary in some countries and mandatory in some countries. Some governments pay all or part of the costs for vaccines in a national vaccination schedule.\nThe rapid emergence of many chronic diseases, which require costly long-term care and treatment, is making many health managers and policy makers re-examine their healthcare delivery practices. An important health issue facing the world currently is HIV/AIDS. Another major public health concern is diabetes. In 2006, according to the World Health Organization, at least 171 million people worldwide had diabetes. Its incidence is increasing rapidly, and it is estimated that by 2030, this number will double. A controversial aspect of public health is the control of tobacco smoking, linked to cancer and other chronic illnesses.\nAntibiotic resistance is another major concern, leading to the reemergence of diseases such as tuberculosis. The World Health Organization, for its World Health Day 2011 campaign, called for intensified global commitment to safeguard antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines for future generations.\nHealth systems performance.\nSince 2000, more and more initiatives have been taken at the international and national levels in order to strengthen national health systems as the core components of the global health system. Having this scope in mind, it is essential to have a clear, and unrestricted, vision of national health systems that might generate further progress in global health. The elaboration and the selection of performance indicators are indeed both highly dependent on the conceptual framework adopted for the evaluation of the health systems performance. Like most social systems, health systems are complex adaptive systems where change does not necessarily follow rigid management models. In complex systems path dependency, emergent properties and other non-linear patterns are seen, which can lead to the development of inappropriate guidelines for developing responsive health systems.\nQuality frameworks are essential tools for understanding and improving health systems. They help define, prioritize, and implement health system goals and functions. Among the key frameworks is the World Health Organization's building blocks model, which enhances health quality by focusing on elements like financing, workforce, information, medical products, governance, and service delivery. This model influences global health evaluation and contributes to indicator development and research.\nThe Lancet Global Health Commission's 2018 framework builds upon earlier models by emphasizing system foundations, processes, and outcomes, guided by principles of efficiency, resilience, equity, and people-centeredness. This comprehensive approach addresses challenges associated with chronic and complex conditions and is particularly influential in health services research in developing countries. Importantly, recent developments also highlight the need to integrate environmental sustainability into these frameworks, suggesting its inclusion as a guiding principle to enhance the environmental responsiveness of health systems.\nAn increasing number of tools and guidelines are being published by international agencies and development partners to assist health system decision-makers to monitor and assess health systems strengthening including human resources development using standard definitions, indicators and measures. In response to a series of papers published in 2012 by members of the World Health Organization's Task Force on Developing Health Systems Guidance, researchers from the Future Health Systems consortium argue that there is insufficient focus on the 'policy implementation gap'. Recognizing the diversity of stakeholders and complexity of health systems is crucial to ensure that evidence-based guidelines are tested with requisite humility and without a rigid adherence to models dominated by a limited number of disciplines. Healthcare services often implement Quality Improvement Initiatives to overcome this policy implementation gap. Although many of these initiatives deliver improved healthcare, a large proportion fail to be sustained. Numerous tools and frameworks have been created to respond to this challenge and increase improvement longevity. One tool highlighted the need for these tools to respond to user preferences and settings to optimize impact.\nHealth Policy and Systems Research (HPSR) is an emerging multidisciplinary field that challenges 'disciplinary capture' by dominant health research traditions, arguing that these traditions generate premature and inappropriately narrow definitions that impede rather than enhance health systems strengthening. HPSR focuses on low- and middle-income countries and draws on the relativist social science paradigm which recognises that all phenomena are constructed through human behaviour and interpretation. In using this approach, HPSR offers insight into health systems by generating a complex understanding of context in order to enhance health policy learning. HPSR calls for greater involvement of local actors, including policy makers, civil society and researchers, in decisions that are made around funding health policy research and health systems strengthening.\nSpending.\nExpand the OECD charts below to see the breakdown:\nInternational comparisons.\nHealth systems can vary substantially from country to country, and in the last few years, comparisons have been made on an international basis. The World Health Organization, in its \"World Health Report 2000\", provided a ranking of health systems around the world according to criteria of the overall level and distribution of health in the populations, and the responsiveness and fair financing of health care services. The goals for health systems, according to the WHO's \"World Health Report 2000 \u2013 Health systems: improving performance\" (WHO, 2000), are good health, responsiveness to the expectations of the population, and fair financial contribution. There have been several debates around the results of this WHO exercise, and especially based on the country ranking linked to it, insofar as it appeared to depend mostly on the choice of the retained indicators.\nDirect comparisons of health statistics across nations are complex. The Commonwealth Fund, in its annual survey, \"Mirror, Mirror on the Wall\", compares the performance of the health systems in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada and the United States. Its 2007 study found that, although the United States system is the most expensive, it consistently underperforms compared to the other countries. A major difference between the United States and the other countries in the study is that the United States is the only country without universal health care. The OECD also collects comparative statistics, and has published brief country profiles. Health Consumer Powerhouse makes comparisons between both national health care systems in the Euro health consumer index and specific areas of health care such as diabetes or hepatitis.\nIpsos MORI produces an annual study of public perceptions of healthcare services across 30 countries.\nPhysicians and hospital beds per 1000 inhabitants vs Health Care Spending in 2008 for OECD Countries. The data source is http://. Since 2008, the US experienced big deviations from 16% GDP. In 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act was enacted, health care spending accounted for approximately 17.2% of the U.S. GDP. By 2019, before the pandemic, it had risen to 17.7%. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this percentage jumped to 18.8% in 2020, largely due to increased health care costs and economic contraction. Post-pandemic, health care spending relative to GDP declined to 16.6% by 2022.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "60980", "revid": "5846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60980", "title": "Digital Visual Interface", "text": "Standard for transmitting digital video to a display\nDigital Visual Interface (DVI) is a video display interface developed by the Digital Display Working Group (DDWG). The digital interface is used to connect a video source, such as a video display controller, to a display device, such as a computer monitor. It was developed with the intention of creating an industry standard for the transfer of uncompressed digital video content.\nDVI devices manufactured as DVI-I have support for analog connections, and are compatible with the analog VGA interface by including VGA pins, while DVI-D devices are digital-only. This compatibility, along with other advantages, led to its widespread acceptance over competing digital display standards Plug and Display (P&amp;D) and Digital Flat Panel (DFP). Although DVI is predominantly associated with computers, it is sometimes used in other consumer electronics such as television sets and DVD players.\nHistory.\nAn earlier attempt to promulgate an updated standard to the analog VGA connector was made by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) in 1994 and 1995, with the Enhanced Video Connector (EVC), which was intended to consolidate cables between the computer and monitor. EVC used a 35-pin Molex MicroCross connector and carried analog video (input and output), analog stereo audio (input and output), and data (via USB and FireWire). At the same time, with the increasing availability of digital flat-panel displays, the priority shifted to digital video transmission, which would remove the extra analog/digital conversion steps required for VGA and EVC; the EVC connector was reused by VESA, which released the Plug &amp; Display (P&amp;D) standard in 1997. P&amp;D offered single-link TMDS digital video with, as an option, analog video output and data (USB and FireWire), using a 35-pin MicroCross connector similar to EVC; the analog audio and video input lines from EVC were repurposed to carry digital video for P&amp;D.\nBecause P&amp;D was a physically large, expensive connector, a consortium of companies developed the DFP standard (1999), which was focused solely on digital video transmission using a 20-pin micro ribbon connector and omitted the analog video and data capabilities of P&amp;D. DVI instead chose to strip just the data functions from P&amp;D, using a 29-pin MicroCross connector to carry digital and analog video. Critically, DVI allows dual-link TMDS signals, meaning it supports higher resolutions than the single-link P&amp;D and DFP connectors, which led to its successful adoption as an industry standard. Compatibility of DVI with P&amp;D and DFP is accomplished typically through passive adapters that provide appropriate physical interfaces, as all three standards use the same DDC/EDID handshaking protocols and TMDS digital video signals.\nDVI made its way into products starting in 1999. One of the first DVI monitors was Apple's original Cinema Display, which launched in 1999.\nTechnical overview.\nDVI's digital video transmission format is based on panelLink, a serial format developed by Silicon Image that utilizes a high-speed serial link called transition minimized differential signaling (TMDS).\nTMDS.\nDigital video pixel data is transported using multiple TMDS twisted pairs. At the electrical level, these pairs are highly resistant to electrical noise and other forms of analog distortion.\nSingle link.\nA \"single link\" DVI connection has four TMDS pairs. Three data pairs carry their designated 8-bit RGB component (red, green, or blue) of the video signal for a total of 24\u00a0bits per pixel. The fourth pair carries the TMDS clock. The binary data is encoded using 8b/10b encoding. DVI does not use packetization, but rather transmits the pixel data as if it were a rasterized analog video signal. As such, the complete frame is \"drawn\" during each vertical refresh period. The full active area of each frame is always transmitted without compression. Video modes typically use horizontal and vertical refresh timings that are compatible with cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays, though this is not a requirement. In single link mode, the maximum TMDS clock frequency is 165\u00a0MHz, which supports a maximum resolution of 2.75\u00a0megapixels (including blanking interval) at 60\u00a0Hz refresh. For practical purposes, this allows a maximum 16:10 screen resolution of 1920\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01200 at 60\u00a0Hz.\nDual link.\nTo support higher-resolution display devices, the DVI specification contains a provision for \"dual link\". Dual link DVI doubles the number of TMDS data pairs, effectively doubling the video bandwidth, which allows higher resolutions up to 2560\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01600 at 60\u00a0Hz or higher refresh rates for lower resolutions.\nCompatibility.\nFor backward compatibility with displays using analog VGA signals, some of the contacts in the DVI connector carry the analog VGA signals.\nTo ensure a basic level of interoperability, DVI compliant devices are required to support one baseline display mode, \"low pixel format\" (640\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0480 at 60\u00a0Hz).\nDDC.\nLike modern analog VGA connectors, the DVI connector includes pins for the display data channel (DDC), which allows the graphics adapter to read the monitor's extended display identification data (EDID). When a source and display using the DDC2 revision are connected, the source first queries the display's capabilities by reading the monitor EDID block over an I\u00b2C link. The EDID block contains the display's identification, color characteristics (such as gamma value), and table of supported video modes. The table can designate a preferred mode or native resolution. Each mode is a set of timing values that define the duration and frequency of the horizontal/vertical sync, the positioning of the active display area, the horizontal resolution, vertical resolution, and refresh rate.\nCable length.\nThe maximum length recommended for DVI cables is not included in the specification, since it is dependent on the TMDS clock frequency. In general, cable lengths up to will work for display resolutions up to 1920\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01200. Longer cables up to in length can be used with display resolutions 1280\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01024 or lower. For greater distances, the use of a DVI booster\u2014a signal repeater which may use an external power supply\u2014is recommended to help mitigate signal degradation.\nConnector.\nThe DVI connector on a device is given one of three names, depending on which signals it implements:\nMost DVI connector types\u2014the exception is DVI-A\u2014have pins that pass digital video signals. These come in two varieties: single link and dual link. Single link DVI employs a single transmitter with a TMDS clock up to 165\u00a0MHz that supports resolutions up to 1920\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01200 at 60\u00a0Hz. Dual link DVI adds six pins, at the center of the connector, for a second transmitter increasing the bandwidth and supporting resolutions up to 2560\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01600 at 60\u00a0Hz. A connector with these additional pins is sometimes referred to as DVI-DL (dual link). Dual link should not be confused with \"dual display\" (also known as \"dual head\"), which is a configuration consisting of a single computer connected to two monitors, sometimes using a DMS-59 connector for two single link DVI connections.\nIn addition to digital, some DVI connectors also have pins that pass an analog signal, which can be used to connect an analog monitor. The analog pins are the four that surround the flat blade on a DVI-I or DVI-A connector. A VGA monitor, for example, can be connected to a video source with DVI-I through the use of a passive adapter. Since the analog pins are directly compatible with VGA signaling, passive adapters are simple and cheap to produce, providing a cost-effective solution to support VGA on DVI. The long flat pin on a DVI-I connector is wider than the same pin on a DVI-D connector, so even if the four analog pins were manually removed, it still wouldn't be possible to connect a male DVI-I to a female DVI-D. It is possible, however, to join a male DVI-D connector with a female DVI-I connector.\nDVI is the only widespread video standard that includes analog and digital transmission in the same connector. Competing standards are exclusively digital: these include a system using low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS), known by its proprietary names FPD-Link (flat-panel display) and FLATLINK; and its successors, the LVDS Display Interface (LDI) and OpenLDI.\nSome DVD players, HDTV sets, and video projectors have DVI connectors that transmit an encrypted signal for copy protection using the High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) protocol. Computers can be connected to HDTV sets over DVI, but the graphics card must support HDCP to play content protected by digital rights management (DRM).\nSpecifications.\nDigital.\nGeneralized Timing Formula (GTF) is a VESA standard which can easily be calculated with the Linux gtf utility. Coordinated Video Timings-Reduced Blanking (CVT-RB) is a VESA standard which offers reduced horizontal and vertical blanking for non-CRT based displays.\nDigital data encoding.\nOne of the purposes of DVI stream encoding is to provide a DC-balanced output that reduces decoding errors. This goal is achieved by using 10-bit symbols for 8-bit or less characters and using the extra bits for the DC balancing.\nLike other ways of transmitting video, there are two different regions: the active region, where pixel data is sent, and the control region, where synchronization signals are sent. The active region is encoded using transition-minimized differential signaling, where the control region is encoded with a fixed 8b/10b encoding. As the two schemes yield different 10-bit symbols, a receiver can fully differentiate between active and control regions.\nWhen DVI was designed, most computer monitors were still of the cathode-ray tube type that require analog video synchronization signals. The timing of the digital synchronization signals matches the equivalent analog ones, so the process of transforming DVI to and from an analog signal does not require extra (high-speed) memory, expensive at the time.\nHDCP is an extra layer that transforms the 10-bit symbols before transmitting. Only after correct authorization can the receiver undo the HDCP encryption. Control regions are not encrypted in order to let the receiver know when the active region starts.\nClock and data relationship.\nDVI provide one TMDS clock pair and 3 TMDS data pairs in single link mode or 6 TMDS data pairs in dual link mode. TMDS data pairs operate at a gross bit rate that is 10 times the frequency of the TMDS clock. In each TMDS clock period there is a 10-bit symbol per TMDS data pair representing 8-bits of pixel color. In single link mode each set of three 10-bit symbols represents one 24-bit pixel, while in dual link mode each set of six 10-bit symbols either represents two 24-bit pixels or one pixel of up to 48-bit color depth.\nThe specification document allows the data and the clock to not be aligned. However, as the ratio between the TMDS clock and gross bit rate per TMDS pair is fixed at 1:10, the unknown alignment is kept over time. The receiver must recover the bits on the stream using any of the techniques of clock/data recovery to find the correct symbol boundary. The DVI specification allows the TMDS clock to vary between 25\u00a0MHz and 165\u00a0MHz. This 1:6.6 ratio can make clock recovery difficult, as phase-locked loops, if used, need to work over a large frequency range. One benefit of DVI over other interfaces is that it is relatively straightforward to transform the signal from the digital domain into the analog domain using a video DAC, as both clock and synchronization signals are transmitted. Fixed frequency interfaces, like DisplayPort, need to reconstruct the clock from the transmitted data.\nDisplay power management.\nThe DVI specification includes signaling for reducing power consumption. Similar to the analog VESA display power management signaling (DPMS) standard, a connected device can turn a monitor off when the connected device is powered down, or programmatically if the display controller of the device supports it. Devices with this capability can also attain Energy Star certification.\nAnalog.\nThe analog section of the DVI specification document is brief and points to other specifications like VESA VSIS for electrical characteristics and GTFS for timing information. The motivation for including analog is to keep compatibility with the previous VGA cables and connectors. VGA pins for HSync, Vsync and three video channels are available in both DVI-I or DVI-A (but not DVI-D) connectors and are electrically compatible, while pins for DDC (clock and data) and 5 V power and ground are kept in all DVI connectors. Thus, a passive adapter can interface between DVI-I or DVI-A (but not DVI-D) and VGA connectors.\nDVI and HDMI compatibility.\nHDMI is a newer digital audio/video interface developed and promoted by the consumer electronics industry. DVI and HDMI have the same electrical specifications for their TMDS and VESA/DDC twisted pairs. However HDMI and DVI differ in several key ways.\nTo promote interoperability between DVI-D and HDMI devices, HDMI source components and displays support DVI-D signaling. For example, an HDMI display can be driven by a DVI-D source because HDMI and DVI-D both define an overlapping minimum set of supported resolutions and frame buffer formats.\nSome DVI-D sources use non-standard extensions to output HDMI signals including audio (e.g. ATI 3000-series and NVIDIA GTX 200-series). Some multimedia displays use a DVI to HDMI adapter to input the HDMI signal with audio. Exact capabilities vary by video card specifications.\nIn the reverse scenario, a DVI display that lacks optional support for HDCP might be unable to display protected content even though it is otherwise compatible with the HDMI source. Features specific to HDMI such as remote control, audio transport, xvYCC and deep color are not usable in devices that support only DVI signals. HDCP compatibility between source and destination devices is subject to manufacturer specifications for each device.\nProposed successors.\nIn December 2010, Intel, AMD, and several computer and display manufacturers announced they would stop supporting DVI-I, VGA and LVDS-technologies from 2013/2015, and instead speed up adoption of DisplayPort and HDMI. They also stated: \"Legacy interfaces such as VGA, DVI and LVDS have not kept pace, and newer standards such as DisplayPort and HDMI clearly provide the best connectivity options moving forward. In our opinion, DisplayPort 1.2 is the future interface for PC monitors, along with HDMI 1.4a for TV connectivity\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They involve the application of four battlefield functions which are closely related \u2013 kinetic or firepower, mobility, protection or security, and shock action. Tactics are a separate function from command and control and logistics. In contemporary military science, tactics are the lowest of three levels of warfighting, the higher levels being the strategic and operational levels. Throughout history, there has been a shifting balance between the four tactical functions, generally based on the application of military technology, which has led to one or more of the tactical functions being dominant for a period of time, usually accompanied by the dominance of an associated fighting arm deployed on the battlefield, such as infantry, artillery, cavalry or tanks.\nTactical functions.\nKinetic or firepower.\nBeginning with the use of melee and missile weapons such as clubs and spears, the kinetic or firepower function of tactics has developed along with technological advances so that the emphasis has shifted over time from the close-range melee and missile weapons to longer-range projectile weapons. Kinetic effects were generally delivered by the sword, spear, javelin and bow until the introduction of artillery by the Romans. Until the mid 19th century, the value of infantry-delivered missile firepower was not high, meaning that the result of a given battle was rarely decided by infantry firepower alone, often relying on artillery to deliver significant kinetic effects. The development of disciplined volley fire, delivered at close range, began to improve the hitting power of infantry, and compensated in part for the limited range, poor accuracy and low rate of fire of early muskets. Advances in technology, particularly the introduction of the rifled musket, used in the Crimean War and American Civil War, meant flatter trajectories and improved accuracy at greater ranges, along with higher casualties. The resulting increase in defensive firepower meant infantry attacks without artillery support became increasingly difficult. Firepower also became crucial to fixing an enemy in place to allow a decisive strike. Machine guns added significantly to infantry firepower at the turn of the 20th century, and the mobile firepower provided by tanks, self-propelled artillery and military aircraft rose significantly in the century that followed. Along with infantry weapons, tanks and other armoured vehicles, self-propelled artillery, guided weapons and aircraft provide the firepower of modern armies.\nMobility.\nMobility, which determines how quickly a fighting force can move, was for most of human history limited by the speed of a soldier on foot, even when supplies were carried by beasts of burden. With this restriction, most armies could not travel more than per day, unless travelling on rivers. Only small elements of a force such as cavalry or specially trained light troops could exceed this limit. This restriction on tactical mobility remained until the latter years of World War I when the advent of the tank improved mobility sufficiently to allow decisive tactical manoeuvre. Despite this advance, full tactical mobility was not achieved until World War II when armoured and motorised formations achieved remarkable successes. However, large elements of the armies of World War II remained reliant on horse-drawn transport, which limited tactical mobility within the overall force. Tactical mobility can be limited by the use of field obstacles, often created by military engineers.\nProtection and security.\nPersonal armour has been worn since the classical period to provide a measure of individual protection, which was also extended to include barding of the mount. The limitations of armour have always been weight and bulk, and its consequent effects on mobility as well as human and animal endurance. By the 18th and 19th centuries, personal armour had been largely discarded, until the re-introduction of helmets during World War I in response to the firepower of artillery. Armoured fighting vehicles proliferated during World War II, and after that war, body armour returned for the infantry, particularly in Western armies. Fortifications, which have been used since ancient times, provide collective protection, and modern examples include entrenchments, roadblocks, barbed wire and minefields. Like obstacles, fortifications are often created by military engineers.\nShock action.\nShock action is as much a psychological function of tactics as a physical one, and can be significantly enhanced by the use of surprise. It has been provided by charging infantry, and as well as by chariots, war elephants, cavalry and armoured vehicles which provide momentum to an assault. It has also been used in a defensive way, for example by the drenching flights of arrows from English longbowmen at the Battle of Agincourt in 1415 which caused the horses of the French knights to panic. During early modern warfare, the use of the tactical formations of columns and lines had a greater effect than the firepower of the formations alone. During the early stages of World War II, the combined effects of German machine gun and tank gun firepower, enhanced by accurate indirect fire and air attack, often broke up Allied units before their assault commenced, or caused them to falter due to casualties among key unit leaders. In both the early modern and World War II examples, the cumulative psychological shock effect on the enemy was often greater than the actual casualties incurred.\nDevelopment over time.\nThe development of tactics has involved a shifting balance between the four tactical functions since ancient times, and changes in firepower and mobility have been fundamental to these changes. Various models have been proposed to explain the interaction between the tactical functions and the dominance of individual fighting arms during different periods. J. F. C. Fuller proposed three \"tactical cycles\" in each of the classical and Christian eras. For the latter epoch, he proposed a \"shock\" cycle between 650 and 1450, a \"shock and projectile\" cycle 1450\u20131850, and a \"projectile\" cycle from 1850, with respect to the Western and North American warfare. During World War II, Tom Wintringham proposed six chronological periods, which alternate the dominance between unarmoured and armoured forces and highlight tactical trends in each period.\nMassed volley fire by archers brought infantry firepower to the fore in Japanese warfare in the second half of the 13th century, preceding the rise of the English longbowman. The mobility and shock action of the Oirat Mongol army at the Battle of Tumu in 1449 demonstrated that cavalry could still defeat a large infantry force. In both the European and Oriental traditions of warfare, the advent of gunpowder during the late Medieval and Early Modern periods created a relentless shift to infantry firepower becoming \"a decisive, if not dominant\" arm on the battlefield, exemplified by the significant impact of massed arquebusiers at the Battle of Nagashino in 1575.\nCombined arms tactics.\nThe synchronisation of the various fighting arms to achieve the tactical mission is known as combined arms tactics. One method of measuring tactical effectiveness is the extent to which the arms, including military aviation, are integrated on the battlefield. A key principle of effective combined arms tactics is that for maximum potential to be achieved, all elements of combined arms teams need the same level of mobility, and sufficient firepower and protection. The history of the development of combined arms tactics has been dogged by costly and painful lessons. For example, while German commanders in World War II clearly understood from the outset the key principle of combined arms tactics outlined above, British commanders were late to this realisation. Successful combined arms tactics require the fighting arms to train alongside each other and to be familiar with each other's capabilities.\nImpact of air power.\nBeginning in the latter stages of World War I, airpower has brought a significant change to military tactics. World War II saw the development of close air support which greatly enhanced the effect of ground forces with the use of aerial firepower and improved tactical reconnaissance and the interdiction of hostile air power. It also made possible the supply of ground forces by air, achieved by the British during the Burma Campaign but unsuccessful for the Germans at the Battle of Stalingrad. Following World War II, rotary-wing aircraft had a significant impact on firepower and mobility, comprising a fighting arm in its own right in many armies. Aircraft, particularly those operating at low or medium altitudes, remain vulnerable to ground-based air defence systems as well as other aircraft.\nParachute and glider operations and rotary-wing aircraft have provided significant mobility to ground forces but the reduced mobility, protection and firepower of troops delivered by air once landed has limited the tactical utility of such vertical envelopment or air assault operations. This was demonstrated during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, and during the Vietnam War, in the latter case despite the additional firepower provided by helicopter gunships and the ability quickly to remove casualties, provided by aeromedical evacuation.\nConcept.\nMilitary tactics answer the questions of how best to deploy and employ forces on a small scale. Some practices have not changed since the dawn of warfare: assault, ambushes, skirmishing, turning flanks, reconnaissance, creating and using obstacles and defenses, etc. Using ground to best advantage has not changed much either. Heights, rivers, swamps, passes, choke points, and natural cover, can all be used in multiple ways. Before the nineteenth century, many military tactics were confined to battlefield concerns: how to maneuver units during combat in open terrain. Nowadays, specialized tactics exist for many situations, for example for securing a room in a building.\nTechnological changes can render existing tactics obsolete, and sociological changes can shift the goals and methods of warfare, requiring new tactics. Tactics define how soldiers are armed and trained. Thus technology and society influence the development of types of soldiers or warriors through history: Greek hoplite, Roman legionary, medieval knight, Turk-Mongol horse archer, Chinese crossbowman, or an air cavalry trooper. Each \u2013 constrained by his weaponry, logistics and social conditioning \u2013 would use a battlefield differently, but would usually seek the same outcomes from their use of tactics. The First World War forced great changes in tactics as advances in technology rendered prior tactics useless.\n\"Gray-zone\" tactics are also becoming more widely used. These include \"everything from strong-arm diplomacy and economic coercion, to media manipulation and cyberattacks, to use of paramilitaries and proxy forces\". The title \"gray-zone\" comes from the ambiguity between defense vs. offense, as well as the ambiguity between peace-keeping vs. war effort.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

These ships were both quicker and cheaper to build than larger fleet carriers and were built in great numbers to serve as a stop-gap measure when fleet carriers were too few. However, they were usually too slow to keep up with naval task forces and would typically be assigned to amphibious operations, often seen in the Pacific War's island hopping campaign, or to convoy protection in the war in the Atlantic. To that end, many of these ships were transferred to the Royal Navy as part of the US-UK lend-lease program.

{"id": "60984", "revid": "33299132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60984", "title": "Siege of Orl\u00e9ans", "text": "Turning point in the Hundred Years' War\nThe siege of Orl\u00e9ans (12 October 1428 \u2013 8 May 1429) marked a turning point of the Hundred Years' War between France and England. The siege took place at the pinnacle of English power during the later stages of the war, but was repulsed by French forces inspired by the arrival of Joan of Arc. The French would then regain the initiative in the conflict and began to recapture territories previously occupied by the English.\nThe city held strategic and symbolic significance to both sides of the conflict. The consensus among contemporaries was that the English regent, John of Lancaster, would have succeeded in realising his brother the English king Henry V's dream of conquering all of France if Orl\u00e9ans fell. For half a year the English and their French allies appeared to be on the verge of capturing the city, but the siege collapsed nine days after Joan of Arc arrived.\nBackground.\nHundred Years' War.\nThe siege of Orl\u00e9ans occurred during the Hundred Years' War, an inheritance dispute over the French throne between the ruling houses of France and England. The conflict had begun in 1337 when England's King Edward III decided to press his claim to the French throne, a claim based on his status as the son of Isabella of France and thus of the contested French royal line.\nFollowing a decisive victory at Agincourt in 1415, the English gained the upper hand in the conflict, occupying much of northern France. Under the Treaty of Troyes of 1420, England's Henry V became regent of France. By this treaty, Henry married Catherine, the daughter of the current French king, Charles VI, and would then succeed to the French throne upon Charles's death. The Dauphin of France (title given to the French heir apparent), Charles, the son of the French king, was then disinherited.\nGeography.\nOrl\u00e9ans is located on the river Loire in north-central France. During the time of this siege, it was the northernmost city that remained loyal to the Valois French crown. The English and their Burgundian allies controlled the rest of northern France, including Paris. Orl\u00e9ans's position on a major river made it the last obstacle to a campaign into central France. England already controlled France's southwestern coast.\nArmagnac party.\nAs the capital of the duchy of Orl\u00e9ans, this city held symbolic significance in early 15th century politics. The dukes of Orl\u00e9ans were at the head of a political faction known as the Armagnacs, who rejected the Treaty of Troyes and supported the claims of the disinherited and banished Dauphin Charles to the French throne. This faction had been in existence for two generations. Its leader, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, also in line for the throne, was one of the very few combatants from Agincourt who remained a prisoner of the English fourteen years after the battle.\nUnder the customs of chivalry, a city that surrendered to an invading army without a struggle was entitled to lenient treatment from its new ruler. A city that resisted could expect a harsh occupation. Mass executions were common in this type of situation. Reasoning of the late medieval established that since the city of Orl\u00e9ans had escalated the conflict, it forced the use of violence upon the English, justifying a conquering lord in exacting vengeance upon the citizens. The city's association with the Armagnac party made it unlikely to be spared if it fell.\nPreparations.\nState of the conflict.\nAfter the brief fallout over Hainaut in 1425\u201326, English and Burgundian forces renewed their alliance and offensive on the Dauphin's France in 1427. The Orl\u00e9anais region southwest of Paris was of key importance, not only for controlling the river Loire, but also to smoothly connect the English area of operations in the west and the Burgundian area of operations in the east. French forces had been largely ineffective before the Anglo-Burgundian onslaught until the siege of Montargis in late 1427, when they managed to successfully force it to be lifted. The relief of Montargis, the first effective French action in years, emboldened sporadic uprisings in the thinly-garrisoned English-occupied region of Maine to the west, threatening to undo recent English gains.\nHowever, the French failed to capitalize on the aftermath of Montargis, in large part because the French court was embroiled in an internal power struggle between the constable Arthur de Richemont and the chamberlain Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille, a new favourite of the Dauphin Charles. Of the French military leaders, John, the \"Bastard of Orl\u00e9ans\" (later called \"Dunois\"), La Hire and Jean de Xaintrailles were partisans of La Tr\u00e9moille, while Charles of Bourbon, Count of Clermont, the marshal Jean de Brosse and John Stewart of Darnley (head of the Scottish auxiliary forces), were lined up with the constable. The inner French conflict had reached such a point that their partisans were fighting each other in the open field by mid-1428.\nThe English took advantage of French paralysis to raise fresh reinforcements in England in early 1428, gathering a new force of 2,700 men (450 men-at-arms and 2,250 longbowmen), brought over by Thomas Montagu, 4th Earl of Salisbury, who was regarded as the most effective English commander of the time. These were bolstered by new levies raised in Normandy and Paris, and joined by auxiliaries from Burgundy and vassal domains in Picardie and Champagne, to a total strength possibly as great as 10,000.\nAt the council of war in the spring of 1428, the English regent John, Duke of Bedford determined the main thrust of English military campaigns would be towards the west, to stomp out the remaining Armagnac forces in the Maine and lay siege to Angers. The city of Orl\u00e9ans was not originally in this plan. Indeed, Bedford had secured a private deal with Dunois, whose attentions were focused on the Richemont-La Tr\u00e9moille conflict, then raging violently in the Berri. As Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans was at the time in English captivity, it would have been contrary to the customs of knightly war to seize the possessions of a prisoner. Bedford agreed to leave Orl\u00e9ans alone, but, for some reason, changed his mind shortly after the arrival of English reinforcements under Salisbury in July 1428. In a memorandum written in later years, Bedford expressed that the siege of Orl\u00e9ans \"was taken in hand, God knoweth by what advice\", suggesting it was probably Salisbury's idea, not his.\nSalisbury's approach.\nBetween July and October, the Earl of Salisbury swept through the countryside southwest of Paris \u2013 recovering Nogent-le-Roi, Rambouillet and the area around Chartres. Then, rather than continuing southwest to Angers, Salisbury turned abruptly southeast towards Orl\u00e9ans instead. Pressing towards the Loire, Salisbury seized Le Puiset and Janville (with some difficulty) in August. From there, rather than descending directly on Orl\u00e9ans from the north, Salisbury skipped over the city to seize the countryside west of it. He reached the river Loire at Meung-sur-Loire, which he promptly seized (a detachment of his men crossed the river then to plunder the abbey of Cl\u00e9ry). He pressed a little downriver, in the direction of Blois, to take the bridge and castle of Beaugency. Salisbury crossed the Loire at the point, and turned up to approach Orl\u00e9ans from the south. He arrived at Olivet, just one mile south of Orl\u00e9ans, on 7 October. In the meantime, an English detachment, under John de la Pole, brother of the Earl of Suffolk, had been sent to seize the regions upriver, east of Orl\u00e9ans: Jargeau fell on 5 October, Ch\u00e2teauneuf-sur-Loire immediately after, while further upriver, the Burgundians took Sully-sur-Loire. Orl\u00e9ans was cut off and surrounded.\nManning the defenses of Orl\u00e9ans, John of Dunois had watched the tightening English noose and took care to prepare the city for siege. Dunois correctly anticipated that the English would aim for the bridge, nearly one quarter mile (400\u00a0m) long, that led from the south shore of the Loire into the centre of the city of Orl\u00e9ans on the north shore. The bridge passed over the riverine island of St. Antoine, an optimal location for Salisbury to position English cannon within range of Orl\u00e9ans city centre. At the southern end of the bridge was a turreted gatehouse, \"Les Tourelles\", which stood in the river, connected by a drawbridge to the southern bank. Dunois rapidly erected a large earthwork bulwark (\"Boulevart\") on the south shore itself, which he packed with the bulk of his troops, thus creating a large fortified complex to protect the bridge. Just across from the Boulevart was an Augustinian friary, which could be used as a flanking firing position on any approach to the bridge, although it seems Dunois decided not to make use of it. On his orders, the southern suburbs of Orl\u00e9ans were evacuated and all structures leveled to prevent giving the English cover.\nEarly stages of the siege.\nAssault on the Tourelles.\nThe siege of Orl\u00e9ans formally began on 12 October 1428, and initiated with an artillery bombardment that began on 17 October. The English assaulted the Boulevart on 21 October, but the assaulters were held back by French missile fire, rope nets, scalding oil, hot coals and quicklime. The English decided against a new frontal attack, and set about mining the bulwark. The French countermined, fired the pit props and fell back to the Tourelles on 23 October. But the Tourelles itself was taken by storm the next day, 24 October. The departing French blew up some of the bridge arches to prevent a direct pursuit.\nWith the fall of the Tourelles, Orl\u00e9ans seemed doomed. But the timely arrival of the Marshal de Boussac with sizeable French reinforcements prevented the English from repairing and crossing the bridge and seizing Orl\u00e9ans immediately. The English suffered another setback two days later, when the Earl of Salisbury was struck in the face by debris kicked up in cannon fire while supervising the installation of the Tourelles. English operations were suspended while Salisbury was carried off to Meung to recover, but after lingering for about a week, he died of his injuries.\nThe investment.\nThe lull in English operations following Salisbury's injury and death gave the citizens of Orl\u00e9ans time to knock out the remaining arches of the bridge on their end, disabling the possibility of a quick repair and direct assault. The new siege commander appointed by Bedford in mid-November, William de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk resolved on surrounding the city and starving it into submission. He did not have enough men to invest the city with continuous trenchlines, so he set up a series of outworks, (\"bastides\"). Over the next few months, seven strongholds were set up on the north bank, and four on the south bank, with the small riverine isle of Charlemagne (west of Orl\u00e9ans) commanding the bridges connecting the two banks.\nIn the winter, a Burgundian force numbering about 1,500 men arrived to support the English besiegers.\nThe establishment of the outworks was not without difficulty. The French garrison sallied out repeatedly to harass the builders, and systematically destroyed other buildings (notably, all the churches) in the suburbs to prevent them serving as shelter for the English during the winter months. By the Spring of 1429, the English outworks covered only the south and west of the city, with the northeast basically left open (nonetheless swarming with English patrols). Sizeable contingents of French men-at-arms could push aside the patrols and move in and out of the city, but the entry of any lighter-escorted provisions and supplies was firmly blocked, there and further afield.\nOn the south bank, the English center was the bridge complex, composed of the Tourelles-Boulevart and the now-fortified Augustines. Guarding the approach to the bridge from the east was the bastille of St. Jean-le-Blanc, while to the west of the bridge complex was the bastille of Champ de St. Priv\u00e9. St. Priv\u00e9 also guarded the bridge to the island of Charlemagne (which had another bastille). On the north bank of the Loire, on the other side of Charlemagne bridge, was the bastille of St. Laurent, the largest English bulwark and the nerve center of English operations. Above that were a series of smaller outworks, in order: the bastille de la Croiz Boisse, the bastille des Douze Pierres (nicknamed \"London\"), the bastille de Pressoir Aps (nicknamed \"Rouen\") and, just north of the city, the bastille de St. Pouair (nicknamed \"Paris\"), all on top of the main roads. Then came the great northeastern gap, although its back was mostly covered by thick forest of the Bois d'Orl\u00e9ans. Finally, some 2\u00a0km east of the city, on the north bank, there was the isolated bastille of St. Loup.\nOrl\u00e9ans's position seemed gloomy. Although the French still held isolated citadels like Montargis to the northeast and Gien upriver, any relief would have to come from Blois, to the southwest, exactly where the English had concentrated their forces. Provisions convoys had to follow dangerous circuitous routes swinging around to reach the city from the northeast. Few made it through, and the city soon began to feel the pinch. Should Orl\u00e9ans fall, it would effectively make the recovery of the northern half of France all but impossible, and prove fatal to the Dauphin Charles's bid for the crown. When the French Estates met at Chinon in September 1428, they pressed the Dauphin to make peace with Philip III of Burgundy \"at any price\".\nBattle of the Herrings.\nThe threat to Orl\u00e9ans had prompted the partisans of Richemont and La Tr\u00e9moille to make a quick temporary truce in October 1428. In early 1429, Charles de Bourbon, Count of Clermont assembled a French-Scottish force in Blois for the relief of Orl\u00e9ans. Hearing of the dispatch of an English supply convoy from Paris, under the command of Sir John Fastolf for the English siege troops, Clermont decided to take a detour to intercept it. He was joined by a force from Orl\u00e9ans under John of Dunois, which had managed to slip past the English lines. The forces made junction at Janville and attacked the English convoy at Rouvray on 12 February, in an encounter known as the Battle of the Herrings, on account of the convoy being laden with a large supply of fish for the forthcoming Lenten season.\nThe English, aware of their approach, formed a wagon fort with the supply wagons, lining the circumference with bowmen. Clermont ordered the French to hold back, and let their cannon do the damage. But the Scottish regiments, led by John Stewart of Darnley, dissatisfied with the missile duel, decided to move in. The French lines hesitated, uncertain of whether to follow or remain back as ordered. Seeing the French immobilized or only timidly following, the English sensed an opportunity. The English cavalry burst out of the wagon fort, overwhelmed the isolated Scots, and threw back the hesitant French. Disorder and panic set in, and the French fell into retreat. Stewart of Darnley was killed, John of Dunois wounded. Fastolf brought the supplies in triumph to the English soldiers at Orl\u00e9ans three days later.\nThe defeat at Rouvray was disastrous for French morale. Bickering and recriminations immediately followed as Clermont and Dunois blamed each other for the disaster, reopening the fissures between the Richemont and La Tremoille parties. Clermont, disgusted, quit the field and retired to his estates, refusing to participate further. Once again, the Dauphin Charles was advised to sue for peace with Burgundy and should that fail, to consider abdicating and retiring to the Dauphin\u00e9, perhaps even going into exile in Scotland.\nSurrender proposal.\nIn March, John of Dunois made what he hoped was an irresistible offer to Philip III of Burgundy, offering to turn Orl\u00e9ans over to him, to hold as a neutral territory on behalf of his captive half-brother Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. A group of nobles and bourgeois from the city went to Philip to try to make him persuade the Duke of Bedford to lift the siege so that Orl\u00e9ans could surrender to Burgundy instead. The specific terms of the offer made are outlined in the letter by a contemporary merchant. Burgundy would be able to appoint the city's governors on behalf of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, half the city's taxes would go to the English, the other half would go for the ransom of the imprisoned duke. A contribution of 10,000 gold crowns was to be made to Bedford for war expenses, and the English would gain military access through Orl\u00e9ans, all in return for lifting the siege and handing the city to the Burgundians.\nThe agreement would have given the English the chance to pass through Orl\u00e9ans and strike into Bourges, the administrative capital of the Dauphin, which had been the primary motivator for the siege itself. Burgundy hurried to Paris in early April to persuade the English regent John of Bedford to take the offer. But Bedford, certain Orl\u00e9ans was on the verge of falling, refused to surrender his prize. The disappointed Philip withdrew his Burgundian auxiliaries from the English siege in a huff. The Burgundian contingent left on 17 April 1429, which left the English with an extremely small army to prosecute the siege. The decision proved to be a lost opportunity, and a terrible mistake in the long run for the English.\nJoan's arrival at Orl\u00e9ans.\nIt was on the very day of the Battle of the Herrings that a young French peasant girl, Joan of Arc, was meeting with Robert de Baudricourt, the \"Dauphinois\" captain of Vaucouleurs, trying to explain to the skeptical captain her divinely-ordained mission to rescue the Dauphin Charles and deliver him to his royal coronation at Reims. She had met and been rebuffed by Baudricourt twice before, but apparently this time he assented and arranged to escort her to the Dauphin's court in Chinon. According to the \"Chronique de la Pucelle\", at this meeting with Baudricourt, Joan disclosed that the Dauphin's forces had suffered a great reversal near Orl\u00e9ans that day, and if she were not sent to him soon, there would be others. Accordingly, when news of the defeat at Rouvray reached Vaucouleurs, Baudricourt became convinced of the girl's prescience and agreed to escort her. Whatever the truth of the story \u2013 and it is not accepted by all authorities \u2013 Joan left Vaucouleurs on 23 February for Chinon.\nFor years, vague prophecies had been circulating in France concerning an armored maiden who would rescue France. Many of these prophecies foretold that the armored maiden would come from the borders of Lorraine, where Domr\u00e9my, Joan's birthplace, is located. As a result, when word reached the besieged citizens of Orl\u00e9ans concerning Joan's journey to see the Dauphin, expectations and hopes were high.\nEscorted by several of Baudricourt's soldiers, Joan arrived in Chinon on 6 March 1429 and met with the skeptical La Tr\u00e9moille. On 9 March she finally met the Dauphin Charles, although it would be a few days more before she had a private meeting where the Dauphin was finally convinced of her \"powers\" (or at least, her usefulness). Nonetheless, he insisted she first proceed to Poitiers to be examined by church authorities. With the clerical verdict that she posed no harm and could be safely taken on, Dauphin Charles finally accepted her services on 22 March. She was provided with a suit of plate armor, a banner, a pageboy and heralds.\nJoan's first mission was to join a convoy assembling at Blois, under the command of Marshal Jean de La Brosse, Lord of Boussac bringing supplies to Orl\u00e9ans. It was from Blois that Joan dispatched her famous missives to the English siege commanders, calling herself \"the Maiden\" (\"La Pucelle\"), and ordering them, in the name of God, to \"Begone, or I will make you go\".\nThe relief convoy, escorted by some 400\u2013500 soldiers, finally left Blois on 27 or 28 April, in nearly religious processional array. Joan had insisted on approaching Orl\u00e9ans from the north (through the Beauce region), where English forces were concentrated, intent on fighting them immediately. But the commanders decided to take the convoy in a circuitous route around the south (through the Sologne region) without telling Joan, reaching the south bank of the Loire at Rully (near Ch\u00e9cy), some four miles east of the city. Orl\u00e9ans' commander, Jean de Dunois, came out to meet them across the river. Joan was indignant at the deception and ordered an immediate attack on St. Jean-le-Blanc, the nearest English bastille on the south bank. But Dunois, supported by the Marshals, protested and with some effort, finally prevailed on her to allow the city to be resupplied before any assaults on anything. The provisions convoy approached the landing of Port Saint-Loup, across the river from the English bastille of Saint-Loup on the north bank. While French skirmishers kept the English garrison of Saint-Loup contained, a fleet of boats from Orl\u00e9ans sailed down to the landing to pick up the supplies, Joan and 200 soldiers. One of Joan's reputed miracles was said to have taken place here: the wind which had brought the boats upriver suddenly reversed itself, allowing them to sail back to Orl\u00e9ans smoothly under the cover of darkness. Joan of Arc entered Orl\u00e9ans in triumph on 29 April around 8:00 PM, to much rejoicing. The rest of the convoy returned to Blois.\nLifting the siege.\nOver the next couple of days, to boost morale, Joan periodically toured the streets of Orl\u00e9ans, distributing food to the people and salaries to the garrison. Joan of Arc also sent out messengers to the English bastions demanding their departure, which the English commanders greeted with jeers. Some even threatened to kill the messengers as \"emissaries of a witch\".\nThe \"Journal du siege d'Orl\u00e9ans\", as quoted in Pernoud, reports several discussions during the course of the following week between Joan and Jean de Dunois, the illegitimate half-brother of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans and the chief leader directing the city's defense on behalf of the captive duke.\nBelieving the garrison too small for any action, on 1 May Dunois left the city in the hands of La Hire and made his way personally to Blois to arrange for reinforcements. During this interlude, Joan went outside the city walls and surveyed all of the English fortifications personally, at one point exchanging words with the English commander William Glasdale.\nOn 3 May Dunois's reinforcement convoy left Blois to head for Orl\u00e9ans. At the same time, other troop convoys set out from Montargis and Gien in the direction of Orl\u00e9ans. Dunois's military convoy arrived via the Beauce district, on the north bank of the river, in the early morning of 4 May, in full view of the English garrison at St. Laurent. The English declined to challenge the convoy's entry on account of its strength. Joan rode out to escort it in.\nAssault on St. Loup.\nAt noon that day, 4 May 1429, apparently to secure the entry of more provisions convoys, which had taken the usual circuitous route via the east, Dunois launched an attack on the easterly English bastille of St. Loup together with the Montargis-Gien troops. Joan nearly missed out on it, having been napping when the assault began, but she hurried to join in. The English garrison of 400 was heavily outnumbered by the 1,500 French attackers. Hoping to divert the French away, the English commander, Lord John Talbot, launched an attack from St. Pouair, on the northern end of Orl\u00e9ans, but it was held back by a French sortie. After a few hours, St. Loup fell, with some 140 English killed and 40 prisoners taken. Some of the English defenders of St. Loup were captured in the ruins of a nearby church, their lives spared at Joan's request. Hearing that St. Loup had fallen, Talbot retired the northern assault.\nAssault on the Augustines.\nThe next day, 5 May, was Ascension Day, and Joan urged an attack on the largest English outwork, the bastille of St. Laurent to the west. But the French captains, knowing its strength and that their men needed rest, prevailed on her to allow them to honor the feast-day in peace. Overnight, in a war council, it was decided that the best course of action was to clear the English bastions on the south bank, where the English were weakest.\nThe operation began in the early morning of 6 May. The citizens of Orl\u00e9ans, inspired by Joan of Arc, raised urban militias on her behalf and showed up at the gates, much to the distress of the professional commanders. Nonetheless, Joan prevailed upon the professionals to allow the militia to join. The French crossed the river from Orl\u00e9ans on boats and barges and landed on the island of St. Aignan, crossing over to the south bank via a makeshift pontoon bridge, landing on the stretch between the bridge complex and the bastille of St. Jean-le-Blanc. That plan had been to cut off and take St. Jean-le-Blanc from the west, but the English garrison commander, William Glasdale, sensing the intent of the French operation, had already hurriedly destroyed the St. Jean-le-Blanc outwork and concentrated his troops in the central Boulevart-Tourelles-Augustines complex.\nBefore the French had properly disembarked on the south bank, La Hire reportedly launched a precipitous attack on the strongpoint of the Boulevart (an outlying fortification to the south of Les Tourelles). This nearly turned into a disaster, as the assault was exposed on the flanks to English fire from the Augustines. The assault broke off when there were cries that the English garrison of the bastille of St. Priv\u00e9 further west was rushing upriver to reinforce Glasdale and cut them off. Panic set in, and the French attackers retreated from the Boulevart back to the landing grounds, dragging Joan back with them. Seeing the \"witch\" on the run and the \"spell\" broken, Glasdale's garrison burst out to give chase, but according to legend, Joan turned around on them alone, raised her holy standard and cried out \"Au Nom De Dieu\" (\"In the name of God\"), which reportedly was sufficient to impress the English to halt their pursuit and return to the Boulevart. The fleeing French troops turned around and rallied to her.\nFrench commanders then launched an assault against the fortified monastery of \"Les Augustins\", which was finally taken just before nightfall.\nWith the Augustins in French hands, Glasdale's garrison was blockaded in the Tourelles complex. That same night, what remained of the English garrison at St. Priv\u00e9 evacuated their outwork and went north of the river to join their comrades in St. Laurent. Glasdale was isolated, but he could count on a strong and well-ensconced English garrison of 700\u2013800 troops.\nAssault on the Tourelles.\nJoan had been wounded in the foot by stepping on a metal spike during the assault on the Augustins, and was taken back to Orl\u00e9ans overnight to recover. As a result, she did not participate in the evening war council. The next morning, 7 May, she was asked to sit out the final assault on the Boulevart-Tourelles, but she refused and roused to join the French camp on the south bank, much to the joy of the people of Orl\u00e9ans. The citizens raised more levies on her behalf and set about repairing the bridge with beams to enable a two-sided attack on the complex. Artillery was positioned on the island of Saint-Antoine.\nEarly in the morning, Joan was struck down while standing in the trench to the south of Les Tourelles, by a longbow arrow between the neck and left shoulder and was hurriedly taken away. Rumors of her death bolstered the English defenders and faltered French morale. But, according to eyewitnesses, she returned later during the evening and told the soldiers that a final assault would carry the fortress. Joan's confessor/chaplain, Jean Pasquerel, later stated that Joan herself had some type of premonition or foreknowledge of her wound, stating the day before the attack that \"tomorrow blood will flow from my body above my breast.\" Further assaults against Les Tourelles during the day were beaten back. As evening was approaching, Jean de Dunois had decided to leave the final assault for the next day. Informed of the decision, Joan went off for a period of quiet prayer, then returned to the area south of Les Tourelles, telling the troops that when her banner touched the fortress wall the place would be theirs. When one soldier shouted \"It's touching! (the wall)\", Joan replied \"Tout est vostre \u2013 et y entrez!\" (\"All is yours, \u2013 go in!\"). The French soldiery rushed in, swarming up the ladders into the fortification. \nThe French carried the day and forced the English out of the boulevart and back into the last redoubt of the Tourelles. But the drawbridge connecting them gave way, and Glasdale fell into the river and perished. The French pressed on to storm the Tourelles itself, from both sides (the bridge now repaired). The Tourelles, half-burning, was finally taken in the evening.\nEnglish losses were heavy. Counting other actions on the day (notably the interception of reinforcements rushed to the defense), the English had suffered nearly a thousand killed, and 600 prisoners. 200 French prisoners were found in the complex and released.\nEnd of the siege.\nWith the Tourelles complex taken, the English had lost the south bank of the Loire. There was little point of continuing the siege, as Orl\u00e9ans could now be easily re-supplied indefinitely.\nOn the morning of 8 May the English troops on the north bank, under the command of the Earl of Suffolk and Lord John Talbot, demolished their outworks and assembled in battle array in the field near St. Laurent. The French army under Dunois lined up before them. They stood facing each other immobile for about an hour, before the English withdrew from the field and marched off to join other English units in Meung, Beaugency and Jargeau. Some of the French commanders urged an attack to destroy the English army then and there. Joan of Arc reportedly forbade it, on account of it being Sunday.\nAftermath.\nThe English did not consider themselves beaten. Although they had suffered a setback and immense losses at Orl\u00e9ans itself, the surrounding perimeter of the Orleanais region \u2013 Beaugency, Meung, Janville, Jargeau \u2013 was still in their hands. Indeed, it was possible for the English to reorganize and resume the siege of Orl\u00e9ans itself soon after, this time perhaps with more success, as the bridge was now repaired, and thus more susceptible to being taken by assault. Suffolk's priority that day (8 May) was to salvage what remained of the English forces.\nThe French commanders realized as much, Joan less so. Leaving Orl\u00e9ans, she met the Dauphin Charles outside of Tours on 13 May to report her victory. She immediately called for a march northeast into Champagne, towards Reims, but the French commanders knew they had to first clear the English out of their dangerous positions on the Loire.\nThe Loire Campaign began a couple of weeks later, after a period of rest and reinforcement. Volunteers of men and supplies swelled the French army, eager to serve under Joan of Arc's banner. Even the ostracized constable Arthur de Richemont was eventually permitted to join the campaign. After a series of brief sieges and battles at Jargeau (12 June), Meung (15 June) and Beaugency (17 June), the Loire was back in French hands. An English reinforcement army rushing from Paris under John Talbot was defeated at the Battle of Patay shortly after (18 June), the first significant field victory for French forces in years. The English commanders, the Earl of Suffolk and Lord Talbot, were taken prisoner in this campaign. Only thereafter did the French feel safe enough to accede to Joan's request for a march on Reims.\nAfter some preparation, the march on Reims began from Gien on 29 June, the Dauphin Charles following Joan and the French army through the dangerous Burgundian-occupied territory of Champagne. Although Auxerre (1 July) closed its gates and refused them entry, Saint-Florentin (3 July) yielded, as did, after some resistance, Troyes (11 July) and Ch\u00e2lons-sur-Marne (15 July). They reached Reims the next day and the Dauphin Charles, with Joan at his side, was finally consecrated as King Charles VII of France on 17 July 1429.\nLegacy.\nThe city of Orl\u00e9ans commemorates the lifting of the siege with an annual festival, including both modern and medieval elements and a woman representing Joan of Arc in full armor atop a horse. On 8 May Orl\u00e9ans simultaneously celebrates the lifting of the siege and V-E Day (Victory in Europe, the day that Nazi Germany surrendered to the Allies to end World War II in Europe.)\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "60986", "revid": "237572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60986", "title": "1958 FIFA World Cup", "text": "Association football tournament in Sweden\nInternational football competition\nThe 1958 FIFA World Cup was the 6th FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial football tournament for men's senior national teams. It was played in Sweden from 8 to 29 June 1958. It is currently the only FIFA World Cup to be hosted in a Nordic country.\nBrazil beat Sweden 5\u20132 in the final in Solna, Stockholm, to claim their first title, having beaten France in the semi-final and Wales in the quarter-final. The tournament also marked the arrival of a then 17-year-old Pel\u00e9 on the world stage, who scored in all three of Brazil's knockout games.\nThis was the first appearance of Wales at the FIFA World Cup. They would not qualify for another until 64 years later. This tournament also marked the debuts of Northern Ireland, as well as the Soviet Union. Defending champions West Germany were eliminated by runners-up Sweden and would lose to France in a third place match.\nHost selection.\nArgentina, Chile, Mexico, and Sweden expressed interest in hosting the tournament. Swedish delegates lobbied other countries at the FIFA Congress held in Rio de Janeiro around the opening of the 1950 World Cup finals. Sweden was awarded the 1958 tournament unopposed on 23 June 1950.\nQualification.\nThe hosts (Sweden) and the defending champions (West Germany) qualified automatically. Of the remaining 14 places, nine were allocated to Europe, three to South America, one to North/Central America, and one to Asia/Africa.\nAside from the main European zone matches, Wales, which finished second in its group behind Czechoslovakia, was drawn into a play-off with Israel after Israel won its group by default because its three opponents, Turkey, Indonesia and Sudan, refused to play. FIFA had imposed a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match, something that had happened in several previous World Cups. Wales won the play-off and qualified for the first time. With Northern Ireland making its debut, and England and Scotland also qualifying, this World Cup was the only one to date to feature all four of the UK's home nations.\nThis World Cup also saw the entry and qualification of the Soviet Union for the first time, while Argentina appeared for the first time since 1934.\nOn 8 February 1958, in Solna, Lennart Hyland and Sven Jerring presented the results of the draw where the qualified teams were divided into four groups. Seeding was geographical rather than by team strength, with each group containing one western European team, one eastern European team, one of the four British teams that had qualified, and one from the Americas.\nList of qualified teams.\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFormat.\nThe format of the competition changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played each of the other teams in its group at least once, without extra time in the event of a draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points, then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third-placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal, then lots would have been drawn. By the time the competition began, these arrangements were still in discussion. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches, FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, stating that it was wrong to change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.\nThis was the first time that goal average was available to separate teams in a World Cup. It was used to separate the teams finishing first and second in one of the groups. However, all three playoffs finished with decisive results and so it was not needed to separate the teams involved in a tied playoff.\nAlmost all the matches kicked off simultaneously in each of the three rounds of the group phase, as did the quarter-finals and semi-finals. The exceptions were Sweden's three group matches, all of which were televised by Sveriges Radio; these started at other times so Swedes could attend other matches without missing their own team's. Apart from these, one match per round was televised, and relayed across Europe by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Many Swedes bought their first television for the World Cup.\nThe official ball was the \"Top-Star VM-bollen 1958\" model made by Sydsvenska L\u00e4der &amp; Remfabriks AB (aka \"Remmen\" or \"Sydl\u00e4der\") in \u00c4ngelholm. Four FIFA officials conducted a blind test to choose it from 102 candidates.\nSummary.\nIn Group 4, Pel\u00e9 and Garrincha did not play until the last of Brazil's group games, against the Soviet Union. Pel\u00e9 failed to score, but provided the assist to Vav\u00e1's second goal. Brazil won the game 2\u20130 (also thanks to an impressive exhibition of dribbling prowess by Garrincha) and the group by two points. Previously, they had drawn 0\u20130 with England in what was the first ever goalless game in World Cup history. Eventually, the Soviet Union and England went to a playoff game, in which Anatoli Ilyin scored in the 67th minute to knock England out, while Austria had already been eliminated. The English side had been weakened by the Munich air disaster earlier in the year, which killed three internationals on the books of Manchester United, including England's young star Duncan Edwards.\nPlayoffs were also needed in Group 1 (Northern Ireland beat Czechoslovakia to join the defending champions West Germany in the quarter-finals) and Group 3 (Wales topped Hungary to advance with hosts Sweden). Hungary had become a spent force after their appearance in the final of the previous tournament. They had lost their best players two years before, when they fled in the wake of the failed uprising against the communist regime. In a rather restrictive sense, from the 1954 team, only goalkeeper Gyula Grosics, defender Jozsef Bozsik and forward N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti remained.\nIn Group 2, Scotland faced Yugoslavia, Paraguay, and France. France topped the group, with Just Fontaine netting six goals. Yugoslavia finished second, while Scotland came in last.\nThe quarter-finals saw France's Just Fontaine continue in similar form as in the group stage, managing another two goals as France triumphed over Northern Ireland. West Germany's Helmut Rahn put them into the semi-finals with a single goal against Yugoslavia, while Sweden went through at the expense of USSR. The other game in the quarter-finals saw Pel\u00e9 score the only goal for Brazil against Wales.\nIn the semi-finals, Sweden continued their strong run as they defeated West Germany 3\u20131 in a vicious game that saw the German player Erich Juskowiak sent off (the first ever German player to be sent off in an international game) and German veteran forward Fritz Walter injured, which further weakened the German team (substitutes were first allowed in the 1970 FIFA World Cup).\nIn the other semi-final, Brazil and France were tied 1\u20131 for much of the first half. However, 36 minutes into the game, French captain and most experienced defender Robert Jonquet suffered a broken leg in a clash with Vav\u00e1, and France was down to ten men for the rest of the game, (substitutions were not allowed back then). Brazil dominated the rest of the match, as a Pel\u00e9 hat-trick gave them a 5\u20132 victory. Fontaine of France added one goal to his impressive tally.\nThe third-place match saw Fontaine score four more goals as France defeated West Germany 6\u20133. This brought his total to 13 goals in one competition, a record that still stands.\nFinal.\nThe final was played in Solna, in the R\u00e5sunda Stadium; 50,000 people watched as the Brazilians went a goal down after four minutes. However, Vav\u00e1 equalised shortly afterwards and then put them a goal ahead before half time. In the second half, Pel\u00e9 outshone everyone, notching two goals, including the first one where he lobbed the ball over Bengt Gustavsson then followed it with a precise volley shot. Zagallo added a goal in between, and Sweden managed a consolation goal.\nThe Final saw many records made in World Cup history that still stand as of 2018[ [update]]. At age 17, Pel\u00e9 simultaneously became the youngest player to participate in, score, and win a World Cup final. Conversely, Nils Liedholm became the oldest player to score in a World Cup Final at 35 years 263 days. This final had the highest number of goals scored by a winning team (5), the highest number of total goals scored (7), and together with the 1970 and 1998 finals shares the highest goal margin of difference (3); Brazil played in all those three finals.\nThe game is also notable for many firsts in FIFA World Cup. With the exception of the 1950 FIFA World Cup final group stage, this marked the first time that a World Cup host reached the final without winning it. Additionally, the match marked the first time two nations from different continents (Europe and South America) met in a World Cup final. It also marks the first and only World Cup hosted in Europe not won by a European team, a feat mirrored in 2014 where a World Cup hosted in the Americas was not won by a team from the Americas for the first time, with Germany beating Argentina 1\u20130 at the final.\nVenues.\nA total of twelve cities throughout the central and southern parts of Sweden hosted the tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000. If Denmark had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the Idr\u00e6tsparken in Copenhagen for Denmark's group matches. The Idr\u00e6tsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification. When doubts arose about whether funding would be forthcoming for rebuilding the Ullevi and Malm\u00f6 Stadion, the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and Oslo as contingency measures.\nThe R\u00e5sunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands. Organising committee chairman Holger Berg\u00e9rus mortgaged his house to pay for this. The new Malm\u00f6 Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malm\u00f6 Stadion at a new site. The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup. The Social Democratic municipal government refused to pay for this until the organisers threatened to select Folkungavallen in Link\u00f6ping instead. At the Rimnersvallen, a stand from the smaller Oddevallen stadium was moved to Rimnersvallen for the World Cup. The crowd at Brazil v. Austria was estimated at 21,000, with more looking in from the adjoining hillside. The most used stadium was the R\u00e5sunda Stadium in Stockholm, which hosted 8 matches, including the final, followed by the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg (the biggest stadium used during the tournament), which hosted 7 matches. The Malm\u00f6 Stadium hosted 4 matches, Norrk\u00f6ping hosted 3 matches; Bor\u00e5s, Halmstad, Helsingborg, V\u00e4ster\u00e5s, and Sandviken hosted 2 matches each, and \u00d6rebro, Eskilstuna, and Uddevalla each hosted 1 match.\nMatch officials.\n22 match officials were assigned to the tournament to serve as referees and assistant referees.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEurope\nSouth America\nSeeding.\nThere was no seeding for this World Cup; the teams were instead allocated geographically into four pots chosen by the FIFA Organising Committee. Teams were drawn from each pot into Groups 1\u20134 in numerical order.\nPreventing the defending champions from meeting the hosts in the group stage, either by seeding or predetermined group positions, was a practiced tradition throughout the history of the FIFA World Cup, with 1934 and 1954 being the only two exceptions. This tradition continued in 1958, with West Germany as defending champion and host nation Sweden both being allocated into the same \"Western European Pot\", which kept them from meeting in the group stage.\nThe geographical basis of the seeding attracted criticism, especially from Austria, who were drawn against the teams considered strongest in each of the other three pots.\nSquads.\nFor a list of all squads that appeared in the final tournament, see \"1958 FIFA World Cup squads\".\nGroup stage.\nGroup 1.\nThe West Germans, surprise world champions four years before, were still very strong, and fielded an exciting young forward in Uwe Seeler. The Germans had to contend with a real powerhouse in Argentina's team, competing for the first time since 1934. In fact, some experts thought Argentina had a very realistic chance of reaching the semi-finals or even winning the World Cup this time.\nCzechoslovakia was a fairly strong team with a rich football tradition, and was considered to be no walkover for the West Germans or the Argentinians. \nNobody expected much from tiny newcomers Northern Ireland. But the Northern Irish had already shown that they could be a danger by knocking out double world champions Italy in World Cup qualifying.\nIn the end, the Northern Irish pulled off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup Finals history by qualifying for the quarter-finals, beating Czechoslovakia in a play-off. \nArgentina experienced a horrible blow finishing last in the group with a \u22125 goal differential. Arriving home, the Argentinian team met the wrath of several thousand angry football fans at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires.\nGroup 2.\nThe second group saw the largest number of goals scored in a single group in the 1958 World Cup, with 31 goals in total (~5.16 goals per game). Just Fontaine of France scored 6 of his 13 goals in the tournament, making him the tournament's top scorer going into the quarter-finals.\nThe teams in this group had not seen significant success in past World Cups. France, even as hosts in 1938, did not secure notable achievements; Yugoslavia failed to match their 1930 semi-final run, and both Paraguay and Scotland entered the tournament as underdogs.\nFrance won the group ahead of Yugoslavia and would go on to finish third.\nGroup 3.\nThe Swedish hosts could count themselves lucky in ending up in a rather weak group, which they proceeded to win fairly easily with their powerful, workmanlike football. The group included Hungary which had been considered by far the best team in the world some years ago, although the Hungarians could not beat West Germany in the final of the World Cup in 1954. But the Hungarian team had been dealt a blow by the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 after which star players like S\u00e1ndor Kocsis and Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s left their homeland. Striker N\u00e1ndor Hidegkuti was still playing, but he was by now 36 years old and nowhere near his peak form.\nIn spite of Hungary's recent travails, they were still considered a strong side and were expected to advance from their group. The success of Wales was a surprise but they drew all their group games and beat the Hungarians in a play-off match to follow Sweden into the knock-out stage. Wales played Brazil in the quarter-finals and became the recipient of young Pel\u00e9's first World Cup goal.\nThe 1\u20131 draw between Wales and Mexico was the first point scored by Mexico in a World Cup, having lost all eight matches in their previous three appearances in the World Cup, as well as their first match in this group against Sweden. To date, no other team has ever lost nine consecutive games in the World Cup.\nThe match between Hungary and Wales in Sandviken became the northernmost World Cup match in history.\nGroup 4.\nDespite setbacks in earlier tournaments, Brazil was still regarded as a formidable force, a reputation they would go on to justify. The Soviet Union, having clinched the Olympic gold in 1956, and Austria, securing the bronze medal at the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, were also strong contenders. England, despite being weakened by the tragic Munich air disaster that claimed several players, remained a team of considerable strength.\nIn the end, this group had the highest average attendance (31,320 per game), even higher than Group 3 with the host nation, Sweden.\nThe quality of the football in this group did not quite live up to expectations, however. Only 15 goals were scored in the whole group, only one more than Group 3. And when England and Brazil drew 0\u20130, it was the first time in World Cup history that a game ended goalless. It was also the first time Brazil had failed to score in a World Cup finals match.\nBrazil won the group without conceding a single goal. The teenage Pel\u00e9 played Brazil's last game against the Soviet Union. He did not score but drew wild reviews for his play. The Soviet Union, in their first World Cup, took second place.\nGoalscorers.\nWith 13 goals, Just Fontaine was the top scorer in the tournament. As of 2022[ [update]], no player has ever scored more goals in a single FIFA World Cup Final stage. In total, 126 goals were scored by 60 players, with none of them credited as an own goal.\n13 goals\n6 goals\n5 goals\n4 goals\n3 goals\n2 goals\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n1 goal\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAll-Star Team.\nThe team of the tournament voted by journalists was as follows: \nAlthough Just Fontaine got more votes than any other forward, they were split between the left and right inside forward positions.

It received its royal charter in 1909, although it can trace its roots to a Merchant Venturers' school founded in 1595 and University College, Bristol, which had been in existence since 1876. Bristol Medical School, founded in 1833, was merged with the University College in 1893, and later became the university's school of medicine.\nThe university is organised into three academic faculties composed of multiple schools and departments running over 200 undergraduate courses, largely in the Tyndall's Park area of the city. It had a total income of \u00a31.06 billion in 2023\u201324, of which \u00a3294.1 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3768.7 million.&lt;ref name=\"Bristol Financial Statement 23/24\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is the largest independent employer in Bristol. Current academics include 23 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 13 fellows of the British Academy, 43 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering and 48 fellows of the Royal Society. The University of Bristol's alumni and faculty include 13 Nobel laureates.\nBristol is a member of the Russell Group of research-intensive British universities, the European-wide Coimbra Group and the Worldwide Universities Network, of which the university's previous vice-chancellor, Eric Thomas, was chairman from 2005 to 2007. In addition, the university holds an Erasmus Charter, sending more than 500 students per year to partner institutions in Europe. It has an average of 6.4 (Sciences faculty) to 13.1 (Medicine &amp; Dentistry Faculty) applicants for each undergraduate place.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe earliest antecedent of the university was the engineering department of the Merchant Venturers' Technical College (founded as a school as early as 1595) which became the engineering faculty of Bristol University. The university was also preceded by Bristol Medical School (1833) and University College, Bristol, founded in 1876, where its first lecture was attended by only 99 students.\nThe university was able to apply for a royal charter due to the financial support of the Wills and Fry families, who made their fortunes in tobacco plantations and chocolate respectively (while there was no funding from Edward Colston). A 2018 study commissioned by the university estimated 85% of the philanthropic funds used for the institution's foundation \"depended on the labour of enslaved people\".\nThe royal charter was gained in May 1909, with 288 undergraduates and 400 other students entering the university in October 1909. Henry Overton Wills III became its first chancellor. The University College was the first such institution in the country to admit women on the same basis as men. However, women were forbidden to take examinations in medicine until 1906.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;; \n \n \"&gt;\nThere shall be from henceforth for ever in Our said City of Bristol a University...\n King Edward VII, Charter of Incorporation of the University of Bristol, 4 December 1909\nSince the founding of the university itself in 1909, it has grown considerably and is now one of the largest employers in the local area, although it is smaller by student numbers than the nearby University of the West of England.\nEarly years.\nAfter the founding of the university college in 1876, government support began in 1889. Funding from mergers with the Bristol Medical School in 1893 and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in 1909, allowed the opening of a new medical school and an engineering school \u2013 two subjects that remain among the university's greatest strengths.\nIn 1908, gifts from the Fry and Wills families, particularly \u00a3100,000 from Henry Overton Wills III (\u00a36m in today's money), were provided to endow a university for Bristol and the West of England, provided that a royal charter could be obtained within two years. In December 1909, the king granted such a charter and erected the University of Bristol. Henry Wills became its first chancellor and Conwy Lloyd Morgan the first vice-chancellor. Wills died in 1911 and in tribute his sons George and Harry built the Wills Memorial Building, starting in 1913 and finally finishing in 1925. Today, it houses parts of the academic provision for earth sciences and law, and graduation ceremonies are held in its Great Hall. The Wills Memorial Building is a Grade II* listed building.\nIn 1920, George Wills bought the Victoria Rooms and endowed them to the university as a students' union.\nThe building now houses the Department of Music and is a Grade II* listed building.\nAt the point of foundation, the university was required to provide for the local community. This mission was behind the creation of the Department of Extra-Mural Adult Education in 1924 to provide courses to the local community. This mission continues today; a new admissions policy specifically caters to the \"BS\" postcode area of Bristol.\nAmong the famous names associated with Bristol in this early period is Paul Dirac, who graduated in 1921 with a degree in engineering, before obtaining a second degree in mathematics in 1923 from Cambridge. For his subsequent pioneering work on quantum mechanics, he was awarded the 1933 Nobel Prize in Physics. Later in the 1920s, the H. H. Wills Physics Laboratory was opened by Ernest Rutherford. It has since housed several Nobel Prize winners: Cecil Frank Powell (1950); Hans Albrecht Bethe (1967); and Nevill Francis Mott (1977). The laboratory stands on the same site today, close to the Bristol Grammar School and the city museum.\nWinston Churchill became the university's third chancellor in 1929, serving the university in that capacity until 1965. He succeeded Richard Haldane who had held the office from 1912 following the death of Henry Wills.\nDuring World War II, the Wills Memorial was bombed, destroying the Great Hall and the organ it housed, along with 7,000 books removed from King's College London for safe keeping. It has since been restored, complete with oak panelled walls and a new organ.\nPost-war development.\nIn 1946, the university established the first drama department in the country. In the same year, Bristol began offering special entrance exams and grants to aid the resettlement of servicemen returning home. Student numbers continued to increase, and the Faculty of Engineering eventually needed the new premises that were to become Queen's Building in 1955. This substantial building housed all of the university's engineers until 1996, when the electrical engineering and computer science departments moved over the road into the new Merchant Venturers' Building to make space for these rapidly expanding fields. Today, Queen's Building caters for most of the teaching needs of the faculty and provides academic space for the \"heavy\" engineering subjects (civil, mechanical, and aerospace).\nWith unprecedented growth in the 1960s, particularly in undergraduate numbers, the Students' Union eventually acquired larger premises in a new building in the Clifton area of the city, in 1965. This building was more spacious than the Victoria Rooms, which were now given over to the Department of Music. The University of Bristol Union provides many practice and performance rooms, some specialist rooms, as well as three bars: Bar 100, the Mandela (also known as AR2) and the Avon Gorge. Whilst spacious, the Union building is thought by many to be ugly and out of character compared to the architecture of the rest of the Clifton area, having been mentioned in a BBC poll to find the worst architectural eyesores in Britain. The university has proposed relocating the Union to a more central location as part of its development 'masterplan'. More recently, plans for redevelopment of the current building have been proposed.\nThe 1960s were a time of considerable student activism in the United Kingdom, and Bristol was no exception. In 1968, many students marched in support of the Anderson Report, which called for higher student grants. This discontent culminated in an 11-day sit-in at the Senate House (the administrative headquarters of the university). A series of chancellors and vice-chancellors led the university through these decades, with Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort taking over from Churchill as chancellor in 1965 before being succeeded by Dorothy Hodgkin in 1970 who spent the next 18 years in the office.\nAs the age of mass higher education dawned, Bristol continued to build its student numbers. The various undergraduate residences were repeatedly expanded and, more recently, some postgraduate residences have been constructed. These more recent ventures have been funded (and are run) by external companies in agreement with the university.\nOne of the few centres for deaf studies in the United Kingdom was established in Bristol in 1981, followed in 1988 by the Norah Fry Centre for research into learning difficulties. Also in 1988, and again in 2004, the Students' Union AGM voted to disaffiliate from the National Union of Students (NUS). On both occasions, however, the subsequent referendum of all students reversed that decision and Bristol remains affiliated to the NUS.\nIn 1988, Sir Jeremy Morse, then chairman of Lloyds Bank, became chancellor.\n21st century.\nAs the number of postgraduate students has grown (particularly the numbers pursuing taught master's degrees), there eventually became a need for separate representation on university bodies and the Postgraduate Union (PGU) was established in 2000. Universities are increasingly expected to exploit the intellectual property generated by their research activities and, in 2000, Bristol established the Research and Enterprise Division (RED) to further this cause (particularly for technology-based businesses). In 2001, the university signed a 25-year research funding deal with IP2IPO, an intellectual property commercialisation company. In 2007, research activities were expanded further with the opening of the Advanced Composites Centre for Innovation and Science (ACCIS) and The Bristol Institute for Public Affairs (BIPA).\nIn 2002, the university was involved in an argument over press intrusion after details of then-prime minister Tony Blair's son's application to university were published in national newspapers. In the same year, the university opened the new Centre for Sports, Exercise and Health in the heart of the university precinct. At a cost, local residents can also use the facilities.\nBrenda Hale, the first female Law Lord, became chancellor of the university in 2003. Paul Nurse succeeded Lady Hale as chancellor on 1 January 2017.\nExpansion of teaching and research activities continues. In 2004, the Faculty of Engineering completed work on the Bristol Laboratory for Advanced Dynamics Engineering (BLADE). This \u00a318.5m project is intended to further the study of dynamics and is the most advanced such facility in Europe. It was built as an extension to the Queen's Building and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2005.\nIn January 2005, the School of Chemistry was awarded \u00a34.5m by the Higher Education Funding Council for England to create Bristol ChemLabS: a Centre for Excellence in Teaching &amp; Learning (CETL), with an additional \u00a3350k announced for the capital part of the project in February 2006. Bristol ChemLabS stands for Bristol Chemical Laboratory Sciences; it is the only chemistry CETL in the UK.\nSeptember 2009 saw the opening of the university's Centre for Nanoscience and Quantum Information. This \u00a311 million building is known as the quietest building in the world and has other technologically sophisticated features such as self-cleaning glass. Advanced research into quantum computing, nanotechnology, materials and other disciplines are being undertaken in the building.\nThere is also a plan to significantly redevelop the centre of the University Precinct in the coming years. The first step began in September 2011, with the start of construction of a state-of-the-art Life Sciences building.\nIn 2018 while building work was underway in the Fry Building, the building caught fire.\nIn 2024 the university revised their emblem, removing the dolphin emblem because of its connection to the slave trader Edward Colston and adding an image of moving pages and a bookmark.\nIn 2025, BristolSEDS, a student society within the University, successfully hot-fired a 6 kilo-newton bi-propellant rocket engine, claiming the record for the highest thrust of an engine of this type designed by students in the UK.\nCampus.\nBuildings and sites.\nThe university does not have a main campus but is spread over a considerable geographic area. Most of its activities, however, are concentrated in the area of the city centre, referred to as the \"University Precinct\".\nSome of the University of Bristol's buildings date to its pre-charter days when it was University College Bristol. These buildings were designed by Charles Hansom, and suffered being built in stages due to financial pressure. The first large scale building project the University of Bristol undertook on gaining a charter was the Wills Memorial Building. Other notable buildings and sites include Royal Fort House, the University of Bristol Botanic Garden, many large Victorian houses which were converted for teaching in the Faculty of Arts, and the Victoria Rooms which house the Music Department and were designed by Charles Dyer. The tympanum of the building depicts a scene from \"The Advent of Morning\" designed by Jabez Tyley.\nGoldney gardens entered the property of the University of Bristol through George Wills who had hoped to build an all-male hall of residence there. This was prevented due to the moral objection of the then warden of Clifton Hill House who objected to the idea of male and female residences being in such close proximity. University records show that Miss Starvey was prepared to resign over the issue and that she had the support of the then Chancellor Conwy Lloyd Morgan. Eventually land was purchased in Stoke Bishop, allowing the building of what has been described as a \"quasi-Oxbridge\" hall, Wills Hall, to which was added the Dame Monica Wills Chapel by George Wills' widow after his death. When Goldney did become student accommodation in 1956, the flats were designed by Michael Grice who received an award from the Civic Trust for their design.\nBurwalls, a mansion house on the other side of the Avon Gorge, was used as a halls of residence in the past and was a home of Sir George Oatley. The building is now used to house the Centre for Continuing Education.\nMany of the more modern buildings, including Senate House and the newer parts of the HH Wills Physics Laboratory, were designed by Ralph Brentnall using funds from the University Grants Committee. He is also responsible for the extension to the Wills Memorial Building library which was completed to such standard that few now realise that is an extension to the original building.\nIn May 2022, the university announced the opening of the Gambling Harms and Research Centre (GHRC). The centre worth \u00a34 million aims to increase awareness and understanding of the dangers of gambling. The project was funded by the GambleAware charity, which chose the university for its history in researching gambling issues, and will integrate research from six facilities.\nPlanned expansion.\nIn November 2016, the university announced that it plans to build a \u00a3300 million Temple Quarter Campus for c. 5,000 students, next to Bristol Temple Meads railway station within Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone. The new campus, which will include a business school, digital research facilities and a student village, is expected to open in 2021. For the existing campus, there are plans to remodel Tyndall Avenue, pedestrianise the surrounding area and build a new library and resource hub.\nOrganisation and governance.\nIn common with most UK universities, Bristol is headed formally by the chancellor, currently Sir Paul Nurse and led on a day-to-day basis by the vice-chancellor, currently Professor Evelyn Welch, who is the academic leader and chief executive. There are four pro vice-chancellors and three ceremonial pro-chancellors. The chancellor may hold office for up to ten years and the pro-chancellors for up to three, unless the University Court determines otherwise, but the vice-chancellor and pro-vice-chancellors have no term limits. The vice-chancellor is supported by a deputy vice-chancellor.\nResponsibility for running the university is held at an executive level by the vice-chancellor, but the council is the only body that can recommend changes to the university's statutes and charter, with the exception of academic ordinances. These can only be made with the consent of the senate, the chief academic body in the university which also holds responsibility for teaching and learning, examinations and research and enterprise. The chancellor and pro chancellors are nominated by council and appointed formally by court, whose additional powers are now limited to these appointments and a few others, including some lay members of council. Finally, Convocation, the body of all staff, ceremonial officers and graduates of the university, returns 100 members to court and one member to council, but is otherwise principally a forum for discussion and to ensure graduates stay in touch with the university.\nThe university is made up of a number of schools and departments organised into three faculties:\nAcademic dress.\nThe university specifies a mix of Cambridge and Oxford academic dress. For the most part, it uses Oxford-style gowns and Cambridge-style hoods, which are required to be 'university red' (see the logo at the top of the page).\nFinances.\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Bristol had a total income of \u00a31.060\u00a0billion (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3902.2\u00a0million) and total expenditure of \u00a3768.7\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3807.5\u00a0million). Key sources of income included \u00a3459.9\u00a0million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3416.4\u00a0million), \u00a3119\u00a0million from funding body grants (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3127.7\u00a0million), \u00a3294.1\u00a0million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3203.3\u00a0million), \u00a316.5\u00a0million from investment income (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a313.6\u00a0million) and \u00a38.9\u00a0million from endowment donations (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a30.6\u00a0million).\nAt year end, Bristol had endowments of \u00a398.7\u00a0million (2023 \u2013 \u00a386.1\u00a0million) and total net assets of \u00a31.581\u00a0billion (2023 \u2013 \u00a31.256\u00a0billion). It holds the fifteenth-largest endowment of any university in the UK.\nLogo and arms.\nIn 2004, the university unveiled its new logo. The icons in the logo are the sun for the Wills family, the dolphin for Colston, the horse for Fry and the ship-and-castle from the medieval seal of the City of Bristol, as also used in the coat of arms. The shape of the whole logo represents the open book of learning. This logo has replaced the university arms shown, but the arms continue to be used where there is a specific historical or ceremonial requirement. The arms comprise:\n\"argent on a cross quadrate gules the arms of the City of Bristol between in pale and a sun in splendour (for Wills) and an open book proper, leaved and clasped or, and inscribed with the words Nisi quia Dominus, and in fesse to the sinister a dolphin embowed (for Colston), and to the dexter a horse courant (for Fry), both of the third.\"\nThe inscription on the book is the Latin opening of the 124th Psalm, \"If the Lord Himself had not (been on our side...)\". The latin motto granted with the Arms below the shields is Vim promovet insitam, from the fourth Ode of Horace's fourth book meaning '[Learning] promotes one's innate power'.\nAcademics.\nAdmissions.\nBristol had the 8th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2015, with new students averaging 485 UCAS points, equivalent to just above AAAaa in A-level grades. Competition for places is high with an average 7.7 applications per place according to the 2014 Sunday Times League Tables, making it the joint 11th most competitive university in the UK. The university gave offers of admission to 52.2% of its undergraduate applicants in 2022, the 17th lowest offer rate across the country.\nAccording to the 2017 \"Times\" and \"Sunday Times\" Good University Guide, approximately 40% of Bristol's undergraduates come from independent schools. In the 2016\u201317 academic year, the university had a domicile breakdown of 78:5:17 of UK:EU:non-EU students respectively with a female to male ratio of 55:45.\nRankings and reputation.\nThe University of Bristol ranks number 5 in the UK for research quality according to the most recent Research Excellence Framework assessment. Chemistry (1st), Physics (5th), Engineering (6th), Mathematical sciences (4th), Computer science and informatics (7th), Earth systems and environmental sciences (2nd), Biological sciences (8th), Geography and environmental studies (1st), Law (3rd), Economics and econometrics (7th), and Modern languages and linguistics (4th) are among the highly rated subjects. The Complete University Guide 2024 ranks Bristol 4th for the quality of its research. Bristol also ranks 5th for number of spin outs created and has the best business incubator in the world according to UBI Global.\nThe University of Bristol was the fourth most targeted university by the UK's top 100 employers, according to the Graduate Market in 2023 report produced by High Fliers. It was ranked joint 7th in the UK for graduate employability.\nInternationally, the 2024 QS World University Rankings placed Bristol at 55th overall in the world and 9th in the UK. The Times Higher Education World University Ranking placed Bristol at 76th globally and 9th in the UK in 2023. Another international ranking, the Shanghai Jiao Tong University Academic Ranking of World Universities, placed Bristol 88th globally and 8th in the UK in 2023.\nDegrees.\nBristol awards a range of academic degrees spanning bachelor's and master's degrees as well as junior doctorates and higher doctorates. The postnominals awarded are the degree abbreviations used commonly among British universities. The university is part of the Engineering Doctorate scheme, and awards the Eng. D. in systems engineering, engineering management, aerospace engineering and non-destructive evaluation.\nBristol notably does not award by title any bachelor's degrees in music, which is available for study but awarded BA (although it does award MMus and DMus), nor any degree in divinity, since divinity is not available for study (students of theology are awarded a BA). Similarly, the university does not award BLitt (Bachelor of Letters), although it does award both MLitt and DLitt. In regulations, the university does not name MD or DDS as higher doctorates, although they are in many universities as these degrees are normally accredited professional doctorates.\nThe degrees of DLitt, DSc, DEng, LLD and DMus, whilst having regulations specifying the grounds for award, are most often conferred as honorary degrees (\"in honoris causa\"). Those used most commonly are the DLitt, DSc and LLD, with the MA (and occasionally the MLitt) also sometimes conferred honorarily for distinction in the local area or within the university.\nPublishing and commercial activities.\nBristol University Press.\nBristol University Press is scholarly press based at University of Bristol. In 1996, the University of Bristol established Policy Press, an academic publisher based in the Faculty of Social Sciences and Law at the University of Bristol and specialising in the social sciences. In October 2016, Policy Press became an imprint of newly founded Bristol University Press.\nIt is not-for-profit university press which publishes 22 journals and 200 books a year in subjects including: Ageing and Gerontology, Business and Management, Criminology, Economics and Society, Environment and Sustainability, International Development, Law, Politics and International Relations, Science, Technology and Society, and Sociology. It achieved journal citation metrics with gains in Journal Impact Factors and improved results in Journal Citation Indicator, Scopus CiteScore and SJR.\nBristol is Open.\nBristol is Open, abbreviated as BiO, is a joint venture project between Bristol City Council and University of Bristol. It is for delivering research contributing to the development of a Smart City and deploying a city-scale open and programmable testbed for experimentation and digital innovation. The collaboration of two organisations started in April 2015 and ended in December 2019 with Bristol City Council taking full control of BiO's operations. It has completed many technical trials and experiments including open access to Wi-Fi as a reduction of the digital divide and development for Smart City technology.\nStudent life.\nStudents' Union.\nThe University of Bristol Students' Union (Bristol SU) located in Senate House and the Richmond Building on Queens Road is a founding member of the National Union of Students and is amongst the oldest students' unions in England. The union oversees three media outlets: UBTV, the Bristol University Radio Station (BURST) and the student newspaper \"Epigram\". There is also a local branch of \"The Tab\". The Union is responsible for representing students' academic interests through elections of student representatives and democratic events. The Union is also responsible for the organisation of the annual Welcome Fair, the co-ordination of Bristol Student Community Action, which organises volunteering projects in the local community, and the organisation of entertainment events and over 400 student groups, societies and clubs. Previous presidents have included Sue Lawley and former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit \u00d6pik. There is a separate union for postgraduate students, as well as an athletic union, which is a member of the British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport. In distinction to the \"blues\" awarded for sporting excellence at Oxford and Cambridge, Bristol's most successful athletes are awarded \"reds\".\nHalls of residence.\nAccommodation for students is primarily in the central precinct of the university and two areas of Bristol: Clifton and Stoke Bishop, known respectively as the West and North Villages.\nIn Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall on the edge of the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992.\nIn Clifton, Goldney Hall was built first in the early 18th century by the wealthy merchant Goldney family and eventually became part of the university in 1956. It is a popular location for filming, with \"The Chronicles of Narnia\", \"The House of Eliott\" and \"Truly, Madly, Deeply\", as well as episodes of \"Only Fools and Horses\" and \"Casualty\", being filmed there. The Grotto in the grounds is a Grade I listed building. Clifton Hill House is another Grade I listed building now used as student accommodation in Clifton. The original building was constructed between 1745 and 1750 by Isaac Ware, and has been used by the university since its earliest days in 1909. Manor Hall comprises five separate buildings, the principal of which was erected from 1927 to 1932 to the design of George Oatley following a donation from Henry Herbert Wills. Manor Hall houses the largest and most dated rooms, some dating back to the early 20th century. One of its annexes, Manor House, has recently been refurbished and officially 'reopened' in 1999. \nOn the central precinct sits The Hawthorns, a student house accommodating 115 undergraduate students. The house started life as a collection of villas built somewhere between 1888 and 1924 that were later converted, bit by bit, into a hotel by John Dingle. The Hawthorns also houses conferencing facilities, the staff refectory and bar, the Accommodation Office and the Student Houses Office. 33 Colston Street was opened in the city centre in October 2011 after the university acquired the property in 2009.\nSeveral of the residences in the central precinct are more recent and have been built and are managed by third-party organisations under exclusivity arrangements with the university. New Bridewell House, opened in 2016, is in the former police HQ, and is operated by Fresh Student Housing. Unite House and Chantry Court, were opened in 2000 and 2003 respectively by the UNITE Group. Dean's Court (2001, postgraduates only) and Woodland Court (2005), are both run by the Dominion Housing Group.\nAll of the main halls elect groups of students to the Junior Common Room to organise the halls social calendar for the next year. Residents of student houses, private accommodation and students living at home become members of Orbital\u00a0\u2013 a society organising social events for students throughout the year.\nSport.\nSports membership at Bristol University totals up to 4,000 students across a wide range of unique team and individual pursuits. Its network of over 70 sports clubs and four sites are run by the university's Student Union and its Sport, Exercise and Health Department. Competing with other universities in the British Universities and Colleges Sport league (BUCS), Bristol university is placed 8th in the country.\nThe university caters to its students with sporting facilities split across four primary complexes:\nBristol University Indoor Sports Centre- The Indoor Sports Centre is located at the heart of the university campus and is home to a fully equipped two-storey gym, fitness studios, sports hall and Sports Medicine Clinic.\nCoombe Dingle Sports Complex- This 38-acre site in the heart of Stoke Bishop, features the only indoor tennis centre in Bristol and is where the university's more traditional outdoor sports reside. Coombe Dingle is typically used for training and competition. Throughout the year Coombe Dingle hosts a variety of competitive fixtures, including inter-university BUCS matches, plus local and national league matches.:\nFacilities available at Coombe Dingle Sports Complex:\n\u2022 3G pitch\n\u2022 Artificial pitches (sand dressed and floodlit)\n\u2022 Grass pitches (football and rugby)\n\u2022 Cricket squares and nets (including grass)\n\u2022 Tennis courts, indoor and outdoor (floodlit)\n\u2022 Lacrosse pitch\n\u2022 Netball courts (outdoor)\n\u2022 Olympic weight lifting gym\n\u2022 Softball and rounders facilities\n\u2022 Pavilion, lounge bar and meeting rooms\n\u2022 Sports Medicine Clinic\nRichmond Building- The university swimming pool is located inside the student union (Richmond Building). This six-lane swimming pool has a moveable bulkhead, creating a competition-length main pool, alongside a comfortable teaching pool for lessons. The pool is available to students, staff and the community for lane and casual swimming, or lessons, on a membership or pay-as-you-go basis.\nSaltford Boathouse- The University Boathouse is based at Saltford, halfway to Bath on the River Avon. \nUsed for term-time training/competition and out-of-term recreational water sport, the Boathouse moors up the universities rowing and sailing boats.\nNotable people.\nAcademics.\nCurrent academics at the University of Bristol include 23 fellows of the Academy of Medical Sciences, 13 fellows of the British Academy, 13 fellows of the Royal Academy of Engineering, 43 fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences and 48 fellows of the Royal Society. These include, Sir Michael Berry, one of the discoverers of quantum mechanics' \"geometric phase\", John Rarity international expert on quantum optics, quantum cryptography and quantum communication, David May, computer scientist and lead architect for the transputer, Mark Horton, a British maritime and historical archaeologist and Bruce Hood, a world-leading experimental psychologist.\nAcademics in computer science include, David Cliff, inventor and computer scientist, Peter Flach, Mike Fraser, professor of human-computer interaction, Julian Gough and Nigel Smart.

Sir Michael Berry shared the award (with Andre Geim, a Nobel Laureate) for using magnets to levitate a frog. Gareth Jones also shared an Ig Nobel prize for scientifically documenting fellatio in fruit bats. Dr. Len Fisher was awarded the 1999 prize for physics for calculating the optimal way to dunk a biscuit.\nAlumni.\nBristol alumnus Paul Dirac went on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933 for his contribution to the formulation of quantum mechanics and is considered one of the most significant physicists of the 20th century. Other notable scientists include Dani Rabaiotti, an environmental scientist and science communicator, and Eliahu Nissim, a professor of aeronautical engineering, and the president of the Open University of Israel.\nWriters to have studied at Bristol include Dick King-Smith; Sarah Kane; Angela Carter; Dorothy Simpson; David Gibbins; Julia Donaldson; Olivier award-winning playwright Laura Wade; Maddie Mortimer; Holly Smale; and David Nicholls, author of the novel \"Starter for Ten\", turned into a screenplay set in the University of Bristol.\nIn government and politics, notable alumni include Albert II, Prince of Monaco; George Odlum, former Deputy Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, and first Afro-Caribbean president of the Bristol University Students' Union; Prime Minister Hun Manet of Cambodia; former Liberal Democrat MP Lembit \u00d6pik, who was president of Bristol University Students' Union; Sir Jonathan Evans, former head of MI5; Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Chairperson of the African Union Commission from October 2012 to January 2017; Karen Ramagge Prescott, the first female Speaker of the Gibraltar Parliament and Paul Boateng, the UK's first Black Cabinet Minister.\nIn current affairs, former students include journalist and \"McMafia\" author Misha Glenny; BBC News Chief Political Correspondent James Landale (who founded the university independent newspaper \"Epigram\"); author and journalist Julie Myerson; editor-in-chief of the Telegraph Media Group William Lewis; editor-in-chief of The Observer Will Hutton; Radio 4 presenter Sue Lawley; newsreader Alastair Stewart; and Sky News US Correspondent Dominic Waghorn. \"BBC Breakfast\" and \"Good Morning Britain\" anchor Susanna Reid was an editor of \"Epigram\".\nIn entertainment, former students include rapper Shygirl; singer James Blunt; illusionist Derren Brown; comedians Jon Richardson, Marcus Brigstocke (who did not graduate), Matt Lucas and David Walliams; actors Simon Pegg, Jason Isaacs, and Pearl Mackie; anime YouTuber Gigguk; \"Brass Eye\" creator Chris Morris; West End Composer and Lyricist Pippa Cleary and \"Stath Lets Flats\" creator Jamie Demetriou.\nNotable alumni from the Film and Television Production department include film directors Mick Jackson; Michael Winterbottom; Marc Evans; Christopher Smith; Alex Cox; Peter Webber; and Maddie Moate.\nOther alumni include Anne McClain, member of the 2013 NASA Astronaut Class; mathematician Iain Gordon; long jumper Jazmin Sawyers; Luke Bond, an organist at Windsor Castle; and baker Kim-Joy Hewlett.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He fought mainly as a light heavyweight and heavyweight in a career lasting from 1908 to 1926. A French professional champion on several occasions, he became the European heavyweight champion before the First World War. A sergeant aviator during the Great War, he was wounded before returning to civilian life. He then discovered rugby union, playing as a winger.\nOn his return to the ring in 1919, \"le grand Georges\" (\"the great Georges\" in English) he was celebrated as a symbol of a sporting powerhouse France, via performances in Great Britain and the United States of America. His knockout victory over Battling Levinsky on 12 October 1920 in Jersey City in the United States earned him the title of world champion. A defeat by Jack Dempsey the following year nevertheless strengthened his legend and brought him worldwide fame. This defeat marked the decline of his career, punctuated by the controversial loss of his titles to Battling Siki.\nNicknamed the \"Orchid Man\", he stood and his fighting weight ranged from .\nLater notable performances included a defeat by Gene Tunney. Carpentier ended his career in 1926, but remained a leading figure in French boxing. Appointed ambassador for French sport abroad after the Second World War, in which he took part in the French Air Force, Carpentier died of a heart attack in 1975. A decade after his death, the Parisian Sports Arena in the 13th arrondissement of Paris was renamed Halle Georges-Carpentier after him. Along with Marcel Cerdan, he remains one of France's best boxers.\nBiography.\nBorn in Li\u00e9vin in Pas-de-Calais, Carpentier began his career by progressing up through the weight divisions, fighting in every division from welterweight upwards. After making his first professional bout at age 14, he was welterweight champion of France and of Europe in 1911, middleweight champion of Europe in 1912, and light heavyweight champion of Europe in 1913. On 1 June 1913, he beat \"Bombardier\" Billy Wells in Ghent, Belgium to become heavyweight champion of Europe. He defended his title in December against Wells, in January 1914 against Pat O'Keeffe and in London on 16 July he beat Ed \"Gunboat\" Smith to add the \"White Heavyweight Champion of the World\" to his European title. The white heavyweight title bout sported a purse worth \u00a39,000 (equivalent to approximately \u00a3 today).\nCarpentier was also a referee during the early stages of his career, supervising a number of fights including the world title bout between Jack Johnson and Frank Moran in June 1914. Carpentier was a French Air Force aviator during World War I and was awarded two of the highest French military honors, the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille Militaire. This served to heighten his already exceptional popularity, not only in France but also in the United Kingdom and the United States.\nCarpentier defended his title twice again in 1919 before dropping down a weight class to challenge Battling Levinsky for the light heavyweight championship of the world. The fight took place on 12 October 1920, in Jersey City and Levinsky was knocked out in the fourth. Carpentier's attempt at the heavyweight Championship of the world came on 2 July 1921, again in Jersey City, when he faced Jack Dempsey in front of boxing's first million dollar gate (approximately $ today). Carpentier was badly beaten around before suffering a knockout in the second minute of the fourth round and never fought again for that title. He lost his world light heavyweight title and his European heavyweight and light heavyweight titles the following year, on 24 September 1922, in a controversial bout with Senegalese fighter Battling Siki. His last truly noteworthy fight was on 24 July 1924, with Gene Tunney at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan, New York City. Carpentier lost the bout by TKO after fifteen rounds. He retired from the ring after a final exhibition bout in 1927.\nFollowing his retirement from boxing, Carpentier spent a number of years as a vaudeville song-and-dance man, mostly in the UK and the US. As a singer he cut http:// for Path\u00e9, in the style of French singer Maurice Chevalier. He is the author of a boxing novel, \"Brothers of the Brown Owl: A Story of the Boxing Ring\" published c. 1920 by Cassell and Company (being a volume in the uniform Cassell's Empire Library). He also appeared in half a dozen motion pictures, starring in both silent films and talkies. He made three films in Hollywood, US, one for director J. Stuart Blackton in England and two in his native France. His last screen appearance was in 1934. Soon after, he became proprietor of an upmarket bar, \"Chez Georges Carpentier\", in a chic Paris neighbourhood. In several different locations, this is the profession he would exercise until shortly before his death.\nFrom the time they boxed together in 1921, Carpentier remained close friends with Jack Dempsey. They visited each other in New York and Paris, got together to commemorate the anniversary of their famous bout and exchanged birthday greetings.\nDeath.\nCarpentier died in Paris at age 81 in 1975 of a heart attack, and was buried in the cimeti\u00e8re de Vaires-sur-Marne, Seine-et-Marne, France.\nLegacy.\nHe was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.\nProfessional boxing record.\n! style=\"text-align:left;\"|Newspaper decisions/draws\nAll newspaper decisions are officially regarded as \u201cno decision\u201d bouts and are not counted in the win/loss/draw column.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded on 1 June 1922 as a successor to the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) following the partition of Ireland. At its peak the force had around 8,500 officers, with a further 4,500 who were members of the RUC Reserve. \nThe RUC policed Northern Ireland from the aftermath of the Irish War of Independence until after the turn of the 21st century and played a major role in the Troubles between the 1960s and the 1990s. Due to the threat from the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), who saw the RUC as enforcing British rule, the force was heavily armed and militarised. Officers routinely carried submachine guns and assault rifles, travelled in armoured vehicles, and were based in heavily fortified police stations. It was the first police force to use rubber and plastic bullets for riot control. \nThe RUC's membership was overwhelmingly Protestant, leading to accusations by sections of the Catholic and Irish nationalist minority of one-sided policing and sectarianism. Officers were also accused of police brutality as well as collusion with loyalist paramilitaries. Conversely, it was praised as one of the most professional police forces in the world by British security forces. During the Troubles, 319 RUC officers were killed and almost 9,000 injured in paramilitary assassinations or attacks, mostly by the IRA, which made the RUC the most dangerous police force in the world in which to serve by 1983. In the same period, the RUC killed 55 people, 28 of whom were civilians. In 2000, the RUC was awarded the George Cross for bravery.\nThe RUC was superseded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in 2001, as mandated by the final version of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000. Allegations regarding collusion prompted several inquiries, the most recent of which was authored by Police Ombudsman Nuala O'Loan in 2007. The report identified police, CID and Special Branch collusion with loyalist terrorists, but no member of the RUC has been charged or convicted of any criminal acts as a result of these inquiries. O'Loan stated in her conclusions that there was no reason to believe the findings of the investigation were isolated incidents.\nHistory.\nEstablishment.\nUnder section 60 of the Government of Ireland Act 1920, Northern Ireland was placed under the jurisdiction of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC). On 31 January 1921, Richard Dawson Bates, the first Minister of Home Affairs for Northern Ireland, appointed a committee of inquiry on police organisation in the region. It was asked to advise on any alterations to the existing police necessary for the formation of a new force (i.e. recruitment and conditions of service, composition, strength and cost).\nAn interim report was published on 28 March 1922, the first official report of the new Parliament of Northern Ireland, and was subsequently accepted by the Northern Ireland Government. On 29 April 1922, King George V granted to the force the name Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In May, the Parliament of Northern Ireland passed the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Constabulary Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 (12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5. c. 8 (N.I.)), and the RUC officially came into existence on 1 June. The headquarters of the force was established at Atlantic Buildings, Waring Street, Belfast. The uniform remained essentially the same as that of the RIC \u2013 a dark green, as opposed to the dark blue worn by the other British police forces and the . A new badge of the Red Hand of Ulster on a St George's Cross surrounded by a chain was designed but proved unpopular and was never uniformly adopted. Eventually the harp and crown insignia of the Order of St Patrick, as worn by the RIC, was adopted.\nFrom the beginning the RUC had a dual role, unique among British police forces, of providing a normal law enforcement service while enforcing the new Northern Ireland entity in the face of considerable opposition, both armed and unarmed. To this end, its members were armed, as the RIC had been. The RUC was limited by statute to a 3,000-strong force. Initially, a third of positions within the force were reserved for Catholics, a reflection of the denominational proportions of the population of Northern Ireland at that time. The first two thousand places were filled quickly and those reserved for Catholics were filled mainly by ex-RIC members fleeing north. Due to reluctance by the political establishment to employ too many Catholics (who were seen as potentially disloyal to the Protestant and unionist ethos of the new government) the force abandoned this policy. As a result, representation of Catholics in the RUC never exceeded 20%. In addition, many Catholics who joined the force, particularly during the Troubles, were targeted for murder or ostracised by their own community. By the 1960s, representation of Catholics in the RUC had fallen to 12%.\nThe RUC were supported by the Ulster Special Constabulary, a volunteer body of part-time auxiliary police established before the Northern Ireland government was set up, who had already been given uniforms and training. The RUC's senior officer, the Inspector General, was appointed by the Governor of Northern Ireland and was responsible to the Minister of Home Affairs in the Northern Ireland government for the maintenance of law and order.\nEarly years.\nThe polarised political climate in Northern Ireland resulted in violence from both sides of the political and sectarian divide. The lawlessness that affected the region during the early 1920s, and the problems it caused for the RUC, are indicated in a police report drawn up by District Inspector R.R. Spears in February 1923. Referring to the situation in Belfast after July 1921 he stated:For twelve months after that, the city was in a state of turmoil. The IRA (Irish Republican Army) was responsible for an enormous number of murders, bombings, shootings and incendiary fires. The work of the police against them was, however, greatly hampered by the fact that the rough element on the Protestant side entered thoroughly into the disturbances, met murder with murder and adopted in many respects the tactics of the rebel gunmen. In the endeavour to cope simultaneously with the warring factions the police efforts were practically nullified. They were quite unable to rely on the restraint of one party while they dealt with the other.\nAbout ninety police officers were killed between 1920 and 1922 in what would become Northern Ireland (see The Troubles in Northern Ireland (1920\u20131922)). The security forces were implicated in reprisal killings of Catholics but no convictions ever rendered. Most notable of these incidents were the McMahon killings on 26 March 1922, in which six Catholics were killed; and the Arnon Street killings several days later on 1 April 1922, in which six more Catholics were shot dead in retaliation for the IRA killing of a policeman. By the mid-1920s the situation had calmed down; for the next forty-five years the murder rate in Northern Ireland would be lower than in the rest of the UK and the crime detection rate higher.\nThe 1920s and 1930s were years of economic austerity. Many of Northern Ireland's traditional industries, notably linen and shipbuilding, were in recession, which contributed to the already high level of unemployment. Serious rioting broke out in 1932 in Belfast in protest at inadequate relief for the unemployed. In response to the growth of motorised transport, the RUC Traffic Branch was formed on 1 January 1930. In 1936 the police depot at Enniskillen was formally opened and an \u00a3800,000 scheme to create a network of 196 police barracks throughout Northern Ireland by rationalizing or repairing the 224 premises inherited from the RIC was underway. In May 1937 a new white glass lamp with the RUC crest went up for the first time to replace the RIC crest still on many stations. About the same time the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in Belfast was significantly expanded, with a detective head constable being appointed to head the CID force in each of the five Belfast police districts. There was sporadic IRA activity in the 1930s.\nIn 1937, on the occasion of the visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth to the province, the IRA blew up a number of customs posts. In 1939 the IRA launched its Sabotage Campaign in England, which would end a few days before the outbreak of the Second World War. The war brought additional responsibilities for the police: the security of the land border with the Republic of Ireland, which remained neutral during the war, was one important consideration; smuggling greatly increased due to rationing, to the point where police virtually became revenue officers; and many wartime regulations had to be enforced, including \"black-out\" requirements on house and vehicle lights, the arrest of striking workers, port security, and restrictions on the movement of vehicles and use of petrol.\nThe RUC was a \"reserved occupation\", i.e. the police force was deemed essential to the domestic war effort and its members were forbidden to leave to join the other services. The wartime situation gave a new urgency to discussions regarding the appointment of women police. The Ministry of Home Affairs finally gave approval to the enrolment of women as members of the RUC on 16 April 1943, with the first six recruits starting on 15 November, headed by Marion Paterson Macmillan, who transferred from the Metropolitan Police. Post-war policies brought about a gradual improvement in the lot of the RUC, interrupted only by a return to hostilities by the IRA border campaign from 1957 to 1962, in which seven RUC officers were killed. The force was streamlined in the 1960s, a new headquarters was opened at Knock, Belfast and a number of rural barracks were closed.\n\"The Troubles\".\nThe civil rights protests during the 1960s, and the reaction to them, marked the beginning of the conflict that became known as \"the Troubles\". The RUC found itself confronting marchers protesting against gerrymandering of local electoral wards and discrimination in local housing allocation. Many of these Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association protests were banned or truncated by the government of Northern Ireland. The Ulster Special Constabulary were controversial, with the unit seen by some nationalists as more anti-Catholic and anti-nationalist than the RUC, which, unlike the B Specials, did attract some Catholic recruits. The severe pressure on the RUC and the perceived partiality of the B-Specials led, during the Northern Ireland riots of August 1969, to the British Army being called in to support the civil administration under Operation Banner. Catholics largely turned away from the British Army, who they saw as treating Protestants differently, especially after the Falls Curfew.\nReform.\nThe high level of civil unrest led to an exhaustive inquiry into the disturbances in Northern Ireland carried out by Lord Scarman, which produced a report in 1972. James Callaghan, Home Secretary in 1969, called on Brigadier John Hunt (Lord Hunt) to assess, advise and report on the policing situation. He was assisted in this task by Sir Robert Mark, who later became Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service, and Sir James Robertson, then-Chief Constable of Glasgow. The Hunt Report was published on 3 October 1969, and most of its recommendations were subsequently accepted and implemented. The aim was to completely reorganise the RUC, both modernizing the force and bringing it into line with the other police forces in the UK. This meant the introduction of the British rank and promotion structure, the creation of 12 police divisions and 39 sub-divisions, the disbandment of the Ulster Special Constabulary, and the creation of a police authority designed to be representative of all segments of the community.\nCallaghan, later elected Prime Minister, asked Sir Arthur Young, Commissioner of the City of London Police, to be seconded for a year. Young's appointment began the long process of turning the RUC into a British police service. The RUC Reserve was formed as an auxiliary police force, and all military-style duties were handed over to the newly formed Ulster Defence Regiment, which was under military command and replaced the B Specials. Callaghan selected Young, a career policeman, because no other British policeman could match his direct experience of policing acutely unstable societies and of reforming gendarmeries. from 1943 to 1945, he was Director of Public Safety and Director of Security in the military government of Allied-occupied Italy. Later, he had been seconded to the Federation of Malaya at the height of the Malayan Emergency (1952\u201353) and to the crown colony of Kenya during the Mau Mau rebellion (1954).\nFirst deaths.\nThe first deaths of the Troubles occurred in July 1969. Francis McCloskey, a 67-year-old Catholic civilian, had been found unconscious on 13 July near the Dungiven Orange Hall following a police baton charge against a crowd who had been throwing stones at the hall. Witnesses later said they had seen police batoning a figure in the doorway where McCloskey was found, although police claimed that he had been unconscious before the baton charge and may have been hit with a stone. He was taken to hospital and died the following day.\nOn 11 October 1969, Constable Victor Arbuckle was shot dead by loyalists on Belfast's Shankill Road during serious rioting in protest at the recommendations of the Hunt Report. Arbuckle was the first police fatality of the Troubles. In August 1970, two young constables, Donaldson and Millar, died when an abandoned car they were examining near the strongly republican town of Crossmaglen exploded. They became the first security forces victims of the Provisional Irish Republican Army campaign. This campaign involved the targeting of police officers, and continued until the final ceasefire in 1997, as the peace process gained momentum. The last RUC officer killed, Constable Francis O'Reilly (a Catholic), was also killed by loyalists, in a September 1998 bombing during the Drumcree conflict.\nLater years.\nIn March 1972, the Government of Northern Ireland resigned and the parliament was prorogued. Northern Ireland subsequently came under direct rule from Westminster with its own Secretary of State, who had overall responsibility for security policy. From the mid-1970s onward, the British policy of Ulsterisation meant RUC officers taking a more prominent role in the conflict than previously, which increased their casualty rate. Starting in late 1982, a number of IRA and Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) men were shot dead by the RUC. This led to accusations of a shoot-to-kill policy by the RUC. In September 1983, four officers were charged with murder in connection with the deaths. Although all were subsequently found not guilty, the British government set up the Stalker Inquiry to investigate further. In May 1986, Sir John Hermon, then Chief Constable, publicly accused unionist politicians of \"consorting with paramilitary elements\".\nAnger over the Anglo-Irish Agreement led to loyalist assaults on more than 500 homes belonging to Catholics and RUC officers during the mid-1980s. At least 150 RUC families were forced to move as a result. In 1998 Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan stated in an interview on television that he was unhappy with any RUC officers belonging to the Orange Order or any of the other loyal orders. While the RUC refused to give any details on how many officers were members of the Order, thirty-nine RUC officers are listed on the Order's Roll of Honour (of 'Orangemen' killed in the conflict). The size of the RUC was increased on several occasions. At its height, there were 8,500 regular police officers supported by about 5,000 full-time and part-time reserve officers, making it the second largest force in the United Kingdom after the Metropolitan Police in London. The direction and control of the RUC was in the hands in the Chief Constable, who was assisted by two Deputy Chief Constables and nine Assistant Chief Constables. For operational purposes, Northern Ireland was divided into twelve Divisions and thirty-nine Sub-Divisions. RUC ranks, duties, conditions of service and pay were generally in line with those of police forces in Great Britain. \nPolicing in a divided society.\nPolicing Northern Ireland's divided society proved to be difficult, as each of the main religious blocs (Protestant and Roman Catholic) had different attitudes towards the institutions of the state. To most Ulster Protestants, the state had full legitimacy, as did its institutions, its parliament, its police force and the Crown. Many of Northern Ireland's Catholics, along with their political leaders, believed that partition would be only temporary. Many abstained from and/or refused to take part in Northern Ireland's institutions for a variety of reasons, including the treatment of Catholic civilians by the Ulster Special Constabulary during the recent conflict and the mistaken belief that Northern Ireland would be ceded to the Free State in the not too distant future. Protestant fears of strategically important government services being infiltrated by Catholics disloyal to the new state polarised society and made most Catholics unwilling and/or unable to join either the police or the civil service.\nThis mindset was referenced by David Trimble:Ulster Unionists, fearful of being isolated on the island, built a solid house, but it was a cold house for Catholics. And northern nationalists, although they had a roof over their heads, seemed to us as if they meant to burn the house down\nIn August 1922, Dawson Bates gave the Orange Order special permission for an Orange Lodge to be formed in the RUC. In April 1923 he spoke at its first reunion. In 1924 John William Nixon, a District Inspector suspected of involvement in the murder of Catholic civilians, would be dismissed after widespread complaints that he had made a \"fiercely Unionist\" speech at an Orange Order function. An inquiry by the British National Council for Civil Liberties in 1936 concluded that:[I]t is difficult to escape the conclusion that the attitude of the government renders the police chary of interference with the activities of the Orange Order and its sympathisers.\nOn 4 April 1922, the RIC was disbanded. Three days later, the Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922 came into force, and the Belfast government, although prohibited from raising or controlling a military force, appointed Major General Frederick Solly-Flood as a military advisor. The RUC was to be 3,000-strong, recruiting 2,000 ex-RIC and 1,000 \"A Specials\". It was intended that half of the RIC men recruited were to be Catholic, making up a third of positions within the force. However, fewer than half the expected number of Catholics came forward and the balance was made up with more A Specials, who continued to exist as a separate force.\nThroughout its existence, republican political leaders and most Roman Catholic clerics discouraged Catholics from joining the RUC. Seamus Mallon, Social Democratic and Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP) and critic of the force, who later served as Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland, stated that the RUC was \"97% Protestant and 100% unionist\". The RUC did attract some Roman Catholics, mostly former members of the RIC, who came north from the Irish Free State after the bitterness of the fighting during the Anglo-Irish War largely precluded them from remaining in territory now controlled by their enemies. The percentage of Catholics in the RUC dropped as these men retired over time. \nNotable Catholics in the RUC include RUC Chief Constable Sir James Flanagan, who survived an IRA assassination attempt; Deputy Chief Constable Michael McAtamney; Assistant Chief Constable Cathal Ramsey; Chief Superintendent Frank Lagan, and Superintendents Kevin Benedict Sheehy and Brendan McGuigan. In December 1997, \"The Independent\" (London) published a leaked internal RUC document which reported that a third of all Catholic RUC officers had reported suffering religious discrimination and/or harassment from Protestant fellow officers.\nCasualties.\nAccording to \"The Thin Green Line \u2013 The History of the Royal Ulster Constabulary GC\", written by RUC reservist Richard Doherty, 314 officers were killed and over 9,000 were injured during the existence of the RUC. All but 12 of the dead were killed during the Troubles (1969 to 1998), of whom 277 were killed in attacks by Irish republicans. According to the CAIN project at the University of Ulster, however, 301 RUC officers and 18 former or retired RUC officers were killed, totaling 319 fatalities.\nThe Newry mortar attack by the Provisional IRA on an RUC station in 1985, which killed nine officers (including two Catholics), resulted in the highest number of deaths inflicted on the RUC in one incident. The two highest-ranking RUC officers to be killed during \"the Troubles\" were Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent Robert Buchanan, who were ambushed by the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade outside Jonesborough, County Armagh, on 20 March 1989. On 4 December 2013, in a report by judge Peter Smithwick in the Smithwick Tribunal (a public inquiry), it was alleged that members of the Republic's police force (Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na) had colluded in the killing of the two policemen. The last RUC officer killed as a direct result of the conflict, Francis O'Reilly (a Catholic constable), died on 6 October 1998, a month after he had been injured in a Red Hand Defenders pipe-bomb attack in Portadown during the Drumcree conflict.\nCriticism.\nIll-treatment of children.\nOn 1 July 1992, Human Rights Watch (HRW) issued a detailed report, alleging RUC and paramilitary violations against children's rights during the Troubles. Both Catholic and Protestant children alleged regular and severe physical assault and mental harassment at the hands of RUC officers, usually conducted to force a false confession of a crime. In an accompanying statement, HRW cited allegations that:Police officers and soldiers harass young people on the street hitting, kicking and insulting them. Police officers in interrogation centres insult, trick and threaten youngsters and sometimes physically assault them. Children are locked up in adult detention centres and prisons in shameful conditions. Helsinki Watch heard dozens of stories from children, their parents, lawyers, youth workers and political leaders of children being stopped on the street and hit, kicked and abused again and again by police and soldiers. And seventeen-year-olds told Human Rights Watch Helsinki of severe beatings in detention during interrogations by police.\nPatten report.\nThe Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998 produced a wholesale reorganisation of inter-community, governmental and policing systems, including a power-sharing executive. The bias, and the under-representation of Catholics and nationalists in the RUC led to, as part of the Good Friday Agreement, a fundamental policing review, headed by Chris Patten, a former British Governor of Hong Kong and Conservative Minister under Margaret Thatcher. The review was published in September 1999. It recommended a wholesale reorganisation of policing, with the Royal Ulster Constabulary being replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), and a drive to recruit Catholics and the adoption of a new crest and cap badge. The PSNI was introduced in November 2001. As part of the change, the police service dropped the word \"Royal\" from and adopted a new badge that included the crown, harp, and shamrock, an attempt at representation of the major ideologies. \nLoyalist collusion.\nSpecial Patrol Group.\nThe Special Patrol Group was formed in the late 1960s as the Police Reserve Force. The name was changed to avoid confusion with the newly formed part-time Police Reserve in 1970, and was renamed \"Divisional Mobile Support Unit\" in 1980 after two of its members were convicted of kidnap and murder. The two, John Weir and Billy McCaughey, implicated some of their colleagues in a range of crimes including giving weapons, information and transport to loyalist paramilitaries as well as carrying out shooting and bombing attacks of their own. Weir alleged that senior officers, including Chief Superintendent Harry Breen, were aware of and approved of their activity.\nThe Stevens Inquiries.\nOn 18 April 2003 as part of the third report into collusion between Ulster loyalist paramilitaries, RUC, and British Army, Sir John Stevens published an Overview and Recommendations document (Stevens 3). Stevens' intention was to make recommendations which arose from serious shortcomings he had identified in all three Inquiries. In his autobiography, Stevens was at pains to point out the high regard in which he held many RUC officers, including Detective Superintendent Maurice Neilly, who was killed in the 1994 Chinook air crash.\nThe third Stevens Inquiry began in 1999, and referred to his previous reports when making his recommendations. Stevens' third inquiry focused in detail on only two of the killings in which collusion was alleged; that of Brian Adam Lambert in 1987 and of Pat Finucane in 1989. Stevens used the following criteria as a definition of collusion while conducting his investigation:\nOn 12 December 2012 the British Prime minister David Cameron admitted a statement to the House of Commons that \"shocking levels of collusion occurred in the murder of Finucane.\"\nPolice Ombudsman.\nIn a report released on 22 January 2007, the Police Ombudsman Dame Nuala O'Loan stated Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) informers committed serious crimes, including murder, with the full knowledge of their handlers. The report stated that RUC Special Branch officers created false statements, blocked evidence searches and \"baby-sat\" suspects during interviews.\nAwards.\nAwards for gallantry for individual officers since 1969 included 16 George Medals, 103 Queen's Gallantry Medals, 111 Queen's Commendations for Bravery and 69 Queen's Police Medals.\nOn 12 April 2000, the RUC was awarded the George Cross for bravery, a rare honour which had been awarded collectively only once before, to the island nation of Malta. The Award stated:For the past 30 years, the Royal Ulster Constabulary has been the bulwark against, and the main target of, a sustained and brutal terrorism campaign. The Force has suffered heavily in protecting both sides of the community from danger \u2013 302 officers have been killed in the line of duty and thousands more injured, many seriously. Many officers have been ostracised by their own community and others have been forced to leave their homes in the face of threats to them and their families. As Northern Ireland reaches a turning point in its political development this award is made to recognise the collective courage and dedication to duty of all of those who have served in the Royal Ulster Constabulary and who have accepted the danger and stress this has brought to them and to their families.\nChief officers.\nThe chief officer of the Royal Irish Constabulary was its Inspector-General (the last of whom, Sir Thomas J. Smith served from 11 March 1920 until partition in 1922). Between 1922 and 1969 the position of Inspector-General of the RUC was held by five officers, the last being Sir Arthur Young, who was seconded for a year from the City of London Police to implement the Hunt Report. Under Young, the title was changed to Chief Constable in line with the recommendations of the Hunt Report. Young and six others held the job until the RUC was incorporated to the PSNI. The final incumbent, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, became the first Chief Constable of the PSNI.\nGeorge Cross Foundation.\nThe Royal Ulster Constabulary GC Foundation was established by virtue of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 for the purpose of \"marking the sacrifice and honouring the achievements of the Royal Ulster Constabulary\".\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This ability to create light was then co-opted as a mating signal and, in a further development, adult female fireflies of the genus \"Photuris\" mimic the flash pattern of the \"Photinus\" beetle to trap their males as prey.\nFireflies are found in temperate and tropical climates. Many live in marshes or in wet, wooded areas where their larvae have abundant sources of food. Although all fireflies nominally glow as larvae, only some species produce light in their adult stage, and the location of the light organ varies among species and between sexes of the same species. Fireflies have attracted human attention since classical antiquity; their presence has been taken to signify a wide variety of conditions in different cultures and is especially appreciated aesthetically in Japan, where parks are set aside for this specific purpose.\nBiology.\nFireflies are beetles and in many aspects resemble other beetles at all stages of their life cycle, undergoing complete metamorphosis. A few days after mating, a female lays her fertilized eggs on or just below the surface of the ground. The eggs hatch three to four weeks later. In certain firefly species with aquatic larvae, such as \"Aquatica leii\", the female oviposits on emergent portions of aquatic plants, and the larvae descend into the water after hatching.\nThe larvae feed until the end of the summer. Most fireflies hibernate as larvae. Some do this by burrowing underground, while others find places on or under the bark of trees. They emerge in the spring. At least one species, \"Ellychnia corrusca\", overwinters as an adult. The larvae of most species are specialized predators and feed on other larvae, terrestrial snails, and slugs. Some are so specialized that they have grooved mandibles that deliver digestive fluids directly to their prey. The larval stage lasts from several weeks up to, in certain species, two or more years. The larvae pupate for one to two and a half weeks and emerge as adults.\nAdult diet varies among firefly species: some are predatory, while others feed on plant pollen or nectar. Some adults, like the European glow-worm, have no mouth, emerging only to mate and lay eggs before dying. In most species, adults live for a few weeks in summer.\nFireflies vary widely in their general appearance, with differences in color, shape, size, and features such as antennae. Adults differ in size depending on the species, with the largest up to long. Many species have non-flying larviform females. These can often be distinguished from the larvae only because the adult females have compound eyes, unlike the simple eyes of larvae, though the females have much smaller (and often highly regressed) eyes than those of their males. The most commonly known fireflies are nocturnal, although numerous species are diurnal and usually not luminescent; however, some species that remain in shadowy areas may produce light.\nMost fireflies are distasteful to vertebrate predators, as they contain the steroid pyrones lucibufagins, similar to the cardiotonic bufadienolides found in some poisonous toads. All fireflies glow as larvae, where bioluminescence is an aposematic warning signal to predators.\nLight and chemical production.\nLight production in fireflies is due to the chemical process of bioluminescence. This occurs in specialized light-emitting organs (known as photophores), usually located on a female firefly's lower abdomen. These fireflies produce the enzyme firefly luciferase that acts on another compound produced by fireflies, firefly luciferin. In the presence of magnesium ions, ATP, and oxygen, this reaction produces light. Oxygen is supplied via an abdominal trachea or breathing tube. Gene coding for these substances has been inserted into many different organisms. Firefly luciferase is used in forensics, and the enzyme has medical uses \u2013 in particular, for detecting the presence of ATP or magnesium. Fireflies produce a \"cold light\", with no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies. The light may be yellow, green, or pale red, with wavelengths from 510 to 670 nanometers. Some species such as the dimly glowing \"blue ghost\" of the Eastern US may seem to emit blueish-white light from a distance and in low light conditions, but their glow is bright green when observed up close. Their perceived blue tint may be due to the Purkinje effect. During a study on the genome of \"Aquatica leii\", scientists discovered two key genes are responsible for the formation, activation, and positioning of this firefly's light organ: Alabd-B and AlUnc-4.\nAdults emit light primarily for mate selection. Early larval bioluminescence was adopted in the phylogeny of adult fireflies, and was repeatedly gained and lost before becoming fixed and retained as a mechanism of sexual communication in many species. Adult lampyrids have a variety of ways to communicate with mates in courtships: steady glows, flashing, and the use of chemical signals unrelated to photic systems. Chemical signals, or pheromones, are the ancestral form of sexual communication; this pre-dates the evolution of flash signaling in the lineage, and is retained today in diurnally-active species. Some species, especially lightning bugs of the genera \"Photinus\", \"Photuris\", and \"Pyractomena\", are distinguished by the unique courtship flash patterns emitted by flying males in search of females. In general, females of the genus \"Photinus\" do not fly, but do give a flash response to males of their own species. Signals, whether photic or chemical, allow fireflies to identify mates of their own species. Flash signaling characteristics include differences in duration, timing, color, number and rate of repetitions, height of flight, and direction of flight (e.g. climbing or diving) and vary interspecifically and geographically. When flash signals are not sufficiently distinguished between species in a population, sexual selection encourages divergence of signaling patterns.\nSynchronization of flashing occurs in several species; it is explained as phase synchronization and spontaneous order. Tropical fireflies routinely synchronise their flashes among large groups, particularly in Southeast Asia. At night along river banks in the Malaysian jungles, fireflies synchronize their light emissions precisely. Hypotheses for the causes of this behavior involve diet, social interaction, and altitude. In the Philippines, thousands of fireflies can be seen all year-round in the town of Donsol. In the United States, one of the most famous sightings of fireflies blinking in unison occurs annually near Elkmont, Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains during the first weeks of June. Congaree National Park in South Carolina is another host to this phenomenon.\nFemale \"femme fatale\" \"Photuris\" fireflies mimic the photic signaling patterns of the smaller \"Photinus\", attracting males to what appears to be a suitable mate, then eating them. This provides the females with a supply of the toxic defensive lucibufagin chemicals.\nMany fireflies do not produce light. Usually these species are diurnal, or day-flying, such as those in the genus \"Ellychnia\". A few diurnal fireflies that inhabit primarily shadowy places, such as beneath tall plants or trees, are luminescent. One such genus is \"Lucidota\".\nNon-bioluminescent fireflies use pheromones to signal mates. Some basal groups lack bioluminescence and use chemical signaling instead. \"Phosphaenus hemipterus\" has photic organs, yet is a diurnal firefly and displays large antennae and small eyes. These traits suggest that pheromones are used for sexual selection, while photic organs are used for warning signals. In controlled experiments, males coming from downwind arrived at females first, indicating that males travel upwind along a pheromone plume. Males can find females without the use of visual cues, so sexual communication in \"P. hemipterus\" appears to be mediated entirely by pheromones.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe oldest known fossils of the Lampyridae family are \"Protoluciola\" and \"Flammarionella\" from the Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian ~ 99 million years ago) Burmese amber of Myanmar, which belong to the subfamily Luciolinae. The light producing organs are clearly present. The ancestral glow colour for the last common ancestor of all living fireflies has been inferred to be green, based on genomic analysis.\nTaxonomy.\nThe fireflies (including the lightning bugs) are a family, Lampyridae, of some 2,000 species within the Coleoptera. The family forms a single clade, a natural phylogenetic group. The term glowworm is used for both adults and larvae of firefly species such as \"Lampyris noctiluca\", the common European glowworm, in which only the nonflying adult females glow brightly; the flying males glow weakly and intermittently. In the Americas, \"glow worms\" are the closely related Coleopteran family Phengodidae, while in New Zealand and Australia, a \"glow worm\" is a luminescent larva of the fungus gnat \"Arachnocampa\", within the true flies, Diptera.\nPhylogeny.\nThe phylogeny of the Lampyridae family, based on both phylogenetic and morphological evidence by Martin et al. 2019, is:\nInteraction with humans.\nConservation.\nFirefly populations are thought to be declining worldwide. While monitoring data for many regions are scarce, a growing number of anecdotal reports, coupled with several published studies from Europe and Asia, suggest that fireflies are endangered. Recent IUCN Red List assessments for North American fireflies have identified species with heightened extinction risk in the US, with 18 taxa categorized as threatened with extinction.\nFireflies face threats including habitat loss and degradation, light pollution, pesticide use, poor water quality, invasive species, over-collection, and climate change. Firefly tourism, a quickly growing sector of the travel and tourism industry, has also been identified as a potential threat to fireflies and their habitats when not managed appropriately. Like many other organisms, fireflies are directly affected by land-use change (e.g., loss of habitat area and connectivity), which is identified as the main driver of biodiversity changes in terrestrial ecosystems. Pesticides, including insecticides and herbicides, have also been indicated as a likely cause of firefly decline. These chemicals can not only harm fireflies directly but also potentially reduce prey populations and degrade habitat. Light pollution is an especially concerning threat to fireflies. Since the majority of firefly species use bioluminescent courtship signals, they are also sensitive to environmental levels of light and consequently to light pollution. A growing number of studies investigating the effects of artificial light at night on fireflies has shown that light pollution can disrupt fireflies' courtship signals and even interfere with larval dispersal. Researchers agree that protecting and enhancing firefly habitat is necessary to conserve their populations. Recommendations include reducing or limiting artificial light at night, restoring habitats where threatened species occur, and eliminating unnecessary pesticide use, among many others.\nIn culture.\nFireflies have featured in human culture around the world for centuries. In Japan, the emergence of fireflies (Japanese: ) signifies the anticipated changing of the seasons; firefly viewing is a special aesthetic pleasure of midsummer, celebrated in parks that exist for that one purpose. The Japanese sword Hotarumaru, made in the 14th century, is so named for a legend that its flaws were repaired by fireflies.\nIn Italy, the firefly (Italian: ) appears in Canto XXVI of Dante's \"Inferno\", written in the 14th century:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Quante 'l villan ch'al poggio si riposa,\nnel tempo che colui che 'l mondo schiara\nla faccia sua a noi tien meno ascosa,\ncome la mosca cede a la zanzara,\nvede lucciole gi\u00f9 per la vallea,\nforse col\u00e0 dov' e' vendemmia e ara:\ndi tante fiamme tutta risplendea\nl'ottava bolgia, ...&lt;/poem&gt;\u2014\u200a\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As many as the fireflies which the peasant sees in the [Tuscan] valley below, when he is resting on the hill\u2014in the season [midsummer] when the sun hides least from us, and at the time of day [dusk] when the fly gives place to the mosquito\u2014perhaps in the fields where he tills the ground and gathers in the grapes; with that many flames the eighth ditch [of Hell] was shining, ...\u2014\u200a\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was created by NeXT Computer, Inc. using their OpenStep system, whose use of Objective-C made the package very easy to write. It was characterized by its very light weight and high speed in comparison to similar systems such as CORBA.\nVersions of PDO were available for Solaris, HP-UX and all versions of the OPENSTEP system, although an agreement was also announced for a version to be made for Digital Unix, then still known as OSF/1, with delivery anticipated after versions for SunOS and Solaris had been released. Product licence pricing for these platforms varied from $2,500 for use on a \"small server\" up to $10,000 for use on a \"large server\". A version that worked with Microsoft OLE was also available called \"D'OLE\", allowing distributed code written using PDO on any platform to be presented on Microsoft systems as if they were local OLE objects.\nPDO, on the other hand, relied on a small number of features in the Objective-C runtime to handle both portability as well as distribution. The key feature was the language's support for a \"second chance\" method in all classes; if a method call on an object failed because the object didn't support it (normally not allowed in most languages due to strong typing), the runtime would then bundle the message into a compact format and pass it back into the object's codice_1 method.\nThe normal behavior for codice_1 was to return an error, including details taken from the message (the \"invocation\"). PDO instead supplied a number of new objects with codice_1 methods that passed the invocation object to another machine on the network, with various versions to support different networks and platforms. Calling methods on remote objects was almost invisible; after some network setup (a few lines typically) PDO objects were instantiated locally and called the same way as any other object on the system. The PDO object then forwarded the invocation to the remote computer for processing and unbundled the results when they were returned.\nIn comparison with CORBA, PDO programs were typically 1/10 or less in size; it was common for NeXT staffers to write into magazines showing how to re-implement a multi-page CORBA article in perhaps 15 lines of code. From a programming standpoint, there was nearly nothing as easy to use as PDO.\nHowever, PDO was also reliant entirely on Objective-C to function. This was a price most were unwilling to pay, as at the time C++ was more widely used and the effort to shift codebases to an entirely new language and paradigm was considered too onerous. PDO never saw much use, and NeXT's emphasis shifted to its new WebObjects framework in 1995.\nThe ability to instantiate any object known to the local process from any other process is a known security vulnerability, and Apple strongly discourages use of PDO for that reason.\nIn addition to the OS X platform, there is GNUstep, which has its own implementation of Distributed Objects.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is most renowned for creating the 1569 world map based on a new projection which represented sailing courses of constant bearing (rhumb lines) as straight lines\u2014an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts.\nMercator was a notable maker of globes and scientific instruments. In addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics, and geomagnetism. He was also an accomplished engraver and calligrapher. Unlike other great scholars of the age, he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over a thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but in the second half of his life, he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in reference to a book of maps. However, Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (\"Cosmologia\") on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of the Titan Atlas, \"King of Mauretania\", whom he considered to be the first great geographer.\nA large part of Mercator's income came from sales of terrestrial and celestial globes. For sixty years they were considered the finest in the world, and were sold in such numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving the manufacture of the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing them all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.\nMercator wrote on geography, philosophy, chronology and theology. All of the wall maps were engraved with copious text on the region concerned. As an example, the famous world map of 1569 is inscribed with over five thousand words in fifteen legends. The 1595 Atlas has about 120 pages of maps and illustrated title pages, but a greater number of pages are devoted to his account of the creation of the universe and descriptions of all the countries portrayed. His table of chronology ran to some 400 pages fixing the dates (from the time of creation) of earthly dynasties, major political and military events, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and eclipses. He also wrote on the gospels and the Old Testament.\nMercator was a devout Christian born into a Catholic family at a time when Martin Luther's Protestantism was gaining ground. He never declared himself as a Lutheran but was clearly sympathetic, and he was accused of heresy by Catholic authorities; after six months in prison he was released unscathed. This period of persecution is probably the major factor in his move from Catholic Leuven (Louvain) to a more tolerant Duisburg, in the Holy Roman Empire, where he lived for the last thirty years of his life. Walter Ghim, Mercator's friend and first biographer, describes him as sober in his behaviour, yet cheerful and witty in company, and never more happy than in debate with other scholars.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nGerardus Mercator was born Geert or Gerard (De) Kremer (or Cremer) in Rupelmonde, Flanders, a small village to the southwest of Antwerp, which was in the fiefdom of Habsburg Netherlands. The seventh child of Hubert (De) Kremer and his wife Emerance, his parents came from Gangelt in the Duchy of J\u00fclich (present-day Germany). At the time of the birth they were visiting Hubert's brother (or uncle) Gisbert De Kremer. Hubert was a poor artisan, a shoemaker by trade, but Gisbert, a priest, was a man of some importance in the community. Their stay in Rupelmonde was brief and within six months they returned to Gangelt, and there Mercator spent his earliest childhood until the age of six. In 1518, the Kremer family moved back to Rupelmonde, possibly motivated by the deteriorating conditions in Gangelt\u2014famine, plague and lawlessness. Mercator would have attended the local school in Rupelmonde from the age of seven, when he arrived from Gangelt, and there he would have been taught the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and Latin.\nSchool at 's-Hertogenbosch, 1526\u20131530.\nAfter Hubert's death in 1526, Gisbert became the 15-year-old Geert's guardian. Hoping that Geert might follow him into the priesthood, he sent him to the famous school of the Brethren of the Common Life at 's-Hertogenbosch in the Duchy of Brabant. The Brotherhood and the school was founded by the charismatic Geert Groote who placed great emphasis on study of the Bible and, at the same time, expressed disapproval of the dogmas of the church, both facets of the new \"heresies\" of Martin Luther propounded only a few years earlier in 1517. Mercator would follow similar precepts later in life, with problematic outcomes.\nDuring his time at the school the headmaster was Georgius Macropedius, and under his guidance Geert would study the Bible, the trivium (Latin, logic and rhetoric) and classics such as the philosophy of Aristotle, the natural history of Pliny and the geography of Ptolemy. All teaching at the school was in Latin and he would read, write and converse in Latin, and give himself a new Latin name, Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus, Mercator being the Latin translation of Kremer, which means \"merchant\". The Brethren were renowned for their scriptorium, and here Mercator might have encountered the italic script which he employed in his later work. The brethren were also renowned for their thoroughness and discipline, well attested by Erasmus, who had attended the school forty years before Mercator.\nUniversity of Leuven, 1530\u20131532.\nFrom a famous school, Mercator moved to the famous University of Leuven, where his full Latin name appears in the matriculation records for 1530. He lived in one of the teaching colleges, the Castle College, and, although he was classified as a pauper, he rubbed shoulders with richer students, amongst whom were the anatomist Andreas Vesalius, the statesman Antoine Perrenot, and the theologian George Cassander, all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of Mercator.\nThe general first degree (for Magister) centred on the teaching of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative Scholasticism which gave prime place to the authority of Aristotle. Although the trivium was now augmented by the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music), their coverage was neglected in comparison with theology and philosophy and consequently Mercator would have to resort to further study of the first three subjects in years to come. Mercator graduated as Magister in 1532.\nAntwerp, 1532\u20131534.\nThe normal progress for an able magister was to go on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood, but Mercator did not: like many twenty-year-old young men, he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the university and it is quite possible that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately, he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but succeeded only in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.\nDuring this period Mercator was in contact with the Franciscan friar Franciscus Monachus who lived in the monastery of Mechelen. He was a controversial figure who, from time to time, was in conflict with the church authorities because of his humanist outlook and his break from Aristotelian views of the world: his own views of geography were based on investigation and observation. Mercator must have been impressed by Monachus, his map collection and the famous globe that he had prepared for Jean Carondelet, the principal advisor of Charles V. The globe was constructed by the Leuven goldsmith Gaspar van der Heyden (Gaspar a Myrica c.\u20091496\u2013c.\u20091549) with whom Mercator would be apprenticed. These encounters may well have provided the stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography. Later he would say, \"Since my youth, geography has been for me the primary subject of study. I liked not only the description of the Earth but the structure of the whole machinery of the world.\"\nLeuven, 1534\u20131543.\nTowards the end of 1534, the twenty-two-year-old Mercator arrived back in Leuven and threw himself into the study of geography, mathematics and astronomy under the guidance of Gemma Frisius. Mercator was completely out of his depth but, with the help and friendship of Gemma, who was only four years older, he succeeded in mastering the elements of mathematics within two years and the university granted him permission to tutor private students. Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon became adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.\nGemma and Gaspar Van der Heyden had completed a terrestrial globe in 1529, but by 1535 they were planning a new globe embodying the latest geographical discoveries. The gores were to be engraved on copper, instead of wood, and the text was to be in an elegant italic script instead of the heavy Roman lettering of the early globes. The globe was a combined effort: Gemma researched the content, Van der Heyden engraved the geography and Mercator engraved the text, including the cartouche which exhibited his own name in public for the first time. Interestingly, the text of the cartouche attributes the production copyrights to Mercator.The globe was finished in 1536 and its celestial counterpart appeared one year later. These widely admired globes were costly and their wide sales provided Mercator an income which, together with that from mathematical instruments and from teaching, allowed him to marry and establish a home. His marriage to Barbara Schellekens was in September 1536, and Arnold, the first of their six children, was born a year later.\nThe arrival of Mercator on the cartographic scene would have been noted by the cognoscenti who purchased Gemma's globe \u2013 the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor Charles V at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide an important source of income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of Arras, and Antoine's father, Nicholas Perrenot, the chancellor of Charles V.\nWorking alongside Gemma whilst they were producing the globes, Mercator would have witnessed the process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents to work in a burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a map of the Holy Land which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.\nA year later, in 1538, he produced his first map of the world, usually referred to as \"Orbis Imago\". In 1539/40 he made a map of Flanders and in 1541 a terrestrial globe. All four works were received with acclaim and they sold in large numbers. The dedications of three of these works witness Mercator's access to influential patrons: the Holy Land was dedicated to who sat on the Great Council of Mechelen, the map of Flanders was dedicated to the emperor himself and the globe was dedicated to Nicholas Perrenot, the emperor's chief advisor. The dedicatee of the world map was more surprising: Johannes Drosius, a fellow student who, as an unorthodox priest, may well have been suspected of Lutheran heresy. Given that the symbolism of the Orbis Imago map also reflected a Lutheran view point, Mercator was exposing himself to criticism by the hardline theologians of Leuven .\nIn between these works, he found time to write \"Literarum latinarum\", a small instruction manual on the italic script. The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522. It was much favoured by humanist scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or gothic script). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance. The title page of this work is an illustration of the decorative style he developed.\nIn 1542, the thirty-year-old must have been feeling confident about his future prospects when he suffered two major interruptions to his life. First, Leuven was besieged by the troops of the Duke of Cleves, a Lutheran sympathiser who, with French support, was set on exploiting unrest in the Low Countries to his own ends. This was the same Duke to whom Mercator turned ten years later. The siege was lifted but the financial losses to the town and its traders, including Mercator, were great. The second interruption was potentially deadly: the Inquisition called.\nPersecution, 1543.\nAt no time in his life did Mercator claim to be a Lutheran, but there are many hints that he had sympathies in that direction. As a child, called Geert, he was surrounded by adults who were possibly followers of Geert Groote, who placed meditation, contemplation, and biblical study over ritual and liturgy\u2014and who also founded the school of the Brethren of the Common Life at 's-Hertogenbosch. As an adult, Mercator had family connections to Molanus, a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also, he was a close friend and correspondent of Philip Melanchthon, one of the principal Lutheran reformers. Study of the Bible was something that was central to Mercator's life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days, doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the theologians at the university, amongst whom were two senior figures of the Inquisition, Jacobus Latomus and Ruard Tapper. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is no great matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or innocent, provided we terrify the people by these examples; which generally succeeds best, when persons eminent for learning, riches, nobility or high stations, are thus sacrificed.\nIt may well have been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed. His name appeared on a list of 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator, who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse, for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.\nMercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde and imprisoned in the castle. He was accused of suspicious correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well-placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perrenot was helpful is unknown: Perrenot, as a bishop, would have to support the activities of the Inquisition. After seven months, Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.\nLeuven, 1543\u20131552.\nMercator never committed any of his prison experiences to paper; all he would say was that he had suffered an \"unjust persecution\". For the rest of his time in Leuven, his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. They were soon destroyed in the course of the emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result, it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.\nIn 1547 Mercator was visited by the young (nineteen year old) John Dee who, on completion of his undergraduate studies in Cambridge (1547), \"went beyond the seas to speak and confer with some learned men\". Dee and Mercator were both passionately interested in the same topics and they quickly established a close rapport which lasted throughout their lives. In 1548, Dee returned to Leuven (Louvain in Dee's text) and registered as a student: for three years, he was constantly in Mercator's company. Apart from a possible short visit to Duisburg in 1562, the two men did not meet, but they corresponded frequently and by good fortune a number of their letters are preserved. Dee took maps, globes and astronomical instruments back to England and in return furnished Mercator with the latest English texts and new geographical knowledge arising from the English explorations of the world. Forty years later, they were still co-operating, Dee using Mercator's maps to convince the English court to finance Martin Frobisher's expeditions and Mercator still avidly seeking information of new territories.\nThe final success in Leuven was the 1551 celestial globe, the partner of his terrestrial globe of 1541. The records of the Plantin Press show that several hundred pairs of globes were sold before the end of the century despite their high price\u2014in 1570 they sold at 25 carolus guilders for a pair. Celestial globes were a necessary adjunct to the intellectual life of rich patrons and academics alike, for both astronomical and astrological studies, two subjects which were strongly entwined in the sixteenth century. Twenty-two pairs are still in existence.\nDuisburg, 1552\u20131594.\nIn 1552, Mercator, aged 40, moved from Leuven to Duisburg in the Duchy of Cleves (in modern-day Germany), where he spent the rest of his life. He never gave his reasons for the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic intolerance of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; there was to be a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required. He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.\nThe peaceful town of Duisburg, untroubled by political and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly established himself as a man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes. Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a burgher for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve-times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.\nMercator was welcomed by Duke Wilhelm who appointed him as court cosmographer. There is no precise definition of this term other than that it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy but at that time it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the County of Mark and the Duchy of Westphalia.\nAround this time Mercator also received and executed a very special order for the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V: a pair of small globes, the inner (\"fist-size\") Earth was made of wood and the outer celestial sphere was made of blown crystal glass engraved with diamond and inlaid with gold. He presented them to the emperor in Brussels who awarded him the title \"Imperatoris domesticus\" (a member of the Imperial household). The globes are lost but Mercator describes them in to Philip Melanchthon in which he declares that the globes were rotated on the top of an astronomical clock made for Charles V by Juanelo Turriano (Janellus). The clock was provided with eight dials which showed the positions of the moon, stars and planets. The illustration shows a similar clock made by the German craftsman Baldewein at roughly the same time.\nEarlier, Mercator had also presented Charles V with an important pamphlet on the use of globes and instruments and his latest (incorrect) ideas on magnetism: \"Declaratio insigniorum utilitatum quae sunt in globo terrestri : coelesti, et annulo astronomico\" (A description of the most important applications of the terrestrial and celestial globes and the astronomical ring). The first section is prefaced by Mercator's ideas on magnetism, the central thesis being that magnetic compasses are attracted to a single pole (not a dipole) along great circles through that pole. He then shows how to calculate the position of the pole if the deviation is known at two known positions (Leuven and Corvo in the Azores): he finds that it must be at latitude 73\u00b02' and longitude 169\u00b034'. Remarkably, he also calculates the longitude difference between the pole and an arbitrary position: he had solved the longitude problem\u2014if his theory had been correct. Further comments on magnetism may be found in an earlier letter to Perrenot and on the later world map. In the Hogenberg portrait (at the head of the article) his dividers are set on the position of the magnetic pole.\nIn 1554, Mercator published the long-awaited wall map of Europe, dedicating it to his friend, now Cardinal, Antoine Perrenot. He had worked at it for more than twelve years, collecting, comparing, collating and rationalising a vast amount of data and the result was a map of unprecedented detail and accuracy. It \"attracted more praise from scholars everywhere than any similar geographical work which has ever been brought out.\" It also sold in large quantities for much of the rest of the century, with a second edition in 1572 and a third edition in the atlas of 1595.\nThe proposed university in Duisburg failed to materialise because the papal licence to found the university was delayed twelve years and by then Duke Wilhelm had lost interest. It was another 90 years before Duisburg had its university. On the other hand, no papal permit was required to establish the where, in 1559, Mercator was invited to teach mathematics with cosmography. One year later, in 1560, he secured the appointment of his friend Jan Vermeulen (Molanus) as rector and then blessed Vermeulen's marriage to his daughter Emerantia. His sons were now growing to manhood and he encouraged them to embark on his own profession. Arnold, the eldest, had produced his first map (of Iceland) in 1558 and would later take over the day-to-day running of Mercator's enterprises. Bartholemew, his second son, showed great academic promise and in 1562 (aged 22) he took over the teaching of his father's three-year-long lecture course\u2014after Mercator had taught it once only! Much to Mercator's grief, Bartholemew died young, in 1568 (aged 28). Rumold, the third son, would spend a large part of his life in London's publishing houses providing for Mercator a vital link to the new discoveries of the Elizabethan age. In 1587 Rumold returned to Duisburg and later, in 1594, it fell to his lot to publish Mercator's works posthumously.\nIn 1564, Mercator published his map of Britain, a map of greatly improved accuracy which far surpassed any of his previous representations. The circumstances were unusual. It is the only map without a dedicatee and in the text engraved on the map, he pointedly denies responsibility for the map's authorship and claims that he is merely engraving and printing it for a \"very good friend\". The identity of neither the author nor the friend has been established but it has been suggested that the map was created by a Scottish Catholic priest called John Elder who smuggled it to French clergy known to Antoine Perrenot, Mercator's friend. Mercator's reticence shows that he was clearly aware of the political nature of the pro-Catholic map which showed all the Catholic religious foundations and omitted those created by Protestant Henry VIII; moreover, it was engraved with text demeaning the history of England and praising that of Catholic Ireland and Scotland. It was invaluable as an accurate guide for the planned Catholic invasion of England by Philip II of Spain.\nAs soon as the map of Britain was published, Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and mapping of Lorraine (Lotharingia). This was a new venture for him in the sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep-sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper, but he may have confided in his friend Ghim, who would later write: \"The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement as a result of his terrifying experiences.\" Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map was published at the time, but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.\nThe trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a setback for his health, but he soon recovered and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the \"Chronologia\", a list of all significant events since the beginning of the world compiled from his literal reading of the Bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed. Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to Julian dates calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3,965 years before the birth of Christ. This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the Catholic Church placed the work on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of Martin Luther. Had he published such a work in Louvain, he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.\nThe Chronologia developed into an even wider project, the \"Cosmographia\", a description of the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.\nAs the Chronologia was going to press in 1569, Mercator also published what was to become his most famous map: \"Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata\" ('A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation'). As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the Age of Discovery the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a rhumb line) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way, such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works, but modern scholars suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by Pedro Nunes. The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the Mercator projection became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. On the other hand, the projection is clearly unsuitable as a description of the land masses on account of its manifest distortion at high latitudes and its use is now deprecated: other projections are more suitable. Although several hundred copies of the map were produced it soon became out of date as new discoveries showed the extent of Mercator's inaccuracies (of poorly known lands) and speculations (for example, on the arctic and the southern continent).\nAround this time, the marshall of J\u00fclich approached Mercator and asked him to prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the crown prince Johannes. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the British Library under the title Atlas of Europe (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" of Abraham Ortelius.\nApart from a revision of the map of Europe in 1572, there would be no more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia. The first of these was a new definitive version of Ptolemy's maps. That he should wish to do so may seem strange given that, at the same time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend Abraham Ortelius, had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval of almost ten years. It was accepted by scholars as the \"last word\", literally and metaphorically, in a chapter of geography which was closed for good.\nMercator now turned to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of the production of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, the time he had available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.\nIn 1589, at the age of 77, Mercator had a new lease of life. He took a new wife, Gertrude Vierlings, the wealthy widow of a former mayor of Duisburg (and at the same time he arranged the marriage of Rumold to her daughter). A second collection of 22 maps was published covering Italy, Greece and the Balkans. This volume has a noteworthy preface for it includes mention of Atlas as a mythical king of Mauretania. \"I have set this man Atlas,\" explained Mercator, \"so notable for his erudition, humaneness, and wisdom as a model for my imitation.\" A year later, Mercator had a stroke which left him greatly incapacitated. He struggled with the assistance of his family trying to complete the remaining maps, the ongoing theological publications and a new treatise on the Creation of the World. This last work, which he did succeed in finishing, was the climax of his life's activities, the work which, in his own opinion, surpassed all his other endeavours and provided a framework and rationale for the complete atlas. It was also his last work in a literal sense, for he died after two further strokes in 1594.\nEpitaph and legacy.\nMercator was buried in the church of in Duisburg, where a memorial was erected about fifty years after his death. The of the epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as \"the foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing the heaven from the inside and the Earth from the outside ... greatly respected for his wide erudition, particularly in theology, and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life.\" In addition, on the base of the memorial, there is an epigram:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;To the reader: whoever you are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies heavily on the buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden for a man who had the whole weight of her lands on his shoulders and carried her as an Atlas.\nFollowing Mercator's death, his family prepared the Atlas for publication in four months. They hoped for it to become a source of the income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator's account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim's biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator's definition of a new meaning for the word \"Atlas\": \"Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura\" which may be translated as \"Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the fabric of the world and the figure of the fabrick'd\", or, more colloquially, as \"Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.\" Over the years Mercator's definition of \"atlas\" has become simply \"A collection of maps in a volume.\"\nThe atlas was not an immediate success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies, but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602, but only the text was reset; there were no new maps. Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" by Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598, the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.\nThe family was clearly in some financial difficulty for in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1,000 books was sold at a public auction in Leiden (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue perished in the Second World War, but fortunately a manuscript copy had been made by Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987. Of the titles identified, there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on history and geography, 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books. The contents of the library provide an insight into Mercator's intellectual studies but the mathematics books are the only ones to have been subjected to scholarly analysis: they cover arithmetic, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, architecture, fortification, astronomy, astrology, time measurement, calendar calculation, scientific instruments, cartography and applications. Only one of his own copies has been found\u2014a first edition of Copernicus's \"De revolutionibus orbium coelestium\" annotated in Mercator's hand: this is held by Glasgow University.\nThe sale catalogue doesn't mention any maps, but it is known that the family sold the copper plates to Jodocus Hondius in 1604. He transformed the atlas. Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together, although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition, they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor, which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition, the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually, the atlas became out-of-date and by the middle of the seventeenth century, the publications of map-makers such as Joan Blaeu and Frederik de Wit took over.\nMercator's editions of Ptolemy and his theological writings were in print for many years after the demise of the atlas, but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy. His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was Edward Wright who first clarified the method in his book \"Certaine Errors\" (1599)\u2014the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on conventional charts corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout the first half of the seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes. Recently, Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world, but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.\nMany cities have a statue of Mercator. His name has been attached to ships, buildings, universities, insurance companies, small businesses, pizzerias, streets, schools and more. There is a Belgian bank note. There is a German coin and an incorrect postage stamp (showing a construction which is not the Mercator Projection). He has been modelled in sand and giant figures. There is a venomous snail and a beetle. An is named for him.\nThere are two museums dedicated primarily to Mercator:\nWorks.\nGlobes and instruments.\nThe globes by Gemma Frisius and Mercator are discussed in Volume 3 of the History of Cartography (Cartography in the European Renaissance). Chapter 6: \"Globes in Renaissance Europe\" by Elly Dekker. Chapter 44: \"Commercial Cartography and Map Production in the Low Countries, 1500\u2013ca. 1672\" by Cornelis Koeman, G\u00fcnter Schilder, Marco van Egmond, and Peter van der Krogt. The definitive work is \"Globi neerlandici: the production of globes in the Low Countries\" by Peter van der Krogt.\nWholly devised by Frisius who invited Mercator to engrave the text. The only extant example is part of the Schmidt collection held by the Globe Museum (https://) of the Austrian National Library. Another example held at the Gymnasium Francisceum of Zerbst in eastern Germany was destroyed in the Second World War, but there is a full description in Stevenson.\nThe only known example is held by the http:// (formerly the National Maritime Museum). On this globe Mercator's name appears on equal footing with that of Frisius. The globe is also described in Stevenson.\nOver twenty pairs of large (420mm) globes are still in existence. Both of the globes and their un-pasted gores may be examined in high resolution. A full description of the globes may be found online in Stevenson. \nThe terrestrial globe is significant in conjecturing that North America is separated from Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus. Another feature, the shape Mercator ascribed to \"Beach\" and \"Maletur\", later gave rise to speculation that the north coast of Australia had been visited in the early sixteenth century. An inscription on the globe promises: \"Where and for what reasons we have departed from the editions of others, Oh Reader, will be pointed out in our booklet\".\nMercator also added a feature of special value to seamen: from the numerous compass or wind roses he drew rhumb lines rather than great circles. The rhumb lines correspond to constant sailing directions but on the spherical globe they appear as spirals. The globe was manufactured in great numbers but it was never updated. The celestial globe was up to date in using the information provided by Copernicus.\n\"Amplissima Terrae Sanctae descriptio ad utriusque Testamenti intelligentiam.\" (A description of the Holy Land for understanding both testaments). Dedicated to . Size; in 6 sheets. Two copies are extant: one at the library of Perugia and another at the Bibliotheque Nationale de France (link above). Based on a https:// by the lutheran Jacob Ziegler. Mercator's map shows the route of the Israelites from Egypt to the Promised Land. The title discloses a hope of helping people in their Bible studies, a Lutheran notion that would have aroused the suspicions of the inquisition.\n This wall map has no title but it is normally referred to as \"Orbis Imago\" (from the first sentence of the central legend, below). Size: . Dedicated to Johannes Drosius. Two copies extant: one at the American Geographical Society Library (link above), and another at the New York Public Library. The first map identifying North American and South America. The map was a slightly modified copy of a https:// (and its text) by Oronce Fine. The double cordiform projection, may well have been chosen because of its relationship to aspects of Lutheran beliefs. A notice to the reader () at the top of the map says: \"Let America, Sarmatia and India bear witness, Dear Reader, that the image of the world you see here is newer and more correct than those that have been circulated hitherto. We propose with regard to the different parts of the world to treat, successively, particular regions more broadly, as we are already doing with Europe, and you may soon expect a universal map, which will not be inferior to that of Ptolemy. Farewell. 1538\".\n Wall map in 9 sheets. Dedicated to Charles V. This map was commissioned by merchants of Ghent who intended that it should be presented to Charles V in the forlorn hope that it might divert the wrath of the Emperor after their rebellion. It would be a more respectful replacement of by which had stressed the defiant independence of the Flemish cities. The map is remarkably accurate and it is presumed to be based on a triangulation of Flanders by Jacob van Deventer. A single original is extant and may be inspected in the Plantin-Moretus Museum: it also appeared in the atlas of 1585 and in the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" of Abraham Ortelius.\n \"Europae descriptio.\" Wall map on 15 sheets. Dedicated to Antoine Perrenot. No known copy of the whole map has been discovered but several copies of the map were cut and re-assembled (by Mercator) for inclusion in the unique Atlas of Europe from 1570\u201372, for example the map of Spain on pages 7 and 8 but not the map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 which is taken from the 1569 world map. They are available in facsimile. The map used a cordiform projection. It was revised by Mercator in 1572 and again by Rumold for the 1595 atlas. The 1595 map uses a different projection.\n \"Anglia &amp; Scotiae &amp; Hibernie nova descriptio.\" Wall map on 8 sheets. Mercator states that a friend, possibly Antoine Perrenot, had requested that he engrave this map from a manuscript copy, possibly by John Elder, a disaffected Scottish Catholic priest. Several copies of this map were cut and re-assembled for the atlas of Europe. The map is oriented with west at the top. 4 copies known.\n A map commissioned by Duke Ren\u00e9 of Lorraine. The single copy of the map was never published but two detailed maps of Lorraine (north and south) appear in the Atlas of 1585.\nA unique collection of maps assembled in the early 1570s, many of which are assembled from portions of Mercator's earlier maps: 9 constructed from Europe (1554), 6 from British Isles (1564) and 2 from the world map (1569). The map of Europe on pages 1 and 2 is taken from the 1569 world map. There are also 2 manuscript maps of Mercator and 13 maps are from the \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\" of Abraham Ortelius.) Note that Mercator did not term this collection of maps an atlas.\n \"Tabulae geographicae Cl. Ptolemaei ad mentem auctoris restitutis ac emendatis.\" (Geographic maps according to Claudius Ptolemy, drawn in the spirit of the author and expanded by Gerard Mercator) Mercator's definitive version of Ptolemy's 28 maps. A second edition including the revised text of \"Geographia\" was published in 1584. \"Geographiae Libri Octo : recogniti iam et diligenter emendati.\" Example map: https://\nThe first collection of 51 modern maps: 16 of France (with Switzerland), 9 corresponding to Belgium and the Netherlands and 26 of Germany. The three sections, each with a title page, dedication and supporting text, were sold together and separately. (Mercator did not term this collection of maps as an atlas.)\nA second collection of 23 modern maps: 16 of Italy (including Corsica), 3 of Styria and the other Balkan countries, 4 of Greece. (Once again Mercator did not term this collection of maps as an atlas but in the preface he introduces Atlas as a mythical King of Mauretania\u2014a learned philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, credited with the making of the first globe.) This collection has a dedication to Prince Ferdinando de' Medici to whom Mercator attributes ancestry from King Atlas.\n\"Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura.\" (Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.) This is the first time that the name Atlas is used as a title of a collection of maps. Many library copies are https://. There are also a number of freely available digital volumes such as those at the https:// and http:// (University of Pittsburgh). High resolution facsimiles were made available by Octavo Publications (now defunct) but their CD is still available from retailers; the CD is accompanied by an introduction to the atlas by and a translation of all the text and both of these are freely available in an https:// from the New York Society Library.\nThe atlas includes further 28 maps: 16 of Britain, 4 of Denmark and one each of the polar regions, Iceland, Norway with Sweden, Prussia, Livonia, Russia, Lithuania, Transylvania and Crimea. This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who had spent much of his working life in London. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.\nLess than half the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not supporting it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans for the rest of the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, \"De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber\" (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.\nThe second part of the Atlas contains the maps but each section has its own title page, dedication and preface, and every country is succinctly supplemented by text describing a mixture of history, royal genealogy, ecclesiastical hierarchies, list of universities and occasionally facets of contemporary economy. Every place mentioned in the text is given its geographic coordinates to the nearest minute.\nAs an example of the textual content the section on the British Isles mentions (amongst other things): alternative names; the etymology of \"British\" and its relation to woad painted tribes; climate; lack of snakes; the seemly manners of the populace; coroners and ecclesiastical courts; lists of counties, bishoprics and universities; the structure of aristocracy; and much more, even a list of recommended reading.\nFrans Hogenberg portrait text.\nFrans Hogenberg was a close friend of Mercator. His portrait features prominently at the beginning of the Atlas. The text around the portrait is&lt;br&gt; \n\"Magna Pelusiacis debetur gratia chartis// Magna tibi priscum tandem superasse laborem// Mercator, tractusque novos, terraeque, marisque// Monstrasse, et magnum quod continent omnia caelum. I.

{"id": "61003", "revid": "612852", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61003", "title": "Prototype-based programming", "text": "Style of object-oriented programming in which inheritance is based on reusing objects\nPrototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behavior reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as \"prototypal\", \"prototype-oriented,\" \"classless\", or \"instance-based\" programming.\nPrototype-based programming uses the process generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended. Using fruit as an example, a \"fruit\" object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general. A \"banana\" object would be cloned from the \"fruit\" object and general properties specific to bananas would be appended. Each individual \"banana\" object would be cloned from the generic \"banana\" object. Compare to the class-based paradigm, where a \"fruit\" \"class\" would be extended by a \"banana\" \"class\".\nHistory.\nThe first prototype-based programming languages were Director a.k.a. Ani (on top of MacLisp) (1976-1979), and contemporaneously and not independently, ThingLab (on top of Smalltalk) (1977-1981), respective PhD projects by Kenneth Michael Kahn at MIT and Alan Hamilton Borning at Stanford (but working with Alan Kay at Xerox PARC). Borning introduced the word \"prototype\" in this context in his 1981 paper in \"ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS)\". Note however, that these were both inspired by Winograd and Bobrow's KRL by (1975-1976), who introduced the words and concepts of \"prototype\" and (multiple) \"inheritance\" in the related context of \"Knowledge Representation\"\u2014for data rather than programs as such\u2014itself based on Minsky's 1974 concept of Frames. The first prototype-based programming language with more than one implementer was probably Yale T Scheme (1981-1984), though like Director and ThingLab initially, it just speaks of objects without classes. The language that made the name and notion of prototypes popular was Self (1985-1995), developed by David Ungar and Randall Smith to research topics in object-oriented language design.\nSince the late 1990s, the classless paradigm has grown increasingly popular. Some current prototype-oriented languages are JavaScript (and other ECMAScript implementations such as JScript and Flash's ActionScript 1.0), Lua, Cecil, NewtonScript, Io, Ioke, MOO, REBOL and AHK.\nSince the 2010s, a new generation of languages with pure functional prototypes has appeared, that reduce OOP to its very core: Jsonnet is a dynamic lazy pure functional language with a builtin prototype object system using mixin inheritance; Nix is a dynamic lazy pure functional language that builds an equivalent object system (Nix \"extensions\") in just two short function definitions (plus many other convenience functions). Both languages are used to define large distributed software configurations (Jsonnet being directly inspired by GCL, the Google Configuration Language, with which Google defines all its deployments, and has similar semantics though with dynamic binding of variables). Since then, other languages like Gerbil Scheme have implemented pure functional lazy prototype systems based on similar principles.\nDesign and implementation.\nEtymologically, a \"prototype\" means \"first cast\" (\"cast\" in the sense of being manufactured). A prototype is a concrete thing, from which other objects can be created by copying and modifying. For example, the International Prototype of the Kilogram is an actual object that really exists, from which new kilogram-objects can be created by copying. In comparison, a \"class\" is an abstract thing, in which objects can belong. For example, all kilogram-objects are in the class of KilogramObject, which might be a subclass of MetricObject, and so on.\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You make prototype objects, and then \u2026 make new instances. Objects are mutable in JavaScript, so we can augment the new instances, giving them new fields and methods. These can then act as prototypes for even newer objects. We don't need classes to make lots of similar objects\u2026 Objects inherit from objects. What could be more object oriented than that?\nAdvocates of prototype-based programming argue that it encourages the programmer to focus on the behavior of some set of examples and only later worry about classifying these objects into archetypal objects that are later used in a fashion similar to classes. Many prototype-based systems encourage the alteration of prototypes during run-time, whereas only very few class-based object-oriented systems (such as the dynamic object-oriented system, Common Lisp, Dylan, Objective-C, Perl, Python, Ruby, or Smalltalk) allow classes to be altered during the execution of a program.\nAlmost all prototype-based systems are based on interpreted and dynamically typed languages. Systems based on statically typed languages are technically feasible, however. The Omega language discussed in \"Prototype-Based Programming\" is an example of such a system, though according to Omega's website even Omega is not exclusively static, but rather its \"compiler may choose to use static binding where this is possible and may improve the efficiency of a program.\"\nObject construction.\nIn prototype-based languages there are no explicit classes. Objects inherit directly from other objects through a prototype property. The prototype property is called codice_1 in Self and JavaScript, or codice_2 in Io. There are two methods of constructing new objects: \"ex nihilo\" (\"from nothing\") object creation or through \"cloning\" an existing object. The former is supported through some form of object literal, declarations where objects can be defined at runtime through special syntax such as codice_3 and passed directly to a variable. While most systems support a variety of cloning, \"ex nihilo\" object creation is not as prominent.\nIn class-based languages, a new instance is constructed through a class's constructor function, a special function that reserves a block of memory for the object's members (properties and methods) and returns a reference to that block. An optional set of constructor arguments can be passed to the function and are usually held in properties. The resulting instance will inherit all the methods and properties that were defined in the class, which acts as a kind of template from which similarly typed objects can be constructed.\nSystems that support \"ex nihilo\" object creation allow new objects to be created from scratch without cloning from an existing prototype. Such systems provide a special syntax for specifying the properties and behaviors of new objects without referencing existing objects. In many prototype languages there exists a root object, often called \"Object\", which is set as the default prototype for all other objects created in run-time and which carries commonly needed methods such as a codice_4 function to return a description of the object as a string. One useful aspect of \"ex nihilo\" object creation is to ensure that a new object's slot (properties and methods) names do not have namespace conflicts with the top-level \"Object\" object. (In the JavaScript language, one can do this by using a null prototype, i.e. codice_5.)\n\"Cloning\" refers to a process whereby a new object is constructed by copying the behavior of an existing object (its prototype). The new object then carries all the qualities of the original. From this point on, the new object can be modified. In some systems the resulting child object maintains an explicit link (via \"delegation\" or \"resemblance\") to its prototype, and changes in the prototype cause corresponding changes to be apparent in its clone. Other systems, such as the Forth-like programming language Kevo, do not propagate change from the prototype in this fashion and instead follow a more \"concatenative\" model where changes in cloned objects do not automatically propagate across descendants.\n// Example of true prototypal inheritance style in JavaScript.\n// Object creation using the literal object notation {}.\nconst foo = { name: \"foo\", one: 1, two: 2 };\n// Another object.\nconst bar = { two: \"two\", three: 3 };\n// Object.setPrototypeOf() is a method introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\n// For the sake of simplicity, let us pretend that the following\n// line works regardless of the engine used:\nObject.setPrototypeOf(bar, foo); // foo is now the prototype of bar.\n// If we try to access foo's properties from bar from now on, \n// we'll succeed. \nbar.one; // Resolves to 1.\n// The child object's properties are also accessible.\nbar.three; // Resolves to 3.\n// Own properties shadow prototype properties.\nbar.two; // Resolves to \"two\".\nbar.name; // Unaffected, resolves to \"foo\".\nfoo.name; // Resolves to \"foo\".\nFor another example:\nconst foo = { one: 1, two: 2 };\n// bar.prototype = foo\nconst bar = Object.create(foo);\nbar.three = 3;\nbar.one; // 1\nbar.two; // 2\nbar.three; // 3\nDelegation.\nIn prototype-based languages that use \"delegation\", the language runtime is capable of dispatching the correct method or finding the right piece of data simply by following a series of delegation pointers (from object to its prototype) until a match is found. All that is required to establish this behavior-sharing between objects is the delegation pointer. Unlike the relationship between class and instance in class-based object-oriented languages, the relationship between the prototype and its offshoots does not require that the child object have a memory or structural similarity to the prototype beyond this link. As such, the child object can continue to be modified and amended over time without rearranging the structure of its associated prototype as in class-based systems. It is also important to note that not only data, but also methods can be added or changed. For this reason, some prototype-based languages refer to both data and methods as \"slots\" or \"members\".\nConcatenation.\nIn \"concatenative\" prototyping - the approach implemented by the Kevo programming language - there are no visible pointers or links to the original prototype from which an object is cloned. The prototype (parent) object is copied rather than linked to and there is no delegation. As a result, changes to the prototype will not be reflected in cloned objects. Incidentally, the Cosmos programming language achieves the same through the use of persistent data structures.\nThe main conceptual difference under this arrangement is that changes made to a prototype object are not automatically propagated to clones. This may be seen as an advantage or disadvantage. (However, Kevo does provide additional primitives for publishing changes across sets of objects based on their similarity \u2014 so-called \"family resemblances\" or \"clone family\" mechanism \u2014 rather than through taxonomic origin, as is typical in the delegation model.) It is also sometimes claimed that delegation-based prototyping has an additional disadvantage in that changes to a child object may affect the later operation of the parent. However, this problem is not inherent to the delegation-based model and does not exist in delegation-based languages such as JavaScript, which ensure that changes to a child object are always recorded in the child object itself and never in parents (i.e. the child's value shadows the parent's value rather than changing the parent's value).\nIn simplistic implementations, concatenative prototyping will have faster member lookup than delegation-based prototyping (because there is no need to follow the chain of parent objects), but will conversely use more memory (because all slots are copied, rather than there being a single slot pointing to the parent object). More sophisticated implementations can avoid this problem, however, although trade-offs between speed and memory are required. For example, systems with concatenative prototyping can use a copy-on-write implementation to allow for behind-the-scenes data sharing \u2014 and such an approach is indeed followed by Kevo. Conversely, systems with delegation-based prototyping can use caching to speed up data lookup.\nCriticism.\nAdvocates of class-based object models who criticize prototype-based systems often have concerns similar to the concerns that proponents of static type systems for programming languages have of dynamic type systems (see datatype). Usually, such concerns involve correctness, safety, predictability, efficiency and programmer unfamiliarity.\nOn the first three points, classes are often seen as analogous to types (in most statically typed object-oriented languages they serve that role) and are proposed to provide contractual guarantees to their instances, and to users of their instances, that they will behave in some given fashion.\nRegarding efficiency, declaring classes simplifies many compiler optimizations that allow developing efficient method and instance-variable lookup. For the Self language, much development time was spent on developing, compiling, and interpreting techniques to improve the performance of prototype-based systems versus class-based systems.\nA common criticism made against prototype-based languages is that the community of software developers is unfamiliar with them, despite the popularity and market permeation of JavaScript. However, knowledge about prototype-based systems is increasing with the proliferation of JavaScript frameworks and the complex use of JavaScript as the World Wide Web (Web) matures. ECMAScript 6 introduced classes as syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance, providing an alternative way to create objects and manage inheritance.\nLanguages supporting prototype-based programming.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was long credited as being the discoverer of the geographic North Pole in April 1909, having led the first expedition to have claimed this achievement, although it is now considered unlikely that he actually reached the Pole.\nPeary was born in Cresson, Pennsylvania, but, following his father's death at a young age, was raised in Cape Elizabeth, Maine. He attended Bowdoin College, then joined the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey as a draftsman. He enlisted in the navy in 1881 as a civil engineer. In 1885, he was made chief of surveying for the Nicaragua Canal, which was never built. He visited the Arctic for the first time in 1886, making an unsuccessful attempt to cross Greenland by dogsled. In the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892, he was much better prepared, and by reaching Independence Fjord in what is now known as Peary Land, he proved conclusively that Greenland was an island. He was one of the first Arctic explorers to study Inuit survival techniques. During an expedition in 1894, he was the first Western explorer to reach the Cape York meteorite and its fragments, which were then taken from the native Inuit population who had relied on it for creating tools. During that expedition, Peary deceived six indigenous individuals, including Minik Wallace, into traveling to the United States with him by promising they would be able to return with tools, weapons and gifts within the year. This promise was unfulfilled and four of the six Inuit died of illnesses within a few months.\nOn his 1898\u20131902 expedition, Peary set a new \"Farthest North\" record by reaching Greenland's northernmost point, Cape Morris Jesup. Peary made two more expeditions to the Arctic, in 1905\u20131906 and in 1908\u20131909. During the latter, he claimed to have reached the North Pole. Peary received several learned society awards during his lifetime, and, in 1911, received the Thanks of Congress and was promoted to rear admiral. He served two terms as president of the Explorers Club before retiring in 1911.\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole was widely debated along with a competing claim made by Frederick Cook, but eventually won widespread acceptance. In 1989, British explorer Wally Herbert concluded Peary did not reach the pole, although he may have come within .\nEarly life, education, and career.\nRobert Edwin Peary was born on May 6, 1856, in Cresson, Pennsylvania, to Charles N. and Mary P. Peary. After his father died in 1859, Peary and his mother moved to Portland, Maine. Peary attended Portland High School (Maine) where he graduated in 1873. Peary made his way to Bowdoin College, some to the northeast, where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. He was also part of the rowing team. He graduated in 1877 with a civil engineering degree.\nFrom 1878 to 1879, Peary lived in Fryeburg, Maine. During that time, he made a profile survey from the top of Fryeburg's Jockey Cap Rock. The 360-degree survey names the larger hills and mountains visible from the summit. After Peary's death, his boyhood friend, Alfred E. Burton, suggested that the profile survey be made into a monument. It was cast in bronze and set atop a granite cylinder and erected to his memory by the Peary family in 1938.\nAfter college, Peary worked as a draftsman making technical drawings at the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey office in Washington, D.C. He joined the United States Navy and on October 26, 1881, was commissioned in the Civil Engineer Corps, with the relative rank of lieutenant. From 1884 to 1885, he was an assistant engineer on the surveys for the Nicaragua Canal and later became the engineer in charge. As reflected in a diary entry he made in 1885, during his time in the Navy, he resolved to be the first man to reach the North Pole.\nIn April 1886, he wrote a paper for the National Academy of Sciences proposing two methods for crossing Greenland's ice cap. One was to start from the west coast and trek about to the east coast. The second, more difficult path, was to start from Whale Sound at the top of the known portion of Baffin Bay and travel north to determine whether Greenland was an island or if it extended all the way across the Arctic. Peary was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander on January 5, 1901, and to commander on April 6, 1902.\nInitial Arctic expeditions.\nPeary made his first expedition to the Arctic in 1886, intending to cross Greenland by dog sled, taking the first of his own suggested paths. He was given six months' leave from the Navy, and he received $500 from his mother to book passage north and buy supplies. He sailed on a whaler to Greenland, arriving in Godhavn on June 6, 1886. Peary wanted to make a solo trek, but Christian Maigaard, a young Danish official, convinced him he would die if he went out alone. Maigaard and Peary set off together and traveled nearly due east before turning back because they were short on food. This was the second-farthest penetration of Greenland's ice sheet at the time. Peary returned home knowing more of what was required for long-distance ice trekking.\nBack in Washington attending with the US Navy, in November 1887 Peary was ordered to survey likely routes for a proposed Nicaragua Canal. To complete his tropical outfit he needed a sun hat. He went to a men's clothing store where he met 21-year-old Matthew Henson, a black man working as a sales clerk. Learning that Henson had six years of seagoing experience as a cabin boy, Peary immediately hired him as a personal valet.\nOn assignment in the jungles of Nicaragua, Peary told Henson of his dream of Arctic exploration. Henson accompanied Peary on every one of his subsequent Arctic expeditions, becoming his field assistant and \"first man\", a critical member of his team.\nSecond Greenland expedition.\nIn the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892, Peary took the second, more difficult route that he laid out in 1886: traveling farther north to find out whether Greenland was a larger landmass extending to the North Pole. He was financed by several groups, including the American Geographic Society, the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences (now the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University), and the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences. Members of this expedition included Peary's aide Henson, Frederick A. Cook, who served as the group's surgeon; the expedition's ethnologist, Norwegian skier Eivind Astrup; bird expert and marksman Langdon Gibson, and John M. Verhoeff, who was a weatherman and mineralogist. Peary also took his wife, Josephine, along as dietitian, though she had no formal training. Newspaper reports criticized Peary for bringing his wife.\nOn June 6, 1891, the party left Brooklyn, New York, in the seal hunting ship SS \"Kite\". In July, as \"Kite\" was ramming through sheets of surface ice, the ship's iron tiller suddenly spun around and broke Peary's lower right leg; both bones snapped between the knee and ankle. Peary was unloaded with the rest of the supplies at a camp they called Red Cliff, at the mouth of MacCormick Fjord at the north west end of Inglefield Gulf. A dwelling was built for his recuperation during the next six months. Josephine Peary stayed with Peary. Gibson, Cook, Verhoeff, and Astrup hunted game by boat and became familiar with the area and the Inuit.\nUnlike most previous explorers, Peary had studied Inuit survival techniques; he built igloos during the expedition and dressed in practical furs in the native fashion. By wearing furs to preserve body heat and building igloos, he was able to dispense with the extra weight of tents and sleeping bags when on the march. Peary also relied on the Inuit as hunters and dog-drivers on his expeditions. He pioneered the system of using support teams and establishing supply caches for Arctic travel, which he called the \"Peary system\". The Inuit were curious about the Americans and came to visit Red Cliff. Josephine was bothered by the Inuit body odor from not bathing, their flea infestations, and their food. She studied the people and kept a journal of her experiences. In September 1891, Peary's men and dog sled teams pushed inland onto the ice sheet to lay caches of supplies. They did not go farther than from Red Cliff.\nPeary's leg mended by February 1892. By April 1892, he made some short trips with Josephine and an Inuk dog sled driver to native villages to purchase supplies. On May 3, 1892, Peary finally set out on the intended trek with Henson, Gibson, Cook, and Astrup. After , Peary continued on with Astrup. They found the high view from Navy Cliff, saw Independence Fjord, and concluded that Greenland was an island, and not connected to some yet unknown landmass further north in the Arctic. They trekked back to Red Cliff and arrived on August 6, having traveled a total of .\nIn 1896, Peary, a Master Mason, received his degrees in Kane Lodge No. 454, New York City.\n1898\u20131902 expeditions.\nAs a result of Peary's 1898\u20131902 expedition, he claimed an 1899 visual discovery of \"Jesup Land\" west of Ellesmere Island. He claimed that this sighting of Axel Heiberg Island was prior to its discovery by Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup's expedition around the same time. This contention has been universally rejected by exploration societies and historians. However, the American Geographical Society and the Royal Geographical Society of London honored Peary for tenacity, mapping of previously uncharted areas, and his discovery in 1900 of Cape Morris Jesup at the north tip of Greenland. Peary also achieved a \"farthest north\" for the western hemisphere in 1902 north of Canada's Ellesmere Island. Peary was promoted to lieutenant commander in the Navy in 1901 and to commander in 1902.\n1905\u20131906 expedition.\nPeary's next expedition was supported by fundraising through the Peary Arctic Club, with gifts of $50,000 from George Crocker, the youngest son of banker Charles Crocker, and $25,000 from Morris K. Jesup, to buy Peary a new ship. The navigated through the ice between Greenland and Ellesmere Island, establishing an American hemisphere \"farthest north by ship\". The 1906 \"Peary System\" dogsled drive for the pole across the rough sea ice of the Arctic Ocean started from the north tip of Ellesmere at 83\u00b0 north latitude. The parties made well under a day until they became separated by a storm.\nAs a result, Peary was without a companion sufficiently trained in navigation to verify his account from that point northward. With insufficient food, and uncertainty whether he could negotiate the ice between himself and land, he made the best possible dash and barely escaped with his life from the melting ice. On April 20, he was no farther north than 86\u00b030' latitude. This latitude was never published by Peary. It is in a typescript of his April 1906 diary, discovered by Wally Herbert in his assessment commissioned by the National Geographic Society. The typescript suddenly stopped there, one day before Peary's April 21 purported \"farthest\". The original of the April 1906 record is the only missing diary of Peary's exploration career. He claimed the next day to have achieved a Farthest North world record at 87\u00b006' and returned to 86\u00b030' without camping. This implied a trip of at least between sleeping, even assuming direct travel with no detours.\nAfter returning to \"Roosevelt\" in May, Peary began weeks of difficult travel in June heading west along the shore of Ellesmere. He discovered Cape Colgate, from whose summit he claimed in his 1907 book that he had seen a previously undiscovered far-north \"Crocker Land\" to the northwest on June 24, 1906. A later review of his diary for this time and place found that he had written, \"No land visible.\" On December 15, 1906, the National Geographic Society of the United States, certified Peary's 1905\u20131906 expedition and \"Farthest\" with its highest honor, the Hubbard Medal. No major professional geographical society followed suit. In 1914, Donald Baxter MacMillan and Fitzhugh Green, Sr.'s expedition found that Crocker Land did not exist.\nReaching the North Pole.\nOn July 6, 1908, the \"Roosevelt\" departed New York City with Peary's eighth Arctic expedition of 22 men. Besides Peary as expedition commander, it included master of the \"Roosevelt\" Robert Bartlett, surgeon Dr. J.W. Goodsell, along with Ross Gilmore Marvin, Donald Baxter MacMillan, George Borup, and Matthew Henson. After recruiting several Inuit and their families at Cape York (Greenland), the expedition wintered near Cape Sheridan on Ellesmere Island. The expedition used the \"Peary system\" for the sledge journey, with Bartlett and the Inuit, Poodloonah, \"Harrigan,\" and Ooqueah, composing the pioneer division. Borup, with three Inuit, Keshunghaw, Seegloo, and Karko, composed the advance supporting party. On February 15, Bartlett's pioneer division departed the \"Roosevelt\" for Cape Columbia, followed by 5 advance divisions. Peary, with the two Inuit, Arco and Kudlooktoo, departed on February 22, bringing to the total effort 7 expedition members, 19 Inuit, 140 dogs, and 28 sledges. On February 28, Bartlett, with three Inuit, Ooqueah, Pooadloonah, and Harrigan, accompanied by Borup, with three Inuit, Karko, Seegloo, and Keshungwah, headed North.\nOn March 14, the first supporting party, composed of Dr. Goodsell and the two Inuit, Arco and Wesharkoupsi, turned back towards the ship. Peary states this was at a latitude of 84\u00b029'. On March 20, Borup's third supporting party, with three Inuit, started back to the ship. Peary states this was at a latitude of 85\u00b023'. On March 26, Marvin, with Kudlooktoo and Harrigan, headed back to the ship, from a latitude estimated by Marvin as 86\u00b038'. Marvin died on this return trip south. On 1 April, Bartlett's party started their return to the ship, after Bartlett estimated a latitude of 87\u00b046'49\". Peary, with two Inuit, Egingwah and Seeglo, and Henson, with two Inuit, Ootah and Ooqueah, using 5 sledges and 40 dogs, planned 5 marches over the estimated 130 nautical miles to the pole. On 2 April, Peary led the way north.\nOn the final stage of the journey toward the North Pole, Peary told Bartlett to stay behind. He continued with five others: Henson, Ootah, Egigingwah, Seegloo, and Ooqueah. No one except Henson, who had served on the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892, had experience of naval-type observations. On April 6, 1909, Peary established Camp Jesup within of the pole, according to his own readings. Peary estimated the latitude as 89\u00b057', after making an observation at approximate local noon using the Columbia meridian. Peary used a sextant, with a mercury trough and glass roof for an artificial horizon, to make measurements of the Sun. Peary claims, \"I had now taken in all thirteen single, or six and one-half double, altitudes of the sun, at two different stations, in three different directions, at four different times.\" Peary states some of these observations were \"beyond the Pole,\" and \"...at some moment during these marches and counter-marches, I had passed over or very near the point where north and south and east and west blend into one.\" Henson scouted ahead to what was thought to be the North Pole site; he returned with the greeting, \"I think I'm the first man to sit on top of the world,\" much to Peary's chagrin.\nOn April 7, 1909, Peary's group started their return journey, reaching Cape Columbia on April 23, and the \"Roosevelt\" on April 26. MacMillan and the doctor's party had reached the ship earlier, on March 21, Borup's party on April 11, Marvin's Inuit on April 17, and Bartlett's party on April 24. On July 18, the \"Roosevelt\" departed for home.\nUpon returning, Peary learned that Dr. Frederick A. Cook, a surgeon and ethnographer on the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u20131892, claimed to have reached the North pole in 1908. Despite remaining doubts, a committee of the National Geographic Society, as well as the Naval Affairs Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives, credited Peary with reaching the North Pole.\nA reassessment of Peary's notebook in 1988 by polar explorer Wally Herbert found it \"lacking in essential data\", thus renewing doubts about Peary's discovery.\nLater life and death.\nPeary was promoted to the rank of captain in the Navy in October 1910. By his lobbying, Peary headed off a move among some U.S. Congressmen to have his claim to the pole evaluated by other explorers. Eventually recognized by Congress for \"reaching\" the pole, Peary was given the Thanks of Congress by a special act in March 1911. By the same Act of Congress, Peary was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in the Navy Civil Engineer Corps, retroactive to April 6, 1909. He retired from the Navy the same day, to Eagle Island on the coast of Maine, in the town of Harpswell. His home there has been designated a Maine State Historic Site.\nAfter retiring, Peary received many honors from scientific societies for his Arctic explorations and discoveries. He served twice as president of the Explorers Club, from 1909 to 1911, and from 1913 to 1916.\nIn early 1916, Peary became chairman of the National Aerial Coast Patrol Commission, a private organization created by the Aero Club of America. It advocated the use of aircraft to detect warships and submarines off the U.S. coast. Peary used his celebrity to promote the use of military and naval aviation, which led directly to the formation of United States Navy Reserve aerial coastal patrol units during World War I. After the war, Peary proposed a system of eight airmail routes, which became the genesis of the U.S. Postal Service's airmail system.\nIn 1914, Peary bought the house at 1831 Wyoming Avenue NW in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where he lived until his death on February 20, 1920. He began renovating the house in 1920, shortly before his death, after which the renovation was taken over by Josephine. She sold the house in 1927, receiving a $12,000 promissory note.\nHe was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Matthew Henson was honored by being re-interred nearby on April 6, 1988.\nMarriage and family.\nOn August 11, 1888, Peary married Josephine Diebitsch, a business school valedictorian who thought that women should be more than just mothers. Diebitsch had started working at the Smithsonian Institution when she was 19 or 20 years old, replacing her father after he became ill and filling his position as a linguist. In 1886, she resigned from the Smithsonian upon becoming engaged to Peary.\nThe newlyweds honeymooned in Atlantic City, New Jersey, then moved to Philadelphia, where Peary was assigned. Peary's mother accompanied them on their honeymoon, and she moved into their Philadelphia apartment, which caused friction between the two women. Josephine told Peary that his mother should return to live in Maine.\nThey had two children together, Marie Ahnighito (born 1893) and Robert Peary Jr. His daughter wrote several books, including \"The Red Caboose\" (1932) a children's book about the Arctic adventures published by William Morrow and Company. As an explorer, Peary was frequently gone for years at a time. In their first 23 years of marriage, he spent only three with his wife and family.\nPeary and his aide, Henson, both had relationships with Inuit women outside of marriage and fathered children with them. Peary appears to have started a relationship with Aleqasina (\"Alakahsingwah\") when she was about 14 years old. They had at least two children, including a son called Kaala, Karree, or Kali. French explorer and ethnologist Jean Malaurie was the first to report on Peary's descendants after spending a year in Greenland in 1951\u201352.\nS. Allen Counter, a Harvard neuroscience professor interested in Henson's role in the Arctic expeditions, went to Greenland in 1986. He found Peary's son Kali and Henson's son Anaukaq, then octogenarians, and some of their descendants. Counter arranged to bring the men and their families to the United States to meet their American relatives and see their fathers' gravesites. In 1991, Counter wrote about the episode in his book, \"North Pole Legacy: Black, White, and Eskimo\" (1991). He also gained national recognition of Henson's role in the expeditions. A documentary by the same name was also released. Wally Herbert also noted the relationship and children in his book \"The Noose of Laurels\", published in 1989.\nTreatment of the Inuit.\nPeary has received criticism for his treatment of the Inuit, including fathering children with Aleqasina. Ren\u00e9e Hulan and Lyle Dick have both reported that Peary and his crew sexually exploited Inuit women on his 1908\u20131909 expedition. Peary has also been harshly criticized for bringing back a group of Inughuit Greenlandic Inuit to the United States along with the Cape York meteorite. The meteorite was of significant local economic importance: Although the Greenlanders had been obtaining the iron they needed from whalers, the Cape York meteorite was the only source of iron for tools. Peary sold it for $40,000 in 1897.\nWorking at the American Museum of Natural History, anthropologist Franz Boas had requested that Peary bring back an Inuk for study. During his expedition to retrieve the meteorite, Peary convinced six people, including a man named Qisuk and his child Minik, to travel to America with him by promising they would be able to return with tools, weapons and gifts within the year. Peary left the people at the museum when he returned with the meteorite in 1897, where they were kept in damp, humid conditions unlike their homeland. Within a few months, four died of tuberculosis; their remains were dissected and the bones of Qisuk were put on display after Minik was shown a fake burial.\nSpeaking as a teenager to the \"San Francisco Examiner\" about Peary, Minik said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPeary eventually helped Minik travel home in 1909, though it is speculated that this was to avoid any bad press surrounding his anticipated celebratory return after reaching the North Pole. In 1986, Kenn Harper wrote a book about Minik, entitled \"Give Me My Father's Body\". Convinced that the remains of Qisuk and the three adult Inuit should be returned to Greenland, he tried to persuade the Museum of Natural History to do this, as well as working through the \"red tape\" of the US and Canadian governments. In 1993, Harper succeeded in having the Inuit remains returned. In Qaanaaq, he witnessed the Inuit funeral ceremony for the remains of Qisuk and the three tribesmen [Shaman Atangana (ca. 1840\u20131898) with her husband, renowned hunter Nuktaq (ca. 1848\u20131898), and their adoptive daughter Aviaq (ca. 1885\u20131898)] that had been taken to New York.\nPeary had employed the Inughuit in his expeditions for more than a decade, paying them in firearms, ammunition and other Western goods on which they had come to rely, and leaving them in a dire situation in 1909. The demands of the American expeditions had also resulted in the caribou of North Greenland being hunted to near extinction.\nControversy surrounding North Pole claim.\nPeary's claim to have reached the North Pole has long been subject to doubt. Some polar historians believe that Peary honestly thought he had reached the pole. Others have suggested that he was guilty of deliberately exaggerating his accomplishments. Peary's account has been newly criticized by Pierre Berton (2001) and Bruce Henderson (2005).\nLack of independent validation.\nPeary did not submit his evidence for review to neutral national or international parties or to other explorers. Peary's claim was certified by the National Geographic Society (NGS) in 1909 after a cursory examination of Peary's records, as NGS was a major sponsor of his expedition. This was a few weeks before Cook's Pole claim was rejected by a Danish panel of explorers and navigational experts.\nThe National Geographic Society limited access to Peary's records. At the time, his proofs were not made available for scrutiny by other professionals, as had been done by the Danish panel. Gilbert Hovey Grosvenor persuaded the United States National Academy of Sciences not to get involved. The Royal Geographical Society (RGS) of London gave Peary a one-off medal (created by sculptor Kathleen Scott, later widow of Robert Falcon Scott), in 1910, despite internal council splits which only became known in the 1970s. The RGS based their decision on the belief that the NGS had performed a serious scrutiny of the \"proofs\", which was not the case. Neither the American Geographical Society nor any of the geographical societies of semi-Arctic Scandinavia has recognized Peary's North Pole claim.\nCriticisms.\nOmissions in navigational documentation.\nThe party that accompanied Peary on the final stage of the journey did not include anyone trained in navigation who could either confirm or contradict Peary's own navigational work. This was further exacerbated by Peary's failure to produce records of observed data for steering, for the direction (\"variation\") of the compass, for his longitudinal position at any time, or for zeroing-in on the pole either latitudinally or transversely beyond Bartlett Camp.\nInconsistent speeds.\nThe last five marches when Peary was accompanied by a navigator (Capt. Bob Bartlett) averaged no better than marching north. But once the last support party turned back at \"Camp Bartlett\", where Bartlett was ordered southward, at least from the pole, Peary's claimed speeds immediately doubled for the five marches to Camp Jesup. The recorded speeds quadrupled during the two and a half-day return to Camp Bartlett\u00a0\u2013 at which point his speed slowed drastically. Peary's account of a beeline journey to the pole and back\u2014which would have assisted his claim of such speed\u2014is contradicted by his companion Henson's account of tortured detours to avoid \"pressure ridges\" (ice floes' rough edges, often a few meters high) and \"leads\" (open water between those floes).\nIn his official report, Peary claimed to have traveled a total of 304 nautical miles between April 2, 1909, (when he left Bartlett's last camp) and April 9 (when he returned there), to the pole, the same distance back, and in the vicinity of the pole. These distances are counted without detours due to drift, leads and difficult ice, i.e. the distance traveled must have been significantly higher to make good the distance claimed. Peary and his party arrived back in Cape Columbia on the morning of April 23, 1909, only about two and a half days after Capt Bartlett, yet Peary claimed he had traveled a minimum of more than Bartlett (to the Pole and vicinity).\nThe conflicting and unverified claims of Cook and Peary prompted Roald Amundsen to take extensive precautions in navigation during Amundsen's South Pole expedition so as to leave no room for doubt concerning his 1911 attainment of the South Pole, which\u2014like Robert Falcon Scott's a month later in 1912\u2014was supported by the sextant, theodolite, and compass observations of several other navigators.\nReview of Peary's diary.\nThe diary that Robert E. Peary kept on his 1909 polar expedition was finally made available for research in 1986. Historian Larry Schweikart examined it, finding that: the writing was consistent throughout (giving no evidence of post-expedition alteration), there were consistent pemmican and other stains on all pages, and all evidence was consistent with a conclusion that Peary's observations were made on the spot he claimed. Schweikart compared the reports and experiences of Japanese explorer Naomi Uemura, who reached the North Pole alone in 1978, to those of Peary and found they were consistent. However, Peary made no entries in the diary on the crucial days of April 6 and 7, 1909, and his famous words \"The Pole at Last!\", allegedly written in his diary at the pole, were written on loose slips of paper that were inserted into the diary.\n1984 and 1989 National Geographic Society studies.\nIn 1984, the National Geographic Society (NGS), a major sponsor of Peary's expeditions, commissioned Wally Herbert, an Arctic explorer himself, to write an assessment of Peary's original 1909 diary and astronomical observations. As Herbert researched the material, he came to believe that Peary falsified his records and concluded that he did not reach the North Pole. His book, \"The Noose of Laurels\", caused a furor when it was published in 1989. If Peary did not reach the pole in 1909, Herbert would claim the record of being the first to reach the pole on foot.\nIn 1989, the NGS also conducted a two-dimensional photogrammetric analysis of the shadows in photographs and a review of ocean depth measures taken by Peary; its staff concluded that he was no more than away from the pole. Peary's original camera, a 1908 #4 Folding Pocket Kodak, did not survive. As such cameras were made with at least six different lenses from various manufacturers, the focal length of the lens, and hence the shadow analysis based on it, must be considered uncertain at best. The NGS has never released Peary's photos for an independent analysis. Specialists questioned the conclusions of the NGS. The NGS commissioned the Foundation for the Promotion of the Art of Navigation to resolve the issue, which concluded that Peary had indeed reached the North Pole.\nReview of depth soundings.\nSupporters of Peary and Henson assert that the depth soundings they made on the outward journey have been matched by recent surveys, and so their claim of having reached the Pole is confirmed. Since only the first few of the Peary party's soundings, taken nearest the shore, touched bottom; experts have said their usefulness is limited to showing that he was above deep water. Peary's expedition possessed 4,000 fathoms of sounding line, but he took only 2,000 with him over an ocean already established as being deeper in many regions. Peary stated in 1909 Congressional hearings about the expedition that he made no longitudinal observations during his trip, only latitude observations, yet he maintained he stayed on the \"Columbia meridian\" all along, and that his soundings were made on this meridian. The pack ice was moving all the time, so he had no way of knowing where he was without longitudinal observations.\nRe-creation of expedition in 2005.\nIn 2005, British explorer Tom Avery and four companions re-created the outward portion of Peary's journey using replica wooden sleds and Canadian Eskimo Dog teams. They ensured their sled weights were the same as Peary's sleds throughout their journey. They reached the North Pole in 36 days, 22 hours\u2014nearly five hours faster than Peary. However, Avery's fastest 5-day march was 90 nautical miles (170\u00a0km), significantly short of the 135 nautical miles (250\u00a0km) claimed by Peary.\nAfter reaching the Pole, Avery and his team were airlifted off the ice rather than returning by dogsled.\nLegacy.\nSeveral United States Navy ships have been named . The Peary\u2013MacMillan Arctic Museum at Bowdoin College is named for Peary and fellow Arctic explorer Donald Baxter MacMillan. Robert E. Peary Middle School in Gardena, CA, and Robert E. Peary High School in Rockvile, MD, were named after him. In 1986, the United States Postal Service issued a 22-cent postage stamp in honor of Peary and Henson;\nPeary Land, Peary Glacier, Peary Nunatak and Cape Peary in Greenland, Peary Bay and Peary Channel in Canada, as well as Mount Peary in Antarctica, are named in his honor. The lunar crater Peary, located at the Moon's north pole, is also named after him.\nCamp Peary in York County, Virginia is named for Admiral Peary. Originally established as a Navy Seabee training center during World War II, it was repurposed in the 1950s as a Central Intelligence Agency training facility. It is commonly called \"The Farm\".\nAdmiral Peary Vocational Technical School, located in a neighboring community very close to his birthplace of Cresson, PA, was named for him and was opened in 1972. Today the school educates over 600 students each year in numerous technical education disciplines.\nA section of U.S. Route 22 in Cambria County, Pennsylvania, is named the Admiral Peary Highway\nMajor General Adolphus Greely, leader of the ill-fated Lady Franklin Bay Expedition from 1881 to 1884, noted that no Arctic expert questioned that Peary courageously risked his life traveling hundreds of miles from land, and that he reached regions adjacent to the pole. After initial acceptance of Peary's claim, he later came to doubt Peary's having reached 90\u00b0.\nIn his book \"Ninety Degrees North\", polar historian Fergus Fleming describes Peary as \"undoubtedly the most driven, possibly the most successful and probably the most unpleasant man in the annals of polar exploration\".\nIn 1932, an expedition was made by Robert Bartlett and Marie Ahnighito Peary Stafford, Peary's daughter, on the \"Effie M. Morrissey\" to erect a monument to Peary at Cape York, Greenland.\nPopular culture.\nNeil Munro gives a satirical account of the rival claims of Peary and Cook in his Erchie Macpherson story \"Erchie Explains the Polar Situation\", first published in the \"Glasgow Evening News\" of 4 October 1909.\nE. L. Doctorow recounts Peary\u2019s expedition in his novel \"Ragtime\" (1975).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Bends are used in a variety of situations, including climbing, sailing, and securing loads. They are classified based on their ability to be tightened or released, their resistance to slipping, and their strength. Some common types include the sheet bend, the double fisherman's knot, and the double figure-eight bend. Bends allow two ropes to be securely joined together, enabling the combined ropes to support weight or transmit force. It is important to choose the appropriate bend for the specific task at hand, as some may be stronger or more secure than others.\nMisuse of reef knot as a bend.\nThe common reef knot (square knot) is sometimes mistakenly tied as a bend.

{"id": "61009", "revid": "4967956", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61009", "title": "Mellotron", "text": "Musical instrument\nThe Mellotron is an electro-mechanical musical instrument developed in Birmingham, England, in 1963. It is played by pressing its keys, each of which causes a length of magnetic tape to contact a capstan, which pulls it across a playback head. As the key is released, the tape is retracted by a spring to its initial position. Different portions of the tape can be played for different sounds.\nThe Mellotron evolved from the similar Chamberlin, but could be mass-produced more efficiently. The first models were designed for the home and contained a variety of sounds, including automatic accompaniments. Bandleader Eric Robinson and television personality David Nixon helped promote the first instruments, and celebrities such as Princess Margaret were early adopters. It was adopted by rock and pop groups in the mid to late 1960s. One of the first pop songs featuring the Mellotron was Manfred Mann's \"Semi-Detached, Suburban Mr. James\" (1966). The Beatles used it on tracks including the hit single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (1967). \nThe Moody Blues keyboardist Mike Pinder used it extensively on the band's 1967 album \"Days of Future Passed\" as well as the group's following six albums. During the 1970s, the Mellotron became common in progressive rock, used by groups such as King Crimson, Yes, and Genesis. Later models, such as the bestselling M400, dispensed with the accompaniments and some sound selection controls so it could be used by touring musicians. The instrument's popularity declined in the 1980s after the introduction of polyphonic synthesizers and samplers, despite high-profile performers such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and XTC continuing to use the instrument.\nProduction of the Mellotron ceased in 1986, but it regained popularity in the 1990s and was used by bands such as Oasis, the Smashing Pumpkins, Muse, and Radiohead. This led to the resurrection of the original manufacturer, Streetly Electronics. In 2007, Streetly produced the M4000, which combined the layout of the M400 with the bank selection of earlier models.\nOperation.\nThe Mellotron uses the same concept as a sampler, but generates its sound using analogue recordings on audio tape. When a key is pressed, a tape connected to it is pushed against a playback head, as in a tape deck. While the key remains depressed, the tape is drawn over the head, and a sound is played. When the key is released, a spring pulls the tape back to its original position.\nA variety of sounds are available on the instrument. On earlier models, the instrument is split into \"lead\" and \"rhythm\" sections. There is a choice of six \"stations\" of rhythm sounds, each containing three rhythm tracks and three fill tracks. The fill tracks can also be mixed together. Similarly, there is a choice of six lead stations, each containing three lead instruments which can be mixed. In the centre of the Mellotron, there is a tuning button that allows a variation in pitch (tempo, in the case of the rhythm tracks). Later models do not have the concept of stations and have a single knob to select a sound, along with the tuning control. However, the frame containing the tapes is designed to be removed, and replaced with one with different sounds.\nAlthough the Mellotron was designed to reproduce the sound of the original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter) and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, to the extent that the Mellotron responds to aftertouch.\nAnother factor in the Mellotron's sound is that the individual notes were recorded in isolation. For a musician accustomed to playing in an orchestral setting, this was unusual, and meant that they had nothing against which to intonate. Noted cellist Reginald Kilbey refused to downtune his cello to cover the lower range of the Mellotron, and so the bottom notes are actually performed on a double bass (His refusal was based on the fact that him playing these notes on his cello would be robbing a double bassist of the session fee. When the double bassist turned up for the next session it was found to be Kilbey with a different instrument, thereby collecting a double fee for both appearances). According to Mellotron author Nick Awde, one note of the string sounds contains the sound of a chair being scraped in the background.\nWhen the Chamberlin was first developed, the initial recorded sound used was that of three violins, thereby committing the instrument range to G3 to F6, being the range of the violin. Unfortunately, as with the cello, many other instruments did not conform to this range. The noted solo flute (which appears on the introduction to Strawberry Fields Forever) actually comprises recordings from an alto flute and a soprano flute, which accounts for some of the odd tuning that appears when chords are played. Other sounds such as the brass opted for a layered effect where instruments were recorded within their correct range. Others recorded more recently, such as the bass clarinet opt instead to drop the tuning on the lowest notes by pitching them electronically. The Mellotron choir was recorded in two halves: four men in one studio, and four women in another adjacent, thereby allowing for the actual recording of three sounds concurrently. In this, the male singers from the Ted Taylor Choir were allowed to drop the highest notes back to the previous octave as they were considerably out of their natural range.\nThe original Mellotrons were intended to be used in the home or in clubs and were not designed for touring bands. Even the later M400, which was designed to be as portable as possible, weighed over . Smoke, variations in temperature, and humidity were also detrimental to the instrument's reliability. Moving the instrument between cold storage rooms and brightly lit stages could cause the tapes to stretch and stick on the capstan. Leslie Bradley recalls receiving some Mellotrons in for a repair \"looking like a blacksmith had shaped horseshoes on top\". Pressing too many keys at once caused the motor to drag, resulting in the notes sounding flat. Robert Fripp stated that \"[t]uning a Mellotron doesn't\". Dave Kean, an expert Mellotron repairer, recommends that older Mellotrons should not be immediately used after a period of inactivity, as the tape heads can become magnetised in storage and destroy the recordings on them if played.\nHistory.\nAlthough tape samplers had been explored in research studios, the first commercially available keyboard-driven tape instruments were built and sold by California-based Harry Chamberlin. The concept of the Mellotron originated when Chamberlin's sales agent, Bill Fransen, brought two of Chamberlin's Musicmaster 600 instruments to England in 1962 to search for someone who could manufacture 70 matching tape heads for future Chamberlins. He met Frank, Norman, and Les Bradley of tape engineering company Bradmatic Ltd, who said they could improve on the original design. The Bradleys subsequently met bandleader Eric Robinson, who agreed to help finance the recording of the necessary instruments and sounds. Together with the Bradleys and television celebrity David Nixon (Robinson's son-in-law), they formed a company, Mellotronics, in order to market the instrument. Robinson was particularly enthusiastic about the Mellotron because he felt it would revitalise his career, which was then on the wane. He arranged the recording sessions at IBC Studios in London, which he co-owned with George Clouston.\nThe first model to be commercially manufactured was the Mk I in 1963. An updated version, the Mk II, was released the following year and featured the full set of sounds selectable by banks and stations. The instrument was expensive, costing \u00a31,000 (), at a time when a typical house cost \u00a32,000\u2013\u00a33,000.\nFransen failed to explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone overseas was copying his idea. After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they would both continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.\nIn 1970, the model M400 was released, which contained 35 notes (G\u2013F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. In the early 1970s, hundreds of the instruments were assembled and sold by EMI under exclusive licence. Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400\u00a0\u2013 the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially obsolete. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.\nStreetly Electronics was subsequently reactivated by Les Bradley's son John and Martin Smith. After Les Bradley's death in 1997, they decided to resume full-time operation as a support and refurbishment business. By 2007, the stock of available instruments to repair and restore was diminishing, so they decided to build a new model, which became the M4000. The instrument combined the features of several previous models, and featured the layout and chassis of an M400 but with a digital bank selector that emulated the mechanical original in the Mk II.\nNotable users.\nThe first notable musician to use the Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who was specifically hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote the use of the instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that the automatic backing tracks on the Mk II's left-hand keyboard allowed him to provide more accomplished performances than his own basic skills on the piano could provide.\nThe earlier 1960s Mk II units were made for the home and the characteristics of the instrument attracted a number of celebrities. Among the early Mellotron owners were Princess Margaret, Peter Sellers, King Hussein of Jordan and Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (whose Mellotron was installed in the Church of Scientology's head UK office at Saint Hill Manor). According to Robin Douglas-Home, Princess Margaret \"adored it; (Lord Snowdon) positively loathed it\".\nAfter Mellotronics had targeted them as a potential customer, the BBC became interested in the possibilities of the instrument, hoping it would allow them to increase throughput at the Radiophonic Workshop. Two custom-made models loaded with sound effects were acquired in 1963, but the Radiophonic Workshop were unenthusiastic and problems with fluctuating tape speed and noise meant the sound was not up to professional broadcast quality. They ended up in the BBC FX library.\nBritish multi-instrumentalist Graham Bond is considered the first rock musician to record with a Mellotron, beginning in 1965. The first hit song to feature a Mellotron Mk II was \"Baby Can It Be True\", which Bond performed live with the machine in televised performances, using solenoids to trigger the tapes from his Hammond organ. Manfred Mann then included multiple Mellotron parts on their single, \"Ha! Ha! Said the Clown\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Rquote/styles.css\"/&gt;{ class=\"rquote pullquote floatright\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"display:table; border-collapse:collapse; border-style:none; float:right; margin:0.5em 0.75em; width:33%; \"\nMike Pinder worked at Streetly Electronics for 18 months in the early 1960s as a tester, and was immediately excited by the possibilities of the instrument. After trying piano and Hammond organ, he settled on the Mellotron as the instrument of choice for his band, the Moody Blues, purchasing a second-hand model from Fort Dunlop Working Men's Club in Birmingham and using it extensively on every album from \"Days of Future Passed\" (1967) to \"Octave\" (1978). \nPinder says he introduced John Lennon and Paul McCartney to the Mellotron, and persuaded each of them to buy one. The Beatles hired a machine and used it on their single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", recorded in various takes between November and December 1966. Author Mark Cunningham describes the part in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" as \"probably the most famous Mellotron figure of all-time\". Although producer George Martin was unconvinced by the instrument, describing it \"as if a Neanderthal piano had impregnated a primitive electronic keyboard\", they continued to compose and record with various Mellotrons for the albums \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967) and \"The Beatles\" (1968, also known as \"the White Album\"). McCartney went on to use the Mellotron sporadically in his solo career.\nThe instrument became increasingly popular among rock and pop bands during the psychedelic era, adding what author Thom Holmes terms \"an eerie, unearthly sound\" to their recordings. Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones played a Mellotron on several of his band's songs over 1967\u201368. These include \"We Love You\", where he used the instrument to create a Moroccan-sounding horn section, \"She's a Rainbow\", \"2000 Light Years from Home\" and \"Jigsaw Puzzle\".\nThe Mellotron became a key instrument in progressive rock. King Crimson bought two Mellotrons when forming in 1969. They were aware of Pinder's contributions to the Moody Blues and did not want to sound similar, but concluded there was no other way of generating the orchestral sound. The instrument was originally played by Ian McDonald, and subsequently by Robert Fripp upon McDonald's departure. Later member David Cross recalled he did not particularly want to play the Mellotron, but felt that it was simply what he needed to do as a member of the band. \nTony Banks bought a Mellotron from Fripp in 1971, which he claimed was previously used by King Crimson, to use with Genesis. He decided to not to use the instrument as though it were an orchestra, instead using block chords. He went on to explain that he used it in the same manner as a synth pad on later albums. His unaccompanied introduction to \"Watcher of the Skies\" on the album \"Foxtrot\" (1972), played on a Mk II with combined strings and brass, became significant enough that Streetly Electronics provided a \"Watcher Mix\" sound with the M4000. Banks claims to still have a Mellotron in storage, but does not feel inclined to use it as he generally prefers to use up-to-date technology. Barclay James Harvest's Woolly Wolstenholme bought an M300 primarily to use for string sounds, and continued to play an M400 live into the 2000s as part of a reformed band.\nRick Wakeman played Mellotron on David Bowie's 1969 hit song \"Space Oddity\". Having previously found it difficult to keep in tune, Wakeman had discovered a way to do so using a special fingering technique.\nThe Mellotron was used extensively by German electronic band Tangerine Dream through the 1970s, on albums such as \"Atem\" (1973), \"Phaedra\" (1974), \"Rubycon\" (1975), \"Stratosfear\" (1976), and \"Encore\" (1977). In the late 1970s, French duo Space Art used a Mellotron during the recording of their second album, \"Trip in the Centre Head\". In 1983, the band's Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics if they could produce a digital model, as the group migrated towards using samplers.\nAlthough the Mellotron was not extensively used in the 1980s, a number of bands featured it as a prominent instrument. One of the few UK post-punk bands to do so was Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark, who featured it heavily on their platinum-selling 1981 album \"Architecture &amp; Morality\". Andy McCluskey has stated they used the Mellotron because they were starting to run into the limitations of the cheap monophonic synthesizers they had used up to that point. He bought a second-hand M400 and was immediately impressed with the strings and choir sounds. XTC's Dave Gregory recalls seeing bands using Mellotrons when growing up in the 1970s, and thought it would be an interesting addition to the group's sound. He bought a second-hand model in 1982 for \u00a3165, and first used it on the album \"Mummer\" (1983). IQ's Martin Orford bought a second-hand M400 and used it primarily for visual appeal rather than musical quality or convenience.\nThe Mellotron resurfaced in 1995 on Oasis' album \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" The instrument was played by both Noel Gallagher and Paul Arthurs on several tracks, but a particularly prominent use was the cello sound on the hit single \"Wonderwall\", played by Arthurs. It also notably appears on their 2000 single \"Go Let It Out\". Radiohead asked Streetly Electronics to restore and repair a model for them in 1997, and recorded with it on several tracks for their album \"OK Computer\" (1997). The French electronic duo Air extensively used a M400 on their two first albums \"Moon Safari\" in 1998 and \"The Virgin Suicides\" in 1999.\nSpock's Beard's Ryo Okumoto is a fan of the Mellotron, saying it characterises the sound of the band. Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson has acquired one of King Crimson's old Mellotrons and, in 2013, gave a demonstration of the instrument in celebration of its 50th anniversary.\nCompetitors.\nAlternatives to the Mellotron were manufactured by competitors in the early to late 1970s. The Mattel Optigan was a toy keyboard designed to be used in the home, which played back sounds using optical discs. This was followed by the Vako Orchestron in 1975, which used a more professional-sounding version of the same technology. It was used by Patrick Moraz. The Birotron was a similar concept based around 8-track cartridges, used by Wakeman.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61012", "revid": "3542054", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61012", "title": "Display PostScript", "text": "2D graphics engine\nDisplay PostScript (or DPS) is a 2D graphics engine system for computers that uses the PostScript (PS) imaging model and language to generate on-screen graphics. PS was originally developed for computer printing, to which DPS adds a number of features intended to ease working with bitmapped displays and improve performance of some common tasks.\nEarly versions of PostScript display systems were developed at Adobe Systems. During development of the NeXT computers, NeXT and Adobe collaborated to produce the official DPS system, which was released in 1987. NeXT used DPS throughout its history, while versions from Adobe were popular on Unix workstations for a time during the 1980s and 1990s.\nDesign.\nThe original PostScript was written for printing, with the model being that only one document could be printed at one time, and that the document was broken into logical sections approximating a page. For this reason, the underlying model of PS was based on a stack machine similar to the Forth programming language, which reduced the complexity of the code on the printer and the amount of memory needed to store individual graphics. The system would gather up instructions until the command was issued, at which time all the instructions received since the last or the start of the session were performed and the memory used by those instructions could then be released.\nIn contrast, a display engine works in a very different environment. There is no analog of a that will eventually allow queued instructions to be performed, generally any drawing is expected to take place immediately. Moreover, whereas a PS printer could only print one document at a time, in a modern computer with multiple display windows, all of the windows could be updating at the same times using different settings. This was addressed with the introduction of \"multiple execution contexts\", each of which approximated the model seen on a printer; that is, each window effectively had its own PS context and instruction stack, and each window could then produce output with different settings, like whether or not the next line should be dashed or solid. The DPS system provided library calls to create the contexts, which could be completely independent or shared. Shared contexts were useful in windowing systems because they allowed all of the windows within an application, or even across multiple applications, to share settings and especially pre-defined procedures stored in the and . One particularly important use of the shared was to store system-wide fonts.\nThe font system itself also had to be modified. PS has a powerful system that produces high-quality fonts from outline descriptions including \"hints\" which improve quality at smaller sizes. These all rely on the output resolution being fairly high, typically 300\u00a0dpi and up. For much lower-resolution monitors (typically 72\u00a0dpi at the time), the results wouldn't have been good. DPS added a system to allow hand-drawn bitmaps to be cached in the dictionaries, which was used to provide fonts that could be bit blitted directly to the display. After the widespread use of 32-bit color displays the need for this sort of solution has been reduced, as anti-aliasing solves many of these issues. Likewise, DPS added halftone phase support to ensure newly drawn objects had the same halftone as earlier objects, but this too has been reduced in importance on modern systems.\nPS stored objects and code within the dictionaries using string identifiers. This made finding the definition expensive as the size of the collections grew, which was a side-effect of many of these new features. DPS addressed this by adding the ability to store objects in the dictionary using integers instead of strings. This \"encoded system names\" concept could greatly improve performance of various tasks like finding a system font or looking up a common routine like \"draw title bar\". These encoded names were stored on a per-context basis.\nOther changes addressed the need for direct interactivity. This included the ability to perform \"incremental updates\" so that PS commands that produced output could be performed immediately. There were also systems for performing hit detection, so that one could see if a particular location hit any of the drawn objects. This was used, for instance, to test which objects in the view were being hit at the location of a mouse click.\nFinally, DPS added the concept of a , a C-language function that took DPS commands in the form of strings and sent them to the DPS context to be output. This allowed, for instance, one to write a C-language function that produced a rectangle on the screen.\nDPS did not, however, add a windowing system. That was left to the implementation to provide, and DPS was meant to be used in conjunction with an existing windowing engine. This was often the X Window System, and in this form Display PostScript was later adopted by companies such as IBM and SGI for their workstations. Often the code needed to get from an X window to a DPS context was much more complicated than the entire rest of the DPS interface. This greatly limited the popularity of DPS when any alternative was available.\nHistory.\nNeXT in September 1987 became the first company to license Display Postscript. The developers of NeXT wrote a completely new windowing engine to take full advantage of NeXT's object-oriented operating system. A number of commands were added to DPS to create the windows and to react to events, similar to but simpler than NeWS. The single API made programming at higher levels much easier and made NeXT one of the few systems to extensively use DPS. The user-space windowing system library NeXTSTEP used PostScript to draw items like titlebars and scrollers. This, in turn, made extensive use of codice_1s, which were in turn wrapped in objects and presented to the programmer in object form.\nDigital Equipment Corporation in early 1988 licensed Display PostScript for DECwindows. Adobe said that it hoped that IBM and Microsoft, for OS/2 Presentation Manager, and Apple Computer would also use the technology.\nIn November 1993 Sun Microsystems shipped OpenWindows 3.3, which dropped the support for NeWS and its non-standard extensions to PostScript, replacing it with DPS.\nModern derivatives.\nAfter acquiring NeXT, Apple's Mac OS X operating system uses a central window server (created entirely by Apple) that caches window graphics as bitmaps, instead of storing and executing PostScript code. A graphics library called Quartz 2D provides PostScript-style imaging using the PDF rendering model (a subset, plus tweaks, of the PostScript model), but this is used by application frameworks\u2014there is no PostScript present in the Mac OS X window server. Apple chose to use this model for a variety of reasons, including the avoidance of licensing fees for DPS and more efficient support of legacy Carbon and Classic code; QuickDraw-based applications use bitmapped drawing exclusively.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded in 1981 by Matthew Carter, Mike Parker, Cherie Cone, and Rob Friedman, all former employees of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. It was located in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The font business, including MyFonts, was acquired by Monotype Imaging in March 2012. The remainder of the business, responsible for Pageflex and Bolt Browser, was spun off to a new entity named Marlborough Software Development Holdings Inc. It was later renamed Pageflex, Inc following a successful management buyout in December 2013.\nProducts.\nBitstream created a library of \"classic\" fonts (usually under different names for trademark reasons) in digital form. For example, Times Ten was released as \"Dutch 801\", Akzidenz-Grotesk as \"Gothic 725\", Aurora is \"News 706\", Antique Olive as \"Incised 901\", Bembo as \"Aldine 401\", Berthold Block as \"Gothic 821\", Bodoni Campanile as \"Modern 735\", Choc as \"Staccato 555\", Codex as \"Calligraphic 421\", Cochin is \"Engravers' Oldstyle 205\", Coronet is \"Ribbon 131\", Eurostile as \"Square 721\", Frutiger as \"Humanist 777\", Gill Sans as \"Humanist 521\", Kabel as \"Geometric 231\", Memphis as \"GeoSlab 703\", Metro as \"Geometric 415\", Mistral is \"Staccato 222\", Melior is \"Zapf Elliptical\", Optima as \"Zapf Humanist\", Oscar as \"Formal 436\", Old English Text is \"Cloister Black\", Peignot as \"Exotic 350\", Perpetua is \"Lapidary 333\", Plantin as \"Aldine 721\", Profil as \"Decorated 035\", Palatino as \"Zapf Calligraphic\", Rockwell is \"Geometric Slabserif 712\", Syntax as \"Humanist 531\", Torino as \"Industrial 736\" and Univers as \"Zurich\". The Bitstream font collection is most widely used through its inclusion with the CorelDRAW software, as well as other Corel products such as WordPerfect Office.\nThe company received extensive criticism for its strategy of cheaply offering digitisations of pre-existing typefaces that it had not designed. While technically not illegal, font designer John Hudson would describe its selling of large numbers of typefaces on CD at discount prices as \"one of the worst instances of piracy in the history of type\".\nBitstream developed a number of fonts on its own, such as Amerigo, by Gerard Unger Charter, by Matthew Carter, Carmina by Gudrun Zapf, Chianti by Dennis Pasternak, Iowan Old Style by John Downer, Arrus by Richard Lipton and the freeware Bitstream Vera family of fonts.\nOne of their best known fonts is Swiss 721 BT, which is a Helvetica clone with condensed versions and a rounded version. It was among the first digitally available Swiss family typefaces, being designed for that purpose in 1982.\nAnother Bitstream product is Font Fusion, a font rasterizing engine developed jointly with Type Solutions, Inc., which was later owned entirely by Bitstream.\nThe multi-byte character set was named Bitstream International Character Set (BICS).\nHistory.\nThe company had a high level of involvement in BeOS, with older BeOS releases using a Bitstream renderer, and the latest development releases from 2001 using Font Fusion. The OS, including its freeware releases, included a large number of Bitstream fonts, including their clones of Times New Roman, Helvetica and Courier.\nOn December 2, 1998, Bitstream Inc. announced acquisition of all outstanding stock of Type Solutions, Inc. In addition, Sampo Kaasila, its founder and president and the creator of TrueType, agreed to join Bitstream's team as Director of Research and Development.\nIn January 1999, Bitstream launched MyFonts, an open marketplace offering fonts from various foundries and a forum where users could interact with type experts.\nIn January 2009, Bitstream introduced the BOLT Browser, a Java ME-based Web browser for mobile phones. It was distributed free of charge to consumers and was built using the company's ThunderHawk mobile Web browsing technology for mobile network operators and handset manufacturers. The product was discontinued by the end of 2011.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61020", "revid": "29539620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61020", "title": "Dave Mustaine", "text": "American musician (born 1961)\nDavid Scott Mustaine (born September 13, 1961) is an American musician. He is the co-founder, frontman, primary songwriter and sole consistent member of the thrash metal band Megadeth and was the lead guitarist of Metallica from 1981 to 1983. Megadeth has released sixteen studio albums, sold over 50 million records worldwide, with six albums platinum-certified, and won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2017 at the 59th Grammy Awards, for the title track of their fifteenth studio album, \"Dystopia\".\nPrior to forming Megadeth, Mustaine was the lead guitarist of Metallica but did not appear on any albums. He was, however, credited as a writer on four songs from \"Kill 'Em All\" and two songs from \"Ride the Lightning\". Mustaine was born into a family of Jehovah's Witnesses. He now identifies as a born-again Christian. He has experienced alcohol and drug problems throughout his life, and briefly battled throat cancer in 2019. Mustaine has been married to Pamela Anne Casselberry since 1991, with whom he has two children, Electra and Justis Mustaine.\nIn a vote on the internet forum of \"Ultimate Guitar\", Mustaine was ranked third in the top 25 rhythm guitarists of all time, first in Joel McIver's book \"The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists\", tenth in \"Loudwire's\" \"66 Best Hard Rock + Metal Guitarists of All Time\", and third in their \"10 Greatest Rhythm Guitarists in Rock + Metal\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEarly life.\nMustaine was born on September 13, 1961, in La Mesa, California, (a nearby suburb of San Diego) to parents Emily Marie (\"n\u00e9e\" David) and John Jefferson Mustaine. His father was of French, German, Irish, and Finnish descent, while his mother was of German Jewish ancestry. The Mustaine family were Jehovah's Witnesses.\nMustaine had three older sisters, Michelle, Suzanne, and Debbie, who were 18, 15, and 3 respectively when he was born. Due to the significant age difference between Mustaine and his sisters, as a child he often thought of them as his aunts rather than sisters. Mustaine has described family life as tumultuous during his early life, lamenting years later that \"life unraveled in a great many ways\" for his family before he was born. Mustaine has described his father as \"a very smart and successful man, good with his hands and head\" who was a branch manager for Bank of America before moving to NCR, where the corporation's transition from mechanical to electrical technology ultimately made him expendable and cost him his job. A longtime problem drinker, John Mustaine's issues with alcohol only grew worse from then on, and he left his four-year-old son permanently after Emily divorced him in 1965.\nEarly career.\nPanic.\nPanic was Mustaine's first band. The initial lineup was Dave Harmon on drums, Tom Quecke on guitar, Bob Evans on bass and Pat Voelkes as the singer, with Mustaine on lead guitar. The first gig, played at Dana Point, featured Mike Leftwych as a substitute drummer. Leftwych and a sound man were killed in a car crash after the show. Mustaine stated that after the band started to fall apart in 1981, Quecke was also killed in a separate car crash shortly after.\nThe first song that Mustaine ever wrote was Jump in the Fire. Panic songs that Mustaine went on to reuse for Megadeth include N2RHQ (renamed Hangar 18), Child Saint (renamed Rust in Peace... Polaris) and Mechanix. Cover songs that Panic played included Nature's Child by Triumph and This Planet's on Fire (Burn in Hell) by Sammy Hagar.\nMetallica.\nIn 1981, Mustaine disbanded Panic and joined Metallica as the lead guitarist. Metallica's drummer Lars Ulrich had posted an ad in a local newspaper, \"The Recycler\", looking for a lead guitarist. Mustaine later said of his first meeting with James Hetfield and Ulrich: \"I was in the room warming up and I walked out and asked, 'Well, am I gonna audition or what?', and they said, 'No, you've got the job.' I couldn't believe how easy it had been and suggested that we get some beer to celebrate.\"\nMetallica began recording their first album titled \"Kill 'Em All\" in 1983 but Mustaine's tenure with Metallica was short-lived. Brian Slagel, owner of Metal Blade Records, recalled in an interview: \"Dave was an incredibly talented guy but he also had an incredibly large problem with alcohol and drugs. He'd get wasted and become a real crazy person, a raging megalomaniac, and the other guys just couldn't deal with that after a while. I mean, they all drank of course, but Dave drank more\u2026 much more. I could see they were beginning to get fed up of seeing Dave drunk out of his mind all the time.\"\nOn one occasion, Mustaine brought his dog to rehearsal; the dog jumped onto Metallica bassist Ron McGovney's car and scratched the paint. Hetfield allegedly yelled at Mustaine's dog and kicked it in a fit of rage, which provoked Mustaine into physically attacking Hetfield. Mustaine was fired following the altercation, but the next day, Mustaine asked to be allowed back in the band and was granted his request. Another incident occurred when Mustaine, who had been drinking, poured a can of beer down the neck and into the pickups of McGovney's bass, resulting in electrical damage. McGovney claimed that he was unaware of the damage and that he received an electric shock upon plugging it into an amplifier.\nOn April 11, 1983, after Metallica had driven to New York to record their debut album, Mustaine was officially ejected from the band because of his alcoholism, drug abuse, overly aggressive behavior, and personal clashes with founding members Hetfield and Ulrich, an incident Mustaine refers to as \"no warning, no second chance\". The band packed up Mustaine's gear, drove him to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and put him on a Greyhound bus bound for Los Angeles. On this bus ride Mustaine scribbled some lyrical ideas on the back of a hand bill, which later became the song \"Set the World Afire\" from the 1988 Megadeth album \"So Far, So Good... So What!\"\nDuring his time in Metallica, Mustaine toured with the band, co-wrote four songs that appeared on \"Kill 'Em All,\" and co-wrote two songs that eventually appeared on the 1984 album \"Ride the Lightning\". Mustaine has also made unverified claims to have written parts of \"Leper Messiah\" from \"Master of Puppets\".\nFallen Angels.\nFallen Angels was a short-lived band that Mustaine founded after his departure from Metallica. In April 1983, after returning to California to live with his mother, he landed what he calls his first real job with the aid of Robbie McKinney. McKinney and a friend, Matt Kisselstein, worked with Mustaine as telemarketers. Mustaine quit his job after earning enough money to move to an apartment in Hollywood, and recruited McKinney, who played guitar, and Kisselstein, who played bass, for his band Fallen Angels. In his biography, Mustaine describes that \"We lacked the chemistry, the energy, the spark\u2014or whatever you want to call it\u2014that gives a band life in its infancy.\" The partnership did not last.\nThis paved the way for his partnership with Dave Ellefson and Greg Handevidt. Ellefson was playing the opening bass line of Van Halen's \"Runnin' with the Devil\" in the apartment below Mustaine's. After stomping on the floor and shouting for them to stop, Mustaine, being hung over at the time, took a potted plant and threw it out of his window and hit the air conditioner of the apartment below. This resulted in the two coming up to Mustaine's apartment to ask for cigarettes. Mustaine replied \"There's a store on the corner\" and slammed the door in their faces. A few minutes later, they knocked on the door, this time asking if they could buy him beer. Mustaine's reply: 'OK, now you are talking'. They spent the night talking about music, and soon after, Mustaine, Ellefson and Handevidt were bandmates.\nWith little confidence in his own vocal capabilities, Mustaine added 'Lor' Kane to the Fallen Angels roster. Kane did not stay long, although he is credited for the suggestion that they should change the name to Megadeth, knowing that Mustaine had written a song of the same name. After Kane left, the first of many drummers, Dijon Carruthers, joined the band. The lineup of Mustaine, Ellefson, Handevidt, and Carruthers was one of the first incarnations of Megadeth.\nMegadeth.\n1980s.\nInitial drummer Carruthers was replaced after Mustaine and Ellefson decided they could not trust him. Carruthers had chosen to hide his black heritage from them by claiming he was Spanish, and they could not understand why he would deceive them. Brett Frederickson joined the band in November 1983 as their next drummer. \nAfter playing with other singers, including John Cyriis (who joined at Carruthers insistence, following his own rejoining of the band) and Billy Bonds, Mustaine took on vocal duties himself at a Megadeth rehearsal on New Years Eve 1984, in addition to playing lead and rhythm guitar. \nKerry King joined the band for a few shows (including the band's debut gig) in February and April 1984; however, he opted to leave Megadeth so he could continue working on his own band, Slayer.\nThat year, Megadeth produced a three-song demo with drummer Lee Rauch. Rauch left after Mustaine convinced him to play with a broken foot.\nJazz-influenced drummer Gar Samuelson joined the band. Megadeth recorded a demo as a three-piece band, which captured the attention of guitarist Chris Poland, also a jazz player and a friend of Samuelson, who subsequently joined the band. In November, the band signed a deal with Combat Records and began touring.\nIn June 1985, Megadeth released their first album, \"Killing Is My Business... and Business Is Good!\", via Combat Records. That summer, the band toured the U.S. and Canada with Exciter. Guitarist Mike Albert replaced Chris Poland when he was incarcerated for possession of heroin. After Poland was released, he rejoined the band in October and the band then began recording their second studio album for Combat. On New Year's Eve of that year, Megadeth played in San Francisco with Exodus and Metal Church. Metallica was the headliner. This was the only time Megadeth and Metallica were on the same card, until 1993.\nIn 1986, a year after releasing their debut album, Mustaine approached Jackson Guitars for a custom-built guitar. Jackson modified their existing Jackson King V model for Mustaine by adding two more frets to the standard 22 fret King V. In the 1990s, the company began mass-producing a Dave Mustaine signature series Jackson King V, which continued into the early 2000s.\nThe following year, major label Capitol Records signed Megadeth and obtained the rights to their second studio album, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" Megadeth opened a U.S. tour with King Diamond and Mot\u00f6rhead. \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\", released on September 19, 1986, is often regarded as a thrash metal classic, producing the notable title track (the opening bass lick of which was used by MTV News segments) as well as the thrash anthem \"Wake Up Dead\".\nIn February 1987, Megadeth opened for Alice Cooper on his \"Constrictor\" tour. The band also toured with King Diamond, whose previous band, Mercyful Fate, was a huge influence on Megadeth. In March, Megadeth's first world tour began in the U.K. Mustaine and Ellefson guested on the band Malice's \"License to Kill\" album. Megadeth re-recorded \"These Boots\" for the soundtrack to the film \"Dudes\", and that summer went on tour with Overkill and Necros. Amid drug problems and suspicions of stealing the band's equipment and pawning it for drug money, Mustaine fired Poland and Samuelson after their last show in Hawaii.\nChuck Behler, who had been Samuelson's drum tech, became Megadeth's new drummer with guitarist Jeff Young replacing Poland. Megadeth released their third studio album, \"So Far, So Good... So What!\", in January 1988. The album contains the song \"In My Darkest Hour\", which, according to the liner notes of \"So Far, So Good... So What!\", was composed after the death of Metallica's bass player Cliff Burton. \"Hook in Mouth\" attacked the Parents Music Resource Center with gusto, although their cover of the Sex Pistols' \"Anarchy in the UK\", despite a guest appearance from ex-Pistol Steve Jones, was ill-advised in the eyes of \"Allmusic's\" critic.\nLater that year, Megadeth opened for Dio and then Iron Maiden on tour before playing the Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington in the U.K. with Kiss, Iron Maiden, Guns N' Roses, David Lee Roth, and Helloween. Shortly after, Mustaine fired Behler and Young, accusing Young of having thoughts of a relationship with Mustaine's then-girlfriend. Around this period, Mustaine produced the debut album from Seattle thrash band Sanctuary, called \"Refuge Denied.\"\nNick Menza, who was Chuck Behler's drum tech, joined Megadeth in 1989, and the band recorded their only track ever as a three-piece: a cover of Alice Cooper's \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\" for the horror film \"Shocker.\" Film director Penelope Spheeris would later recount in the Megadeth episode of \"Behind the Music\" that Mustaine showed up to the video shoot so fried on heroin and other drugs that he could not sing and play guitar at the same time; therefore, the singing and playing had to be recorded separately. Mustaine was arrested for \"impaired driving\" that March with seven or more drugs in his system and was forced by authorities to enter a rehabilitation program (the first of his 15 visits to rehabilitation centers).\n1990s.\nFollowing Cacophony's disbanding in 1989, Marty Friedman was auditioned the same year to fill in the vacant lead-guitar position, and joined the band in February 1990. In September of that year, the band joined the \"Clash of the Titans\" tour overseas with Slayer, Suicidal Tendencies, and Testament. The tour began one month before Megadeth released \"Rust in Peace\" (1990), which was cited as one of the best thrash metal records of all time by publications such as \"Decibel\" and \"Kerrang!\" and continued their commercial success. They then went back on the road to promote the new album, this time as support for Judas Priest.\nMegadeth started off 1991 by performing for an audience of 145,000 people at Rock in Rio before starting their own world tour with Alice in Chains as their special guest. Mustaine was married in April, the same month the \"Rusted Pieces\" home video was released. That summer, the Clash of the Titans tour hit the U.S., featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains taking the opening slot. Later that year, the Megadeth song \"Go to Hell\" was featured on the soundtrack to \"Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey\".\nAlso in 1991, Mustaine collaborated with Sean Harris from Diamond Head on the track \"Crown of Worms\". Mustaine would later appear on Diamond Head's reformation album \"Death and Progress\". Mustaine's wife, Pamela, gave birth to their son Justis in 1992. July of that year saw the release of Megadeth's most commercially successful record: \"Countdown to Extinction\", which debuted at No. 2 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and boasted some of the band's most commercially successful songs, including \"Symphony of Destruction\", \"Sweating Bullets\" and \"Skin o' My Teeth\". The original version of the \"Symphony of Destruction\" video was edited due to its depiction of a political leader being assassinated; \"Skin o' My Teeth\" was aired on MTV with a disclaimer from Mustaine insisting that the song did not endorse suicide. Ellefson contributed lyrics to the family-farm ballad \"Foreclosure of a Dream\", and Menza wrote the lyrics about canned hunting for the title track.\nPantera and Suicidal Tendencies opened for Megadeth on the \"Countdown to Extinction\" tour, and MTV News also invited Mustaine to cover the Democratic National Convention for them that summer. In November, the \"Exposure of a Dream\" home video was released. In 1993, Mustaine guested on a new album by one of the bands who had influenced his own sound: Diamond Head, and also began a U.S. tour with Stone Temple Pilots as their opening act. The tour with Stone Temple Pilots which included a planned appearance at Budokan, was ultimately canceled due to Mustaine's continuing struggles with addiction. In June, Megadeth played Milton Keynes Bowl with Diamond Head and Metallica and later opened for Metallica on a handful of European Stadium dates. Megadeth was kicked off Aerosmith's U.S. tour after just seven dates because a comment made by Mustaine (\"We don't have much time to play because Aerosmith don't have much time left to live\") was deemed extraordinarily offensive to Aerosmith. \"Angry Again\" was featured on the soundtrack to the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie \"Last Action Hero\", while \"99 Ways To Die\" was featured on \"The Beavis and Butt-Head Experience\" compilation album.\nMegadeth spent the majority of 1994 making \"Youthanasia,\" a more commercial album that had high expectations due to the success of \"Countdown to Extinction\". The band covered Black Sabbath's song \"Paranoid\" for \"Nativity in Black: A Tribute to Black Sabbath\" and performed on MTV's \"Night of the Living Megadeth\" in celebration of the Halloween release of their new album. The release of Youthanasia was also followed by a brief South American tour to promote the album.\nAnother soundtrack appearance, \"Diadems\" on \"\", kicked off 1995. Megadeth spent the first two months of the year on the \"Youthanasia\" tour with Corrosion of Conformity in tow. In March, the \"Hidden Treasures\" compilation hit European stores. The \"Evolver: The Making of Youthanasia\" home video followed in May, and \"Hidden Treasures\" made it to the U.S. and Japan in July, just in time for the start of the \"Reckoning Day\" tour with special guests Flotsam and Jetsam, Korn and Fear Factory. In September the band performed at the \"Monsters of Rock\" festival in South America, Peru.\nA Grammy nomination for \"Paranoid\" began 1996 for Megadeth. Enlisting Fear singer Lee Ving, Mustaine released the album \"The Craving\" under the moniker \"MD.45\" with Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and Goldfinger bassist Kelly LeMieux. In September, Megadeth returned to the studio, this time in Nashville, Tennessee, to record \"Cryptic Writings\".\n\"Cryptic Writings\" (1997) included thrashing songs like \"Vortex\" and \"FFF\", which were reminiscent of Megadeth's older material, alongside radio-friendly fare like \"Trust\", which reached the 5th spot on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock charts. In June, Misfits opened for the band on tour. Chaos Comics released \"The Cryptic Writings of Megadeth\" comic books in August, and a remix of \"Almost Honest\" showed up on the \"Mortal Kombat Annihilation\" soundtrack.\nMustaine's daughter, Electra Mustaine, was born on January 28, 1998, the same month that \"Trust\" was nominated for a Grammy. Megadeth played on the Howard Stern Show and that summer took part in Ozzfest. Two days after Nick Menza had undergone surgery for a benign knee tumor, he received a call from Mustaine informing him that his services would no longer be needed. Jimmy DeGrasso, who Mustaine had played with previously in MD.45, fulfilled Menza's duties. On New Year's Eve, Megadeth opened for Black Sabbath at Chase Field alongside Soulfly, Slayer, and Pantera.\nWhile touring after \"Cryptic Writings,\" Mustaine told interviewers that songs like \"She-Wolf\" and \"Vortex\" had reinvigorated his love for classic music by bands like Iron Maiden and Mot\u00f6rhead, and that he intended to write an album that was \"1/2 Peace Sells, 1/2 Cryptic Writings\"; however, after hearing about a comment that Lars Ulrich had made in the press in which he said he wished Mustaine would take more \"risks\", intentions changed. Managers and producers had more input. The song \"Crush 'Em\" was written with the express purpose of being played in wrestling arenas. In later years, Mustaine would blame much of this period on Friedman's desire to go in a more \"pop\" direction. Recorded with producer Dann Huff, again in Nashville, \"Risk\" was released on August 31, 1999. \"Crush 'Em\" made it onto the \"Universal Soldier: The Return\" soundtrack and into WCW wrestling events (notably played live on Monday Nitro). In July, the band covered \"Never Say Die\" for a second Black Sabbath tribute. They closed the Woodstock '99 music festival and again opened for Iron Maiden in Europe. The year ended with Marty Friedman announcing his departure from the band.\n2000s.\nAs the tour behind \"Risk\" soldiered on, Al Pitrelli replaced Friedman on the road. In April, the new lineup entered the studio to begin work on a new album a couple of months before they officially parted ways with Capitol Records. The summer was spent on the road with Anthrax and M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. Capitol released a compilation album in the fall, \"\", featuring two brand new (and more metal-leaning) songs, \"Dread and the Fugitive Mind\" was one of the brand new songs and appeared on the next studio album the following year. With a new deal in place with Sanctuary Records, Megadeth returned to the studio toward the end of the year to finish their album and on New Year's Eve, played a show in Anchorage, Alaska.\nAn acoustic tour sponsored by radio stations, a press tour, and a video shoot for the song \"Moto Psycho\" all preceded the May 2001 release of \"The World Needs A Hero.\" The summer was filled with festival appearances supporting AC/DC. In September, Megadeth set out across North America with Endo and Iced Earth. VH1's \"Behind the Music\" special on Megadeth aired that year and was later released on DVD. At the end of the year, the band filmed two shows in Arizona, which were released as the 2CD and DVD \"Rude Awakening.\" The early part of 2002 saw the release of a remixed and re-mastered \"Killing Is My Business...\" with bonus tracks and expanded packaging, followed by \"Rude Awakening\".\nIn January 2002, Mustaine was admitted to the hospital to have a kidney stone removed. While undergoing treatment, he was administered pain medication that triggered a relapse. Following his hospital stay, he immediately checked himself into a treatment center in Texas. While at rehab, Mustaine suffered an injury causing severe nerve damage to his left arm. The injury, induced by falling asleep with his left arm over the back of a chair caused compression of the radial nerve. He was diagnosed with radial neuropathy, also known as Saturday Night Palsy, which left him unable to grasp or even make a fist with his left hand.\nOn April 3, 2002, Mustaine announced in a press release that he was disbanding Megadeth due to his arm injury. For the next four months, Mustaine underwent intense physical therapy five days a week. Slowly, Mustaine began to play again, but was forced to \"re-teach\" his left hand.\nMustaine himself gave what he called \"the Reader's Digest version\" of the whole matter during an interview for SuicideGirls: \"I went into retirement because my arm got hurt really bad. I broke up the band which at the time was Al Pitrelli, Dave Ellefson, Jimmy DeGrasso, and myself. I was having problems with Al because he liked to drink, and we didn't want to show up at places with him drunk. Al also got married to a nice woman, but he wanted to spend time with her. After a few years, most married men are willing to die, so I figured if we got a couple years into the marriage that might have changed. But the fact was, Al wasn't fitting. DeGrasso was really hard to be around because he was so negative all the time with his complaining about money and wanting things. Ellefson was all about 'play my songs, play my songs.' I hated being around these guys so when the arm injury happened, it was a welcome relief and an indication that I had to stop.\" Mustaine went through physical therapy for his arm injury. During his recovery, he explored other areas of the music industry, including production. Contrary to what doctors had predicted, within a short time he fully recovered. However, all was mostly quiet on the Megadeth front for the better part of 2003. Mustaine left Jackson guitars, did a solo acoustic performance at a benefit show, unveiled his new ESP model at the NAMM convention, and oversaw the release of \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" as an audio DVD presented in Dolby 5.1 surround sound.\nAt the same time, Mustaine's personal life once again underwent changes. It was during this period that Mustaine became a Christian. He expressed his intent to withdraw from a show in Greece that had Rotting Christ and Dissection opening for Megadeth. Mustaine told \"The Daily Times\" during a recent interview, his own world was already shattered, and becoming a Christian was the one way he's found to put the pieces back together. \"I went back to being a Jehovah's Witness, but I wasn't happy with that.\" He later said in an interview, \"Looking up at the cross, I said six simple words, 'What have I got to lose?' Afterwards my whole life has changed. It's been hard, but I wouldn't change it for anything. Rather go my whole life believing that there is a God and find out there isn't than live my whole life thinking there isn't a God and then find out, when I die, that there is.\" Mustaine also considers his talent a gift from God. \"To be the No. 1 rated guitar player in the world is a gift from God and I'm stoked about it, but I think Chris is better than I am, anyway,\" he said. \"Either way, I don't put too much earthly merit on it.\"\nIn 2004 Mustaine oversaw the remixing and re-mastering of Megadeth's entire Capitol Records catalog. All albums were re-released with bonus tracks and full liner notes. With one album remaining in his contract to Sanctuary Records, Mustaine began recording what he intended to be his first solo album with drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and bassist Jimmy Sloas. Complete with guest solos from old friend Chris Poland, this project became a new Megadeth album, \"The System Has Failed,\" released on September 14, 2004. One month before, Mustaine announced a new touring lineup for Megadeth: Glen Drover (King Diamond/Eidolon) and James MacDonough (Iced Earth). Nick Menza had briefly been a part of the new band before differences once again caused his departure. One week before a new US tour with Exodus supporting, new drummer (and Glen's brother) Shawn Drover (Eidolon) joined Megadeth.\nThe \"Blackmail The Universe\" tour started in February 2005 with Diamond Head and Dungeon supporting. Capitol released a new greatest hits, \",\" in June, a month before Mustaine created \"Gigantour\" with Dream Theater, Anthrax, Fear Factory, Symphony X, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Life of Agony, and more. During 2005 Gigantour Mustaine brought a \"spiritual counselor\" to help him avoid the problems that almost cost him his life due to his prior drug addictions. The Dillinger Escape Plan frontman Greg Puciato stated: \"He had a pastor walking around with him on tour and riding on his bus, I think to help keep him on the straight and narrow path.\"\n\"Arsenal of Megadeth\", a two-disc anthology DVD, was released on March 21, 2006. Bass player James LoMenzo (Black Label Society, White Lion) replaced James MacDonough in February shortly before the band headed to the Dubai Desert Rock Festival in the United Arab Emirates. On April 19, the band began recording a new album, \"United Abominations,\" at SARM studios in the UK (David Gilmour's house), they announced a worldwide deal with Roadrunner Records in May 2006. \"United Abominations\" was released worldwide on May 15, 2007. However, the album had already been leaked before its release. On January 13, 2008, Dave Mustaine confirmed that guitarist Glen Drover had quit Megadeth to focus on his family and that he had been replaced by Chris Broderick of Jag Panzer. The new lineup made its live debut in Finland on February 4 and returned to the US for Gigantour 2008 in the spring. The band's twelfth studio album, \"Endgame\", was released on September 15, 2009.\nMustaine planned to open Megadeth's California recording studio to under-privileged children to teach them about rock 'n' roll. The band owns a building in San Diego, California, which has housed their recording equipment over the years. In an interview with \"Kerrang!\", Mustaine wanted to make better use of the studio by turning the space into a learning center for children who come from under-privileged backgrounds. He also said he vowed to teach them how to play instruments.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, longtime bassist David Ellefson rejoined Megadeth eight years after its disbanding in 2002. Ellefson and Mustaine agreed to keep any unresolved issues in the past and to work on building and maintaining their friendship again. Ellefson has since said that he feels that \"having that time away created a realization for both of us that while we are both productive individually, Megadeth is definitely stronger with both of us in it together.\" Megadeth embarked on a \"Rust in Peace\" 20th-anniversary tour, playing the album in its entirety, along with fan favorites such as \"Wake Up Dead\", \"In My Darkest Hour\" and \"Skin O' My Teeth\".\nOn June 16, \"The Big Four\" thrash metal bands (Megadeth, Metallica, Anthrax, and Slayer) shared the stage in Warsaw, Poland. The event happened in various other countries like Switzerland, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, the United States, Greece, Turkey, Germany, Sweden and ended at the Yankee Stadium of New York City on September 14, 2011. \"The Big Four\" show in Sofia, Bulgaria was recorded and released on Blu-ray and DVD. In 2016, Mustaine expressed interest in doing more Big 4 shows, although this is unlikely due to the breakup of Slayer.\nOn August 3, 2010, Mustaine released his autobiography in the United States, titled \"Mustaine: A Heavy Metal Memoir\". The book covers Mustaine's life from childhood until the release of the 2009 Megadeth album \"Endgame\". The book was released in the UK, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand under the title \"Mustaine: A Life in Metal\". In December 2011, Mustaine appeared at Metallica's 30th-anniversary celebration at the Fillmore Theater and performed five songs from Metallica's debut album. On October 4, 2014, Mustaine's Alzheimer's-afflicted mother-in-law went missing from a campground. Her remains were discovered on November 26.\nFollowing the release of Megadeth's 14th studio album, \"Super Collider\" in 2013, Megadeth began working on their next album, \"Dystopia\" in 2015. David Ellefson commented that work would commence \"after the first [day] of the year.\" Lineup changes included the departure of lead guitarist Chris Broderick and drummer Shawn Drover, both of whom departed the band in late November 2014, both citing creative differences. Chris Adler of Lamb of God was announced in March 2015 to replace Drover, and Kiko Loureiro of Angra replaced Broderick on lead guitar.\nAt the end of March, Mustaine announced via Twitter that he was \"almost done with the writing,\" and that recording would begin next week. Megadeth finished recording the album in July of that year, with the track listing was also revealed in a meeting between Mustaine and Megadeth's official fan club, the Cyber Army. Mustaine commented in an interview in June that fans are \"gonna be happy,\" because the album is \"really aggressive again,\" and that nothing in the record was too out of the ordinary, apart from small changes in Mustaine's playing due to his brief tenure with the San Diego Symphony. The first single from the new album, \"Fatal Illusion\", was released on October the 1st, which was followed by the release of the title of the album and its release date via Twitter on October the 2nd. The Dystopia World Tour was announced in support of the album, with Children of Bodom, Suicidal Tendencies, and Havok as supporting acts. The next two singles, \"The Threat Is Real\" and \"Dystopia\", were released on November 25 and January 7, 2016, respectively.\nThe album was released on January 22, 2016, and debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200, Megadeth's second-highest-charting album since 1992's \"Countdown to Extinction\". The album was met with generally positive acclaim, with Chad Bowar of Loudwire, calling \"Dystopia\" a \"first-rate Megadeth album, however Slant Magazine's Benjamin Aspray criticizing the lackluster solos, saying that they \"rarely leave much of a mark\", and commenting that Mustaine's voice has \"never sounded so guttural or monotone\". Other critics noted the album's recurrent political themes and commentary on current affairs.\nThe title track of \"Dystopia\" winning the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance at the 59th Grammy Awards in February 2017 would start Megadeth's year. The band would begin touring again, with Megadeth closing that year's edition of Jakarta's Hammersonic Festival in May. Prior to touring, Mustaine also held a \"Megadeth Boot Camp\" in March, where fans would be invited to his home in Fallbrook, California. The bootcamp included lessons on guitar, bass and drums, alongside wine-tasting and a jam session to their 1992 hit \"Symphony of Destruction\".\nIn June in an interview with WRIF's Mark \"Meltdown\" Milligan, Mustaine commented that work on the followup to \"Dystopia\" would begin soon, with recording to start around \"November, December of this year.\"\nThe band would embark on several European shows in August, with Megadeth headlining the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany alongside Volbeat, Accept, and Alice Cooper. They would also headline that years Lokerse Feesten in Belgium, alongside Marilyn Manson and Alice Cooper. Megadeth also performed at that year's Summer Breeze Open Air festival, where Nuclear Blast celebrated their label's 30th anniversary, with the band co-headlining with Korn, Amon Amarth, Kreator and Heaven Shall Burn. Next was an appearance at the Bloodstock Open Air in Walton-on-Trent, co-headlining with Ghost and Amon Amarth. They would finish August with an appearance headlining the Elbriot festival in Hamburg, alongside Trivium and Hatebreed. Following this, Megadeth would tour North America in September alongside Scorpions on their \"Crazy World Tour\", named after the latter band's 1990 LP.\nIn November, Mustaine joined the DJ roster for Gimme Radio, promoting his involvement with Megadeth as well as his favorite music and playlists on \"The Dave Mustaine Show\".\n2020s.\nMegadeth issued a press release in August 2025, announcing that the next album, \"Megadeth\", would be the band's last and that it would launch a farewell tour in 2026.\nGigantour.\nIn the summer of 2005, Mustaine launched a travelling North American metal festival. He named it Gigantour after a favorite childhood cartoon of his, Gigantor. It spanned six weeks and was co-headlined by Megadeth and Dream Theater, with a variety of other supporting metal acts such as Fear Factory and the Dillinger Escape Plan. Mustaine has been quoted as saying that his main intention when conceiving the tour was to bring the American metal audiences an eclectic and affordable alternative to Ozzfest.\nThe second annual Gigantour began in September 2006 and was composed of Megadeth, Lamb of God, Opeth, and Arch Enemy. The second stage bands were Overkill, Into Eternity, Sanctity, and the SmashUp.\nThe 2007 Gigantour featured Bring Me the Horizon, Static-X, DevilDriver, and Lacuna Coil along with Megadeth. Megadeth appeared on their first tour to Bangalore, India in March 2008.\nThe 2008 installment of the tour featured Megadeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, High on Fire, and Job for a Cowboy (and Evile for the UK and Scandinavia tour).\nMegadeth \"\" (from the Gigantour 2008) premiered on HDNet Sunday November 2 at 8 p.m. in high definition and 5.1 audio (Repeats check www.hd.net)\nIn November 2011, it was announced the Gigantour would start up again. The lineup consisted of Megadeth, Mot\u00f6rhead, Volbeat, and Lacuna Coil. The tour kicked off at the Susquehanna Bank Center in Camden, New Jersey on January 26, 2012.\nEquipment.\nAs of 2021, Dave Mustaine uses Gibson guitars. The Dave Mustaine Collection was launched February 2021 in partnership with Gibson, and will span acoustic and electric guitars across the Gibson, Epiphone, and Kramer ranges.\nMustaine used B.C. Rich guitars early in his career (and for his entire duration with Metallica), most notably a B.C. Rich Bich 10 string with just the regular six strings. First the guitar started in a natural finish, but Mustaine painted it black around the time 'Peace Sells' was released. In 1987, he switched to Jackson Guitars. In March 2009, while he was guest hosting Bruce Dickinson's Friday night radio show, Mustaine attributed his choice of the Flying V guitar to being a fan of UFO's Michael Schenker when he was growing up.\nAfter switching to Jackson Guitars he helped to re-design the guitar maker's version of the King V model (at the time, it was a \"double Rhoads size\" meaning it had two of the longer fins from the RR). The reshaped Mustaine KV1 model had slightly shorter fins, Kahler bridge and Seymour Duncan TB-5 bridge and SH-4 neck pickups. He also specified 24 frets rather than the original King V's 22, a tradition that Jackson still keeps on its King V models today, and the KV1, as have all of Mustaine's signature models, also featured a smaller, medium fretwire compared to the extra jumbos featured on most Jacksons.\nMustaine later switched to ESP Guitars. The company released the DV8 signature model in the 2004 NAMM convention also at which time Mustaine announced his ESP endorsement deal. In 2005, Mustaine and ESP teamed up to release the ESP Axxion, (pronounced Action), in order to celebrate Megadeth's 20th anniversary. The ESP Axxion and ESP DV8 were both successful and cheaper models such as the LTD-DV8 R, LTD DV200 and the LTD Axxion were released to target a bigger market.\nHowever, on December 6, 2006, Mustaine announced that he was leaving ESP and shifting his endorsement to Dean Guitars. His new signature guitar was revealed during NAMM Show on January 19, 2007. The signature guitar is called the Dean VMNT. The V-shaped guitar is very similar to his earlier Jackson and ESP Signature models. The release campaign of the VMNT had a limited copy of only 150 in the world and are signed by Mustaine.\n\"After two successful years, I have decided to leave ESP guitars. This was a business decision and had nothing to do with the guitars or the manufacturing of the guitars, and I wish the staff of ESP, both in the USA and in Japan and Korea the very best of health and prosperity. Meanwhile, I am taking my Classic Metal V known formerly as a Jackson King V1 or an ESP DV8, and my new guitar design presently known as an Axxion, which was the recipient of the Gold Award from Guitar World Magazine for 2005 for new guitar designs with me. I will also be re-introducing through my new endorsement many special models, including re-issues of my old models from over the span of my career, as well as some retro V shapes, similar to the formerly known Jackson Y2KV or a Gibson Flying V. I will make my announcement and be attending the 2007 NAMM show to meet Megadeth fans and all metal fans, musicians of all styles-especially guitarists.\"\nUntil 2021 he used his signature models by made by Dean Guitars, the Dean VMNT and Zero. The US models were available briefly in limited run after release, although the Korean and Chinese models are in continuous production. Mustaine used the US and Korean models on stage.\nIn February 2021, Mustaine announced that he was leaving Dean Guitars and shifting his endorsement to Gibson.\nMustaine has also recently collaborated with Marshall Amplification in order to produce the 1960DM Dave Mustaine Signature Cabinets. He is now using his signature Marshall cabinets on tour.\nMustaine endorses Seymour Duncan and has his own Signature Live Wire pickups and uses Cleartone strings (.011 \u2013 .054 for D tuning, .010 \u2013 .052 for E tuning). The Seymour Duncan Dave Mustaine Signature Live Wire pickups were announced at NAMM 2015 and the official product video was performed by Danny Young on the Seymour Duncan YouTube channel.\nThe Dean Zero debuted in 2010 with Dean guitars was a unique new shape for Mustaine, resembling the Gibson Explorer with sharper points. Mustaine has made a few appearances with this guitar, performing on \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" and on shows during the Australian tour with Slayer. He had also used the guitar in the later dates of the 2009 Endgame tour. He says he primarily still used his VMNT's so he can grab on to the lower horn with his legs for certain songs. He had also used Ovation acoustic guitars for most of his career. However, he stopped endorsing the company after receiving a signature acoustic from Dean, dubbed the Mako.\nMustaine has his own signature Zoom pedal, called the Zoom G2.1DM.\nIn 2022, Mustaine switched from using a Fractal Axe-FX to a Neural DSP Quad Cortex on tour for his amp tones, sending the signal to a Seymour Duncan PowerStage poweramp and then to on-stage speaker cabinets.\nMusicianship.\nMustaine is known for popularizing the \"spider chord\" technique for playing power chords, a method streamlining hand position changes and reducing string noise.\nMustaine possesses a two-octave vocal range spanning from tenor through baritone pitch ranges.\nIn 2004, \"Guitar World\" magazine ranked Mustaine and Marty Friedman together at No. 19 on the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of All Time.\nIn 2009, Mustaine was named the No. 1 player in Joel McIver's book \"The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists\". As he told \"Classic Rock\" magazine in September 2009: \"It was especially sweet when I found out that Joel has written books on Metallica. Every page I turned, I became more excited. I get to Number 5 and it's Kirk Hammett, and I thought, 'Thank you, God'. At that point it didn't matter [which position I was]. To be better than both of them [James Hetfield and Hammett] meant so much \u2013 it's been one of the pet peeves of my career and I've never known how to deal with it. All I thought was\u00a0\u2013 I win!\"\nIn 2012, Mustaine was ranked the 12th-greatest guitarist of all time by a \"Guitar World\" magazine reader's poll.\nPersonal life.\nMustaine married Pamela Anne Casselberry in 1991. They have two children together: Justis Mustaine (born 1992), who also plays the guitar and has appeared in several local theatrical productions, and Electra Mustaine (born 1998), who is pursuing a career in country music. As of 2014[ [update]], they live in Nashville, Tennessee. \nHealth.\nIn 2011, Mustaine said that his neck and spine condition, known as stenosis, was caused by many years of headbanging.\nOn June 17, 2019, Mustaine announced that he had been diagnosed with throat cancer, and on January 31, 2020, during a Megadeth concert, he announced that he was now cancer free.\nChristianity.\nMustaine was raised as a Jehovah's Witness and is now a born again Christian. In 1988, in response to the British government's Section 28, Mustaine said: \"More power to them. It says in the Bible that men should not lay with men like they lay with women. I mean I don't wanna fuck up and not go to heaven.\" In an answer to a question about Judas Priest having an overt homosexual image, Mustaine stated \"I don't wanna talk about this.\" In 2012, on KIRO-FM he was asked if he supports gay marriage and replied: \"Well, since I'm not gay, the answer to that would be no.\" He was then asked if he would support legislation to make gay marriage legal and said, \"I'm Christian. The answer to that would be no.\"\nMustaine began to focus on his Christian faith more directly while attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and became a committed Christian. It has become his policy not to appear with any band that is seen as black metal or satanic, such as declining to appear in a music festival in Greece with the band Rotting Christ as well as in Israel with the band Dissection.\nMustaine had practiced black magic in his teenage years, which inspired several songs on Megadeth's second album, \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" Mustaine stated that he no longer wishes to play those tracks because of his changed spiritual beliefs. He said of one such song, \"The Conjuring\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Performance wise, 'The Conjuring' is one of the heaviest songs on the record, but unfortunately it's got black magic in it and I promised that I wouldn't play it any more, because there's a lot of instructions for hexes in that song. When I got into black magic I put a couple of spells on people when I was a teenager and it haunted me forever, and I've had so much torment. So I look back now and I think, 'Hmm, I don't wanna play \"The Conjuring\".'\nHowever, in 2016, Mustaine noted that Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler's suggestion of re-recording the song with modified lyrics made him consider playing \"The Conjuring\" again, \"as long as it doesn't hurt anybody\".\nRelationship with Metallica.\nOriginally stemming his firing from Metallica in April 1983, Mustaine frequently expressed feelings of hostility towards his former bandmates, particularly Kirk Hammett who had replaced him. Following Megadeth's rise to fame in the mid-1980s, Mustaine made inflammatory statements about Metallica and Hammett. Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, however, developed admiration for Mustaine's compositions, praising his work during a 1985 MTV interview. Ulrich later expressed further praise for Megadeth following the release of Peace Sells... But Who's Buying? in 1986. Despite this, Mustaine continued to attack Metallica in several interviews, including a drunken rant during a show in Oakland, California on March 10, 1988, in which he directed insults at Metallica's replacement bassist Jason Newsted whilst Ulrich and frontman James Hetfield watched the performance from backstage.\nTensions between Mustaine and Ulrich appeared to have subsided shortly thereafter, as the two were photographed together with several members of Guns N' Roses at that year's Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington. During a 1991 interview; Ulrich said that he and Mustaine had reconciled and had built a friendlier relationship despite their previous hostility. Kirk Hammett said that Mustaine had approached him before a concert in 1989 and apologized for his previous comments. Mustaine's relationship with Metallica continued to improve over the following years, and the two bands performed together on multiple European tour dates in June 1993. In September 2001, Ulrich invited Mustaine to conduct an interview for Metallica's documentary. Mustaine emotionally described his struggles with both his substance abuse history and comparing his own career to that of Metallica's. Metallica reiterated their reconciliation with Mustaine in 2010 prior to their announcement of the tour alongside Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica invited Mustaine to perform as a part of their 30th anniversary shows on December 7, 2011, in which they sought to reunite all previous members of the band dating back to their founding.\nIn the wake of the Big Four shows with Metallica, the relationship between the two soured once again. Following the critical and commercial failure of Lulu in 2011, Hetfield had also briefly begun to rekindle a cordial relationship with Mustaine. At some point in 2015, Mustaine began to approach Hetfield with a proposal for a future collaborative effort between the two, including a possible remaster of their 1982 demo No Life 'Til Leather. Unwilling to participate in Mustaine's proposals, Hetfield later expressed his discontent with Mustaine hinting at rumors of the two collaborating on new music projects. Despite initial disapproval, Ulrich later convinced Hetfield to reconsider pursuing a remastered release of the \"No Life 'Til Leather\" demo with Mustaine's involvement a year later. However, a dispute over Ulrich requesting credit on all tracks resulted in the cancellation of the project entirely and reignited tensions with his former bandmates.\nPolitics.\nOver his career, Mustaine has made numerous comments about both American and international politics, criticizing both politicians and political issues. In addition, Mustaine covered the 1992 Democratic National Convention for MTV.\nIn a 1988 interview with \"Sounds\" journalist Roy Wilkinson, Mustaine spoke against illegal immigration, and stated that he would \"build a great wall along the Mexican border and not let anybody in...\" if he were President of the United States.\nIn 1988, Mustaine caused a riot when Megadeth played a concert in Northern Ireland after he dedicated a song to \"the cause,\" later expressing surprise that this was a euphemism for supporting the Irish Republican Army in the conflict between Northern Ireland's Catholic and Protestant communities known as the Troubles.\nIn 2009, Mustaine was interviewed by far-right conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones for \"InfoWars\", in which Mustaine stated that the album \"Endgame\" was inspired by his Christian beliefs and belief in an upcoming New World Order. In a 2016 \"Fox Business\" interview, Mustaine stated that he does not align himself with any established political party, describing himself as an Independent.\nCriticism of Barack Obama and 2012 U.S. presidential election.\nIn the 2010s, Mustaine grew increasingly vocal in his support of many Republican figures and positions, which is a change from his politics during the George H. W. Bush administration, when Mustaine acted as a reporter for MTV News during the Democratic National Convention in 1992, and was seen as leaning to the political left, in light of the lyrics of \"Foreclosure of a Dream\".\nMustaine has criticized several Democratic Party politicians. During the 2004 presidential campaign, Mustaine commented that he believed that John Kerry would \"ruin our country.\" In addition, Mustaine made several comments critical of president Barack Obama, calling him \"the most divisive president we've ever had\" in 2011, and commenting that he believed that Obama was born outside of the United States during a March 2012 interview on \"George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight\".\nIn an August 2012 Singapore performance on the tour to support the band's then-new album \"Thirteen\", Mustaine expressed his views of President Obama and recent gun violence in the United States, making an accusation that Obama had staged the shootings at Aurora, Colorado, and a Wisconsin Sikh temple in order to push a gun control agenda, while engaging the audience during onstage banter in between songs. Mustaine also criticized the 'Fast and Furious' arms scandal and said that the country looked like it was turning into \"Nazi America.\"\nMustaine's comments drew criticism from wounded Aurora massacre survivor Carli Richards, who said Mustaine was being \"absurd\" and that his conspiracy theory shifted blame away from the shooter, noting that \"[the president] didn't shoot me.\" In response to the controversy over his comments, Mustaine told Alex Jones that his comments were done \"in the heat of the moment.\" He also denied any intention to hurt anyone with his comments, but believed that the possibility of a conspiracy should still be looked into.\nIn February 2012, Mustaine gave a statement supportive of the presidential campaign of conservative Republican and former United States Senator Rick Santorum. Mustaine commented on Santorum's \"presidential qualities\" and pointed to Santorum's temporary suspension of his campaign to be with his sick daughter as the act that gained his attention and respect. However, Mustaine denied that his statement was intended as an endorsement of Santorum. He expressed his hope that Santorum would win the nomination but stated that, regardless of the results, he would be voting against a second term for President Obama. Mustaine also criticized other Republican presidential candidates: he was critical of a $100 million trust fund that Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney set up for his sons and criticized Texas Congressman Ron Paul for his unorthodox political views, saying Paul \"make[s] total sense for a while, and then he'll say something so way out that it negates everything else.\" Mustaine also admitted that he once supported former Georgia Congressman and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, but that he no longer thought he could vote for him.\nMartial arts.\nMustaine holds black belts in taekwondo and Ukidokan karate. In 2007, he was made a Goodwill Ambassador of the World by the World Taekwondo Federation. Mustaine has also trained Sanshou and Kickboxing and has recently become a dedicated practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. In January 2021, he was awarded the rank of Purple Belt in the art. Shortly after Megadeth released their sixteenth studio album, Mustaine was promoted to brown belt in BJJ at the age of 61. In his spare time he enjoys watching the UFC.\nWinery.\nMustaine first got into the wine business in 2013 when Megadeth collaborated with the San Diego Symphony, which inspired the 2013 Symphony Interrupted Cabernet Sauvignon. In 2015 Mustaine then started his own winery called House of Mustaine, which is located in Nashville, Tennessee, Mustaine also owns to vineyards in Italy and California. Each limited-production wine is named after a Megadeth song and is stamped with the Mustaine family crest. Starting in 2025 his company started offering luxury wine-related excursions.\nIn addition his band Megadeth also have their own official beer line which he launched in 2016. All the cans feature the bands mascot Vic Rattlehead and with the names being references to song names. In 2017 their first signature brew '\u00c0 Tout le Monde' has won a Gold Medal. The beer is distributed in multiple countries in Europe, and as of 2025 they have sold over 15 million pints. In 2025 Mustaine launched the Rattlehead beer range in the UK.\nTelevision appearances.\nMustaine has appeared on various television shows:\nDiscography.\nMustaine composed the song \"Sudden Death\" for the video game \"\", released in September 2010, under the name of his band. The game also features two additional Megadeth titles, \"Holy Wars... The Punishment Due\" and \"This Day We Fight!\". Megadeth downloadable content was available for the game but as of March 31, 2015, the tracks were removed as all DLC for the game was removed; the tracks that were available for purchase were \"Symphony of Destruction\", \"Hangar 18\", and \"Peace Sells\".\nMustaine appeared on country singer Brett Kissel's song \"Damn!\" from his 2017 album \"We Were That Song\".\nAwards and nominations.\n\"See also List of awards and nominations received by Megadeth.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61024", "revid": "41798688", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61024", "title": "Charleston, South Carolina", "text": "City in South Carolina, United States\nCharleston is the most populous city in the U.S. state of South Carolina. The city lies just south of the geographical midpoint of South Carolina's coastline on Charleston Harbor, an inlet of the Atlantic Ocean formed by the confluence of the Ashley, Cooper, and Wando rivers. Charleston had a population of 150,227 at the 2020 census, while the Charleston metropolitan area, comprising Berkeley, Charleston, and Dorchester counties, has an estimated 870,000 residents. It ranks as the third-most populous metropolitan area in the state and the 71st-most populous in the U.S. It is the county seat of Charleston County.\nCharleston was founded by the English in 1670 as Charles Town, named in honor of King CharlesII. Originally established at Albemarle Point on the west bank of the Ashley River (now Charles Towne Landing), the settlement was moved in 1680 to its present location, where it quickly grew to become the fifth-largest city in North America by the 1690s. During the colonial period, Charleston remained unincorporated and was governed by a colonial legislature and a royal governor, with administrative districts and social services organized by Anglican parishes. Although the state capital was relocated to Columbia in 1788, Charleston remained among the top 10 U.S. cities by population through 1840. A significant part of Charleston's history is its central role in the Atlantic slave trade; local merchants, including Joseph Wragg, helped break the monopoly of the Royal African Company, making Charleston a primary entry point for enslaved Africans. Almost one-half of enslaved people imported to the United States arrived in Charleston. In 2018, the city formally apologized for its role in the American slave trade.\nThe economy of Charleston is anchored by tourism, port and logistics, aerospace, and information technology. The city is home to the Port of Charleston, one of the busiest in the United States, which significantly contributes to regional trade and economic activity. Boeing and other major employers have established a strong aerospace presence, while its growing tech industry has led to the nickname \"Silicon Harbor\". Culturally, Charleston is renowned for its well-preserved architecture, historic landmarks, and rich Gullah heritage, alongside vibrant culinary, music, and arts scenes. Popular attractions include the historic City Market, Fort Sumter National Monument, and antebellum homes along the Battery and Rainbow Row.\nHistory.\nNative American settlement.\nThe unified Cusabo people (including sub tribes such as Kiawah) and the Ittiwan people inhabited the area prior to colonial settlement. They were known as \"Settlement Indians\" by colonists.\nColonial era (1670\u20131776).\nKing Charles II granted the chartered Province of Carolina to eight of his loyal friends, known as the Lords Proprietors, on March 24, 1663. In 1670, Governor William Sayle arranged for several shiploads of settlers from Bermuda and Barbados. These settlers established what was then called Charles Town at Albemarle Point, on the west bank of the Ashley River, a few miles northwest of the present-day city center. Charles Town became the first comprehensively planned town in the Thirteen Colonies. Its governance, settlement, and development were to follow a visionary plan known as the Grand Model prepared for the Lord's Proprietors by John Locke. Because the Carolina's Fundamental Constitutions was never ratified, however, Charles Town was never incorporated during the colonial period. Instead, local ordinances were passed by the provincial government, with day-to-day administration handled by the wardens and vestries of StPhilip's and StMichael's Anglican parishes.\nAt the time of European colonization, the area was inhabited by the indigenous Cusabo, on whom the settlers declared war in October 1671. The settlers initially allied with the Westo, a northern indigenous tribe that traded in enslaved Indians. The settlers abandoned their alliance with the Westo in 1679 and allied with the Cusabo instead.\nThe initial settlement quickly dwindled and disappeared while another village\u2014established by the settlers on Oyster Point at the confluence of the Ashley and Cooper rivers around 1672\u2014thrived. In 1680, this second settlement formally replaced the original Charles Town, which today is commemorated as Charles Towne Landing. The second location was more defensible and had access to a fine natural harbor. The new town had become the fifth largest in North America by 1690.\nA smallpox outbreak erupted in 1698, followed by an earthquake in February 1699. The latter caused a fire that destroyed about a third of the town. During rebuilding, a yellow fever outbreak killed about 15% of the remaining inhabitants. Charles Town suffered between five and eight significant yellow fever outbreaks over the first half of the 18th century.\nIt developed a reputation as one of the least healthy locations in the Thirteen Colonies for ethnic Europeans. Malaria was endemic. Although malaria did not have such high mortality as yellow fever, it caused much illness. It was a major health problem throughout most of the city's history before dying out in the 1950s after the use of pesticides cut down on the mosquitoes that transmitted it.\nCharles Town was fortified according to a plan developed in 1704 under Governor Nathaniel Johnson. Both Spain and France contested Britain's claims to the region. Various bands of Native Americans and independent pirates also raided it.\nOn September 5\u20136, 1713 (O.S.), a violent hurricane passed over Charles Town. The Circular Congregational Church manse was damaged during the storm, and church records were lost. Much of Charles Town was flooded as \"the Ashley and Cooper rivers became one.\" At least seventy people died in the disaster.\nFrom the 1670s, Charleston attracted pirates. The combination of a weak government and corruption made the city popular with pirates, who frequently visited and raided the city. Charles Town was besieged by the pirate Blackbeard for several days in May 1718. Blackbeard released his hostages and left in exchange for a chest of medicine from Governor Robert Johnson.\nAround 1719, the town's name began to be generally written as Charlestown and, excepting those fronting the Cooper River, the old walls were largely removed over the next decade. Charlestown was a center for the inland colonization of South Carolina. It remained the southernmost point of the Southern Colonies until the Province of Georgia was established in 1732. As noted, the first settlers primarily came from Europe, Barbados and Bermuda. The Barbadian and Bermudan immigrants were planters who brought enslaved Africans with them, having purchased them in the West Indies.\nEarly immigrant groups to the city included the Huguenots, Scottish, Irish, and Germans, as well as hundreds of Jews, predominately Sephardi from London and significant cities of the Dutch Republic, where they had been given refuge. As late as 1830, Charleston's Jewish community was the most prominent and wealthiest in North America.\nBy 1708, most of the colony's population were Black Africans. They had been brought to Charlestown via the Atlantic slave trade, first as indentured servants and then as enslaved people. In the early 1700s, Charleston's largest slave trader, Joseph Wragg, pioneered the settlement's involvement in the slave trade. Of the estimated 400,000 captive Africans transported to North America to be sold into slavery, 40% are thought to have landed at Sullivan's Island off Charlestown. Free people of color also migrated from the West Indies, being descendants of white planters and their Black consorts and unions among the working classes.\nIn 1767, Gadsden's Wharf was constructed at the city port on the Cooper River; it ultimately extended 840 feet and could accommodate six ships at a time. Many enslaved people were sold from here. Devoted to plantation agriculture that depended on enslaved labor, South Carolina became a slave society: it had a majority-Black population from the colonial period until after the Great Migration of the early 20th century, when many rural Blacks moved to northern and midwestern industrial cities to escape Jim Crow laws.\nAt the foundation of the town, the principal items of commerce were pine timber and pitch for ships and tobacco. The early economy developed around the deerskin trade, in which colonists used alliances with the Cherokee and Creek peoples to secure the raw material.\nAt the same time, Native Americans kidnapped and enslaved each other in warfare. From 1680 to 1720, approximately 40,000 native men, women, and children were sold through the port, principally to the West Indies such as (Bermuda and the Bahamas), but also to other Southern colonies. The Lowcountry planters did not keep enslaved Native Americans, considering them too prone to escape or revolt. They used the proceeds of their sale to purchase enslaved Black Africans for their own plantations. The slave raiding\u2014and the European firearms it introduced\u2014helped destabilize Spanish Florida and French Louisiana in the 1700s during the War of the Spanish Succession. But it also provoked the Yamasee War of the 1710s that nearly destroyed the colony. After that, South Carolina largely abandoned the Indian slave trade.\nThe area's unsuitability for growing tobacco prompted the Lowcountry planters to experiment with other cash crops. The profitability of growing rice led the planters to pay premiums for enslaved people from the \"Rice Coast\" who knew its cultivation; their descendants make up the ethnic Gullah who created their own culture and language in this area. Slaves imported from the Caribbean showed the planter George Lucas's daughter Eliza how to raise and use indigo for dyeing in 1747.\nThroughout this period, enslaved people were sold aboard the arriving ships or at ad hoc gatherings in the town's taverns. Runaways and minor slave rebellions prompted the 1739 Security Act, which required all white men to carry weapons at all times (even to church on Sundays). Before it fully took effect, the Cato or Stono Rebellion broke out. The white community had recently been decimated by a malaria outbreak, and the rebels killed about 25 white people before being stopped by the colonial militia. As a result of their fears of rebellion, whites killed a total of 35 to 50 Black people.\nThe planters attributed the violence to recently imported Africans and agreed to a 10-year moratorium on slave importation through Charlestown. They relied for labor upon the slave communities they already held. The 1740 Negro Act also tightened controls, requiring a ratio of one white for every ten Blacks on any plantation (which was often not achieved) and banning enslaved people from assembling, growing personal food, earning money, or learning to read. Drums were banned because Africans used them for signaling; enslaved people were allowed to use string and other instruments. When the moratorium expired and Charlestown reopened to the slave trade in 1750, the memory of the Stono Rebellion resulted in traders avoiding buying enslaved people from the Congo and Angola, whose populations had a reputation for independence.\nBy the mid-18th century, Charlestown was the hub of the Atlantic slave trade in the Southern Colonies. Even with the decade-long moratorium, its customs processed around 40% of the enslaved Africans brought to North America between 1700 and 1775, and about half up until the end of the African trade.\nThe plantations and the economy based on them made this the wealthiest city in the Thirteen Colonies and the largest in population south of Philadelphia. In 1770, the city had 11,000 inhabitants\u2014half enslaved\u2014and was the 4th-largest port in the colonies, after Boston, New York City, and Philadelphia.\nThe elite began to use their wealth to encourage cultural and social development. America's first theater building was constructed in 1736; today's Dock Street Theater later replaced it. StMichael's was erected in 1753. Benevolent societies were formed by the Huguenots, free people of color, Germans, and Jews. The Library Society was established in 1748 by well-born young men who wanted to share the financial cost of keeping up with the scientific and philosophical issues of the day.\nAmerican Revolution (1776\u20131783).\nDelegates for the Continental Congress were elected in 1774, and South Carolina declared its independence from Britain on the steps of the Exchange. Slavery was again an important factor in the city's role during the Revolutionary War. The British attacked the settlement three times, assuming that the settlement had a large base of Loyalists who would rally to their cause once given some military support. The loyalty of white Southerners towards the Crown had largely been forfeited, however, by British legal cases (such as the 1772 Somersett case which marked the prohibition of slavery in England and Wales, a significant milestone in the abolitionist struggle) and military tactics (such as Dunmore's Proclamation in 1775) that promised the emancipation of people enslaved by Patriot planters; these efforts did, however, unsurprisingly win the allegiance of thousands of Black Loyalists.\nThe Battle of Sullivan's Island saw the British fail to capture a partially constructed palmetto palisade from Col. Moultrie's militia regiment on June 28, 1776. The Liberty Flag used by Moultrie's men formed the basis of the later South Carolina flag, and the victory's anniversary continues to be commemorated as Carolina Day.\nMaking the capture of Charlestown their chief priority, the British sent Sir Henry Clinton, who laid siege to Charleston on April 1, 1780, with about 14,000 troops and 90 ships. Bombardment began on March 11, 1780. The Patriots, led by Benjamin Lincoln, had about 5,500 men and inadequate fortifications to repel the forces against them. After the British cut his supply lines and lines of retreat at the battles of Monck's Corner and Lenud's Ferry, Lincoln's surrender on May 12, 1780, became the greatest American defeat of the war.\nThe British continued to hold Charlestown for over a year following their defeat at Yorktown in 1781. However, they alienated local planters by refusing to restore full civil government. Nathanael Greene had entered the state after Cornwallis's pyrrhic victory at Guilford Courthouse and kept the area under a kind of siege. British Army officer Alexander Leslie, commanding Charlestown, requested a truce in March 1782 to purchase food for his garrison and the town's inhabitants. Greene refused and formed a brigade under Mordecai Gist to counter British forays. The British finally evacuated Charlestown in December 1782. Greene presented the British leaders of the town with the Moultrie Flag.\nAntebellum era (1783\u20131861).\nBetween the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, Charleston experienced an economic boom, at least for the top strata of society. Expanding cotton as a cash crop in the South led to massive wealth for a small segment of society and funded impressive architecture and culture. However, it also escalated the economic importance of enslaving people and led to greater and greater restrictions on Black Charlestonians.\nBy 1783, the city's growth had reached a point where a municipal government became desirable; therefore, on August 13, 1783, an act of incorporation for Charleston was ratified. The act originally specified the city's name as \"Charles Ton\", as opposed to the previous Charlestown, but the spelling \"Charleston\" quickly came to dominate.\nAlthough Columbia had replaced it as the state capital in 1788, Charleston became even more prosperous as Eli Whitney's 1793 invention of the cotton gin sped the processing of the crop over 50 times. Britain's Industrial Revolution\u2014initially built upon its textile industry\u2014took up the extra production ravenously and cotton became Charleston's major export commodity in the 19th century.\nThe Bank of South Carolina, the second-oldest building in the nation to be constructed as a bank, was established in 1798. In 1800 and 1817, branches of the First and Second banks were also located in Charleston.\nThroughout the Antebellum Period, Charleston continued to be the only major American city with a majority-slave population. The city's widespread use of enslaved people as workers was a frequent subject of writers and visitors: a merchant from Liverpool noted in 1834 that \"almost all the working population are Negroes, all the servants, the carmen &amp; porters, all the people who see at the stalls in Market, and most of the Journeymen in trades\". American traders had been prohibited from equipping the Atlantic slave trade in 1794 and all importation of enslaved people was banned in 1808, but American merchantmen frequently refused to permit British inspection for enslaved cargo, and smuggling remained common. Much more important was the domestic slave trade, which boomed as the Deep South developed into new cotton plantations. As a result of the trade, there was a forced migration of more than one million enslaved people from the Upper South to the Lower South in the antebellum years. During the early 19th century, the first dedicated slave markets were founded in Charleston, mostly near Chalmers and State streets. Many domestic slavers used Charleston as a port in the coastwise trade, traveling to such ports as Mobile and New Orleans.\nEnslaving was the primary marker of class, and even the town's freedmen and free people of color typically enslaved people if they had the wealth to do so. Visitors commonly remarked on the sheer number of Blacks in Charleston and their seeming freedom of movement, though in fact\u2014mindful of the Stono Rebellion and the slave revolution that established Haiti\u2014the whites closely regulated the behavior of both enslaved and free people of color. The town fixed wages and hiring practices, sometimes required identifying badges, and sometimes censored work songs. Punishment was handled out of sight by the city's workhouse, whose fees provided the municipal government with thousands a year. In 1820, state law mandated that each act of manumission (freeing an enslaved person) required legislative approval, effectively halting the practice.\nThe effects of slavery were pronounced on white society as well. The high cost of enslaving people in the 19th century and their high rate of return combined to institute an oligarchic society controlled by about ninety interrelated families, where 4% of the free population controlled half of the wealth, and the lower half of the free population\u2014unable to compete with enslaved or rented people\u2014held no wealth at all. The white middle class was minimal: Charlestonians generally looked down upon hard work, considering it as labor meant for enslaved people. All the enslavers taken together held 82% of the city's wealth and almost all non-enslavers were poor. Olmsted considered their civic elections \"entirely contests of money and personal influence\" and the oligarchs dominated civic planning: The lack of public parks and amenities was noted, as was the abundance of private gardens in the wealthy's walled estates.\nIn the 1810s, the town's churches intensified their discrimination against their Black parishioners, culminating in Bethel Methodist's 1817 construction of a hearse house over its Black burial ground. 4,376 Black Methodists joined Morris Brown in establishing Hampstead Church, the African Methodist Episcopal church now known as Mother Emanuel. State and city laws prohibited Black literacy, limited Black worship to daylight hours, and required a majority of any church's parishioners be white. In June 1818, 140 Black church members at Hampstead Church were arrested, and eight of its leaders were given fines and ten lashes; police raided the church again in 1820 and pressured it in 1821.\nIn 1822, members of the church, led by Denmark Vesey, a lay preacher and carpenter who had bought his freedom after winning a lottery, planned an uprising and escape to Haiti\u2014initially for Bastille Day\u2014that failed when one enslaved person revealed the plot to his enslaver. Over the next month, the city's intendant (mayor) James Hamilton Jr. organized a militia for regular patrols, initiated a secret and extrajudicial tribunal to investigate, and hanged 35 and exiled 35 or 37 enslaved people to Spanish Cuba for their involvement. Hamilton imposed more restrictions on both free and enslaved Blacks: South Carolina required free Black sailors to be imprisoned while their ships were in Charleston Harbor, although international treaties eventually required the United States to quash the practice; free Blacks were banned from returning to the state if they left for any reason; enslaved people were given a 9:15\u00a0pm curfew; the city razed Hampstead Church to the ground and erected a new arsenal. This structure later was the basis of the Citadel's first campus. The AME congregation built a new church, but in 1834, the city banned it and all Black worship services following Nat Turner's Rebellion in Virginia in 1831. The estimated 10% of enslaved people who came to America as Muslims never had a separate mosque. Enslavers sometimes provided them with beef rations instead of pork in recognition of religious traditions.\nThe registered tonnage of Charleston shipping in 1829 was 12,410. In 1832, South Carolina passed an ordinance of nullification, a procedure by which a state could, in effect, repeal a federal law; it was directed against the most recent tariff acts. Soon, U.S. soldiers were dispensed to Charleston's forts, and five United States Coast Guard cutters were detached to Charleston Harbor \"to take possession of any vessel arriving from a foreign port, and defend her against any attempt to dispossess the Customs Officers of her custody until all the requirements of law have been complied with.\" This federal action became known as the Charleston incident. The state's politicians worked on a compromise law in Washington to gradually reduce the tariffs.\nCharleston's embrace of classical architecture began after a devastating fire leveled much of the city. On April 27, 1838, Charleston suffered a catastrophic fire that burned more than 1000 buildings and caused about $3 million () in damage at the time. The damaged buildings amounted to about one-fourth of all the businesses in the main part of the city. A great cultural awakening occurred when many homes and businesses were rebuilt or repaired. Before the fire, few homes were styled as Greek Revival; many residents decided to construct new buildings in that style after the conflagration. This tradition continued, making Charleston one of the foremost places to view Greek Revival architecture. The Gothic Revival also made a significant appearance in the construction of many churches after the fire that exhibited picturesque forms and reminders of devout European religion.\nBy 1840, the Market Hall and Sheds, where fresh meat and produce were brought daily, became a hub of commercial activity. The slave trade also depended on the port of Charleston, where ships could be unloaded and enslaved people bought and sold. The legal importation of enslaved Africans had ended in 1808, although smuggling was significant. However, the domestic trade was booming. More than one million enslaved people were transported from the Upper South to the Deep South in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations were widely developed through what became known as the Black Belt. Many enslaved people were transported in the coastwise slave trade, with slave ships stopping at ports such as Charleston.\nAmerican Civil War (1861\u20131865).\nCharleston was significant in the American Civil War. As a pivotal city, the U.S. Army and Confederate States Army vied for control of it. The rebellion began in Charleston Harbor in 1861 and ended mere months after the U.S. soldiers retook control of Charleston in 1865.\nFollowing the election of Abraham Lincoln, the South Carolina General Assembly voted on December 20, 1860, to declare secession from the United States, becoming the first state to do so. On December 27, the U.S. Army garrison of Castle Pinckney surrendered to the state militia. On January 9, 1861, Citadel cadets opened fire on the USS\"Star of the West\" as it entered Charleston Harbor.\nThe first full battle of the war occurred on April 12, 1861, when shore batteries under the command of General P. G. T. Beauregard fired upon the US Army-held Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. After a 34-hour bombardment, Major Robert Anderson surrendered the fort.\nOn December 11, 1861, an enormous fire burned over of the city.\nU.S. Navy control of the North Atlantic coastline permitted the repeated bombardment of the city, causing vast damage. Although Admiral Du Pont's naval assault on the town's forts in April 1863 failed, the U.S. Navy's blockade shut down most commercial traffic. Throughout the war, some blockade runners got through, but not a single one made it into or out of Charleston Harbor between August 1863 and March 1864. The early submarine \"H.L. Hunley\" made a night attack on the on February 17, 1864.\nGeneral Gillmore's land assault in July 1864 was unsuccessful but the fall of Columbia and advance of General William T. Sherman's army through the state prompted the Confederates to evacuate the town on February 17, 1865, burning the public buildings, cotton warehouses, and other sources of supply before their departure. U.S. soldiers liberated the city within the month. The War Department recovered what federal property remained. Also, it confiscated the campus of the Citadel Military Academy and used it as a U.S. Army garrison for the next 17 years. The facilities were finally returned to the state and reopened as a military college in 1882 under the direction of Lawrence E. Marichak.\nPostbellum (1865\u20131945).\nReconstruction.\nAfter the defeat of the Confederacy, U.S. soldiers remained in Charleston during the Reconstruction era. The war had shattered the city's prosperity. Still, the African-American population surged (from 17,000 in 1860 to over 27,000 in 1880) as freedmen moved from the countryside to the major city. Blacks quickly left the Southern Baptist Church and resumed open meetings of the African Methodist Episcopal and AME Zion churches. They purchased dogs, guns, liquor, and better clothes\u2014all previously banned\u2014and ceased yielding the sidewalks to whites. Despite the efforts of the state legislature to halt manumissions, Charleston had already had a large class of free people of color as well. At the onset of the war, the city had 3,785 free people of color, many of mixed race, making up about 18% of the city's black population and 8% of its total population. Many were educated and practiced skilled crafts; they quickly became leaders of South Carolina's Republican Party and its legislators. Free men of color comprised 26% of those elected to state and federal office in South Carolina from 1868 to 1876.\nThe Pacific Guano Company, established in 1861, opened a plant in Charleston which consumed immense quantities of menhaden scrap brought from the water by the vessels which carried on their return trip a supply of South Carolina phosphates for the Woods Hole, Massachusetts factory. By the late 1870s, industry was bringing the city and its inhabitants back to a renewed vitality; new jobs attracted new residents. As the city's commerce improved, residents worked to restore or create community institutions. In 1865, the Avery Normal Institute was established by the American Missionary Association as the first free secondary school for Charleston's African American population. Gen. Sherman lent his support to the conversion of the United States Arsenal into the Porter Military Academy, an educational facility for former soldiers and boys left orphaned or destitute by the war. Porter Military Academy later joined with Gaud School and is now a university-preparatory school, Porter-Gaud School.\nIn 1875, blacks made up 57% of the city's and 73% of the county's population. With leadership by members of the antebellum free black community, historian Melinda Meeks Hennessy described the community as \"unique\" in being able to defend themselves without provoking \"massive white retaliation\", as occurred in numerous other areas during Reconstruction. In the 1876 election cycle, two major riots between black Republicans and white Democrats occurred in the city, in September and the day after the election in November, as well as a violent incident in Cainhoy at an October joint discussion meeting.\nViolent incidents occurred throughout the Piedmont of the state as white insurgents struggled to impose white supremacy in the face of social changes after the war and the granting of citizenship to freedmen by amendments to the U.S. Constitution. After former Confederates were allowed to vote again, election campaigns from 1872 on were marked by violent intimidation of blacks and Republicans by conservative Democratic paramilitary groups, known as the Red Shirts. Violent incidents occurred in Charleston on King Street on September 6 and nearby Cainhoy on October 15 in association with political meetings before the 1876 election. The Cainhoy incident was the only one statewide in which more whites were killed than blacks. The Red Shirts were instrumental in suppressing the black Republican vote in some areas in 1876 and narrowly electing Wade Hampton as governor, and taking back control of the state legislature. Another riot occurred in Charleston the day after the election when a prominent Republican leader was mistakenly reported killed.\nPolitics.\nIn the early 20th century, strong political machines emerged in the city, reflecting economic, class, racial, and ethnic tensions. The factions nearly all opposed U.S. Senator Ben Tillman who repeatedly attacked and ridiculed the city in the name of upstate poor farmers. Well-organized factions within the Democratic Party in Charleston gave the voters clear choices and played a large role in state politics.\n1886 earthquake.\nOn August 31, 1886, Charleston experienced a strong earthquake. The shock was estimated to have a moment magnitude of 7.0 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of X (\"Extreme\"). It was felt as far away as Boston to the north, Chicago and Milwaukee to the northwest, as far west as New Orleans, as far south as Cuba, and as far east as Bermuda. It damaged 2,000 buildings in Charleston and caused $6 million worth of damage ($ million in 2024 dollars), at a time when all the city's buildings were valued around $24 million ($ million in 2024 dollars).\nCharleston race riots.\nThe Charleston race riot of 1919 took place on the night of Saturday, May 10, between members of the US Navy and the local black population. They attacked black individuals, businesses, and homes, killing six and injuring dozens.\nContemporary era (1945\u2013present).\nCharleston languished economically for several decades in the 20th century, though the large federal military presence in the region helped to shore up the city's economy. Charleston's tourism boom began in earnest following the publication of Albert Simons and Samuel Lapham's \"Architecture of Charleston\" in the 1920s.\nThe Charleston Hospital Strike of 1969, in which mostly black workers protested discrimination and low wages, was one of the last major events of the civil rights movement. It attracted Ralph Abernathy, Coretta Scott King, Andrew Young, and other prominent figures to march with the local leader, Mary Moultrie.\nJoseph P. Riley Jr. was elected mayor in the 1970s and helped advance several cultural aspects of the city.\nBetween 1989 and 1996, Charleston saw two significant economic hits. First, the eye of Hurricane Hugo came ashore at Charleston Harbor in 1989, and though the worst damage was in nearby McClellanville, three-quarters of the homes in Charleston's historic district sustained damage of varying degrees. The hurricane caused over $2.8 billion in damage. The city rebounded fairly quickly after the hurricane and has grown in population, reaching an estimated 124,593 residents in 2009. Second, in 1993, the Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) directed that Naval Base Charleston be closed. Pursuant to BRAC action, Naval Base Charleston was closed on April 1, 1996, although some activities remain under the cognizance of Naval Support Activity Charleston, now part of Joint Base Charleston.\nAfter having been a majority-minority city for most of its history, in the late 20th century, many whites began returning to the urban core of Charleston, and the area gentrified with rising prices and rents. From 1980 to 2010, the peninsula's population shifted from two-thirds black to two-thirds white; in 2010, residents numbered 20,668 whites and 10,455 blacks. Many African Americans moved to the less-expensive suburbs in these decades.\nOn June 17, 2015, 21-year-old white supremacist Dylann Roof entered the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church and sat in on part of a Bible study before shooting and killing nine people and injuring a tenth, all African Americans. Senior pastor Clementa Pinckney, who also served as a state senator, was among those killed during the attack. The deceased also included congregation members Susie Jackson, 87; Rev. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74; Ethel Lance, 70; Myra Thompson, 59; Cynthia Hurd, 54; Rev. Depayne Middleton-Doctor, 49; Rev. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45; and Tywanza Sanders, 26. The attack garnered national attention and sparked a debate on racism, Confederate symbolism in Southern states, and gun violence, in part based on Roof's online postings. A memorial service on the campus of the College of Charleston was attended by President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Jill Biden, and Speaker of the House John Boehner.\nCondemnation of role in the slave trade.\nOn June 17, 2018, the Charleston City Council apologized for its role in the slave trade and condemned its \"inhumane\" history. It also acknowledged wrongs committed against African Americans by slavery and Jim Crow laws.\nGeography.\nThe city proper consists of six distinct districts.\nTopography.\nThe incorporated city fit into as late as World War I, but has since greatly expanded, crossing the Ashley River and encompassing James Island and some of Johns Island. The city limits also have expanded across the Cooper River, encompassing Daniel Island and the Cainhoy area. The present city has a total area of , of which is land and (15.11%) is water. North Charleston blocks any expansion up the peninsula, and Mount Pleasant occupies the land directly east of the Cooper River.\nCharleston Harbor runs about southeast to the Atlantic with an average width of about , surrounded on all sides except its entrance. Sullivan's Island lies to the north of the entrance and Morris Island to the south. The entrance itself is about wide; it was originally only deep but began to be enlarged in the 1870s. The tidal rivers (Wando, Cooper, Stono, and Ashley) are evidence of a submergent or drowned coastline. There is a submerged river delta off the mouth of the harbor, and the Cooper River is deep.\nClimate.\nCharleston has a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\"), with mild winters, hot humid summers, and significant rainfall all year long. Summer is the wettest season; almost half of the annual rainfall occurs from June to September in the form of thundershowers. Fall remains relatively warm through the middle of November. Winter is short and mild and is characterized by occasional rain. Measurable snow (\u2265) has a median occurrence of only once per decade at the airport, but freezing rain is more common; a snowfall/freezing rain event on January 3, 2018, was the first such event in Charleston since December 26, 2010. However, fell at the airport on December 23, 1989, during the December 1989 United States cold wave, the largest single-day fall on record, contributing to a single-storm and seasonal record of snowfall.\nDowntown Charleston's climate is milder than the airport's due to more substantial maritime influence. This is especially true in the winter, with the average January low in downtown being to the airport's for example.\nThe highest temperature recorded within city limits was on June 2, 1985, and June 24, 1944; the lowest was on February 14, 1899, although there was an unofficial record low of in February 1835. At the airport, where official records are kept, the historical range is on August 1, 1999, down to on January 21, 1985. Hurricanes are a major threat to the area during the summer and early fall, with several severe hurricanes hitting the area\u2014most notably Hurricane Hugo on September 21, 1989 (a category 4 storm). The dewpoint from June to August ranges from .\nMetropolitan statistical area.\nAs defined by the Office of Management and Budget, for use by the U.S. Census Bureau and other U.S. Government agencies for statistical purposes only, Charleston is included within the Charleston-North Charleston, SC Metropolitan Statistical Area, which consists of three counties: Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester. The metropolitan statistical area had an estimated population of 849,417 in 2023. North Charleston is the second-largest city in the metro area and ranks as the third-largest city in the state; Mount Pleasant and Summerville are the next-largest cities.\nThe traditional parish system persisted until counties were established during the Reconstruction Era. Nevertheless, traditional parishes still exist in various capacities, mainly as public service districts. When the city of Charleston was formed, it was defined by the limits of the Parish of St. Philip and St. Michael, which now also includes parts of St. James' Parish, St. George's Parish, St. Andrew's Parish, and St. John's Parish. However, the last two are mostly still incorporated rural parishes.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\n2020 census.\nAs of the 2020 census, there were 150,227 people, 58,902 households, and 31,780 families residing in the city.\nIn 2023, of the 150,227 people in Charleston, about 134,996 of them lived in Charleston County, and 15,231 of them lived in Berkeley County.\nLanguage.\nCharleston historically had a large concentration of African Americans who spoke Gullah, a creole language that developed on the Sea Islands and in the Low Country, and local speech patterns were also influenced by this community. Today, Gullah is still spoken by some African-American residents. However, rapid development since 1980, especially on the surrounding Sea Islands, has attracted residents from outside the area and led to a decline in Gullah's prominence.\nThe traditional educated Charleston accent has long been noted throughout the state and South. It is typically heard in wealthy European American older people who trace their families back generations in the city. It has ingliding or monophthongal long mid-vowels, raises \"ay\" and \"aw\" in certain environments, and is nonrhotic. Sylvester Primer of the College of Charleston wrote about aspects of the local dialect in his late 19th-century works: \"Charleston Provincialisms\" (1887) and \"The Huguenot Element in Charleston's Provincialisms\", published in a German journal. He believed the accent was based on English, as the earliest settlers spoke it; therefore, it was derived from Elizabethan England and preserved with modifications by Charleston speakers. The disappearing \"Charleston accent\" spoken mainly by older natives is still noted in the local pronunciation of the city's name. Many Charleston natives ignore the 'r' and elongate the first vowel, pronouncing the name as \"Chalston\".\nReligion.\nCharleston is known as \"the Holy City\". Despite beliefs that the term dates to the city's earliest days and refers to its religiously tolerant culture, the expression was coined in the 20th century, likely as a mockery of Charlestonians' self-satisfied attitude about their city. Many sources, however, traditionally link the term to the many old church spires dotting the skyline of downtown Charleston. Regardless of the nickname's origin, residents have embraced the term and have explained it in more flattering ways.\nThe Anglican church was dominant in the colonial era, and the Cathedral of St. Luke and St. Paul is today the seat of the Anglican Diocese of South Carolina. St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church is another historic church in Charleston. Many French Huguenot refugees settled in Charleston in the early 18th century. The Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church is the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the Southern United States and houses the oldest black congregation south of Baltimore, Maryland.\nSouth Carolina has long allowed Jews to practice their faith without restriction. Kahal Kadosh Beth Elohim, founded in 1749 by Sephardic Jews from London, is the fourth-oldest Jewish congregation in the continental United States and was an important site for the development of Reform Judaism. Brith Sholom Beth Israel is the oldest Orthodox synagogue in the South, founded by Sam Berlin and other Ashkenazi German and Central European Jews in the mid-19th century.\nThe city's oldest Catholic parish, St. Mary of the Annunciation Catholic Church is the mother church of Catholicism in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia. In 1820, Charleston was established as the see city of the Diocese of Charleston, which at the time comprised the Carolinas and Georgia and presently encompasses the state of South Carolina.\nThe Supreme Council of the Scottish Rite, established in Charleston in 1801, is considered the mother council of the world by Scottish Rite Freemasons.\nCulture.\nCharleston's culture blends traditional Southern U.S., English, French, and West African elements. The downtown peninsula has several arts, music, local cuisine, and fashion venues. Spoleto Festival USA, held annually in late spring, was founded in 1977 by Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning composer Gian Carlo Menotti, who sought to establish a counterpart to the \"Festival dei Due Mondi\" (the Festival of Two Worlds) in Spoleto, Italy.\nCharleston's oldest community theater group, the Footlight Players, has provided theatrical productions since 1931. A variety of performing arts venues includes the historic Dock Street Theatre. The annual Charleston Fashion Week held each spring in Marion Square brings in designers, journalists, and clients nationwide. \nCuisine.\nThe cuisine in Charleston is strongly influenced by British, French, and Gullah elements. The city is known for dishes such as shrimp and grits, she-crab soup, fried oysters, Lowcountry boil, deviled crab cakes, and red rice. Local seafood\u2014especially oysters, blue crab, shrimp, flounder, and black sea bass\u2014features prominently due to the region's estuaries and marshes. Gullah Geechee foodways continue to shape Charleston's culinary identity through staples like Carolina Gold rice, okra, field peas, and benne seeds, reflecting the agricultural knowledge brought by enslaved West Africans. In the twenty-first century, Charleston has become a nationally recognized dining destination, with a growing number of award-winning restaurants and chefs contributing to its modern food scene. As of November 2025, Charleston is home to three restaurants awarded one Michelin star.\nAnnual cultural events and fairs.\nCharleston annually hosts Spoleto Festival USA founded by Gian Carlo Menotti, a 17-day art festival featuring over 100 performances by individual artists in various disciplines. The annual Piccolo Spoleto festival takes place at the same time and features local performers and artists, with hundreds of performances throughout the city. Other festivals and events include Historic Charleston Foundation's Festival of Houses and Gardens and Charleston Antiques Show, the Taste of Charleston, The Lowcountry Oyster Festival, the Cooper River Bridge Run, The Charleston Marathon, Southeastern Wildlife Exposition (SEWE), Charleston Food and Wine Festival, Charleston Fashion Week, the MOJA Arts Festival, and the Holiday Festival of Lights (at James Island County Park), and the Charleston International Film Festival. The Charleston Conference is a major library industry event, held in the city center since 1980.\nMusic.\nThe Gullah community has had a tremendous influence on music in Charleston, especially when it comes to the early development of jazz music. In turn, Charleston's music has influenced the rest of the country. The geechee dances that accompanied the music of the dock workers in Charleston followed a rhythm that inspired Eubie Blake's \"Charleston Rag\" and later James P. Johnson's \"Charleston\", as well as the dance craze that defined a nation in the 1920s. \"Ballin' the Jack\", which was a popular dance in the years before \"Charleston\", was written by native Charlestonian Chris Smith.\nThe Jenkins Orphanage was established in 1891 by the Rev. Daniel J. Jenkins in Charleston. The orphanage accepted donations of musical instruments, and Rev. Jenkins hired local Charleston musicians and Avery Institute Graduates to tutor the boys in music. As a result, Charleston musicians became proficient on various instruments and could read music expertly. These traits set Jenkins musicians apart and helped land some of them positions in big bands with Duke Ellington and Count Basie. William \"Cat\" Anderson, Jabbo Smith, and Freddie Green are but a few of the alumni who became professional musicians. Orphanages around the country began to develop brass bands in the wake of the Jenkins Orphanage Band's success.\nAs many as five bands were on tour during the 1920s. The Jenkins Orphanage Band played in the inaugural parades of Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and William Taft and toured the US and Europe. The band also played on Broadway for the play \"Porgy\" by DuBose and Dorothy Heyward, a stage version of their novel of the same title. The story was based in Charleston and featured the Gullah community. The Heywards insisted on hiring the genuine Jenkins Orphanage Band to portray themselves on stage. Only a few years later, DuBose Heyward collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin to turn his novel into the now famous opera, \"Porgy and Bess\" (so named to distinguish it from the play). George Gershwin and Heyward spent the summer of 1934 at Folly Beach outside of Charleston writing this \"folk opera\", as Gershwin called it. \"Porgy and Bess\" is considered one of the first Great American Operas and is widely performed.\nTo this day, Charleston is home to many musicians in all genres. For example, Heyrocco is a local indie band.\nLive theater.\nCharleston has a vibrant theater scene, home to America's first theater. Most of the theaters are part of the League of Charleston Theatres, better known as Theatre Charleston. Some of the city's theaters include:\nMuseums, historical sites, and other attractions.\nCharleston has many historic buildings, art and historical museums, public parks, and other attractions, including:\nSports.\nCharleston is home to some professional, minor league, and amateur sports teams:\nOther notable sports venues in Charleston include Johnson Hagood Stadium (home of The Citadel Bulldogs football team), McAlister Field House (home of The Citadel Bulldogs basketball team), and Toronto Dominion Bank Arena at the College of Charleston, which seats 5,100 people who view the school's basketball and volleyball teams.\nBooks and films.\nVarious books and films have been set in Charleston; some of the best-known works are listed below. In addition, Charleston is a popular filming location for movies and television, both in its own right and as a stand-in for Southern historical settings.\nEconomy.\nCommercial shipping is important to the economy. The city has two shipping terminals, of a total of five terminals owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority in the Charleston metropolitan area, which are part of the fourth-largest container seaport on the East Coast and the seventh-largest container seaport in the United States. The port is also used to transfer cars and car parts for Charleston's auto manufacturing business, such as Mercedes and Volvo.\nSometimes known as Silicon Harbor, the city is becoming a popular location for high tech and innovation, and this sector has had the highest rate of growth between 2011 and 2012, due in large part to the Charleston Digital Corridor. In 2013, the Milken Institute ranked the Charleston region as the ninth-best performing economy in the US because of its growing IT sector. Notable companies include Blackbaud, Greystar Real Estate Partners, Evening Post Industries, Le Creuset, SPARC a Booz Allen Hamilton subsidiary, BoomTown, CSS, and Benefitfocus.\nIn June 2017, the mean sales price for a home in Charleston was $351,186 () and the median price was $260,000 ().\nTop Employers.\nAs of the city's 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the Charleston metropolitan area's top employers are:\nGovernment.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCharleston has a strong mayor\u2013council government, with the mayor acting as the chief administrator and the executive officer of the municipality. The mayor also presides over city council meetings and has a vote, the same as other council members. The current mayor, since 2024, is Republican William S. Cogswell Jr. The council has 12 members who are each elected from single-member districts.\nFire department.\nThe City of Charleston Fire Department consists of over 300 full-time firefighters. These firefighters operate out of 21 companies located throughout the city: 16 engine companies, two tower companies, two ladder companies, a heavy rescue company, a HAZ-MAT unit, and several special units. Training, Fire Marshall, Operations, and Administration are the department's divisions. The department operates on a 24/48 schedule and is a Class 1 ISO rating. Russell (Rusty) Thomas served as Fire Chief until June 2008, and was succeeded by Chief Thomas Carr in November 2008. Chief Daniel Curia presently leads the department.\nPolice department.\nThe City of Charleston Police Department, with 456 sworn officers and 117 civilians is South Carolina's largest police department. Chico Walker serves as the current Chief of Police. He follows Luther Reynolds, Greg Mullen and Reuben Greenberg. Chief Reynolds is credited with continuing successful community outreach programs such as The Illumination Project and fostering a culture of mutual respect. Under Chief Reynolds, the agency has successfully withstood challenges such as the Coronavirus and downtown disturbances. Additionally, the agency continues to recruit police candidates in a competitive market.\nEMS and medical centers.\nEmergency medical services (EMS) for the city are provided by Charleston County Emergency Medical Services (CCEMS) &amp; Berkeley County Emergency Medical Services (BCEMS). The city is served by the EMS and 911 services of both Charleston and Berkeley counties since the city is part of both counties.\nCharleston is the primary medical center for the eastern portion of the state. The city has several major hospitals located in the downtown area: Medical University of South Carolina Medical Center (MUSC), Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center, and Roper Hospital. MUSC is the state's first school of medicine, the largest medical university in the state, and the sixth-oldest continually operating school of medicine in the United States. The downtown medical district is experiencing rapid growth of biotechnology and medical research industries coupled with substantial expansions of all the major hospitals. Additionally, more expansions are planned or underway at another major hospital located in the West Ashley portion of the city: Bon Secours-St Francis Xavier Hospital. The Trident Regional Medical Center located in the City of North Charleston and East Cooper Regional Medical Center located in Mount Pleasant also serve the needs of residents of the city of Charleston.\nCoast Guard Station Charleston.\nCoast Guard Station Charleston responds to search and rescue emergencies, conducts maritime law enforcement activities, and performs ports, waterways, and coastal security (PWCS) missions. Personnel from Station Charleston are highly trained professionals, composed of federal law enforcement officers, boat crew members, and coxswains capable of completing various missions. In 2020, the Coast Guard announced plans to construct a \"superbase\" on the former Charleston Naval Shipyard complex to consolidate all its Charleston-area facilities and become the homeport for five Security cutters and additional offshore cutters. Construction began on the Superbase in 2024.\nCrime.\nThe following table shows Charleston's crime rate for six crimes that Morgan Quitno uses to calculate the ranking of \"America's most dangerous cities\" in comparison to the national average. The statistics shown are for the number of crimes committed per 100,000 people. Since 1999, the overall crime rate in Charleston has declined markedly. Charleston's total crime index rate in 1999 was 597.1 crimes committed per 100,000 people, while in 2011, the total crime index rate was 236.4 per 100,000.\nTransportation.\nAirport and rail.\nThe city of Charleston is served by the Charleston International Airport. It is located in the city of North Charleston and is about northwest of downtown Charleston. It is the busiest passenger airport in South Carolina (). The airport shares runways with the adjacent Charleston Air Force Base. Charleston Executive Airport is a smaller airport located in Charleston's John's Island section and is used by noncommercial aircraft. Both airports are owned and operated by the Charleston County Aviation Authority. As of April 2019, British Airways does seasonal non-stop flights from Charleston to London-Heathrow.\nCharleston is served by two daily Amtrak trains: The Palmetto and Silver Meteor at the Amtrak station, located at 4565 Gaynor Avenue in the city of North Charleston, which is approximately 7.5 miles from downtown Charleston.\nInterstates and highways.\nI-26 begins in Downtown Charleston, with exits to the Septima Clark Expressway, the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge and Meeting Street. Heading northwest, it connects the city to North Charleston, the Charleston International Airport, I-95, and Columbia. The Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge and Septima Clark Expressway are part of US\u00a017, which travels east\u2013west through Charleston and Mount Pleasant. The Mark Clark Expressway, or I-526, is the bypass around the city and begins and ends at US\u00a017. US\u00a052 is Meeting Street and its spur is East Bay Street, which becomes Morrison Drive after leaving the east side. This highway merges with King Street in the city's Neck area (industrial district). US\u00a078 is King Street in the downtown merging with Meeting Street.\nArthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge.\nThe Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge across the Cooper River opened on July 16, 2005, and was the longest cable-stayed bridge in the Americas at the time of its construction. The bridge links downtown Charleston with Mount Pleasant, and has eight lanes plus a 12-foot lane shared by pedestrians and bicycles. The bridge's height varies but is estimated at 573 feet. It replaced the Grace Memorial Bridge (built in 1929) and the Silas N. Pearman Bridge (built in 1966). They were considered two of the more dangerous bridges in America and were demolished after the Ravenel Bridge opened.\nCity bus service.\nThe city is also served by a bus system operated by the Charleston Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA). Most of the urban area is served by regional fixed-route buses equipped with bike racks as part of the system's Rack and Ride program. CARTA offers connectivity to historic downtown attractions and accommodations with the Downtown Area Shuttle trolley buses, and it offers curbside pickup for disabled passengers with its Tel-A-Ride buses. A bus rapid transit system is in development, called Lowcountry Rapid Transit, that will connect Charleston to Summerville through North Charleston.\nRural parts of the city and metropolitan area are served by a different bus system operated by the Berkeley-Charleston-Dorchester Rural Transportation Management Association. The system is also commonly called the TriCounty Link.\nPort.\nThe Port of Charleston, owned and operated by the South Carolina Ports Authority, is one of the largest ports in the United States, ranked seventh in the top 25 by containerized cargo volume in 2018. It consists of six terminals, with the sixth opening in April 2021. Port activity at the two terminals located in the city of Charleston is one of the city's leading sources of revenue, behind tourism.\nToday, the Port of Charleston boasts the deepest water in the southeast region and regularly handles ships too big to transit through the Panama Canal. A harbor-deepening project was completed, which makes the Port of Charleston's entrance channel a depth of and harbor channel 52 feet at mean low tide. With an average high tide of , the depth clearances will become and 58 feet, respectively. At , the Port of Charleston is the deepest harbor on the East Coast.\nPart of Union Pier Terminal in Charleston is a cruise ship passenger terminal hosting numerous cruise departures annually through 2019. Beginning in May 2019, until cruise operations were interrupted in April 2020, the Carnival \"Sunshine\" was permanently stationed in Charleston, offering 4, 5, and 7-day cruises to the Caribbean.\nWith the closure of the Naval Base and the Charleston Naval Shipyard in 1996, Detyens, Inc. signed a long-term lease. Detyens Shipyard, Inc. is one of the East Coast's most extensive commercial marine repair facilities, with three dry docks, one floating dock, and six piers. Projects include military, commercial, and cruise ships.\nEducation.\nBecause most of the city of Charleston is located in Charleston County, it is served by the Charleston County School District, which covers all of Charleston County. Part of the city, however, is served by the Berkeley County School District, which covers all of Berkeley County. This Berkeley County section includes northern portions of the city, such as the Cainhoy Industrial District, Cainhoy Historical District, and Daniel Island.\nCharleston is also served by a large number of independent schools, including Porter-Gaud School (K-12), Charleston Collegiate School (K-12), Ashley Hall (Pre K-12), Charleston Day School (K-8), First Baptist Church School (K-12), Palmetto Christian Academy (K-12), Coastal Christian Preparatory School (K-12), Mason Preparatory School (K-8), and Addlestone Hebrew Academy (K-8).\nThe Roman Catholic Diocese of Charleston Office of Education also operates out of the city and oversees several K-8 parochial schools, such as Blessed Sacrament School, Christ Our King School, Charleston Catholic School, Nativity School, and Divine Redeemer School, all of which are \"feeder\" schools into Bishop England High School, a diocesan high school within the city. Bishop England, Porter-Gaud School, and Ashley Hall are the city's oldest and most prominent private schools and are a significant part of Charleston's history, dating back some 150 years.\nPublic institutions of higher education in Charleston include the College of Charleston, The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, and the Medical University of South Carolina. The city is also home to private schools, including the Charleston Southern University and Charleston School of Law.

Charleston has the only college in the country that offers bachelor's degrees in the building arts, The American College of the Building Arts.\nMedia.\nBroadcast television.\nCharleston is the nation's 89th-largest Designated market area (DMA), with 332,770 households and 0.27% of the U.S. TV population. These stations are licensed in Charleston and have significant operations or viewers in the city:\nSister cities.\nCharleston's sister cities are:\nThe relationship with Spoleto began when Pulitzer Prize-winning Italian composer Gian Carlo Menotti selected Charleston as the city to host the American version of Spoleto's annual Festival of Two Worlds. \"Looking for a city that would provide the charm of Spoleto, as well as its wealth of theaters, churches, and other performance spaces, they selected Charleston, South Carolina, as the ideal location. The historic city provided a perfect fit: intimate enough that the Festival would captivate the entire city, yet cosmopolitan enough to provide an enthusiastic audience and robust infrastructure.\"\nSister city relation with Panama City was described as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;As you may be aware, the city of Charleston, like the city of Panama City, is a historic port City that shares a proud and prosperous history. Our stories are very similar as reflected by our citizens of European, African, Caribbean, native descent, our cuisine, our architecture, and our mutual modern growth in meritime commerce. As Panama City is enjoying a global surge of interest so is Charleston, being ranked as a top destination for travellers, commerce, technology, education, culture and fashion.\u2014\u200a\nCharleston is also twinned with Speightstown. The first colonists to settle in the region designed the original parts of Charlestown based on the plans of Barbados's capital city, Bridgetown.

It is the opposite direction from east and is the direction in which the Sun sets on the Earth.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"west\" is a Germanic word passed into some Romance languages (\"ouest\" in French, \"oest\" in Catalan, \"ovest\" in Italian, \"vest\" in Romanian, \"oeste\" in Spanish and Portuguese). As in other languages, the word formation stems from the fact that west is the direction of the setting sun in the evening: 'west' derives from the Indo-European root \"*wes\" reduced from \"*wes-pero\" 'evening, night', cognate with Ancient Greek \u1f15\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 hesperos 'evening; evening star; western' and Latin vesper 'evening; west'. Examples of the same formation in other languages include Latin occidens 'west' from occid\u014d 'to go down, to set' and Hebrew \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d1 (maarav) 'west' from \u05e2\u05b6\u05e8\u05b6\u05d1 (erev) 'evening'.\nWest is sometimes abbreviated as W.\nNavigation.\nTo go west using a compass for navigation (in a place where magnetic north is the same direction as true north) one needs to set a bearing or azimuth of 270\u00b0.\nWest is the direction opposite that of the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is therefore the general direction towards which the Sun appears to constantly progress and eventually set. This is not true on the planet Venus, which rotates in the opposite direction from the Earth (retrograde rotation). To an observer on the surface of Venus, the Sun would rise in the west and set in the east although Venus's opaque clouds prevent observing the Sun from the planet's surface.\nIn a map with north at the top, west is on the left.\nMoving continuously west is following a circle of latitude.\nWeather.\nDue to the direction of the Earth's rotation, the prevailing wind in many places in the middle latitudes (i.e. between 35 and 65 degrees latitude) is from the west, known as the westerlies.\nCultural.\nThe phrase \"the West\" is often spoken in reference to the Western world, which includes the European Union (also the EFTA countries), the United Kingdom, the Americas, Palestine , Australia, New Zealand and (in part) South Africa.\nThe concept of the Western part of the earth has its roots in the Western Roman Empire and the Western Christianity. During the Cold War \"the West\" was often used to refer to the NATO camp as opposed to the Warsaw Pact and non-aligned nations. The expression survives, with an increasingly ambiguous meaning.\nSymbolic meanings.\nIn Chinese Buddhism, the West represents movement toward the Buddha or enlightenment (see Journey to the West). The ancient Aztecs believed that the West was the realm of the great goddess of water, mist, and maize. In Ancient Egypt, the West was considered to be the portal to the netherworld, and is the cardinal direction regarded in connection with death, though not always with a negative connotation. Ancient Egyptians also believed that the Goddess Amunet was a personification of the West. The Celts believed that beyond the western sea off the edges of all maps lay the Otherworld, or Afterlife.\nIn Judaism, west is seen to be toward the Shekinah (presence) of God, as in Jewish history the Tabernacle and subsequent Jerusalem Temple faced east, with God's Presence in the Holy of Holies up the steps to the west. According to the Bible, the Israelites crossed the Jordan River westward into the Promised Land.\nIn Islam, cardinal directions carry spiritual significance, but the emphasis is often on the omnipresence of God rather than symbolic geography. The West, like all directions, is encompassed by the divine presence. The Qur\u2019an states: \"To God belong the East and the West. Wheresoever you turn, there is the Face of God. God is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.\" (2:115). This verse underscores the idea that spiritual truth transcends direction, offering a contrast to traditions that attach specific symbolic meanings to the West.\nIn American literature (e.g., in \"The Great Gatsby\") moving West has sometimes symbolized gaining freedom, perhaps as an association with the settling of the Wild West (see also the American frontier and Manifest Destiny).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This convention has developed from the use of a compass, which places north at the top. However, on maps of planets such as Venus and Uranus which rotate retrograde, the left hand side is east.\nTo go east using a compass for navigation, one sets a bearing or azimuth of 90\u00b0.\nCultural.\nEast is the direction toward which the Earth rotates about its axis, and therefore the general direction from which the Sun appears to rise. The practice of praying towards the East is older than Christianity, but has been \nadopted by this religion as the Orient was thought of as containing mankind's original home. Hence, Christian churches have been traditionally oriented towards the east. After some early exceptions, this tradition of having the altar on the liturgical east has become a part of the church orientation concept liturgical east and west.\nThe \"Orient\" is the \"East\", traditionally comprising anything that belongs to the Eastern world, in relation to Europe. In English, it is largely a metonym for, and referring to the same area as, the continent of Asia, divided into the Far East, Middle East, and Near East. Despite this Eurocentric origin, these regions are still located to the east of the Geographical centre of Earth.\nOne study has suggested that within an individual Northern Hemisphere city, the east end is typically poorer because the prevailing winds blow from the west.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "61032", "revid": "45454825", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61032", "title": "Rationality", "text": "Quality of being agreeable to reason\nRationality is the quality of being guided by or based on reason. In this regard, a person acts rationally if they have a good reason for what they do, or a belief is rational if it is based on strong evidence. This quality can apply to an ability, as in a rational animal, to a psychological process, like reasoning, to mental states, such as beliefs and intentions, or to persons who possess these other forms of rationality. A thing that lacks rationality is either \"arational\", if it is outside the domain of rational evaluation, or \"irrational\", if it belongs to this domain but does not fulfill its standards.\nThere are many discussions about the essential features shared by all forms, or accounts, of rationality. According to reason-responsiveness accounts, to be rational is to be responsive to reasons. For example, dark clouds are a reason for taking an umbrella, which is why it is rational for an agent to do so in response. An important rival to this approach are coherence-based accounts, which define rationality as internal coherence among the agent's mental states. Many rules of coherence have been suggested in this regard, for example, that one should not hold contradictory beliefs or that one should intend to do something if one believes that one should do it. \nGoal-based accounts characterize rationality in relation to goals, such as acquiring truth in the case of theoretical rationality. Internalists believe that rationality depends only on the person's mind. Externalists contend that external factors may also be relevant. Debates about the normativity of rationality concern the question of whether one should always be rational. A further discussion is whether rationality requires that all beliefs be reviewed from scratch rather than trusting pre-existing beliefs. \nVarious types of rationality are discussed in the academic literature. The most influential distinction is between theoretical and practical rationality. Theoretical rationality concerns the rationality of beliefs. Rational beliefs are based on evidence that supports them. Practical rationality pertains primarily to actions. This includes certain mental states and events preceding actions, like intentions and decisions. In some cases, the two can conflict, as when practical rationality requires that one adopts an irrational belief. Another distinction is between ideal rationality, which demands that rational agents obey all the laws and implications of logic, and bounded rationality, which takes into account that this is not always possible since the computational power of the human mind is too limited. Most academic discussions focus on the rationality of individuals. This contrasts with social or collective rationality, which pertains to collectives and their group beliefs and decisions.\nRationality is important for solving all kinds of problems in order to efficiently reach one's goal. It is relevant to and discussed in many disciplines. In ethics, one question is whether one can be rational without being moral at the same time. Psychology is interested in how psychological processes implement rationality. This also includes the study of failures to do so, as in the case of cognitive biases. Cognitive and behavioral sciences usually assume that people are rational enough to predict how they think and act. Logic studies the laws of correct arguments. These laws are highly relevant to the rationality of beliefs. A very influential conception of practical rationality is given in decision theory, which states that a decision is rational if the chosen option has the highest expected utility. Other relevant fields include game theory, Bayesianism, economics, and artificial intelligence.\nDefinition and semantic field.\nIn its most common sense, rationality is the quality of being guided by reasons or being reasonable. For example, a person who acts rationally has good reasons for what they do. This usually implies that they reflected on the possible consequences of their action and the goal it is supposed to realize. In the case of beliefs, it is rational to believe something if the agent has good evidence for it and it is coherent with the agent's other beliefs. While actions and beliefs are the most paradigmatic forms of rationality, the term is used both in ordinary language and in many academic disciplines to describe a wide variety of things, such as persons, desires, intentions, decisions, policies, and institutions. Because of this variety in different contexts, it has proven difficult to give a unified definition covering all these fields and usages. In this regard, different fields often focus their investigation on one specific conception, type, or aspect of rationality without trying to cover it in its most general sense.\nThese different forms of rationality are sometimes divided into abilities, processes, mental states, and persons. For example, when it is claimed that humans are rational animals, this usually refers to the ability to think and act in reasonable ways. It does not imply that all humans are rational all the time: this ability is exercised in some cases but not in others. On the other hand, the term can also refer to the process of reasoning that results from exercising this ability. Often many additional activities of the higher cognitive faculties are included as well, such as acquiring concepts, judging, deliberating, planning, and deciding as well as the formation of desires and intentions. These processes usually affect some kind of change in the thinker's mental states. In this regard, one can also talk of the rationality of mental states, like beliefs and intentions. A person who possesses these forms of rationality to a sufficiently high degree may themselves be called \"rational\". In some cases, also non-mental results of rational processes may qualify as rational. For example, the arrangement of products in a supermarket can be rational if it is based on a rational plan.\nThe term \"rational\" has two opposites: \"irrational\" and \"arational\". Arational things are outside the domain of rational evaluation, like digestive processes or the weather. Things within the domain of rationality are either rational or irrational depending on whether they fulfill the standards of rationality. For example, beliefs, actions, or general policies are rational if there is a good reason for them and irrational otherwise. It is not clear in all cases what belongs to the domain of rational assessment. For example, there are disagreements about whether desires and emotions can be evaluated as rational and irrational rather than arational. The term \"irrational\" is sometimes used in a wide sense to include cases of arationality.\nThe meaning of the terms \"rational\" and \"irrational\" in academic discourse often differs from how they are used in everyday language. Examples of behaviors considered irrational in ordinary discourse are giving into temptations, going out late even though one has to get up early in the morning, smoking despite being aware of the health risks, or believing in astrology. In the academic discourse, on the other hand, rationality is usually identified with being guided by reasons or following norms of internal coherence. Some of the earlier examples may qualify as rational in the academic sense depending on the circumstances. Examples of irrationality in this sense include cognitive biases and violating the laws of probability theory when assessing the likelihood of future events. This article focuses mainly on irrationality in the academic sense.\nThe terms \"rationality\", \"reason\", and \"reasoning\" are frequently used as synonyms. But in technical contexts, their meanings are often distinguished. Reason is usually understood as the faculty responsible for the process of reasoning. This process aims at improving mental states. Reasoning tries to ensure that the norms of rationality obtain. It differs from rationality nonetheless since other psychological processes besides reasoning may have the same effect. Rationality derives etymologically from the Latin term \"\".\nDisputes about the concept of rationality.\nThere are many disputes about the essential characteristics of rationality. It is often understood in relational terms: something, like a belief or an intention, is rational because of how it is related to something else. But there are disagreements as to what it has to be related to and in what way. For reason-based accounts, the relation to a reason that justifies or explains the rational state is central. For coherence-based accounts, the relation of coherence between mental states matters. There is a lively discussion in the contemporary literature on whether reason-based accounts or coherence-based accounts are superior. Some theorists also try to understand rationality in relation to the goals it tries to realize.\nOther disputes in this field concern whether rationality depends only on the agent's mind or also on external factors, whether rationality requires a review of all one's beliefs from scratch, and whether we should always be rational.\nBased on reason-responsiveness.\nA common idea of many theories of rationality is that it can be defined in terms of reasons. In this view, to be rational means to respond correctly to reasons. For example, the fact that a food is healthy is a reason to eat it. So this reason makes it rational for the agent to eat the food. An important aspect of this interpretation is that it is not sufficient to merely act accidentally in accordance with reasons. Instead, \"responding\" to reasons implies that one acts intentionally because of these reasons.\nSome theorists understand reasons as external facts. This view has been criticized based on the claim that, in order to respond to reasons, people have to be aware of them, i.e. they have some form of epistemic access. But lacking this access is not automatically irrational. In one example by John Broome, the agent eats a fish contaminated with salmonella, which is a strong reason against eating the fish. But since the agent could not have known this fact, eating the fish is rational for them. Because of such problems, many theorists have opted for an internalist version of this account. This means that the agent does not need to respond to reasons in general, but only to reasons they have or possess. The success of such approaches depends a lot on what it means to have a reason and there are various disagreements on this issue. A common approach is to hold that this access is given through the possession of evidence in the form of cognitive mental states, like perceptions and knowledge. A similar version states that \"rationality consists in responding correctly to beliefs about reasons\". So it is rational to bring an umbrella if the agent has strong evidence that it is going to rain. But without this evidence, it would be rational to leave the umbrella at home, even if, unbeknownst to the agent, it is going to rain. These versions avoid the previous objection since rationality no longer requires the agent to respond to external factors of which they could not have been aware.\nA problem faced by all forms of reason-responsiveness theories is that there are usually many reasons relevant and some of them may conflict with each other. So while salmonella contamination is a reason against eating the fish, its good taste and the desire not to offend the host are reasons in favor of eating it. This problem is usually approached by weighing all the different reasons. This way, one does not respond directly to each reason individually but instead to their weighted sum. Cases of conflict are thus solved since one side usually outweighs the other. So despite the reasons cited in favor of eating the fish, the balance of reasons stands against it, since avoiding a salmonella infection is a much weightier reason than the other reasons cited. This can be expressed by stating that rational agents pick the option favored by the balance of reasons.\nHowever, other objections to the reason-responsiveness account are not so easily solved. They often focus on cases where reasons require the agent to be irrational, leading to a rational dilemma. For example, if terrorists threaten to blow up a city unless the agent forms an irrational belief, this is a very weighty reason to do all in one's power to violate the norms of rationality.\nBased on rules of coherence.\nAn influential rival to the reason-responsiveness account understands rationality as internal coherence. On this view, a person is rational to the extent that their mental states and actions are coherent with each other. Diverse versions of this approach exist that differ in how they understand coherence and what rules of coherence they propose. A general distinction in this regard is between negative and positive coherence. Negative coherence is an uncontroversial aspect of most such theories: it requires the absence of contradictions and inconsistencies. This means that the agent's mental states do not clash with each other. In some cases, inconsistencies are rather obvious, as when a person believes that it will rain tomorrow and that it will not rain tomorrow. In complex cases, inconsistencies may be difficult to detect, for example, when a person believes in the axioms of Euclidean geometry and is nonetheless convinced that it is possible to square the circle. Positive coherence refers to the support that different mental states provide for each other. For example, there is positive coherence between the belief that there are eight planets in the Solar System and the belief that there are less than ten planets in the Solar System: the earlier belief implies the latter belief. Other types of support through positive coherence include explanatory and causal connections.\nCoherence-based accounts are also referred to as rule-based accounts since the different aspects of coherence are often expressed in precise rules. In this regard, to be rational means to follow the rules of rationality in thought and action. According to the enkratic rule, for example, rational agents are required to intend what they believe they ought to do. This requires coherence between beliefs and intentions. The norm of persistence states that agents should retain their intentions over time. This way, earlier mental states cohere with later ones. It is also possible to distinguish different types of rationality, such as theoretical or practical rationality, based on the different sets of rules they require.\nOne problem with such coherence-based accounts of rationality is that the norms can enter into conflict with each other, so-called rational dilemmas. For example, if the agent has a pre-existing intention that turns out to conflict with their beliefs, then the enkratic norm requires them to change it, which is disallowed by the norm of persistence. This suggests that, in cases of rational dilemmas, it is impossible to be rational, no matter which norm is privileged. Some defenders of coherence theories of rationality have argued that, when formulated correctly, the norms of rationality cannot enter into conflict with each other. That means that rational dilemmas are impossible. This is sometimes tied to additional non-trivial assumptions, such that ethical dilemmas also do not exist. A different response is to bite the bullet and allow that rational dilemmas exist. This has the consequence that, in such cases, rationality is not possible for the agent and theories of rationality cannot offer guidance to them. These problems are avoided by reason-responsiveness accounts of rationality since they \"allow for rationality despite conflicting reasons but [coherence-based accounts] do not allow for rationality despite conflicting requirements\". Some theorists suggest a weaker criterion of coherence to avoid cases of necessary irrationality: rationality requires not to obey all norms of coherence but to obey as many norms as possible. So in rational dilemmas, agents can still be rational if they violate the minimal number of rational requirements.\nAnother criticism rests on the claim that coherence-based accounts are either redundant or false. On this view, either the rules recommend the same option as the balance of reasons or a different option. If they recommend the same option, they are redundant. If they recommend a different option, they are false since, according to its critics, there is no special value in sticking to rules against the balance of reasons.\nBased on goals.\nA different approach characterizes rationality in relation to the goals it aims to achieve. In this regard, theoretical rationality aims at epistemic goals, like acquiring truth and avoiding falsehood. Practical rationality, on the other hand, aims at non-epistemic goals, like moral, prudential, political, economic, or aesthetic goals. This is usually understood in the sense that rationality follows these goals but does not set them. So rationality may be understood as a \"minister without portfolio\" since it serves goals external to itself. This issue has been the source of an important historical discussion between David Hume and Immanuel Kant. The slogan of Hume's position is that \"reason is the slave of the passions\". This is often understood as the claim that rationality concerns only how to reach a goal but not whether the goal should be pursued at all. So people with perverse or weird goals may still be perfectly rational. This position is opposed by Kant, who argues that rationality requires having the right goals and motives.\nAccording to William Frankena there are four conceptions of rationality based on the goals it tries to achieve. They correspond to egoism, utilitarianism, perfectionism, and intuitionism. According to the egoist perspective, rationality implies looking out for one's own happiness. This contrasts with the utilitarian point of view, which states that rationality entails trying to contribute to everyone's well-being or to the greatest general good. For perfectionism, a certain ideal of perfection, either moral or non-moral, is the goal of rationality. According to the intuitionist perspective, something is rational \"if and only if [it] conforms to self-evident truths, intuited by reason\". These different perspectives diverge a lot concerning the behavior they prescribe. One problem for all of them is that they ignore the role of the evidence or information possessed by the agent. In this regard, it matters for rationality not just whether the agent acts efficiently towards a certain goal but also what information they have and how their actions appear reasonable from this perspective. Richard Brandt responds to this idea by proposing a conception of rationality based on relevant information: \"Rationality is a matter of what would survive scrutiny by all relevant information.\" This implies that the subject repeatedly reflects on all the relevant facts, including formal facts like the laws of logic.\nInternalism and externalism.\nAn important contemporary discussion in the field of rationality is between internalists and externalists. Both sides agree that rationality demands and depends in some sense on reasons. They disagree on what reasons are relevant or how to conceive those reasons. Internalists understand reasons as mental states, for example, as perceptions, beliefs, or desires. In this view, an action may be rational because it is in tune with the agent's beliefs and realizes their desires. Externalists, on the other hand, see reasons as external factors about what is good or right. They state that whether an action is rational also depends on its actual consequences. The difference between the two positions is that internalists affirm and externalists reject the claim that rationality supervenes on the mind. This claim means that it only depends on the person's mind whether they are rational and not on external factors. So for internalism, two persons with the same mental states would both have the same degree of rationality independent of how different their external situation is. Because of this limitation, rationality can diverge from actuality. So if the agent has a lot of misleading evidence, it may be rational for them to turn left even though the actually correct path goes right.\nBernard Williams has criticized externalist conceptions of rationality based on the claim that rationality should help explain what motivates the agent to act. This is easy for internalism but difficult for externalism since external reasons can be independent of the agent's motivation. Externalists have responded to this objection by distinguishing between motivational and normative reasons. Motivational reasons explain why someone acts the way they do while normative reasons explain why someone ought to act in a certain way. Ideally, the two overlap, but they can come apart. For example, liking chocolate cake is a motivational reason for eating it while having high blood pressure is a normative reason for not eating it. The problem of rationality is primarily concerned with normative reasons. This is especially true for various contemporary philosophers who hold that rationality can be reduced to normative reasons. The distinction between motivational and normative reasons is usually accepted, but many theorists have raised doubts that rationality can be identified with normativity. On this view, rationality may sometimes recommend suboptimal actions, for example, because the agent lacks important information or has false information. In this regard, discussions between internalism and externalism overlap with discussions of the normativity of rationality.\nRelativity.\nAn important implication of internalist conceptions is that rationality is relative to the person's perspective or mental states. Whether a belief or an action is rational usually depends on which mental states the person has. So carrying an umbrella for the walk to the supermarket is rational for a person believing that it will rain but irrational for another person who lacks this belief. According to Robert Audi, this can be explained in terms of experience: what is rational depends on the agent's experience. Since different people make different experiences, there are differences in what is rational for them.\nNormativity.\nRationality is normative in the sense that it sets up certain rules or standards of correctness: to be rational is to comply with certain requirements. For example, rationality requires that the agent does not have contradictory beliefs. Many discussions on this issue concern the question of what exactly these standards are. Some theorists characterize the normativity of rationality in the deontological terms of obligations and permissions. Others understand them from an evaluative perspective as good or valuable. A further approach is to talk of rationality based on what is praise- and blameworthy. It is important to distinguish the norms of rationality from other types of norms. For example, some forms of fashion prescribe that men do not wear bell-bottom trousers. Understood in the strongest sense, a norm prescribes what an agent ought to do or what they have most reason to do. The norms of fashion are not norms in this strong sense: that it is unfashionable does not mean that men ought not to wear bell-bottom trousers. \nMost discussions of the normativity of rationality are interested in the strong sense, i.e. whether agents ought always to be rational. This is sometimes termed a substantive account of rationality in contrast to structural accounts. One important argument in favor of the normativity of rationality is based on considerations of praise- and blameworthiness. It states that we usually hold each other responsible for being rational and criticize each other when we fail to do so. This practice indicates that irrationality is some form of fault on the side of the subject that should not be the case. A strong counterexample to this position is due to John Broome, who considers the case of a fish an agent wants to eat. It contains salmonella, which is a decisive reason why the agent ought not to eat it. But the agent is unaware of this fact, which is why it is rational for them to eat the fish. So this would be a case where normativity and rationality come apart. This example can be generalized in the sense that rationality only depends on the reasons accessible to the agent or how things appear to them. What one ought to do, on the other hand, is determined by objectively existing reasons. In the ideal case, rationality and normativity may coincide but they come apart either if the agent lacks access to a reason or if he has a mistaken belief about the presence of a reason. These considerations are summed up in the statement that rationality supervenes only on the agent's mind but normativity does not.\nBut there are also thought experiments in favor of the normativity of rationality. One, due to Frank Jackson, involves a doctor who receives a patient with a mild condition and has to prescribe one out of three drugs: drug A resulting in a partial cure, drug B resulting in a complete cure, or drug C resulting in the patient's death. The doctor's problem is that they cannot tell which of the drugs B and C results in a complete cure and which one in the patient's death. The objectively best case would be for the patient to get drug B, but it would be highly irresponsible for the doctor to prescribe it given the uncertainty about its effects. So the doctor ought to prescribe the less effective drug A, which is also the rational choice. This thought experiment indicates that rationality and normativity coincide since what is rational and what one ought to do depends on the agent's mind after all.\nSome theorists have responded to these thought experiments by distinguishing between normativity and responsibility. On this view, critique of irrational behavior, like the doctor prescribing drug B, involves a negative evaluation of the agent in terms of responsibility but remains silent on normative issues. On a competence-based account, which defines rationality in terms of the competence of responding to reasons, such behavior can be understood as a failure to execute one's competence. But sometimes we are lucky and we succeed in the normative dimension despite failing to perform competently, i.e. rationally, due to being irresponsible. The opposite can also be the case: bad luck may result in failure despite a responsible, competent performance. This explains how rationality and normativity can come apart despite our practice of criticizing irrationality.\nNormative and descriptive theories.\nThe concept of normativity can also be used to distinguish different theories of rationality. Normative theories explore the normative nature of rationality. They are concerned with rules and ideals that govern how the mind should work. Descriptive theories, on the other hand, investigate how the mind actually works. This includes issues like under which circumstances the ideal rules are followed as well as studying the underlying psychological processes responsible for rational thought. Descriptive theories are often investigated in empirical psychology while philosophy tends to focus more on normative issues. This division also reflects how different these two types are investigated.\nDescriptive and normative theorists usually employ different methodologies in their research. Descriptive issues are studied by empirical research. This can take the form of studies that present their participants with a cognitive problem. It is then observed how the participants solve the problem, possibly together with explanations of why they arrived at a specific solution. Normative issues, on the other hand, are usually investigated in similar ways to how the formal sciences conduct their inquiry. In the field of theoretical rationality, for example, it is accepted that deductive reasoning in the form of modus ponens leads to rational beliefs. This claim can be investigated using methods like rational intuition or careful deliberation toward a reflective equilibrium. These forms of investigation can arrive at conclusions about what forms of thought are rational and irrational without depending on empirical evidence.\nAn important question in this field concerns the relation between descriptive and normative approaches to rationality. One difficulty in this regard is that there is in many cases a huge gap between what the norms of ideal rationality prescribe and how people actually reason. Examples of normative systems of rationality are classical logic, probability theory, and decision theory. Actual reasoners often diverge from these standards because of cognitive biases, heuristics, or other mental limitations.\nTraditionally, it was often assumed that actual human reasoning should follow the rules described in normative theories. In this view, any discrepancy is a form of irrationality that should be avoided. However, this usually ignores the human limitations of the mind. Given these limitations, various discrepancies may be necessary (and in this sense \"rational\") to get the most useful results. For example, the ideal rational norms of decision theory demand that the agent should always choose the option with the highest expected value. However, calculating the expected value of each option may take a very long time in complex situations and may not be worth the trouble. This is reflected in the fact that actual reasoners often settle for an option that is good enough without making certain that it is really the best option available. A further difficulty in this regard is Hume's law, which states that one cannot deduce what ought to be based on what is. So just because a certain heuristic or cognitive bias is present in a specific case, it should not be inferred that it should be present. One approach to these problems is to hold that descriptive and normative theories talk about different types of rationality. This way, there is no contradiction between the two and both can be correct in their own field. Similar problems are discussed in so-called naturalized epistemology.\nConservatism and foundationalism.\nRationality is usually understood as conservative in the sense that rational agents do not start from zero but already possess many beliefs and intentions. Reasoning takes place on the background of these pre-existing mental states and tries to improve them. This way, the original beliefs and intentions are privileged: one keeps them unless a reason to doubt them is encountered. Some forms of epistemic foundationalism reject this approach. According to them, the whole system of beliefs is to be justified by self-evident beliefs. Examples of such self-evident beliefs may include immediate experiences as well as simple logical and mathematical axioms.\nAn important difference between conservatism and foundationalism concerns their differing conceptions of the burden of proof. According to conservativism, the burden of proof is always in favor of already established belief: in the absence of new evidence, it is rational to keep the mental states one already has. According to foundationalism, the burden of proof is always in favor of suspending mental states. For example, the agent reflects on their pre-existing belief that the Taj Mahal is in Agra but is unable to access any reason for or against this belief. In this case, conservatives think it is rational to keep this belief while foundationalists reject it as irrational due to the lack of reasons. In this regard, conservatism is much closer to the ordinary conception of rationality. One problem for foundationalism is that very few beliefs, if any, would remain if this approach was carried out meticulously. Another is that enormous mental resources would be required to constantly keep track of all the justificatory relations connecting non-fundamental beliefs to fundamental ones.\nTypes.\nRationality is discussed in a great variety of fields, often in very different terms. While some theorists try to provide a unifying conception expressing the features shared by all forms of rationality, the more common approach is to articulate the different aspects of the individual forms of rationality. The most common distinction is between theoretical and practical rationality. Other classifications include categories for ideal and bounded rationality as well as for individual and social rationality.\nTheoretical and practical.\nThe most influential distinction contrasts theoretical or epistemic rationality with practical rationality. Its theoretical side concerns the rationality of beliefs: whether it is rational to hold a given belief and how certain one should be about it. Practical rationality, on the other hand, is about the rationality of actions, intentions, and decisions. This corresponds to the distinction between theoretical reasoning and practical reasoning: theoretical reasoning tries to assess whether the agent should change their beliefs while practical reasoning tries to assess whether the agent should change their plans and intentions.\nTheoretical.\nTheoretical rationality concerns the rationality of cognitive mental states, in particular, of beliefs. It is common to distinguish between two factors. The first factor is about the fact that good reasons are necessary for a belief to be rational. This is usually understood in terms of evidence provided by the so-called sources of knowledge, i.e. faculties like perception, introspection, and memory. In this regard, it is often argued that to be rational, the believer has to respond to the impressions or reasons presented by these sources. For example, the visual impression of the sunlight on a tree makes it rational to believe that the sun is shining. In this regard, it may also be relevant whether the formed belief is involuntary and implicit \nThe second factor pertains to the norms and procedures of rationality that govern how agents should form beliefs based on this evidence. These norms include the rules of inference discussed in regular logic as well as other norms of coherence between mental states. In the case of rules of inference, the premises of a valid argument offer support to the conclusion and make therefore the belief in the conclusion rational. The support offered by the premises can either be deductive or non-deductive. In both cases, believing in the premises of an argument makes it rational to also believe in its conclusion. The difference between the two is given by how the premises support the conclusion. For deductive reasoning, the premises offer the strongest possible support: it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. The premises of non-deductive arguments also offer support for their conclusion. But this support is not absolute: the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the premises make it more likely that the conclusion is true. In this case, it is usually demanded that the non-deductive support is sufficiently strong if the belief in the conclusion is to be rational. \nAn important form of theoretical irrationality is motivationally biased belief, sometimes referred to as wishful thinking. In this case, beliefs are formed based on one's desires or what is pleasing to imagine without proper evidential support. Faulty reasoning in the form of formal and informal fallacies is another cause of theoretical irrationality.\nPractical.\nAll forms of practical rationality are concerned with how we act. It pertains both to actions directly as well as to mental states and events preceding actions, like intentions and decisions. There are various aspects of practical rationality, such as how to pick a goal to follow and how to choose the means for reaching this goal. Other issues include the coherence between different intentions as well as between beliefs and intentions.\nSome theorists define the rationality of actions in terms of beliefs and desires. In this view, an action to bring about a certain goal is rational if the agent has the desire to bring about this goal and the belief that their action will realize it. A stronger version of this view requires that the responsible beliefs and desires are rational themselves. A very influential conception of the rationality of decisions comes from decision theory. In decisions, the agent is presented with a set of possible courses of action and has to choose one among them. Decision theory holds that the agent should choose the alternative that has the highest expected value. Practical rationality includes the field of actions but not of behavior in general. The difference between the two is that actions are intentional behavior, i.e. they are performed for a purpose and guided by it. In this regard, intentional behavior like driving a car is either rational or irrational while non-intentional behavior like sneezing is outside the domain of rationality.\nFor various other practical phenomena, there is no clear consensus on whether they belong to this domain or not. For example, concerning the rationality of desires, two important theories are proceduralism and substantivism. According to proceduralism, there is an important distinction between instrumental and noninstrumental desires. A desire is instrumental if its fulfillment serves as a means to the fulfillment of another desire. For example, Jack is sick and wants to take medicine to get healthy again. In this case, the desire to take the medicine is instrumental since it only serves as a means to Jack's noninstrumental desire to get healthy. Both proceduralism and substantivism usually agree that a person can be irrational if they lack an instrumental desire despite having the corresponding noninstrumental desire and being aware that it acts as a means. Proceduralists hold that this is the only way a desire can be irrational. Substantivists, on the other hand, allow that noninstrumental desires may also be irrational. In this regard, a substantivist could claim that it would be irrational for Jack to lack his noninstrumental desire to be healthy. Similar debates focus on the rationality of emotions.\nRelation between the two.\nTheoretical and practical rationality are often discussed separately and there are many differences between them. In some cases, they even conflict with each other. However, there are also various ways in which they overlap and depend on each other.\nIt is sometimes claimed that theoretical rationality aims at truth while practical rationality aims at goodness. According to John Searle, the difference can be expressed in terms of \"direction of fit\". On this view, theoretical rationality is about how the mind corresponds to the world by representing it. Practical rationality, on the other hand, is about how the world corresponds to the ideal set up by the mind and how it should be changed. Another difference is that arbitrary choices are sometimes needed for practical rationality. For example, there may be two equally good routes available to reach a goal. On the practical level, one has to choose one of them if one wants to reach the goal. It would even be practically irrational to resist this arbitrary choice, as exemplified by Buridan's ass. But on the theoretical level, one does not have to form a belief about which route was taken upon hearing that someone reached the goal. In this case, the arbitrary choice for one belief rather than the other would be theoretically irrational. Instead, the agent should suspend their belief either way if they lack sufficient reasons. Another difference is that practical rationality is guided by specific goals and desires, in contrast to theoretical rationality. So it is practically rational to take medicine if one has the desire to cure a sickness. But it is theoretically irrational to adopt the belief that one is healthy just because one desires this. This is a form of wishful thinking.\nIn some cases, the demands of practical and theoretical rationality conflict with each other. For example, the practical reason of loyalty to one's child may demand the belief that they are innocent while the evidence linking them to the crime may demand a belief in their guilt on the theoretical level.\nBut the two domains also overlap in certain ways. For example, the norm of rationality known as enkrasia links beliefs and intentions. It states that \"rationality requires of you that you intend to F if you believe your reasons require you to F\". Failing to fulfill this requirement results in cases of irrationality known as akrasia or weakness of the will. Another form of overlap is that the study of the rules governing practical rationality is a theoretical matter. And practical considerations may determine whether to pursue theoretical rationality on a certain issue as well as how much time and resources to invest in the inquiry. It is often held that practical rationality presupposes theoretical rationality. This is based on the idea that to decide what should be done, one needs to know what is the case. But one can assess what is the case independently of knowing what should be done. So in this regard, one can study theoretical rationality as a distinct discipline independent of practical rationality but not the other way round. However, this independence is rejected by some forms of doxastic voluntarism. They hold that theoretical rationality can be understood as one type of practical rationality. This is based on the controversial claim that we can decide what to believe. It can take the form of \"epistemic decision theory\", which states that people try to fulfill epistemic aims when deciding what to believe. A similar idea is defended by Jes\u00fas Moster\u00edn. He argues that the proper object of rationality is not \"belief\" but \"acceptance\". He understands acceptance as a voluntary and context-dependent decision to affirm a proposition.\nIdeal and bounded.\nVarious theories of rationality assume some form of ideal rationality, for example, by demanding that rational agents obey all the laws and implications of logic. This can include the requirement that if the agent believes a proposition, they should also believe in everything that logically follows from this proposition. However, many theorists reject this form of logical omniscience as a requirement for rationality. They argue that, since the human mind is limited, rationality has to be defined accordingly to account for how actual finite humans possess some form of resource-limited rationality.\nAccording to the position of bounded rationality, theories of rationality should take into account cognitive limitations, such as incomplete knowledge, imperfect memory, and limited capacities of computation and representation. An important research question in this field is about how cognitive agents use heuristics rather than brute calculations to solve problems and make decisions. According to the satisficing heuristic, for example, agents usually stop their search for the best option once an option is found that meets their desired achievement level. In this regard, people often do not continue to search for the best possible option, even though this is what theories of ideal rationality commonly demand. Using heuristics can be highly rational as a way to adapt to the limitations of the human mind, especially in complex cases where these limitations make brute calculations impossible or very time- and resource-intensive.\nIndividual and social.\nMost discussions and research in the academic literature focus on individual rationality. This concerns the rationality of individual persons, for example, whether their beliefs and actions are rational. But the question of rationality can also be applied to groups as a whole on the social level. This form of social or collective rationality concerns both theoretical and practical issues like group beliefs and group decisions. And just like in the individual case, it is possible to study these phenomena as well as the processes and structures that are responsible for them. On the social level, there are various forms of cooperation to reach a shared goal. In theoretical cases, a group of jurors may first discuss and then vote to determine whether the defendant is guilty. Or in the practical case, politicians may cooperate to implement new regulations to combat climate change. These forms of cooperation can be judged on their social rationality depending on how they are implemented and on the quality of the results they bear. Some theorists try to reduce social rationality to individual rationality by holding that the group processes are rational to the extent that the individuals participating in them are rational. But such a reduction is frequently rejected.\nVarious studies indicate that group rationality often outperforms individual rationality. For example, groups of people working together on the Wason selection task usually perform better than individuals by themselves. This form of group superiority is sometimes termed \"wisdom of crowds\" and may be explained based on the claim that competent individuals have a stronger impact on the group decision than others. However, this is not always the case and sometimes groups perform worse due to conformity or unwillingness to bring up controversial issues.\nOthers.\nMany other classifications are discussed in the academic literature. One important distinction is between approaches to rationality based on the output or on the process. Process-oriented theories of rationality are common in cognitive psychology and study how cognitive systems process inputs to generate outputs. Output-oriented approaches are more common in philosophy and investigate the rationality of the resulting states. Another distinction is between relative and categorical judgments of rationality. In the relative case, rationality is judged based on limited information or evidence while categorical judgments take all the evidence into account and are thus judgments \"all things considered\". For example, believing that one's investments will multiply can be rational in a relative sense because it is based on one's astrological horoscope. But this belief is irrational in a categorical sense if the belief in astrology is itself irrational.\nImportance.\nRationality is central to solving many problems, both on the local and the global scale. This is often based on the idea that rationality is necessary to act efficiently and to reach all kinds of goals. This includes goals from diverse fields, such as ethical goals, humanist goals, scientific goals, and even religious goals. The study of rationality is very old and has occupied many of the greatest minds since ancient Greek. This interest is often motivated by discovering the potentials and limitations of our minds. Various theorists even see rationality as the essence of being human, often in an attempt to distinguish humans from other animals. However, this strong affirmation has been subjected to many criticisms, for example, that humans are not rational all the time and that non-human animals also show diverse forms of intelligence.\nThe topic of rationality is relevant to a variety of disciplines. It plays a central role in philosophy, psychology, Bayesianism, decision theory, and game theory. But it is also covered in other disciplines, such as artificial intelligence, behavioral economics, microeconomics, and neuroscience. Some forms of research restrict themselves to one specific domain while others investigate the topic in an interdisciplinary manner by drawing insights from different fields. \nParadoxes of rationality.\nThe term \"paradox of rationality\" has a variety of meanings. It is often used for puzzles or unsolved problems of rationality. Some are just situations where it is not clear what the rational person should do. Others involve apparent faults within rationality itself, for example, where rationality seems to recommend a suboptimal course of action. A special case are so-called rational dilemmas, in which it is impossible to be rational since two norms of rationality conflict with each other. Examples of paradoxes of rationality include Pascal's Wager, the Prisoner's dilemma, Buridan's ass, and the St. Petersburg paradox.\nHistory.\nMax Weber.\nThe German scholar Max Weber proposed an interpretation of social action that distinguished between four different idealized types of rationality.\nThe first, which he called \"Zweckrational\" or purposive/instrumental rationality, is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were \"rationally pursued and calculated.\" The second type, Weber called \"Wertrational\" or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motives, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion\u2014to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered \"meaningfully oriented.\" The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.\nThe advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that ground or motive can be given\u2014for religious or affect reasons, for example\u2014that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the \"Zweckrational\" orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are \"Wertrational\".\nWeber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a Habermasian (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power) and also from a feminist perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power. An alternative position on rationality (which includes both bounded rationality, as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988), who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).\nRichard Brandt.\nRichard Brandt proposed a \"reforming definition\" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of cognitive-psychotherapy.\nRobert Audi.\nRobert Audi developed a comprehensive account of rationality that covers both the theoretical and the practical side of rationality. This account centers on the notion of a \"ground\": a mental state is rational if it is \"well-grounded\" in a source of justification. Irrational mental states, on the other hand, lack a sufficient ground. For example, the perceptual experience of a tree when looking outside the window can ground the rationality of the belief that there is a tree outside.\nAudi is committed to a form of foundationalism: the idea that justified beliefs, or in his case, rational states in general, can be divided into two groups: the \"foundation\" and the \"superstructure\". The mental states in the superstructure receive their justification from other rational mental states while the foundational mental states receive their justification from a more basic source. For example, the above-mentioned belief that there is a tree outside is foundational since it is based on a basic source: perception. Knowing that trees grow in soil, we may deduce that there is soil outside. This belief is equally rational, being supported by an adequate ground, but it belongs to the superstructure since its rationality is grounded in the rationality of another belief. Desires, like beliefs, form a hierarchy: intrinsic desires are at the foundation while instrumental desires belong to the superstructure. In order to link the instrumental desire to the intrinsic desire an extra element is needed: a belief that the fulfillment of the instrumental desire is a means to the fulfillment of the intrinsic desire.\nAudi asserts that all the basic sources providing justification for the foundational mental states come from experience. As for \"beliefs\", there are four types of experience that act as sources: perception, memory, introspection, and rational intuition. The main basic source of the rationality of \"desires\", on the other hand, comes in the form of hedonic experience: the experience of pleasure and pain. So, for example, a desire to eat ice-cream is rational if it is based on experiences in which the agent enjoyed the taste of ice-cream, and irrational if it lacks such a support. Because of its dependence on experience, rationality can be defined as a kind of responsiveness to experience.\n\"Actions\", in contrast to beliefs and desires, do not have a source of justification of their own. Their rationality is grounded in the rationality of other states instead: in the rationality of beliefs and desires. Desires motivate actions. Beliefs are needed here, as in the case of instrumental desires, to bridge a gap and link two elements. Audi distinguishes the \"focal\" rationality of individual mental states from the \"global\" rationality of \"persons\". Global rationality has a derivative status: it depends on the focal rationality. Or more precisely: \"Global rationality is reached when a person has a sufficiently integrated system of sufficiently well-grounded propositional attitudes, emotions, and actions\". Rationality is \"relative\" in the sense that it depends on the experience of the person in question. Since different people undergo different experiences, what is rational to believe for one person may be irrational to believe for another person. That a belief is rational does not entail that it is \"true\".\nIn various fields.\nEthics and morality.\nThe problem of rationality is relevant to various issues in ethics and morality. Many debates center around the question of whether rationality implies morality or is possible without it. Some examples based on common sense suggest that the two can come apart. For example, some immoral psychopaths are highly intelligent in the pursuit of their schemes and may, therefore, be seen as rational. However, there are also considerations suggesting that the two are closely related to each other. For example, according to the principle of universality, \"one's reasons for acting are acceptable only if it is acceptable that everyone acts on such reasons\". A similar formulation is given in Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative: \"act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law\". The principle of universality has been suggested as a basic principle both for morality and for rationality. This is closely related to the question of whether agents have a duty to be rational. Another issue concerns the value of rationality. In this regard, it is often held that human lives are more important than animal lives because humans are rational.\nPsychology.\nMany psychological theories have been proposed to describe how reasoning happens and what underlying psychological processes are responsible. One of their goals is to explain how the different types of irrationality happen and why some types are more prevalent than others. They include \"mental logic theories\", \"mental model theories\", and \"dual process theories\". An important psychological area of study focuses on cognitive biases. Cognitive biases are systematic tendencies to engage in erroneous or irrational forms of thinking, judging, and acting. Examples include the confirmation bias, the self-serving bias, the hindsight bias, and the Dunning\u2013Kruger effect. Some empirical findings suggest that metacognition is an important aspect of rationality. The idea behind this claim is that reasoning is carried out more efficiently and reliably if the responsible thought processes are properly controlled and monitored.\nThe Wason selection task is an influential test for studying rationality and reasoning abilities. In it, four cards are placed before the participants. Each has a number on one side and a letter on the opposite side. In one case, the visible sides of the four cards are A, D, 4, and 7. The participant is then asked which cards need to be turned around in order to verify the conditional claim \"if there is a vowel on one side of the card, then there is an even number on the other side of the card\". The correct answer is A and 7. But this answer is only given by about 10%. Many choose card 4 instead even though there is no requirement on what letters may appear on its opposite side. An important insight from using these and similar tests is that the rational ability of the participants is usually significantly better for concrete and realistic cases than for abstract or implausible cases. Various contemporary studies in this field use Bayesian probability theory to study subjective degrees of belief, for example, how the believer's certainty in the premises is carried over to the conclusion through reasoning.\nIn the psychology of reasoning, psychologists and cognitive scientists have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to Philip Johnson-Laird and Ruth M.\u00a0J. Byrne among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors. However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the conjunction fallacy, on the Wason selection task, or the base rate fallacy suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as Gerd Gigerenzer, favor a conception of bounded rationality, especially for tasks under high uncertainty. The concept of rationality continues to be debated by psychologists, economists and cognitive scientists.\nThe psychologist Jean Piaget gave an influential account of how the stages in human development from childhood to adulthood can be understood in terms of the increase of rational and logical abilities. He identifies four stages associated with rough age groups: the sensorimotor stage below the age of two, the preoperational state until the age of seven, the concrete operational stage until the age of eleven, and the formal operational stage afterward. Rational or logical reasoning only takes place in the last stage and is related to abstract thinking, concept formation, reasoning, planning, and problem-solving.\nEmotions.\nAccording to A. C. Grayling, rationality \"must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts\". Certain findings in cognitive science and neuroscience show that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example, an individual with a massively damaged amygdala or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. In his book, \"The Edge of Reason: A Rational Skeptic in an Irrational World,\" British philosopher Julian Baggini sets out to debunk myths about reason (e.g., that it is \"purely objective and requires no subjective judgment\").\nCognitive and behavioral sciences.\nCognitive and behavioral sciences try to describe, explain, and predict how people think and act. Their models are often based on the assumption that people are rational. For example, classical economics is based on the assumption that people are rational agents that maximize expected utility. However, people often depart from the ideal standards of rationality in various ways. For example, they may only look for confirming evidence and ignore disconfirming evidence. Another factor studied in this regard are the limitations of human intellectual capacities. Many discrepancies from rationality are caused by limited time, memory, or attention. Often heuristics and rules of thumb are used to mitigate these limitations, but they may lead to new forms of irrationality.\nLogic.\nTheoretical rationality is closely related to logic, but not identical to it. Logic is often defined as the study of correct arguments. This concerns the relation between the propositions used in the argument: whether its premises offer support to its conclusion. Theoretical rationality, on the other hand, is about what to believe or how to change one's beliefs. The laws of logic are relevant to rationality since the agent should change their beliefs if they violate these laws. But logic is not directly about what to believe. Additionally, there are also other factors and norms besides logic that determine whether it is rational to hold or change a belief. The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.\nDecision theory.\nAn influential account of practical rationality is given by decision theory. Decisions are situations where a number of possible courses of action are available to the agent, who has to choose one of them. Decision theory investigates the rules governing which action should be chosen. It assumes that each action may lead to a variety of outcomes. Each outcome is associated with a conditional probability and a utility. The \"expected gain\" of an outcome can be calculated by multiplying its conditional probability with its utility. The \"expected utility\" of an act is equivalent to the sum of all expected gains of the outcomes associated with it. From these basic ingredients, it is possible to define the rationality of decisions: a decision is rational if it selects the act with the highest expected utility. While decision theory gives a very precise formal treatment of this issue, it leaves open the empirical problem of how to assign utilities and probabilities. So decision theory can still lead to bad empirical decisions if it is based on poor assignments.\nAccording to decision theorists, rationality is primarily a matter of internal consistency. This means that a person's mental states like beliefs and preferences are consistent with each other or do not go against each other. One consequence of this position is that people with obviously false beliefs or perverse preferences may still count as rational if these mental states are consistent with their other mental states. Utility is often understood in terms of self-interest or personal preferences. However, this is not a necessary aspect of decisions theory and it can also be interpreted in terms of goodness or value in general.\nGame theory.\nGame theory is closely related to decision theory and the problem of rational choice. Rational choice is based on the idea that rational agents perform a cost-benefit analysis of all available options and choose the option that is most beneficial from their point of view. In the case of game theory, several agents are involved. This further complicates the situation since whether a given option is the best choice for one agent may depend on choices made by other agents. Game theory can be used to analyze various situations, like playing chess, firms competing for business, or animals fighting over prey. Rationality is a core assumption of game theory: it is assumed that each player chooses rationally based on what is most beneficial from their point of view. This way, the agent may be able to anticipate how others choose and what their best choice is relative to the behavior of the others. This often results in a Nash equilibrium, which constitutes a set of strategies, one for each player, where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\nBayesianism.\nA popular contemporary approach to rationality is based on Bayesian epistemology. Bayesian epistemology sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in degrees. For example, Daniel is relatively sure that the Boston Celtics will win their next match and absolutely certain that two plus two equals four. In this case, the degree of the first belief is weaker than the degree of the second belief. These degrees are usually referred to as \"credences\" and represented by numbers between 0 and 1, where 0 corresponds to full disbelief, 1 corresponds to full belief and 0.5 corresponds to suspension of belief. Bayesians understand this in terms of probability: the higher the credence, the higher the subjective probability that the believed proposition is true. As probabilities, they are subject to the laws of probability theory. These laws act as norms of rationality: beliefs are rational if they comply with them and irrational if they violate them. For example, it would be irrational to have a credence of 0.9 that it will rain tomorrow together with another credence of 0.9 that it will not rain tomorrow. This account of rationality can also be extended to the practical domain by requiring that agents maximize their subjective expected utility. This way, Bayesianism can provide a unified account of both theoretical and practical rationality.\nEconomics.\nRationality plays a key role in economics and there are several strands to this. Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality\u2014basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational\u2014that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on the accuracy of beliefs and full use of information\u2014in this view, a person who is not rational has beliefs that do not fully use the information they have.\nDebates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are \"really\" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of bounded rationality makes more sense for such models.\nOthers think that any kind of rationality along the lines of rational choice theory is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term \"homo economicus\" (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is logically consistent but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view. Behavioral economics aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.\nArtificial intelligence.\nThe field of artificial intelligence is concerned, among other things, with how problems of rationality can be implemented and solved by computers. Within artificial intelligence, a \"rational agent\" is typically one that maximizes its expected utility, given its current knowledge. Utility is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of \"performance\", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the psychology of reasoning.\nInternational relations.\nThere is an ongoing debate over the merits of using \"rationality\" in the study of international relations (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable. Others are more critical. Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of \"rationality\" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. \"Rationality\" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to \"foreign policy\" allude to \"rationality\"\u2014and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on \"malpractice\": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of \"rationality\" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between \"us and them.\"\nCriticism.\nThe concept of rationality has been subject to criticism by various philosophers who question its universality and capacity to provide a comprehensive understanding of reality and human existence.\nFriedrich Nietzsche, in his work \"Beyond Good and Evil\" (1886), criticized the overemphasis on rationality and argued that it neglects the irrational and instinctual aspects of human nature. Nietzsche advocated for a reevaluation of values based on individual perspectives and the will to power, stating, \"There are no facts, only interpretations.\"\nMartin Heidegger, in \"Being and Time\" (1927), offered a critique of the instrumental and calculative view of reason, emphasizing the primacy of our everyday practical engagement with the world. Heidegger challenged the notion that rationality alone is the sole arbiter of truth and understanding.\nMax Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno, in their seminal work \"Dialectic of Enlightenment\" (1947), questioned the Enlightenment's rationality. They argued that the dominance of instrumental reason in modern society leads to the domination of nature and the dehumanization of individuals. Horkheimer and Adorno highlighted how rationality narrows the scope of human experience and hinders critical thinking.\nMichel Foucault, in \"Discipline and Punish\" (1975) and \"The Birth of Biopolitics\" (1978), critiqued the notion of rationality as a neutral and objective force. Foucault emphasized the intertwining of rationality with power structures and its role in social control. He famously stated, \"Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategic situation in a particular society.\"\nThese philosophers' critiques of rationality shed light on its limitations, assumptions, and potential dangers. Their ideas challenge the universal application of rationality as the sole framework for understanding the complexities of human existence and the world.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

{"id": "61040", "revid": "37371155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61040", "title": "Jim Rome", "text": "American broadcaster (born 1964)\nJames Phillip Rome (born October 14, 1964) is an American sports radio host. His talk show, \"The Jim Rome Show\", is syndicated by Westwood One. Broadcasting from a studio near Los Angeles, Rome hosts \"The Jim Rome Show\" on radio. He hosted TV shows on ESPN, TSN2 (in Canada), Showtime and CBS, but since 2024 has streamed on X. He has also formed a free, ad supported streaming channel.\nFor a number of years Rome hosted a television show \"Jim Rome Is Burning\" (formerly \"Rome Is Burning\"), which aired on ESPN in the United States and TSN2 in Canada. In 2011, Rome ended his relationship with ESPN to join the CBS network where he hosts his own show, as well as an interview-format show on the Showtime channel. His past hosting jobs included sports discussion television shows \"Talk2\" (ESPN2), \"The FX Sports Show\" (FX), and \"The Last Word\" (Fox Sports Net). The Jim Rome Show is tied for the #21 most listened to talk radio show in the U.S. and Rome is the No. 29 most influential talk radio personality according to \"Talkers Magazine\".\nFrom April 2012 to March 2015, Rome had a television sports talk show on CBS Sports Network named \"Rome\". During the same time period he had a monthly TV sports/entertainment talk show on Showtime named \"Jim Rome on Showtime\".\nPersonal life.\nRome was born in Los Angeles and graduated from Calabasas High School in Calabasas, California in 1982. He earned a degree in communications from the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) in 1987. He and his wife, Janet live in Irvine, California with their two sons, Jake and Logan.\nBroadcasting career.\nRome started his radio career at college radio station KCSB-FM while at UCSB, where he was sports director for one quarter, and at news station KTMS, also in Santa Barbara, where he began as a traffic reporter and became a sports talk host in summer 1987. At the end of 1990, he moved to XTRA Sports 690 in San Diego, where he began what is known as \"The Jim Rome Show\", or \"The Jungle\". A loop of the instrumental intro of Iggy Pop's song \"Lust for Life\" and the instrumental intro of Guns N' Roses' song \"Welcome to the Jungle\" are the show's signature music and have been since 1990.\nThe show's production moved to a studio in downtown Los Angeles in spring 1994, although the broadcast came from XTRA San Diego. At the same time that the studio moved, the show start time shifted to 9am Pacific/12pm Eastern staying there for the rest of 2024. The program was syndicated in 1996 through Premiere Radio Networks, which sold it to an assortment of local stations including ESPN Radio affiliates. A new contract took effect in January 2013 bringing the program to the CBS Sports Radio network, which simulcasted the program on its local FM/AM stations, its SiriusXM satellite channel (now known as Infinity Sports), and its cable TV channel. As of February 2024 the television version of the program was dropped by CBS Sports. The video feed is now marketed as a co-production with X and is also available on various other streaming services.\nBeginning with the first new show of 2025 in January, the show moved to the 3-6 pm Eastern/12-3 pm Pacific time slot. Many local stations and the Infinity Sports channel on Sirius chose to retain their pre-existing shows in that slot and no longer carry the Rome show, which is available only on https:// and seeks listeners on its streaming platforms instead.\nOver time, the show's production facility moved to the Premiere Radio building in Sherman Oaks, an area in Los Angeles, then an undisclosed Orange County location, and finally as part of the start of TV simulcasting in January 2018, a custom-built studio in Costa Mesa, California. Due to past incidents of overzealous fans trespassing at the studio, the exact addresses of the former and current Orange County studios are not publicized. To provide continuity across the show's eras in San Diego , Los Angeles, and Orange County, it is consistently referred to as originating from \"Southern California.\" In 2005, the TV versions of the show were criticized for obscuring the studio's location by using the \"Southern California\" terminology and footage of the downtown Los Angeles skyline despite being broadcast from almost 40 miles away in the Costa Mesa area. The radio show was formerly heard on more than 200 stations across the U.S. and Canada and had an audience of about 2.5 million. In 1998, Rome released an album entitled \"Welcome to the Jungle\", which featured memorable sound bites and music from the show.\nIn early 2003, Rome was interviewing friend Mark Shapiro, executive producer of programming and production at ESPN, on his radio program. Unexpectedly, the two began to discuss a possible return of Rome to ESPN and within a few months, Rome was officially rehired to host \"Rome Is Burning.\" Rome openly attributes the interview as being the impetus to his return to television.\nControversy and incidents.\nRome gained notoriety in 1994 for an incident on his ESPN2 television show, \"Talk2\", when his guest was NFL quarterback Jim Everett (at the time Everett was with the New Orleans Saints). Rome had often referred to Everett on radio as \"Chris\" (after Chris Evert, the female tennis player), suggesting that Everett was less than a man whenever he shied away from getting hit by the defense. Everett appeared as a guest on the television show, where he warned Rome about repeating the insult. Rome continued to address Everett as \"Chris\" and Everett overturned the table between them and shoved Rome to the floor while still on the air. Their confrontation resulted in no legal action and Rome publicly apologized to Everett. Rome considers the event as one of his mistakes early in his career.\nIn 1997, hockey legend Gordie Howe announced an attempt to play a shift with the International Hockey League's Detroit Vipers, which would allow Howe to claim he has played professional hockey in six decades. Rome challenged the star, who was 69, offering a bounty of $3,000 to any player on the team playing against the Vipers to take Howe out of the game permanently by saying, \"Drop gloves with Howe and pummel this old fool back to reality.\" The bounty (which reached at least $5,071 would be given to anyone landing a punch on Howe). Rome clarified the statements were a joke.\nIn 2012, Rome was involved in a controversy with NBA Commissioner David Stern. During an interview, Rome asked Stern about the conspiracy theories that the NBA draft lottery was fixed in favor of the New Orleans Hornets. Rome said, \"Was the fix in for the lottery?\" Stern replied with two answers: \"Number one, no; and a statement, shame on you for asking.\" He proceeded to ask Rome the loaded question, \"Have you stopped beating your wife yet?\" Stern intended to suggest that the subject has been asked a question he can not answer without incriminating himself. He was saying he felt Rome was being unfair.\nOn January 1, 2015, Rome sent out a tweet, \"Is... anyone not in a marching band who thinks those dorks running around with their instruments are cool?\" After backlash, he deleted the tweet and apologized. The incident inspired the hashtag \"#MarchOnRome\".\nCelebrity appearances.\nRome made cameo appearances in the movies \"Space Jam\", \"Two for the Money\", and the 2005 remake of \"The Longest Yard\". He appeared in Blink-182's music video \"What's My Age Again?\" and appeared on the HBO sitcom \"Arliss\". Rome was parodied in the South Park episode \"Sarcastaball\" and the Jim Everett altercation was spoofed in the episode \"The F Word\".\nOn May 3, 2004, Rome hosted Pat Tillman's memorial service. On January 28, 2006, Rome was elected to the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Beverly Hills, California. \"Any Given Sunday,\" an Oliver Stone film, features John C. McGinley playing a brash sportscaster \"Jack Rose,\" a character based on Rome.\nHorse racing.\nAfter poking fun at horse racing for years saying \"it's not a sport, it's a bet,\" Rome seemed to take greater interest in horse racing after interviewing Hall of Fame jockey Kent Desormeaux many times on his show. Rome then took up a stronger interest in buying thoroughbreds. He first was a part owner of Wing Forward, who in his North American debut, made a dramatic last-to-first comeback to win the race. \nRome mentioned it being \"one of the most amazing experiences I've ever had.\" In 2008, Jim and his wife Janet purchased a stake in a two-year-old colt, giving them a potential shot at the Triple Crown stakes races in 2009. Listeners suggested names for the horse, who eventually was named Gallatin's Run. \nBy 2012, Jim Rome owned part or all of 14 horses in connection with multiple partnerships including his own stable, Jungle Racing, LLC. The first to gain national attention was the winner of the 2012 and 2013 Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint, a filly named Mizdirection. Rome's feelings after winning the Breeder's Cup race: \u201cI\u2019ve just had a moment I\u2019ve never experienced in my life. That was absolutely awesome.\u201d He purchased an interest in her for $50,000 in 2010. He co-owned the mare with Bill Strauss, Danny Gohs, Borris Beljak, and Kevin Nish. , Mizdirection won 11 of 17 starts and retired from racing with $1,719,621 in earnings. She was usually ridden by jockey Mike Smith. Two days after her 2014 Breeders' Cup win, Mizdirection was purchased for $2.7 million at the Fasig-Tipton sale by Al Shaqab Racing of Qatar, then owned by Sheikh Joaan Al Thani, and retired to become a broodmare.\nRome's next significant race horse was Shared Belief, a gelding by Candy Ride, named the Eclipse Award winner in the two-year-old male division for 2013. As a three-year-old, he continued winning and closed out the 2014 year with a record of eight wins in nine races (five of six races in 2014 alone). He earned over $2 million in earnings, again with Mike Smith as his regular rider. As a four-year-old, the horse defeated 2014 Kentucky Derby winner and horse of the year California Chrome in both horses' first race of the season, then Shared Belief had a decisive win in the Santa Anita Handicap.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61041", "revid": "2300502", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61041", "title": "Music of Poland", "text": " \nThe music of Poland covers diverse aspects of music and musical traditions which have originated, and are practiced in Poland. Artists from Poland include world-famous classical composers like Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, Karol Szymanowski, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Henryk G\u00f3recki and Krzysztof Penderecki; renowned pianists like Karl Tausig, Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Arthur Rubinstein and Krystian Zimerman; as well as popular music artists, and traditional, regionalised folk music ensembles that create a rich and lively music scene at the grassroots level. The musicians of Poland, over the course of history, have developed and popularized a variety of music genres and folk dances such as mazurka, polonaise, krakowiak, kujawiak, polska partner dance, oberek; as well as the sung poetry genre (\"poezja \u015bpiewana\") and others. Mazurek (Mazur), Krakowiak, Kujawiak, Oberek and Polonaise (Polonez) are registered as Polish National Dances, originating in early Middle Ages. The oldest of them is Polonaise that comes from the Medieval pageant dances and it was originally called \"chodzony\", a \"walking dance\".\nPolish music exhibits influences from a broad variety of styles which are represented by critically acclaimed bands, such as Perfect (Zbigniew Ho\u0142dys), Status Qwo, Maanam (Kora), T.Love, Golec uOrkiestra, Budka Suflera, Czerwone Gitary, D\u017cem, Big Cyc, as well as many other renowned artists, e.g. Czes\u0142aw Niemen, Magdalena Ostrowska, Jacek Kaczmarski, Wojciech M\u0142ynarski, Czes\u0142aw Mozil, Jakob W\u0119giel, Marek Grechuta, and contemporary singer-songwriters and pop icons including Margaret, Maria Peszek, Myslovitz, Edyta Bartosiewicz, and Doda; jazz musicians Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, Krzysztof Komeda, W\u0142odek Pawlik, Adam Makowicz, Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer, and Micha\u0142 Urbaniak; death and black metal music bands Behemoth, Vader, and Decapitated; and film and contemporary classical music composers Wojciech Kilar, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Zbigniew Preisner, Abel Korzeniowski, Krzesimir D\u0119bski, and Krzysztof Meyer, among many others.\nClassical music.\nMedieval and Renaissance.\nThe origin of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century, from which manuscripts have been found in Stary S\u0105cz, containing polyphonic compositions related to the Parisian Notre Dame School. Other early compositions, such as the melody of \"Bogurodzica\", may also date back to this period. The first known notable composer, Miko\u0142aj z Radomia (Nicholas of Radom), lived in the 15th century.\nDuring the 16th century, mostly two musical ensembles \u2013 both based in Krak\u00f3w and belonging to the King and the Archbishop of Wawel \u2013 led the rapid innovation of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include Wac\u0142aw z Szamotu\u0142, Miko\u0142aj Ziele\u0144ski, Nicolaus Cracoviensis, Marcin Leopolita and Miko\u0142aj Gom\u00f3\u0142ka, who composed \"Melodies to Polish Psalter\". Diomedes Cato, a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.\nBaroque.\nDuring the 17th century, Polish composers from this period focused on baroque religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and basso continuo, a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The most renowned composer of this period is Adam Jarz\u0119bski, known for his instrumental works such as \"Chromatica\", \"Tamburetta\", \"Sentinella\", \"Bentrovata\", and \"Nova Casa\". Other composers include Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki, Franciszek Lilius, Bart\u0142omiej P\u0119kiel, Stanis\u0142aw Sylwester Szarzy\u0144ski and Marcin Mielczewski. Also, in the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of Sigismund III and W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV. These included Luca Marenzio, Giovanni Francesco Anerio, and Marco Scacchi.\nIn addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of \"Galatea\" (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy. Shortly after this performance, the court produced Francesca Caccini's opera \"La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d'Alcina\", which she had written for Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw three years earlier when he was in Italy. Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When W\u0142adys\u0142aw was king (as W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known: they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W\u0142adys\u0142aw.\nComposers of the latter part of the 18th century included Maciej Radziwill, whose style has been characterized as being in the galant style.\nClassical.\nFeliks Janiewicz, Karol Kurpi\u0144ski, Jan Stefani, Wojciech \u017bywny and Franciszek \u015acigalski were Polish composers writing in the classical period style characteristic in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The first national opera, \"\" written by Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski and Jan Stefani premiered on 1 March 1794.\nRomantic.\nAt the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the Polonaise and Mazurka \u2014 perhaps the first distinctively Polish art music. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by Jacek Szczurowski, Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski, Juliusz Zar\u0119bski, Henryk Wieniawski, J\u00f3zef Elsner, and, most famously, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including mazurkas, nocturnes, waltzes and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces. The same period saw Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko, the leading individual in the successful development of Polish opera, still renowned for operas like \"Halka\" and \"The Haunted Manor\".\nIn the 19th century the most popular composers were Maria Agata Szymanowska, Franciszek Lessel, and Ignacy Feliks Dobrzy\u0144ski. Important opera composers were Karol Kurpi\u0144ski and Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most prominent composers were W\u0142adys\u0142aw \u017bele\u0144ski and Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz. Karol Szymanowski gained prominence prior to World War II. J\u00f3zef Koffler was the first Polish twelve-tone composer (dodecaphonist).\nContemporary.\nBetween the wars, a group of new and emerging composers formed the Association of Young Polish Musicians; which included future luminaries Gra\u017cyna Bacewicz, Zygmunt Mycielski, Micha\u0142 Spisak and Tadeusz Szeligowski.\nFollowing World War II and the country becoming a communist system, some composers, such as Roman Palester and Andrzej Panufnik, fled the country and remained in exile. In the early 1960s, a number of Polish composers formed the Polish Composers' School, characterized by the use of sonorism and dodecaphonism. The style emerged from the political crisis in 1956, following Stalin's death. In the same year the Warsaw Autumn music festival was inaugurated, both closely connected. According to conductor Antoni Wit composers were given artistic freedom because the Polish regime wasn't as harsh as other Eastern European dictatorships and music wasn't considered ideologically relevant unlike literature, theater or cinema. Composers from the \"Polish School\" included Tadeusz Baird, Bogus\u0142aw Schaeffer, W\u0142odzimierz Koto\u0144ski, Witold Szalonek, Krzysztof Penderecki, Witold Lutos\u0142awski, Wojciech Kilar, Kazimierz Serocki, Tomasz Sikorski, Zygmunt Krauze and Henryk Miko\u0142aj G\u00f3recki.\nMore modern classical and jazz composers include Krzysztof Meyer, Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, Pawe\u0142 Szyma\u0144ski, Krzesimir D\u0119bski, Hanna Kulenty, Eugeniusz Knapik, Pawe\u0142 \u0141ukaszewski, Pawe\u0142 Mykietyn, Maciej Zieli\u0144ski, Marcel Chyrzy\u0144ski, Marta Ptaszynska and Agata Zubel.\nRecordings.\nThe Polskie Nagrania Muza was the state recording company, from 1956. Following the fall of communism it was bought by Warner Music Poland. It dealt with the wide range of music tastes, folk, popular, classical and children's music.\nTraditional folk music.\nPolish folk music was collected in the 19th century by Oskar Kolberg, as part of a wave of Polish national revival. After World War II, in the Polish People's Republic, folk traditions were commonly cultivated, but public performances and broadcasts had also highly organized and officially promoted forms. State-supported, large-scale folk ensembles became prominent. The most famous of these were Mazowsze and \u015al\u0105sk, both of which still perform. Though such bands presented interpretations of regional folk repertoire, the overall sound was a homogenized mixture of Polish styles. There were more authentic groups, such as S\u0142owianki, but the sanitized image of folk music made the whole field unattractive to some audiences, and many traditions dwindled rapidly.\nPolish dance music, especially the mazurka and polonaise, were popularized by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, and they soon spread across Europe and elsewhere. These are triple time dances, while five-beat forms are more common in the northeast and duple-time dances like the krakowiak come from the south. The 'polonaise' comes from the French word for 'Polish' used to identify its origin among the Polish aristocracy who had adapted the dance from a slower walking dance called \"chodzony\". The polonaise then re-entered the lower-class musical life, and became an integral part of the Polish music.\nPodhale.\nWhile folk music lost popularity in Poland, especially in urban areas, the tourist destination of Podhale has retained its lively traditions. The regional capital, Zakopane, has been a center for art since the late 19th century, when people like composer Karol Szymanowski, who discovered Goral folk music there, made the area chic among Europe's intellectuals. Though a part of Poland, Podhale's musical life is more closely related to that found in the Carpathian mountains of Ukraine, Slovakia, Moravia in Czech Republic and Romania.\nLocal ensembles use string instruments like violins and a cello to play distinctive scales with augumented fourth, mainly the lydian mode and acoustic scale, in Poland called \"skala podhala\u0144ska\". The distinctive singing style used in this scale is called \"lidyzowanie\". The lead violin (\"prym\") are accompanied by several second violins (\"sekund\") and a three-stringed cello (\"basy\"). Duple-time dances like the \"krzesany\", \"zb\u00f3jnicki\" (the Brigand's Dance) and \"ozwodna\" are popular. The ozwodna has a five-bar melodic structure which is quite unusual. The krzesany is an extremely swift dance, while the zb\u00f3jnicki is well-known and is perceived as being most \"typical\" of Podhale and Northern Slovakia. Folk songs typically focus on heroes like Juraj J\u00e1no\u0161\u00edk.\nOther regions.\nOutside of Podhale, few regions have active folk scenes, though there are music festivals, such as the Kazimierz Festival, which are well-known and popular. Regional folk bands include Gienek Wilczek Band (Bukowina), Tadeusz Jedynak Band (Przystalowice Male), Stachy Band (Hazc\u00f3w nad Wislokiem), Franciszek Gola Band (Kadzid\u0142o), Edward Markocki Band (Zmysl\u00f3wka-Podlesie), Kazimierz Kantor Band (G\u0142owaczowa), Swarni Band (Nowy Targ), Kazimierz Meto Band (Glina), Ludwik M\u0142ynarczyk Band (Lipnica), Kujawska Atlantyda (Kujawy) and Trebunie-Tutki.\nContemporary popular music.\nPoland has always been a very open country to new music genres and even before the fall of the communism, music styles like rock, metal, jazz, electronic, and new wave were well known. Since 1989, the Polish scene has exploded with new talents and a more diverse style.\nEvery year, a huge gathering of young Poles meet to honour the rock and alternative music in Jarocin, \u017bary, at Woodstock Festival Poland in Kostrzyn nad Odr\u0105 and at Open'er Festival and Off Festival. These events often attract more than 250,000 people and are comparable to the gatherings in Woodstock and Roskilde.\nIn jazz music, Polish musicians created a specific style, which was most famous in 1960s and 1970s. Some prominent Polish jazz artists are: Krzysztof Komeda, Zbigniew Namys\u0142owski, Adam Makowicz, Tomasz Sta\u0144ko, W\u0142odek Pawlik, Micha\u0142 Urbaniak, Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer. Some of the most popular and commercially successful Polish vocalists of 20th and 21st centuries are Czes\u0142aw Niemen, Edyta G\u00f3rniak, Myslovitz, Doda, Maryla Rodowicz, Kamil Bednarek, Ewa Farna, Agnieszka Chyli\u0144ska, Sylwia Grzeszczak, Micha\u0142 Szpak, Edyta Bartosiewicz, Anna Maria Jopek, Kasia Nosowska, Dawid Podsiad\u0142o, Sarsa, Monika Brodka and Margaret.\nTwo contemporary big Polish music festivals are Opole Festival and Sopot Festival. Among other important festivals there are: Jazz Jamboree, Rawa Blues Festival and Wratislavia Cantans.\nHeavy metal.\nBlack metal.\nBlack metal in Poland has evolved since the 1980s, although the first bands strictly in this genre appeared in the early 1990s, with the growth of the Norwegian black metal movement. One of the first Polish black metal bands, founded in late 1979, was Kat from Katowice, which was originally classified as thrash, and heavy metal. Kat was a major influence on Polish heavy metal music, developing their harsh sound with straightforward satanic lyrics, and later were heavily inspired by the poetry of Tadeusz Mici\u0144ski. The group has reformed several times over the years, and remains active, with their guitarist co-founder on studio projects. After a naming dispute in the early 2000s Kat &amp; Roman Kostrzewski continue with both their live, and studio legacy.\nOther bands, classified as black metal in the 1980s, include Imperator (founded in 1984) with an antichristian approach in their music, and Vader (founded in 1983) with Satan themed lyrics, appearing on stage in leather and spikes. While still active, Vader later developed a death metal sound with occult themed lyrics, Imperator's style of music is disputed; reformed twice in the 1990s, the band eventually dissolved in 2000, with only one studio album released. Minor Polish black metal bands of the 1980s include Fantom (founded 1985), Scarecrow with an origin in speed metal (formed 1987), thrash metal influenced Bundeswehra (1988), Apocalyptic Slaughter (1988), Dethroner later renamed Enormity (1987). All were short lived local acts, who only released demo recordings.\nIn the 1990s a wide range of black metal bands developed, such as Christ Agony, Mussorgski (both founded in 1990), Behemoth, Besatt, Xantotol (all founded in 1991), Oppressor later renamed Baphomets Throne, Mastiphal, Graveland, North, Taranis, Infernum (all founded in 1992), Hermh, Arkona, Thunderbolt, Profanum (all founded in 1993), Lux Occulta (founded in 1994), Darzamat (founded in 1995), Witchmaster (founded in 1996), Crionics and Vesania (founded in 1997). After its first album, Christ Agony signed to the French Adipocere Records, then to Cacophonous Records, and then to Hammerheart Records. They received a brief period of recognition in the European underground, but later became a minor act. After their seventh album in 2009 Christ Agony eventually signed to Mystic Production and gained nostalgic recognition in Poland with support from European tours.\nDuring early and mid-1990s, Behemoth, Graveland, Infernum, Profanum, Kataxu and other bands developed a distinguishable Polish black metal style, which featured a decent atmospheric keyboard usage and nature sound samples (e.g. wind, raven cries), while still preserving the raw production values. Behemoth quickly become popular in the underground with support from Graveland's mainman Rob Darken, and later with influentional label Avantgarde Music. Based in Gda\u0144sk, the band eventually developed death metal influenced sound, and gained international recognition. Other bands of the 1990s such as Baphomets Throne, North, Mussorgski, Besatt, Infernum remained active, but were signed to underground labels and never received international acclaim. In later years only Darzamat, after several album releases, were signed to Massacre Records, but their short lived European recognition was broken by lineup changes. Vesania signed to Napalm Records, went on hiatus, but released three albums in the 2000s. Later, Poland developed bands such as MasseMord, Mg\u0142a (both founded in 2000), Furia (founded in 2003), Morowe (2006) and Blaze of Perdition (2007); though all of these are only known in the underground circuit.\nWithin black metal in Poland, several National Socialist Black Metal (NSBM) bands developed such as Veles (founded in 1992), Gontyna Kry (founded in 1993), Kataxu (1994), Ohtar (1996), and Sunwheel (1998). All of which attracted the interest of the Anti-Defamation League, and were considered to perform \"music of hate\". In the early 1990s NSBM was also investigated by the Polish Office for State Protection. Although Graveland were extremely popular among NSBM fans and generally seen as a National Socialist band, Rob Darken rejects this label, and told Decibel magazine: \"I do not think Graveland is an NSBM band. Graveland is regarded as a NSBM band because of my political convictions, [which] most people would call extreme right-wing, National Socialist convictions.\"\nDeath metal.\nIn the 1980s Poland developed an early death metal movement, though at the time many of the bands were referred to as either black metal or thrash metal, many were later classified as death metal. Some of the bands of the period include Vader, which started as a classic heavy metal group (founded in 1983), and others with origin in thrash metal, like Imperator (founded in 1984), Armagedon (founded in 1986), Magnus (founded in 1987), Ghost and Thanatos later renamed Trauma (both founded in 1988), Bloodlust, and Betrayer (both founded in 1989). Many of the groups disbanded in the early 1990s after only one album, although several gained an underground following in Europe due to tape trading. Vader became the only one to remain active since its formation, and reached international fan base, with albums charting in Poland, Germany, and Japan, on labels such as Earache Records, Metal Blade Records, and Nuclear Blast among others. While Trauma also remained active since its formation they never reached the same recognition. Since the late 2000s several of the \"classic\" bands such as Magnus, Armagedon, and Merciless Death have been reformed, and have since remained active.\nIn the 1990s a second wave of death metal was developed with bands such as Violent Dirge, Lost Soul, Hazael, Hate, Pandemonium (all founded in 1990), Cerebral Concussion later renamed Devilyn, Prophecy, Dies Irae (all founded in 1992), Sceptic (founded in 1994), Decapitated, and Yattering (both founded in 1996). The highly technical music of Violent Dirge became the interest of influential label Nuclear Blast who later released the groups sampler. Although Violent Dirge dissolved in 1995 after the release of several demos, and two underground albums with success remaining only in Poland. Hazael was also subject of interest from eastern record label Century Media Records. But after signing a contract, and recording the album for the label they were dropped. This eventually lead to the break up of the band in 1996. However, they went on to reform in 2014.\nRecognition in Europe led bands such as Devilyn to get signed to Listenable Records, Yattering a recording deal with Season of Mist for their second release, and Prophecy signed to Koch International. After losing popularity Prophecy went on hiatus in 1999, and reformed in 2004, but eventually split-up in 2010, while Devilyn, and Yattering disbanded in 2006. Hate after several underground albums reached international recognition in the 2000s after signing to Listenable Records, and later Napalm Records, Dies Irae, reformed in 2000 consisting of members of Vader signed to Metal Blade Records, and released three albums, until the death of their drummer.\nIn late 1990s Decapitated was signed to Wicked World a subsidiary of Earache Records. The band released several albums, later reaching international acclaim after reforming in 2009, and a new recording deal with Nuclear Blast. After reforming in 1997 Lost Soul signed with Relapse Records to release their debut album, in 2006 the band went in hiatus, and lost their minor popularity in Europe. They once again reformed in 2009 and signed to an underground Polish label, they occasional tour in their home country. In the early 2000s with the release of third album Sceptic signed to Candlelight Records. After only touring in Poland the label eventually dropped Sceptic from their catalogue. Other minor Polish death bands active mostly in the European underground scene include Stillborn (founded in 1997), Azarath (founded in 1998), Deivos (founded in 1999) and Masachist (founded in 2006) among others. Although founded in 1991 as a black metal band Behemoth reached international acclaim from their mixture of black metal with death metal, with one album certified Gold in Poland and three charting on the Billboard 200 in the US.\nThrash metal.\nIn the early 1980s, in response to the American thrash metal wave, Poland developed their own thrash metal scene. Bands of this period include Kat (founded in late 1979), who started as a speed/heavy metal group, Turbo (founded in 1980), who had origins in rock and heavy metal, as well as some strict thrash metal bands such as Kreon, Dragon (both founded in 1984), Destroyers, Hammer (both founded in 1985), Quo Vadis, Alastor, Hunter, Wolf Spider, Acid Drinkers (all founded in 1986), and Egzekuthor (founded in 1987), among others. The 1980s is also when the thrash metal scene in Poland had the most success, with bands finding a starting place in the Metalmania festival (based in Katowice). Bands like Destroyers, Hamer, Dragon, and Wolf Spider became the subjects of interest of national record labels Pronit and Polton, with the bands sharing recordings on split albums. Destroyers continued performing until early 1990; their later albums were released by the national labels Tonpress and Polskie Nagrania Muza. Wolf Spider, after four albums, disbanded in 1991; they later reformed in 2011. Dragon, in later years, developed a death metal influenced style, and they remained active until 2000 with five albums released. Hamer, after reforming several times, remain active.\nTurbo, with their popularity based on the protest song \"Doros\u0142e dzieci\", switched to a thrash metal sound after two albums released only in Poland. Several attempts to cross over the Polish border have been made by Turbo with English language albums, which have been released by the German label Noise Records, the Italian label Metal Master Records, and the British label Under One Flag (a subsidiary of Music for Nations). Due to problems receiving passports, Turbo remains a local act; they have disbanded and reformed several times, have released eleven albums, and are still active. The band Kat had taken a similar approach; after several singles released in Poland, they signed to Belgian Ambush Records to release their debut album. Due to being unable to tour outside Poland, Kat remains local, with several Polish language albums released. Kat reformed several times over the years; they remain active solely as a studio project. After a name dispute in the early 2000s the act named Kat &amp; Roman Kostrzewski continues with their legacy.\nAcid Drinkers is another Polish band that attempted to tour outside home country. In the years after the revolutions of 1989, Acid Drinkers members revoked their passports, but after problems with visas, it occurred to them that they needed to eventually stop their protests. They remain active only in Poland and have received cult status with fifteen albums released, several of which have appeared on Polish Albums Charts. Other bands like Quo Vadis and Alastor remain active in underground scenes to incorporate in later years to their music groove, death or progressive metal. Egzekuthor disbanded in 1992 after one album, reformed in 2002 to be disbanded in 2008 before second studio effort was released. While Hunter have waited till 1995 to release first album reached acclaim in Poland with 2000s albums. Although over the years moving away from strict thrash metal style Hunter received nomination to Fryderyk, an annual award in Polish music, within several records on Polish Albums Chart have been noted, with songs to receive regular airplay. In later years several thrash metal band have emerged while none have reached the acclaim of those from the 1980s. Some of them include Geisha Goner (founded in 1990), Tuff Enuff (founded in 1992), Flapjack, Myopia (both founded in 1993), Horrorscope (founded in 1996), Virgin Snatch, and Alkatraz (both founded in 2001).\nGothic metal.\nPoland developed their gothic metal scene in the 1990s, although it was intertwined with the gothic rock movement since the beginning, focused around the Castle Party Festival founded in 1994. The scene was loosely inspired by Polish bands such as Closterkeller, Pornografia, Fading Colours (all founded in the 1980s), and in later years by British acts like Paradise Lost, My Dying Bride, Anathema, and Norwegian Theatre of Tragedy among others. The earliest of the Polish gothic bands developed their sound from various styles like rock, black, death and doom metal, that include Battalion d'Amour (founded in 1989), Neolithic, Moonlight (both founded in 1991), Sacriversum, Sirrah (both founded in 1992), Hermh, Cemetery of Scream (both founded in 1993), Hefeystos, and Tower (both founded in 1994) among others. Most Polish gothic metal bands since the 1990s reached recognition only in Poland, or for short time in Europe. Compared with the black or death movement, gothic metal is a minor music scene.\nAlthough considered as a rock band, Closterkeller developed a gothic metal sound in the late 1990s. With nine both native and English language albums released up to 2011 they became the most influential Polish gothic band. Battalion d'Amour with their poetic lyrics reached popularity with 1990s albums, which was lost after a change of the group's lead vocalist in the early 2000s. The band released their last album in 2005. Neolithic signed to French Adipocere Records developed a doom and progressive metal influenced sound. They released two albums and disbanded in 2006 with brief recognition in their home country. Moonlight active until 2007 released several albums in 2000s, combining a gothic metal style with trip hop and rock. Reformed several of times of the years, Hermh began as a gothic metal act before switching to symphonic black metal with vampire themed lyrics, and remains a studio project. Cemetery of Scream with five albums released is still active. Hefeystos, with a progressive rock influenced sound, released two albums, and eventually disbanded in 2000. While Tower disbanded in the late 1990s, also with two albums released. Only Sirrah reached short-lived recognition in Europe with a recording deal from Music for Nations. Disbanded in 1998, the group was reformed in 2013 and is still active.\nThe second wave of gothic bands includes Artrosis, Lorien (both founded in 1995), Aion, Desdemona (both founded in 1996), Sator (later renamed Delight; founded in 1997), and Via Mistica (founded in 1998), among others. Artrosis quickly reached popularity in Poland with albums released by local label Morbid Noizz Productions. In the late 1990s Artrosis became the subject of interest from Tilo Wolffs label Hall of Sermon which released an English version of one of their albums. The band reached its popularity in the early 2000s with a contract from Metal Mind Productions. The band released seven Polish and four English language albums and remain active. Loriens popularity came with a debut album released by underground labels in Europe, USA, and Australia with promotion from Polskie Radio in their home country. After several line-up changes and one more album released, Lorien disbanded in 2005. Eight years later the group was reformed and is still active. While Aion gained some European acclaim with two albums released by Massacre Records, and Impact Records. In later years the band remained local act with a recording deal from Metal Mind Productions. Eventually changing style to modern heavy metal on their fifth album, Aion disbanded after its release in 2004.\nAlthough Desdemona's debut album was released in Japan, the band became a local act with albums released by Metal Mind Productions, eventually dropping their gothic metal style in favour of industrial with four album released, and a recording deal from Danse Macabre Records. Delight which began as a power metal band reached recognition in Poland with support from extensive touring, and several both Polish and English language albums released in the early 2000s. In 2005 after a performance at Wave Gotik Treffen in Germany Delight was signed to Roadrunner Records, although after one album released the group was disbanded with no official statement. Via Mistica remains a local act with three albums released in the early 2000s. In later years several gothic metal bands have emerged, most of them remaining minor part of Polish heavy metal scene, that include such acts like Mystherium (founded in 2001), Ciryam (founded in 2003), UnSun (founded in 2006), and NeraNature (founded in 2009) among others. Only UnSun reached international acclaim with a recording deal from Century Media Records, and albums charting in Japan, although after two albums the group went on hiatus due to problems with the vocalist's health.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the sound version of the film has no audible dialogue, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects. The original soundtrack to the sound version is preserved at UCLA.\nThe film stars Clara Bow, Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, and Richard Arlen. Rogers and Arlen portray World War I combat pilots in a romantic rivalry over a woman. It was produced by Lucien Hubbard, directed by William A. Wellman, and released by Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation. Gary Cooper appears in a small role, which helped launch his career in Hollywood.\nThe film, a romantic action-war picture, was rewritten by scriptwriters Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton from a story by John Monk Saunders to accommodate Bow, Paramount's biggest star at the time. Wellman was hired, as he was the only director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience, although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2\u00a0million (equivalent to $ in 2024) at Kelly Field in San Antonio, between September 7, 1926, and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots and planes of the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance and supervision. Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3,500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.\nAcclaimed for its technical prowess and realism upon release, the film became the yardstick against which future aviation films were measured, mainly because of its realistic air-combat sequences. It went on to win the inaugural Academy Award for Outstanding Picture at the first Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences award ceremony in 1929, the only fully silent film to do so. It also won the Academy Award for Best Engineering Effects (Roy Pomeroy). \"Wings\" was one of the first widely released films to show nudity. In 1997, \"Wings\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\", and the film was re-released to Cinemark theaters to coincide with the 85th anniversary for a limited run in May 2012. The film was re-released again for its 90th anniversary in 2017. The Academy Film Archive preserved \"Wings\" in 2002.\nThe film entered the public domain in the United States in 2023.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nJack Powell and David Armstrong are rivals in the same small American town, both vying for the attentions of pretty Sylvia Lewis. Jack fails to realize that \"the girl next door\", Mary Preston, is desperately in love with him. The two young men both enlist to become combat pilots in the Army Air Service. When they leave for training camp, Jack mistakenly believes Sylvia prefers him, but she actually prefers David and lets him know about her feelings, but is too kindhearted to turn down Jack's affection.\nThe two men endure a rigorous training period, where they are enemies. But during a bloody boxing match, they realize each other's courage and become best friends. Upon graduating, they are sent to France to fight against Imperial Germany.\nJack and David are billeted together. Their tent mate is Cadet White, but their acquaintance is all too brief; White is killed in an air crash the same day.\nMary joins the war effort by becoming an ambulance driver. She later learns of Jack's reputation as the ace known as \"The Shooting Star\" and encounters him while on leave in Paris. She finds him, but he is too drunk to recognize her. She takes him back to his room and puts him to bed, but when two military police barge-in while she is innocently changing from a borrowed dress back into her uniform in the same room, she is forced to resign and return to the United States.\nThe climax of the story comes with the epic Battle of Saint-Mihiel. David is shot down and presumed dead. However, he survives the crash landing, steals a German biplane, and heads for the Allied lines. By a tragic stroke of bad luck, Jack spots the enemy aircraft and, bent on avenging his friend, begins an attack. He is successful in downing the aircraft and lands to retrieve a souvenir of his victory. The owner of the land where David's aircraft crashed urges Jack to come to the dying man's side. He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him, and before he dies, forgives his comrade.\nAt the war's end, Jack returns home to a hero's welcome. He visits David's grieving parents to return his friend's effects. During the visit, he begs their forgiveness for causing David's death. Mrs. Armstrong says it is not Jack who is responsible for her son's death, but the war. Then, Jack is reunited with Mary and realizes he loves her.\nMusic.\nThe film featured a theme song entitled \"Wings\" which was composed by J. S Zamecnik and Ballard Macdonald.\nProduction.\nScript and experience.\nThe film was written by John Monk Saunders (with uncredited story ideas contributed by Byron Morgan), Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton (screenplay), produced by Lucien Hubbard (who also did uncredited co-editing), directed by William A. Wellman, with an original orchestral score by J.S. Zamecnik, which was also uncredited. It was rewritten to accommodate Clara Bow, as she was Paramount's biggest star, but she wasn't happy about her part: \"\"Wings\" is...a man's picture and I'm just the whipped cream on top of the pie\".\nProducers Lucien Hubbard and Jesse L. Lasky hired director Wellman as he was the only director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat pilot experience. Actor Richard Arlen and writer John Monk Saunders had also served in World War I as military aviators. Arlen was able to do his own flying in the film and Rogers, a non-pilot, underwent flight training during the course of the production, so that, like Arlen, Rogers could also be filmed in closeup in the air. Lucien Hubbard offered flying lessons to all, and despite the number of aircraft in the air, only two incidents occurred\u2014one involved stunt pilot Dick Grace, who broke his neck falling out of the cockpit after a controlled crash; while the other was the fatal crash of an Army Air Service pilot. Wellman was able to attract War Department support and involvement in the project, and displayed considerable prowess and confidence in dealing with planes and pilots onscreen, knowing \"exactly what he wanted\", bringing with it a \"no-nonsense attitude\" according to military film historian Lawrence H. Suid.\nFilming.\nAerial and battle sequences.\n\"Wings\" was shot and completed on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field, San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926, and April 7, 1927. Primary scout aircraft flown in the film were Thomas-Morse MB-3s standing in for American-flown SPADs and Curtiss P-1 Hawks painted in German livery. Developing the techniques needed for filming closeups of the pilots in the air and capturing the speed and motion of the planes onscreen took time, and little usable footage was produced in the first two months. Wellman soon realized that Kelly Field did not have the adequate numbers of planes or skilled pilots to perform the needed aerial maneuvers, and he had to request technical assistance and a supply of planes and pilots from Washington. The Air Corps sent six planes and pilots from the 1st Pursuit Group stationed at Selfridge Field near Detroit, including then-2nd Lt. Elmer J. Rogers Jr. and 2d Lt. Clarence S. \"Bill\" Irvine who became Wellman's adviser. Irvine was responsible for engineering an airborne camera system to provide close-ups and for the planning of the dogfights, and when one of the pilots broke his neck, performed in one of the battle scenes himself.\nHundreds of extras were brought in to shoot the picture, and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming. Because the aerial battles required ideal weather to shoot, the production team had to wait on one occasion for 18 consecutive days for proper conditions in San Antonio. If possible, Wellman attempted to capture footage in the air in contrast to clouds in the background, above or in front of cloud banks to generate a sense of velocity and danger. Wellman later explained, \"motion on the screen is a relative thing. A horse runs on the ground or leaps over fencers or streams. We know he is going rapidly because of his relation to the immobile ground\". Against the clouds, Wellman enabled the planes to \"dart at each other\", and to \"swoop down and disappear in the clouds\", and to give the audience the sense of the disabled planes plummeting. During the delay in the aerial shooting, Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen. A large battlefield with trenches and barbed wire was created on location for the filming. Wellman took responsibility for the meticulously planned explosions himself, detonating them at the right time from his control panel. According to Peter Hopkinson, at least 20 young men, including cameraman William Clothier, were given hand-held cameras to film \"anything and everything\" during the filming.\nWellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture, especially the infantry commander whom he considered to have \"two monumental hatreds: fliers and movie people\". After one argument Wellman retorted to the commander, \"You're just a goddamn fool because the government has told me you have to give me all your men and do just exactly what I want you to do.\" Although Wellman paid much attention to technical details in shooting, he used cars and clothing of the year during the filming, forgetting to use those of World War I. He took six weeks to fully edit the film and prepare it for release.\nCast exploits.\nWhereas most Hollywood productions of the day took little more than a month to shoot, \"Wings\" took approximately nine months to complete in total. Although Wellman was generating spectacular aerial footage and making Hollywood film history, Paramount expressed concerns with the cost of production and expanding budget. They sent an executive to San Antonio to complain to Wellman who swiftly told him that he had two options, \"a trip home or a trip to the hospital\". According to biographer Frank T. Thompson, Wellman approached producer David O. Selznick regarding a contract predicament asking him what he should do to which Selznick replied, \"Just keep your mouth shut. You've got 'em where it hurts.\" Otto Kahn, the financier bankrolling the production, arrived on set as Wellman was filming the St-Mihiel battle sequence, inadvertently disrupted Wellman's detonation timings, and caused several extras to be seriously injured. Wellman loudly and profanely ordered Kahn off the set. That evening, Kahn visited Wellman in his hotel room, told him he was impressed with his direction, and he could have whatever he needed to finish the picture.\nThe cast and crew had a lot of time on their hands between shooting sequences, and according to director Wellman, \"San Antonio became the Armageddon of a magnificent sexual Donnybrook\". He recalled that they stayed at the Saint Anthony Hotel for nine months and by the time they left the elevator girls were all pregnant. He stated that Clara Bow openly flirted with the male cast members and several of the pilots which was reciprocated, despite having become engaged to Victor Fleming the day after arriving in San Antonio on September 16, 1926. Gary Cooper, appearing in a role which helped launch his career in Hollywood, began a tumultuous affair during the production with Bow. Cooper reportedly showed Howard Hughes the script to the film and he was not impressed, considering the drama in it to be \"sudsy\", although he informed Cooper that he looked forward to seeing how Wellman would accomplish the technical aerial sequences. Bow strongly detested the wardrobe that Paramount designer Travis Banton made for the film. She slit the necklines and cut off the sleeves of her costumes, much to Banton's chagrin.\nNotable scenes.\n\"Wings\" is also one of the first widely released films to show nudity. In the enlistment office, nude men are visible from behind undergoing physical exams, through a door which opens and closes several times. In the scene in which Rogers becomes drunk, the intoxication displayed on screen was genuine, as although 22 years of age, he had never tasted liquor before, and quickly became inebriated from drinking champagne. During David's death scene, Jack is plainly observed kissing him on the left cheek near the left corner of Dave's mouth, which has led to interpretations of this film as depicting cinema's first male-to-male kiss. While there is no general consensus about which film achieves this LGBT milestone, D.W. Griffith's \"Intolerance\" (1916), Cecil B. DeMille's \"Manslaughter\" (1922), and Josef von Sternberg's \"Morocco\" (1930) have also been suggested.\nRelease and reception.\nWellman dedicated the film \"to those young warriors of the sky whose wings are folded about them forever\". A sneak preview was shown May 19, 1927, at the Texas Theater on Houston Street in San Antonio. The premiere was held at the Criterion Theater, in New York City, on August 12, 1927, and was screened for 63 weeks before being moved to second-run theaters. The film eventually opened in Los Angeles on January 15, 1928. The original Paramount release of \"Wings\" was color tinted and had some sequences in an early widescreen process known as Magnascope, also used in the 1926 Paramount film \"Old Ironsides\". The original release also had the aerial scenes use the Handschiegl color process for flames and explosions. Late in 1928, a sound version was prepared with synchronized sound effects and music, using the General Electric Kinegraphone (later RCA Photophone) sound-on-film process.\n\"Wings\" was an immediate success upon release and became the yardstick against which successive aviation films were measured for years thereafter, in terms of \"authenticity of combat and scope of production\". One of the reasons for its resounding popularity was the public infatuation with aviation in the wake of Charles Lindbergh's transatlantic flight. The Air Corps who had supervised production expressed satisfaction with the end product. The critical response was equally enthusiastic and the film was widely praised for its realism and technical prowess, despite a superficial plot, \"an aviation picnic\" as Gene Brown called it. The combat scenes of the film were so realistic that one writer studying the film in the early 1970s was wondering if Wellman had used actual imagery of planes crashing to earth during World War I. One critic observed: \"The exceptional quality of \"Wings\" lies in its appeal as a spectacle and as a picture of at least some of the actualities of flying under wartime conditions.\" Another wrote: \"Nothing in the line of war pictures ever has packed a greater proportion of real thrills into an equal footage. As a spectacle, \"Wings\" is a technical triumph. It piles punch upon punch until the spectator is almost nervously exhausted\". Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" praised the cinematography of the flying scenes and the direction and acting of the entire cast in his review dated August 13, 1927. Hall notes only two criticisms, one slight on Richard Arlen's performance and of the ending, which he described as \"like so many screen stories, much too sentimental, and there is far more of it than one wants.\"\nBy June 1932, \"Wings\" had earned $3.6 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 93% based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \"Subsequent war epics may have borrowed heavily from the original Best Picture winner, but they've all lacked Clara Bow's luminous screen presence and William Wellman's deft direction.\"\nAccolades.\nOn May 16, 1929, the first Academy Award ceremony was held at the Hotel Roosevelt in Hollywood to honor outstanding film achievements of 1927\u20131928. \"Wings\" was entered in a number of categories and was the first film to win the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called \"Best Picture, Production\") and Best Engineering Effects for Roy Pomeroy for the year. It remains the only silent film to win Best Picture.\n\"\", which won Unique and Artistic Production, was considered an equal top winner of the night but the following year, the academy dropped the Unique and Artistic Production award and decided retroactively that the award won by \"Wings\" was the highest honor that could be awarded. The statuette, not yet known as the \"Oscar\", was presented by Douglas Fairbanks to Clara Bow on behalf of the producers, Adolph Zukor and B.P. Schulberg.\nLegacy.\nThe Cross and Cockade, a World War I pilots association, decided to host a tribute to \"Wings\" in 1968. They found Paramount did not even have photos. They recreated stock film, reprinted the picture and had a retrospective inviting the director and stars Richard Arlen and Buddy Rogers. The brochure was available for a small period of years but is reprinted in a book narrated by Richard Arlen, published by Judy Watson, titled \"Wings and other Recollections of Early Hollywood\" and .\nFor many years, \"Wings\" was considered a lost film until a print was found in the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise film archive in Paris and quickly copied from nitrate film to safety film stock. It was again shown in theaters, including some theaters where the film was accompanied by Wurlitzer pipe organs.\nIn retrospect, film scholar Scott Eyman in his 1997 book \"The Speed of Sound: Hollywood and the Talkie Revolution 1926\u20131930\" highlights both the diverse structure and adapted aspects of \"Wings\" in that transitional period in American cinematography:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Ironically, a mass-market silent spectacular like William Wellman's \"Wings\" effortlessly showcases far more visual variety than mainstream American films have offered since: it displays shifts from brutal realism to nonrealistic techniques associated with Soviet avant-garde or impressionistic French cinema \u2013 double exposures, subjective point-of-view shots, trick effects, symbolic illustrations on the titles, and so on.\nIn 1997, \"Wings\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In 2006, director Wellman's son, William Wellman Jr., authored a book about the film and his father's participation in the making of it, titled \"The Man and His Wings: William A. Wellman and the Making of the First Best Picture.\"\nThe film was the focus of an episode of the television series \"Petticoat Junction\" that originally aired November 9, 1968, the show's sixth season. Arlen and Rogers were scheduled to appear during the film's opening at one of the local cinemas in 1928. They opted instead to attend the New York screening that was held the same night. Uncle Joe writes a letter chiding the pair for forsaking the town. To atone and generate publicity, they agreed to attend a second opening, 40 years later. This episode features actual clips from the film.\nArlen and Rogers also appeared together as themselves on a December 18, 1967, episode of \"The Lucy Show\" titled \"Lucy and Carol Burnett: Part 2\". They are introduced as the stars of \"Wings\" at a ceremony to mark the graduation of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett from stewardess training. They appear on stage beneath stills taken from the film and later in the ceremony, star in a musical with Ball and Burnett, as two World War I pilots.\nShortly after the film entered the public domain, it was adapted into a stage play by Alaina Tennant. A workshop production was held at Ohio University in 2024.\nRestoration.\nAs the original negatives are lost, the closest to an original copy is a spare negative rediscovered in Paramount's vaults subsequent to the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise print. Suffering from decay and defects, the negative was fully restored with modern technology. The original synchronized soundtrack to the sound version survives at UCLA. For the restored version of \"Wings\", it was decided not to use the original, now public-domain, synchronized score so that a new modern soundtrack could be used. The original music score was re-orchestrated. The sound effects were recreated at Skywalker Sound using archived audio tracks. The scenes using the Handschiegl color process were also recreated for the restored version.\nThe first restored version was released on Laserdisc in the US in 1985, was one of the earliest discs with digital sound, and featured an organ score by Gaylord Carter. This version would be released in a double feature with \"The Big Parade\" for its Japanese Laserdisc release.\nIn 1996, Paramount issued a VHS release. In 2012, the company issued a \"meticulously restored\" version for DVD and Blu-ray. The remastered version in high definition coincided with the centennial anniversary of Paramount. It opens with a logo montage, which starts with the 2010\u20132013 version of the previous logo or the 2011\u20132012 \"100 Years\" version of the current logo and looks back at previous logos from the past 100 years, starting with the 1990 version of the 1986 logo, up into the opening logo of the film. On May 2 and 16, 2012, select Cinemark theaters screened an exclusive limited re-release twice daily to coincide with the film's 85th anniversary. It received a worldwide limited release for its 90th anniversary celebration.\nThe film was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with the Library of Congress and Paramount Pictures, in 2002.\nThe sound version of the film was created late in 1928 due to the public's apathy towards silent films and therefore this was the version that most audiences saw back in 1928 and 1929. Even though the original synchronized soundtrack survives at UCLA it has not yet been restored to the film and released.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Stone. The film was produced by Howard Hughes, written by Bartlett Cormack and Tom Miranda, and was distributed by Paramount Pictures. It was adapted from Cormack's 1927 Broadway play \"The Racket\".\nPlot.\nChicago Police Department officer James \"Mac\" McQuigg tries to keep the peace in Chicago during the Prohibition gang wars but is hampered by massive corruption. After a shootout McQuigg manages to arrest mob boss Nick Scarsi's henchman Spike Corcoran, the political boss \"The Old Man\" arranges to have all charges dropped. After a birthday party for Nick Scarsi's younger brother Joe Scarsi ends in a shootout in which Nick Scarsi kills Corcoran, McQuigg arrests Nick Scarsi for murder but is forced to release him after being unable to find the murder weapon.\nAlthough McQuigg vows to bring down Nick Scarsi, he gets transferred to \"the sticks\" of the 28th precinct. After Joe Scarsi is arrested for a hit-and-run accident, McQuigg convinces his girlfriend Helen Hayes to implicate him. Nick Scarsi arrives and shoots the witness Patrolman Johnson, and McQuigg arrests him again for murder. When Nick Scarsi's attorney arrives with a writ of \"habeas corpus\" to free him, McQuigg rips it up and imprisons him as well. Hayes falls in love with cub reporter Dave Ames, and tricks Nick Scarsi into confessing to keep him from killing Ames. With Nick Scarsi implicated in a crime, \"The Old Man\" and District Attorney Welch's political machine turn on Nick Scarsi in order to remain in power at the upcoming municipal election. They trick him into attempting to escape and trying to shoot McQuigg with an empty gun before killing him themselves.\nBackground.\nDue to the controversial portrayal of a corrupt police force and city government, both the film and the play were banned at the time in Chicago. The main antagonist Nick Scarsi was modeled after Al Capone while \"The Old Man\" was modeled after Chicago Mayor William Hale \"Big Bill\" Thompson.\nReception.\n\"The Racket\" is one of the films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called Outstanding Picture) in the 1929 Academy Awards.\nOn review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100 percent based on 6 critics, with an average rating of 7.50 out of 10.\n\"Variety\" wrote \"A good story, plus good direction, plus a great cast and minus dumb supervision, is responsible for another great underworld film\".\nPreservation.\nOnly one copy of the film was known to exist. It was long thought lost before being located in Howard Hughes' film collection after his death. \"The Racket\" was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016. It airs occasionally on Turner Classic Movies.\nRemake.\nThe Howard Hughes-owned RKO studios remade \"The Racket\" in 1951 with Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan in the lead roles.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

DCS most commonly occurs during or soon after a decompression ascent from underwater diving, but can also result from other causes of depressurization, such as emerging from a caisson, decompression from saturation, flying in an unpressurised aircraft at high altitude, and extravehicular activity from spacecraft. DCS and arterial gas embolism are collectively referred to as decompression illness.\nSince bubbles can form in or migrate to any part of the body, DCS can produce many symptoms, and its effects may vary from joint pain and rashes to paralysis and death. DCS often causes air bubbles to settle in major joints like knees or elbows, causing individuals to bend over in excruciating pain, hence its common name, the bends. Individual susceptibility can vary from day to day, and different individuals under the same conditions may be affected differently or not at all. The classification of types of DCS according to symptoms has evolved since its original description in the 19th century. The severity of symptoms varies from barely noticeable to rapidly fatal.\nDecompression sickness can occur after an exposure to increased pressure while breathing a gas with a metabolically inert component, then decompressing too fast for it to be harmlessly eliminated through respiration, or by decompression by an upward excursion from a condition of saturation by the inert breathing gas components, or by a combination of these routes. Theoretical decompression risk is controlled by the tissue compartment with the highest inert gas concentration, which for decompression from saturation, is the slowest tissue to outgas.\nThe risk of DCS can be managed through proper decompression procedures, and contracting the condition has become uncommon. Its potential severity has driven much research to prevent it, and divers almost universally use decompression schedules or dive computers to limit their exposure and to monitor their ascent speed. If DCS is suspected, it is treated by hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a recompression chamber. Where a chamber is not accessible within a reasonable time frame, in-water recompression may be indicated for a narrow range of presentations, if there are suitably skilled personnel and appropriate equipment available on site. Diagnosis is confirmed by a positive response to the treatment. Early treatment results in a significantly higher chance of successful recovery.\nClassification.\nDCS is classified by symptoms. The earliest descriptions of DCS used the terms: \"bends\" for joint or skeletal pain; \"chokes\" for breathing problems; and \"staggers\" for neurological problems. In 1960, Golding \"et al.\" introduced a simpler classification using the term \"Type I ('simple')\" for symptoms involving only the skin, musculoskeletal system, or lymphatic system, and \"Type II ('serious')\" for symptoms where other organs (such as the central nervous system) are involved. Type II DCS is considered more serious and usually has worse outcomes. This system, with minor modifications, may still be used today. Following changes to treatment methods, this classification is now much less useful in diagnosis, since neurological symptoms may develop after the initial presentation, and both Type I and Type II DCS have the same initial management.\nDecompression illness and dysbarism.\nThe term dysbarism encompasses decompression sickness, arterial gas embolism, and barotrauma, whereas decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism are commonly classified together as decompression illness when a precise diagnosis cannot be made. DCS and arterial gas embolism are treated very similarly because they are both the result of gas bubbles in the body. The U.S. Navy prescribes identical treatment for Type II DCS and arterial gas embolism. Their spectra of symptoms also overlap, although the symptoms from arterial gas embolism are generally more severe because they often arise from an infarction (blockage of blood supply and tissue death).\nSigns and symptoms.\nWhile bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain (\"the bends\") accounts for about 60% to 70% of all altitude DCS cases, with the shoulder being the most common site for altitude and bounce diving, and the knees and hip joints for saturation and compressed air work. Neurological symptoms are present in 10% to 15% of DCS cases with headache and visual disturbances being the most common symptom. Skin manifestations are present in about 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS (\"the chokes\") is very rare in divers and has been observed much less frequently in aviators since the introduction of oxygen pre-breathing protocols. The table below shows symptoms for different DCS types.\nFrequency.\nThe relative frequencies of different symptoms of DCS observed by the U.S. Navy are as follows:\nOnset.\nAlthough the onset of DCS can occur rapidly after a dive, in more than half of all cases, symptoms do not begin to appear for at least an hour. In extreme cases, symptoms may occur before the dive has been completed. The U.S. Navy and Technical Diving International, a leading technical diver training organization, have published a table that documents the time to onset of first symptoms. The table does not differentiate between types of DCS, or types of symptom.\nCauses.\nDCS is caused by a reduction in ambient pressure that results in the formation of bubbles of inert gases within tissues of the body. It may happen when leaving a high-pressure environment, ascending from depth, or ascending to altitude. A closely related condition of bubble formation in body tissues due to isobaric counterdiffusion can occur with no change of pressure.\nAscent from depth.\nDCS is best known as a diving disorder that affects divers who have breathed gas that is at a higher pressure than the surface pressure, owing to the pressure of the surrounding water. The risk of DCS increases when diving for extended periods or at greater depth, without ascending gradually and making the decompression stops needed to slowly reduce the excess pressure of inert gases dissolved in the body. The specific risk factors are not well understood and some divers may be more susceptible than others under identical conditions. DCS has been confirmed in rare cases of breath-holding divers who have made a sequence of many deep dives with short surface intervals, and may be the cause of the disease called taravana by South Pacific island natives who for centuries have dived by breath-holding for food and pearls.\nTwo principal factors control the risk of a diver developing DCS:\nEven when the change in pressure causes no immediate symptoms, rapid pressure change can cause permanent bone injury called dysbaric osteonecrosis (DON). DON can develop from a single exposure to rapid decompression.\nLeaving a high-pressure environment.\nWhen workers leave a pressurized caisson or a mine that has been pressurized to keep water out, they will experience a significant reduction in ambient pressure. A similar pressure reduction occurs when astronauts exit a space vehicle to perform a space-walk or extra-vehicular activity, where the pressure in their spacesuit is lower than the pressure in the vehicle.\nThe original name for DCS was \"caisson disease\". This term was introduced in the 19th century, when caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding large engineering excavations below the water table, such as bridge supports and tunnels. Workers spending time in high ambient pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson if the pressure is not reduced slowly. DCS was a major factor during the construction of Eads Bridge, when 15 workers died from what was then a mysterious illness, and later during the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, where it incapacitated the project leader Washington Roebling. On the other side of the Manhattan island during construction of the Hudson River Tunnel, contractor's agent Ernest William Moir noted in 1889 that workers were dying due to decompression sickness; Moir pioneered the use of an airlock chamber for treatment.\nAscent to altitude or exposure to a low ambient pressure.\nA decompression from surface pressure at or near sea level to a lower ambient pressure due to altitude or artificial pressure reduction may cause bubble formation in supersaturated tissues, which is a manifestation of decompression sickness called altitude DCS, hypobaric DCS, or aerospace DCS. This is usually a decompression from saturation at surface pressure.\nThe most common health risk on ascent to altitude is not decompression sickness but altitude sickness, or acute mountain sickness (AMS), which has an entirely different and unrelated set of causes and symptoms. AMS results not from the formation of bubbles from dissolved gases in the body but from exposure to a low partial pressure of oxygen and alkalosis. However, passengers in unpressurized aircraft at high altitude may also be at some risk of DCS.\nAltitude DCS became a problem in the 1930s with the development of high-altitude balloon and aircraft flights, but not as great a problem as AMS, which drove the development of pressurized cabins, which coincidentally controlled DCS. Commercial aircraft are now required to maintain the cabin at or below a pressure altitude of even when flying above . Symptoms of DCS in healthy individuals are subsequently very rare unless there is a loss of pressurization or the individual has been diving recently. Divers who drive up a mountain or fly shortly after diving are at particular risk even in a pressurized aircraft because the regulatory cabin altitude of represents only 73% of sea level pressure.\nGenerally, the higher the altitude the greater the risk of altitude DCS but there is no specific, maximum, safe altitude below which it never occurs. There are very few symptoms at or below unless the person had predisposing medical conditions or had dived recently. There is a correlation between increased altitudes above and the frequency of altitude DCS but there is no direct relationship with the severity of the various types of DCS. A US Air Force study reports that there are few occurrences between and and 87% of incidents occurred at or above . High-altitude parachutists may reduce the risk of altitude DCS if they flush nitrogen from the body by pre-breathing pure oxygen. A similar procedure is used by astronauts and cosmonauts preparing for extravehicular activity in low-pressure space suits.\nPredisposing factors.\nAlthough the occurrence of DCS is not easily predictable, many predisposing factors are known. They may be considered as either environmental or individual. Decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving are associated with certain demographic, environmental, and dive style factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, gender, body mass index, smoking, asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous decompression illness, years since certification, dives in the last year, number of diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, last dive depth, nitrox use, and drysuit use. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, smoking, or body mass index. Increased depth, previous DCI, larger number of consecutive days diving, and being male were associated with a higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. Nitrox and drysuit use, greater frequency of diving in the past year, increasing age, and years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.\nEnvironmental.\nThe following environmental factors have been shown to increase the risk of DCS:\nIndividual.\nThe following individual factors have been identified as possibly contributing to increased risk of DCS:\n\"Undeserved\" decompression sickness.\nA common misconception or misnomer is \"undeserved\" decompression sickness, which is more accurately decompression sickness that was not predicted by the algorithm or tables used. The algorithms and tables calculated from them use a simplistic mathematical model to predict decompression sickness which uses the dive profile as input and a mathematical approximation of tissue gas dynamics which omits a number of factors which are known or suspected to exist, but for which there is no known tested and reliable model to take the effects of these factors into account. In several cases, there is also no currently available way to measure the factors in a meaningful way, so they are either simply omitted or an arbitrary manual or programmed input is used to produce a more conservative, therefore \"safer\" profile, but the reduction in risk is generally unknown. When these necessarily oversimplified models occasionally fail, some divers claim that the decompression symptoms were \"undeserved\" as they followed the directions of the computed schedule.\nMechanism.\nDepressurisation causes inert gases, which were dissolved under higher pressure, to come out of physical solution and form gas bubbles within the body. These bubbles produce the symptoms of decompression sickness. Bubbles may form whenever the body experiences a reduction in pressure, but not all bubbles result in DCS. The amount of gas dissolved in a liquid is described by Henry's Law, which indicates that when the pressure of a gas in contact with a liquid is decreased, the amount of that gas dissolved in the liquid will also decrease proportionately.\nOn ascent from a dive, inert gas comes out of solution in a process called \"outgassing\" or \"offgassing\". Under normal conditions, most offgassing occurs by gas exchange in the lungs. If inert gas comes out of solution too quickly to allow outgassing in the lungs, then bubbles may form in the blood or within the solid tissues of the body. The formation of bubbles in the skin or joints results in milder symptoms, while large numbers of bubbles in the venous blood can cause lung damage. The most severe types of DCS interrupt\u00a0\u2013 and ultimately damage\u00a0\u2013 spinal cord function, leading to paralysis, sensory dysfunction, or death. In the presence of a right-to-left shunt of the heart, such as a patent foramen ovale, venous bubbles may enter the arterial system, resulting in an arterial gas embolism. A similar effect, known as ebullism, may occur during explosive decompression, when water vapour forms bubbles in body fluids due to a dramatic reduction in environmental pressure.\nInert gases.\nThe main inert gas in air is nitrogen, but nitrogen is not the only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it is preferred over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.\nThere is some debate as to the decompression requirements for helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some groups like the WKPP have been experimenting with the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops. The balance of evidence as of 2020 does not indicate that deep stops increase decompression efficiency.\nAny inert gas that is breathed under pressure can form bubbles when the ambient pressure decreases. Very deep dives have been made using hydrogen\u2013oxygen mixtures (hydrox), but controlled decompression is still required to avoid DCS.\nIsobaric counterdiffusion.\nDCS can also be caused at a constant ambient pressure when switching between gas mixtures containing different proportions of inert gas. This is known as isobaric counterdiffusion, and presents a problem for very deep dives. For example, after using a very helium-rich trimix at the deepest part of the dive, a diver will switch to mixtures containing progressively less helium and more oxygen and nitrogen during the ascent. Nitrogen diffuses into tissues 2.65 times slower than helium but is about 4.5 times more soluble. Switching between gas mixtures that have very different fractions of nitrogen and helium can result in \"fast\" tissues (those tissues that have a good blood supply) actually increasing their total inert gas loading. This is often found to provoke inner ear decompression sickness, as the ear seems particularly sensitive to this effect.\nBubble formation.\nThe location of micronuclei or where bubbles initially form is not known. The most likely mechanisms for bubble formation are tribonucleation, when two surfaces make and break contact (such as in joints), and heterogeneous nucleation, where bubbles are created at a site based on a surface in contact with the liquid. Homogeneous nucleation, where bubbles form within the liquid itself, is less likely because it requires much greater pressure differences than experienced in decompression. The spontaneous formation of nanobubbles on hydrophobic surfaces is a possible source of micronuclei, but it is not yet clear if these can grow large enough to cause symptoms, as they are very stable.\nOnce microbubbles have formed, they can grow by either a reduction in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the gas from its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel and the rate of delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.\nPathophysiology.\nThe primary provoking agent in decompression sickness is bubble formation from excess dissolved gases. Various hypotheses have been put forward for the nucleation and growth of bubbles in tissues, and for the level of supersaturation which will support bubble growth. The earliest bubble formation detected is subclinical intravascular bubbles detectable by Doppler ultrasound in the venous systemic circulation. The presence of these \"silent\" bubbles is no guarantee that they will persist and grow to be symptomatic.\nVascular bubbles formed in the systemic capillaries may be trapped in the lung capillaries, temporarily blocking them. If this is severe, the symptom called \"chokes\" may occur. If the diver has a patent foramen ovale (or a shunt in the pulmonary circulation), bubbles may pass through it and bypass the pulmonary circulation to enter the arterial blood. If these bubbles are not absorbed in the arterial plasma and lodge in systemic capillaries, they will block the flow of oxygenated blood to the tissues supplied by those capillaries, and those tissues will be starved of oxygen. Moon and Kisslo (1988) concluded that \"the evidence suggests that the risk of serious neurological DCI or early onset DCI is increased in divers with a resting right\u2013to-left shunt through a PFO. There is, at present, no evidence that PFO is related to mild or late-onset bends. Bubbles form within other tissues as well as the blood vessels. Inert gas can diffuse into bubble nuclei between tissues. In this case, the bubbles can distort and permanently damage the tissue. As they grow, the bubbles may also compress nerves, causing pain. Extravascular or autochthonous bubbles usually form in slow tissues such as joints, tendons and muscle sheaths. Direct expansion causes tissue damage, with the release of histamines and their associated effects. Biochemical damage may be as important as, or more important than, mechanical effects.\nBubble size and growth may be affected by several factors \u2013 gas exchange with adjacent tissues, the presence of surfactants, coalescence and disintegration by collision. Vascular bubbles may cause direct blockage, aggregate platelets and red blood cells, and trigger the coagulation process, causing local and downstream clotting.\nArteries may be blocked by intravascular fat aggregation. Platelets accumulate in the vicinity of bubbles. Endothelial damage may be a mechanical effect of bubble pressure on the vessel walls, a toxic effect of stabilised platelet aggregates and possibly toxic effects due to the association of lipids with the air bubbles. Protein molecules may be denatured by reorientation of the secondary and tertiary structure when non-polar groups protrude into the bubble gas and hydrophilic groups remain in the surrounding blood, which may generate a cascade of pathophysiological events with consequent production of clinical signs of decompression sickness.\nThe physiological effects of a reduction in environmental pressure depend on the rate of bubble growth, the site, and surface activity. A sudden release of sufficient pressure in saturated tissue results in a complete disruption of cellular organelles, while a more gradual reduction in pressure may allow accumulation of a smaller number of larger bubbles, some of which may not produce clinical signs, but still cause physiological effects typical of a blood/gas interface and mechanical effects. Gas is dissolved in all tissues, but decompression sickness is only clinically recognised in the central nervous system, bone, ears, teeth, skin and lungs.\nNecrosis has frequently been reported in the lower cervical, thoracic, and upper lumbar regions of the spinal cord. A catastrophic pressure reduction from saturation produces explosive mechanical disruption of cells by local effervescence, while a more gradual pressure loss tends to produce discrete bubbles accumulated in the white matter, surrounded by a protein layer. Typical acute spinal decompression injury occurs in the columns of white matter. Infarcts are characterised by a region of oedema, haemorrhage and early myelin degeneration, and are typically centred on small blood vessels. The lesions are generally discrete. Oedema usually extends to the adjacent grey matter. Microthrombi are found in the blood vessels associated with the infarcts.\nFollowing the acute changes, there is an invasion of lipid phagocytes and degeneration of adjacent neural fibres with vascular hyperplasia at the edges of the infarcts. The lipid phagocytes are later replaced by a cellular reaction of astrocytes. Vessels in surrounding areas remain patent but are collagenised. Distribution of spinal cord lesions may be related to vascular supply. There is still uncertainty regarding the aetiology of decompression sickness damage to the spinal cord.\nDysbaric osteonecrosis lesions are typically bilateral and usually occur at both ends of the femur and at the proximal end of the humerus. Symptoms are usually only present when a joint surface is involved, which typically does not occur until a long time after the causative exposure to a hyperbaric environment. The initial damage is attributed to the formation of bubbles, and one episode can be sufficient; however, incidence is sporadic and generally associated with relatively long periods of hyperbaric exposure and aetiology is uncertain. Early identification of lesions by radiography is not possible, but over time, areas of radiographic opacity develop in association with the damaged bone.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis of decompression sickness relies almost entirely on clinical presentation, as there are no laboratory tests that can incontrovertibly confirm or reject the diagnosis. Various blood tests have been proposed, but they are not specific for decompression sickness, they are of uncertain utility and are not in general use.\nDecompression sickness should be suspected if any of the symptoms associated with the condition occur following a drop in pressure, in particular, within 24 hours of diving. In 1995, 95% of all cases reported to Divers Alert Network had shown symptoms within 24 hours. This window can be extended to 36 hours for ascent to altitude and 48 hours for prolonged exposure to altitude following diving. An alternative diagnosis should be suspected if severe symptoms begin more than six hours following decompression without an altitude exposure or if any symptom occurs more than 24 hours after surfacing. The diagnosis is confirmed if the symptoms are relieved by recompression. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can frequently identify bubbles in DCS, they are not as good at determining the diagnosis as a proper history of the event and description of the symptoms.\nTest of pressure.\nThere is no gold standard for diagnosis, and DCI experts are rare. Most of the chambers open to treatment of recreational divers and reporting to Diver's Alert Network see fewer than 10 cases per year, making it difficult for the attending doctors to develop experience in diagnosis. A method used by commercial diving supervisors when considering whether to recompress as first aid when they have a chamber on site is known as the \"test of pressure\". The diver is checked for contraindications to recompression, and if none are present, recompressed. If the symptoms resolve or reduce during recompression, it is considered likely that a treatment schedule will be effective. The test is not entirely reliable, and both false positives and false negatives are possible, however in the commercial diving environment it is often considered worth treating when there is doubt, and very early recompression has a history of very high success rates and reduced number of treatments needed for complete resolution and minimal sequelae.\nFor pain-only symptoms of suspected decompression sickness, a technique using a blood-pressure cuff on the affected limb can give an indication of likely DCS. The cuff is inflated over the painful area, and if the pressure relieves the pain, it is likely decompression sickness. There is a high rate of false negatives, and the method is not considered reliable. A positive test can be considered to confirm a diagnosis of DCS, but a negative test does not rule it out, and the results of a pressure cuff test do predict the rate of resolution of\nsymptoms during recompression treatment.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nSymptoms of DCS and arterial gas embolism can be virtually indistinguishable. The most reliable way to tell the difference is based on the dive profile followed, as the probability of DCS depends on the duration of exposure and the magnitude of pressure, whereas AGE depends entirely on the performance of the ascent. In many cases, it is not possible to distinguish between the two, but as the treatment is the same in such cases, it does not usually matter.\nOther conditions which may be confused include skin symptoms. \"Cutis marmorata\" due to DCS may be confused with skin barotrauma due to dry suit squeeze, for which no treatment is necessary. Dry suit squeeze produces lines of redness with possible bruising where the skin was pinched between folds of the suit, while the mottled effect of \"cutis marmorata\" is usually on skin where there is subcutaneous fat, and has no linear pattern.\nTransient episodes of severe neurological incapacitation with rapid spontaneous recovery shortly after a dive may be attributed to hypothermia, but may actually be symptomatic of short-term CNS involvement due to bubbles which form a short-term gas embolism, then resolve, but which may leave residual problems which may cause relapses. These cases are thought to be underdiagnosed.\nInner ear decompression sickness (IEDCS) can be confused with inner ear barotrauma (IEBt), alternobaric vertigo, caloric vertigo and reverse squeeze. A history of difficulty in equalising the ears during the dive makes ear barotrauma more likely, but does not always eliminate the possibility of inner ear DCS, which is usually associated with deep, mixed gas dives with decompression stops. Both conditions may exist concurrently, and it can be difficult to distinguish whether a person has IEDCS, IEBt, or both.\nNumbness and tingling are associated with spinal DCS, but can also be caused by pressure on nerves (compression neurapraxia). In DCS the numbness or tingling is generally confined to one or a series of dermatomes, while pressure on a nerve tends to produce characteristic areas of numbness associated with the specific nerve on only one side of the body distal to the pressure point. A loss of strength or function is likely to be a medical emergency. A loss of feeling that lasts more than a minute or two indicates a need for immediate medical attention. It is only partial sensory changes, or paraesthesias, where this distinction between trivial and more serious injuries applies.\nLarge areas of numbness with associated weakness or paralysis, especially if a whole limb is affected, are indicative of probable brain involvement and require urgent medical attention. Paraesthesias or weakness involving a dermatome indicate probable spinal cord or spinal nerve root involvement. Although it is possible that this may have other causes, such as an injured intervertebral disk, these symptoms indicate an urgent need for medical assessment. In combination with weakness, paralysis or loss of bowel or bladder control, they indicate a medical emergency.\nPrevention.\nUnderwater diving.\nTo prevent the excess formation of bubbles that can lead to decompression sickness, divers limit their ascent rate\u2014the recommended ascent rate used by popular decompression models is about per minute\u2014and follow a decompression schedule as necessary. This schedule may require the diver to ascend to a particular depth, and remain at that depth until sufficient inert gas has been eliminated from the body to allow further ascent. Each of these is termed a \"decompression stop\", and a schedule for a given bottom time and depth may contain one or more stops, or none at all. Dives that contain no decompression stops are called \"no-stop dives\", but divers usually schedule a short \"safety stop\" at , depending on the training agency or dive computer.\nThe decompression schedule may be derived from decompression tables, decompression software, or from dive computers, and these are generally based upon a mathematical model of the body's uptake and release of inert gas as pressure changes. These models, such as the B\u00fchlmann decompression algorithm, are modified to fit empirical data and provide a decompression schedule for a given depth and dive duration using a specified breathing gas mixture.\nSince divers on the surface after a dive may still have excess inert gas in their bodies, decompression from any subsequent dive before this excess is eliminated needs to modify the schedule to take account of the residual gas load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter allowable time under water without obligatory decompression stops, or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.\nDecompression time can be significantly shortened by breathing mixtures containing much less inert gas during the decompression phase of the dive (or pure oxygen at stops in of water or less). The reason is that the inert gas outgases at a rate proportional to the difference between the partial pressure of inert gas in the diver's body and its partial pressure in the breathing gas; whereas the likelihood of bubble formation depends on the difference between the inert gas partial pressure in the diver's body and the ambient pressure. Reduction in decompression requirements can also be gained by breathing a nitrox mix during the dive, since less nitrogen will be taken into the body than during the same dive done on air.\nFollowing a decompression schedule does not completely protect against DCS. The algorithms used are designed to reduce the probability of DCS to a very low level, but do not reduce it to zero. The mathematical implications of all current decompression models are that provided that no tissue is ingassing, longer decompression stops will decrease decompression risk, or at worst not increase it. Efficient decompression requires the diver to ascend fast enough to establish as high a decompression gradient, in as many tissues, as safely possible, without provoking the development of symptomatic bubbles. This is facilitated by the highest acceptably safe oxygen partial pressure in the breathing gas, and avoiding gas changes that could cause counterdiffusion bubble formation or growth. The development of schedules that are both safe and efficient has been complicated by the large number of variables and uncertainties, including personal variation in response under varying environmental conditions and workload, attributed to variations of body type, fitness and other risk factors.\nExposure to altitude.\nOne of the most significant breakthroughs in the prevention of altitude DCS is oxygen pre-breathing. Breathing pure oxygen significantly reduces the nitrogen loads in body tissues by reducing the partial pressure of nitrogen in the lungs, which induces diffusion of nitrogen from the blood into the breathing gas, and this effect eventually lowers the concentration of nitrogen in the other tissues of the body. If continued for long enough, and without interruption, this provides effective protection upon exposure to low-barometric pressure environments. However, breathing pure oxygen during flight alone (ascent, en route, descent) does not decrease the risk of altitude DCS as the time required for ascent is generally not sufficient to significantly desaturate the slower tissues.\nPure aviator oxygen, which has moisture removed to prevent freezing of valves at altitude, is readily available and routinely used in general aviation mountain flying and at high altitudes. Most small general aviation aircraft are not pressurized; therefore, oxygen use is an FAA requirement at higher altitudes.\nAlthough pure oxygen pre-breathing is an effective method to protect against altitude DCS, it is logistically complicated and expensive for the protection of civil aviation flyers, either commercial or private. Therefore, it is currently used only by military flight crews and astronauts for protection during high-altitude and space operations. It is also used by flight test crews involved with certifying aircraft, and may also be used for high-altitude parachute jumps.\nAstronauts aboard the International Space Station preparing for extra-vehicular activity (EVA) \"camp out\" at low atmospheric pressure, , spending eight sleeping hours in the Quest airlock chamber before their spacewalk. During the EVA they breathe 100% oxygen in their spacesuits, which operate at , although research has examined the possibility of using 100% O2 at in the suits to lessen the pressure reduction, and hence the risk of DCS.\nTreatment.\nRecompression on air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909. Evidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS. Recompression is normally carried out in a recompression chamber. At a dive site, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression.\nOxygen first aid has been used as an emergency treatment for diving injuries for years. Particularly if given within the first four hours of surfacing, it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as decreases the number of recompression treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit diving rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and could be used as a means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.\nIt is beneficial to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration. It is no longer recommended to administer aspirin, unless advised to do so by medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.\nFirst aid.\nAll cases of decompression sickness should be treated initially with the highest available concentration of oxygen until hyperbaric oxygen therapy (100% oxygen delivered in a hyperbaric chamber) can be provided. Mild cases of the \"bends\" and some skin symptoms may disappear during descent from high altitude; however, it is recommended that these cases still be evaluated. Neurological symptoms, pulmonary symptoms, and mottled or marbled skin lesions should be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy if seen within 10 to 14 days of development. Early recompression has a history of better outcomes and less treatment being needed.\nNormobaric oxygen administered at as close to 100% as practicable is known to be beneficial based on observed bubble reduction and symptom resolution. For this reason, diver training in oxygen administration, and a system for administering a high percentage of inspired oxygen at quantities sufficient for plausible evacuation scenarios, is desirable. Where oxygenation may be compromised the administration rate should be adjusted to ensure that the best practicable supplementation is maintained until supplies can be replenished.\nThere is no need for air breaks during oxygen first aid as the partial pressure is too for acute oxygen toxicity, and the duration is too short for pulmonary toxicity to develop except in exceptional cases. During a prolonged evacuation from a remote place, sufficient air breaks will naturally occur while eating, drinking and taking bathroom breaks.\nA horizontal position is preferable during evacuation if possible, with the recovery position recommended for unconscious divers, as there is evidence that inert gas washout is improved in horizontal subjects, and that large arterial bubbles tend to distribute towards the head in upright positions. A head down position is thought to be harmful in DCS.\nOral hydration is often used if the person is fully conscious; fluids are typically isotonic, without alcohol, carbonation or caffeine, as diving is known to cause dehydration, and rehydration is known to reduce post-dive venous gas emboli. Intravascular rehydration is commonly used if trained medical professionals are present. Glucose-free isotonic crystalloid solutions are preferred. Case evidence shows that aggressive rehydration can be life-saving in severe cases.\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), along with hyperbaric oxygen, improves the rate of recovery. The most commonly used NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen; all available over the counter in most countries. Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is generally not considered an NSAID because it has only minor anti-inflammatory activity. Corticosteroids, pentoxyphylline, aspirin, lidocaine and nicergoline have been used in early management of DCS, but there is insufficient evidence on their effectiveness.\nDivers are often kept comfortably warm, as warmth can help eliminate gas more quickly, but overheating aggravates neurological injury.\nDelay of recompression.\nObservational evidence shows that outcomes after recompression are likely to be better after immediate recompression, which is only possible when on-site recompression is possible, although the 2004 workshop on decompression came to the conclusion that for cases with mild symptoms, a delay before recompression is unlikely to cause any worsening of long-term outcomes.\nIn more serious cases, recompression should be done as soon as safely possible. There is some evidence that delays longer than six hours result in slower or less complete recovery, and the number of treatments required may be increased.\nTransport of a symptomatic diver.\nExposing a case of decompression sickness to reduced ambient pressure will cause the bubbles to expand if not constrained by a rigid local tissue environment. This can aggravate the symptoms and should be avoided if reasonably practicable. If a diver with DCS is transported by air, cabin pressure should be kept as close to sea level atmospheric pressure as possible, preferably not more than 150 m, either by cabin pressurisation or by remaining at low altitude throughout the flight. The risk of deterioration at higher altitudes must be considered against the risk of deterioration if not transported. Some divers with symptoms or signs of mild decompression sickness may be evacuated by pressurised commercial airliner for further treatment after a surface interval of at least 24 hours. The 2004 workshop considered it unlikely for this to cause a worse outcome. Most experience has been for short flights of less than two hours. There is little known about the effects of longer flights. Where possible, pre-flight and in-flight oxygen breathing at the highest available percentage is considered best practice. Similar precautions apply to surface transport through higher altitudes.\nIn-water recompression.\nRecompression and hyperbaric oxygen administered in a recompression chamber is recognised as the definitive treatment for DCI, but when there is no readily available access to a suitable hyperbaric chamber, and if symptoms are significant or progressing, in-water recompression (IWR) with oxygen is a medically recognised option where a group of divers including the symptomatic diver already have relevant training and equipment that provides a sufficient understanding of the associated risks and allows the involved parties to collectively accept responsibility for a decision to proceed with IWR.\nIn-water recompression (IWR) or underwater oxygen treatment is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness by returning the diver underwater to help the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a procedure that exposes the diver to significant risk which should be compared with the risk associated with the other available options. Some authorities recommend that it is only to be used when the time to travel to the nearest recompression chamber is too long to save the victim's life; others take a more pragmatic approach, and accept that in some circumstances IWR is the best available option. The risks may not be justified for case of mild symptoms likely to resolve spontaneously, or for cases where the diver is likely to be unsafe in the water, but in-water recompression may be justified in cases where severe outcomes are likely, if conducted by a competent and suitably equipped team.\nCarrying out in-water recompression when there is a nearby recompression chamber or without suitable equipment and training is never a desirable option. The risk of the procedure is due to the diver suffering from DCS being seriously ill and may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing while under water. Any one of these events is likely to result in the diver drowning or asphyxiating or suffering further injury during a subsequent rescue to the surface. This risk can be reduced by improving airway security by using surface supplied gas and a helmet or full-face mask.\nSeveral schedules have been published for in-water recompression treatment, but little data on their efficacy is available.\nThe decision of whether or not to attempt IWR is dependent on identifying the diver whose condition is serious enough to justify the risk, but whose clinical condition does not indicate that the risk is unacceptable. The risk may not be justified for mild DCI, if spontaneous recovery is probable, whether the diver is recompressed or not, and surface oxygen is indicated for these cases. However, in these cases the risk of recompression is also low, and early abandonment is also unlikely to cause further harm.\nContraindications.\nSome signs of decompression illness, which suggest a risk of permanent injury, are nevertheless considered contraindications for IWR. Hearing loss and vertigo displayed in isolation with no other symptoms of DCI can have been caused by inner ear barotrauma rather than DCI, and inner ear barotrauma is generally considered a contraindication for recompression. Even when caused by DCI, vertigo can make in-water treatment hazardous if accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A diver with a deteriorating level of consciousness or with a persisting reduced level of consciousness should also not be recompressed in-water, nor should a diver who does not want to go back down, or with a history of oxygen toxicity in the preceding dives, or any physical injury or incapacitation which may make the procedure unsafe.\nDefinitive treatment.\nThe duration of recompression treatment depends on the severity of symptoms, the dive history, the type of recompression therapy used and the patient's response to the treatment. One of the more frequently used treatment schedules is the US Navy Table 6, which provides hyperbaric oxygen therapy with a maximum pressure equivalent to of seawater (2.8 bar PO2) for a total time under pressure of 288 minutes, of which 240 minutes are on oxygen and the balance are air breaks to minimise the possibility of oxygen toxicity.\nA multiplace chamber is the preferred facility for treatment of decompression sickness as it allows direct physical access to the patient by medical personnel, but monoplace chambers are more widely available and should be used for treatment if a multiplace chamber is not available or transportation would cause significant delay in treatment, as the interval between onset of symptoms and recompression is important to the quality of recovery. It may be necessary to modify the optimum treatment schedule to allow use of a monoplace chamber, but this is usually better than delaying treatment. A US Navy treatment table 5 can be safely performed without air breaks if a built-in breathing system is not available. In most cases, the patient can be adequately treated in a monoplace chamber at the receiving hospital.\nAltitude decompression sickness.\nTreatment and management may vary depending on the grade or form of decompression sickness and the treating facility or organization. First aid at altitude is oxygen at the highest practicable concentration and the earliest and largest practicable reduction in cabin altitude.\nGround-level 100% oxygen therapy is suggested for 2 hours following type-1 decompression sickness that occurs at altitude, if it resolves upon descent. In more severe cases, hyperbaric oxygen therapy following standard recompression protocols is indicated. Decompression sickness in aviation most commonly follows flights in non-pressurized aircraft, flights with cabin pressure fluctuations, or in individuals who fly after diving. Cases have also been reported after the use of altitude chambers. These are relatively rare clinical events.\nPrognosis.\nImmediate treatment with 100% oxygen, followed by recompression in a hyperbaric chamber, will in most cases result in no long-term effects. However, permanent long-term injury from DCS is possible. Three-month follow-ups on diving accidents reported to DAN in 1987 showed 14.3% of the 268 divers surveyed had ongoing symptoms of Type II DCS, and 7% from Type I DCS. Long-term follow-ups showed similar results, with 16% having permanent neurological sequelae. Hyperbaric oxygen has also had generally successful results in treatment of hypobaric decompression sickness.\nLong-term effects are dependent on both the initial injury and treatment. While almost all cases will resolve more quickly with treatment, milder cases may resolve adequately over time without recompression, where the damage is minor and the damage is not significantly aggravated by lack of treatment. In some cases the cost, inconvenience, and risk to the patient may make it appropriate not to evacuate to a hyperbaric treatment facility. These cases should be assessed by a specialist in diving medicine, which can generally be done remotely by telephone or internet.\nFor joint pain, the likely tissues affected depend on the symptoms, and the urgency of hyperbaric treatment will depend largely on the tissues involved.\nEpidemiology.\nA fundamental difference between DCS caused by decompression from hyperbaric exposure and from hypobaric exposure, is that in the first category the affected person develops symptoms while returning to normal conditions, usually after an exposure which leaves tissues in varying states of supersaturation, and treatment typically requires hypobaric pressures to alleviate symptoms, while the second category is usually decompression from saturation at normal conditions, and the symptoms occur during an upward excursion from those conditions, and a return to normal conditions will of itself provide a certain amount of therapy.\nDCS from hyperbaric exposure.\nThe incidence of decompression sickness in surface oriented divers is rare, estimated at 2.8 to 4 cases per 10,000 dives, with the risk 2.6 times greater for males than females. DCS affects approximately 1,000 U.S. scuba divers per year. In 1999, the Divers Alert Network (DAN) created \"Project Dive Exploration\" to collect data on dive profiles and incidents. From 1998 to 2002, they recorded 50,150 dives, from which 28 recompressions were required\u00a0\u2013 although these will almost certainly contain incidents of arterial gas embolism (AGE)\u00a0\u2013 a rate of about 0.05%.\nAccording to Divers Alert Network the number of recreational divers who experience decompression sickness at some time is less than 1%, and the risk decreases with greater experience, suggesting a greater level of skill is more important than a higher exposure rate and lower physical fitness due to age.\nIt is difficult to assess decompression risk in recent saturation decompressions as the data is generally not available; however, it is known to be very uncommon since 2000, with some operators not having any cases in a 10-year period, while in the early days of commercial saturation diving, it was in the order of 1%. Saturation decompression is most likely to produce joint pain symptoms in the late stages of decompression. Venous gas bubbles are generally detected without symptomatic DCS, but this has also become rare.\nAround 2013, Honduras had the highest number of decompression-related deaths and disabilities in the world, caused by unsafe practices in lobster diving among the indigenous Miskito people, who face great economic pressures. At that time, it was estimated that in the country over 2000 divers had been injured and 300 others had died since the 1970s.\nDCS from hypobaric exposure.\nAltitude DCS can occur as a consequence of unpressurized aircraft flights, flights experiencing severe cabin pressure fluctuations, flying shortly after diving, and exposure to low pressure in hypobaric chambers. Populations at high risk for altitude decompression sickness include :\nThe most common manifestation of altitude DCS is pain in the shoulders caused by gas bubbles, followed by elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in 60 to 70% of all reported altitude DCS cases. Neurological decompression sickness comprises a very low proportion of DCS caused by hypobaric exposure, but it is more likely to involve the brain than the spinal cord. Symptoms may range from slow thought processes to more severe confusion, aphasia, unresponsiveness or permanent cognitive capacity reduction.\nLess than 13% of cases occurred in exposures lower than 25,000 feet. Risk is increased by even mild hyperbaric exposure within the preceding 24 hours, and reduced by oxygen prebreathing before flight. Repetitive exposures, rapid altitude increases, and long exposure times increase risk.\nSulaiman et al 1997 found a distinct trend toward increased susceptibility to altitude decompression sickness with increasing age, particularly in subjects over 42 years old. Simulated EVA exposure tests by NASA showed a strong correlation between detectable precordial bubbles and symptomatic DCS, and between repeated exposures and DCS.\nExercise, altitude and the ratio of oxygen pre-breathing to exposure time were found to be the most significant risk factors. The effects of physiological factors such as age, physique, fitness, presence of PFO, gender, and hydration status in a hypobaric environment on DCS risk remain unknown due to a lack of relevant studies.\nTimeline.\nThe history of decompression sickness originates in the observation that rapid decompression can produce signs and symptoms of characteristic disorders, which are to a significant extent reproducible within a fairly broad range. Once this had been established by observation, the efforts to explain the etiology followed, as did experimental work intended to provide treatment and reduce risk. As the technology of diving developed, greater exposure to decompression risk and symptomatic disorders followed, and as there are strong economic incentives to the use of hyperbaric and hypobaric workplace exposures, concern for the health and safety of persons at risk encouraged further research.\nSociety and culture.\nEconomics.\nIn the United States, it is common for medical insurance not to cover treatment for the bends that is the result of recreational diving. This is because scuba diving is considered an elective and \"high-risk\" activity, and treatment for decompression sickness is expensive. A typical stay in a recompression chamber will easily cost several thousand dollars, even before emergency transportation is included. As of September 2023, a number of hyperbaric chambers in the US are turning divers with decompression sickness away, and only treating more profitable scheduled cases. The number of hyperbaric medical facilities in the US is estimated at about 1500, of which 67 are treating diving accidents, according to Divers Alert Network. Many facilities only provide hyperbaric treatment for wound care for economic reasons. Emergency hyperbaric services are more expensive to train and staff, and liability is increased.\nIn the United Kingdom, treatment of DCS is provided by the National Health Service. This may occur either at a specialised facility or at a hyperbaric centre based within a general hospital.\nOther animals.\nAnimals may also contract DCS, especially those caught in nets and rapidly brought to the surface. It has been documented in loggerhead turtles and likely in prehistoric marine animals as well. Modern reptiles are susceptible to DCS, and there is some evidence that marine mammals such as cetaceans and seals may also be affected. AW Carlsen has suggested that the presence of a right-left shunt in the reptilian heart may account for the predisposition in the same way as a patent foramen ovale does in humans.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While the film has no audible dialog, it was released with a synchronized musical score with sound effects using the Movietone sound system. The film is based upon the 1922 play \"Seventh Heaven\", by Austin Strong and was adapted for the screen by Benjamin Glazer. \"7th Heaven\" was initially released as a standard silent film in May 1927. On September 10, 1927, Fox Film Corporation re-released the film with a synchronized Movietone soundtrack with a musical score and sound effects.\nUpon its release, \"7th Heaven\" was a critical and commercial success and helped to establish Fox Film Corporation as a major studio. It was among the first three films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture (then called \"Outstanding Picture\") at the 1st Academy Awards held on May 16, 1929. Janet Gaynor won the first Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in the film (she also won for her performances in 1927's \"\" and 1928's \"Street Angel\"). Director Frank Borzage also won the first Academy Award for Best Director while screenwriter Benjamin Glazer won the first Academy Award for Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay).\nIn 1995, \"7th Heaven\" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". The film entered the public domain in the United States in 2023.\nPlot.\nIn the early 1910s, Chico works in the sewers of Paris. He expresses his desire to be a street sweeper to work above ground and light candles at a nearby church. After a meeting with the church's priest, Chico gets the recommendation he needs for the street sweeping job.\nDiane is a young prostitute living with her abusive sister Nana. When news arrives that their uncle and aunt have returned with a fortune, Nana particularly hopes they will provide more comfortable accommodations. But when the uncle asks Diane directly whether she and her sister have kept \"clean and decent\", the look on her face confirms his worst suspicions and, refusing to take them home, disowns them. Nana, furious at Diane for revealing the truth, begins to beat her. As Diane tries to escape on the street, Chico steps in to rescue her.\nFollowing a brief flirtation between Diane and Chico, Nana returns with the police intending to arrest Diane. Once again, Chico intervenes, asserting that Diane is not a prostitute but his wife. Despite initial skepticism, the police refrain from arresting Diane but ask for Chico's address to verify the marriage. Concerned about potential repercussions for lying, Chico fears losing his job as a streetsweeper. To provide an alibi, he suggests Diane move in with him. After ensuring she's not being exploited, Diane agrees to Chico's proposal.\nSoon afterwards, the police visit Chico's apartment for further investigation, and their strategy succeeds, absolving them both of suspicion. With no more reason to stay, Diane prepares to leave, feeling disheartened after having grown fond of Chico and his airy sixth floor walkup flat. When Chico offers her to stay, she joyfully accepts, feeling that Chico is a godsend. As they spend more time together, they quickly fall in love, and decide to marry genuinely.\nNews of World War I reaching France arrives, prompting the couple to hold an unofficial wedding in their apartment, with God as their sole witness. Chico is swiftly recruited, forcing him to depart for the battlefield. Upon his departure, a resentful Nana returns, deriding Diane for her marriage and attempts to assault her once more, only to be forced out by Diane fighting back with newfound bravery thanks to Chico's support.\nWhile Chico fights in the war, Diane finds work at a munitions factory. During a battle, Chico is gravely wounded and believes he's dying. When Diane is told that Chico has been officially declared dead, she is devastated. Yet once the war ends, Chico returns home, his death having been wrongly reported, but he is now blind.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Janet Gaynor as Diane\nMusic.\nThe film featured a theme song entitled \"Diane\" which was composed by Ern\u00f6 Rap\u00e9e and Lew Pollack.\nProduction notes.\nThe Broadway play upon which the film is based starred George Gaul and Helen Menken and ran at the Booth Theatre for 704 performances.\nWhen the play was adapted for the screen, Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell were cast in the lead roles. The pairing proved to be so popular, the two went on to star in 11 more films together and were dubbed \"America's Favorite Lovebirds\".\n\"7th Heaven\" features the song \"Diane\" by Ern\u00f6 Rap\u00e9e and Lew Pollack, who wrote the song specifically for the film. The song is included on the re-released version of the film.\nReception.\n\"7th Heaven\" initially premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles replacing another Fox melodrama \"What Price Glory?\", which had been playing since November 1926. A second opening was held at the Sam H. Harris Theatre in New York City on May 25. Both openings earned a total of $14,500. A series of Movietone shorts featuring Ben Bernie and his Orchestra, Gertrude Lawrence, Raquel Meller, and Charles \"Chic\" Sale preceded the film.\nUpon its release, \"7th Heaven\" was a critical and commercial success. \"The New York Times\" critic stated that the film \"grips your interest from the very beginning and even though the end is melodramatic you are glad that the sympathetic but self-satisfied Chico is brought back to his heart-broken Diane.\" The critic also praised Borzage's direction, stating that the director \"has given it all that he could put through the medium of the camera.\" The film went on to play for 19 weeks in New York City and for 22 weeks in Los Angeles.\nDue to the film's success and the success of other Fox films featuring sound elements (\"Sunrise\", \"What Price Glory?\"), the studio re-released \"7th Heaven\" with a synchronized Movietone soundtrack, including a musical score arranged by Ern\u00f6 Rap\u00e9e and sound effects. The re-release version premiered at New York City's Roxy Theatre on September 10, 1927.\nBy 1932, \"7th Heaven\" had become the 13th-highest-grossing American silent, earning more than $2.5 million at the box office.\nRemakes and adaptations.\nA comparatively unknown 1937 remake of the film was produced as a sound feature starring Simone Simon, James Stewart, Jean Hersholt, and Gregory Ratoff, with Henry King directing. Unlike the 1927 version, the sound remake was not as financially successful.\n\"7th Heaven\" was adapted for the \"Lux Radio Theatre\" four times: October 14, 1934, with Miriam Hopkins and John Boles (the show's premiere episode); October 17, 1938, with Jean Arthur and Don Ameche; October 16, 1944, with Jennifer Jones and Van Johnson (on the show's tenth-year anniversary); and finally on March 26, 1951, with Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, recreating their original roles.\nA television adaptation was aired on October 26, 1953, on the anthology series \"Broadway Television Theatre\". The episode stars Hurd Hatfield and Geraldine Brooks and was directed by Robert St. Aubrey.\nOn May 26, 1955, a stage musical version of the film opened at the ANTA Theatre starring Gloria DeHaven and Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n. It closed on July 2, 1955, after 44 performances.\nHome media.\nOn December 9, 2008, \"7th Heaven\" was included in the \"Murnau, Borzage and Fox\" DVD box set released by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.\nIn popular culture.\nChinese writer-director Yuan Muzhi's 1937 film \"Street Angel\" has been cited as being influenced by elements of \"7th Heaven\" and another Frank Borzage film \"Street Angel\" (1928).\nThe theatrical poster for \"7th Heaven\" is displayed on the wall of the student Watanabe's lodgings in the oldest surviving film by the Japanese director Yasujir\u014d Ozu, \"Days of Youth: A Student Romance\" (\"Gakusei Romansu: Wakaki Hi\", 1929).\nFilmmaker Damien Chazelle has said the ending of his 2016 musical \"La La Land\" was inspired by the ending of \"7th Heaven\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A Victorian-era bestseller, it is remembered chiefly for its elaborate and implausible plot centering on infidelity and double identities. There have been numerous stage and film adaptations.\nThe much-quoted line \"Gone! And never called me mother!\" (variant: \"Dead! Dead! And never called me mother!\") does not appear in the book; both variants come from later stage adaptations.\nThe book was originally serialised in \"The New Monthly Magazine\" between January 1860 and September 1861, and it was issued as a three-volume novel on 19 September 1861.\nPlot summary.\nLady Isabel Vane, a beautiful and refined young woman, is distraught when her beloved father dies suddenly. The earldom and all property are bequeathed to a distant relation, leaving Isabel homeless and penniless. With no other options, she marries hard-working lawyer Archibald Carlyle, who buys her former home, called East Lynne.\nCarlyle's elder sister Cornelia comes to live at East Lynne. She hates the marriage and, by taking over the household, makes Isabel's life miserable. Carlyle, a kind man, had previously been friendly with a local lady, Barbara Hare, who had hoped to marry him. Suspicious of the relationship, Isabel leaves her husband and their infant children to elope with aristocratic but poor Captain Francis Levison. However, once abroad with Levison, Isabel realises he has no intention of marrying her even though she has borne their illegitimate child. He deserts her.\nIsabel's cousin, Lord Mount Severn, visits her in Europe and offers to support her. She learns from him that her husband was not unfaithful. On her way back to England, there is a train accident, and Isabel's baby is killed and Isabel, badly injured, is reported dead. Isabel, in disguise and under a new name, takes the position of governess in the household of her former husband and his new wife (Barbara Hare), allowing her to be close to her children.\nThis situation becomes a source of great misery, however, as the little boy William dies of tuberculosis. Carlyle stands for Parliament, as does Sir Francis Levison, Isabel's seducer. It transpires that under the name Thorn, Levison had been guilty of the murder of a Mr. Hallijohn. But Richard Hare, the brother of Barbara, had been falsely accused of that murder and goes on the run.\nWhen the facts eventually come to light, there is a dramatic trial involving Hallijohn's daughter Afy as a reluctant witness. \nThe pressure of maintaining a fa\u00e7ade (wearing blue glasses, adopting a foreign accent) to disguise her identity and being constantly reminded that her husband has moved on physically weakens Isabel. On her deathbed, she tells all to Carlyle, who forgives her.\nAdaptations.\nThere have been multiple adaptations for stage, radio, films and television. \n\"East Lynne\" has been adapted for the stage many times; the play was so popular that stock companies performed the play whenever they needed guaranteed revenue. It became so common that theatres stuck with a badly received play would assuage audiences with the hopeful promise, \"Next week, \"East Lynne\"!\", which eventually became a catchphrase in comedies and cartoons, often as a sign outside a theatre. The play was staged so often that critic Sally Mitchell estimates that some version was seen by audiences in either England or North America every week for more than 40 years.\nThe \"Next week, \"East Lynne\"!\" catchphrase is mentioned in the 1936 film \"Libeled Lady\" in a scene with Jean Harlow and Spencer Tracy.\nStage adaptations.\nThe novel was first staged as \"Edith, or The Earl's Daughter\" in New York in 1861 and under its own name on 26 January 1863 in Brooklyn; by March of that year, \"three competing versions were drawing crowds to New York theaters.\" The most successful version was written by Clifton W. Tayleur for actress Lucille Western, who was paid $350 a night for her performance as Isabel Vane. Western starred in \"East Lynne\" for the next 10 years. At least nine adaptations were made in all, not including plays such as \"The Marriage Bells\" that \"used a different title for the sake of some copyright protection.\" The work was revived on Broadway in 1926 in a production directed by James Light.\nTelevision.\nIn the 1970s, a TV dramatisation was broadcast from the City Varieties Theatre in Leeds, with the audience all in Victorian costume and Queen Victoria in the royal box. The famous TV host of \"The Good Old Days\", Leonard Sachs, introduced the proceedings. \nThe story was filmed in 1982, in a BBC made-for-television production starring amongst Martin Shaw, Gemma Craven, Lisa Eichhorn, Jane Asher, Annette Crosbie and Tim Woodward.\nRadio.\nA radio serial was produced in Australia in 1939 with Queenie Ashton (as Lady Isabel) and Ronald Morse (as Francis Levison).\nA radio adaptation in seven parts was made for BBC Radio 4 by Michael Bakewell, with Rosemary Leach narrating as Mrs. Wood, first broadcast in 1987.\nOther adaptations.\nAs the more melodramatic aspects of the story became dated, several parodies were performed, including \"East Lynne in Bugville\" with Pearl White (1914), Mack Sennet's \"East Lynne with Variations\" (1917) and in 1931 the comedy \"East Lynne on the Western Front\", in which British soldiers in World War I stage a burlesque version of the story.\nCritical assessment.\nSome argue that the novel champions middle classes over the lower orders; others, however, find this claim \"too simplistic\" and argue that the novel \"highlights the shortfalls inherent to bourgeois masculinity.\" Sally Mitchell argues that the novel simultaneously upholds and undermines middle-class values. \nOther critics include the late 19th century English novelist George Gissing, who read the book whilst staying in Rome in March 1898 and wrote in his diary that it was \"not at all a bad book, of its sort.\" Perhaps the most practical assessment came from one who produced the play many times, actor and theater manager Tod Slaughter: \"No other play in its time has ever been more maligned, more burlesqued, more ridiculed, or consistently made more money.\"\nLegacy.\nThe town of East Lynne, Missouri took its name from the novel.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written by former Chicago reporters Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur, it was first produced in 1928 and has been adapted for the cinema several times. The play entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.\nPlot.\nThe play's single set is the dingy press room of Chicago's Criminal Courts Building, overlooking the gallows behind the Cook County Jail. Reporters from most of the city's newspapers are passing the time with poker and pungent wisecracks about the news of the day. Soon they will witness the hanging of Earl Williams, a white man and supposed Communist revolutionary convicted of killing a black policeman. Hildy Johnson, cocky star reporter for the \"Examiner\", is late. He appears only to say goodbye; he is quitting to get a respectable job and be married. Suddenly the reporters hear that Earl Williams has escaped from the jail. All but Hildy stampede out for more information. As Hildy tries to decide how to react, Williams comes in through the window. He tells Hildy he is no revolutionary, and that he shot the police officer by accident. The reporter realizes this bewildered, harmless little man was railroaded \u2014 just to help the crooked mayor and sheriff pick up enough black votes to win re-election. It is the story of a lifetime. Hildy helps Williams hide inside a roll-top desk. His daunting challenge now is to get Williams out of the building to a safe place for an interview before rival reporters or trigger-happy policemen discover him. Hildy has no choice but to ask for help from Walter Burns, managing editor of the \"Examiner\" \u2014 a devious tyrant who would do just about anything to keep Hildy with the newspaper.\nCast and characters.\n\"The Front Page\" was produced by Jed Harris and directed by George S. Kaufman, with settings by Raymond Sovey. It opened at the Times Square Theatre, New York City, on August 14, 1928, and ran 278 performances before closing in April 1929.\nSignificance.\nThe authors' expert plotting and rapid-fire, streetwise dialogue delighted audiences and made their play an instant classic. Hecht and MacArthur strongly influenced many other American comic writers, especially in Hollywood. In the 1970s, film producer Dore Schary told film historian David Bordwell that \"The Front Page\" influenced studio writers and directors in the 1930s. The play popularized the image of American journalists as fast-talking, wisecracking \"hard-boiled\" types, excessively fond of alcohol and hard living in general, who would go to any lengths to get a story on the front page of their newspapers.\nThe newspapers are modeled on the City News Bureau of Chicago (where MacArthur had worked), \"Chicago Daily News\" (where Hecht was a reporter), and William Randolph Hearst's \"Chicago's American\". The character Earl Williams is loosely based on \"Terrible\" Tommy O'Connor. The character of Williams also was at least partially based on the case of Thomas Mooney, a radical leftist sentenced to death on the basis of questionable evidence. Walter Burns is a thinly disguised caricature of Hearst editor Walter Howey. The corrupt Mayor of Chicago seems to have been based on William Hale Thompson, who, like the mayor in the play, depended in part upon black voters to stay in office. Commenting on the play's seeming veracity, \"New York Times\" theater critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, \"The authors and directors have packed an evening with loud, rapid, coarse and unfailing entertainment. No one who has ground his heels in the grime of a police headquarters press room will complain that this argot misrepresents the gentlemen of the press.\"\nRevivals.\nThe play was restaged four more times on Broadway. The 1969\u201370 revival was the most successful of these. It was produced at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre and starred Robert Ryan and Bert Convy as Burns and Johnson, running for a total of 222 performances. The 1946 revival was directed by Charles MacArthur and ran for 79 performances. The 1986\u201387 revival was produced at the Vivian Beaumont at Lincoln Center, directed by Jerry Zaks and starred Richard Thomas as Hildy and John Lithgow as Burns. This production ran for 57 performances.\nA Broadway revival opened at the Broadhurst Theatre, in a limited engagement, starting on September 20, 2016, in previews and officially on October 20. Directed by Jack O'Brien, the cast starred Nathan Lane as Walter Burns, John Slattery as Hildy Johnson, John Goodman as Sheriff Hartman, Jefferson Mays as Bensinger, Holland Taylor as Mrs. Grant, Sherie Rene Scott as Mollie Malloy, Robert Morse as Silas Pinkus, and Christopher McDonald as Murphy. The production received generally good notices, especially for Lane, and became the first show of the season to recoup and turn a profit. It received two Tony nominations: Best Featured Actor in a Play (Lane) and Best Scenic Design of a Play (Douglas W. Schmidt).\nJohn Guare's theatrical adaptation of the film \"His Girl Friday\" was produced at The La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California, in 2013, directed by Christopher Ashley.\nAdaptations.\n\"The Front Page\" has been adapted for film and radio a number of times:\n\"His Girl Friday\" and \"Switching Channels\" changed the male lead Hildebrand \"Hildy\" Johnson to women, Hildegaard \"Hildy\" Johnson and Christy Colleran respectively. John Varley's 1991 science fiction novel \"Steel Beach\" takes the story \u2014 and the change of sex \u2014 to another level; the plot includes a sex-change by a male reporter named Hildy Johnson.\nThere have also been four television productions, all under the title \"The Front Page\":\nThe musical \"Windy City\" (book and lyrics by Dick Vosburgh, music by Tony Macaulay) was also based on \"The Front Page\". It premiered at the Victoria Palace Theatre, London, England on July 20, 1982 and ran for 250 performances.\nAdditionally, Hecht and MacArthur's story for the 1939 film \"Gunga Din\" recycles their basic plot of trying to dissuade someone from leaving his job, in this case Douglas Fairbanks Jr.'s character attempting to resign his post in the British army and comrades Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen conniving to prevent it.\nFilm critic Leonard Maltin describes the 1940 film \"Torrid Zone\" as a 3.5-out-of-4-star \u201cvariation on Front Page\u201d. Set among the highly competitive banana plantations of Central America, it stars James Cagney as the invaluable employee, Pat O'Brien as the amoral boss who will stop at nothing to keep him from leaving, George Tobias as a revolutionary awaiting the firing squad, and Ann Sheridan as love interest, with snappy dialogue provided by Richard Macaulay and Jerry Wald.\nThe 2013 graphic novel, \"Nemo: Heart of Ice\", by Alan Moore and Kevin O'Neill, has a prose afterword purportedly written by Hildy Johnson, who visits Lincoln Island to write about the wedding of Captain Nemo's granddaughter to the son of Robur the Conqueror.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay was by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Don Marquis, Norman Z. McLeod, and Sam Mintz.\nThe film stars Jackie Cooper in the title role, Robert Coogan, Mitzi Green and Jackie Searl. Director Norman Taurog won the Academy Award for Best Director (at age 32, he remained the youngest winner in this category until Damien Chazelle won for the 2016 film \"La La Land\"). The film also did well enough to inspire a sequel called \"Sooky\" (1931). \"Skippy\" was released on April 5, 1931, by Paramount Pictures. \nFor his performance, Cooper, at the age of nine, became the youngest person to earn an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role. The film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.\nPlot.\nSkippy (Jackie Cooper) is the feisty son of the strict Dr. Herbert Skinner (Willard Robertson) and his wife Ellen (Enid Bennett) who live in Morrisville, Indiana. Skinner forbids Skippy to play in the pauperized Shantytown, because of its filth and criminal surroundings. Regardless, Skippy and his friend Sidney (Jackie Searl) visit Shantytown, where Skippy meets a new boy named Sooky (Robert Coogan, Jackie Coogan's little brother). He saves Sooky from the bully Harley Nubbins (Donald Haines), and Skippy and Sooky become friends.\nOne day, Harley accidentally breaks his father's windshield with Skippy's yo-yo. Harley, whose father is brutish and aggressive, blames the damage on Skippy and Sooky. Mr. Nubbins (Jack Rube Clifford), who works as a dogcatcher, takes Sooky's dog and demands the two boys pay for the damages if they want their dog back. Skippy and Sooky gather three dollars by breaking Skippy's savings bank, but Mr. Nubbins accepts it only for his windshield. He gives them three days to obtain another three dollars for a dog license, and he threatens to kill their dog if they don't get him the money.\nSooky and Skippy spend the next two days selling bottles, lemonade and wood, and staging a performance to earn money, but Skippy's father doesn't want to lend them the remaining thirty cents. Mr. Nubbins kills the dog and Skippy blames his father. The next morning, Skippy gets a new bicycle from his father but trades it to his friend, Eloise (Mitzi Green), for her new dog. He then takes the dog to Sooky. Dr. Skinner has a change of heart and buys Sooky a licensed dog, finds his mother a job, and refrains from ordering Shantytown destroyed, instead offering assistance to its citizens. For the first time, Dr. Skinner plays with Skippy in Shantytown. There they accidentally break Mr. Nubbins' new windshield. Dr. Skinner wins a fight against Mr. Nubbins and shows he is a good father.\nProduction.\nIn the scene where the dog dies, director Norman Taurog needed to get his nephew, Jackie Cooper, to cry, so he told young Jackie he was going to kill his own dog by dragging the dog off set (with the assistance of Cooper's grandmother) and then having a security guard \"shoot\" the dog. Cooper did the scene, but despite finding the dog was not harmed, he was still hysterical for hours afterward to the point of needing a sedative.\nReception.\n\"Skippy\" received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86%, based on 7 reviews.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Van Dyke and starring Harry Carey and Edwina Booth. It is the first non-documentary film shot on location in Africa. The film is based on the book of the same name by trader and adventurer Alfred Aloysius Horn and tells of adventures on safari in Africa.\nThe film's dialogue was written by Cyril Hume. John Thomas Neville and Dale Van Every wrote the adaption. \"Trader Horn\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1931. Edwina Booth, the female lead, contracted a career-ending illness while filming in Africa, for which she later sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.\nPlot.\nThe film depicts the adventures of real-life trader and adventurer Alfred Aloysius \"Trader\" Horn (Harry Carey), while on safari in Africa. Much of the film is fictional, including the discovery of a white blonde jungle queen, the lost daughter of a missionary (Edwina Booth). A scene based upon a genuine incident occurs in which Carey as Horn swings on a vine across a river filled with genuine crocodiles, one of which comes very close to taking his leg off.\nProduction.\nMany accidents and delays occurred during filming in Africa. Many of the crew, including the director W.S. Van Dyke, contracted malaria. An African crewman fell into a river and was eaten by a crocodile, while another was killed by a charging rhinoceros. The rhinoceros was captured on film and the scene was used in the final print. Swarms of many insects, including locusts and tse-tse flies, were common and cast and crew were perpetually bitten or stung.\nFemale lead Edwina Booth became infected, probably with malaria or schistosomiasis during filming. It took six years for her to fully recover from this and other conditions she endured. She retired from acting soon after and sued Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The case was settled out of court. A sound crew, sent halfway through filming, were unable to produce good quality work. This resulted in most of the dialogue sequences being reshot at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. This caused rumours that the entire production had been filmed there, so most of this footage was cut from the final release. Many animal scenes were filmed in Tecate, Mexico, by a second unit to avoid the American laws on the ethical treatment of animals. For example, lions were reportedly starved to promote vicious attacks on hyenas, monkeys and deer.\nRelease.\nThe film earned $1,642,000 in rentals in the United States and Canada and $1,953,000 overseas for a total of $3,595,000. Subsequent reissues added a further $596,000 bringing its total worldwide rental to $4,191,000 and a profit to $1.3 million.\nOther adaptations.\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer remade the film, released in 1973. Although filmed on the MGM backlot, the 1973 remake used tinted stock footage from the 1931 film. A sexploitation parody film titled \"Trader Hornee\" was released in 1970. \"Trader Horn\" is the subject of a 2009 documentary, \"Trader Horn: The Journey Back\" featuring Harry Carey Jr.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay was adapted by Edwin J. Burke from the 1928 novel by Vi\u00f1a Delmar and the 1930 play by Delmar and Brian Marlowe. The plot follows the courtship and marriage of two young, working-class people and the misunderstandings that result from their not having learned to trust and communicate with one another. The film propelled then-unknown actors Eilers and Dunn to stardom. It was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay.\nPlot.\nDorothy Haley and Edna Driggs are store models, first seen in bridal clothes at their job one afternoon. After work Dorothy fends off her boss, who wants to take her for a ride, by claiming to be married to a prizefighter. The girls then go to Coney Island. On the return steamboat trip, the women make a bet about attracting a certain man's attention, and Dorothy proceeds to annoy him by playing a ukulele. This man is Eddie Collins; after his initial grouchy reaction to the women, he slowly forms a connection with Dorothy and sees her home. Eddie works in a radio shop and dreams of having a shop on his own, for which he has been saving.\nEddie forgets to show up for a date and Dorothy angrily finds him in his boarding house, where they remain together until 4 a.m. Eddie walks her home but she is afraid to go up, fearing the reaction of her abusive elder brother who is her guardian. Eddie proposes marriage as a solution and Dorothy joyfully accepts. Her brother calls her a tramp and evicts her from her home. Dorothy suffers some anxiety the next day when Eddie seems to have disappeared; he then turns up, having made arrangements for a new place to live, and the two are happily married.\nTen weeks later, Dorothy confides to Edna that she is pregnant, but is reluctant to tell Eddie the news when she learns that he is ready to open his new shop, an expensive commitment. Instead she tells Eddie that she would like to return to work, to which he objects. Wrongly guessing that she really wants a larger place to live, Eddie cancels his plans for the shop in favor of a lavish new apartment and the purchase of new furnishings, increasing Dorothy's worries. By the time Eddie finally finds out he is to become a father, the two mutually misunderstand that the other is unhappy about the pregnancy, resulting in a strain on their marriage. The strain intensifies when Eddie stays out late at night to earn extra money as a boxer to pay for the services of Dr. Burgess, the best obstetrician in the city, all without telling Dorothy. Eddie is being pummeled in one of these prizefights while Dorothy leaves for the hospital; when he returns and Dorothy sees him bruised and bandaged, she assumes he was in a barroom brawl and turns her back on him. After their son is born, Dorothy plans to leave Eddie; however, before that can happen the misunderstanding is cleared up, and the couple returns home together to raise their child.\nCast.\nUncredited:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThemes.\nThe Depression-era backdrop of poverty and deprivation tinges the characters' preoccupation with and fears about earning money and paying for their needs.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe development of \"Bad Girl\" from the novel and play into a film required extensive purging and rewriting of the material to conform to the dictates of the Hays Office. A November 16, 1928, memo from the Hays Office put a damper on the whole production, stating: \"'Bad Girl' might be produced as a sex hygiene picture called 'Motherhood.' It is simply the story of girl who is 'bad' for one night, marries the boy the next day, and then has a baby\". The memo described the novel as a \"nauseating story of doctors, illnesses, etc.\" and as \"cheap and shoddy writing about cheap and shoddy people\". Several studios besides Fox were interested in the rights to the novel and play, including Path\u00e9, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, and Columbia Pictures, but were either scared off by the Hays Office's warnings of extensive cuts by the censor or the difficulty of dramatizing the novel's main subject of obstetrics. Between 1929 and 1930, the Hays Office advised numerous producers not to attempt an adaptation because it would be \"too censorable\".\nFox, however, came up with a treatment that avoided the scandalous elements of the story and smoothed over the whole issue of premarital sex which Dorothy had with Eddie during their late night in his apartment. Instead, the implications of their night together are not addressed and Eddie's proposal of marriage to save Dorothy from the shame of facing her brother at 4 a.m. comes off as spontaneous. All that remains of the provocative content of the novel is the title, \"Bad Girl\". The script was approved by the Hays Office in May 1931 with only a small number of \"relatively minor\" changes.\nDespite the vote of approval, Fox executives did not hold much stock in the film's commercial appeal and even Borzage refused to direct it. But Fox pressured Borzage into accepting the assignment since his contract was about to expire and was not expected to be renewed. The studio further showed its lack of enthusiasm for the project by budgeting less than $100,000 for the production and hiring unknown actors. As a result, Borzage had a \"fairly free hand\" in the production.\nCasting.\nBorzage wanted Spencer Tracy to play the lead role, but Fox would not agree to this. After seeing a screen test that New York stage actor James Dunn had done at Fox Film's Astoria Studios in Queens, Borzage chose him for the role of Eddie and Dunn was signed to a Fox contract. Dunn made his screen debut in \"Bad Girl\". Eilers had previously appeared in Buster Keaton films as an ing\u00e9nue and was known for using \"the filthiest language in Hollywood\", thus connecting her in some way to the title character.\nFilming.\nProduction took place between June 1 and July 4, 1931.\nRelease.\nThe film premiered at the Roxy Theatre in New York City on August 14, 1931, and in Los Angeles on August 25. It had its official U.S. release on September 13, 1931. The film was not released in Europe.\nStage producer Robert V. Newman filed suit against Fox and the Roxy Theatre after the New York premiere, contending that he had sold Fox the rights to the play on the condition that the film not be released before September 1. The New York Supreme Court threw out the case, stating that \"no substantial damage\" had been done by the earlier premiere date.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Bad Girl\" was one of Fox's most successful releases of 1931, earning $1.1 million at the box office.\nCritical reception.\nThe \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" praised the film as a modern take on contemporary life, describing it as \"so human, so free from pretense and so provocatively real\". According to Borzage biographer Herv\u00e9 Dumont, the film surprised contemporary critics as it was \"stripped of all conventional ingredients\u2014love triangles, jealousy, sex appeal or crimes\u2014but buoyed by the cheerful exuberance that apparently effortlessly metamorphoses a mixture of little nothings into a gem of subtlety and charm\". Dumont notes that Borzage deftly circumvented anything that could be considered provocative and instead brought out the humor and sentimentality of the relationship between the main characters. Reid calls the result both realistic and romantic. A \"Los Angeles Times\" review credits Borzage as \"the dominant force\" behind the film, but also commends screenwriter Edwin J. Burke's dialogue \"as amazingly skillful in satisfying the demand for wisecracks while retaining the quality of naturalness and always keeping in character\".\nJames Dunn's performance was singled out by many reviews as the pivot around which the film revolves. The \"Baltimore Evening Sun\" wrote: \"Without Dunn, \"Bad Girl\" would be just another movie. With him, it's something that provokes chuckles, tears, laughs, sighs and everything else that a nice little movie hopes to provoke\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" called Dunn's first starring turn \"triumphant\", asserting that \"no performance has lately equaled the impression made by this rather plain young man, who, aside from having a likable personality, scores a major hit by his ability as an actor\". The \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" said of Dunn: \"Sincere, honest and natural, his performance is flawless\". Rebutting a review that claimed any actor would have succeeded in the \"sure-fire part\", a \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" reviewer argued:\nIt was a role so skillfully conceived and executed, so sympathetically played and so warm and sincere that one's natural inclination is to put the actor in this case above the role rather than the role above the actor. ... Mr. Dunn, on the other hand, created a character. It had a definite form. It breathed life. It had depth and feeling. Not for a moment were you conscious of James Dunn. You were conscious only of Eddie Collins.\nThe \"Brattleboro Reformer\" wrote: \"James Dunn, as the sensitive, nervous, conscientious young husband in this, his first, picture gives a performance of astonishing strength. \u2026 He presents a new kind of film star and a personality of infectious charm\". The scene in which Dunn as Eddie pleads with Dr. Burgess to take his wife's case was cited by the \"Los Angeles Times\" as \"the equal of any of the great moments in past pictures\", and by the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" as \"probably the most notable work of the season\".\nCritics also praised the female performers. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called Sally Eilers' role \"easily her best performance and it, too, is perfect\". The \"Bratteboro Reformer\" commended Eilers' ability to convey a range of moods and emotions while also projecting personal charm. Minna Gombell was cited for adding \"warmth and sympathy\" to her characterization of the wisecracking friend.\nAccolades.\n\"Bad Girl\" was nominated in three categories at the 5th Academy Awards, winning in two:\n\"Bad Girl\" was named one of the ten best films of the year by \"Film Daily\", and one of the \"Ten Best Pictures of 1931\" by \"The New York Times\".\nAdaptations.\nThe film spawned several adaptations. In October 1931, Fox produced a Spanish-language adaptation for the South American market titled \"Marido y Mujer\" (\"Husband and Wife\"), directed by Bert Sebell and released in 1932. \"Bad Boy\", also starring James Dunn and directed by John G. Blystone, was released in 1935. 20th Century Fox remade the story in 1940 as \"Manhattan Heartbeat\", starring Robert Sterling and Virginia Gilmore.\nRe-teaming Dunn and Eilers.\nFollowing the film's success, Fox immediately teamed Dunn and Eilers in more films together. They starred in \"Over the Hill\" (1931), \"Dance Team\" (1932), \"Sailor's Luck\" (1933), and \"Hold Me Tight\" (1933). The 1933 film \"Jimmy and Sally\" was also written and titled with the duo in mind, but after Eilers declined to play the lead, her part was given to Claire Trevor.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The picture tells the story of a washed-up alcoholic boxer (Beery) attempting to put his life back together for the sake of his young son (Cooper).\nBeery won the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance (sharing the prize with Fredric March for \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\"), Frances Marion won the Academy Award for Best Story, and the film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to King Vidor's career.\nPlot.\nAndy \"Champ\" Purcell (Wallace Beery) is the former world heavyweight champion, now down on his luck and living in squalid conditions with his eight-year-old son \"Dink\" in Tijuana, Mexico. Champ attempts to convince promoters to set up a fight for him, but his efforts are stymied by his alcoholism. Dink is repeatedly disappointed by his father's irresponsible actions and frequent broken promises, but his devotion to his father never wavers.\nChamp is also a compulsive gambler\u2014another vice he repeatedly promises to give up. After a winning streak, he fulfills a previous promise to buy Dink a horse, which they name \"Little Champ\" and plan to race. At the track, Dink encounters a woman who, unbeknownst to either of them, is his mother, Linda, now remarried to a wealthy man named Tony.\nLinda and Tony observe Dink and Champ together and realize that Dink is her son. Champ allows Linda to see Dink, who accepts that she is his mother. But he feels no emotion toward her, as she has never been part of his life. Linda resolves to remove Dink from the miserable atmosphere in which he's growing up and have him live with her family.\nTony catches Champ during an all-night gambling binge and asks him to turn Dink over so that he and Linda can enroll the boy in school. Champ refuses. By the end of the night, he has lost Little Champ, devastating Dink. Champ then asks Linda for money to buy the horse back, and she agrees. However, instead of using it as promised, he gambles the money away and ends up in jail, breaking Dink\u2019s heart once again.\nAshamed, Champ finally agrees to send an unwilling Dink to live with Tony and Linda. On the train ride home, Tony and Linda try their best to welcome Dink into their family. He does not dislike them, but he is consumed only by thoughts of his father. He runs away back to Tijuana, where he finds that Champ has a fight scheduled with the Mexican heavyweight champion. When he sees Dink, Champ returns to good spirits, trains hard, and, for the first time, really does stay away from drinking and gambling. Champ is determined to win the fight, make Dink proud of him, and use his prize money to buy back Little Champ.\nTony and Linda attend the fight, bringing best wishes and assurances that they will make no further efforts to separate Dink from Champ. The match is brutal, and Champ is seriously injured. Dink and the others in his corner urge him to throw in the towel, but Champ refuses. He musters a last burst of energy and knocks out his opponent. After the fight, he triumphantly presents Little Champ to Dink. But after witnessing his son's overjoyed reaction, Champ collapses.\nHe is brought into his dressing room, where a doctor determines that his injuries are fatal. Champ encourages Dink to stay strong, then dies. Despite others' attempts to comfort him, Dink cries out repeatedly, \"I want the Champ!\" Eventually, he sees Linda enter the room, looks at her, and exclaims, \"Mother!\" before running into her arms. She picks him up, and he sobs, \"The Champ is dead, Mama.\" Holding him close, she turns and carries him out as he buries his face in her shoulder, weeping.\nProduction.\nScreenwriter Frances Marion wrote the title role specifically for Wallace Beery, whose formerly flourishing career, which had almost abruptly ended with the advent of sound, had been revitalized in 1930 with an Academy Award nomination for \"The Big House\" and the huge success of \"Min and Bill\" with Marie Dressler. Director King Vidor eagerly took on the film since it emphasized the traditional family values and strong belief in hope\u2014qualities he felt were essential to a good motion picture. Wallace Beery claimed to have turned down a $500,000 offer from a syndicate of Indian studios to play Buddha in order to take the role in \"The Champ.\" Cooper was paid $1,500 a week while working on the film. A special outdoor set, rather than location shooting, was built to accommodate the Tijuana horse racing track scenes. Shooting began in mid-August 1931 and ended eight weeks later, at which time Jackie Cooper's contract with Paramount Pictures was transferred to MGM.\n\"The Champ\" debuted on November 9, 1931, at the Astor Theatre in New York City. Beery flew his own plane from Los Angeles, California cross-country to attend the premiere. After the film's debut, Beery declared Cooper was a \"great kid\" but that he would not work with the child actor again, a promise he broke within the year for the remake of \"Treasure Island\" and \"The Bowery\".\nAssessment.\nThe film, along with Beery's role in \"Min and Bill\", catapulted Beery's career. Beery signed a contract with MGM shortly thereafter specifying that he receive a dollar more per year than any other actor on the lot, effectively making him the world's highest-paid actor. The picture also made nine-year-old Jackie Cooper the first child star of the 1930s, an era noted for its numerous, popular child actors.\nAt the time the movie was released, critics criticized the film's lack of originality. For example, \"The New York Times\" declared that \"something more novel and subtle\" was needed, although it also praised Beery's acting. \"Variety,\" too, very much liked Beery in the film, noting that he delivered a \"studied, adult\" performance. \"Time\" called the film repetitive, blasted Cooper for sniveling, and accused director King Vidor of laying \"on pathos with a steam-shovel.\" Nonetheless, \"Time\" praised the movie, declaring it \"Utterly false and thoroughly convincing...\" Many critics cited the \"special chemistry\" between Beery and Cooper, which led the two actors to be paired again numerous times. Cooper and Beery had no such chemistry off-screen. Cooper accused Beery of upstaging and other attempts to undermine his performances, out of what Cooper presumed was jealousy. Critics today still highly praise \"The Champ\".\n\"The Champ\" has been described as an inverted women's film, because men in the film are not generally depicted at the top of the socio-economic ladder, but are shown as a primary childcare provider. The famous final scene, in which the camera is thrust into Jackie Cooper's weeping face, has been compared to similar aggressive and intrusive camera work in classic motion pictures such as \"Liebelei\" (Max Oph\u00fcls, dir.; 1933), \"Broken Blossoms\" (D.W. Griffith, dir.; 1919) and the films of Roberto Rossellini.\n\"The Champ\" has had significant cultural effect. A number of motion pictures in the 1930s, some of them also starring Wallace Beery, repeated the basic story about a man surrendering to drink and redeemed by the love of his long-suffering son. Film critic Judith Crist has argued that almost any film pairing an adult actor alongside a child actor must be compared to \"The Champ\" in terms of the chemistry between the actors and the effectiveness of the film. The film had an immediate effect on world cinema as well. \"The Champ\" is considered one source film which inspired Yasujir\u014d Ozu's classic Japanese film \"Passing Fancy\" (\"Dekigokoro\", 1933). The film was, in part, the inspiration for the father and son in the Berenstain Bears books.\nReception.\n\"The Champ\" was a big hit upon its release. According to MGM records, the film earned $917,000 domestically and $683,000 foreign. The film itself also received overwhelmingly positive reviews; as of now, it holds a 96% freshness rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Irene Thirer of the \"New York Daily News\" described the film as \u201cso profuse and so enjoyable as the film combines the amazing talents of Jackie Cooper with the superb histrionics of Wallace Beery\u201d.\nRemakes.\nThe movie was remade in 1952 as \"The Clown,\" starring Red Skelton as a washed-up clown rather than a washed-up boxer. It was remade again in 1979 by Franco Zeffirelli (see \"The Champ\").\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Robinson, Aline MacMahon (in her screen debut) and Boris Karloff. The screenplay was by Robert Lord and Byron Morgan based on the 1930 play of the same name by Louis Weitzenkorn. The title refers to the practice of newspapers publishing a series of editions throughout the day, with their final-edition front page having five stars printed and the word \"Final.\" \"Five Star Final\" is also a font introduced during World War I and then favored by newspapers for its narrow type.\nWarner Bros. remade the film in 1936 as \"Two Against the World\", also known as \"One Fatal Hour\", starring Humphrey Bogart in Robinson's part and set in a radio station instead of at a newspaper.\nThe film was nominated at the 5th Academy Awards (1931/1932) for Best Picture, but lost to \"Grand Hotel\".\nNewspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst was greatly offended by the film, which he interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on him and his operation. He retaliated by publishing negative reviews in his papers and pressuring theaters not to show the film.\nPlot.\nJoseph W. Randall is the managing editor of the \"New York Evening Gazette\" tabloid newspaper who has been trying to legitimize the paper by reducing sensationalism and improving the reporting, but circulation has dropped dramatically. When owner Bernard Hinchecliffe plans to boost sales with a retrospective series on a 20-year-old murder, hoping to revive the scandal, Randall reluctantly agrees. He had covered the original story about stenographer Nancy Voorhees, who shot her boss after he reneged on his promise to marry her. Her pregnancy won the jury's sympathy, and she was acquitted.\nUnaware of impending doom, Nancy is now married to Michael Townsend, an upstanding member of society, and her daughter Jenny, who believes that Townsend is her father, is about to marry the son of a socially prominent family, Philip Weeks.\nRandall throws himself into the assignment. To dig up dirt about Nancy, he assigns unscrupulous reporter \"Reverend\" T. Vernon Isopod, who masquerades as a minister and wins the confidence of the bride's parents on the eve of the wedding. They have read the headlines promising a series on the murder. Nancy is horrified at the renewed interest in the scandal, and the family members confess their concerns to Isopod, whom they mistake for a church representative, and give him a photo of Jenny. Michael realizes the horrible mistake just as Isopod leaves, and he phones the church.\nRandall's secretary Miss Taylor is so disgusted that she gets drunk at a local speakeasy and then tells Randall what she thinks of the whole affair. Isopod comes in late, drunk and brimming with information. Randall swings into action, mocking up a photo layout.\nRandall sends reporters Ziggie and Carmody to cover the Townsend apartment. The Townsends, hoping to prevent the revelation of the full story and save the marriage, make separate appeals for help. Mr. Townsend visits the church rector, who promises support, and Nancy phones Randall, begging him to drop the story, but he refuses, telling her that it is too late. Nancy kills herself by taking poison, and Michael comes home and discovers her body in the bathroom. When Jenny and Philip visit soon after, Michael does not inform them of the suicide and pretends to have a phone conversation with Nancy. After sending Jenny and Philip away, he enters the bathroom and also commits suicide. Carmody and Ziggie climb into the apartment from the fire escape. When they open the bathroom door, they take a photograph and call the information into Randall, who wants the story for the five-star final.\nThe next day, Phillip's parents tell Jenny that the wedding will be called off, but Phillip arrives and defies them. Randall gets drunk and feels like a murderer. He tells the night desk to drop the story.\nHinchecliff is leery of the bad publicity that may result from the inquest, but his underlings are thrilled at the upsurge in numbers and want to offer Jenny $1,200 for the rights to tell her mother's story. Randall opposes the idea. Jenny visits the paper and demands that the men tell her why they killed her mother. A guilt-ridden and disgusted Randall tells her that they were killed for the purpose of circulation. Jenny points a gun at Randall but Philip appears just in time to prevent her from pulling the trigger. Phillip then angrily delivers a chilling speech that ends: \"You've grown rich on filth and no one's ever dared rise up and crush you out.\" He threatens to hunt them down and kill them if his wife's name is ever mentioned in the paper again.\nRandall denounces Hinchecliffe and resigns. He runs out and Miss Taylor follows him.\nA copy of the \"New York\" \"Evening Gazette\" trumpeting the news that the suicide victims have been buried is shown swept away in the rain.\nProduction.\nThe film was based on a play written by Louis Weitzenkorn after his stint as editor of Bernarr Macfadden's \"New York Evening Graphic\", a sensationalist tabloid of the 1920s.

It was directed by Josef von Sternberg and stars Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Anna May Wong and Warner Oland. The screenplay was written by Jules Furthman based on a 1931 short story by Harry Hervey. \"Shanghai Express\" was the fourth of seven films that Sternberg and Dietrich created together.\nThe film was released during the midst of the Great Depression. It was remade as \"Night Plane from Chungking\" (1943) and \"Peking Express\" (1951).\nPlot.\nIn 1931, China is embroiled in a civil war. Friends of British captain Donald \"Doc\" Harvey envy him because Shanghai Lily is traveling on the express train he is taking from Peiping to Shanghai. They tell him she is a \"coaster\", a \"woman who lives by her wits along the China coast\" (i.e., a prostitute). Lily is in fact his former lover Madeline. Five years earlier, she had played a trick on him to gauge his love for her, but it backfired and he left her. She informs him, \"It took more than one man to change my name to Shanghai Lily.\" Lily still loves him, and she notices that he still wears a watch with her photograph in it.\nAmong the other passengers in first class are fellow coaster Hui Fei, Christian missionary Mr. Carmichael (who calls the coasters \"fallen women\"), gambler Sam Salt, opium dealer Eric Baum, boarding-house keeper Mrs. Haggerty, French officer Major Lenard, and a mysterious Eurasian, Henry Chang.\nAt a scheduled stop, Chinese government soldiers empty the train to check passports and apprehend a high-ranking rebel agent. Chang sends a message at the telegraph office. Later, the train is stopped and commandeered by the rebel army and its powerful warlord, who turns out to be Chang. He tortures Baum for insulting him on the train. He starts questioning the other first-class passengers, looking for someone important enough to keep as a hostage in exchange for his aide. Harvey, traveling to perform brain surgery on the governor-general of Shanghai, becomes the hostage.\nWaiting for his aide to arrive, Chang offers to take Lily to his palace. She declines, claiming she has reformed. Harvey breaks in and knocks Chang down. Because he needs Harvey alive, Chang does not retaliate at that point. He has Hui Fei brought to his quarters, where he rapes her. Lily is taken back to the train and stays up praying for Harvey.\nWhen Chang's man arrives, Chang tells Lily he plans to blind Harvey in revenge. She tells Chang she will go to his palace with him. Harvey is released unharmed, unaware he was to be blinded at the hands of Chang.\nHui Fei sneaks back into Chang's quarters and stabs him to death as he is packing to leave. She tells Harvey to rescue Lily, which he does. Carmichael, realizing he was wrong to condemn Lily, coaxes Lily to reveal the truth about how she had saved Harvey. She insists that he not tell Harvey and he agrees, telling Harvey that he knows Lily is a good person.\nThe train reaches Shanghai, and the passengers disperse. Harvey finds Lily while she is buying him a new watch, and asks her to forgive him for his lack of faith. They kiss amidst the bustle of the train station.\nProduction.\n\"Shanghai Express\" is based on Henry Hervey's story \"Sky Over China\" (also known as \"China Pass\"), which was loosely based on the Lincheng Incident that occurred on May 6, 1923, in which a Shandong warlord captured the Shanghai-to-Beijing express train and took 25 Westerners, including Lucy Aldrich, and 300 Chinese people hostage. All of the hostages were successfully ransomed.\nThe story also echoes elements of Guy de Maupassant's short story \"Boule de Suif\" in that it consists of travelers stopped in a country at war and a woman is forced into intimate relations with the commander in charge. However, the denouement differs; in Maupassant's story, the woman does not murder the commander.\nParamount studio heads were concerned that the Hays Office kept a close watch on the film for its portrayal of Reverend Carmichael and the depiction of the 1911 Revolution.\nAlthough set in China, few Chinese actors appear in the film. However, Anna May Wong, who was American-born Chinese, has a major role, and many Chinese extras are used in the film.\n\"Shanghai Express\" film was in production from August to November 1931 and was released the following year.\nReception.\nThe film was praised by Mordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" as a star vehicle for Marlene Dietrich: \"Miss Dietrich gives an impressive performance. She is languorous but fearless as Lily.\" He also singled out other characters: \"Clive Brooks's performance is also noteworthy...Warner Oland is excellent as Mr. Chang and Anna May Wong makes the most of the role of the brave Chinese girl. Eugene Pallette serves splendidly as Sam Salt.\"\nJonathan Spence, writing about the film's usefulness as a piece of history, feels that the real 1923 Lincheng Incident was far more dramatic, but says that \"Shanghai Express\" is nonetheless \"a wonderful film, with great performances by Dietrich ... and Anna May Wong.\"\nThe critic for \"Senses of Cinema\" called \"Shanghai Express\" a \"riotous exercise in excess in every area; the visuals are overpowering and sumptuous; the costumes ornate and extravagant; the sets a riot of fabrics, light and space; and all of it captured in the most delectable black-and-white cinematography that one can find anywhere.\" He discusses the film's interest in the questions of race and colonialism and notes the \"peculiar bifurcation\" of the film's view of race, as most of the respectable \"white\" characters in the film are seen as both flawed and racist. He says only the characters played Dietrich, Wong, and Brook have \"real moral agency.\" He calls the film \"surprisingly feminist,\" with Dietrich being a \"strong, dominating presence\" and Wong's character her equal.\n\"Shanghai Express\" is memorable for its stylistic black-and-white chiaroscuro cinematography. Even though Lee Garmes was awarded the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, according to Dietrich, it was von Sternberg who was responsible for most of it.\nThe film was a box office success grossing $827,000 in rentals the US and Canada and $1.5 million altogether in worldwide rentals. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a rating of 96% from 67 reviews.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"Shanghai Express\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nLegacy.\nLucile Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107 said that Marlene Dietrich's character in \"Shanghai Express\" was the spark behind the character Cristina (portrayed by Marion Cotillard) in her 2025 fantasy drama film \"The Ice Tower\". \"Her elegance, her mystery\u2014it's all there.

The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was the first of three films directed by Lubitsch and starring Miriam Hopkins. The other two were \"Trouble in Paradise\" and \"Design for Living\".\nPlot.\nIn Vienna, Lieutenant Nikolaus \"Niki\" von Preyn meets Franzi, the leader of an all-female-orchestra. They soon fall in love. While standing in formation at a parade honouring the visiting royal family of Flausenthurm, Niki winks at Franzi in the crowd. Unfortunately the gesture is intercepted by Anna, the Princess of Flausenthurm. The naive princess takes offence; to assuage her, the lieutenant insists that he winked and smiled at her because of her beauty. This backfires; charmed and besotted, Anna demands that she marry the lieutenant, and threatens to marry an American if this plan is thwarted. Franzi leaves Niki upon seeing him return in a royal carriage. After intervention by the Emperor of Austria, an international incident is narrowly averted by the marriage of the lieutenant and the princess, though the marriage is not consummated, as Niki will only chastely kiss his bride\u2014and his father-in-law.\nHomesick and lovesick, Niki wanders the streets, and encounters Franzi, who has continued to perform with her orchestra in Flausenthurm since the wedding, unable to move on. The two resume their romance.\nAnna finds out and confronts Franzi. During the confrontation, Franzi realizes that the princess is in fact deeply in love with the lieutenant. She decides to save the marriage by giving the dowdy princess a makeover, and they sing the duet \"Jazz up your lingerie!\" before Franzi departs for good. The results are a complete success as the lieutenant returns home, follows his satin-clad, cigarette-puffing wife into the bedroom and closes the door \u2013 opening it briefly to give the audience a last song and suggestive wink.\nProduction.\nThe film was not made under pleasant circumstances: the shift to the Astoria, New York, studios accounts for the sense of confinement on set. Chevalier described performing \u2013 \"smiles and cute winks of the eye\" \u2013 a \"mechanical display of technique\" due to grief over his mother's death. Lubitsch also played referee between Colbert and Hopkins, who were determined to be shot from the same angle. Lubitsch encouraged their dispute that suited their characters on screen.\nScenes from the film were included in the 1931 promotional film by Paramount, \"The House That Shadows Built\".\nReception.\n\"The Smiling Lieutenant\" was Paramount's biggest grosser of 1931. Barrios claims that \"Lubitsch and Chevalier were invincible\". It was also named the year's \"Best Ten\" by \"The New York Times\", along with Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights\" and F. W. Murnau's \"Tabu\".\nLubitsch was still in the stages of mastering sound-on-film technology and combining it with narrative: James Harvey acclaims that \"technically \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" is the most accomplished of Lubitsch's early sound films. In sets, camerawork, background music, alternations of sound and silence, thus the film reaches a certain level that makes \"The Love Parade\" and \"Monte Carlo\" look comparatively stilted\". For Andrew Sarris, \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" stands between the \"lilting lyricism\" of \"Love Parade\" and the \"tempered ironies\" in \"Trouble in Paradise\".\nDue to an ongoing copyright dispute with the silent-film version, \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" remained out of circulation for years and was considered as a lost film until a print was discovered in Denmark in the 1990s. When the film resurfaced, the \"general elation\" was followed by \"an inevitable let down\" due to technical problems.\n\"The Lubitsch Touch\".\nThe notion of \"The Lubitsch Touch\" is used to describe the visual comment or joke that becomes a trademark or signature of Lubitsch's films. Billy Wilder defines the touch in relation to \"The Smiling Lieutenant\": \"It was the elegant use of the Superjoke. You had a joke, and you felt satisfied, and then there was one more big joke on top of it. The joke you didn't expect. That was the Lubitsch touch.\" The ultimate Superjoke is that at the end of the film, \"the wrong girl gets the man\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

NEPAD was adopted by the AU at the 37th session of the Assembly of Heads of State and Government in July 2001 in Lusaka, Zambia. NEPAD aims to provide an overarching vision and policy framework for accelerating economic co-operation and integration among African countries.\nOrigins and function.\nNEPAD is a merger of two plans for the economic regeneration of Africa: the Millennium Partnership for the African Recovery Programme (MAP), led by Former President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa in conjunction with Former President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika of Algeria; and the OMEGA Plan for Africa developed by President Abdoulaye Wade of Senegal. At a summit in Sirte, Libya, March 2001, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) agreed that the MAP and OMEGA Plans should be merged.\nThe UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) developed a \"Compact for Africa\u2019s Recovery\" based on both these plans and on resolutions on Africa adopted by the United Nations Millennium Summit in September 2000, and submitted a merged document to the Conference of African Ministers of Finance and Ministers of Development and Planning in Algiers, May 2001.\nIn July 2001, the OAU Assembly of Heads of State and Government meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, adopted this document under the name of the New African Initiative (NAI). The leaders of G8 countries endorsed the plan on July 20, 2001; and other international development partners, including the European Union, China, and Japan also made public statements indicating their support for the program. The Heads of State and Government Implementation Committee (HSGIC) for the project finalized the policy framework and named it the New Partnership for Africa's Development on 23 October 2001. NEPAD became a program of the African Union (AU) after it replaced the OAU in 2002, though it has its own secretariat based in South Africa to coordinate and implement its programmes.\nNEPAD's four primary objectives are: to eradicate poverty, promote sustainable growth and development, integrate Africa in the world economy, and accelerate the empowerment of women. It is based on underlying principles of a commitment to good governance, democracy, human rights and conflict resolution; and the recognition that maintenance of these standards is fundamental to the creation of an environment conducive to investment and long-term economic growth. NEPAD seeks to attract increased investment, capital flows and funding, providing an African-owned framework for development as the foundation for partnership at regional and international levels.\nIn July 2002, the Durban AU summit supplemented NEPAD with a Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance. According to the Declaration, states participating in NEPAD \u2018believe in just, honest, transparent, accountable and participatory government and probity in public life\u2019. Accordingly, they \u2018undertake to work with renewed determination to enforce\u2019, among other things, the rule of law; the equality of all citizens before the law; individual and collective freedoms; the right to participate in free, credible and democratic political processes; and adherence to the separation of powers, including protection for the independence of the judiciary and the effectiveness of parliaments.\nThe Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance also committed participating states to establish an African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM) to promote adherence to and fulfilment of its commitments. The 2002 Durban summit adopted a document outlining the stages of peer review and the principles by which the APRM should operate; further core documents were adopted at a meeting in Abuja in March 2003, including a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed by governments wishing to undertake the peer review.\nCurrent status.\nSuccessive AU summits and meetings of the HSGIC have proposed the greater integration of NEPAD into the AU's structures and processes. In March 2007 there was a \"brainstorming session\" on NEPAD held in Algeria at which the future of NEPAD and its relationship with the AU was discussed by an ad hoc committee of heads of state. The committee again recommended the fuller integration of NEPAD with the AU. In April 2008, a review summit of five heads of state\u2014Presidents Mbeki of South Africa, Wade of Senegal, Bouteflika of Algeria, Mubarak of Egypt and Yar'Adua of Nigeria\u2014met in Senegal with a mandate to consider the progress in implementing NEPAD and report to the next AU summit to be held in Egypt in July 2008. In July 2018, the African Union (AU) Assembly approved the transformation of the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency into the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD), establishing it as the AU's technical body to drive the implementation of Agenda 2063.\nStructure.\nAUDA-NEPAD Heads of State and Government Committee (HSGOC).\nA 33-Member State sub-committee of the African Union Assembly of Heads of State and Government that provides the highest political leadership and strategic guidance on Agenda 2063 priority issues and reports its recommendations to the full Assembly for endorsement. The Chairperson of the AU Commission also participates in HSGOC Summits. The current (2025) Chairperson of the AUDA-NEPAD HSGOC is H.E. Abdel Fattah El-Sisi, President of the Arab Republic of Egypt. \nThere is also a Steering Committee, comprising 20 AU member states, to oversee the development of policies, programs and projects -this committee reports to the HSGIC.\nThe NEPAD Secretariat, renamed the NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA), was later integrated into the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) and remains based in Midrand, South Africa. The NEPAD Secretariat is not responsible for the implementation of development programs itself, but works with the African Regional Economic Communities\u2014 the building blocks of the African Union. The role of the NEPAD Secretariat is one of coordination and resource mobilisation.\nMany individual African states have also established national NEPAD structures responsible for liaison with the continental initiatives on economic reform and development programs.\nPrograms.\nThe eight priority areas of NEPAD are: political, economic and corporate governance; agriculture; infrastructure; education; health; science and technology; market access and tourism; and environment.\nDuring the first few years of its existence, the main task of the NEPAD Secretariat and key supporters was the popularisation of NEPAD's key principles, as well as the development of action plans for each of the sectoral priorities. NEPAD also worked to develop partnerships with international development finance institutions\u2014including the World Bank, G8, European Commission, UNECA and others\u2014and with the private sector.\nAfter this initial phase, more concrete programs were developed, including:\nCriticism.\nNEPAD was initially met with a great deal of scepticism from much of civil society in Africa as playing into the 'Washington Consensus' model of economic development. In July 2002, members of some 40 African social movements, trade unions, youth and women's organizations, NGOs, religious organizations and others endorsed the African Civil Society Declaration on NEPAD rejecting NEPAD; a similar hostile view was taken by African scholars and activist intellectuals in the 2002 Accra Declaration on Africa's Development Challenges.\nPart of the problem in this rejection was that the process by which NEPAD was adopted was insufficiently participatory\u2014civil society was almost totally excluded from the discussions by which it came to be adopted.\nMore recently, NEPAD has also been criticised by some of its initial backers, including notably Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, who accused NEPAD of wasting hundreds of millions of dollars and achieving nothing. Like many other intergovernmental bodies, NEPAD suffers from slow decision-making, and a relatively poorly resourced and often cumbersome implementing framework. The great lack of information about the day-to-day activities of the NEPAD secretariat\u2014the website is notably uninformative\u2014does not help its case.\nHowever, the program has also received some acceptance from those who were initially very critical, and, in general, has seen its status become less controversial as it becomes more established and its programs become more concrete. The aim of promoting greater regional integration and trade among African states is welcomed by many, even as the fundamental macroeconomic principles NEPAD endorses remain contested.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61066", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61066", "title": "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo", "text": "Australian television series\nSkippy the Bush Kangaroo (known commonly as Skippy) is an Australian television series created by Australian actor John McCallum, Lionel (Bob) Austin, and Lee Robinson, produced from 1967 to 1969 (airing from 5 February 1968 to 4 May 1970) about the adventures of a young boy and his highly intelligent pet kangaroo, and the various visitors to the fictional Waratah National Park, filmed in today's Waratah Park and adjoining portions of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park near Sydney.\nThree series comprising 91 30-minute episodes were produced. Additionally, a full-length film titled \"Skippy and the Intruders\" was released to theatres in 1969.\nPlot and setting.\nSkippy, the show's namesake star, is a female eastern grey kangaroo, that is befriended by 9-year-old Sonny Hammond, who with 16-year-old brother Mark are the children of widower Matt Hammond, the head ranger of Waratah National Park. The stories revolved around events in the park, including its animals, the dangers arising from natural hazards, and the actions of visitors (featuring numerous stars, predominately of the period in guesting roles). The boys' mother is said (in episode 48 \"The Mine\") to have died shortly after Sonny was born.\nThe small and unusually intelligent Skippy was not a pet, and the series often mentioned that Skippy lived in the park and was free to come and go as she pleased. Skippy was found in the bush as a baby by Sonny\u2014an orphan, her mother having been killed by shooters. That once Skippy was old enough to look after herself, she was always understood to be able to go back to the bush, but a strong bond had been built up between Skippy and Sonny and the rest of the Hammond family. Skippy was a remarkable kangaroo. Capable of near-human thought and reasoning, she could understand everyone, open doors, carry things in her pouch, cross streams on narrow logs, foil villains, rescue hapless bushwalkers, untie ropes, collect the mail, and even operate the radio. In one episode, she plays drums in a band; in another, she places a bet - and wins - on a horse at Randwick Racecourse.\nSharing the ranger headquarters residence was the helicopter pilot, Flight Ranger Jerry King, aged in his mid-20s. Later, several female characters were introduced to the series, including Dr. Anna Steiner, a research scientist working in the park, and schoolgirl Clancy Merrick, the teenaged daughter of another park ranger who boards with the Hammonds. Members of the Aboriginal Theatre from Yirrkala in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory made guest appearances in three episodes.\nThe series was often characterised as an Australian or kangaroo version of \"Flipper\" or \"Lassie\".\nEpisodes.\nThree series were made with a total of 91 episodes, and production was wound up in September 1969. Producers never intended to make more, partly because 91 episodes were considered enough, and partly because the child actor who played Sonny, Garry Pankhurst, was growing up.\nProduction.\nThe Skippy TV series was produced by Fauna Productions. During 1963, British film director Michael Powell had visited Australia to preproduce his film, \"They're A Weird Mob\". There, he met actor and theatre businessman John McCallum and legal expert Bob Austin, who used their local knowledge to find financing from Australian backers. The film did well, and McCallum and Austin together with veteran Australian producer Lee Robinson went on to set up Fauna Productions. \nThe business made its reputation with \"Skippy\", produced in association with Frank Packer's TCN Channel 9 Sydney. Fauna Productions went on to produce the TV series \"Barrier Reef\" and \"Boney\", as well as the feature film \"Nickel Queen\". Fauna Productions is still in business, now being run by two sons of the founders, Philip Austin and Nick McCallum. It holds copyright over the original Skippy TV series, while the Nine Network holds the trademark.\nMost episodes were directed by Max Varnel or Eric Fullilove, with scripts written by Australian writers. Producer Lee Robinson said, \"Each story has the underlying thought, which is the preservation of wildlife\".\nAccomplished musician, band-leader, and composer Eric Jupp was responsible for the theme and incidental music for Skippy. \"It took me a few days to write the Skippy theme,\" said Jupp. 'I'd already written three or four versions and then rejected them. But the effort has proved worthwhile because about 30,000 records of the theme have been sold in Australia alone.'.\nLocation filming.\nThe series was shot in northern Sydney, on then undeveloped Crown land west of Namba Road now known as Waratah Park. Permission to film and build structures on the site was given by Warringah Council. Also necessary was the cooperation of the newly created NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, under government minister Tom Lewis, and the Ku-ring-gai Chase Trust to allow access to a further within the adjacent Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. Following preparatory work, filming commenced in May 1967.\nThe ranger headquarters and residence was purpose-built for the series and used for both exterior and interior scenes. Power and water supply had to be connected and roads constructed, together with a helipad and helicopter-servicing area. Other national parks were also used for filming, as well as the streets and beaches of Sydney and surrounding districts. \"The Australian bush provided an excellent scenic backdrop, which was much appreciated by local and overseas viewers alike.\"\nAnimal actors.\nBetween 9 and 15 kangaroos were used for each show. The apparent manual dexterity was often achieved by using separate arms in the hands of human operators. Skippy's trademark \"tchk tchk tchk\" noise was entirely fictional. Kangaroos make no such sounds, but some sort of sound was needed for the series, and someone came up with the idea of clicking tongues to make the sound. To this day, many people believe that kangaroos make \"tchk tchk\" noises. To make Skippy move her mouth, supposedly creating the vocalisations, production staff gave the kangaroos chocolate, chewing gum, or grass, and in some cases, an elastic band around the lower jaw.\nA menagerie of other animals and birds was used for the show, including dingoes, possums, emus, galahs, and koalas, all trained and managed by Scotty Denholm, a former NSW police-dog trainer. In theory, there was only one Skippy, but in reality, many stand-ins were used. \"Like people, some kangaroos are brighter than others,\" said producer Dennis Hill. Nonetheless, limits exist as to what one can get a kangaroo to do. Often, the actors could be noticed patting the kangaroo to get her to move, or holding her to prevent her moving. Kangaroo-paw bottle openers, of a type that could be purchased at any souvenir shop, were used for close-up scenes of Skippy opening doors or picking up objects. Also, a stuffed kangaroo from a taxidermist was used for scenes from behind, or when Skippy was required to jump into a confined space such as the helicopter.\nFeature film.\nFilming of the Skippy movie commenced in October 1968. Entitled \"The Intruders\" or \"Skippy and the Intruders\", the movie was largely filmed on the Waratah Park set, as well as near the south coast town of Mallacoota. \"Basically a feature-length episode, the movie was seen as a good, rollicking adventure yarn and was well-received by Skippy fans.\"\nPopularity and awards.\nSkippy was the first Australian series to be heavily merchandised. The Skippy Club boasted over 67,000 members. In Japan, short 8mm colour films were on sale. In Australia and many overseas countries, one could buy Skippy pyjamas, ice-creams, toys, jewellery, soap, comics, jelly-beans, rulers, pencils, puzzles, toothpaste, shampoo, T-shirts, towels, and soft drinks. The Commercial Banking Company had Skippy moneyboxes, the contents of which could be banked with the details entered into a Skippy passbook. There were LP and EP records, an adventure story narrated by John McCallum, and several books, and in 2009, one could still buy Skippy Corn Flakes. The popularity of Skippy was summed up by Fauna's marketing and merchandising manager, Kevin Gleeson: 'Skippy is clean, non-violent fun with no sex. It's wholesome, family-type entertainment. . . most importantly, any necessary violence is innocuous and insignificant, with the old Skippy coming to the rescue at the end of each episode.'.\nSkippy won a number of awards: \nAll three series of Skippy plus \"The Intruders\" have been released on DVD. The series sold around the world, reportedly shown in 128 countries. It is still being shown in some countries, some 51 years after it was made. Lee Robinson says the series only recovered its costs in 1976.\nBroadcast history.\nDomestic.\nThe show was produced for global distribution and filmed in colour. It premiered outside of Australia. The domestic premiere in Sydney (on TCN-9) and Melbourne (GTV-9) was Monday evening, 5 February 1968.\nThe Nine Network readily repeated the series several times after Australian television switched to colour transmission in 1975. In 2009, the Nine Network began to rerun the series in a graveyard slot in the early hours of the morning. In 2013, 9Gem started showing \"Skippy\" at 6:30 am.\nInternational.\nThe Australian series was one of the most popular exported television programs. \"Skippy\" was broadcast in all Commonwealth countries, including in Canada, where it was adapted in Quebec for the Standard French market as .\nMaking its debut in the UK on 8 October 1967 on ATV (four months before it was released in its native Australia), \"Skippy\" rivalled \"Doctor Who\" and \"The Avengers\" in terms of popularity in Britain\u2019s \"TV Comic\".\n\"Skippy\" was broadcast in Mexico, where it was dubbed into Spanish and known as , and has been seen in most Spanish-speaking countries, including Cuba and Spain, where it became very popular. In Lat\u00edn America, the show was broadcast on free TV in the 1970s, and on pay TV (cable, satellite and IPTV) v\u00eda Sundance Channel (Channel 520 of DIRECTV).\nIn the Netherlands, \"Skippy\" was first broadcast between 1969 and 1972. In Germany, it was known as , while in Italy, it was known as and broadcast by RAI Television. The show was popular in Scandinavia, and in Norway, a chain of shopping centres were named in honour of the programme. The series crossed the Iron Curtain and was broadcast in Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union during the 1970s and 1980s. The series was also widely distributed in Ghana, where it aired weekly on the GBC. The series was also broadcast in Iran. \"Skippy\" was syndicated in the United States during the late 1960s; it was frequently scheduled on weekends, with other children's programmes.\n\"The Adventures of Skippy\".\nThe series was revived in 1992 as the short-lived \"The Adventures of Skippy\". This revival series focused on the now-adult Sonny Hammond (played by Andrew Clarke) \u2013 having followed in his father's footsteps by becoming a ranger at a wildlife park \u2013 who now had his own family and a pet kangaroo named Skippy.\nIn the U.S., this version also aired on Animal Planet in 1997, and also on TBN's Smile of a Child children's network until 2019.\nA series of 39 episodes has been released on DVD by Umbrella Entertainment.\nLater history.\nIn 1998, an animated spin-off series was produced, known as \"\". It featured a version of Skippy, portrayed as a male, anthropomorphic kangaroo, working as a park ranger.\nIn 1999, Skippy starred in advertisements for the chocolate confectionery Rolo Cookies.\nIn September 2008, actor Tony Bonner sued the production company seeking residuals from merchandising and DVD sales from the series.\nOn 17 September 2009, a documentary \"Skippy: Australia's First Superstar\" was broadcast on the ABC in Australia and the BBC in the UK. The documentary was produced by Western Australian-based documentary production company Electric Pictures.\nIn popular culture.\nThe original series was parodied in a recurring sketch as part of the British comedy series \"Goodness Gracious Me\" under the title \"Skipinder, the Punjabi Kangaroo\": the parody redubbed scenes from the original \"Skippy\". The show was also parodied in the 1989\u20131992 Australian sketch comedy TV show, \"Fast Forward\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Born in Eatonton, Georgia, where he served as an apprentice on a plantation during his teenage years, Harris spent most of his adult life in Atlanta working as an associate editor at \"The Atlanta Constitution\".\nHarris led two professional lives: as the editor and journalist known as Joe Harris, he supported a vision of the New South with the editor Henry W. Grady (1880\u20131889), which stressed regional and racial reconciliation after the Reconstruction era; as Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, he wrote many 'Brer Rabbit' stories from the African-American oral tradition.\nLife.\nEducation: 1848\u20131862.\nJoel Chandler Harris was born in Eatonton, Georgia, in 1848 to Mary Ann Harris, an Irish immigrant. His father, whose identity remains unknown, abandoned Mary Ann shortly after Harris' birth. The parents had never married; the boy was named Joel after his mother's attending physician, Dr. Joel Branham. Chandler was the name of his mother's uncle. Harris remained self-conscious of his illegitimate birth throughout his life.\nA prominent physician, Dr. Andrew Reid, gave the Harris family a small cottage to use behind his mansion. Mary Harris worked as a seamstress and helped neighbors with their gardening to support herself and her son. She was an avid reader and instilled in her son a love of language: \"My desire to write\u2014to give expression to my thoughts\u2014grew out of hearing my mother read \"The Vicar of Wakefield\".\"\nDr. Reid also paid for Harris' school tuition for several years. In 1856, Joe Harris briefly attended Kate Davidson's School for Boys and Girls, but transferred to Eatonton School for Boys later that year. He had an undistinguished academic record and a habit of truancy. Harris excelled in reading and writing, but was mostly known for his pranks, mischief, and sense of humor. Practical jokes helped Harris cloak his shyness and insecurities about his red hair, Irish ancestry, and illegitimacy, leading to both trouble and a reputation as a leader among the older boys.\nTurnwold Plantation: 1862\u20131866.\nAt the age of 14, Harris quit school to work. In March 1862, Joseph Addison Turner, owner of Turnwold Plantation nine miles east of Eatonton, hired Harris to work as a printer's devil for his newspaper \"The Countryman\". Harris worked for clothing, room, and board. The newspaper reached subscribers throughout the Confederacy during the Civil War; it was considered one of the larger newspapers in the South, with a circulation of about 2,000. Harris learned to set type for the paper, and Turner allowed him to publish his own poems, book reviews, and humorous paragraphs.\nTurner's instruction and technical expertise exerted a profound influence on Harris. During his four-year tenure at Turnwold Plantation, Joel Harris consumed the literature in Turner's library. He had access to Chaucer, Dickens, Sir Thomas Browne, \"Arabian Nights\", Shakespeare, Milton, Swift, Thackeray, and Edgar Allan Poe. Turner, a fiercely independent Southern loyalist and eccentric intellectual, emphasized the work of southern writers, yet stressed that Harris read widely. In \"The Countryman\" Turner insisted that Harris not shy away from including humor in his journalism.\nWhile at Turnwold Plantation, Harris spent hundreds of hours in the slave quarters during time off. He was less self-conscious there and felt his humble background as an illegitimate, red-headed son of an Irish immigrant helped foster an intimate connection with the slaves. He absorbed the stories, language, and inflections of people like Uncle George Terrell, Old Harbert, and Aunt Crissy. The African-American animal tales they shared later became the foundation and inspiration for Harris's Uncle Remus tales. George Terrell and Old Harbert in particular became models for Uncle Remus, as well as role models for Harris.\nSavannah and the South: 1866\u20131876.\nJoseph Addison Turner shut down \"The Countryman\" in May 1866. Joel Harris left the plantation with worthless Confederate money and very few possessions. He lived for a period at The Marshall House.\n\"The Macon Telegraph\" hired Harris as a typesetter later that year. Harris found the work unsatisfactory and himself the butt of jokes around the office, in no small part due to his red hair. Within five months, he accepted a job working for the \"New Orleans Crescent Monthly\", a literary journal. Just six months after that, homesick, he returned to Georgia, but with another opportunity at the \"Monroe Advertiser\", a weekly paper published in Forsyth, Georgia.\nAt the \"Advertiser\" Harris found a regional audience with his column \"Affairs of Georgia.\" Newspapers across the state reprinted his humorous paragraphs and political barbs. Harris' reputation earned him the position of associate editor at the \"Savannah Morning News\", the largest circulation newspaper in Georgia. Though he relished his position in Forsyth, Joe Harris accepted the $40-a-week job, a significant pay increase, and quickly established himself as Georgia's leading humor columnist while at the \"Morning News\".\nIn 1872 Harris met Mary Esther LaRose (Essie), a seventeen-year-old French-Canadian from Quebec. After a year of courtship, Harris and LaRose married in April 1873. LaRose was 18, and Harris 27 (though publicly admitting to 24). Over the next three years, the couple had two children. Their life in Savannah came to an abrupt halt, however, when they fled to Atlanta to avoid a yellow fever epidemic.\nAtlanta: 1876\u20131908.\nIn 1876 Harris was hired by Henry W. Grady at \"The Atlanta Constitution\", where he would remain for the next 24 years. He worked with other journalists including Frank Lebby Stanton, who was in turn an associate of James Whitcomb Riley. Chandler supported the racial reconciliation envisioned by Grady. He often took the mule-drawn trolley to work, picked up his assignments, and brought them home to complete. He wrote for the \"Constitution\" until 1900.\nIn addition, he published local-color stories in magazines such as \"Scribner's\", \"Harper's\", and \"The Century\".\nUncle Remus stories and later years.\nNot long after taking the newspaper appointment, Harris began writing the Uncle Remus stories as a serial to \"preserve in permanent shape those curious mementoes of a period that will no doubt be sadly misrepresented by historians of the future.\" The tales were reprinted across the United States, and Harris was approached by publisher D. Appleton and Company to compile them for a book.\n\"\" was published near the end of 1880. Hundreds of newspapers reviewed the best-seller, and Harris received national attention. Of the press and attention Walter Hines Page noted, \"Joe Harris does not appreciate Joel Chandler Harris.\"\nRoyalties from the book were modest, but allowed Harris to rent a six-room house in West End, an unincorporated village on the outskirts of Atlanta, to accommodate his growing family. Two years later Harris bought the house and hired the architect George Humphries to transform the farmhouse into a Queen Anne Victorian in the Eastlake style. The home, soon thereafter called The Wren's Nest, was where Harris spent most of his time.\nHarris preferred to write at the Wren's Nest. He published prodigiously throughout the 1880s and 1890s, trying his hand at novels, children's literature, and a translation of French folklore. Yet he rarely strayed from home and work during this time. He chose to stay close to his family and his gardening. Harris and his wife Essie had seven more children in Atlanta, with a total of six (out of nine) surviving past childhood.\nBy the late 1890s, Harris was tired of the newspaper grind and suffered from health problems, likely stemming from alcoholism. At the same time, he grew more comfortable with his creative persona.\nHarris retired from the \"Constitution\" in 1900. He continued experimenting with novels and wrote articles for outlets such as \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Still, he remained close to home, refusing to travel to accept honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and Emory College (now Emory University). In 1905 Harris was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nBut in the summer or fall of 1902, Harris traveled to Washington D.C. to accept an invitation to the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt. Five years later the invitation was renewed in November 1907. Roosevelt\u2019s admiration for Harris was expressed in these words from a speech: \"Presidents may come and presidents may go, but Uncle Remus stays put. Georgia has done a great many things for the Union, but she has never done more than when she gave Mr. Joel Chandler Harris to American literature.\"\nEssie Harris was a Catholic, and Harris had long been privately convinced of the truth of that Church's doctrines. On June 20, 1908, shortly before his death, he was baptized into the Catholic Faith. He died on July 3, of acute nephritis and complications from cirrhosis of the liver. In his obituary, the \"New York Times Book Review\" echoed Roosevelt's sentiment, stating: \"Uncle Remus cannot die. Joel Chandler Harris has departed this life at the age of 60 ... but his best creation, [Uncle Remus] with his fund of folk-lore, will live in literature.\"\nWriting.\nFolklore.\nHarris created the first version of the Uncle Remus character for \"The Atlanta Constitution\" in 1876 after inheriting a column formerly written by Samuel W. Small, who had taken leave from the paper. In these character sketches, Remus would visit the newspaper office to discuss the social and racial issues of the day. By 1877, Small had returned to the \"Constitution\" and resumed his column.\nHarris did not intend to continue the Remus character. But when Small left the paper again, Harris reprised Remus. He realized the literary value of the stories he had heard from the slaves of Turnwold Plantation. Harris set out to record the stories and insisted that they be verified by two independent sources before he would publish them. He found the research more difficult given his professional duties, urban location, race and, eventually, fame.\nOn July 20, 1879, Harris published \"The Story of Mr. Rabbit and Mr. Fox as Told by Uncle Remus\" in \"The Atlanta Constitution\". It was the first of 34 plantation fables that would be compiled in \"Uncle Remus: His Songs and His Sayings\" (1880). The stories, mostly collected directly from the African-American oral storytelling tradition, were revolutionary in their use of dialect, animal personages, and serialized landscapes.\nRemus' stories featured a trickster hero called Br'er Rabbit (Brother Rabbit), who used his wits against adversity, though his efforts did not always succeed. Br'er Rabbit is a direct interpretation of Yoruba tales of Hare, though some others posit Native American influences as well. The scholar Stella Brewer Brookes asserts, \"Never has the trickster been better exemplified than in the Br'er Rabbit of Harris.\" Br'er Rabbit was accompanied by friends and enemies, such as Br'er Fox, Br'er Bear, Br'er Terrapin, and Br'er Wolf. The stories represented a significant break from the fairy tales of the Western tradition: instead of a singular event in a singular story, the critters on the plantation existed in an ongoing community saga, time immemorial.\nThe Uncle Remus stories garnered critical acclaim and achieved popular success well into the 20th century. Harris published at least twenty-nine books, of which nine books were compiled of his published Uncle Remus stories, including ' (1880), \"Nights with Uncle Remus\" (1883), \"Uncle Remus and His Friends\" (1892), \"The Tar Baby and Other Rhymes of Uncle Remus\" (1904), ' (1905), \"Uncle Remus and Brer Rabbit\" (1907). The last three books written by Joel Chandler Harris were published after his death which included \"Uncle Remus and the Little Boy\" (1910), \"Uncle Remus Returns\" (1918), and \"Seven Tales of Uncle Remus\" (1948). The tales, 185 in sum, became immensely popular among both black and white readers in the North and South. Few people outside of the South had heard accents like those spoken in the tales, and the dialect had never been legitimately and faithfully recorded in print. To Northern and international readers, the stories were a \"revelation of the unknown.\" Mark Twain noted in 1883, \"in the matter of writing [the African-American dialect], he is the only master the country has produced.\"\nThe stories introduced international readers to the American South. Rudyard Kipling wrote in a letter to Harris that the tales \"ran like wild fire through an English Public school. ... [We] found ourselves quoting whole pages of Uncle Remus that had got mixed in with the fabric of the old school life.\" The Uncle Remus tales have since been translated into more than forty languages.\nJames Weldon Johnson called the collection \"the greatest body of folklore America has produced\".\nJournalism.\nEarly in his career at the \"Atlanta Constitution\", Joe Harris laid out his editorial ideology and set the tone for an agenda that aimed to help reconcile issues of race, class, and region: \"An editor must have a purpose. ... What a legacy for one's conscience to know that one has been instrumental in mowing down the old prejudices that rattle in the wind like weeds.\"\nHarris served as assistant editor and lead editorial writer at \"The Atlanta Constitution\" primarily between 1876 and 1900. He published articles intermittently until his death in 1908. While at the \"Constitution\", Harris, \"in thousands of signed and unsigned editorials over a twenty-four-year period, ... set a national tone for reconciliation between North and South after the Civil War\".\nThroughout his career, Harris actively promoted racial reconciliation as well as African-American education, suffrage, and equality. He regularly denounced racism among southern whites, condemned lynching, and highlighted the importance of higher education for African Americans, frequently citing the work of W.E.B. Du Bois in his editorials. In 1883, for example, the \"New York Sun\" had an editorial: \"educating the negro will merely increase his capacity for evil.\" \"The Atlanta Constitution\" editorial countered with: if \"education of the negro is not the chief solution of the problem that confronts the white people of the South then there is no other conceivable solution and there is nothing ahead but political chaos and demoralization.\"\nHarris's editorials were often progressive in content and paternalistic in tone. He was committed to the \"dissipation of sectional jealousy and misunderstanding, as well as religious and racial intolerance\", yet \"never entirely freed himself of the idea that the [southern whites] would have to patronize the [southern blacks].\"\nHarris also oversaw some of \"The Atlanta Constitution\"'s most sensationalized coverage of racial issues, including the 1899 torture and lynching of Sam Hose, an African-American farm worker. Harris resigned from the paper the following year, having lost patience for publishing both \"his iconoclastic views on race\" and \"what was expected of him\" at a major southern newspaper during a particularly vitriolic period.\nIn 1904 Harris wrote four important articles for \"The Saturday Evening Post\" discussing the problem of race relations in the South; these highlighted his progressive yet paternalistic views. Of these, Booker T. Washington wrote to him:\nIt has been a long time since I have read anything from the pen of any man which has given me such encouragement as your article has. ... In a speech on Lincoln's Birthday which I am to deliver in New York, I am going to take the liberty to quote liberally from what you have said.\nTwo years later, Harris and his son Julian founded what would become \"Uncle Remus's Home Magazine\". Harris wrote to Andrew Carnegie that its purpose would be to further \"the obliteration of prejudice against the blacks, the demand for a square deal, and the uplifting of both races so that they can look justice in the face without blushing.\" Circulation reached 240,000 within one year, making it one of the largest magazines in the country.\nOther works.\nHarris wrote novels, narrative histories, translations of French folklore, children's literature, and collections of stories depicting rural life in Georgia. The short stories \"Free Joe and the Rest of the World\", \"Mingo\", and \"At Teague Poteets\" are the most influential of his non-Uncle Remus creative work. Many of his short stories delved into the changing social and economic values in the South during Reconstruction. Harris's turn as a local colorist gave voice to poor white characters and demonstrated his fluency with different African-American dialects and characters.\nLegacy.\nHarris' books exerted a profound influence on storytellers at home and abroad, yet the Uncle Remus tales effectively have no critical standing. His legacy is, at the same time, not without controversy: Harris' critical reputation in the 20th and 21st Centuries has been mixed, as some accused him of appropriating African-American culture.\nCriticism.\nCritic H. L. Mencken held a less than favorable view of Harris:\nOnce upon a time a Georgian printed a couple of books that attracted notice, but immediately it turned out that he was little more than an amanuensis for the local blacks\u2014that his works were really the products, not of white Georgia, but of black Georgia. Writing afterward as a white man, he swiftly subsided into the fifth rank.\nKeith Cartwright, however, asserts, \"Harris might arguably be called the greatest single authorial force behind the literary development of African American folk matter and manner.\"\nIn 1981 the writer Alice Walker accused Harris of \"stealing a good part of my heritage\" in a searing essay called \"Uncle Remus, No Friend of Mine\". Toni Morrison wrote a novel called \"Tar Baby.\" Such a character appears in a folktale recorded by Harris. In interviews, Morrison said she learned the story from her family and owed no debt to him.\nScholars have questioned the authenticity of his main works, citing the difficulty that many white folklorists had in persuading African Americans to divulge their folklore. However, others note the similarity of African folk stories in several sources that are similar to the Brer Rabbit tales as published, which represent a folk genre. Examples include the Ila language \"Sulwe mbwakatizha Muzovu\" (\"Hare makes the elephant afraid\") in Smith &amp; Dale \"The Ila-Speaking Peoples of Northern Rhodesia\" volume 2, page 309. In the totally unrelated Kanuri or Bornuese culture in Northern Nigeria, such tales as a \"Fable of Jackal and a Hyena\" display similar themes quite in the Brer Rabbit manner. The difficulties in obtaining printed sources on the African languages may have inhibited these aspects of critical treatment. Some critical scholars cite Uncle Remus as a problematic and contradictory figure: sometimes a mouthpiece for white paternalism, sometimes a stereotype of the black entertainer, and sometimes poetically subversive.\nJulius Lester, a black folklorist and university professor, saw the Uncle Remus stories as important records of black folklore. He rewrote many of the Harris stories in an effort to elevate the subversive elements over the purportedly racist ones. Regarding the nature of the Uncle Remus character, Lester said,\nThere are no inaccuracies in Harris's characterization of Uncle Remus. Even the most cursory reading of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers' Project of the 1930s reveals that there were many slaves who fit the Uncle Remus mold.\nThe author Ralph Ellison was positive about Harris' work:\nAesop and Uncle Remus had taught us that comedy is a disguised form of philosophical instruction; and especially when it allows us to glimpse the animal instincts lying beneath the surface of our civilized affectations.\nSome 21st-century scholars have argued that the Uncle Remus tales satirized the very \"plantation school\" that some readers believed his work supported. Critic Robert Cochran noted: \"Harris went to the world as the trickster Brer Rabbit, and in the trickster Uncle Remus he projected both his sharpest critique of things as they were and the deepest image of his heart's desire.\" Harris omitted the Southern plantation house, disparaged the white Southern gentleman, and presented miscegenation in positive terms. He violated social codes and presented an ethos that would have otherwise shocked his reading audience. These recent acknowledgements echo early observations from Walter Hines Page, who wrote in 1884 that Harris \"hardly conceals his scorn for the old aristocracy\" and makes \"a sly thrust at the pompous life of the Old South.\"\nMore recently, the scholars Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Maria Tatar debated whether to include Uncle Remus stories in their 2017 volume, \"The Annotated African American Folktales\". Ultimately they decided on inclusion, along with a detailed preface on the critical issues surrounding Harris, race, and cultural appropriation.\nInfluence.\nChildren's literature analyst John Goldthwaite argues that the Uncle Remus tales are \"irrefutably the central event in the making of modern children's story.\" Harris's influence on British children's writers such as Kipling, Milne, Potter, Burgess and Blyton is substantial. His influence on modernism is less overt, but also evident in the works of Pound, Eliot, Joyce, and Faulkner.\nBeatrix Potter illustrated eight scenes from the Uncle Remus stories between 1893 and 1896, coinciding with her first drawings of Peter Rabbit. Potter's family had favored the Uncle Remus stories during her youth, and she was particularly impressed by the way Harris turned \"the ordinary into the extraordinary.\" Potter borrowed some of the language from the Uncle Remus stories, adopting the words: \"cottontail\", \"puddle-duck\", and \"lippity-(c)lippity\" into her own work.\nMark Twain incorporated several of the Uncle Remus stories into readings during his book tour. He wrote to William Dean Howells in the early 1880s, reporting that the \"Tar Baby\" had been received \"best of all\" at a reading in Hartford. Twain admired Harris' use of dialect. He appropriated exchanges and turns of phrase in many of his works, most notably in \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" and \"The Mysterious Stranger\".\nA.A. Milne borrowed diction, plot, and narrative structure from several Brer Rabbit stories. \"Pooh Goes Visiting\" and \"Heyo, House!\" are particularly similar. As a boy, Milne recalled listening to his father read one Uncle Remus story per night, and referred to it as \"the sacred book.\"\nCharles Chesnutt's most famous work, \"The Conjure Woman\", is strongly influenced by the Uncle Remus tales; he features Uncle Julius as the main character and storyteller. Chesnutt read the Uncle Remus stories to his own children.\nMany scholars cite Harris' influence on William Faulkner, most importantly in terms of dialect usage, depictions of African Americans, lower-class whites, and fictionalized landscape.\nPoets Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot corresponded in Uncle Remus-inspired dialect, referring to themselves as \"Brer Rabbit\" and \"Old Possum\", respectively. Eventually the dialect and the personae became a sign of their collaboration against the London literary establishment. Eliot titled one of his books \"Old Possum's Book of Practical Cats\".\nRalph Bakshi wrote and directed a 1975 American live action/animated crime film titled \"Coonskin\" based on Harris' Brothers rabbit, fox, and bear who rise to the top of the organized crime racket in Harlem, encountering corrupt law enforcement, con artists, and the Mafia.\n\"Song of the South\".\nIn 1946, The Walt Disney Company produced a film based on the Uncle Remus tales called \"Song of the South\". While commercially successful during its original release and re-releases, the film has never been released for home consumption in the United States as, since its release, the film was criticized for the way it portrays its characters and the Southern U. S. in regard to slavery, even though the film's events take place in the postbellum South, when slavery had ended. \"Song of the South\" has been released on video in a number of overseas markets, and on LaserDisc in Japan.\nThe film earned mixed critical reviews and two Academy Awards. James Baskett won an honorary Academy Award for his portrayal of Uncle Remus, and \"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\" was presented with the award for Best Original Song. Walter White of the NAACP acknowledged \"the remarkable artistic merit\" of the film in his telegraphed press release on November 27, 1946, but decried the \"impression it gives of an idyllic master-slave relationship.\"\nSince its debut, the public perception of Harris and the Uncle Remus stories has largely been tied to the reception of \"Song of the South\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The street has several major landmarks, including (from east to west) the headquarters of the United Nations, the Chrysler Building, Grand Central Terminal, the New York Public Library Main Branch, Times Square, and the Port Authority Bus Terminal.\nThe street is known for its theaters, especially near the intersection with Broadway at Times Square, and as such is also the name of the region of the theater district (and, at times, the red-light district) near that intersection. The street also has a section of off-Broadway theaters known as Theatre Row.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, a cornfield near 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue was where General George Washington angrily attempted to rally his troops after the British landing at Kip's Bay, which scattered many of the American militiamen. Washington's attempt put him in danger of being captured, and his officers had to persuade him to leave. The rout eventually subsided into an orderly retreat.\nJohn Jacob Astor purchased a farm in 1803 that ran from 42nd Street to 46th Street west of Broadway to the Hudson River.\n19th century.\nThe street was designated by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 that established the Manhattan street grid as one of 15 crosstown (east-west) streets that would be in width, while other streets were designated as in width.\nIn 1835, the city's Street Committee, after receiving numerous complaints about lack of access for development above 14th Street, decided to open up all lots which had already been plotted on the city grid up to 42nd Street, which thus became \u2013 for a time \u2013 the northern boundary of the city.\nCornelius Vanderbilt began the construction of Grand Central Depot in 1869 on 42nd Street at Fourth Avenue as the terminal for his Central, Hudson, Harlem and New Haven commuter rail lines, because city regulations required that trains be pulled by horse below 42nd Street. The Depot, which opened in 1871, was replaced by Grand Central Terminal in 1913.\nBetween the 1870s and 1890s, 42nd Street became the uptown boundary of the mainstream theater district, which started around 23rd Street, as the entertainment district of the Tenderloin gradually moved northward.\nEarly 20th century.\n42nd Street was developed relatively late compared to other crosstown thoroughfares such as 14th Street and 23rd Street, which had grown during the American Civil War, and 57th Street, which became prominent in the 1890s. It was only after the beginning of the 20th century that the street saw entertainment venues being developed around Times Square and upscale office space around Grand Central Terminal. In the first two decades of the 20th century, eleven venues for legitimate theater were built within one block of West 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.\nThe corner of 42nd Street and Broadway, at the southeast corner of Times Square, is the eastern terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across the United States, which was conceived and mapped in 1913.\nAn elevated railroad line, running above East 42nd Street from Third Avenue to the Grand Central station, was closed in 1923, leading to the development of such structures as the Chanin Building and 110 East 42nd Street west of Lexington Avenue. The street east of Lexington Avenue continued to be made up of mostly low-rise buildings; these blocks were adjacent to the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line and IRT Third Avenue Line, and accordingly, initially considered unattractive for major development. By the 1920s, \"The New York Times\" reported that several high-rise developments were \"radically changing the old-time conditions\" along East 42nd Street, including the Chanin, Lincoln, Chrysler, and Daily News Buildings, as well as Tudor City.\nThe block of 42nd Street between Second and First Avenues was originally only wide, passing through a steep bluff known as Prospect Hill. On either side of the street, service roads ascended to Tudor City Place, which crossed over 42nd Street. To improve access to the newly developed United Nations headquarters, in 1948, the city government proposed widening that block of 42nd Street, eliminating the service roads, and constructing a viaduct to carry Tudor City Place over 42nd Street. Despite opposition from Tudor City residents, city officials said the street widening was necessary because 42nd Street already carried high amounts of vehicular traffic to and from the nearby FDR Drive. The New York City Planning Commission approved the plans in September 1948, and the Board of Estimate approved $1.848 million for the project that December. The board provisionally authorized the street widening in June 1949, and Manhattan's borough president announced in December 1949 that work would commence shortly. The neighboring stretch of 42nd Street was temporarily closed from February 1951 to October 1952 while the widening was underway.\nTheatrical decline.\nWest 42nd Street, meanwhile, prospered as a theater and entertainment district until World War II. According to historian Robert A. M. Stern, West 42nd Street's decline started in 1946, when the streetcars on 42nd Street were replaced by less efficient buses.\nLloyd Bacon and Busby Berkeley's 1933 film musical \"42nd Street\", starring 30s heartthrobs Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, displays the bawdy and colorful mixture of Broadway denizens and lowlifes in Manhattan during the Depression. In 1980, it was turned into a successful Broadway musical which ran until 1989, and which was revived for a four-year run in 2001. In the words of the Al Dubin and Harry Warren title song, on 42nd Street one could find:\nLittle nifties from the Fifties, innocent and sweet,\nSexy ladies from the Eighties who are indiscreet,\nThey're side by side, they're glorified,\nWhere the underworld can meet the elite\nNaughty, gawdy, bawdy, sporty, Forty-second Street!\nFrom the late 1950s until the late 1980s, 42nd Street, nicknamed the \"Deuce\", was the cultural center of American grindhouse theaters, which spawned an entire subculture. The book \"Sleazoid Express\", a travelogue of the 42nd Street grindhouses and the films they showed, describes the unique blend of people who made up the theater-goers:\ndepressives hiding from jobs, sexual obsessives, inner-city people seeking cheap diversions, teenagers skipping school, adventurous couples on dates, couples-chasers peeking on them, people getting high, homeless people sleeping, pickpockets...\nWhile the street outside the theaters was populated with:\nphony drug salesman ... low-level drug dealers, chain snatchers ... [j]unkies alone in their heroin/cocaine dreamworld ... predatory chickenhawks spying on underage trade looking for pickups ... male prostitutes of all ages ... [t]ranssexuals, hustlers, and closety gays with a fetishistic homo- or heterosexual itch to scratch ... It was common to see porn stars whose films were playing at the adult houses promenade down the block. ... Were you a freak? Not when you stepped onto the Deuce. Being a freak there would get you money, attention, entertainment, a starring part in a movie. Or maybe a robbery and a beating.\nFor much of the mid and late 20th century, the area of 42nd Street near Times Square was home to activities often considered unsavory, including peep shows.\nEast 42nd Street was, for some time, spared from similar decline, especially east of Third Avenue, where the development of the United Nations supported a thriving business district and prompted the widening of that section of 42nd Street. The demolition of the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines by the 1950s led to increased development on East 42nd Street, such as annexes to the Chrysler and Daily News Buildings, as well as the construction of the Socony\u2013Mobil and Ford Foundation Buildings. By the 1960s, East 42nd Street between Park and Second Avenues contained more headquarters of industries than any other place in the United States except Chicago or Pittsburgh. During this time, there was much development outside the rundown entertainment district of Times Square, somewhat offsetting the perception of that part of 42nd Street.\nRevitalization.\nIn the early 1990s, the city government encouraged a cleanup of the Times Square area. In 1990, the city government took over six of the historic theaters on the block of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, and New 42nd Street, a not-for-profit organization, was formed to oversee their renovation and reuse, as well as to construct new theaters and a rehearsal space. In 1993, Disney Theatrical Productions bought the New Amsterdam Theatre, which it renovated a few years later. Since the mid-1990s, the block has again become home to mainstream theaters and several multi-screen mainstream movie theaters, along with shops, restaurants, hotels, and attractions such as Madame Tussauds wax museum and Ripley's Believe It or Not that draw millions to the city every year. This area is now co-signed as \"New 42nd Street\" to signify this change.\nIn the 1990s, the renovation of Bryant Park between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, as well as the renovations of Times Square and Grand Central Terminal, led to increases in office occupancy along both sections of 42nd Street.\nIn 2025, the New York City Department of Transportation announced that the block of 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues would be upgraded to protect it from terrorist attacks. The project, budgeted at $57 million, would include adding steel bollards, installing sewage pipes, and widening the sidewalks and bus lanes.\nNotable places.\n(from East to West):\nTransportation.\nSubway.\nEvery New York City Subway line that crosses 42nd Street has a stop on 42nd Street:\nThere are two subway lines under 42nd Street. The 42nd Street Shuttle ( S trains) runs under 42nd Street between Broadway/Seventh Avenue (Times Square) and Park Avenue (Grand Central). The IRT Flushing Line ( 7 and &lt;7&gt;\u200btrains) curves from Eleventh Avenue to 41st Street, under which it runs until Fifth Avenue; shifts to 42nd Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues; and continues under the East River to Queens. Each line stops at Times Square and Grand Central, though the Fifth Avenue station is also served by the 7 and &lt;7&gt;\u200btrains.\nIn the past, every former IRT elevated line had a station at 42nd Street:\nA fifth station extended over 42nd Street as a western spur from the Third Avenue Line to Grand Central Depot, later Grand Central Station, and finally Grand Central Terminal.\nBus.\nMTA Regional Bus Operations's M42 bus runs the length of 42nd Street between the Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises ferry terminal on the Hudson River and the headquarters of the United Nations on the East River. Westbound service originates at First Avenue. Its predecessor, the 42nd Street Crosstown Line streetcar, had used 42nd Street until 1946. In 2019, bus lanes were installed along the length of the street. There have also been proposals for light rail on 42nd Street over the years, such as in 2005.\n42nd Street is also used by the Staten Island express buses.\nIn popular culture.\n\"Dorty-deuce\" is street slang for Manhattan's former live peep show district on 42nd Street. The 1982 film \"Forty Deuce\" and the 2017 TV series \"The Deuce\" reference the phrase \"forty-deuce\".\nNotable CCP Politburo Standing Committee member Wang Huning referenced 42nd Street in his book America Against America mentioning it's \"pornographic culture\" as an example of the \"decadence of high commodification\".\nAn unspecified 42nd Street Subway Station is featured in \"\" as the stage, \"Subway Station\". Two versions of this stage exist for the characters Alex and Ken Masters. Alex's version is in a bright orange tint and features construction equipment, while Ken's version has a blue tint and is clear of equipment. The famous Evo Moment 37 occurred on the Subway Station stage since Ken was the challenging player.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography\nFurther reading"}

First published in 1929, it is a first-person account of an American, Frederic Henry, serving as a lieutenant () in the ambulance corps of the Italian Army. The novel describes a love affair between the American expatriate and an English nurse, Catherine Barkley.\nIts publication ensured Hemingway's place as a modern American writer of considerable stature. The book became his first best-seller and has been called \"the premier American war novel from [...] World War\u00a0I\". The title might be taken from a 16th\u2011century poem of the same name by the English dramatist George Peele.\nThe novel has been adapted a number of times: initially for the stage in 1930; as a film in 1932, and again in 1957; and as a three-part television miniseries in 1966. The film \"In Love and War\", made in 1996, depicts Hemingway's life in Italy as an ambulance driver in events prior to his writing of \"A Farewell to Arms\".\nSince 2025, \"A Farewell to Arms\" has been in the public domain.\nPlot summary.\nThe novel is divided into five sections, or \"books\". Frederic Henry narrates the story in the first person.\nBook One.\nLieutenant Frederic Henry is an American medic serving in the Italian Army, who speaks Italian. The novel begins during the First World War. It is the start of winter, when a cholera epidemic kills thousands of soldiers. Frederic visits Gorizia, where he meets other army fellows and the priest. He finds there are two brothels\u00a0\u2013 one for officers and the other for lower-rank soldiers. On his return, he shares his experience with his friend, Surgeon Rinaldi, who is about the same age as Frederic.\nRinaldi is fond of beautiful women. He has fallen in love with an English nurse named Catherine Barkley, though not so seriously. Rinaldi takes Frederic to a British hospital, where Frederic is introduced to, and attracted to, Catherine. She tells him about her fianc\u00e9, who was killed in battle, and also about feeling uncomfortable in the rain, as it starts to rain. Frederic tries to kiss her, but she refuses and slaps him. She regrets doing so and eventually warms to him and they kiss.\nFrederic and his fellow drivers (Passini, Manera, Gordini and Gavuzzi) take the ambulance toward the front line. Passini is killed in a mortar attack. Frederic is severely wounded in the knee on the Italian front and is sent to the hospital.\nBook Two.\nSurgeon Rinaldi visits Frederic in the hospital and praises him for his heroism, but Frederic denies any display of such. Rinaldi also tells him that he will be shifted to a hospital in Milan soon for a better treatment. Frederic requests him to have Catherine there as a nurse. The priest pays a visit. In a discussion again, Frederic expresses his views against war. Meanwhile, America has declared war on Germany, and the Italian army is also anxious about war against Austria. Frederic reaches an American hospital in Milan. There he is nursed by Miss Gage, Mrs.\u00a0Walker and their Superintendent Miss Van Campen. Miss Gage arranges wine for him. Catherine arrives there, and Frederic realizes a strong sense of love and passion for her. They make love for the first time. Doctor Valentini comes to examine his injury and X-rays. This book portrays the growth of Frederic's relationship with Catherine over the summer. They enjoy boating and horse races. Meanwhile, Frederic meets Helen Ferguson, a fellow nurse of Catherine. After his knee heals, Frederic is diagnosed with jaundice. A three-week convalescent leave is sanctioned for him. Miss Van Campen discovers empty liquor bottles in Frederic's room and takes alcoholism as the cause for his condition. She also concludes that Frederic is knowingly keeping himself ill to avoid the war front. She files a report for the cancellation of convalescent leave, and Frederic is called back to the war front. Catherine informs him that she is three months pregnant. They promise to reunite and marry after his return from war. Frederic asks her to take care of \"Little Catherine\".\nBook Three.\nFrederic returns to Gorizia. Rinaldi comes and examines his wounded leg. He further asks whether they have married or not. The priest notices a change in Frederic and also predicts that the war will end soon. Frederic travels to Bainsizza, where he meets Gino, who tells him about an artillery battery of terrifying guns that the Austrians have. Frederic realizes that Italians will not escape if the Austrians attack. It rains heavily, and the bombarding begins. Frederic discovers that morale has severely dropped. Not long afterwards, the Austro-Hungarians break through the Italian lines in the Battle of Caporetto, and the Italians retreat. The houses are evacuated. Women and children are loaded in trucks. At the villa, Frederic discovers that Rinaldi has taken off for the hospital; everyone else has evacuated too. There is considerable delay and chaos on the road during the retreat, and Frederic, wishing to avoid a possible aerial attack while stuck on the main retreat route, decides to take an alternate path. He and his men quickly get lost, and their cars are stuck in the mud, Frederic orders the two engineering sergeants riding with Bonello to help. Afraid of being overtaken by the enemy, they refuse and try to leave. Frederic draws his gun and shoots one of them; the other escapes. One of the drivers, Aymo, is later killed, while another, Bonello, runs away to surrender to the Austrians. Frederic and his last companion, Piani, catch up to the main retreat across the Tagliamento river. As soon as they cross the bridge, Frederic is taken by the military police to a place on the river bank where officers are being interrogated and executed for the \"treachery\" that supposedly led to the Italian defeat. Frederic escapes by jumping into the river. Afterwards, he walks through the plains and jumps aboard a moving train to Milan to find Catherine.\nBook Four.\nReaching Milan, he learns that Catherine has left for Stresa. He goes to visit Ralph Simmons, one of the opera singers that he encountered earlier, and asks about the procedures for traveling to Switzerland. Ralph helps him, giving him civilian clothes. Frederic feels very odd in those clothes, as the people look at him scornfully. He reaches Stresa by train and goes to the Grand Hotel des Iles Borrom\u00e9es. Emilio, a bartender, informs him that two English nurses are staying at a small hotel near the train station. Frederic meets Catherine and Helen Ferguson there. He also meets Count Greffi, a very old nobleman whom Frederic had met on his last visit to Stresa. Greffi is staying with his niece. Frederic avoids Catherine's question about the war experiences. He feels that he is a criminal, a war deserter. Emilio informs him that Italian police are looking to arrest him. Catherine and Frederic plan to flee to Switzerland as Emilio makes all possible arrangements for their travel in a rowboat. Because of a storm, the waters are choppy and rough. Frederic rows the boat all night, and Catherine also takes a turn rowing. Finally, they reach Switzerland. The guards verify their identity and provide them provisional visas for staying in Switzerland.\nBook Five.\nFrederic and Catherine live a quiet life in the mountains. They move to a wooden house on a mountain outside the village of Montreux. They develop new acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs.\u00a0Guttingen. At times, Catherine starts getting concerned about their child, especially about its health. They move to the town of Lausanne to be closer to the hospital. Later, Catherine goes into labor and is taken to the hospital. The doctor tells Frederic that the best solution would be a caesarean operation. She suffers a lot of pain and finally delivers a stillborn baby boy. Later the nurse tells him that Catherine is hemorrhaging. He is terrified. He goes to see her, and she dies with him by her side. He leaves the hospital and walks back to his hotel in the rain.\nBackground and publication history.\nThe novel was partly based on Hemingway's own experiences serving in the Italian campaigns during the First World War. The inspiration for Catherine Barkley was Agnes von Kurowsky, a nurse who cared for Hemingway in a hospital in Milan after he had been wounded. He had planned to marry her, but she spurned his love when he returned to America. Kitty Cannell, a Paris-based fashion correspondent, became Helen Ferguson. The unnamed priest was based on Don Giuseppe Bianchi, the priest of the 69th and 70th regiments of the Brigata Ancona. Although the sources for Rinaldi are unknown, the character had already appeared in \"In Our Time\".\nMuch of the plot was written in correspondence with Frederic J.\u00a0Agate. Agate, Hemingway's friend, had a collection of letters to his wife from his time in Italy, which were later used as inspiration.\nMichael Reynolds, however, writes that Hemingway was not involved in the battles described. Because his previous novel, \"The Sun Also Rises\", had been written as a \"roman \u00e0 clef\", readers assumed \"A Farewell to Arms\" to be autobiographical.\n\"A Farewell to Arms\" was begun during his time at Willis M.\u00a0Spear's guest ranch in Wyoming's Bighorns. Some pieces of the novel were written in Piggott, Arkansas, at the home of his then-wife Pauline Pfeiffer, and in Mission Hills, Kansas, while she was awaiting delivery of their baby. Pauline underwent a caesarean section as Hemingway was writing the scene about Catherine Barkley's childbirth.\nHemingway struggled with the ending. By his count, he wrote 39 versions of it \"before [he] was satisfied\". However, a 2012 edition of the book included no fewer than 47 alternate endings.\nThe novel was first serialized in \"Scribner's Magazine\" in the May 1929 to October 1929 issues. The book was published in September 1929 with a first edition print-run of approximately 31,000 copies. The success of \"A Farewell to Arms\" made Hemingway financially independent.\n\"The Hemingway Library Edition\" was released in July 2012, with a dust jacket facsimile of the first edition. The newly published edition presents an appendix with the many alternate endings Hemingway wrote for the novel in addition to pieces from early draft manuscripts.\nThe John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum Hemingway collection has two handwritten pages with possible titles for the book. Most of the titles come from \"The Oxford Book of English Verse\". One of the possible titles Hemingway considered was \"In Another Country and Besides\". This comes from \"The Jew of Malta\" by Christopher Marlowe. The poem \"Portrait of a Lady\" by T.\u00a0S. Eliot also starts off by quoting this Marlowe work: \"Thou hast committed\u00a0/ Fornication: but that was in another country,\u00a0/ And besides, the wench is dead.\" Hemingway's library included both works by Eliot and Marlowe.\nCensorship.\nWhen \"A Farewell to Arms\" was first serialized, certain words were censored and parts of the story were excised for brevity. While the 1929 novel publication restored the previously removed passages, the adult language remained censored. There are at least two copies of the first edition into which Hemingway had re-inserted the censored text by hand to provide a corrected text. One of these copies was presented to Maurice Coindreau, the other to James Joyce. Hemingway's corrected text was finally inserted into a 2025 edition of the novel, and there are some audiobook versions that are uncensored.\n\"A Farewell to Arms\" was banned in the Irish Free State.\nAlso, the novel could not be published in Italy until 1948 because the Fascist regime considered it detrimental to the honor of the Armed Forces, both in its description of the Battle of Caporetto and because of a certain anti-militarism implied in the work. More than one biographer has suggested that, at the base of the censorship of the Fascist regime in the novel, there had also been a personal antipathy between the writer and Benito Mussolini. Hemingway had interviewed him in 1923, shortly after he had seized power, and in Hemingway's article in the \"Toronto Star\" he poured scorn on Mussolini, calling him \"the biggest bluff in Europe\". But, apart from the official reactions, it is known that Mussolini did not like the article at all: Hemingway described Mussolini as trying to impress the media by pretending to be deeply absorbed in reading, while in reality he was holding a French\u2013English dictionary upside down. The Italian translation had in fact already been prepared illegally in 1943 by Fernanda Pivano, leading to her arrest in Turin.\nCritical reception.\n\"A Farewell to Arms\" was met with favorable criticism and is considered one of Hemingway's best literary works.\nGore Vidal wrote of the text: \"...\u00a0a work of ambition, in which can be seen the beginning of the careful, artful, immaculate idiocy of tone that since has marked\u00a0... [Hemingway's] prose\". The last line of the 1929 \"New York Times\" review reads: \"It is a moving and beautiful book.\"\nBaker remarks on the theme of \"A Farewell to Arms\": \"After ten years of meditation and digestive of his experience, Hemingway lays before his readers a work which is far from a mere war experience, nor a story of love and death during the war.\"\nHowever, since publication, \"A Farewell to Arms\" has also been the target of various controversies. Upon its flimsy publication\u2014due to the medium of its release\u2014through \"Scribner's Magazine\", it was banned from Boston newsstands due to accusations of a pornographic nature, despite Hemingway's deliberate exclusion of graphic descriptions of sex, using omission as a literary device.\nIn other media.\nThe novel was first adapted for the stage by Laurence Stallings in 1930, then as a film in 1932, with a 1957 remake. A three-part television miniseries was made in 1966. In December 2023, a new film adaptation was announced, with Michael Winterbottom to direct and Tom Blyth to star.\nThe 1996 film \"In Love and War\", directed by Richard Attenborough and starring Chris O'Donnell and Sandra Bullock, depicts Hemingway's life in Italy as an ambulance driver in the events prior to his writing of \"A Farewell to Arms\".\nA radio broadcast adaption was produced in 1937 as part of the Lux Radio Theater series, starring Clark Gable and Josephine Hutchinson. In 2011, BBC Radio 4 produced a 10-episode adaptation for their \"15 Minute Drama\" series.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was released on November 10, 1932. The film received critical acclaim and was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor for Muni.\nThe film was written by Howard J. Green and Brown Holmes from Robert Elliott Burns's 1932 autobiography of a similar name \"I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!\" originally serialized in the \"True Detective\" magazine. The true life story was later the basis for the television movie \"The Man Who Broke 1,000 Chains\" (1987) starring Val Kilmer.\nIn 1991, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nWhite American sergeant James Allen returns to civilian life after World War I. He has served with distinction, earning a medal from Allied governments for his bravery, but his war experience has made him restless. His mother and minister brother feel Allen should be grateful for a tedious office clerk job. When he announces that he wants to enter the construction industry and improve society as an engineer, his brother reacts with outrage, but his mother regretfully accepts his ambitions.\nHe leaves home to find work, but unskilled labor is plentiful, and it is hard for him to find a job. Allen sinks slowly into poverty. In an unnamed Southern state (the events upon which the film was based took place in Georgia), Allen visits a diner with an acquaintance, who forces him at gunpoint to participate in a robbery. The police arrive and shoot and kill his friend. Allen panics and attempts to flee but is caught immediately.\nAllen is tried and sentenced to prison with hard labor. He is quickly exposed to the brutal conditions of life on a chain gang. The work is agonizing, and the guards are cruel and sadistically whip prisoners for poor performance. Allen makes friends among the gang members, most notably Bomber Wells, an older murderer and chain gang veteran. The two conspire to stage a breakout.\nWhile working on a railroad, Allen receives assistance from Sebastian T. Yale, a powerfully built prisoner who damages Allen's shackles by hammering them with Allen's ankles still inside. The following Monday, while on a \"bathroom break,\" Allen slips out of his chains and runs. Armed guards and bloodhounds give chase, but Allen evades them by changing clothes and hiding at the bottom of a river. He makes it to a nearby town, where he is given money for a train ticket and a room for the night by one of Bomber's friends.\nAllen makes his way to Chicago, where he obtains a job as a manual laborer and uses his knowledge of engineering and construction to rise to a position of importance within a construction company. Along the way, he becomes romantically involved with his landlady, Marie Woods. Allen grows to loathe Marie, but she discovers his secret and blackmails him into an unhappy marriage.\nTrying to forget his troubles, he attends a high-society party at the invitation of his superiors and meets and falls in love with a younger woman named Helen. Marie betrays him to the authorities when he asks for a divorce. Allen describes the inhumane conditions of the chain gangs to the press, becoming national news. Many common citizens express their disgust with the chain gangs and their sympathy for a reformed man such as Allen, while editorials written by Southerners describe his continued freedom as a violation of \"state's rights.\"\nThe governor of Illinois refuses to release Allen to the custody of the Southern state. Its officials offer Allen a deal: return voluntarily and receive a pardon after 90 days of easy clerical labor. Allen accepts, only to find the proposals were a ruse; he is sent to a chain gang, where he languishes for another year after being denied a pardon.\nReunited with Bomber, Allen decides to escape once more. The two steal a dump truck loaded with dynamite from a work site. While leaning out of his seat to taunt pursuing guards, Bomber gets shot. He takes some of the dynamite, lights it, and throws it at a police car, causing a minor landslide. Shortly afterward, Bomber falls from the truck and dies, causing Allen to stop the vehicle. Allen then uses more dynamite to blow up a bridge he just crossed, allowing him to make a close escape. Allen makes his way north again, evading a relentless manhunt.\nMonths later, he visits Helen in Chicago to wish her a permanent goodbye. Tearfully, she asks, \"Can't you tell me where you're going? Will you write? Do you need any money?\" Allen repeatedly shakes his head as he backs away. Finally, Helen says, \"But you must, Jim. How do you live?\" Allen's face is barely visible in the surrounding gloom as he replies, \"I steal,\" disappearing into the darkness.\nDevelopment and production.\nThe film was based on the book \"I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!\" (1932) written by Robert Elliott Burns and published by Vanguard Press. The book recounts Burns' service on a chain gang while imprisoned in Georgia in the 1920s, his subsequent escape and the furor that developed. The story was first published in January 1932, and serialized in \"True Detective\" mysteries magazine.\nDespite Jack L. Warner's and Darryl F. Zanuck's interest in adapting Burns's book, the Warner Bros. story department voted against it with a report that concluded: \"[T]his book might make a picture if we had no censorship, but all the strong and vivid points in the story are certain to be eliminated by the present censorship board.\" The story editor's reasons were mostly related to the story's violence and the uproar that was sure to explode in the Deep South. In the end, Warner and Zanuck had the final say and approved the project.\nRoy Del Ruth, the highest-paid director at Warner Bros., was assigned to direct, but he refused the assignment. In a lengthy memo to supervising producer Hal B. Wallis, Del Ruth explained his decision: \"This subject is heavy and morbid...there is not one moment of relief anywhere.\" Del Ruth further argued that the story \"lacks box-office appeal,\" and that offering a depressing story to the public seemed ill-timed, given the harsh reality of the Great Depression outside the walls of the local neighborhood cinema. Mervyn LeRoy, who was at that time directing \"42nd Street\" (released in 1933), dropped out of the shooting and left the reins to Lloyd Bacon.\nLeRoy cast Paul Muni in the role of James Allen after seeing him in a stage production of \"Counsellor at Law\". Muni was not impressed with LeRoy upon first meeting him in the Warner Burbank office, but Muni and LeRoy became close friends. LeRoy was present at Muni's funeral in 1967 along with Muni's agent.\nTo prepare for the role, Muni conducted several intensive meetings with Robert E. Burns in Burbank to learn how Burns walked and talked, in essence, to catch \"the smell of fear.\" Muni stated to Burns: \"I don't want to imitate you; I want to be you.\" Muni set the Warner Bros. research department on a quest to procure every available book and magazine article about the penal system. He also met with several California prison guards, even one who had worked on a Southern chain gang. Muni fancied the idea of meeting with a guard or warden still working in Georgia, but Warner studio executives quickly rejected his suggestion.\nThe final lines in the film, \"But you must, Jim. How do you live? I steal\", are among the most famous closing lines in American film. Director Mervyn LeRoy later claimed that the idea for James' retreat into darkness came to him when a fuse blew on the set, but it had been written into the script.\nBox office.\nAccording to Warner Bros. Records, the film earned $650,000 domestically and $949,000 foreign, making it the studio's third-highest success of 1932\u201333 after \"Gold Diggers of 1933\" and \"Forty Second Street\".\nCritical reception.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 96%, based on reviews from 27 critics.\n\"Variety\" reviewer Abel Green wrote in November 1932 that it \"is a picture with guts. It grips with its stark realism and packs lots of punch.\" And that \"The finale is stark in its realism.\" The review said, \"Muni turns in a pip performance.\" \"Variety\" also included a \"Miniature\" and \"The Woman's Angle\" reviews.\nFrederick James Smith in \"Liberty\" in November 1932 gave the film the top score of 4 stars, \"extraordinary\". \"Paul Muni is splendid as the chain-gang victim. All the other roles are well done, but they are incidental to Muni and Mervyn Le Roy's tense, vigorous direction.\"\n\"The New Republic\" wrote in December 1932 that it \"is one of the finest to come from Hollywood in many a day. It tells with unflinching realism how chain-gang prisoners are treated and at the same time through its direction and acting it is raised far above the level of mere journalistic exposure. It will bring home the conditions among prisoners to millions of persons\".\nJeremiah Kipp of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote in 2005, \"Th[e] soul-crushing horrors of slave labor in the penal system are neatly interwoven into a highly gripping plot.\" But Kipp thought, \"It feels more like an uncompromising prison film than a message movie, so its frequent heavy-handedness seems more like unabashed pulp rather than sanctimony.\"\nKim Newman wrote in 2006 for \"Empire\", \"The most powerful of Warner Brothers\u2019 early 1930s \u2018social problem\u2019 films, this indictment of organised cruelty remains potent, hard-hitting melodrama.\" And he said it was a \"Suprisingly [\"sic\"] no-holds-barred portrait of institutional bullying for such an early film.\"\nImpact on American society.\nThe film is among the first examples of cinema used to garner sympathy for imprisoned convicts without divulging the actual crimes of the convicts. American audiences began to question the legitimacy of the U.S. legal system, and in January 1933, the film's protagonist Robert Elliott Burns, who was still imprisoned in New Jersey, and several other chain gang prisoners nationwide in the U.S., were able to appeal and were released. In January 1933, Georgia chain gang warden J. Harold Hardy, who was also made into a character in the film, sued the studio for one million dollars for displaying \"vicious, brutal and false attacks\" against him in the film.\nAwards and nominations.\nAcademy Award Nominations:\nNational Board of Review Award:\nOther Wins:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The screenplay by Robert Riskin is based on the 1929 short story \"Madame La Gimp\" by Damon Runyon. It was the first film for which Capra received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director and the first Columbia Pictures release to be nominated for Best Picture. Capra also directed its 1961 remake, \"Pocketful of Miracles\".\nPlot.\nThe story focuses on Apple Annie (May Robson), an aging and wretched fruit seller in New York City, whose daughter Louise (Jean Parker) has been raised in a Spanish convent since she was an infant. Louise has been led to believe her mother is a society matron named Mrs. E. Worthington Manville who lives at the Hotel Marberry. Annie discovers her charade is in danger of being uncovered when she learns Louise is sailing to New York with her fianc\u00e9 Carlos (Barry Norton) and his father, Count Romero (Walter Connolly).\nAmong Annie's patrons are Dave the Dude (Warren William), a gambling gangster who believes her apples bring him good luck, and his henchman Happy McGuire (Ned Sparks). Annie's friends from the street ask Dave to rent her an apartment at the Marberry and, although he initially declines, he has a change of heart and arranges for her to live in the lap of luxury in a palatial residence belonging to a friend. His girlfriend, nightclub owner Missouri Martin (Glenda Farrell), helps transform Annie from a dowdy street peddler to an elegant dowager. Dave arranges for erudite pool hustler Henry D. Blake (Guy Kibbee) to pose as Annie's second husband, the dignified Judge Manville.\nAt the pier, an elegantly dressed Annie tearfully reunites with Louise. A group of Annie's friends from the streets are watching from a distance. One of the street people says that she can remember when Annie \u201calways looked like that.\u201d (We never know the details of Annie's history, but her upper-crust origins are clear.) When three society reporters become suspicious about Mrs. E. Worthington Manville, of whom they can find no public records, they are kidnapped by members of Dave's gang, and their prolonged disappearance leads the local newspapers to accuse the police department of incompetence.\nA few days later, Blake \u2013 in the role of Judge Manville \u2013 announces he is planning a gala reception for Louise, Carlos, and Count Romero before they return to Spain, and he enlists Dave's guys and Missouri's dolls to pose as Annie's society friends. On the night of the reception, the police \u2013 certain Dave is responsible for the missing reporters \u2013 surround Missouri's club, where the gang has assembled for a final rehearsal. Dave calls Blake to advise him of their predicament, and Annie decides to confess everything to Count Romero. But fate \u2013 in the form of a sympathetic mayor and governor and their entourages \u2013 unexpectedly steps in and allows Annie to maintain her charade and keep Louise from learning the truth before she sails back to Spain with her husband-to-be.\nProduction.\nDamon Runyon's short story \"Madame La Gimp\" was published in the October 1929 issue of \"Cosmopolitan\". Columbia Pictures purchased the screen rights in September 1932, and the studio scheduled the production to begin the following May, although director Frank Capra had misgivings about the project. He reminded studio head Harry Cohn he was \"spending three hundred thousand dollars on a picture in which the heroine is seventy years old,\" to which Cohn responded, \"All I know is the thing's got a wallop. Go ahead.\" Robert Riskin was assigned to develop the story for the screen and wrote four drafts, submitting the last on May 6, 1933, three days before principal photography began. Aside from some minor revisions made during production, this final script was filmed intact. Riskin's version deviated from the original Runyon story primarily in that it linked its central character and a number of plot developments to the millions of Americans who were suffering as a result of the Great Depression. Runyon was pleased with the changes and later said, \"\"Lady for a Day\" was no more my picture than \"Little Miss Marker\", which, like the former picture, was almost entirely the result of the genius of the scenario writers and the director who worked on it.\"\nRiskin had written his screenplay specifically for Robert Montgomery, but MGM refused to loan him to Columbia. He was among several performers Capra wanted but failed to secure for roles in the film. With Montgomery unavailable, Capra approached James Cagney and William Powell, but Warner Bros. refused to loan them out to work on this project. Capra's first choices for Apple Annie and Henry D. Blake, Marie Dressler and W.C. Fields, could not be cast for the same reason. The director finally cast his film with an assortment of character actors under contract (mostly from Warner Bros.) to Columbia. He also went to the Downtown Los Angeles neighborhood where he had sold newspapers as a boy and hired some of the street people who congregated there as extras who would add color to the film. One week before filming began, Capra offered the role of Apple Annie to 75-year-old May Robson, most of whose career had been spent performing on stage. In later years, Capra thought the fact she and most of the supporting players were unfamiliar to movie audiences helped the public accept them as the down-on-their-luck characters they were meant to be.\nJust prior to the first preview in Hollywood in early July 1933, the film's title was changed from \"Madame La Gimp\" to \"Beggars' Holiday\", then changed again before the film premiered at Radio City Music Hall on September 7. It went into general release on September 13 and within a very short time earned $600,000, twice its budget and a substantial sum for the period. According to the contract he had negotiated prior to making the film, Capra received 10% of the net profits. The film's success prompted the making of the 1934 film \"Lady by Choice\", directed by David Burton and starring Carole Lombard. The only thing the two films have in common is Robson playing an alcoholic panhandler who has seen better days.\nIn the early 1950s, the original negative was lost while being transferred from one film lab to another for preservation work. For a period of time the only existing copy was a 35mm print owned by Capra, until he made a duplicate negative from it and donated a newly minted print to the Library of Congress. Columbia later sold the rights to the story to United Artists for $200,000, and Capra remade the film as \"Pocketful of Miracles\" with Bette Davis and Glenn Ford in 1961. The director claimed to prefer the remake to the original, although most critics and, in later years film historians and movie buffs, disagreed with his assessment.\nThe \"Apple Annie\" story transformed into Capra's \"Lady For A Day\" (and \"Pocketful of Miracles\") has long been considered a natural source for a stage musical and a number of prominent writers, including Jerry Herman, David Shire and Richard Maltby Jr; the team of John Kander and Fred Ebb have all worked on unfinished and unrealized adaptations.\nCritical reception.\nMordaunt Hall of \"The New York Times\" called it \"a merry tale with touches of sentiment, a picture which evoked laughter and tears from an audience at the first showing.\" He added, \"Its plausibility may be open to argument, but its entertainment value is not to be denied. It has aspects of Barrie's \"The Old Lady Shows Her Medals\" and also more than a mere suggestion of Shaw's \"Pygmalion\", set forth, as might be anticipated, in a more popular vein.\"\n\"Variety\" said the film \"asks the spectator to believe in the improbable. It's Hans Christian Andersen stuff written by a hard-boiled journalist and transferred to the screen by trick-wise Hollywoodites. While not stinting a full measure of credit to director Frank Capra, it seems as if the spotlight of recognition ought to play rather strongly on scriptwriter Robert Riskin.\"\nChannel 4 calls it \"wonderfully improbable and charming\" and, although \"not a bona fide Capra classic,\" it is \"cracking fun all the same.\"\nAwards and nominations.\n\"Lady for a Day\" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture but lost to \"Cavalcade\". May Robson was nominated Best Actress but lost to Katharine Hepburn in \"Morning Glory\", and Robert Riskin lost the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay to Sarah Y. Mason and Victor Heerman for \"Little Women\".\nWill Rogers presented the Academy Award for Best Director, and when he opened the envelope he simply announced, \"Come up and get it, Frank!\" Capra, certain he was the winner, ran to the podium to collect his Oscar, only to discover Rogers had meant Frank Lloyd, who won for \"Cavalcade\", instead. Possibly to downplay Capra's gaffe, Rogers then called third nominee George Cukor to join the two Franks on stage.\nHome media.\nImage Entertainment released the film on Region 1 DVD on October 23, 2001, and on Blu-ray on March 20, 2012. Both editions include commentary by Frank Capra Jr., as well as his brief introduction to the 2001 restoration work. The Blu-ray edition additionally incorporates about four and a half minutes of lost footage, including a key scene where Dave, Blake and McGuire are planning the reception.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61072", "revid": "203799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61072", "title": "Little Women", "text": "1868\u201369 novel by Louisa May Alcott\nLittle Women is a coming-of-age novel written by American novelist Louisa May Alcott, originally published in two volumes, in 1868 and 1869. The story follows the lives of the four March sisters\u2014Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy\u2014and details their passage from childhood to womanhood. Loosely based on the lives of the author and her three sisters, it is classified as an autobiographical or semi-autobiographical novel.\n\"Little Women\" was an immediate commercial and critical success, and readers were eager for more about the characters. Alcott quickly completed a second volume (titled \"Good Wives\" in the United Kingdom, though the name originated with the publisher and not Alcott). It was also met with success. The two volumes were issued in 1880 as a single novel titled \"Little Women\". Alcott subsequently wrote two sequels to her popular work, both also featuring the March sisters: \"Little Men\" (1871) and \"Jo's Boys\" (1886).\nThe novel has been said to address three major themes: \"domesticity, work, and true love, all of them interdependent and each necessary to the achievement of its heroine's individual identity.\" According to Sarah Elbert, Alcott created a new form of literature, one that took elements from romantic children's fiction and combined it with others from sentimental novels, resulting in a totally new genre. Elbert argues that within \"Little Women\" can be found the first vision of the \"All-American girl\" and that her various aspects are embodied in the differing March sisters.\nThe book has been translated into numerous languages, frequently adapted for stage and screen.\nBackground.\nIn 1868, Alcott's publisher, Thomas Niles, recommended that she write a novel about girls that would have widespread appeal. Alcott resisted, preferring to publish a collection of short stories, instead. Niles pressed her to write the girls' book first, however, and he was aided by her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, who also urged her to do so. Louisa confided to a friend, \"I could not write a girls' story knowing little about any but my sisters and always preferring boys\".\nIn May 1868, Alcott wrote in her journal: \"Niles, partner of Roberts, asked me to write a girl's book. I said I'd try.\" Alcott set her novel in an imaginary Orchard House modeled on her residence of the same name, where she wrote the novel. She, later, recalled that she did not think she could write a successful book for girls and did not enjoy writing it. \"I plod away,\" she wrote in her diary, \"although, I don't enjoy this sort of things.\"\nBy June, Alcott had sent the first dozen chapters to Niles, and both agreed that they were dull. But Niles's niece, Lillie Almy, read them and said she enjoyed them. The completed manuscript was shown to several girls who agreed it was \"splendid.\" Alcott wrote, \"they are the best critics, so, I should definitely be satisfied.\" She wrote \"Little Women\" \"in record time for money\", but the book's immediate success surprised both her and her publisher.\n\"Little Women\" was a novel that took part in the realism literary movement of the mid to late 1800s. This movement focused on depicting everyday life in a natural way and is seen through Alcott\u2019s portrayal of the real aspects of women\u2019s lives through the ways the characters interact with one another, work, and play. Gregory Eiselein and Anne Phillips write, \u201cFresh, lively, and distinctly American, the novel offered singular depictions of young women and men playing, talking, squabbling, dreaming, creating, learning, and coming of age in ways that embodied and resisted its era and region and immediately generated passionate responses.\u201d Readers are able to see and experience the joys and sorrows of the March family and come to understand what it meant to be a woman in the nineteenth century.\n One real aspect that Alcott focused on was marriage. Marriage was exceedingly prevalent in the lives of women in the nineteenth century, as during that time 93% of women in America married. However, what was special about the marriages the March women made was their equal partnerships within their relationships. Daniel Shealy writes, \u201cAlcott gave serious thought to the marriages in part two and set out to instruct her readers, especially young women, on the importance of egalitarian relationships between husbands and wives.\u201d The equal unions between man and wife can be seen through each relationship the March women have, especially between Mr. and Mrs. March\u00a0 and Meg and John Brooke, as they both share equal footing in the household and in the decisions regarding their children.\nTitle.\nAccording to literary critic Sarah Elbert, Alcott used the phrase \"little women\" to draw on its Dickensian meaning; it represented the period in a young woman's life where childhood and elder childhood are \"overlapping\" with young womanhood. Each of the March sister heroines has a harrowing experience that alerts them and the reader that \"childhood innocence\" is of the past, and that \"the inescapable woman problem\" is all that remains. \nPlot.\nMeg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, and their mother, whom they call Marmee, live in a new neighborhood (loosely based on Concord) in Massachusetts in genteel poverty. Having lost all his money, their father is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army in the American Civil War, far from home. The mother and daughters face their first Christmas without him. When Marmee asks them to give their Christmas breakfast away to an impoverished family, the girls and their mother venture to the Hummels' home, laden with baskets, to feed the hungry children, help patching up the holes, and give them firewood. When they return, they discover their wealthy, elderly neighbor, Mr. Laurence, has sent over a decadent surprise dinner, to make up for their breakfast. The two families become acquainted following these acts of kindness.\nMeg and Jo must work to support the family: Meg tutors a nearby family of four children; Jo assists her aged great-aunt March, a wealthy widow living in a mansion in Plumfield. Beth, too timid for school, is content to stay at home and help with housework; and Amy is still at school. Meg is beautiful and traditional, Jo is a tomboy who writes, Beth is a peacemaker and a pianist, and Amy is an artist who longs for elegance and fine society. The sisters strive to help their family and improve their characters, as Meg is vain, Jo is hotheaded, Beth is cripplingly shy, and Amy is materialistic. Laurie, Mr. Laurence's orphaned grandson, becomes close friends with the sisters, particularly the tomboyish Jo.\nThe girls keep busy as the war goes on. Jo writes a novel that gets published but is frustrated to have to edit it down and can't comprehend the conflicting critical response. Meg is invited to spend two weeks with rich friends, where there are parties and cotillions for the girls to dance with boys and improve their social skills. Laurie is invited to one of the dances, and Meg's friends incorrectly think she is in love with him. Meg is more interested in John Brooke, Laurie's young tutor.\nWord comes that Mr. March is ill with pneumonia and Marmee leaves to nurse him in Washington, DC. Mr. Laurence offers to accompany her, but she declines, knowing travel would be uncomfortable for the old man. Mr. Laurence, instead, sends John Brooke to do his business in Washington and help the Marches. While in Washington, Brooke confesses his love for Meg to her parents. They are pleased but consider Meg too young to marry, so Brooke agrees to wait.\nWhile Marmee is in Washington, Beth contracts scarlet fever, after spending time with a poor family, where three children die. As a precaution, Amy is sent to live with Aunt March and replaces Jo as her companion and helper. Jo, who already had scarlet fever, tends to Beth. After many days of illness, the family doctor advises the family send for Marmee. Beth recovers, but never fully regains her health and energy.\nWhile Brooke waits for Meg to come of age to marry, he joins the military and serves in the war. After being wounded, he returns to find work, so he can buy a house for when he and Meg marry. Laurie goes to college. On Christmas Day, a year after the book's opening, the girls' father returns home.\nPart Two.\nThree years later, Meg and John wed and work to adjust to married life. When they have twins, Meg is a devoted mother but John begins to feel neglected. Meg seeks advice from Marmee, who helps her find balance by making more time for wifely duties and encouraging John to become more involved with child rearing.\nLaurie graduates from college, doing well in his last year with Jo's prompting. Amy is chosen over Jo to go on a European tour with her aunt. Beth's health is weak due to complications from scarlet fever which lowers her spirits. While trying to understand Beth's sadness, Jo realizes that Laurie has fallen in love. At first she believes it is with Beth, but soon senses it is with herself. Jo confides in Marmee, telling her that she loves Laurie like a brother but does not love him in a romantic way.\nJo wants a little adventure and to put distance between herself and Laurie, hoping he will overcome his feelings. She spends six months in New York City with a friend of her mother who runs a boarding house, serving as governess for her two children. Jo takes German lessons from another boarder, Professor Friedrich Bhaer. He has come from Berlin to care for his sister's orphaned sons. For extra money, Jo anonymously writes salacious romance stories for sensational newspapers. Suspecting her secret, Friedrich comments that such writing is unprincipled and base, which persuades Jo to give up that literary genre. As Jo's time in New York ends, she is unaware that Friedrich is in love with her. When she returns to Massachusetts, Laurie proposes marriage, which she declines.\nLaurie travels to Europe with his grandfather to escape his heartbreak. At home, Beth's scarlet fever has left her permanently weakened. Jo becomes devoted to caring for her dying sister. Laurie encounters Amy in Europe and slowly falls in love with her, seeing her in a new light. She is unimpressed by his aimless, idle, and forlorn attitude since being rejected by Jo. She inspires him to find his purpose in life and do something worthwhile. News of Beth's death brings them together and a romance soon grows. Amy's aunt will not allow Amy to return home with Laurie and his grandfather unchaperoned. Amy and Laurie marry before leaving Europe.\nFriedrich, in Massachusetts on business, visits the Marches daily for two weeks. On his last day, he proposes to Jo, who realizes she loves him and they become engaged. Because Friedrich is poor, he must first establish a good income and goes west to teach. A year passes without much success. Later, Aunt March dies and leaves her large estate, Plumfield, to Jo. She marries Friedrich and turns the house into a school for boys. They have two sons, and Amy and Laurie have a daughter. At apple-picking time, Marmee celebrates her 60th birthday at Plumfield, with her husband, her three surviving daughters, their husbands, and five grandchildren.\nCharacters.\nMargaret \"Meg\" March.\nMeg, the oldest sister, is 16 when the story starts. She is described as a beauty, and she manages the household, when her mother is absent. She has long brown hair and blue eyes and particularly beautiful hands, and she is seen as the prettiest one of the sisters. Meg fulfils expectations for women of the time; from the start, she is already a nearly perfect \"little woman,\" in the eyes of the world. Before her marriage to John Brooke, while still living at home, she often lectures her younger sisters to ensure they grow to embody the title of \"little women\".\nMeg is employed as a governess for the Kings, a wealthy local family. Because of their father's family's social standing, Meg makes her debut into high society, but she is lectured by her friend and neighbor, Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, for behaving like a snob. Meg marries John Brooke, Laurie's tutor. They have twins, Margaret \"Daisy\" Brooke and John Laurence \"Demi\" Brooke. The sequel, \"Little Men,\" mentions a baby daughter, Josephine \"Josie\" Brooke, who is 14, at the beginning of the final book.\nAccording to Sarah Elbert, \"democratic domesticity requires maturity, strength, and above all, a secure identity that Meg lacks\". Others believe Alcott does not intend to belittle Meg for her ordinary life and writes her with loving detail, suffused with sentimentality.\nJosephine \"Jo\" March.\nThe principal character, Jo, 15 years old at the beginning of the book, is a strong and willful young woman, struggling to subdue her fiery temper and stubborn personality.\nSecond oldest of the four sisters, Jo is masculine, the smartest, most creative one in the family; her father has referred to her as his \"son Jo,\" and her best friend and neighbor, Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence, sometimes calls her \"my dear fellow,\" while she, alone, calls him Teddy. Jo has a \"hot\" temper that often leads her into trouble. With the help of her own misguided sense of humor, her sister, Beth, and her mother, she works on controlling it. It has been said that much of Louisa May Alcott shows through in these characteristics of Jo. In her essay, \"Recollections of My Childhood,\" Alcott refers to herself as a tomboy who enjoyed boys' activities, like running foot-races and climbing trees.\nJo loves literature, both reading and writing. She composes plays for her sisters to perform and writes short stories. She initially rejects the idea of marriage and romance, feeling that it would break up her family and separate her from the sisters whom she adores. While pursuing a literary career in New York City, she meets Friedrich Bhaer, a German professor. On her return home, Laurie proposes marriage to Jo, which she rejects, thus confirming her independence. Another reason for the rejection is that the love that Laurie has for Jo is more a brotherly love, rather than romantic love, the difference between which he was unable to understand, because he was \"just a boy,\" as said by Alcott in the book.\nAfter Beth dies, Professor Bhaer woos Jo at her home, when \"they decide to share life's burdens, just as they shared the load of bundles on their shopping expedition\". She is 25 years old when she accepts his proposal. The marriage is deferred, until her unexpected inheritance of her Aunt March's home, a year later. According to critic Barbara Sicherman, \"The crucial first point is that the choice is hers, its quirkiness another sign of her much-prized individuality.\" They have two sons, Robert \"Rob\" Bhaer and Theodore \"Ted\" Bhaer. Jo also writes the first part of \"Little Women\" during the second portion of the novel. According to Elbert, \"her narration signals a successfully completed adolescence\".\nElizabeth \"Beth\" March.\nBeth, 13 when the story starts, is described as kind, gentle, sweet, shy, quiet, honest, and musical. She is the shyest March sister and the pianist of the family. Infused with quiet wisdom, she is the peacemaker of the family, and she gently scolds her sisters, when they argue. As her sisters grow up, they begin to leave home, but Beth has no desire to leave her house or family. She is especially close to Jo: when Beth develops scarlet fever, after visiting the Hummels, Jo does most of the nursing and rarely leaves her side. Beth recovers from the acute disease, but her health is permanently weakened.\nAs she grows, Beth begins to realize that her time with her loved ones is coming to an end. Finally, the family accepts that Beth will not live much longer. They make a special room for her, filled with all the things she loves best: her kittens, her piano, Father's books, Amy's sketches, and her beloved dolls. She is never idle; she knits and sews things for the children who pass by on their way to and from school. But eventually, she puts down her sewing needle, saying it grew \"heavy.\" Beth's final sickness has a strong effect on her sisters, especially Jo, who resolves to live her life with more consideration and care for everyone. The main loss during \"Little Women\" is the death of beloved Beth. Her \"self-sacrifice is ultimately the greatest in the novel. She gives up her life, knowing that it has had only private, domestic meaning.\"\nAmy Curtis March.\nAmy is the youngest sister and baby of the family; she's 12 when the story begins. Interested in art, she is described as a \"regular snow-maiden,\" with curly golden hair and blue eyes, \"pale and slender\" and \"always carrying herself\" like a proper young lady. She is the artist of the family. Often coddled, because she is the youngest, Amy can behave in a vain and self-centered way, though she does still love her family. She has the middle name Curtis, and is the only March sister to use her full name, rather than a diminutive.\nAmy's aunt chooses her to accompany her to Europe, rather than her sister, Jo. There, she matures and makes a decision, based on her limited artistic talent, how to direct her adult life. She encounters Theodore \"Laurie\" Laurence and his grandfather during the extended visit. Amy is the least inclined of the sisters to sacrifice and self-denial. She behaves well in upper-class society and is at ease with herself. Critic Martha Saxton observes the author was never fully at ease with Amy's moral development, and her success in life seemed relatively accidental. However, Amy's morality does appear to develop throughout her adolescence and early adulthood, and she can confidently and justly put Laurie in his place when she believes he is wasting his life on pleasurable activities. Ultimately, Amy is shown to work hard to gain what she wants and make the most of her success, when she has it. She marries Laurie after Jo rejected him. They have a daughter, Elizabeth \"Bess\" Laurence, named after her late sister, Beth.\nInspiration.\nFor her books, Alcott was often inspired by familiar elements. The characters in \"Little Women\" are recognizably drawn from family members and friends. Her married sister Anna was Meg, the family beauty. Lizzie, Alcott's beloved sister, was the model for Beth. Like Beth, Lizzie was quiet and retiring. She died tragically at age twenty-three from the lingering effects of scarlet fever, as did Beth. May, Alcott's strong-willed sister, was portrayed as Amy, whose pretentious affectations cause her occasional downfalls. Alcott portrayed herself as Jo. Alcott readily corresponded with readers who addressed her as \"Miss March\" or \"Jo\", and she did not correct them.\nHowever, Alcott's portrayal, even if inspired by her family, is an idealized one. For instance, Mr. March is portrayed as a hero of the American Civil War, a gainfully employed chaplain, and, presumably, a source of inspiration to the women of the family. He is absent for most of the novel. In contrast, Bronson Alcott was very present in his family's household, due in part to his inability to find steady work. While he espoused many of the educational principles touted by the March family, he was loud and dictatorial. His lack of financial independence was a source of humiliation to his wife and daughters. The March family is portrayed as living in genteel penury, but the Alcott family, dependent on an improvident, impractical father, suffered real poverty and occasional hunger. In addition to her own childhood and that of her sisters, scholars who have examined the diaries of Louisa Alcott's mother, Abigail Alcott, have surmised that \"Little Women\" was also heavily inspired by Abigail Alcott's own early life. Originally, Alcott did not want to publish \"Little Women\", claiming she found it boring, and wasn't sure how to write girls as she knew few beyond her sisters. However, encouraged by her editor Thomas Niles, she wrote it within 10 weeks.\nAlso, \"Little Women\" has several textual and structural references to John Bunyan's novel \"The Pilgrim's Progress\". Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the book and try to follow the good example of Bunyan's Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times to \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" and liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. Several chapter titles directly reference characters and places from \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\nIn addition to drawing on her own life during the development of \"Little Women,\" Alcott also took influence from several of her earlier works including \"The Sisters' Trial\", \"A Modern Cinderella\", and \"In the Garret\". The characters within these short stories and poems, in addition to Alcott's own family and personal relationships, inspired the general concepts and bases for many of the characters in \"Little Women\".\nPublication history.\nThe first volume of \"Little Women\" was published in 1868 by Roberts Brothers. The first edition included illustrations by Abigail May Alcott, the sister commonly called \"May\" who inspired the fictional Amy March. She \"struggled\" with her illustrative additions to her sister's book, but later improved her skills and found some success as an artist.\nThe first printing of 2,000 copies sold out quickly, and the company had trouble keeping up with the demand for additional printings. They announced: \"The great literary hit of the season is undoubtedly Miss Alcott's \"Little Women\", the orders for which continue to flow in upon us to such an extent as to make it impossible to answer them with promptness.\" The last line of Chapter 23 in the first volume states: \"So the curtain falls upon Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Whether it ever rises again, depends upon the reception given the first act of the domestic drama called Little Women.\" Alcott delivered the manuscript for the second volume on New Year's Day 1869, just three months after publication of part one.\nVersions in the late 20th and 21st centuries combine both \"Little Women\" and \"Good Wives\" into one book under the title \"Little Women\", with the latter marked as Part 2 (chapters 24 to 47). Each chapter is numbered and has a title as well. Part 2, Chapter 24 opens with: \"In order that we may start afresh and go to Meg's wedding with free minds, it will be well to begin with a little gossip about the Marches.\"\nThe British influence, giving Part 2 its own title, \"Good Wives\", has the book still published in two volumes, with \"Good Wives\" beginning three years after \"Little Women\" ends, especially in the UK and Canada, but also with some US editions. Some editions listed under \"Little Women\" appear to include both parts, especially in the audiobook versions. Editions are shown in continuous print from many publishers, as hardback, paperback, audio, and e-book versions, from the 1980s onwards. \nReception.\nG. K. Chesterton believed Alcott in \"Little Women\", \"anticipated realism by twenty or thirty years\", and that Fritz's proposal to Jo, and her acceptance, \"is one of the really human things in human literature\". Gregory S. Jackson said that Alcott's use of realism belongs to the American Protestant pedagogical tradition, which includes a range of religious literary traditions with which Alcott was familiar. He has copies in his book of nineteenth-century images of devotional children's guides which provide background for the game of \"pilgrims progress\" that Alcott uses in her plot of Book One.\n\"Little Women\" was well received upon first publication. According to 21st-century critic Barbara Sicherman there was, during the 19th century, a \"scarcity of models for nontraditional womanhood\", which led more women to look toward \"literature for self-authorization. This is especially true during adolescence.\" \"Little Women\" became \"the paradigmatic text for young women of the era and one in which family literary culture is prominently featured\". Adult elements of women's fiction in \"Little Women\" included \"a change of heart necessary\" for the female protagonist to evolve in the story.\nIn the late 20th century, some scholars criticized the novel. Sarah Elbert, for instance, wrote that \"Little Women\" was the beginning of \"a decline in the radical power of women's fiction\", partly because women's fiction was being idealized with a \"hearth and home\" children's story. Women's literature historians and juvenile fiction historians have agreed that \"Little Women\" was the beginning of this \"downward spiral\". But Elbert says that \"Little Women\" did not \"belittle women's fiction\" and that Alcott stayed true to her \"Romantic birthright\".\n\"Little Women\"'s popular audience was responsive to ideas of social change as they were shown \"within the familiar construct of domesticity\". While Alcott had been commissioned to \"write a story for girls\", her primary heroine, Jo March, became a favorite of many different women, including educated women writers through the 20th century. The girl story became a \"new publishing category with a domestic focus that paralleled boys' adventure stories\".\nOne reason the novel was so popular was that it appealed to different classes of women along with those of different national backgrounds, at a time of high immigration to the United States. Through the March sisters, women could relate and dream where they may not have before. \"Both the passion \"Little Women\" has engendered in diverse readers and its ability to survive its era and transcend its genre point to a text of unusual permeability.\"\nAt the time, young girls perceived that marriage was their end goal. After the publication of the first volume, many girls wrote to Alcott asking her \"who the little women marry\". Sicherman said that the ending, which she personally characterizes as \"unsatisfying\", worked to \"keep the story alive\" as if the reader might find it ended differently upon different readings. Anne E. Boyd contends that \"Alcott particularly battled the conventional marriage plot in writing \"Little Women\"\". Alcott did not have Jo accept Laurie's hand in marriage; rather, when she arranged for Jo to marry, she portrayed an unconventional man as her husband. In Sicherman's opinion, Alcott used Friedrich to \"subvert adolescent romantic ideals\" because he was much older and seemingly unsuited for Jo. However, the character was partially based upon older men Alcott was attracted to, such as Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson, or admired, such as German writers Charles Follen and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In particular, Alcott had considered Goethe her \"chief idol\" since the day Emerson had introduced her to Goethe and handed her a copy of \"Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship\" Bhaer is also representative of Alcott's reverence for German culture.\nIn 2003 \"Little Women\" was ranked number 18 in The Big Read, a survey of the British public by the BBC to determine the \"Nation's Best-loved Novel\" (not children's novel); it is fourth-highest among novels published in the U.S. on that list. Based on a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of its \"Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children\". In 2012 it was ranked number 47 among all-time children's novels in a survey published by \"School Library Journal\", a monthly with primarily US audience.\nInfluence.\n\"Little Women\" has been one of the most widely read novels, noted by Stern from a 1927 report in \"The New York Times\" and cited in \"Little Women and the Feminist Imagination: Criticism, Controversy, Personal Essays\". Ruth MacDonald argued that \"Louisa May Alcott stands as one of the great American practitioners of the girls' novel and the family story\".\nIn the 1860s, gendered separation of children's fiction was a newer division in literature. This division signaled a beginning of polarization of gender roles as social constructs \"as class stratification increased\". Joy Kasson wrote, \"Alcott chronicled the coming of age of young girls, their struggles with issues such as selfishness and generosity, the nature of individual integrity, and, above all, the question of their place in the world around them.\" Girls related to the March sisters in \"Little Women\", along with following the lead of their heroines, by assimilating aspects of the story into their own lives.\nAfter reading \"Little Women,\" some women felt the need to \"acquire new and more public identities,\" however dependent on other factors, such as financial resources. While \"Little Women\" showed the regular lives of American middle-class girls, it also \"legitimized\" their dreams to do something different and allowed them to consider the possibilities. More young women started writing stories that had adventurous plots and \"stories of individual achievement\u2014traditionally coded male\u2014challenged women's socialization into domesticity\". \"Little Women\" also influenced contemporary European immigrants to the United States who wanted to assimilate into the middle-class culture.\nIn the pages of \"Little Women\", young and adolescent girls read the normalization of ambitious women. This provided an alternative to the previously normalized gender roles. \"Little Women\" repeatedly reinforced the importance of \"individuality\" and \"female vocation\". \"Little Women\" had \"continued relevance of its subject\" and \"its longevity points, as well to surprising continuities in gender norms from the 1860s at least through the 1960s\". Those interested in domestic reform could look to the pages of \"Little Women\" to see how a \"democratic household\" would operate.\nWhile \"Alcott never questioned the value of domesticity,\" she challenged the social constructs that made spinsters obscure and fringe members of society, solely because they were not married. \"\"Little Women\" indisputably enlarges the myth of American womanhood, by insisting that the home and the women's sphere cherish individuality and thus produce young adults who can make their way in the world, while preserving a critical distance from its social arrangements.\" As with all youth, the March girls had to grow up. These sisters, and in particular, Jo, were apprehensive about adulthood, because they were afraid that, by conforming to what society wanted, they would lose their special individuality.\nAlcott's Jo also made professional writing imaginable for generations of women. Writers as diverse as Maxine Hong Kingston, Margaret Atwood, and J. K. Rowling have noted the influence of Jo March on their artistic development. Even other fictional portraits of young women aspiring to authorship often reference Jo March.\nAlcott's novel is often celebrated for Jo and her narrative arc in which she becomes a self-determined woman with a career. However, framing this novel as a success, solely for Jo's accomplishments, portrays it as a \"traditional 'lone genius' patriarchal narrative\" in which only women who are \"categorized as 'exceptional' or particularly 'worthy'\" are celebrated. \"Little Women\" awards all its women worthy, despite their status as conventional or unconventional\u2014not just Jo, who is the obvious exception to societal expectation. Alcott's novel celebrates the agency of women, the four sisters and their mother, to choose their path in life. Meg makes the decision to marry and have children and though it is the traditional pathway, she makes the choice for her own happiness. Thus, reducing Alcott's novel to just Jo's experience as an exception promotes it as a patriarchal narrative and erases her careful work to portray a matriarchal narrative, rich with female agency and voice.\nAlcott \"made women's rights integral to her stories, and above all, to \"Little Women\"\". Alcott's fiction became her \"most important feminist contribution\"\u2014even considering all the effort Alcott made to help facilitate women's rights\". She thought that \"a democratic household could evolve into a feminist society.\" In \"Little Women\", she imagined that just such an evolution might begin with Plumfield, a nineteenth-century feminist utopia.\n\"Little Women\" has a timeless resonance which reflects Alcott's grasp of her historical framework in the 1860s. The novel's ideas do not intrude themselves upon the reader because the author is wholly in control of the implications of her imaginative structure. Sexual equality is the salvation of marriage and the family; democratic relationships make happy endings. This is the unifying imaginative frame of \"Little Women\".\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\n\"Little Women\" has been adapted to film seven times.

It was written by Lajos B\u00edr\u00f3 and Arthur Wimperis for London Film Productions, Korda's production company. The film, which focuses on the marriages of King Henry VIII of England, was a major international success, establishing Korda as a leading filmmaker and Laughton as a box-office star.\nPlot summary.\nThe film begins 20 years into King Henry VIII's reign and covers the last 11 years of his marital life in a series of comedic vignettes. In May 1536, in the immediate aftermath of the execution of his second wife Anne Boleyn, Henry marries Jane Seymour, who dies in childbirth 18 months later. He then weds a German princess, Anne of Cleves. This marriage ends in divorce after Anne deliberately makes herself unattractive so that she may be free to marry her sweetheart. Henry next marries the beautiful and ambitious Lady Katherine Howard. She has rejected love all of her life in favour of ambition, but after her marriage, she falls in love with Henry's handsome courtier Thomas Culpeper, who had attempted to woo her in the past. Their liaison is discovered by Henry's court and the two are executed. The weak and aging Henry consoles himself with a final marriage to Catherine Parr, who proves domineering. In the final scene, while Parr is no longer in the room, the king breaks the fourth wall, saying \"Six wives, and the best of them's the worst.\"\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Charles Laughton as Henry VIII\nProduction.\nAlexander Korda was seeking a film project suitable for Charles Laughton and his wife Elsa Lanchester. Originally, the story was to focus solely on the marriage of King Henry VIII and his fourth wife Anne of Cleves, but as the project grew, the story was modified to focus on five of Henry's six wives. Only the first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was omitted because those involved had no particular interest in her, describing her as a \"respectable woman\" in the film's first intertitles. Korda chose to ignore the religious and political aspects of Henry's reign, as the film makes no mention of the break with Rome and instead focuses on Henry's relations with his wives.\nThe film cost \u00a393,710 which was five times the average cost of a British feature in the early 1930s.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" was a commercial success. It made Alexander Korda a premier figure in the film industry, and United Artists signed him for 16 films. It also advanced the careers of Charles Laughton, Robert Donat and Merle Oberon (in her third major film). Laughton would later reprise the same role in the 1953 film \"Young Bess\" opposite Jean Simmons as his daughter Elizabeth.\nThe film earned receipts of \u00a381,825 in the UK, which was not enough to recover its production costs. However it was hugely successful overseas, being the 12th-most-successful of 1933 at the American box office and ultimately earned rentals of \u00a3500,000 on its first release.\nIt premiered to record-breaking crowds at New York's Radio City Music Hall and London's Leicester Square Theatre (now the Odeon West End), where it ran for nine weeks from 27 October 1933.\nAwards.\nAt the Academy Awards, the film was the first foreign picture to win an Oscar (Charles Laughton for Best Actor), and the first foreign Best Picture nominee.\nLaughton was voted best actor in a British film by readers of \"Film Weekly\".\nHistoricity.\nAccuracy.\n\"The Private Life of Henry VIII\" is credited with creating the popular image of Henry VIII as a fat, lecherous glutton who eats turkey legs and tosses bones over his shoulder (although in the film, what Henry eats is actually an entire capon). Historian Alison Weir has pointed out that this image is contradicted by primary sources, noting: \"As a rule, Henry did not dine in the great halls of his palaces, and his table manners were highly refined, as was the code of etiquette followed at his court. He was in fact a most fastidious man, and\u2014for his time\u2014unusually obsessed with hygiene. As for his pursuit of the ladies, there is plenty of evidence, but most of it fragmentary, for Henry was also far more discreet and prudish than we have been led to believe. These are just superficial examples of how the truth about historical figures can become distorted.\"\nCatherine of Aragon is excluded from the script because she was a \"respectable woman,\" in the words of the introductory titles, but the exclusion may have occurred because the real-life Catherine stubbornly refused to allow Henry to marry Anne Boleyn, a fact that might have weakened the audience's identification with the king. The film also does not mention that Boleyn was convicted of false charges of incest with her brother, who was also executed, a fact that might have pitted the audience against Henry. The film inaccurately depicts Henry marrying Jane Seymour on the same day as Boleyn was beheaded (19 May 1536); in fact, Henry only obtained permission to remarry that day, marrying Seymour on 30 May 1536. The film's portrayal of Seymour as a vain, stupid, childlike woman contradicts some accounts that the real Seymour was an intelligent woman.\nAnne of Cleves is inaccurately shown in love with another man before she marries Henry, and this is presented as her reason for wanting to end the marriage. The relationship is played for comic effect, but the real process of ending the marriage lasted several weeks rather than over the course of a single night as portrayed in the film. Anne's desire to remain in England is attributed to her love for Peynell in the film, but in reality, her motivation may have been to escape the tyrannical supervision of her stern brother, William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg.\nAccording to historical accounts, Catherine Howard was an immature teenager of limited intelligence who did not realize the grave risk involved with her adultery. However, the film portrays Howard as a mature, intelligent woman who knew the risks of adultery, an inaccuracy that may have been intended to elicit audience sympathy for Henry's decision to have her executed.\nCatherine Parr may also have been inaccurately portrayed; rather than a nagging tyrant, the real Parr was an intellectual with a strong interest in theology and a gentle demeanour who engaged Henry in intellectual discussions about religion in his final years.\nContemporary echoes.\nHistorian Greg Walker has noted that Korda integrated references to contemporary political issues, as the film anachronistically refers to the Holy Roman Empire as Germany and portrays the empire as more united than it really was at the time. The frequent wars between Holy Roman Emperor Charles V against King Francis I of France are depicted as examples of French\u2013German enmity, with Henry attempting to act as peacemaker. The film inaccurately portrays the French fighting Germans in the Habsburg-Valois wars rather than the Spanish.\nIn the interwar period, the Treaty of Versailles was widely considered in Britain to be excessively harsh toward Germany, and successive British governments attempted to promote revision of the Versailles treaty in Germany's favour while also guarding against a resurgence of German militarism. The Locarno Treaties of 1925 were an attempt to improve Franco-German relations, and evidence suggests that this policy was very popular with the British people. Henry's monologue warning that the French and Germans will destroy Europe because of their mutual hatred and declaring that it is his duty to save the peace may have been understood by a 1933 British audience as an allegory for the current British policy of leniency toward Germany.\nThe film possibly refers to the 1932 World Disarmament Conference and the current debate about rearmament when Henry is warned by Thomas Cromwell that spending on the navy will \"cost us much money,\" to which he retorts that not to spend money on the navy will \"cost us England.\" Korda disliked the Labour Party's call for disarmament, and Henry's message in the film may have been a rebuke to those who called for Britain to continue with disarmament and to those in the government who were cutting military spending in light of the Great Depression.\nIn the 1920s and '30s, many in Britain bristled at Hollywood's domination of the film industry; by 1925, only 5% of the films shown in Britain were British. In 1932, Sir Stephen Tallents called for \"The Projection of England\", warning that if the British film industry failed to tell its own stories that would define Britain, then Hollywood would do so. This sparked interest in the Tudor era and an image of the period as a prosperous, happy time untroubled by class divisions and economic depressions. The character of John Bull was portrayed as uncultured but kind, boisterous and exuberant, all qualities perceived as typically British. His lack of sophistication hid a mind that was shrewd and cunning, also a reflection of British self-image at the time. Korda, a Hungarian immigrant who craved acceptance in Britain, may have ascribed much of John Bull's imagery and traits to Henry VIII in the film.\nCopyright status.\nAs a result of overlapping changes in British copyright law, the film never fell into the public domain in the UK and its copyright is now due to expire at the end of 2026, 70 years after Alexander Korda's death. In countries that observe a 50-year term, such as Canada and Australia, the copyright expired at the end of 2006.\nIn the United States, the film's original 1933 copyright registration was not renewed after the initial 28-year term, and the film thus fell into the public domain there. As a foreign film still in copyright in its country of origin, its American copyright was automatically restored in 1996 with a term of 95 years from release, meaning that the copyright will expire at the end of 2028.\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "61075", "revid": "31192532", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=61075", "title": "Thrasybulus", "text": "Athenian general and politician (c. 440 \u2013 388 BC)\nThrasybulus (; ; c. 440 \u2013 388 BC) was a Greek general and democratic leader. In 411 BC, in the wake of an oligarchic coup at Athens, the pro-democracy sailors at Samos elected him as a general, making him a primary leader of the ultimately successful democratic resistance to the coup. As general, he was responsible for recalling the controversial nobleman Alcibiades from exile, and the two worked together extensively over the next several years. In 411 and 410, Thrasybulus was in command along with Alcibiades and others at several critical Athenian naval victories.\nAfter Athens's defeat in the Peloponnesian War, Thrasybulus led the democratic resistance to the new oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, imposed by the victorious Spartans upon Athens. In 404 BC, he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded the Spartan-ruled Attica and, in successive battles, first defeated a Spartan garrison and then the forces of the oligarchy. In the wake of these victories, democracy was re-established at Athens. As a leader of this revived democracy in the 4th century BC, Thrasybulus advocated a policy of resistance to Sparta and sought to restore Athens's imperial power. He was killed in 388 BC while leading an Athenian naval force during the Corinthian War.\nPersonal life and early career.\nAlmost nothing is known of Thrasybulus's background or early life. His father was named Lycus, and he was a native of the deme of Steiria in Athens. He was probably born between 455 and 441 BC, although dates as late as the later 430s BC have been suggested. He was married, and had two children. Several facts make it clear that he was from a wealthy family; he held the office of trierarch, which involved significant personal expenditures on several occasions, and in the 4th century BC his son was able to pay a substantial fine of 10 talents.\nBy 411 Thrasybulus had established a reputation as a pro-democracy politician. Throughout his career, Thrasybulus consistently advocated several policies. He was a proponent of Athenian imperialism and expansionism and a strong supporter of Periclean democracy. According to Demosthenes, Thrasybulus was one of the \"great and distinguished orators.\" Plutarch notes that he had \"the loudest voice of the Athenians.\" And the Athenian general Conon described Thrasybulus as a man who was \"bold in counsel.\" During his period of prominence within the democracy, he seems to have led what might now be termed a populist faction.\nAccording to the historical account provided by Xenophon, he was murdered by locals during the night while acting as general of a military expedition on its way to Rhodes while on a stopover in Aspendus on the Eurymedon River on account of his soldiers' recent transgressions against local farmers and their farmsteads.\nCoup of 411 BC.\nIn 413 BC, a massive Athenian expedition force was obliterated in Sicily. In the wake of this defeat, Athens found itself facing a crisis of unprecedented magnitude. Cities throughout its Aegean empire began to rebel, and a Peloponnesian fleet sailed to assist them. Seeking to contain the crisis, Athens tapped its reserve fund to rebuild its fleet and dispatched what ships it had to establish an advance naval base at Samos.\nIn this general atmosphere of crisis, aristocrats at Athens who had long desired to overthrow the democracy there began to agitate publicly for a change of government, and formed a conspiracy to bring an oligarchy to power in Athens. Their plans included recalling Alcibiades, who had been exiled by the democratic government. These oligarchs initiated their plans at Samos, where they successfully encouraged a number of Samian oligarchs to begin a similar conspiracy.\nA dispute has arisen among modern historians over Thrasybulus's involvement in this plot. Donald Kagan has suggested that Thrasybulus was one of the founding members of the scheme and was willing to support moderate oligarchy, but was alienated by the extreme actions taken by the plotters. R. J. Buck, on the other hand, maintains that Thrasybulus was probably never involved in the plot, possibly because he was absent from Samos at the time of its inception.\nUpon their return to Athens, the conspirators succeeded in ending democratic rule and imposing an oligarchy of 400 rulers. At Samos, however, the coup did not go forward as smoothly. Samian democrats learned of the conspiracy and notified four prominent Athenians, the generals Leon and Diomedon, Thrasybulus, and Thrasyllus, at that time a hoplite in the ranks. With the support of these men and the Athenian soldiers and sailors in general, the Samian democrats were able to defeat the conspirators when they attempted to seize power.\nA ship was dispatched to Athens to notify the city of this success against the oligarchs. Upon its arrival, however, the crew was arrested, as the news of a democratic victory was far from welcome to the new oligarchic government. Learning of this, the army at Samos deposed its generals and elected new generals who were believed to be more steadfast in their support of democracy, Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus among them. The army, stating that they had not revolted from the city but that the city had revolted from them, resolved to stand by the democracy while continuing to prosecute the war against Sparta.\nOne of the first actions Thrasybulus took as general was to bring about the recall of Alcibiades, a policy that he had supported since before the coup. After persuading the sailors to support his plan, Thrasybulus sailed to retrieve Alcibiades and returned with him to Samos. The aim of this policy was to win away Persian support from the Spartans, as it was believed that Alcibiades had great influence with Tissaphernes. Alcibiades was elected as general alongside Thrasybulus and the others. Shortly after this, following the revolt of Euboea, the government of the 400 at Athens was overthrown and replaced by a broader oligarchy, which would eventually give way to democracy.\nIn command.\nIn the months following these events, Thrasybulus commanded the Athenian fleet in several major engagements. At the Battle of Cynossema, he commanded the right wing of the fleet and prevented Athenian defeat by extending his flank to prevent encirclement; the battle ended in Athenian victory. Shortly afterwards Thrasybulus again commanded a wing of the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Abydos, another Athenian victory.\nThrasybulus was again in command of a squadron of the Athenian fleet at the Battle of Cyzicus, a stunning Athenian victory. In this battle, the Athenians drew the Spartan fleet out to pursue a small force led by Alcibiades; when the Spartans had gotten a good distance from land, two squadrons under the command of Thrasybulus and Theramenes appeared in their rear to cut off their retreat. The Spartans were forced to flee to a nearby beach, where Alcibiades landed his men in an attempt to seize the Spartan ships. The Spartans, however, with the assistance of a Persian army, began to drive this Athenian force into the sea; seeing this, Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered Theramenes to join up with Athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach. The Spartans and Persians, overwhelmed by the arrival of multiple forces from several directions, were defeated and driven off, and the Athenians captured all the Spartan ships which were not destroyed.\nIn 409 and 408, Thrasybulus remained in command, but his actions are difficult to trace. He appears to have spent much of the time campaigning in Thrace, recapturing cities for the empire and restoring the flow of tribute from the region. In 407 BC, he was in command of a fleet sent to besiege Phocaea; this siege had to be lifted, however, after the Spartans under Lysander defeated the main Athenian fleet at Notium. This defeat led to the downfall and exile of Alcibiades. Thrasybulus was either removed from command on the spot by Alcibiades or not reelected at the end of his term; either way, he was out of office from then until the end of the war.\nThrasybulus did return to action, however, at the Battle of Arginusae in 406 BC. There, he was a trierarch in the Athenian relief fleet sent out to assist the admiral Conon, who was blockaded at Mytilene. That battle was a major Athenian victory; after the battle, the generals in charge took the majority of their ships to attack the Peloponnesian fleet blockading Conon, leaving behind a force under Thrasybulus and his fellow trierarch Theramenes to rescue the survivors. This operation was thwarted, however, by a sudden storm which drove the rescue force to land, and a great number of Athenians\u2014estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000\u2014drowned. The result was one of the great Athenian political scandals of the war, which culminated in a vicious debate between Theramenes and the generals at Athens over who was to blame for the disaster, after which the generals were executed. Thrasybulus, for unknown reasons, seems to have had very little involvement in this debate.\nThe Thirty Tyrants.\nIn 404 BC, following a defeat at the Battle of Aegospotami, Athens was forced to surrender, ending the Peloponnesian War. In the wake of this surrender, the Spartan navarch Lysander imposed a strict oligarchic government on Athens, which came to be known as the Thirty Tyrants. This government executed a number of citizens and deprived all but a few of their rights, eventually growing so extreme that even the moderate oligarch Theramenes fell afoul of the government and was executed. Fearing for their lives, numerous Athenians fled to Thebes.\nThrasybulus had been one of the first to oppose the oligarchy and had been exiled to Thebes shortly after its rise to power. There, he was welcomed and supported by the Theban leader Ismenias and his followers, who assisted him in preparing for a return to Athens. In 403 BC, he led a party of 70 exiles to seize Phyle, a defensible location on the border of Attica and Boeotia. A storm prevented the forces of the Thirty from expelling him immediately, and numerous exiles flocked to join him. When the Spartan garrison of Athens, supported by Athenian cavalry, was sent out to oppose him, Thrasybulus led his force, now 700 strong, in a surprise daybreak raid on their camp, killing 120 Spartans and putting the rest to flight.\nFive days later, Thrasybulus led his force, which had already grown to the point that he could leave 200 men at Phyle while taking 1,000 with him, to Piraeus, the port of Athens. There, he fortified the Munychia, a hill that dominated the port, and awaited the coming attack. The forces of the Thirty, supported by the Spartan garrison, marched to Piraeus to attack him. Thrasybulus and his men were outnumbered 5 to 1, but held a superior position and presumably benefited from consternation amidst the ranks of the oligarchs. In the battle, the exiles put the oligarchic forces to flight, killing Critias, the leader of the Thirty.\nAfter this victory, the remainder of the Thirty fled to Eleusis, and the oligarchs within Athens began squabbling amongst themselves. New leaders were selected, but were unable to deal with Thrasybulus, and were forced to send to Sparta for help. The Spartans, however, did not send the aggressive Lysander, but the more conservative Pausanias. Pausanias's force narrowly defeated Thrasybulus's men, but only with great effort, and, unwilling to push the issue, he arranged a settlement between the forces of Thrasybulus and the oligarchs in the city. Democracy was restored, while those oligarchs who wished to do so withdrew to Eleusis. In power, Thrasybulus pushed through a law which pardoned all but a few of the oligarchs, preventing a brutal reprisal by the victorious democrats. For his actions, Thrasybulus was awarded an olive crown by his countrymen.\nLater actions.\nIn the revived democracy established in 403 BC, Thrasybulus became a major and prestigious leader, although he was soon superseded at the head of the state by Archinus. Thrasybulus seems to have advocated a more radically democratic policy than the populace was willing to accept at the time; he called for reinstating pay for political service, and sought to extend citizenship to all the metics and foreigners who had fought alongside him against the Thirty. He was initially cautious about offending Sparta, but, when Persian support became available at the start of the Corinthian War, he became an advocate of aggressive action, and about this time seems to have regained his preeminence in Athenian politics. He initiated the rebuilding of the Long Walls, which had been demolished at the end of the Peloponnesian War, and commanded the Athenian contingents at Nemea and Coronea; these two defeats, however, damaged his political stature, and he was replaced at the head of the state by Conon, whose victory at Cnidus had ended Sparta's dreams of naval empire.\nThrasybulus largely faded from view for several years as Conon led the Athenian fleet to a series of victories, but in 392 BC Conon was imprisoned by the Persian satrap Tiribazus while attending a peace conference at Sardis; although released, he died in Cyprus without returning to Athens. Thrasybulus, leading the faction that sought to reject the peace offer, regained his position atop Athenian politics. In 389 BC, he led a force of triremes to levy tribute from cities around the Aegean and support Rhodes, where a democratic government was struggling against Sparta. On this campaign, Thrasybulus relaid much of the framework for an Athenian empire on 5th century BC model; he captured Byzantium, imposed a duty on ships passing through the Hellespont, and collected tribute from many of the islands of the Aegean. In 388 BC, as he led his fleet South through the Aegean, his soldiers ravaged the fields of Aspendus. In retaliation, the Aspendians raided the Athenian camp by night; Thrasybulus was killed in his tent.\nThe gains that Thrasybulus made on this campaign were soon reversed, however, by Persian intervention. Alarmed by the sudden reappearance of something resembling the Athenian empire that had driven them from the Aegean in the 5th century BC, the Persians began supporting Sparta, and a Persian fleet was soon in the Hellespont, threatening Athens's grain supply. Peace was quickly concluded, on the same terms that the Athenians had rejected in 392 BC; Thrasybulus's campaigns, though impressively successful in spreading Athenian influence, had little long-term effect, since they prompted Persia to force the Athenians to give up what they had gained.\nHistorical opinions.\nThrasybulus has been widely recognized as a successful military commander. Most of the major ancient historians assigned credit for the dramatic Athenian victories of 411 BC to Alcibiades, but a few, such as Cornelius Nepos, pointed to the decisive role that was played in these battles by Thrasybulus. More recent historians, such as Donald Kagan and R. J. Buck, have tended to support this analysis, pointing to the role that Thrasybulus played in crafting Athenian strategy in all these battles, and specifically to the decisive action he took at Cyzicus, which saved Alcibiades's force from being swamped, and turned a potential Athenian defeat into a stunning victory. R. J. Buck has suggested that Thrasybulus suffered from an \"anti-democratic tradition of ancient historiography,\" which led many writers to minimize the accomplishments of one of democracy's strongest advocates.\nThroughout his career, Thrasybulus defended democracy at Athens against its opponents. He was one of the few prominent citizens whom the Samians trusted to defend their democracy, and whom the fleet selected to lead it through the troubled time of conflict with the 400. Later, in his opposition to the Thirty Tyrants, Thrasybulus risked his life when few others would, and his actions were responsible for the quick restoration of democracy. In the words of Cornelius Nepos,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;This most noble action, then, is entirely Thrasybulus's; for when the Thirty Tyrants, appointed by the Lacedaemonians, kept Athens oppressed in a state of slavery, and had partly banished from their country, and partly put to death, a great number of the citizens whom fortune had spared in the war, and had divided their confiscated property among themselves, he was not only the first, but the only man at the commencement, to declare war against them.\nJohn Fine points to the clemency shown by Thrasybulus and other democrats in the wake of their victory over the Thirty as a key contribution towards reestablishing stable government in Athens. While many city-states throughout the Greek world broke down into vicious cycles of civil war and reprisal, Athens remained united and democratic, without interruption, until near the end of the 3rd century BC, and democracy, albeit interrupted several times by conquest or revolution, continued there until Roman times, several centuries later.\nThe second-century travel writer Pausanias called Thrasybulus \"the greatest of all famous Athenians\" for overthrowing the Thirty as well as his other exploits, making clear that he thought him greater than even Pericles.\nThus Thrasybulus won praise as an Athenian patriot and staunch, principled democrat. He has been criticized by modern historians, however, for failing to recognize that Athens in the 4th century BC could not sustain an imperial policy. R. J. Buck suggests that Thrasybulus, who came of age in the heady days when the democracy and empire under Pericles were at their fullest extent, never accepted that the devastating losses Athens had suffered in the Peloponnesian War made the return of those times impossible.\nBuck compared him to Winston Churchill, another advocate of imperial policies who held fast to his beliefs after the tide of history had turned against him, and who rose to his peak of prominence at his country's darkest hour.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Moonyean visits John as a ghost. The roles of Kathleen and Moonyean were both played by Jane Cowl.\nThe popular story was first filmed in 1922 by First National Pictures, and was later remade twice by MGM, in 1932 and 1941.

Seale is widely known for co-founding the Marxist\u2013Leninist and black power political organization the Black Panther Party (BPP) with fellow activist Huey P. Newton. Founded as the \"Black Panther Party for Self-Defense\", the Party's main practice was monitoring police activities and challenging police brutality in black communities, first in Oakland, California, and later in cities throughout the United States.\nSeale was one of the eight people charged by the US federal government with conspiracy charges related to anti-Vietnam War protests in Chicago, Illinois, during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Seale's appearance in the trial was widely publicized and Seale was bound and gagged for his appearances in court more than a month into the trial for what Judge Julius Hoffman said were disruptions.\nSeale's case was severed from the other defendants, turning the \"Chicago Eight\" into the \"Chicago Seven\". After his case was severed, the government declined to retry him on the conspiracy charges. Though he was never convicted in the case, Seale was sentenced by Judge Hoffman to four years for criminal contempt of court. The contempt sentence was reversed on appeal.\nIn 1970, while in prison, Seale was charged and tried as part of the New Haven Black Panther trials over the torture and murder of Alex Rackley, whom the Black Panther Party had suspected of being a police informer. Panther George Sams, Jr., testified that Seale had ordered him to kill Rackley. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in Seale's trial, and the charges were eventually dropped.\nSeale's books include \"A Lonely Rage: The Autobiography of Bobby Seale\", \"Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton\", and \"Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers\", with Stephen Shames.\nEarly life.\nBobby Seale was born in Dallas, Texas, to George Seale, a carpenter, and Thelma Seale (n\u00e9e Traylor), a homemaker. The Seale family lived in poverty during most of his early life. After moving around Texas, first to Dallas, then to San Antonio, and Port Arthur, Seale's family relocated to Codornices Village in Berkeley, California, during the Great Migration when he was eight years old. \nSeale attended Berkeley High School. He dropped out in 1955 and joined the United States Air Force. Three years later, a court martial convicted him of fighting with a commanding officer at Ellsworth Air Force Base in South Dakota, resulting in a bad conduct discharge.\nSeale subsequently worked as a sheet metal mechanic for aerospace plants while studying for his high school diploma at night. \"I worked in every major aircraft plant and aircraft corporation, even those with government contracts. I was a top-flight sheet-metal mechanic\". After earning his high school diploma, Seale attended Merritt Community College where he studied engineering and politics until 1962.\nWhile at college, Bobby Seale joined the Afro-American Association (AAA), a group on the campus devoted to self-education about African and African-American history, along with conversations about philosophy, religion, economics, and politics, including aspects of black separatism. \"I wanted to be an engineer when I went to college, but I got shifted right away since I became interested in American Black History and trying to solve some of the problems.\" Through the AAA group, Seale met Huey P. Newton.\nIn June 1966, Seale began working at the North Oakland Neighborhood Anti-Poverty Center in its summer youth program. Seale's objective was to teach the youth in the program Black American History and encourage their responsibility toward the people in their communities. While working in the program, Seale met Bobby Hutton, who later became the first recruited member of the Black Panther Party.\nSeale married Artie McMillan. They had a son, Malik Nkrumah Stagolee Seale.\nActivism and leadership.\nBlack Panthers.\nBobby Seale and Huey P. Newton were strongly inspired by the teachings of activist Malcolm X, who was assassinated in 1965. In October 1966, the two joined together to create the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, which adopted the late activist's slogan \"freedom by any means necessary\" as their own. Prior to starting the Black Panther Party, Seale and Newton created a group known as the Soul Students Advisory Council. The group was organized to operate through \"ultra-democracy\", defined as individualism manifesting itself as an aversion to discipline. \"The goal was to develop a college campus group that would help develop leadership; to go back to the black community and serve the black community in a revolutionary fashion\".\nAfter the inception of Soul Students Advisory Council, Seale and Newton founded the group they are most identified with, the Black Panther Party. They wanted to organize the black community to express their desires and needs in order to resist the racism and classism perpetuated by the system. Seale described the Panthers as \"an organization that represents black people and many white radicals relate to this and understand that the Black Panther Party is a righteous revolutionary front against this racist decadent, capitalistic system.\"\nAccording to Seale, in 1967 he and Newton obtained copies of \"Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong\" from the Chinese Book Store in San Francisco to sell at University of California, Berkeley.245 With the proceeds, they purchased weapons to arm Black Panther Party members for self-defense against police brutality.245\nWriting.\nSeale and Newton together wrote the doctrines \"What We Want Now!\", which Seale said were intended to be \"the practical, specific things we need and that should exist\", and \"What We Believe\", which outlines the philosophical principles of the Black Panther Party in order to educate the people and disseminate information about the specifics of the party's platform. These writings were part of the party's Ten-Point Program. Also known as \"The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense Ten-Point Platform and Program\", this was a set of guidelines to the Black Panther Party's ideals and ways of operation. Seale and Newton named Newton as Minister of Defense and Seale as the Chairman of the party. During his time with the Panthers, Seale was kept under surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as part of its illegal COINTELPRO program.\nIn 1968, Seale wrote \"Seize the Time: The Story of the Black Panther Party and Huey P. Newton\" (1970).\nThe Trial of the Chicago 8.\nBobby Seale was one of the original \"Chicago Eight\" defendants charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot in the wake of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. While in prison, Seale said, \"To be a Revolutionary is to be an Enemy of the state. To be arrested for this struggle is to be a Political Prisoner.\" The evidence against Seale was slim, as he did not participate in activist planning for the convention's protests and had gone to Chicago as a last-minute replacement for activist Eldridge Cleaver. He was in Chicago for only two days of the convention.\nDuring the trial, Judge Julius Hoffman ordered Seale bound and gagged in the courtroom because of his outspoken objections to his personal lack of legal representation, Seale's attorney being hospitalized at the time. He was repeatedly bound and gagged for several days of the trial.\nThough he was never convicted in the case, on November 5, 1969, Judge Hoffman sentenced Seale to four years in prison for 16 counts of contempt, each count for three months of imprisonment, because of his outbursts during the trial. He eventually ordered Seale severed from the case. Proceedings against the remaining defendants resulted in their being renamed the \"Chicago Seven\".\nNew Haven Black Panther trials.\nWhile serving his four-year sentence, Seale was tried in 1970 as part of the New Haven Black Panther trials. Several officers of the Panther organization had killed fellow Panther, Alex Rackley, who had confessed under torture to being a police informant. The leader of the murder plan, George W. Sams Jr., turned state's evidence and testified that Seale, who had visited New Haven hours before the murder, had ordered him to kill Rackley.\nThe trials were accompanied by a large demonstration in New Haven on May Day, 1970. This coincided with the beginning of the American college student strike of 1970. The jury was unable to reach a verdict in Seale's trial, and the charges were eventually dropped. The government suspended his contempt convictions, and Seale was released from prison in 1972.\nWhile Seale was in prison, his wife, Artie, became pregnant. Fellow Panther Fred Bennett was said to be the father. Bennett's mutilated remains were found in a suspected Panther hideout in April 1971. Seale was implicated in the murder, with police suspecting he had ordered it in retaliation for the affair, but no charges were pressed.\n1973 and 1974 activities.\nIn 1973, Seale ran for Mayor of Oakland, California as a Democrat. In an election with an unusually high 65% voter turnout, he came in second in a field of nine candidates with 20% of the vote to the incumbent Mayor John Reading's 50%. Although Seale came in well behind Reading, the incumbent fell short of a majority, forcing a runoff election which Reading ultimately won.\nIn 1974, Seale and Huey Newton argued over a proposed film about the Panthers that Newton wanted Bert Schneider to produce. According to several accounts, the argument escalated to a fight in which Newton, backed by his armed bodyguards, allegedly beat Seale with a bullwhip so badly that Seale required extensive medical treatment for his injuries. Afterward, he went into hiding for nearly a year, and ended his affiliation with the Party that year. Seale has denied that any such physical altercation took place, dismissing rumors that he and Newton were ever less than friends.\nThe Ten Point Platform.\nSeale worked with Huey Newton to create the Ten Point platform. It included political and social demands they believed necessary for the survival of the Black population in the United States. The two men formulated the Ten Point Platform in the late 1960s, and from these ideologies developed the Black Panther Party. The document encapsulated the economic exploitation of the black body, and addressed the mistreatment of the black race. This document was attractive to those suffering under the oppressive nature of white power. \nThe document is based on the conclusion that a combination of racism and capitalism resulted in fascism in the United States. The Ten Point Platform lays out the need for full employment of Black people, decent shelter, and decent education. They defined decent education as the full history of the United States, including acknowledgement of the genocide and displacement of Native Americans and the enslavement of Africans. The platform calls for the release of political prisoners.\nThe points are as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;#We Want Freedom. We Want Power To Determine The Destiny Of Our Black Community.\nOther work.\nIn 1978, Seale wrote an autobiography titled \"A Lonely Rage\". In 1987, he wrote a cookbook called \"Barbeque'n with Bobby Seale: Hickory &amp; Mesquite Recipes\", the proceeds going to non-profit social organizations. Seale also advertised Ben &amp; Jerry's ice cream.\nIn 1998, Seale appeared on the television documentary series \"Cold War\", discussing the events of the 1960s. Bobby Seale was the central protagonist alongside Kathleen Cleaver, Jamal Joseph and Nile Rodgers in the 1999 theatrical documentary \"Public Enemy\" by Jens Meurer, which premiered at the Venice Film Festival.\nIn 2002, Seale began dedicating his time to Reach!, a group focused on youth education programs. He has also taught black studies at Temple University in Philadelphia. Also in 2002, Seale moved back to Oakland, working with young political advocates to influence social change. \nIn 2006, he appeared in the documentary \"The U.S. vs. John Lennon\" to discuss his friendship with John Lennon. Seale has visited over 500 colleges to share his personal experiences as a Black Panther and to give advice to students interested in community organizing and social justice.\nSince 2013, Seale has been seeking to produce a screenplay he wrote based on his autobiography, \"Seize the Time: The Eighth Defendant\".\nSeale co-authored \"Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers\", a 2016 book with photographer Stephen Shames.\nIn 2025, https://.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term was originated by Angus MacPhail for film, adopted by Alfred Hitchcock, and later extended to a similar device in other fiction.\nThe MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially thrillers. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first act, and thereafter declines in importance. It can reappear at the climax of the story but may actually be forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes derisively identified as plot coupons\u2014the characters \"collect\" the coupons to trade in for an ending.\nHistory and use.\nThe use of a MacGuffin as a plot device predates the name MacGuffin. The Holy Grail of Arthurian legend has been cited as an early example of a MacGuffin. The Holy Grail is the desired object that is essential to initiate and advance the plot, but the final disposition of the Grail is never revealed, suggesting that the object is not of significance in itself. An even earlier example would be the Golden Fleece of Greek mythology, in the quest of Jason and the Argonauts; \"the Fleece itself, the of this entire epic geste, remains a complete [...] mystery. The full reason for its Grail-like desirability [...] is never explained.\"\nThe World War I\u2013era actress Pearl White used the term \"weenie\" to identify whatever object (a roll of film, a rare coin, expensive diamonds, etc.) impelled the heroes and villains to pursue each other through the convoluted plots of \"The Perils of Pauline\" and the other silent film serials in which she starred. In the 1930 detective novel \"The Maltese Falcon\", a small statuette provides both the book's title and its motive for intrigue.\nThe name MacGuffin was coined by British screenwriter Angus MacPhail. It has been posited that \"'guff', as a word for anything trivial or worthless, may lie at the root\".\nAlfred Hitchcock.\nDirector and producer Alfred Hitchcock popularized the term MacGuffin and the technique with his 1935 film \"The 39 Steps\", in which the MacGuffin is some otherwise incidental military secrets. Hitchcock explained the term MacGuffin in a 1939 lecture at Columbia University in New York City:\nIt might be a Scottish name, taken from a story about two men on a train. One man says, \"What's that package up there in the baggage rack?\" And the other answers, \"Oh, that's a MacGuffin.\" The first one asks, \"What's a MacGuffin?\" \"Well,\" the other man says, \"it's an apparatus for trapping lions in the Scottish Highlands.\" The first man says, \"But there are no lions in the Scottish Highlands,\" and the other one answers, \"Well then, that's no MacGuffin!\" So you see that a MacGuffin is actually nothing at all.\nIn a 1966 interview with Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, Hitchcock explained the term using the same story. He also related this anecdote in a television interview for Richard Schickel's documentary \"The Men Who Made the Movies\", and in an interview with Dick Cavett.\nHitchcock also said, \"The MacGuffin is the thing that the spies are after, but the audience doesn't care.\"\nIn Mel Brooks's parody of Hitchcock films, \"High Anxiety\" (1977), Brooks's character's hotel room is moved from the 2nd to the 17th floor at the request of \"a Mr. MacGuffin,\" a recognition by name of Hitchcock's use of the device.\nGeorge Lucas.\nIn contrast to Hitchcock's view, George Lucas believes that \"the audience should care about [the MacGuffin] almost as much as the dueling heroes and villains on-screen.\" Lucas describes R2-D2 as the MacGuffin of the original \"Star Wars\" film, and said that the Ark of the Covenant, the titular MacGuffin in \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", was an excellent example as opposed to the more obscure MacGuffin in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and the \"feeble\" MacGuffin in \"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\". The use of MacGuffins in Indiana Jones films later continued with the titular crystal skull in \"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\" and Archimedes' Dial in \"the Dial of Destiny\".\nYves Lavandier.\nFilmmaker and drama writing theorist Yves Lavandier suggests that a MacGuffin is a secret that motivates the villains. \"North by Northwest\"'s MacGuffin is nothing that motivates the protagonist; Roger Thornhill's objective is to extricate himself from the predicament that the mistaken identity has created, and what matters to Vandamm and the CIA is of little importance to Thornhill. A similar lack of motivating power applies to the MacGuffins of the 1930s films \"The Lady Vanishes\", \"The 39 Steps\", and \"Foreign Correspondent\". In a broader sense, says Lavandier, a MacGuffin denotes any justification for the external conflict in a work.\nFurther examples.\nAlfred Hitchcock popularized the use of the MacGuffin technique. Examples from Hitchcock's films include plans for a silent plane engine in \"The 39 Steps\" (1935), radioactive uranium ore in \"Notorious\" (1946), and a clause from a secret peace treaty in \"Foreign Correspondent\" (1940).\nThe briefcase in \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994) motivates several of the characters during many of the film's major plot points, but its contents are never revealed. \nSimilarly, the plot of the 1998 film \"Ronin\" revolves around a case, the contents of which remain unknown. At the end of the film, it is said to have led to a historic peace agreement and an end to the Troubles in Northern Ireland.\nGeorge Lucas also used MacGuffins in the \"Star Wars\" saga. He \"decided that the Force could be intensified through the possession of a mystical Kiber Crystal [\"sic\"].\"\nA similar usage was employed in John Carpenter's \"Escape from New York\", where the protagonist Snake Plissken is tasked with rescuing both the President of the United States and a cassette tape that will prevent a devastating war between the country and its enemies. While there are hints throughout the film, the contents of the tape are never revealed to the audience.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As usually presented, it prescribed that the Federal Republic would not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognized the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In fact it was more nuanced. There was no public official text of the \"doctrine\", but its main architect, Wilhelm Grewe, explained it publicly in a radio interview. Konrad Adenauer, who served as Chancellor of West Germany from 1949 to 1963, explained the outlines of the policy in a statement to the West German parliament on 22 September 1955. It meant that the Federal German government would regard it as an unfriendly act (\"acte peu amical\") if third countries were to recognize the \"German Democratic Republic\" (East Germany) or to maintain diplomatic relations with it\u00a0\u2013 with the exception of the Soviet Union (as one of the Four Powers responsible for Germany). The West German response to such could mean breaking off diplomatic relations, though this was not stated as an automatic response under the policy and in fact remained the \"ultima ratio\" (last resort).\nThe Federal Republic abandoned important aspects of the doctrine after 1970 when it became difficult to maintain, and the Federal government changed its politics towards the German Democratic Republic. The Four Power Agreement on Berlin in 1971 and the signing of the Basic Treaty in 1972 brought an end to the doctrine, in accordance with the new strategy of Ostpolitik.\nHistorical background.\nPartition of Germany.\nFollowing Germany's defeat in World War II, the territory east of the Oder\u2013Neisse line was under Soviet or Polish administration and had \"de facto\" been annexed. The rest of the territory west of that was divided into four occupation zones controlled by the Allies, with the former capital, Berlin, being similarly divided into four sectors.\nThe western zones controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States were merged, in May 1949, to form the \"Federal Republic of Germany\" (\"Bundesrepublik Deutschland\"); in October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the \"German Democratic Republic\" (\"Deutsche Demokratische Republik\", or DDR). They were informally known as \"West Germany\" and \"East Germany\". However, prior to 1954, the Allies still officially retained responsibility for the whole of Germany and neither East Germany nor West Germany had regained their sovereignty.\nThe Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which came into effect in 1949, was written as a constitution for the whole of Germany, including West Germany and East Germany. It laid down German reunification as a goal and a requirement and was proclaimed in the name of the whole of the German people.\nSoviet recognition of East Germany.\nOn 23 March 1954, the Soviet Union declared that it would establish diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic. This was seen as giving the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) a degree of legitimacy as a separate state. The West German government in Bonn rejected this, claiming that the Federal Republic of Germany was the legitimate heir of the German \"Reich\".\nGerman sovereignty.\nAfter the ratification of the Paris Accords on 5 May 1955, the General Treaty (\"Deutschlandvertrag\"), which largely restored (West) German sovereignty, took effect.\nExclusive mandate.\nThe government of the Federal Republic of Germany claimed to speak for the whole German people; this was re-iterated in a number of declarations. In the New York Declaration of 18 September 1951, the western occupying powers had declared that they \"regard[ed] the government of the Federal Republic of Germany as the only German government freely and legitimately constituted and therefore entitled to speak for the German nation in international affairs\".\nThe Federal Republic of Germany did not recognize the German Democratic Republic and maintained diplomatic relations with neither the German Democratic Republic nor the other Communist states of Eastern Europe.\nOrigin of the \"doctrine\".\nIn 1955 Konrad Adenauer visited Moscow, where agreement was reached that the Federal Republic of Germany and the Soviet Union would establish diplomatic relations. This was obviously in the interest of the Federal Republic of Germany but\u2014because the Soviet Union also maintained diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic\u2014it was apparently inconsistent with the exclusive mandate policy, which insisted that other states should not maintain diplomatic relations with both German \"states\". There was therefore a need to publicly define the policy and reinforce the message that the Federal Republic would not accept any other states maintaining diplomatic relations with both the Federal Republic of Germany and the (\"so-called\") German Democratic Republic.\nWalter Hallstein and Wilhelm Grewe were members of the delegation that accompanied Adenauer to Moscow. It was on the flight back from Moscow that the major elements of the policy were laid down, though elements of the policy had already been devised and practised by the Foreign Office before. Hallstein referred to the establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union in spite of the latter's recognition of East Germany as a \"singular act\" because of the Soviet Union's privileged status as an occupying power.\nAdenauer talked of the policy in a press conference on 16 September 1955 and again in a government statement to the parliament on 22 September 1955, warning other states that establishing diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic would be regarded as an unfriendly act. On 8 December 1955, there was a meeting of the heads of all major German embassies and the leadership of the Foreign Office. The policy of non-recognition of the German Democratic Republic was one of the main points on the agenda. The text of the speeches by Foreign Minister Brentano, Hallstein and Grewe were later distributed to embassies worldwide.\nAuthorship and name.\nThe Hallstein Doctrine was named after Walter Hallstein, then \"state secretary\" (the top civil servant) at the German Foreign Office, though largely devised and implemented by the head of the political department of the German Foreign Office, Wilhelm Grewe.\nAt the time the Hallstein Doctrine was born (or at least named), Heinrich von Brentano was the foreign minister, a post that had been recently created, after West Germany largely regained its sovereignty in 1955\u2014before this, political responsibility for foreign policy had been retained by the chancellor, Konrad Adenauer. Brentano is also known to have referred to the policy, or a variation of it as the Brentano Doctrine.\nSome time later, in 1958, journalists named the policy \"the Hallstein\u2013Grewe Doctrine\", and this later became shortened to \"the Hallstein Doctrine\". Grewe himself writes that he devised the broad outlines of the policy, but mainly as one of a number of options, the decisions being made by the foreign minister, Brentano, and the chancellor, Adenauer; in any case, the name Hallstein doctrine may be something of a misnomer.\nContent and rationale.\nThe Hallstein Doctrine followed from the Federal Republic's claimed exclusive mandate to represent the whole of Germany (the \"Alleinvertretungsanspruch\").\nIt specified that the Federal German government would regard it as an unfriendly act (\"acte peu amical\") if third countries were to recognize the \"German Democratic Republic\" (East Germany) or maintain diplomatic relations with it\u2014with the exception of the Soviet Union, as one of the Four Powers responsible for Germany. The response to such an unfriendly act was often understood to mean breaking off diplomatic relations, but this was \"not\" stated as an automatic response under the policy, though it remained the \"ultima ratio\".\nWhich actions short of official recognition and full diplomatic relations would trigger sanctions, and what these sanctions would be, was deliberately kept unclear\u2014at least publicly\u2014in order to prevent foreign governments testing the limits. Grewe warned privately that flexibility was essential and that it was not possible to pretend that the state-like entity of East Germany did not exist and gave the diplomatic service guidance on what sort of activities would be tolerated under the policy.\nNeither full diplomatic relations nor consular relations with similar recognition (exequatur) would be tolerated. The same applied to treaties that did not contain special provisos specifying that the treaty did not imply recognition. However, normal commercial activities, including non-state trade representations, etc. would be tolerated. There was also a considerable grey area open to interpretation. While Grewe was somewhat circumspect, the foreign minister, Brentano, made it clear that\u00a0\u2013 regardless of the economic consequences\u00a0\u2013 the Federal Republic would immediately break off diplomatic relations with any state that recognized the German Democratic Republic \"de jure\" or recognized the \"reality of two German states\".\nLegal basis.\nA legal expert produced a legal opinion setting out that the Soviet declaration (initiating diplomatic relations with the German Democratic Republic) had finally separated the Soviet Zone from the three western zones, but that, since it was under the control of the Soviet Union, it had no separate state government and therefore did not meet the minimum requirements of statehood. The legal opinion went on to claim that any state that had established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany or had declared an end of the state of war had implicitly recognized the Federal Republic as having an exclusive mandate to represent Germany.\nThe western allies, in various agreements, including the General Treaty of 1955, had agreed to recognize only the Federal Republic of Germany.\nThe western occupying powers (France, Britain, and the United States) accepted the continued existence of the pre-existing German State; and the New York Declaration of 18 September 1950 stated that they\n\"regard[ed] the government of the Federal Republic of Germany as the only German government freely and legitimately constituted and therefore entitled to speak for the German nation in international affairs\". An unpublished \"interpretative minute\" produced at the same time clarifies that the formula did not constitute recognition of the Government of the Federal Republic as the \"de jure\" government of all Germany\".\nThe legal justification for the policy was that there was an obligation (based on the constitution and the General Treaty, to strive for German re-unification and therefore to avoid or prevent recognition of East Germany and thus the division of Germany.\nThe political arguments were: that recognition implied acceptance of the division of Germany; that non-recognition meant rejection of the status quo; that non-recognition gave moral support to the population of East Germany in rejecting the Communist regime; that non-recognition weakened the international standing of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union and increased the standing of the Federal Republic of Germany; and that recognition of the German Democratic Republic would not lead to reunification because the other side would not be expected to commit political suicide.\nReaction of the German Democratic Republic (\"East Germany\").\nIn the beginning, the German Democratic Republic had pressed for re-unification, though they were not willing to accept free elections with UN participation. From about 1955, they favoured a \"two state\" solution and strongly objected to the Federal Republic's claim to represent the whole of Germany; but they made no such claims themselves. In the 1960s, after the building of the Berlin Wall, Walter Ulbricht, the East German leader increasingly claimed to represent the whole of Germany.\nWhenever the German Democratic Republic opened some form of representation in another country, they attempted to persuade that country to open a similar representation in the German Democratic Republic. Although they were willing to provide financial inducements for this purpose, their success was limited.\nFor the first stage in developing diplomatic relations, the German Democratic Republic often used the assistance of the local communist party in the country, and East German journalists were also pressed into service. The next stage was to establish a trade agreement. This was not especially problematic, because the Federal Republic of Germany did not object to trade relations, providing it did not involve explicit diplomatic recognition. Having established trade relations, the next stage was to establish permanent offices of the chamber of commerce. This, too, usually met with little resistance from the Federal Republic of Germany, provided the entities involved were not formally organs of the state. The next stage was to establish trade representations. These were usually tolerated by the Federal Republic of Germany, as long as there were no visible indications of diplomatic privileges, such as flying the official flag or pennant or invitation to official events normally reserved to the diplomatic corps. The German Democratic Republic increasingly used these for consular purposes and tried to \"upgrade\" them diplomatically by calling them \"trade missions\" and using diplomatic titles for their officers. This met with resistance on the part of the Federal Republic of Germany. The final stage that the German Democratic Republic aimed for was to establish a consulate general. This usually involved issuing an exequatur, a document that guarantees the consul's rights and privileges. This was regarded by the Federal Republic of Germany as equivalent to official diplomatic recognition and could be expected to be met with sanctions of some form. Countries such as Egypt attempted to avoid upsetting either side by issuing an exequatur but adding a note that it did not imply recognition of the German Democratic Republic.\nRight up to 1969, however, the German Democratic Republic was not able to achieve full diplomatic representation\u00a0\u2013 with two possible exceptions:\nHistory of the Hallstein Doctrine.\nThe doctrine was applied twice, to Yugoslavia in 1957, and to Cuba in 1963. Both had first recognized the GDR.\nIn 1958 the newly founded republic of Guinea accepted a Federal German ambassador and a GDR trade mission. When the country in 1960 sent an ambassador to GDR, the Federal Republic withdrew its own. Guinea then declared that it had never sent an ambassador to the GDR.\nProblems of the doctrine.\nThe doctrine seemed to succeed for a long time in isolating the GDR, at least from important Western or Third World states. But it also limited the federal government's politics, and in the 1960s it became more and more difficult to maintain.\nIn several cases, the doctrine was in fact not applied. When, in 1957, the GDR opened an office in Cairo to establish contact with the entire Arab world, the Federal Republic did not withdraw its ambassador from Egypt. Moreover, when in 1965 the Federal Republic established diplomatic relations with Israel, many Arab states ceased theirs with the Federal Republic but did not recognise the GDR. This eventually happened after 1967, because the GDR had supported the Arab states in the Six-Day War. The doctrine was also not applied to Cambodia in 1969, although it had recognised the GDR.\nThe Federal Republic established diplomatic relations with Romania in 1967 and reestablished those with Yugoslavia in 1968. The government's argument was that the communist states had been in fact forced to recognise the GDR and should not be punished for that.\nAbolition.\nIn 1969 Willy Brandt became German Chancellor as head of a social democrat / liberal government. The new government maintained the main political goals such as the German reunification in peace and freedom, but it altered the way to achieve these goals. Brandt's \"new Ostpolitik\" was a policy of negotiating with the German Democratic Republic government in order to improve the situation of Germans in German Democratic Republic and involved supporting visits from one part of Germany to the other. As part of this, the Federal Republic \"de jure\" recognized the German Democratic Republic as a state organisation of parts of Germany not within the Federal Republic, emphasizing that both German states could not be \"foreign\" to each other, that their relationships could be only of a special kind.\nThe Four Power Agreement on Berlin in 1971 and the signing of the Basic Treaty in 1972 brought an end to the doctrine, in accordance with the new strategy of Ostpolitik.\nSimilar situations.\nIn diplomacy the non-recognition of another state, and the discouraging of third states to do the same, is a common tactic. In the first years after the establishment of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, the United States refused to have diplomatic contact with them. Similar exclusive mandate policies (One-China policy) are still pursued by the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (on Taiwan), and the situation in Vietnam during the Vietnam War was somewhat similar.\nNovel approach.\nIn 2016, Torben G\u00fclstorff gave a new interpretation of the Hallstein doctrine. According to him, the doctrine's impact on the West and the East German foreign policy was only marginal, more myth than reality. During the entire Cold War, national economic and international geostrategic interests dominated German foreign affairs \u2013 on both sides of the wall.\nNotes and references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Influenced by Egon Bahr, who proposed \"change through rapprochement\" in a 1963 speech at the Evangelische Akademie Tutzing, the policies were implemented beginning with Willy Brandt, fourth Chancellor of the FRG from 1969 to 1974, and winner of the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to place this policy at the acme of the FRG.\n\"Ostpolitik\" was an effort to break with the policies of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which was the elected government of West Germany from 1949 until 1969. The Christian Democrats under Konrad Adenauer and his successors tried to combat the Communist government of East Germany, while Brandt's Social Democrats tried to achieve a certain degree of cooperation with East Germany.\nThe term \"Ostpolitik\" has since been applied to Pope Paul VI's efforts to engage Eastern European countries during the same period. The term \"Nordpolitik\" was also coined to describe similar rapprochement policies between North and South Korea beginning in the 1980s.\nIntention.\nFollowing the end of World War II in 1945, Allied-occupied Germany was split into two states: the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (GDR, or East Germany). Initially, both governments claimed that they represented the entire German nation. However, the Federal Republic saw itself as the only German government with democratic legitimacy. Later, at the end of the 1960s, the communist government of the GDR claimed that there was no longer a common German nation as the GDR had established a socialist nation.\nThe Christian Democratic Union (CDU) political party dominated West German governments from 1949 to 1969. These governments refused to have any contact with the GDR government due to its undemocratic character, and the Hallstein Doctrine stipulated that the FRG would withdraw diplomatic contact from any country that established diplomatic relations with the GDR. The first application of the Hallstein Doctrine was in 1957, when the FRG withdrew recognition of Yugoslavia after it accepted a GDR ambassador. In the 1960s it became obvious that this policy would not work forever. When the Federal Republic established diplomatic relations with Israel in 1965, the Arab states countered by breaking off relations with the Federal Republic and establishing relations with the GDR.\nEven before his election as Chancellor, Willy Brandt, the Social Democratic mayor of West Berlin, argued for and pursued policies that would ease tensions between the two German states, generally in the interest of cross-border commerce. His proposed new \"Ostpolitik\" held that the Hallstein Doctrine did not help to undermine the communist government or even lighten the situation of the Germans in the GDR. Brandt believed that collaboration with the communists would foster German-German encounters and trade that would undermine the communist government over the long term.\nNonetheless, he stressed that his new \"Ostpolitik\" did not neglect the close ties of the Federal Republic with Western Europe and the United States or its membership in NATO. Indeed, by the late 1960s, the unwavering stance of the Hallstein Doctrine was actually considered detrimental to US interests; numerous American advisors and policymakers, most notably Henry Kissinger, urged Bonn to be more flexible. At the same time, other West European countries entered a period of more daring policy directed to the East. When Brandt became Chancellor in 1969, the same politicians now feared a more independent German \"Ostpolitik\", a new \"Rapallo\". France feared that West Germany would become more powerful after d\u00e9tente; Brandt ultimately resorted to pressuring the French government into endorsing his policy by holding out German financial contributions to the European Common Agricultural Policy.\nRealisation.\nThe easing of tensions with the East envisioned by \"Ostpolitik\" necessarily began with the Soviet Union, the only Eastern Bloc state with which the Federal Republic had formal diplomatic ties (despite the aforementioned Hallstein Doctrine). In 1970 Brandt signed the Treaty of Moscow, renouncing the use of force and recognizing the current European borders. Later that year, Brandt signed the Treaty of Warsaw, in the process formally recognizing the People's Republic of Poland. The Treaty of Warsaw essentially repeated the Moscow treaty, and in particular reiterated the Federal Republic's recognition of the Oder\u2013Neisse line. Treaties with other Eastern European countries followed.\nThe most controversial agreement was the Basic Treaty of 1972 with East Germany, establishing formal relations between the two German states for the first time since partition. The situation was complicated by the Federal Republic's longstanding claim to represent the entire German nation; Chancellor Brandt sought to smooth over this point by repeating his 1969 statement that although two states exist in Germany, they cannot regard one another as foreign countries.\nThe conservative CDU opposition party in the Bundestag refused the Basic Treaty because they thought that the government gave away some Federal positions too easily. They also criticized flaws like the unintentional publishing of the \"Bahr-Papier\", a paper in which Brandt's right hand Egon Bahr had agreed with Soviet diplomat Valentin Falin on essential issues.\nThe Brandt government, a coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats, lost a number of MPs to the CDU opposition in protest over the Basic Treaty. In April 1972 it even seemed that opposition leader Rainer Barzel had enough support to become the new Chancellor, but in the parliamentary he came two votes short. It later emerged that the GDR had paid the two CDU deputies to vote against Barzel. New general elections in November 1972 gave the Brandt government a victory, and on 11 May 1973 the Federal Parliament approved the Basic Treaty.\nAccording to the Basic Treaty the Federal Republic and GDR accepted each other's de facto ambassadors, termed \"permanent representatives\" for political reasons. The mutual recognition opened the door for both states to join the United Nations, as the Federal Republic's claim to representing the entire German nation was essentially dropped by the act of recognizing its Eastern counterpart.\nThe CDU/CSU persuaded the FDP to defect from its coalition with the SPD in 1982, and thus CDU leader Helmut Kohl became Chancellor of West Germany. However, he did not change West German policy towards the GDR. Such was the consensus that \"Ostpolitik\" had been vindicated that Bavarian Minister-President Franz Josef Strau\u00df, who had fiercely fought against the Basic Treaty and was Kohl's main opponent within the CDU/CSU bloc, secured the passage of a Kohl-initiated loan of 3\u00a0billion marks to the GDR in 1983. In 1987, East German leader Erich Honecker became the first ever East German head of state to visit West Germany, which was generally seen as a sign that Kohl pursued \"Ostpolitik\".\nPolicies similar to Ostpolitik.\nPre-WW2 diplomacy.\nGerman states (Prussia and Saxony as well as unified Germany) have long faced the issues of co-existing with their eastern neighbours, whatever the differences in culture, beliefs and outlook.\nBismarck's complex foreign-policy balances included the 1887 Reinsurance Treaty with the German Empire's eastern neighbour, the Russian Empire.\nWeimar Germany broke out of a degree of diplomatic isolation by signing the Treaty of Rapallo with Soviet Russia in 1922.\nThe Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 defied ideological differences and established trade and geopolitical agreements between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.\nVatican diplomacy.\n\"Ostpolitik\" is also the name given to the policies of Pope Paul VI (in office: 1963-1978) towards the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellite states. Trying to improve the condition of Christians in general and Catholics in particular behind the Iron Curtain, he engaged in dialogue with Communist authorities at several levels, receiving Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko and USSR head of state Nikolai Podgorny in 1966 and 1967 in the Vatican. The situation of the Church in Poland, Hungary and Romania improved somewhat during his pontificate.\nAmong the factors behind the development of \"Ostpolitik\" in the Vatican was the Cuban missile crisis, which exemplified the risk of nuclear war.17 Holy See diplomats including Cardinal Agostino Casaroli became convinced that the Catholic Church had been too reluctant to engage with the communist countries.17 The Holy See decided that it should downplay the role of ideological conflicts in international relations and reduce the Vatican's anti-communist rhetoric.17 The Vatican also sought to use this approach to make the sacraments and church public life more available in the communist countries.17\nSouth Korea.\nSouth Korea's 1980s policy of \"Nordpolitik\" was named in allusion to \"Ostpolitik\".\nA similar concept is Sunshine Policy, which is the main North Korea policies of the Democratic Party of Korea.\nList of treaties.\nThese are West German treaties that have \"Ostpolitik\" as a primary or secondary policy goal:\nLater agreements in the period of Christian Democrat Helmut Kohl (from 1982 through German reunification in 1990), although dealing with similar issues and having similar goals, are not considered to be \"Ostpolitik\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Glycomics \"is the systematic study of all glycan structures of a given cell type or organism\" and is a subset of glycobiology. The term glycomics is derived from the chemical prefix for sweetness or a sugar, \"glyco-\", and was formed to follow the \"omics\" naming convention established by genomics (which deals with genes) and proteomics (which deals with proteins).\nChallenges.\nThis area of research has to deal with an inherent level of complexity not seen in other areas of applied biology. 68 building blocks (molecules for DNA, RNA and proteins; categories for lipids; types of sugar linkages for saccharides) provide the structural basis for the molecular choreography that constitutes the entire life of a cell. DNA and RNA have four building blocks each (the nucleosides or nucleotides). Lipids are divided into eight categories based on ketoacyl and isoprene. Proteins have 20 (the amino acids). Saccharides have 32 types of sugar linkages. While these building blocks can be attached only linearly for proteins and genes, they can be arranged in a branched array for saccharides, further increasing the degree of complexity.\nAdd to this the complexity of the numerous proteins involved, not only as carriers of carbohydrate, the glycoproteins, but proteins specifically involved in binding and reacting with carbohydrate:\nImportance.\nTo answer this question one should know the different and important functions of glycans. The following are some of those functions:\nThere are important medical applications of aspects of glycomics:\nGlycomics is particularly important in microbiology because glycans play diverse roles in bacterial physiology. Research in bacterial glycomics could lead to the development of:\nTools used.\nThe following are examples of the commonly used techniques in glycan analysis\nHigh-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\nThe most commonly applied methods are MS and HPLC, in which the glycan part is cleaved either enzymatically or chemically from the target and subjected to analysis. In case of glycolipids, they can be analyzed directly without separation of the lipid component.\nN-glycans from glycoproteins are analyzed routinely by high-performance-liquid-chromatography (reversed phase, normal phase and ion exchange HPLC) after tagging the reducing end of the sugars with a fluorescent compound (reductive labeling).\nA large variety of different labels were introduced in the recent years, where 2-aminobenzamide (AB), anthranilic acid (AA), 2-aminopyridin (PA), 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) and 3-(acetylamino)-6-aminoacridine (AA-Ac) are just a few of them.\nO-glycans are usually analysed without any tags, due to the chemical release conditions preventing them to be labeled.\nFractionated glycans from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) instruments can be further analyzed by MALDI-TOF-MS(MS) to get further information about structure and purity. Sometimes glycan pools are analyzed directly by mass spectrometry without prefractionation, although a discrimination between isobaric glycan structures is more challenging or even not always possible. Anyway, direct MALDI-TOF-MS analysis can lead to a fast and straightforward illustration of the glycan pool.\nIn recent years, high performance liquid chromatography online coupled to mass spectrometry became very popular. By choosing porous graphitic carbon as a stationary phase for liquid chromatography, even non derivatized glycans can be analyzed. Electrospray ionisation (ESI) is frequently used for this application.\nMultiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM).\nAlthough MRM has been used extensively in metabolomics and proteomics, its high sensitivity and linear response over a wide dynamic range make it especially suited for glycan biomarker research and discovery. MRM is performed on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) instrument, which is set to detect a predetermined precursor ion in the first quadrupole, a fragmented in the collision quadrupole, and a predetermined fragment ion in the third quadrupole. It is a non-scanning technique, wherein each transition is detected individually and the detection of multiple transitions occurs concurrently in duty cycles. This technique is being used to characterize the immune glycome.\nTable 1: Advantages and disadvantages of mass spectrometry in glycan analysis\nArrays.\nLectin and antibody arrays provide high-throughput screening of many samples containing glycans. This method uses either naturally occurring lectins or artificial monoclonal antibodies, where both are immobilized on a certain chip and incubated with a fluorescent glycoprotein sample.\nGlycan arrays, like that offered by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics and http://, contain carbohydrate compounds that can be screened with lectins or antibodies to define carbohydrate specificity and identify ligands.\nMetabolic and covalent labeling of glycans.\nMetabolic labeling of glycans can be used as a way to detect glycan structures. A well known strategy involves the use of azide-labeled sugars which can be reacted using the Staudinger ligation. This method has been used for in vitro and in vivo imaging of glycans.\nTools for glycoproteins.\nX-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy for complete structural analysis of complex glycans is a difficult and complex field. However, the structure of the binding site of numerous lectins, enzymes and other carbohydrate-binding proteins has revealed a wide variety of the structural basis for glycome function. The purity of test samples have been obtained through chromatography (affinity chromatography etc.) and analytical electrophoresis (PAGE (polyacrylamide electrophoresis), capillary electrophoresis, affinity electrophoresis, etc.).\nSoftware and databases.\nThere are several online software and databases available for glycomics research.

It is the first vaccine to have been developed against a contagious disease. In 1796, British physician Edward Jenner demonstrated that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus conferred immunity against the deadly smallpox virus. Cowpox served as a natural vaccine until the modern smallpox vaccine emerged in the 20th century. From 1958 to 1977, the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a global vaccination campaign that eradicated smallpox, making it the only human disease to be eradicated. Although routine smallpox vaccination is no longer performed on the general public, the vaccine is still being produced for research, and to guard against bioterrorism, biological warfare, and mpox.\nThe term \"vaccine\" derives from \"vacca\", the Latin word for cow, reflecting the origins of smallpox vaccination. Edward Jenner referred to cowpox as \"variolae vaccinae\" (smallpox of the cow). The origins of the smallpox vaccine became murky over time, especially after Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques for creating vaccines in the 19th century. Allan Watt Downie demonstrated in 1939 that the modern smallpox vaccine was serologically distinct from cowpox, and \"vaccinia\" was subsequently recognized as a separate viral species. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that \"vaccinia\" is most closely related to horsepox, and the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the least closely related to \"vaccinia\".\nTypes.\nAs the oldest vaccine, the smallpox vaccine has gone through several generations of medical technology. From 1796 to the 1880s, the vaccine was transmitted from one person to another through arm-to-arm vaccination. Smallpox vaccine was successfully maintained in cattle starting in the 1840s, and calf lymph vaccine became the leading smallpox vaccine in the 1880s. First-generation vaccines grown on the skin of live animals were widely distributed in the 1950s\u20131970s to eradicate smallpox. Second-generation vaccines were grown in chorioallantoic membrane or cell cultures for greater purity, and they were used in some areas during the smallpox eradication campaign. Third-generation vaccines are based on attenuated strains of \"vaccinia\" and saw limited use prior to the eradication of smallpox.\nAll three generations of vaccine are available in stockpiles. First and second-generation vaccines contain live unattenuated \"vaccinia\" virus and can cause serious side effects in a small percentage of recipients, including death in 1\u201310 people per million vaccinations. Third-generation vaccines are much safer due to the milder side effects of the attenuated \"vaccinia\" strains. Second and third-generation vaccines are still being produced, with manufacturing capacity being built up in the 2000s due to fears of bioterrorism and biological warfare.\nFirst-generation.\nThe first-generation vaccines are manufactured by growing live \"vaccinia\" virus in the skin of live animals. Most first-generation vaccines are calf lymph vaccines that were grown on the skin of cows, but other animals were also used, including sheep. The development of freeze-dried vaccine in the 1950s made it possible to preserve \"vaccinia\" virus for long periods of time without refrigeration, leading to the availability of freeze-dried vaccines such as Dryvax.\nThe vaccine is administered by multiple puncture of the skin (scarification) with a bifurcated needle that holds vaccine solution in the fork. The skin should be cleaned with water rather than alcohol, as the alcohol could inactivate the \"vaccinia\" virus. If alcohol is used, it must be allowed to evaporate completely before the vaccine is administered. Vaccination results in a skin lesion that fills with pus and eventually crusts over. This manifestation of localized \"vaccinia\" infection is known as a vaccine \"take\" and demonstrates immunity to smallpox. After 2\u20133 weeks, the scab will fall off and leave behind a vaccine scar.\nFirst generation vaccines consist of live, unattenuated \"vaccinia\" virus. One-third of first-time vaccinees develop side effects significant enough to miss school, work, or other activities, or have difficulty sleeping. 15\u201320% of children receiving the vaccine for the first time develop fevers of over . The \"vaccinia\" lesion can transmit the virus to other people. Rare side effects include postvaccinal encephalitis and myopericarditis. Many countries have stockpiled first generation smallpox vaccines. In a 2006 predictive analysis of casualties if there were a mass vaccination of the populations of Germany and the Netherlands, it was estimated that a total of 9.8 people in the Netherlands and 46.2 people in Germany would die from uncontrolled \"vaccinia\" infection after being vaccinated with the New York City Board of Health strain. More deaths were predicted for vaccines based other strains: Lister (55.1 Netherlands, 268.5 Germany) and Bern (303.5 Netherlands, 1,381 Germany).\nSecond-generation.\nThe second-generation vaccines consist of live \"vaccinia\" virus grown in the chorioallantoic membrane or cell culture. The second-generation vaccines are also administered through scarification with a bifurcated needle, and they carry the same side effects as the first-generation \"vaccinia\" strain that was cloned. However, the use of eggs or cell culture allows for vaccine production in a sterile environment, while first-generation vaccine contains skin bacteria from the animal that the vaccine was grown on.\nErnest William Goodpasture, Alice Miles Woodruff, and G. John Buddingh grew \"vaccinia\" virus on the chorioallantoic membrane of chicken embryos in 1932. The Texas Department of Health began producing egg-based vaccine in 1939 and started using it in vaccination campaigns in 1948. Lederle Laboratories began selling its Avianized smallpox vaccine in the United States in 1959. Egg-based vaccine was also used widely in Brazil, New Zealand, and Sweden, and on a smaller scale in many other countries. Concerns about temperature stability and avian sarcoma leukosis virus prevented it from being used more widely during the eradication campaign, although no increase in leukemia was seen in Brazil and Sweden despite the presence of ASLV in the chickens.\n\"Vaccinia\" was first grown in cell culture in 1931 by Thomas Milton Rivers. The WHO funded work in the 1960s at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) on growing the Lister/Elstree strain in rabbit kidney cells and tested it in 45,443 Indonesian children in 1973, with comparable results to the same strain of calf lymph vaccine. Two other cell culture vaccines were developed from the Lister strain in the 2000s: Elstree-BN (Bavarian Nordic) and VV Lister CEP (Chicken Embryo Primary, Sanofi Pasteur). Lister/Elstree-RIVM was stockpiled in the Netherlands, and Elstree-BN was sold to some European countries for stockpiles. However, Sanofi dropped its own vaccine after it acquired Acambis in 2008.\nACAM2000 is a vaccine developed by Acambis, which was acquired by Sanofi Pasteur in 2008, before selling the smallpox vaccine to Emergent Biosolutions in 2017. Six strains of \"vaccinia\" were isolated from 3,000 doses of Dryvax and found to exhibit significant variation in virulence. The strain with the most similar virulence to the overall Dryvax mixture was selected and grown in MRC-5 cells to make the ACAM1000 vaccine. After a successful phase I trial of ACAM1000, the virus was passaged three times in Vero cells to develop ACAM2000, which entered mass production at Baxter. The United States ordered over 200 million doses of ACAM2000 in 1999\u20132001 for its stockpile, and production is ongoing to replace expired vaccine.\nACAM2000 was approved for mpox prevention in the United States in August 2024.\nThird-generation.\nThe third-generation vaccines are based on attenuated \"vaccinia\" viruses that are much less virulent and carry lesser side effects. The attenuated viruses may be replicating or non-replicating.\nMVA.\nModified vaccinia Ankara (MVA, ) is a replication-incompetent variant of \"vaccinia\" that was developed in West Germany through serial passage. The original Ankara strain of \"vaccinia\" was maintained at the vaccine institute in Ankara, Turkey on donkeys and cows. The Ankara strain was taken to West Germany in 1953, where Herrlich and Mayr grew it on chorioallantoic membrane at the University of Munich. After 572 serial passages, the \"vaccinia\" virus had lost over 14% of its genome and could no longer replicate in human cells. MVA was used in West Germany in 1977\u20131980, but the eradication of smallpox ended the vaccination campaign after only 120,000 doses.\nMVA stimulates the production of fewer antibodies than replicating vaccines. During the smallpox eradication campaign, MVA was considered to be a pre-vaccine that would be administered before a replicating vaccine to reduce the side effects, or an alternative vaccine that could be safely given to people at high risk from a replicating vaccine. Japan evaluated MVA and rejected it due to its low immunogenicity, deciding to develop its own attenuated vaccine instead. In the 2000s, MVA was tested in animal models at much higher dosages. When MVA is given to monkeys at 40 times the dosage of Dryvax, it stimulates a more rapid immune response while still causing lesser side effects.\nMVA-BN.\nMVA-BN (also known as: Imvanex in the European Union; Imvamune in Canada; and Jynneos) is a vaccine manufactured by Bavarian Nordic by growing MVA in cell culture. Unlike replicating vaccines, MVA-BN is administered by injection via the subcutaneous route and does not result in a vaccine \"take.\" A \"take\" or \"major cutaneous reaction\" is a pustular lesion or an area of definite induration or congestion surrounding a central lesion, which can be a scab or an ulcer.\nMVA-BN can also be administered intradermally to increase the number of available doses. It is safer for immunocompromised patients and those who are at risk from a \"vaccinia\" infection. MVA-BN has been approved in the European Union, Canada, and the United States. Clinical trials have found that MVA-BN is safer and just as immunogenic as ACAM2000. This vaccine has also been approved for use against mpox.\nLC16m8.\nLC16m8 is a replicating attenuated strain of \"vaccinia\" that is manufactured by Kaketsuken in Japan. Working at the Chiba Serum Institute in Japan, So Hashizume passaged the Lister strain 45 times in primary rabbit kidney cells, interrupting the process after passages 36, 42, and 45 to grow clones on chorioallantoic membrane and select for pock size. The resulting variant was designated LC16m8 (Lister clone 16, medium pocks, clone 8). Unlike the severely-damaged MVA, LC16m8 contains every gene that is present in the ancestral \"vaccinia\". However, a single-nucleotide deletion truncates membrane protein B5R from a residue length of 317 to 92. Although the truncated protein decreases production of extracellular enveloped virus, animal models have shown that antibodies against other membrane proteins are sufficient for immunity. LC16m8 was approved in Japan in 1975 after testing in over 50,000 children. Vaccination with LC16m8 results in a vaccine \"take\", but safety is similar to MVA.\nSafety.\nVaccinia is infectious, which improves its effectiveness, but causes serious complications for people with impaired immune systems (for example chemotherapy and AIDS patients) or history of eczema, and pregnant women. It is also not recommended for anyone who lives with someone who belongs to any of the aforementioned groups. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"within 3 days of being exposed to the virus, the vaccine might protect you from getting the disease. If you still get the disease, you might get much less sick than an unvaccinated person would. Within 4 to 7 days of being exposed to the virus, the vaccine likely gives you some protection from the disease. If you still get the disease, you might not get as sick as an unvaccinated person would.\"\nIn May 2007, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted unanimously that a new live virus vaccine produced by Acambis, ACAM2000, is both safe and effective for use in persons at high risk of exposure to smallpox virus. However, due to the high rate of serious adverse effects, the vaccine will only be made available to the CDC for the Strategic National Stockpile. ACAM2000 was approved for medical use in the United States in August 2007.\nStockpiles.\nSince smallpox has been eradicated, the public is not routinely vaccinated against the disease. The World Health Organization maintained a stockpile of 200million doses in 1980, to guard against reemergence of the disease, but 99% of the stockpile was destroyed in the late 1980s when smallpox failed to return. After the September 11 attacks in 2001, many governments began building up vaccine stockpiles again for fear of bioterrorism. Several companies sold off their stockpiles of vaccines manufactured in the 1970s, and production of smallpox vaccines resumed. Aventis Pasteur discovered a stockpile from the 1950s and donated it to the US government.\nStockpiles of newer vaccines must be repurchased periodically since they carry expiration dates. The United States had received 269 million doses of ACAM2000 and 28 million doses of MVA-BN by 2019, but only 100 million doses of ACAM2000 and 65,000 doses of MVA-BN were still available from the stockpile at the start of the 2022\u20132023 mpox outbreak. First-generation vaccines have no specified expiration date and remain viable indefinitely in deep freeze. The U.S. stockpile of WetVax was manufactured in 1956\u20131957 and maintained since then at , and it was still effective when tested in 2004. Replicating vaccines also remain effective even at 1:10 dilution, so a limited number of doses can be stretched to cover a much larger population.\nHistory.\nVariolation.\nThe mortality of the severe form of smallpox \u2013 \"variola major\" \u2013 was very high without vaccination, up to 35% in some outbreaks. A method of inducing immunity known as inoculation, insufflation or \"variolation\" was practiced before the development of a modern vaccine and likely occurred in Africa and China well before the practice arrived in Europe. It may also have occurred in India, but this is disputed; other investigators contend the ancient Sanskrit medical texts of India do not describe these techniques. The first clear reference to smallpox inoculation was made by the Chinese author Wan Quan (1499\u20131582) in his \"Douzhen xinfa\" (\u75d8\u75b9\u5fc3\u6cd5) published in 1549. Inoculation for smallpox does not appear to have been widespread in China until the reign era of the Longqing Emperor (r. 1567\u20131572) during the Ming Dynasty. In China, powdered smallpox scabs were blown up the noses of the healthy. The patients would then develop a mild case of the disease and from then on were immune to it. The technique did have a 0.5\u20132.0% mortality rate, but that was considerably less than the 20\u201330% mortality rate of the disease itself. Two reports on the Chinese practice of inoculation were received by the Royal Society in London in 1700; one by Dr. Martin Lister who received a report by an employee of the East India Company stationed in China and another by Clopton Havers. According to Voltaire (1742), the Turks derived their use of inoculation from neighbouring Circassia. Voltaire does not speculate on where the Circassians derived their technique from, though he reports that the Chinese have practiced it \"these hundred years\".\nVariolation was also practiced throughout the latter half of the 17th century by physicians in Turkey, Persia, and Africa. In 1714 and 1716, two reports of the Ottoman Empire Turkish method of inoculation were made to the Royal Society in England, by Emmanuel Timoni, a doctor affiliated with the British Embassy in Constantinople, and Giacomo Pylarini. Source material tells us on Lady Mary Wortley Montagu; \"When Lady Mary was in the Ottoman Empire, she discovered the local practice of inoculation against smallpox called variolation.\" In 1718 she had her son, aged five, variolated. He recovered quickly. She returned to London and had her daughter variolated in 1721 by Charles Maitland, during an epidemic of smallpox. This encouraged the British royal family to take an interest and a trial of variolation was carried out on prisoners in Newgate Prison. This was successful and in 1722 Caroline of Ansbach, the Princess of Wales, allowed Maitland to vaccinate her children. The success of these variolations assured the British people that the procedure was safe.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n...scarred the wrists, legs, and forehead of the patient, placed a fresh and kindly pock in each incision and bound it there for eight or ten days, after this time the patient was credibly informed. The patient would then develop a mild case [of smallpox], recover, and thereafter be immune.\n\u2014Dr. Peter Kennedy\nStimulated by a severe epidemic, variolation was first employed in North America in 1721. The procedure had been known in Boston since 1706, when preacher Cotton Mather learned it from Onesimus, a man he held as a slave, who \u2013 like many of his peers \u2013 had been inoculated in Africa before they were kidnapped. This practice was widely criticized at first. However, a limited trial showed six deaths that had occurred out of 244 were variolated (2.5%), while 844 out of 5980 died of natural disease (14%), and the process was widely adopted throughout the colonies.\nThe inoculation technique was documented as having a mortality rate of only one in a thousand. Two years after Kennedy's description appeared, March 1718, Dr. Charles Maitland successfully inoculated the five-year-old son of the British ambassador to the Turkish court under orders from the ambassador's wife Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, who four years later introduced the practice to England.\nAn account from letter by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to Sarah Chiswell, dated 1 April 1717, from the Turkish Embassy describes this treatment:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The small-pox so fatal and so general amongst us is here entirely harmless by the invention of ingrafting (which is the term they give it). There is a set of old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. ... The children or young patients play together all the rest of the day and are in perfect health till the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before the illness. ... There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of the experiment since I intend to try it on my dear little son. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind, but that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it. Perhaps if I live to return I may, however, have courage to war with them.\nEarly vaccination.\nIn the early empirical days of vaccination, before Louis Pasteur's work on establishing the germ theory and Joseph Lister's on antisepsis and asepsis, there was considerable cross-infection. William Woodville, one of the early vaccinators and director of the London Smallpox Hospital is thought to have contaminated the cowpox matter \u2013 the vaccine \u2013 with smallpox matter and this essentially produced variolation. Other vaccine material was not reliably derived from cowpox, but from other skin eruptions of cattle.\nDuring the earlier days of empirical experimentation in 1758, American Calvinist Jonathan Edwards died from a smallpox inoculation. Some of the earliest statistical and epidemiological studies were performed by James Jurin in 1727 and Daniel Bernoulli in 1766. In 1768, Dr John Fewster reported that variolation induced no reaction in persons who had had cowpox.\nEdward Jenner was born in Berkeley, England. As a young child, Jenner was variolated with the other schoolboys through parish funds, but nearly died due to the seriousness of his infection. Fed purgative medicine and going through the bloodletting process, Jenner was put in one of the variolation stables until he recovered. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to apothecary Daniel Ludlow and later surgeon George Hardwick in nearby Sodbury. He observed that people who caught cowpox while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox. Jenner assumed a causal connection but the idea was not taken up at that time. From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St. George's Hospital and as the private pupil of John Hunter, then returned to set up practice in Berkeley.\nPerhaps there was already an informal public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle. The \"beautiful milkmaid\" seems to have been a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But it is known for certain that in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, Jesty 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans.\nJenner sent a paper reporting his observations to the Royal Society in April 1797. It was not submitted formally and there is no mention of it in the Society's records. Jenner had sent the paper informally to Sir Joseph Banks, the Society's president, who asked Everard Home for his views. Reviews of his rejected report, published for the first time in 1999, were skeptical and called for further vaccinations. Additional vaccinations were performed and in 1798 Jenner published his work entitled \"An Inquiry into the Causes and Effects of the Variolae Vaccinae, a disease discovered in some of the western counties of England, particularly Gloucestershire and Known by the Name of Cow Pox.\" It was an analysis of 23 cases including several individuals who had resisted natural exposure after previous cowpox. It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus; e.g. Case 21 included 'several children and adults'. Crucially all of at least four whom Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it. These included the first and last patients in a series of arm-to-arm transfers. He concluded that cowpox inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation, but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong. This last proved to be incorrect. Jenner also tried to distinguish between 'True' cowpox which produced the desired result and 'Spurious' cowpox which was ineffective and/or produced severe reaction. Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would be recognised as a non-infectious vaccine, a different virus (e.g. paravaccinia/milker's nodes), or contaminating bacterial pathogens. This caused confusion at the time, but would become important criteria in vaccine development. A further source of confusion was Jenner's belief that fully effective vaccine obtained from cows originated in an equine disease, which he mistakenly referred to as \"grease\". This was criticised at the time but vaccines derived from horsepox were soon introduced and later contributed to the complicated problem of the origin of vaccinia virus, the virus in present-day vaccine.\nThe introduction of the vaccine to the New World took place in Trinity, Newfoundland, in 1798 by Dr. John Clinch, boyhood friend and medical colleague of Jenner. The first smallpox vaccine in the United States was administered in 1799. The physician Valentine Seaman gave his children a smallpox vaccination using a serum acquired from Jenner. By 1800, Jenner's work had been published in all the major European languages and had reached Benjamin Waterhouse in the United States \u2013 an indication of rapid spread and deep interest. Despite some concern about the safety of vaccination the mortality using carefully selected vaccine was close to zero, and it was soon in use all over Europe and the United States.\nIn 1804 the Balmis Expedition, an official Spanish mission commanded by Francisco Javier de Balmis, sailed to spread the vaccine throughout the Spanish Empire, first to the Canary Islands and on to Spanish Central America. While his deputy, Jos\u00e9 Salvany, took vaccine to the west and east coasts of Spanish South America, Balmis sailed to Manila in the Philippines and on to Canton and Macao on the Chinese coast. He returned to Spain in 1806. The vaccine was not carried in the form of flasks, but in the form of 22 orphaned boys, who were 'carriers' of the live cowpox virus. After arrival, \"other Spanish governors and doctors used enslaved girls to move the virus between islands, using lymph fluid harvested from them to inoculate their local populations\".\nNapoleon was an early proponent of smallpox vaccination and ordered that army recruits be given the vaccine. Additionally a vaccination program was created for the French Army and his Imperial Guard. In 1811 he had his son, Napoleon II, vaccinated after his birth. By 1815 about half of French children were vaccinated and by the end of the Napoleonic Empire smallpox deaths accounted for 1.8% of deaths, as opposed to the 4.8% of deaths it accounted for at the time of the French Revolution.\nOn March 26, 1806, the Swiss canton Thurgau became the first state in the world to introduce compulsory smallpox vaccinations, by order of the cantonal councillor \"Jakob Christoph Scherb\". Half a year later, Elisa Bonaparte issued a corresponding order for her Principality of Lucca and Piombino on 25 December 1806. On 26 August 1807, Bavaria introduced a similar measure. Baden followed in 1809, Prussia in 1815, W\u00fcrttemberg in 1818, Sweden in 1816, England in 1867 and the German Empire in 1874 through the Reichs Vaccination Act. In Lutheran Sweden, the Protestant clergy played a pioneering role in voluntary smallpox vaccination as early as 1800. The first vaccination was carried out in Liechtenstein in 1801, and from 1812 it was mandatory to vaccinate.\nThe question of who first tried cowpox inoculation/vaccination cannot be answered with certainty. Most, but still limited, information is available for Benjamin Jesty, Peter Plett and John Fewster. In 1774 Jesty, a farmer of Yetminster in Dorset, observing that the two milkmaids living with his family were immune to smallpox, inoculated his family with cowpox to protect them from smallpox. He attracted a certain amount of local criticism and ridicule at the time then interest waned. Attention was later drawn to Jesty, and he was brought to London in 1802 by critics jealous of Jenner's prominence at a time when he was applying to Parliament for financial reward. During 1790\u201392 Peter Plett, a teacher from Holstein, reported limited results of cowpox inoculation to the Medical Faculty of the University of Kiel. However, the Faculty favoured variolation and took no action. John Fewster, a surgeon friend of Jenner's from nearby Thornbury, discussed the possibility of cowpox inoculation at meetings as early as 1765. He may have done some cowpox inoculations in 1796 at about the same time that Jenner vaccinated Phipps. However, Fewster, who had a flourishing variolation practice, may have considered this option but used smallpox instead. He thought vaccination offered no advantage over variolation, but maintained friendly contact with Jenner and certainly made no claim of priority for vaccination when critics attacked Jenner's reputation. It seems clear that the idea of using cowpox instead of smallpox for inoculation was considered, and actually tried in the late 18th century, and not just by the medical profession. Therefore, Jenner was not the first to try cowpox inoculation. However, he was the first to publish his evidence and distribute vaccine freely, provide information on selection of suitable material, and maintain it by arm-to-arm transfer. The authors of the official World Health Organization (WHO) account \"Smallpox and its Eradication\" assessing Jenner's role wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Publication of the Inquiry and the subsequent energetic promulgation by Jenner of the idea of vaccination with a virus other than variola virus constituted a watershed in the control of smallpox for which he, more than anyone else deserves the credit.\nAs vaccination spread, some European countries made it compulsory. Concern about its safety led to opposition and then repeal of legislation in some instances. Compulsory infant vaccination was introduced in England by the Vaccination Act 1853 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 100). By 1871, parents could be fined for non-compliance, and then imprisoned for non-payment. This intensified opposition, and the Vaccination Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 49) introduced a conscience clause. This allowed exemption on production of a certificate of conscientious objection signed by two magistrates. Such certificates were not always easily obtained and a further act in 1907 allowed exemption by a statutory declaration which could not be refused. Although theoretically still compulsory, the Vaccination Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7. c. 31) effectively marked the end of compulsory infant vaccination in England.\nIn the United States vaccination was regulated by individual states, the first to impose compulsory vaccination being Massachusetts in 1809. There then followed sequences of compulsion, opposition and repeal in various states. By 1930 Arizona, Utah, North Dakota and Minnesota prohibited compulsory vaccination, 35 states allowed regulation by local authorities, or had no legislation affecting vaccination, whilst in ten states, including Washington, D.C. and Massachusetts, infant vaccination was compulsory. Compulsory infant vaccination was regulated by only allowing access to school for those who had been vaccinated. Those seeking to enforce compulsory vaccination argued that the public good overrode personal freedom, a view supported by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Jacobson v. Massachusetts\" in 1905, a landmark ruling which set a precedent for cases dealing with personal freedom and the public good.\nLouis T. Wright, an African-American Harvard Medical School graduate (1915), introduced, while serving in the Army during World War I, intradermal, smallpox vaccination for the soldiers.\nDevelopments in production.\nUntil the end of the 19th century, vaccination was performed either directly with vaccine produced on the skin of calves or, particularly in England, with vaccine obtained from the calf but then maintained by arm-to-arm transfer; initially in both cases vaccine could be dried on ivory points for short-term storage or transport but increasing use was made of glass capillary tubes for this purpose towards the end of the century. During this period there were no adequate methods for assessing the safety of the vaccine and there were instances of contaminated vaccine transmitting infections such as erysipelas, tetanus, septicaemia and tuberculosis. In the case of arm-to-arm transfer there was also the risk of transmitting syphilis. Although this did occur occasionally, estimated as 750 cases in 100 million vaccinations, some critics of vaccination e.g. Charles Creighton believed that uncontaminated vaccine itself was a cause of syphilis. Smallpox vaccine was the only vaccine available during this period, and so the determined opposition to it initiated a number of vaccine controversies that spread to other vaccines and into the 21st century.\nSydney Arthur Monckton Copeman, an English Government bacteriologist interested in smallpox vaccine, investigated the effects on the bacteria in it of various treatments, including glycerine. Glycerine was sometimes used simply as a diluent by some continental vaccine producers. However, Copeman found that vaccine suspended in 50% chemically pure glycerine and stored under controlled conditions contained very few \"extraneous\" bacteria and produced satisfactory vaccinations. He later reported that glycerine killed the causative organisms of erysipelas and tuberculosis when they were added to the vaccine in \"considerable quantity\", and that his method was widely used on the continent. In 1896, Copeman was asked to supply \"extra good calf vaccine\" to vaccinate the future Edward VIII.\nVaccine produced by Copeman's method was the only type issued free to public vaccinators by the British Government Vaccine Establishment from 1899. At the same time the Vaccination Act 1898 (61 &amp; 62 Vict. c. 49) banned arm-to-arm vaccination, thus preventing transmission of syphilis by this vaccine. However, private practitioners had to purchase vaccine from commercial producers. Although proper use of glycerine reduced bacterial contamination considerably, the crude starting material, scraped from the skin of infected calves, was always heavily contaminated and no vaccine was totally free from bacteria. A survey of vaccines in 1900 found wide variations in bacterial contamination. Vaccine issued by the Government Vaccine Establishment contained 5,000 bacteria per gram, while commercial vaccines contained up to 100,000 per gram. The level of bacterial contamination remained unregulated until the Therapeutic Substances Act 1925 (15 &amp; 16 Geo. 5. c. 60) set an upper limit of 5,000 per gram, and rejected any batch of vaccine found to contain the causative organisms of erysipelas or wound infections. Unfortunately glycerolated vaccine lost its potency quickly at ambient temperatures which restricted its use in tropical climates. However, it remained in use into the 1970s when a satisfactory cold chain was available. Animals continued to be widely used by vaccine producers during the smallpox eradication campaign. A WHO survey of 59 producers, some of whom used more than one source of vaccine, found that 39 used calves, 12 used sheep and 6 used water buffalo, whilst only 3 made vaccine in cell culture and 3 in embryonated hens' eggs. English vaccine was occasionally made in sheep during World War I but from 1946 only sheep were used.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, Leslie Collier, an English microbiologist working at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine, developed a method for producing a heat-stable freeze-dried vaccine in powdered form. Collier added 0.5% phenol to the vaccine to reduce the number of bacterial contaminants but the key stage was to add 5% peptone to the liquid vaccine before it was dispensed into ampoules. This protected the virus during the freeze drying process. After drying, the ampoules were sealed under nitrogen. Like other vaccines, once reconstituted it became ineffective after 1\u20132 days at ambient temperatures. However, the dried vaccine was 100% effective when reconstituted after 6 months storage at allowing it to be transported to, and stored in, remote tropical areas. Collier's method was increasingly used and, with minor modifications, became the standard for vaccine production adopted by the WHO Smallpox Eradication Unit when it initiated its global smallpox eradication campaign in 1967, at which time 23 of 59 manufacturers were using the Lister strain.\nIn a letter about landmarks in the history of smallpox vaccine, written to and quoted from by Derrick Baxby, Donald Henderson, chief of the Smallpox Eradication Unit from 1967 to 1977 wrote; \"Copeman and Collier made an enormous contribution for which neither, in my opinion ever received due credit\".\nSmallpox vaccine was inoculated by scratches into the superficial layers of the skin, with a wide variety of instruments used to achieve this. They ranged from simple needles to multi-pointed and multi-bladed spring-operated instruments specifically designed for the purpose.\nA major contribution to smallpox vaccination was made in the 1960s by Benjamin Rubin, an American microbiologist working for Wyeth Laboratories. Based on initial tests with textile needles with the eyes cut off transversely half-way he developed the bifurcated needle. This was a sharpened two-prong fork designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried vaccine by capillarity. Easy to use with minimum training, cheap to produce ($5 per 1000), using one quarter as much vaccine as other methods, and repeatedly re-usable after flame sterilization, it was used globally in the WHO Smallpox Eradication Campaign from 1968. Rubin estimated that it was used to do 200 million vaccinations per year during the last years of the campaign. Those closely involved in the campaign were awarded the \"Order of the Bifurcated Needle\". This, a personal initiative by Donald Henderson, was a lapel badge, designed and made by his daughter, formed from the needle shaped to form an \"O\". This represented \"Target Zero\", the objective of the campaign.\nEradication of smallpox.\nSmallpox was eradicated by a massive international search for outbreaks, backed up with a vaccination program, starting in 1967. It was organised and co-ordinated by a World Health Organization (WHO) unit, set up and headed by Donald Henderson. The last case in the Americas occurred in 1971 (Brazil), south-east Asia (Indonesia) in 1972, and on the Indian subcontinent in 1975 (Bangladesh). After two years of intensive searches, what proved to be the last endemic case anywhere in the world occurred in Somalia, in October 1977. A Global Commission for the Certification of Smallpox Eradication chaired by Frank Fenner examined the evidence from, and visited where necessary, all countries where smallpox had been endemic. In December 1979 they concluded that smallpox had been eradicated; a conclusion endorsed by the WHO General Assembly in May 1980. However, even as the disease was being eradicated there still remained stocks of smallpox virus in many laboratories. Accelerated by two cases of smallpox in 1978, one fatal (Janet Parker), caused by an accidental and unexplained containment breach at a laboratory at the University of Birmingham Medical School, the WHO ensured that known stocks of smallpox virus were either destroyed or moved to safer laboratories. By 1979, only four laboratories were known to have smallpox virus. All English stocks held at St Mary's Hospital, London were transferred to more secure facilities at Porton Down and then to the US at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia in 1982, and all South African stocks were destroyed in 1983. By 1984, the only known stocks were kept at the CDC in the U.S. and the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology (VECTOR) in Koltsovo, Russia. These states report that their repositories are for possible anti-bioweaponry research and insurance if some obscure reservoir of natural smallpox is discovered in the future.\nAnti-terrorism preparation.\nAmong more than 270,000 US military service members vaccinated with smallpox vaccine between December 2002, and March 2003, eighteen cases of probable myopericarditis were reported (all in first-time vaccinees who received the NYCBOH strain of vaccinia virus), an incidence of 7.8 per 100,000 during the 30 days they were observed. All cases were in young, otherwise healthy adult white men and all survived.\nIn 2002, the United States government started a program to vaccinate 500,000 volunteer health care professionals throughout the country. Recipients were healthcare workers who would be first-line responders in the event of a bioterrorist attack. Many healthcare workers refused or did not pursue vaccination, worried about vaccine side effects, compensation and liability. Most did not see an immediate need for the vaccine. Some healthcare systems refused to participate, worried about becoming a destination for smallpox patients in the event of an epidemic. Fewer than 40,000 actually received the vaccine.\nOn 21 April 2022, Public Services and Procurement Canada published a notice of tender seeking to stockpile 500,000 doses of smallpox vaccine in order to protect against a potential accidental or intentional release of the eradicated virus. On 6 May, the contract was awarded to Bavarian Nordic for their Imvamune vaccine. These were deployed by the Public Health Agency of Canada for targeted vaccination in response to the 2022 mpox outbreak.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of the modern smallpox vaccine has long been unclear, but horsepox was identified in the 2010s as the most likely ancestor. Edward Jenner had obtained his vaccine from a cow, so he named the virus \"vaccinia\", after the Latin word for cow. Jenner believed that both cowpox and smallpox were viruses that originated in the horse and passed to the cow, and some doctors followed his reasoning by inoculating their patients directly with horsepox. The situation was further muddied when Louis Pasteur developed techniques for creating vaccines in the laboratory in the late 19th century. As medical researchers subjected viruses to serial passage, inadequate recordkeeping resulted in the creation of laboratory strains with unclear origins. By the late 19th century, it was unknown whether the vaccine originated from cowpox, horsepox, or an attenuated strain of smallpox.\nIn 1939, Allan Watt Downie showed that the vaccinia virus was serologically distinct from the \"spontaneous\" cowpox virus. This work established vaccinia and cowpox as two separate viral species. The term \"vaccinia\" now refers only to the smallpox vaccine, while cowpox no longer has a Latin name. The development of whole genome sequencing in the 1990s made it possible to compare orthopoxvirus genomes and identify their relationships with each other. The horsepox virus was sequenced in 2006 and found to be most closely related to \"vaccinia\". In a phylogenetic tree of the orthopoxviruses, horsepox forms a clade with \"vaccinia\" strains, and cowpox strains form a different clade.\nHorsepox is extinct in the wild, and the only known sample was collected in 1976. Because the sample was collected at the end of the smallpox eradication campaign, scientists considered the possibility that horsepox is a strain of \"vaccinia\" that had escaped into the wild. However, as more smallpox vaccines were sequenced, older vaccines were found to be more similar to horsepox than modern \"vaccinia\" strains. A smallpox vaccine manufactured by Mulford in 1902 is 99.7% similar to horsepox, closer than any previously known strain of \"vaccinia\". Modern Brazilian vaccines with a documented introduction date of 1887, made from material collected in an 1866 outbreak of \"cowpox\" in France, are more similar to horsepox than other strains of \"vaccinia\". Five smallpox vaccines manufactured in the United States in 1859\u20131873 are most similar to each other and horsepox, as well as the 1902 Mulford vaccine. One of the 1859\u20131873 vaccines was identified as a novel strain of horsepox, containing a complete gene from the 1976 horsepox sample that has deletions in \"vaccinia\".\nTerminology.\nThe word \"vaccine\" is derived from \"Variolae vaccinae\" (i.e. smallpox of the cow), the term devised by Jenner to denote cowpox and used in the long title of his \"An enquiry into the causes and effects of Variolae vaccinae, known by the name of cow pox\". Vaccination, the term which soon replaced \"cowpox inoculation\" and \"vaccine inoculation\", was first used in print by Jenner's friend, Richard Dunning in 1800. Initially, the terms \"vaccine\"/\"vaccination\" referred only to smallpox, but in 1881 Louis Pasteur proposed at the \"7th International Congress of Medicine\" that to honour Jenner the terms be widened to cover the new protective inoculations being introduced. According to some sources the term was first introduced by Jenner's friend Richard Dunning in 1800.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
