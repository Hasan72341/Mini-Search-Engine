{"id": "62614", "revid": "712163", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62614", "title": "Pyrrolysine", "text": "&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chembox/styles.css\"/&gt;\nChemical compound\nPyrrolysine (symbol Pyl or O), encoded by the \"amber\" stop codon UAG, is a proteinogenic amino acid that is used in some methanogenic archaea and in bacteria. It consists of lysine with a 4-methylpyrroline-5-carboxylate in amide linkage with the \u03b5N of the lysine. Its pyrroline side-chain is similar to that of lysine in being basic and positively charged at neutral pH.\nGenetics.\nNearly all genes are translated using only 20 standard amino acid building blocks. Two unusual genetically-encoded amino acids are selenocysteine and pyrrolysine. Pyrrolysine was discovered in 2002 at the active site of methyltransferase enzyme from a methane-producing archeon, \"Methanosarcina barkeri\". This amino acid is encoded by UAG (normally a stop codon), and its synthesis and incorporation into protein is mediated via the biological machinery encoded by the \"pylTSBCD\" cluster of genes.\nSynthesis.\nPyrrolysine is synthesized \"in vivo\" by joining two molecules of -lysine. One molecule of lysine is first converted to (3\"R\")-3-methyl--ornithine, which is then ligated to a second lysine. An NH2 group is eliminated, followed by cyclization and dehydration step to yield -pyrrolysine.\nCatalytic function.\nThe extra pyrroline ring is incorporated into the active site of several methyltransferases, where it is believed to rotate relatively freely. It is believed that the ring is involved in positioning and displaying the methyl group of methylamine for attack by a corrinoid cofactor. The proposed model is that a nearby carboxylic acid bearing residue, glutamate, becomes protonated, and the proton can then be transferred to the imine ring nitrogen, exposing the adjacent ring carbon to nucleophilic addition by methylamine. The positively charged nitrogen created by this interaction may then interact with the deprotonated glutamate, causing a shift in ring orientation and exposing the methyl group derived from the methylamine to the binding cleft where it can interact with corrinoid. In this way a net CH3+ is transferred to the cofactor's cobalt atom with a change of oxidation state from +1 to +3. The methylamine-derived ammonia is then released, restoring the original imine.\nGenetic coding.\nUnlike posttranslational modifications of lysine such as hydroxylysine, methyllysine, and hypusine, pyrrolysine is incorporated during translation (protein synthesis) as directed by the genetic code, just like the standard amino acids. It is encoded in mRNA by the UAG codon, which in most organisms is the 'amber' stop codon. This requires only the presence of the \"pylT\" gene, which encodes an unusual transfer RNA (tRNA) with a CUA anticodon, and the \"pylS\" gene, which encodes a class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that charges the \"pylT\"-derived tRNA with pyrrolysine.\nIt was originally proposed that a specific downstream sequence \"PYLIS\", forming a stem-loop in the mRNA, forced the incorporation of pyrrolysine instead of terminating translation in methanogenic archaea. This would be analogous to the SECIS element for selenocysteine incorporation. However, the PYLIS model has lost favor in view of the lack of structural homology between PYLIS elements and the lack of UAG stops in those species.\nUse in bioengineering.\nThe tRNA-aaRS pair for pyrrolysine (\"orthogonal pair\") is independent of other synthetases and tRNAs in most organisms including \"Escherichia coli\", and further possesses some flexibility in the range of amino acids processed (the aaRS accepts some different molecules that are structurally similar to pyrrolysine), making it an attractive tool to allow the placement of a possibly wide range of functional chemical groups at arbitrarily specified locations in modified proteins. For example, the system provided one of two fluorophores incorporated site-specifically within calmodulin to allow the real-time examination of changes within the protein by FRET spectroscopy, and site-specific introduction of a photocaged lysine derivative. \"(See Expanded genetic code)\"\nThe recognition of a tRNA by an aaRS is by its acceptor stem sequence. The pyrrolysine tRNA can be modified to have an acceptor stem of another tRNA, allowing a different aaRS to act on it. In 2024, it was reported a version modified to accept alanine can effectively suppress premature termination codons (all three of them) in human cell lines.\nEvolution.\nThe \"pylT\" (tRNA) and \"pylS\" (aa-tRNA synthase) genes are part of an operon of \"Methanosarcina barkeri\", with homologues in other sequenced members of the \"Methanosarcinaceae\" family: \"M. acetivorans\", \"M. mazei\", and \"M. thermophila\". Pyrrolysine-containing proteins are known to include monomethylamine methyltransferase (\"mtmB\"), dimethylamine methyltransferase (\"mtbB\"), and trimethylamine methyltransferase (\"mttB\"). Homologs of \"pylS\" and \"pylT\" have also been found in an Antarctic archaeon, \"Methanosarcina barkeri\" and a Gram-positive bacterium, \"Desulfitobacterium hafniense\". The other genes of the \"Pyl\" operon mediate pyrrolysine biosynthesis, leading to description of the operon as a \"natural genetic code expansion cassette\".\nA number of evolutionary scenarios have been proposed for the pyrrolysine system. The current (2022) view, given available sequences for tRNA and Pyl-tRNA (PylRS) synthase genes, is that:\nEarlier evolutionary scenarios were limited by the taxonomic range of known synthases:\nEvolution of pyrrolysine methyltransferases.\n\"MttB\", \"MtbB\", and \"MtmB\" exhibit no obvious sequence homology. Solved crystal structures of MttB and MtmB show the same TIM barrel fold. Both are also homohexamers with D3 symmetry, but the relative positions in the homohexamer are different. Most importantly, the active-site pyrrolysine residue in both point toward the center of the TIM-barrel, but are located at completely different sides of the barrel. This suggests that the use of pyrrolysine was not a feature of the shared ancestor; instead, pyrrolysine may have evolved for use in one of these enzymes and was co-opted into the other two.\n\"MttB\" is known to have several relatives without pyrrolysine in the \"MttB\" superfamily, all with high sequence similarity. Among all structures in the PDB as of 2023, the most similar (by structure and sequence identity) to \"MttB\" are the glycine betaine methyltransferase \"MtgB\" and a protein of unknown function 4YYC. \"MtmB\" is the third most similar structurally (among all PDB structures as of 2023) with a great decrease in similarity.Supp. Tbl. 3 \nA non-pyrrolysine member of the \"MtmB\" superfamily was discovered via metagenomics of a \"\"Ca.\" Formimonas warabiya\" DCMF in 2022. The only thing known about its function is that its expression is increased in the presence of dichloromethane.\nThere has been no report of any member of the \"MtbB\" superfamily without pyrrolysine in literature as of 2025.\nNon-methyltransferase function.\nThe tRNAHis guanylyltransferase gene \"Thg1\" from the archaeon \"Methanosarcina acetivorans\" has a pyrrolysine residue. The gene works as usual if the pyrrolysine is substituted for other amino acids. In this case, the presence of Pyl results from simple neutral evolution. The insertion of Pyl into a protein requires no special signal in the mRNA, only a UAG codon, so it stands to reason that the barrier for changing a residue into Pyl in a protein sequence is the same as any other amino-acid substitution.\nThe bacterium \"Acetohalobium arabaticum\" has a serine dehydratase with two Pyl residues in addition to the regular methyltransferases. It also only expresses the Pyl machinery when trimethylamine is present. This conditional expression causes the bacterium to only produce a functional version of the serine dehydratase, the methyltransferases, and potentially the rest of its many proteins coded by a gene (about 20% of all its ORFs) with an in-frame TAG when trimethylamine is present. Although the incorporation of Pyl in those non-methyltransferase genes probably have no particular catalytic function, it has been adapted into a new way to regulate the production of protein products.\nThe prevalence of ORFs with a in-frame TAG is much smaller in archaeons, as expected for their \"always-on\" (constituent) expression of the Pyl machinery, at about 5%. Still, with a great number of genomes carrying the Pyl machinery in archaea, 5% is no small number. A study of 425 archaeal genomes with a Pyl machinery found 360 cases where a TAG occurs in the middle of a predicted protein with known non-TAG homologs. Some of these may have arisen through neutral mutations like previously described for \"Thg1\" and indeed the rates are mostly consistent with random mutation. However, a few occurrences of Pyl are conserved and may reflect a new, beneficial function. In any case, the high prevalence of Pyl in some genomes, especially non-methanogenic ones, show that Pyl has become another regular piece of the genetic code in those lineages.\nPotential for an alternative translation.\nThe tRNACUA can be charged with lysine \"in vitro\" by the concerted action of the \"M. barkeri\" Class I and Class II lysyl-tRNA synthetases (LysRS1 and LysRS2), neither of which recognizes pyrrolysine. Charging a tRNACUA with lysine was originally hypothesized to be the first step in translating UAG amber codons as pyrrolysine, a mechanism analogous to that used for selenocysteine. More recent data favor direct charging of pyrrolysine on to the tRNACUA by the protein product of the \"pylS\" gene, leading to the suggestion that the LysRS1:LysRS2 complex may participate in a parallel pathway designed to ensure that proteins containing the UAG codon can be fully translated using lysine as a substitute amino acid in the event of pyrrolysine deficiency. Further study found that the genes encoding LysRS1 and LysRS2 are not required for normal growth on methanol and methylamines with normal methyltransferase levels, and they cannot replace \"pylS\" in a recombinant system for UAG amber stop codon suppression.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the stepdaughter of Emperor Napol\u00e9on I as the daughter of his first wife, Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais. Hortense later married Napol\u00e9on I's brother, Louis, making her Napoleon's sister-in-law. She became queen consort of Holland when Louis was made King of Holland in 1806. She and Louis had three sons: Napol\u00e9on-Charles Bonaparte; Napoleon III, Emperor of the French; and Louis II of Holland. She also had an illegitimate son, Charles, Duke of Morny, with her lover, the Comte de Flahaut.\nEarly life.\nHortense Eug\u00e9nie C\u00e9cile Bonaparte was born in Paris, France, on 10 April 1783. She was born as the second child and first daughter to Alexandre Fran\u00e7ois Marie, Vicomte de Beauharnais, and Jos\u00e9phine Tascher de la Pagerie. Her parents separated when she was five years old and, between the ages of five and ten, she was sent to live in Martinique. Her father was executed on 23 July 1794, at the time of the French Revolution, a few days before the end of the Reign of Terror. Her mother was imprisoned in the Carmelites\u2019 prison, from which she was released on 6 August 1794, due to the intervention of her friend Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Tallien. Two years later, her mother married Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte.\nHortense was described as having been an amusing and pretty child with long, pale golden-blonde hair and blue eyes. She received her education at the school of Madame Jeanne Campan in St-Germain-en-Laye together with Napol\u00e9on's youngest sister Caroline Bonaparte, who later married Joachim Murat. She was sent to boarding school when her mother, Josephine, decided that she did not have enough time to raise children. There, she developed a love for fine art and music. Hortense was an accomplished amateur musical composer and supplied the army of her stepfather with rousing marches, including Partant pour la Syrie. She also enjoyed playing games and excelled at billiards particularly.\nIn 1802, at Napol\u00e9on's request, Hortense married his brother Louis Bonaparte. Hortense was reluctant to marry at first, but her mother persuaded her to accept the proposal for the political wellbeing and prosperity of the family.\nQueen of Holland.\nNapol\u00e9on appointed his brother Louis as King of Holland in 1806 and Hortense accompanied her husband to The Hague. Hortense's reaction to her appointment as Queen of Holland was negative for two reasons. First, it was necessary for her to move there with Louis, with whom she did not get along. Second, she had to leave her life as a celebrated member of Parisian society. She had hoped to be \"a Queen of Holland in Paris,\" but Napol\u00e9on did not agree. She was forced to depart to the Netherlands with Louis eventually, where she arrived on 18 June 1806.\nQueen Hortense was pleasantly surprised when the Dutch public welcomed her warmly. She quickly became accustomed to life in the Netherlands and came to like the country. She attended official celebrations and ceremonies, visited the marketplaces where she made large purchases, and was much liked by the public, which annoyed her husband. She learned water-colour painting and made trips around the countryside. Nevertheless, she hated her stay there because of her relationship with King Louis. The couple lived in different parts of the palace and avoided each other at every opportunity, with Hortense describing herself as a prisoner. She also refused to give up her French citizenship and declare herself Dutch as Louis did.\nIn 1807 her first son died; she was allowed to stay in France subsequently, as the climate there was considered better for raising her other son Louis-Napol\u00e9on. She remained in France, again pleased by her status as a queen at the French court, until 1810, when Napol\u00e9on remarried to Marie Louise of Austria.\nThis forced Hortense to return to the Netherlands and reconcile with her husband. When Napoleon married Marie Louise, Hortense returned to the Netherlands temporarily, but found that the Dutch did not welcome her. She considered this the end of her marriage and left for France shortly before her husband abdicated the throne to their oldest living son, Napoleon-Louis Bonaparte, making him Louis II of Holland.\nPersonal life.\nHortense was now free to respond to the romantic overtures of the man whom she had long admired, Colonel Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, a sophisticated, handsome man, who was an illegitimate son of Talleyrand.&lt;ref name=\"Dard 1938 https://www.jstor.org/stable/44850143?read-now=1&amp;seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents 341-342\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They soon became lovers.\nIn 1811, at an unspecified inn in Switzerland, close to Lake Geneva, Hortense gave birth to a son by Comte de Flahaut secretly,\nCharles Auguste Louis Joseph ( 21 October 1811 - 10 March 1865), created Duke of Morny by his half-brother, Napol\u00e9on III, in 1862.\nOnly her brother Eug\u00e8ne, her closest companions, and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Filleul de Souza (Charles de Flahaut's mother) were aware of her pregnancy and the subsequent birth. She had used poor health to explain her prolonged visit to Switzerland, which Ad\u00e9la\u00efde arranged. Hortense disguised her pregnancy cleverly (she was, by then, in her sixth month) during the baptism of Napol\u00e9on's son, Napol\u00e9on II, when Napol\u00e9on I made her one of the child's godmothers, an honour she shared with Madame M\u00e8re, mother of the Emperor.\nIn 1814 Flahaut had an affair with the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise actress Mademoiselle Mars. When Hortense read Mars\u2019 \"passionate outpourings\" in one of her letters to Charles, she ended the affair. Although Hortense still had a deep attachment to Charles and remained in correspondence with him initially, she then made up her mind to release him. When, months later, he had mentioned that he had met \"a rich young woman who seemed to like him,\u201d Hortense begged him to forget the promises he had made to her. In October that year she went on a pilgrimage to the Benedictine shrine of Our Lady of the Hermits at Einsiedeln Abbey in the Swiss canton of Schwyz. After renouncing her claims on Charles, she presented a bouquet of diamond hydrangeas to the Virgin and a ring for the abbot, having been blessed, she wrote, with \"so many consolations, such happiness at Einsiedeln not to wish that my memory remain there after I had left.\"\nComposer.\nHortense de Beauharnais found love for music during her time in boarding school and she became a self-acclaimed amateur composer there (Beaucour, 2007). Though she did not have any known education in composition, it is said that she was a very talented singer and pianist. F\u00e9tis wrote about her in his article, Biographie Universelle des Musiciens, the following lines:\n \u201cPlantade was Queen Hortense\u2019s singing-master when she was at Mad. Campan\u2019s school; what her Majesty gained more especially from her lessons was a great capability of stint, she composed several pieces of this kind, among which is the one beginning with the words: \u2018Partant pour la Syrie.\u2019 This romance, which enjoyed a great vogue about 1810, again became popular in France after 1852.\u201d While her stepfather, Napoleon, ruled over France, she wrote marches and the French Troops sung some of her songs.\nHortense was banished when Napoleon was defeated and there she wrote numerous pieces, mostly notably her 12 Romances she wrote for her brother Eugene. Although she was banished, Hortense\u2019s home exemplified the spirit of French art culture. There she presented her arts for her many visitors. Famous contemporary artists like Franz Liszt, Alexandre Dumas, and Lord Byron came to visit and listen to her piano performances. Hortense\u2019s most famous composition \u2018Partant pour la Syrie\u2019 became the national hymn of France after her son Emperor Napoleon III instated it as such. (Last FM, 2010). French composer Camille Saint-Saens quotes \u201cPartant pour la Syrie\u201d in \u201cFossils\u201d from his Carnival of the Animals.\nA collection of some of her writing, art, and compositions can be found in her \u201cLivre d\u2019art de la reine Hortense.\u201d\nCharities.\nHortense donated to the poor often and was also known to be a favourite amongst them. She states in her memoirs, \u201cGoing to one of the mulatto houseservants I announced, \u2018John, look at all this money granny gave me for the poor black people. Take me round to their cabins so I can give it to them.\u2019\u201d\nLater years.\nAt the Bourbon Restoration in 1814, Hortense received the protection of Alexander I of Russia. At his instigation, Louis XVIII granted her the title of Duchess of Saint-Leu (duchesse de Saint-Leu) on 30 May 1814. During the Hundred Days, however, Hortense supported her stepfather and brother-in-law Napol\u00e9on. In turn, Louis XVIII banished Hortense from France after Napoleon\u2019s final defeat. She left Paris on 17 July 1815.\nDuring her banishment, Hortense began to focus on writing her memoirs, composing and publishing her musical works, drawing, and painting. Her home became a center for French art and culture. Established artists, composers, and writers were all fascinated by the banished queen in Switzerland.\nDespite residing in Switzerland, Hortense remained involved in her sons\u2019 lives. When one of her sons, Napoleon-Louis (Louis II of Holland), died in the Italian revolt against Austrian rule, she and her youngest son Louis-Napoleon escaped to France in April 1831. They reached Paris later that month, where Hortense discreetly contacted the new King of the French Louis-Philippe asking for passports so that she and her son could travel on to England. Louis-Philippe received her warmly at the Tuileries Palace and agreed to secure the passports. He told her that, for the time being, the Law of Exile against the Bonapartes would be upheld, assuring her that \"the time is not too distant that there will be no more exiles.\" According to Maxime du Camp, who had access to official dossiers, during his mothers' interview with the king, Louis-Napoleon was observed by authorities meeting with a group of conspirators who were planning to stage a coup to overthrow Louis-Philippe and bring Napoleon II to power. Hortense and her son were both implicated in the scheme. To further complicate the situation, rumor of Hortense's presence in Paris began to spread, and on 5 May a crowd of Bonapartists came to demonstrate outside her hotel on Place Vend\u00f4me, shouting \"Vive l'Empereur\". The new Orl\u00e9anist government ordered Hortense and her son to leave France the next day.\nShe traveled in Germany and Italy before she purchased the Ch\u00e2teau Arenenberg in the Swiss canton of Thurgau in 1817. She lived there until she died of cancer on 5 October 1837, at the age of fifty-four. She is buried next to her mother Jos\u00e9phine in the Saint-Pierre-Saint-Paul church in Rueil-Malmaison. After her death, her remaining legitimate son, Charles-Louis Napoleon, returned to Paris, where he became Emperor Napoleon III.\nA portrait of Hortense hangs at James Monroe\u2019s Highland, the Virginia plantation home of James Monroe, fifth President of the United States. It was one of three portraits Hortense gave to Monroe's daughter Eliza, with whom she attended school in France. (The other two portraits are of Hortense's brother Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais and of Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan, the headmistress of the school Hortense and Eliza attended.) Eliza named her daughter, Hortensia Monroe Hay, in honour of her Godmother Hortense.\nIssue.\nWith Louis Bonaparte, she had three sons:\nWith Charles Joseph, Comte de Flahaut, she had one son: \nCultural depictions.\nFilm\nTelevision\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It takes its name from a cluster of rocks off the Normandy coast. In 2019, it had a population of 694,905.\nHistory.\nCalvados is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 March 1790, in application of the law of 22 December 1789. It had been part of the former province of Normandy. The name \"Orne-Inf\u00e9rieure\" was originally proposed, but it was ultimately called Calvados after a group of rocks off its coast.\nOne popular legend ascribes its etymology to the \"Salvador\", a ship from the Spanish Armada that sank by the rocks near Arromanches-les-Bains in 1588. It is more likely, however, that the name \"Calvados\" was derived from \"calva dorsa\", meaning \"bare backs\", in reference to two sparsely vegetated rocks off its shore.\nAfter the allied victory at Waterloo the department was occupied by Prussian troops between June 1815 and November 1818.\nOn 6 June 1944, the Allied forces landed on the beaches of the Bay of the Seine in what became known as the Battle of Normandy.\nGeography.\nCalvados belongs to the region of Normandy and borders the departments of Seine-Maritime (maritime border), Eure, Orne and Manche. To the north is the Baie de la Seine, part of the English Channel. On the east, the river Seine forms the boundary with Seine-Maritime. Calvados includes the Bessin area, the Pays d'Auge and the area known as the \"Suisse normande\" (\"Norman Switzerland\").\nThe most notable places in Calvados include Deauville and the formerly elegant 19th-century casino resorts along the coast.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture dominates the economy of Calvados. The area is known for producing butter, cheese, cider, and Calvados, the apple spirit that takes its name from the area.\nPolitics.\nThe President of the Departmental Council is the centrist Jean-L\u00e9once Dupont, the former dominant figure of the right and centre in the department. The Conseil General of Calvados and Devon County Council signed a Twinning Charter in 1971 to develop links with the English county of Devon.\nDemography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe inhabitants of Calvados are called \"Calvadosiens\" (male) and \"Calvadosiennes\" (female). In 2019, Calvados had 648,299 inhabitants, making it the 34th most populated French department.\nAge distribution in Calvados (2019):\nPrincipal towns.\nThe most populous commune is Caen, the prefecture. As of 2019, there are 6 communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants:\nCulture.\nThe Bayeux Tapestry is on display in Bayeux and makes the city one of the most-visited tourist destinations in Normandy.\nJuno Beach Centre at Courseulles-sur-Mer, Calvados, commemorates the D-Day landing of the Canadian liberation forces at Juno Beach during World War II in 1944. The cult of Saint Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux brings large numbers of people on pilgrimage to Lisieux, where she lived in a Carmelite convent. Every September, Deauville hosts the Festival of the American Movie and the beach resort of Cabourg hosts the Festival of the Romantic Movie. Annually, the city of Caen celebrates the festival of the electronical cultures called \"Nordik Impakt\" and the festival of Beauregard, just around Caen.\nThe local dialect of the Norman language is known as Augeron. It is spoken by a minority of the population.\nTourism.\nCalvados is one of the most visited areas in France because of its seaside resorts which are among the most prestigious in France with their luxurious hotels, casinos, green countryside, manors, castles, the quiet, the chalk cliffs, the typical Norman houses, the history of William the Conqueror, Caen, Bayeux, Lisieux, the famous D-day beaches and numerous museums about the Second World War. Culinary specialties from the verdant countryside of Calvados are abundant: cider, calvados, camembert, and Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque cheeses.\nOne of the advantage of Calvados is to be fairly near large urban centers (Paris, Ile de France). Calvados is therefore often preferred for holidays and for weekends and sometimes considered as the \"countryside of Paris\".\nCalvados, via the port of Ouistreham, is an entrance to the continent from Britain. There are two airports: Caen-Carpiquet and Deauville-Saint Gatien. The department of Calvados has several popular tourist areas: the Bessin, the Plain of Caen, the Bocage Virois, the C\u00f4te de Nacre, the C\u00f4te Fleurie and the Pays d'Auge. Several beaches of Calvados are popular for water sports, including Cabourg and Merville-Franceville-Plage.\nTourist capacity (2022):\nSecond homes.\nAs of 2019, 17.9% of available housing in the department were second homes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Municipalities with more than 20% of second homes\nSport.\nAquatic sports are often played on the coasts and beaches, for example, kite surfing and beach volleyball.

{"id": "62626", "revid": "14604687", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62626", "title": "Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais", "text": "Empress of the French from 1804 to 1810\nJos\u00e9phine Bonaparte (, born Marie Jos\u00e8phe Rose Tascher de La Pagerie; 23 June 1763\u00a0\u2013 29 May 1814) was the first wife of Emperor Napoleon I and as such Empress of the French from 18 May 1804 until their marriage was annulled on 10 January 1810. As Napoleon's consort, she was also Queen of Italy from 26 May 1805 until the 1810 annulment. She is widely known as Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais () or Empress Jos\u00e9phine.\nJos\u00e9phine's marriage to Napoleon was her second. Her first husband, Alexandre de Beauharnais, was guillotined during the Reign of Terror, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes prison until five days after his execution. Through her children by Beauharnais, she was the grandmother of Emperor Napoleon III of France and Empress Am\u00e9lie of Brazil. Members of the current royal families of Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, and Norway and the grand ducal family of Luxembourg also descend from her. Because she did not bear Napoleon any children, he had their marriage annulled and married Marie Louise of Austria. Jos\u00e9phine was the recipient of numerous love letters written by Napoleon, many of which still exist.\nA patron of art, Jos\u00e9phine worked closely with sculptors, painters and interior decorators to establish a unique Consular and empire style at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison. She became one of the leading collectors of different forms of art of her time, such as sculpture and painting. The Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison was noted for its rose garden, which she supervised closely.\nName.\nAlthough she is often referred to as \"Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais\", it is not a name she herself used. \"Beauharnais\" is the name of her first husband, which she ceased to use upon her marriage to Napoleon, taking the last name \"Bonaparte\". She did not use the name \"Jos\u00e9phine\" before meeting Napoleon, who was the first to call her such, perhaps from her middle name, Jos\u00e8phe. Before she met Napoleon, she went by the name of Rose, or Marie-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie, later de Beauharnais. She sometimes reverted to using her maiden name in later life. After her marriage to then-General Bonaparte, she adopted the name Jos\u00e9phine Bonaparte. The misnomer \"Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais\" emerged during the restoration of the Bourbons, who were hesitant to refer to her by either Napoleon's surname or her imperial title.\nFamily background.\nThe Taschers were an ancient French noble family of landed gentry, and Jos\u00e9phine's grandfather, Gaspard-Joseph Tascher de La Pagerie (1705\u20131767) was the first to settle in Le Carbet on Martinique in 1726. He seems to have lived in poverty there, but secured a position for his son, Joseph-Gaspard Tascher de La Pagerie (5 July 1735 \u2013 7 November 1790) as a page in the household of the \"Dauphine\" of France, Maria Josepha of Saxony.\nAfter spending three years from 1752 in France, Joseph-Gaspard returned to Martinique and married on 9 November 1761 Marie Rose-Claire des Vergers de Sannois (27 August 1736 \u2013 1 June 1807), whose maternal grandfather, Anthony Brown, may have been Irish. Rose-Claire was from one of the oldest European families on the island, and the Tascher family home near Les Trois-\u00celets, a sugar plantation, which is now a museum, was part of her dowry.\nOn Martinique, Joseph-Gaspard earned his living as a plantation owner and a lieutenant of the \"Troupes de marine\", apart from a small pension for his previous work in the royal household. He was almost always close to bankruptcy and suffered from ill health.\nDisputed birthplace.\nOfficially, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe-Rose Tascher de La Pagerie was born in Les Trois-\u00celets on Martinique on 23 June 1763. However, this has been disputed by several sources. The church registry in Les Trois-\u00celets states that Jos\u00e9phine was baptised there by Emmanuel Capuchin but does not say she was born there.\nJos\u00e9phine's father owned an estate in Soufri\u00e8re District on Saint Lucia, called Malmaison, which later was also the name of her famous French residence. In 1802, Dom Daviot, parish priest in Gros Islet on Saint Lucia, wrote a letter to one of his friends, stating that \"\"it is in the vicinity of [my] parish that the wife of the first consul was born\". He asserted that he was well acquainted with Jos\u00e9phine's cousin, his parishioner.\nIn Henry H. Breen's 1844 \"The History of St. Lucia\", he stated that he had met with \"several well-informed persons\"\" who were convinced that Empress Jos\u00e9phine had been born there. Breen presented some evidence for this, including a newspaper clipping from 1831 which said that it was \"alleged\" that the de Taschers were among the first settlers of Saint Lucia, and that the future empress was born on a small estate on a hill then called La Cauzette, and later known as Morne Paix Bouche. According to this story, the family lived there until 1771, when the father went to serve as intendant of Martinique. Some people even claimed to have been among Jos\u00e9phine's playmates, and one of them said that he had been \"graciously received\" by the empress in Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison outside Paris. Breen received further confirmation from Jos\u00e9phine's enslaved nanny, Dede, who said that she nursed Jos\u00e9phine at La Cauzette. \nAccording to those who believe that Jos\u00e9phine was born on Saint Lucia, the de Tascher estate in Martinique was only a \"pied-\u00e0-terre\", occasional lodging, for when they wanted to stay with his mother-in-law. Saint Lucia switched hands between Great Britain and France fourteen times, and there were no civil registers on the island when Jos\u00e9phine was born. Saint Lucia's frequent change of ownership between Britain and France could be seen as the reason her birthplace was left out of her birth record, as it would have affected her nationality.\nRegardless of where she was born, Jos\u00e9phine was her parents' first child, and they had two more: Catherine-D\u00e9sir\u00e9e in 1764 and Marie-Fran\u00e7oise in 1766. At the ages of ten and nine, Jos\u00e9phine and Catherine-D\u00e9sir\u00e9e were sent to a boarding school in Fort-Royal, run by the B\u00e9n\u00e9dictines de la Providence. There, they learned to read, write, sing, dance, and embroider for four years. After the death of Catherine-D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, Jos\u00e9phine returned to her parents' plantation. Jos\u00e9phine's nurse was an enslaved person called Marion, whose freedom she would secure in 1807.\nFirst marriage.\nJos\u00e9phine's paternal aunt, Marie Euph\u00e9mie D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Tascher de la Pagerie (1739\u20131803), was at first the mistress, later became the second wife of a French naval officer, Fran\u00e7ois de Beauharnais, Governor of Martinique, who came from a less ancient but richer noble Beauharnais family. While living on Martinique, de Beauharnais had a son, Alexandre, by his first wife, Marie Anne Henriette Fran\u00e7oise Pyvart de Chastull\u00e9 (1722\u20131766). Soon, the parents returned to France, and left the infant with the Tascher family until 1766. When he had come of age, his father's mistress, who was also Alexandre's godmother, decided that it would be advantageous to her if he married one of her nieces. Aged seventeen, he judged fifteen-year-old Jos\u00e9phine to be too close to him in age, and thus, Catherine-D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Tascher de la Pagerie (1764\u20131777) was chosen for him. As the bride's father was impoverished and the bridegroom was to become a wealthy man upon his marriage, he asked for no dowry.\nBy the time Alexandre's father had proposed in a letter, Catherine-D\u00e9sir\u00e9e had died in 1777. Not wanting to lose the rich suitor, her father offered his youngest daughter instead, which was accepted by Alexandre. Marie-Fran\u00e7oise was not yet twelve, however, and her mother and grandmother were not willing to let her go. In the end, Jos\u00e9phine was engaged to Alexandre.\nIn October 1779, she went to France with her father. She married Alexandre on 13 December 1779, in Noisy-le-Grand. They had two children: a son, Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, and a daughter, Hortense de Beauharnais (who later married Napoleon's brother Louis Bonaparte in 1802). Jos\u00e9phine and Alexandre's marriage was not a happy one. Alexandre abandoned his family for over a year to live with a mistress and frequented brothels, leading to a court-ordered separation during which Jos\u00e9phine and the children lived at Alexandre's expense in the Pentemont Abbey. \nOn 2 March 1794, during the Reign of Terror, the Committee of Public Safety ordered the arrest of her husband. He was jailed in the Carmes Prison in Paris. Considering Jos\u00e9phine as being too close to the counter-revolutionary financial circles, the Committee ordered her arrest on 18 April 1794. A warrant of arrest was issued against her on 21 April 1794, and she was imprisoned in the Carmes Prison until 28 July. During this time, Jos\u00e9phine was only allowed to communicate with her children by their scrawls on the laundry list, which the jailers soon prohibited.\nHer husband was accused of having poorly defended Mainz in July 1793, and being considered an aristocratic suspect, was sentenced to death and guillotined with his cousin Augustin on 23 July 1794, on the \"Place de la R\u00e9volution\" (later \"Place de la Concorde\") in Paris. Jos\u00e9phine was freed five days later, thanks to the Fall of Maximilien Robespierre, which ended the Reign of Terror. On 27 July 1794 Tallien arranged the liberation of Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Cabarrus, and soon after that of Jos\u00e9phine. In June 1795, a new law allowed her to recover the possessions of Alexandre.\nMarriage to Napoleon.\nMadame de Beauharnais had affairs with several leading political figures, including Paul Barras. In 1795, she met Napoleon Bonaparte, six years her junior, and became his mistress. In a letter to her in December, he wrote, \"I awake full of you. Your image and the memory of last night's intoxicating pleasures has left no rest to my senses.\" In January 1796, Napoleon proposed to her and they were married on 9 March. On the marriage certificate, Jos\u00e9phine reduced her age by 4 years and increased Napoleon's by 18 months, making the newly-weds appear to be roughly the same age. Until meeting Bonaparte, she was known as \"Rose\", but Bonaparte preferred to call her \"Jos\u00e9phine\", the name she adopted from then on.\nThe marriage was not well received by Napoleon's family, who were shocked that he had married an older widow with two children. His mother and sisters were especially resentful of Jos\u00e9phine, as they felt clumsy and unsophisticated in her presence.\nJos\u00e9phine, left behind in Paris, in 1796 began an affair with a handsome Hussar lieutenant, Hippolyte Charles. Rumors of the affair reached Napoleon; he was infuriated, and his love for her changed entirely.\nNapoleon frequently wrote passionate letters to her from Italy, begging her to join him in Milan after he occupied the city on the 10th May 1796. Under significant pressure, Jos\u00e9phine finally agreed to travel to Italy and arrived in Milan on the 10th July 1796, and Hippolyte was part of her entourage. She stayed in Italy for the next eighteen months, based primarily in Milan and later at the nearby Ch\u00e2teau de Mombello, where she was joined by Napoleon's family. \nTwo days after the wedding, Bonaparte left Paris to lead the Army of Italy. During their separation, he sent her many love letters. In February 1797, he wrote: \"You to whom nature has given spirit, sweetness, and beauty, you who alone can move and rule my heart, you who know all too well the absolute empire you exercise over it!\" \nIn 1798, Napoleon . During this campaign, Napoleon started an affair of his own with Pauline Four\u00e8s, the wife of a junior officer, who became known as \"Napoleon's Cleopatra.\" The relationship between Jos\u00e9phine and Napoleon was never the same after this. \nIn December 1800, Jos\u00e9phine was nearly killed in the Plot of the rue Saint-Nicaise, an attempt on Napoleon's life with a bomb planted in a parked cart. On 24 December, she and Napoleon went to see a performance of Joseph Haydn's \"Creation\" at the Op\u00e9ra, accompanied by several friends and family. The party travelled in two carriages. Jos\u00e9phine was in the second, with her daughter, Hortense; her pregnant sister-in-law, Caroline Murat; and General Jean Rapp. Jos\u00e9phine had delayed the party while getting a new silk shawl draped correctly, and Napoleon went ahead in the first carriage. The bomb exploded as her carriage was passing. The bomb killed several bystanders and one of the carriage horses, and blew out the carriage's windows; Hortense was struck in the hand by flying glass. There were no other injuries and the party proceeded to the Op\u00e9ra.\nEmpress of the French.\nNapoleon was elected Emperor of the French in 1804, making Jos\u00e9phine empress. The coronation ceremony, officiated by Pope Pius VII, took place at Notre-Dame de Paris, on 2 December. Napoleon first crowned himself, then put the crown on Jos\u00e9phine's head, proclaiming her empress. This showed his rejection of the clergy as the power of Europe.\nIn her role as empress, Josephine had a court appointed to her and reinstated the offices which composed the household of the queen before the French revolution, with Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de La Rochefoucauld as \"Premi\u00e8re dame d'honneur\", \u00c9milie de Beauharnais as \"Dame d'atour\", and the wives of his own officials and generals, Jeanne Charlotte du Lucay, Madame de R\u00e9musat, Elisabeth Baude de Talhou\u00ebt, Lauriston, d'Arberg, Marie Antoinette Duch\u00e2tel, Sophie de Segur, S\u00e9ran, Colbert, Savary and Agla\u00e9 Louise Augui\u00e9 Ney, as \"Dame de Palais\".\nShortly before their coronation, there was an incident at the Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Cloud that nearly sundered the marriage between the two. Jos\u00e9phine caught Napoleon in the bedroom of her lady-in-waiting, \u00c9lisabeth de Vaudey, and Napoleon threatened to divorce her as she had not produced an heir since he felt pressured from his family to do so. Eventually, however, through the efforts of her daughter Hortense, the two were reconciled.\nWhen after a few years it became clear she could not have a child, Napoleon, while still loving Jos\u00e9phine, began to think about the possibility of an annulment. The final die was cast when Napoleon's nephew (and Jos\u00e9phine's grandson) Napol\u00e9on Charles Bonaparte, who had been declared his heir, died of croup in 1807. Once again requested per Napoleon's family, he began to create lists of eligible princesses. At dinner on 30 November 1809, he let Jos\u00e9phine know that\u2014in the interest of France\u2014he must find a wife who could produce an heir. He let Jos\u00e9phine know that this was his family's wish and that he wished it were not so. Jos\u00e9phine agreed to the divorce so the Emperor could remarry in the hope of having an heir. The divorce ceremony took place on 10 January 1810 and was a grand but solemn social occasion, and each read a statement of devotion to the other. Napoleon marked the occasion by commissioning the S\u00e8vres Egyptian Service for Jos\u00e9phine as a divorce gift.\nOn 11 March, Napoleon married Marie-Louise of Austria by proxy; the formal ceremony took place at the Louvre in April. Napoleon once remarked that despite her quick infatuation with him, \"It is a womb that I am marrying\". Even after their separation, Napoleon insisted Jos\u00e9phine retain the title of empress. \"It is my will that she retain the rank and title of empress, and especially that she never doubt my sentiments, and that she ever hold me as her best and dearest friend.\"\nLater life and death.\nDuchess of Navarre.\nAfter the annulment, Jos\u00e9phine lived at the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison, near Paris. She remained on good terms with Napoleon, who provided her with a generous annual allowance and once said that the only thing to come between them was her debts. (Jos\u00e9phine remarked privately, \"The only thing that ever came between us was my debts; certainly not his manhood.\") In April 1810, by letters patent, Napoleon created her Duchess of Navarre. Some claim Napoleon and Jos\u00e9phine were still secretly in love, though it is impossible to verify this.\nIn March 1811, Marie Louise delivered a long-awaited heir, Napoleon II, to whom Napoleon gave the title \"King of Rome\". Two years later Napoleon arranged for Jos\u00e9phine to meet the young prince \"who had cost her so many tears\".\nDeath.\nJos\u00e9phine died of pneumonia in Rueil-Malmaison on 29 May 1814, soon after walking with Emperor Alexander I of Russia in the gardens of Malmaison, where she allegedly begged to join Napoleon in exile. She was buried in the nearby church of Saint Pierre-Saint Paul in Rueil. Her daughter Hortense is interred near her.\nNapoleon learned of her death via a French journal while in exile on Elba, and stayed locked in his room for two days, refusing to see anyone. He claimed to a friend, while in exile on Saint Helena, that \"I truly loved my Jos\u00e9phine, but I did not respect her.\" Despite numerous affairs, eventual marriage annulment, and his remarriage, the Emperor's last words on his death bed at St. Helena were: \"France, the Army, the Head of the Army, Jos\u00e9phine.\" (\"\").\nDescendants.\nHortense's son, Napoleon III, became Emperor of the French. Eug\u00e8ne's son Maximilian de Beauharnais, 3rd Duke of Leuchtenberg married into the Russian Imperial family, was granted the style of Imperial Highness and founded the Russian line of the Beauharnais family, while Eugene's daughter Jos\u00e9phine married King Oscar I of Sweden, the son of Napoleon's one-time fianc\u00e9e, D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Clary. Through her, Jos\u00e9phine is a direct ancestor of the present heads of the royal houses of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden and of the grandducal house of Baden.\nA number of jewels worn by modern-day royals are said to have been worn by Jos\u00e9phine. Through the Leuchtenberg inheritance, the Norwegian royal family possesses an emerald and diamond parure that have belonged to Jos\u00e9phine. The briolette diamonds, that were inherited by her son Eug\u00e8ne, were passed through his son Maximilian's marriage to the Romanov family. They were made into a Empress Jos\u00e9phine Tiara by Fab\u00e9rge's master goldsmith August Holmstr\u00f6m in late 1880's. The Swedish royal family owns several pieces of jewelry frequently linked to Jos\u00e9phine, including the Leuchtenberg Sapphire Parure, a suite of amethyst jewels, given as wedding gift to her daughter-in-law Augusta Amalia, and the Cameo Parure, worn by Sweden's royal brides.\nAnother of Eug\u00e8ne's daughters, Am\u00e9lie of Leuchtenberg, married Emperor Pedro I of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro, and became Empress of Brazil, and they had one surviving daughter, Princess Maria Am\u00e9lia of Brazil. She was briefly engaged to Archduke Maximilian of Austria, before he became Maximilian I of Mexico, before her early death.\nPersonality and appearance.\nHer biographer Carolly Erickson wrote, \"In choosing her lovers [Jos\u00e9phine] followed her head first, then her heart\", meaning that she was adept in terms of identifying the men who were most capable of fulfilling her financial and social needs. She was aware of Napoleon's potential. Jos\u00e9phine was a renowned spendthrift and Barras may have encouraged the relationship with General Bonaparte in order to get her off his hands. Jos\u00e9phine was naturally full of kindness, generosity and charm, and was praised as an engaging hostess.\nJos\u00e9phine was described as being of average height, svelte, and shapely, with silky, long, chestnut-brown hair, hazel eyes, and a rather sallow complexion. Her nose was small and straight, and her mouth was well-formed; however, she kept it closed most of the time to hide her bad teeth. She was praised for her elegance, style, and low, \"silvery\", beautifully modulated voice.\nPatroness of roses.\nIn 1799 while Napoleon was in Egypt, Jos\u00e9phine purchased the Chateau de Malmaison. She had it landscaped in an English style, hiring landscapers and horticulturalists from Britain. These included Thomas Blaikie, a Scottish horticultural expert, another Scottish gardener, Alexander Howatson, the botanist, Ventenat, and the horticulturist, Andr\u00e9 Dupont. The rose garden was begun soon after purchase; inspired by Dupont's love of roses. Jos\u00e9phine took a personal interest in the gardens and the roses, and learned a great deal about botany and horticulture from her staff. Jos\u00e9phine wanted to collect all known roses so Napoleon ordered his warship commanders to search all seized vessels for plants to be forwarded to Malmaison.Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 was commissioned by her to paint the flowers from her gardens. \"Les Roses\" was published 1817\u201320 with 168 plates of roses; 75\u201380 of the roses grew at Malmaison. The English nursery Lee and Kennedy was a major supplier, despite Britain and France being at war, his shipments were allowed to cross blockades. Specifically, when Hume's Blush Tea-Scented China was imported to England from China, the British and French Admiralties made arrangements in 1810 for specimens to cross naval blockades for Jos\u00e9phine's garden. Sir Joseph Banks, Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, also sent her roses.\nThe general assumption is that she had about 250 roses in her garden when she died in 1814. Unfortunately the roses were not catalogued during her tenure. There may have been only 197 rose varieties in existence in 1814, according to calculations by Jules Gravereaux of Roseraie de l'Haye. There were 12 species, about 40 centifolias, mosses and damasks, 20 Bengals, and about 100 gallicas. The botanist Claude Antoine Thory, who wrote the descriptions for Redout\u00e9's paintings in \"Les Roses\", noted that Jos\u00e9phine's Bengal rose R. indica had black spots on it. She produced the first written history of the cultivation of roses, and is believed to have hosted the first rose exhibition, in 1810.\nModern hybridization of roses through artificial, controlled pollination began with Jos\u00e9phine's horticulturalist Andre Dupont. Prior to this, most new rose cultivars were spontaneous mutations or accidental, bee-induced hybrids, and appeared rarely. With controlled pollination, the appearance of new cultivars grew exponentially. Of the roughly 200 types of roses known to Jos\u00e9phine, Dupont had created 25 while in her employ. Subsequent French hybridizers created over 1000 new rose cultivars in the 30 years following Jos\u00e9phine's death. In 1910, less than 100 years after her death, there were about 8000 rose types in Gravereaux's garden. Bechtel also feels that the popularity of roses as garden plants was boosted by Jos\u00e9phine's patronage. She was a popular ruler and fashionable people copied her.\nBrenner and Scanniello call her the \"Godmother of modern rosomaniacs\" and attribute her with our modern style of vernacular cultivar names as opposed to Latinized, pseudo-scientific cultivar names. For instance, \"R. alba incarnata\" became \"Cuisse de Nymphe Emue\" in her garden. After Jos\u00e9phine's death in 1814 the house was vacant at times, the garden and house ransacked and vandalised, and the garden's remains were destroyed in a battle in 1870. \nJacques-Louis Descemet dedicated \"Imp\u00e9ratrice Jos\u00e9phine\u200a\" to her sometime before 1815. Similarly, Jean-Pierre Vibert dedicated \"https://\" in her honor in 1823. The rose 'Souvenir de la Malmaison' appeared in 1844, 30 years after her death, named in her honor by a Russian Grand Duke planting one of the first specimens in the Imperial Garden in St. Petersburg.\nArt patronage.\nEmpress Jos\u00e9phine was a great lover of all art. She was known for an interest in horticulture and loved all things artistic. She surrounded herself with creative people whose work ranged from paintings and sculpture to furniture and the architecture all around her. Jos\u00e9phine always had an interest in art but it was with her marriage to her first husband that she would gain more access to art and artists. Due to her husband's high position in society she was often able to frequent many influential people's homes and learned from the works that were in their houses. After marrying Napoleon and becoming Empress she was surrounded by the works of the time, however Jos\u00e9phine also appreciated the works of old masters. She was also drawn to artists and styles that were not widely used in her time, searching for artists that challenged the accepted standards. She visited the Salon to build relationships with contemporary artists. Jos\u00e9phine became a patron to several different artists, helping to build their careers though their connection to her. After buying the Ch\u00e2teau de Malmaison, Jos\u00e9phine had a blank canvas to showpiece her art and style and used it to create salons, galleries, a theater and her famous garden. The Malmaison and Tuileries Palace became centers for Napoleon's government but was recognized as an important place for the arts in any forms. Jos\u00e9phine's court became the leading court in Europe for the arts. She became the first French female royal collector of this scale, leading in the Consular and Empire Style.\nPaintings.\nJos\u00e9phine worked with and sought out the works of many artists throughout her lifetime. In the area of painters she mainly was a collector of paintings but she was painted by and worked with several artists such as Jacques-Louis David and Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard. However, there was one painter whom Jos\u00e9phine favored and commissioned more often than others, Antoine-Jean Gros. Gros, upon hearing that Jos\u00e9phine would be visiting Genoa, worked to get an introduction knowing that the association with Jos\u00e9phine would help him become more well-known.\nUpon meeting with Gros and seeing his work, Jos\u00e9phine asked him to come back to Milan with her and to live in her residences. Jos\u00e9phine then commissioned him to create a portrait of her husband, the then General Bonaparte. The work took several sittings between Gros and Napoleon and would be named \"Bonaparte at the Pont d'Arcole\". This painting would become a big part of Napoleon's propaganda and iconography. Gros would go on to paint other portraits of Napoleon, which always portrayed him as a fierce conqueror, propagating the image of Napoleon as powerful and unstoppable. Jos\u00e9phine as a supporter and patron of Gros, aided him in becoming a central conduit for the message that the government was trying to disseminate about the rule of the Emperor in that time.\nSculpture.\nOver her lifetime Jos\u00e9phine commissioned four major pieces from the Italian Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova. The Empress was given a copy of Canova's work \"Cupid and Psyche\", which was originally promised to Colonel John Campbell, but because of unforeseen circumstances it was gifted to Jos\u00e9phine. She would commission Canova to create a sculpture and the result would be \"Dancer with Hands on Hips\". The work was commissioned in 1802 but was not finished until 1812, Jos\u00e9phine allowed him to create on his own terms, which were based on the classics but with a more relaxed and joyful appearance. He would create several sculptures based on dancing. \"Dancer with Hands on Hips\" was praised by the art community because it was not based on any specific ancient sculpture, but with a classical style, making it a completely original sculpture.\nJos\u00e9phine would commission Canova again for another sculpture called \"Paris\". The work's plaster cast was completed in 1807 but the marble statue was not finished until 1812. arriving in Malmaison in 1813 a year before Jos\u00e9phine's death. The final sculpture that the Empress would commission was \"The Three Graces\". This work would not be completed until after Jos\u00e9phine's death in 1816. All four works were eventually sold to Tsar Alexander of Russia.\nFurniture/Design.\nThe architects Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine essentially became the decorators for Jos\u00e9phine and Napoleon. Many of Jos\u00e9phine's most well-known furnishings were created especially for her by Percier and Fontaine. The two architects worked within many of the empire's residences, creating spaces for the Empress to feel at home in. Percier and Fontaine had their own unique style and created pieces for both the Emperor and his Empress, which can be easily identified as their work, even when they were not stamped as created by Percier or Fontaine. Percier and Fontaine are known for their use of cheval glass and the use of a feminine, softer feel for the pieces used in the boudoir of the Empress. These pieces were unique for the time and appreciated for their creativity. The architects Percier and Fontaine are connected to the Empire style associated with the time period.\nIn popular culture.\nStatue.\nIn 1859, French Emperor Napoleon III commissioned a statue of Jos\u00e9phine, which was installed in the La Savane park in downtown Fort-de-France. In 1991, the statue was symbolically decapitated and spattered with red paint. The acts of vandalism were done on the belief that Jos\u00e9phine had influenced her husband to issue the Law of 20 May 1802, which reinstated slavery in the French colonial empire (including Martinique). The statue was never repaired by the city administration, and every year more red paint was added to it. In July 2020, the statue was torn down and destroyed by rioters in the wake of the George Floyd protests.\nFilm.\nIn Ridley Scott's 2023 film \"Napoleon\", Jos\u00e9phine is portrayed by English actress Vanessa Kirby.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Through the second marriage of his mother, Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, he was the stepson of Napoleon Bonaparte. Under the French Empire, he also became Napoleon's adopted son (but not the heir to the imperial throne). He was Viceroy of the Kingdom of Italy under his stepfather, from 1805 to 1814, and commanded the Army of Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. Historians consider him one of Napoleon's most able relatives.\nFamily.\nEug\u00e8ne Rose de Beauharnais was born in Paris on 3 September 1781 as the son of Viscount Alexandre de Beauharnais and Marie-Jos\u00e8phe Rose Tascher de la Pagerie (future empress Josephine), both born in the French colony of Martinique. His parents separated when Eug\u00e8ne was three years old. At the age of five, Eug\u00e8ne was entrusted to his father's care and attended various boarding schools. His father served as a general during the early Revolutionary Wars. After losing the Siege of Mainz, he was imprisoned and executed by guillotine on 23 July 1794, a few days before the fall of Maximilien Robespierre and the end of the Reign of Terror.\nEarly career.\nEug\u00e8ne joined the French Revolutionary Army soon after his father's death and his mother's release from prison, initially serving as an orderly to General Lazare Hoche during the War in the Vend\u00e9e. He returned to Paris on his mother's request \"some time before the battle of Quiberon\", according to his memoirs, and was sent back to school in order to complete his education. Neither he nor his sister Hortense was present when their mother married Napoleon Bonaparte. \nAfter joining the 1st Hussar Regiment as an assistant sub-lieutenant on 30 June 1797, Eug\u00e8ne served as an aide-de-camp to his stepfather in the Italian campaign. After the Treaty of Campo Formio (17 October 1797) he was sent on missions to the Ionian Islands and Rome. In 1798, he followed Napoleon in his campaign in Egypt and Syria, where he took part in the Siege of Jaffa and was wounded during the Siege of Acre.\nEug\u00e8ne returned to France with Napoleon in the autumn of 1799, helping to bring about the reconciliation of the general and his mother, who had become estranged due to their mutual extramarital affairs. During the Coup of 18 Brumaire, he accompanied Napoleon to Saint-Cloud, where they brought the Council of Five Hundred into submission. When Napoleon became First Consul following the coup, Eug\u00e8ne was appointed captain of the \"chasseurs \u00e0 cheval\" of the Consular Guard. He distinguished himself in the Guard's cavalry charges at Battle of Marengo, and was promoted to \"chef d'escadron\". In 1803 he bought H\u00f4tel Beauharnais.\nAfter rising through the ranks under the Consulate, Eug\u00e8ne was promoted to brigade general soon after the establishment of the Empire in 1804. By a decree of 1 February 1805, Eug\u00e8ne was created Arch-Chancellor of State and made a prince of France.\nViceroy of Italy.\nAs commander of the Imperial Guard (successor to the Consular Guard), Eug\u00e8ne preceded his stepfather to Milan ahead of Napoleon's coronation as King of Italy on 26 May 1805. Napoleon had initially intended to place his brother Joseph on the Italian throne and then, after Joseph's refusal, his nephew Napol\u00e9on Charles, the son of Louis Bonaparte and Eug\u00e8ne's sister, Hortense. However, both Joseph and Louis refused, so Napoleon placed the Iron Crown upon his own head instead. During the coronation, Napoleon handed the royal ring and mantle to his stepson and on 7 June 1805 announced Eug\u00e8ne's appointment as Viceroy of Italy to the Italian Legislative Assembly.\nIn 1805, the War of the Third Coalition was to test Eug\u00e8ne's talents as an organizer, if not as a commander. While General Andr\u00e9 Mass\u00e9na commanded the Army of Italy, Eug\u00e8ne raised a reserve army to guard the kingdom's southern border, after Naples broke its neutrality agreement with France. After the French victory at Austerlitz, Napoleon sought to strengthen Bavaria's alliance with France and arranged Eug\u00e8ne's marriage to Princess Augusta of Bavaria, daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, breaking her engagement to Charles, Hereditary Prince of Baden. On 12 January 1806, Eug\u00e8ne was officially adopted by Napoleon. Though excluded from succession to the French Empire, on 16 February 1806, he was declared heir presumptive to the Italian throne, in the absence of a second son of Napoleon.\nOver the following years, Eug\u00e8ne dedicated himself to the management of the Kingdom of Italy, showing himself to be an astute politician and administrator. He oversaw military works (fortification of Mantua, expansion of the Rocca d'Anfo), public works (construction of roads, restoration of the Venetian Arsenal, draining of the marshes around Verona), and the promulgation of the Napoleonic civil, commercial, and penal codes. After the kingdom annexed the Marches from the dissolved Papal States, in April 1808, Eug\u00e8ne managed to keep relations with the Holy See from breaking down and rallied the populations of the annexed areas through economic benefits.\nDuring the War of the Fifth Coalition, Eug\u00e8ne was put in command of the Army of Italy with some highly competent generals like Grenier, Charpentier, and the future marshal \u00c9tienne MacDonald accompanying him as advisers and officers. In April 1809, he fought and lost the Battle of Sacile against the Austrian army of Archduke John, but Eug\u00e8ne's troops won the rematch at the Battle of the Piave in May and the Battle of Raab in June. After the Battle of Aspern-Essling, Napoleon recalled the Army of Italy to Austria. After joining the main army on the island of Lobau in the Danube, Eug\u00e8ne took part in the Battle of Wagram.\nNapoleon considered making Eug\u00e8ne regent of France during the invasion of Russia but ultimately decided against this. During the campaign, Eug\u00e8ne again commanded the Army of Italy (IV Corps), with a total force of 80,000 men. He fought at the battles of Ostrovno, Vitebsk, Smolensk, Borodino, Maloyaroslavets, Krasnoi, and the Berezina. After Napoleon and then Joachim Murat had left the retreating army in December 1812, Eug\u00e8ne took command of the remnants of the \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\" at Pozna\u0144. He led the retreat to Leipzig from January to May 1813, then served under Napoleon at the Battle of L\u00fctzen. Eug\u00e8ne then returned to Italy, where he set about reorganizing his troops and preparing the defence against the Austrian Empire.\nDespite the defection of Murat's Kingdom of Naples in January 1814, and pressure from his Bavarian father-in-law, Eug\u00e8ne refused to defect to the Coalition, while also rejecting calls to leave behind his kingdom and join Napoleon in the defence of France. During the Italian Campaign of 1813-1814, he commanded a series of engagements in the Po Valley in order to slow down the enemy advance, which were in effect a series of organized retreats up to the river Adige. Despite some success against the Austrians at the Battle of the Mincio River on 8 February 1814, and successive victories against the Neapolitan Army, he was beaten at the rivers Taro and Nure. On 16 April, five days after Napoleon's abdication of both the French and Italian thrones, Eug\u00e8ne signed the Convention of Schiarino-Rizzino with the Austrian commander Heinrich von Bellegarde, bringing an end to hostilities. His attempt to be crowned King of Italy failed after an insurrection in Milan on 20 April, and Eug\u00e8ne finally relinquished control of the kingdom in the Convention of Mantua on 23 April.\nLater life.\nAfter the fall of the Kingdom of Italy, Eug\u00e8ne retired to Munich in June 1814 at the behest of his father-in-law. He soon returned to Paris on the death of his mother, where he was honourably received by Louis XVIII and Alexander I of Russia. He immediately renounced his political activity and returned to his wife's family in Bavaria. Accordingly, he remained neutral during Napoleon's return to power in the Hundred Days.\nAs Duke of Leuchtenberg, Eug\u00e8ne lived his last years in Munich, managing his estates and expanding his art collection. At the same time, he provided assistance for proscripts under the Bourbon Restoration, such as Antoine Marie Chamans de Lavalette, and lobbied for the alleviation of the harsh treatment imposed on Napoleon in his captivity in Saint-Helena. In 1822, Eug\u00e8ne's health began to deteriorate. After suffering two attacks of apoplexy in 1823, he died on 21 February 1824 in Munich, aged 42.\nMarriage and issue.\nOn 14 January 1806, two days after his adoption by Napoleon, Eug\u00e8ne married Princess Augusta Amalia Ludovika Georgia of Bavaria (1788\u20131851), eldest daughter of Napoleon's ally, King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria. Although a diplomatic marriage, this union would turn out to be a happy one. On 14 November 1817, his father-in-law made him Duke of Leuchtenberg and Prince of Eichst\u00e4tt, with the style \"Royal Highness\".\nEug\u00e8ne and Augusta had seven children:\nRoles and titles.\nOn 20 December 1807, he was given the title of \"Prince de Venise\" (\"Prince of Venice\"), a title created on 30 March 1806, when the Venetian Province taken from Austria in 1805 was united to Bonaparte's Kingdom of Italy.\nIn 1810, Napoleon used his influence over Karl von Dalberg, the Archbishop of Regensburg and Grand Duke of Frankfurt, to name Eug\u00e8ne as the constitutional heir to the grand duchy. Von Dalberg abdicated on 26 October 1813 due to Frankfurt's imminent conquest by the allied armies, and Eug\u00e8ne became nominal grand duke until Frankfurt was occupied by the allies in December of that same year.\nA further imperial sinecure was \"Archichancelier d'\u00c9tat de l'Empire de France\" (\"Archchancellor of State of the Empire of France\").\nHis name is inscribed on Column 24 of the Southern Pillar of the Arc du Triomphe, reading .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The buildings house the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e, the museum of the Army of France, the Mus\u00e9e des Plans-Reliefs, and the Mus\u00e9e d'Histoire Contemporaine. The complex also includes the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, the national cathedral of the French military. It is adjacent to the Royal Chapel known as the , the tallest church building in Paris at a height of . The latter has been converted into a shrine to some of France's leading military figures, most notably the tomb of Napoleon.\nHistory.\nLouis XIV initiated the project by an order dated 24 November 1670 to create a home and hospital for aged and disabled () soldiers, the veterans of his many military campaigns. The initial architect of was Lib\u00e9ral Bruant. The selected site was in the then suburban plain of Grenelle (\"plaine de Grenelle\"). By the time the enlarged project was completed in 1676, the fa\u00e7ade fronting the Seine measured in width, and the complex had fifteen courtyards, the largest being the cour d'honneur designed for military parades. The church-and-chapel complex of the Invalides was designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart in 1676, taking inspiration from his great-uncle Fran\u00e7ois Mansart's design for a Chapelle des Bourbons to be built behind the chancel of the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the French monarch's necropolis since ancient times. Several projects were submitted in the mid-1660s by both Mansart and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, who was residing in Paris at the time. Mansart's second project is very close to Hardouin-Mansart's concept of the Royal Chapel or Dome Church at , both in terms of its architecture and of its relationship with the adjacent church. Architectural historian Allan Braham has hypothesized that the domed chapel was initially intended to be a new burial place for the Bourbon Dynasty, but that project was not implemented. Instead, the massive building was designated as the private chapel of the monarch, which was attached to the Cathedral attended by the veterans. The D\u00f4me des Invalides remains as one of the prime exemplars of French Baroque architecture, at high, and also as an iconic symbol of France's absolute monarchy.\nThe interior of the dome was painted by Le Brun's disciple Charles de La Fosse with a Baroque illusionistic ceiling painting. The painting was completed in 1705.\nMeanwhile, Hardouin-Mansart assisted the aged Bruant with the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, Paris, which was finished to Bruant's design after the latter died in 1697. Daily attendance of the veterans in the church services was required. Shortly after the veterans' chapel was started, Louis XIV commissioned Mansart to construct a separate private royal chapel, now named its most striking feature. The Dome chapel was finished in 1706.\nBecause of its location and significance, the Invalides served as the scene for several key events in French history. On 14 July 1789, it was stormed by Parisian rioters who seized the cannons and muskets stored in its cellars to use against the Bastille later the same day. Napoleon was entombed under the Dome of the Invalides with a grand ceremony in 1840. The separation between the two churches was reinforced in the 19th century with the erection of Napoleon's tomb, the creation of the two separate altars, and the construction of a glass wall between the two chapels.\nThe building retained its primary function as a retirement home and hospital for military veterans (\"invalides\") until the early twentieth century. In 1872, the mus\u00e9e d'artillerie (Artillery Museum) was located within the building to be joined by the mus\u00e9e historique des arm\u00e9es (Historical Museum of the Armies) in 1896. The two institutions were merged to form the present mus\u00e9e de l'arm\u00e9e in 1905. At the same time, the veterans in residence were dispersed to smaller centres outside Paris. The reason was that adopting a mainly conscript army after 1872 meant a substantial reduction in the number of veterans having the twenty or more years of military service formerly required to enter the H\u00f4pital des Invalides. The building accordingly became too large for its original purpose. The modern complex does, however, still include the facilities detailed below for about a hundred elderly or incapacitated former soldiers.\nWhen the Army Museum at was founded in 1905, the veterans' chapel was placed under its administrative control. It is now the cathedral of the Diocese of the French Armed Forces, officially known as Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides.\n2024 Olympic venue.\nThe Esplanade des Invalides, the expansive green space in front of the historic H\u00f4tel des Invalides, was a key venue for multiple sports during the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics. It hosted archery, para-archery, road cycling, and marathon events, with the Invalides buildings providing a unique backdrop for athletes to compete.\nArchitecture.\nNorth Front and entrance.\nHardouin-Mansart's Dome chapel is large enough to dominate the long fa\u00e7ade yet harmonizes with Bruant's door under an arched pediment on the north front of Les Invalides. To the north, the courtyard (cour d'honneur) is extended by a wide public esplanade (\"Esplanade des Invalides\") where the embassies of Austria and Finland are neighbors of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all forming one of the grand open spaces in the heart of Paris. At its far end, the Pont Alexandre III links this grand urbanistic axis with the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais. The Pont des Invalides is next, downstream the Seine river.\nThe Dome des Invalides.\nThe Dome is the tallest and most famous of the buildings of Les Invalides. Designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, it takes the form of a Greek cross, on a square plan. Each of the facades is composed of two orders superimposed. The porch is topped by triangular fronton. It is crowned by a dome 90 metres, high, surmounted by lantern bringing the height to 107 metres (351 feet), making it taller than Notre Dame de Paris and the tallest of all Paris church domes.\nThe dome is actually composed of two domes superimposed. The lower dome is largely open at the base, allowed the visitors below to see the art painted on the dome above by Charles de La Fosse. The windows are masked by the lower dome, which permits natural lighting and gives the impression that viewers are actually seeing the sky, a popular Baroque affect.\nThe interior of the dome is divided into two separate churches; beneath the dome is the chapel that was used, on rare occasions, by the royal family. Attached to the dome is a separate church, the Cathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides, Paris, which was used by the veterans who lived at Les Invalides. They were required to attend daily services in the church.\nThe painting inside the dome by Charles de la Fosse depicts Saint Louis presenting his sword to Christ and the angels. In the centre of the composition, God and the Virgin are surrounded by angel musicians. Saint Louis carries the symbols of royalty; a crown, a garden with flour-des-lys emblems, and a royal mantle. To the right of Christ are placed the symbols of the passion and the suffering of Christ; the cross, nails, a lance, and the crown of thorns.\nCharles de la Fosse (1636-1716), a student of Le Brun, was one of the leading painters of the Academy, whose work is also found in the Palace of Versailles. Jules Hardouin Mansard, in charge of all the decoration of the dome, asked La Fosse to decorate the cupola and the pendentives with paintings of the four Evangelists. In the same period, he decorated the salons of Diane and Apollo at the Palace of Versailles.\nTomb of Napoleon.\nThe Tomb of Napoleon is found within the Church of the Dome. It was created after his remains were returned to France from Saint Helena in 1840. It was prepared by King Louis Philippe I and his Prime Minister, Adolphe Thiers, but it was not completed and inaugurated until\n1861. The chief architect was Louis Visconti, who died before the tomb was completed. The sarcophagus made of purple quartzite, on a base of green granite, is placed in an open crypt, The crypt is surrounded by a circular gallery supported by twelve pillars, with relief panel and sculpture celebrating Napoleon's accomplishments, represented by figures of Atlantes. (See also Napoleon's tomb)\nCathedral of Saint-Louis-des-Invalides.\nIn 1957, the position of vicar was created to oversee the spiritual education of the army. In 1986 a position of the Bishop of the armies was established and placed at the church, which gave the church the title of cathedral.\nThe church is located directly behind the Dome des Invalides. It was originally the church that was used by the army veterans who lived at Les Invalides. They were required to attend daily services in the cathedral. In the original church, the dome, where the royal family worshipped, served as the choir, while the present cathedral was the nave for the veterans.\nOne unusual feature of the church is the display of captured enemy flags taken over the years by the French Army.\nThe cathedral has a particularly fine organ, made between 1679 and 1687, with a vert elaborate case with sculpture designed by architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart.\nThe Courtyard of Honour.\nThe organ of the cathedral is particularly notable. It was made by the organ-builder of the King, Alexandre Thierry, between 1679 and 1687, and has undergone several restorations. The elaborate buffet with sculpture was made in 1683. It was specially designed for the church by the architect, Jules Hardouin-Mansart.\nThe French Army Museum.\nThe Army Museum (Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e) was created in 1905 with the merger of the Mus\u00e9e d'Artillerie and the Mus\u00e9e Historique de l'Arm\u00e9e. The museum's seven main spaces and departments contain collections that display military equipment span the from the Middle antiquity through the 20th century.\nThe Museum of Relief Maps.\nThe Musee des Plans-Reliefs displays a collection of military models. It was begun in 1668 the Minister of War of Louis XIV ordered that three-dimensional models be made of fortified cities and strategic places in France. The models were originally held in the Louvre. The collection was enlarged through the 18th centuries, and some models of German fortifications were added. \nThe total collection made between 1668 and 1870 has about 150 models. The museum currently displays some twenty-eight models, depicting fortified cities of the French coast.\nPlan of Les Invalides.\nHardouin-Mansart's Dome chapel is large enough to dominate the long fa\u00e7ade yet harmonizes with Bruant's door under an arched pediment on the north front of Les Invalides. To the north, the courtyard (cour d'honneur) is extended by a wide public esplanade (\"Esplanade des Invalides\") where the embassies of Austria and Finland are neighbors of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all forming one of the grand open spaces in the heart of Paris. At its far end, the Pont Alexandre III links this grand urbanistic axis with the Petit Palais and the Grand Palais. The Pont des Invalides is next, downstream the Seine river.\nThe buildings still comprise the Institution Nationale des Invalides, a national institution for disabled war veterans. The institution comprises:\nBurials.\nThe Dome chapel became a military necropolis when Napoleon in September 1800 designated it for the relocation of the tomb of Louis XIV's celebrated general Turenne, followed in 1807\u20131808 by Vauban. In 1835, the underground gallery below the church received the remains of 14 victims of the Giuseppe Marco Fieschi's failed assassination attempt on Louis-Philippe I. The significant development came with the building's designation to become Napoleon's tomb by a law of 10 June 1840, as part of the political project of the orchestrated by king Louis-Philippe I and his minister Adolphe Thiers (the reference to Napoleon's or \"ashes\" is actually to his mortal remains, as he had not been cremated). The creation of the crypt and of Napoleon's massive sarcophagus took twenty years to complete and was finished in 1861. By then, it was emperor Napoleon III who was in power and oversaw the ceremony of the transfer of the remains of his uncle from a chapel of the church to the crypt beneath the dome.\nInside the \"\u00c9glise du D\u00f4me des Invalides\".\nThe most notable tomb at Les Invalides is that of Napoleon Bonaparte (1769\u20131821), designed by Louis Visconti with sculptures by James Pradier, Pierre-Charles Simart and Francisque Joseph Duret. Napoleon was initially interred on Saint Helena, but King Louis Philippe arranged for his remains to be brought to France in 1840, an event known as \"le retour des cendres\". Napoleon's remains were kept in the Saint Jerome (southwestern) chapel of the Dome church for more than two decades until his final resting place, a tomb made of red quartzite and resting on a green granite base, was finished in 1861.\nOther military figures and members of Napoleon's family were also buried at the Dome church by year of burial there:\nBeneath the \"Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides\".\n82 additional military figures, including 28 Governors of Les Invalides, are buried in the , an underground gallery beneath the Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Louis-des-Invalides:\nTwo of these, Gabriel Malleterre and Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque, are also honored with a plaque inside the Saint-Louis-des-Invalides cathedral. Another plaque honors Jean de Lattre de Tassigny (1889\u20131952), posthumous Marshal of France, commander of the French First Army during World War II and later commander in the First Indochina War, who is buried in Mouilleron-en-Pareds.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". Her lair lies in Cirith Ungol (\"the pass of the spider\") leading into Mordor. The creature Gollum deliberately leads the Hobbit protagonist Frodo there in hopes of recovering the One Ring by letting Shelob attack Frodo. The plan is foiled when Samwise Gamgee temporarily blinds Shelob with the Phial of Galadriel, and then severely wounds her with Frodo's Elvish sword, Sting.\nSome scholars have stated that Shelob is in the literary tradition of female monsters. Others have interpreted her as symbolising a sexual threat, with multiple sexual allusions. Scholars have noted her opposition to the Elves, and in particular her adversary, Galadriel, whose light helps the hobbits to defeat her darkness.\nShelob's physical appearance in Peter Jackson's film trilogy was based on the New Zealand tunnel-web spider.\nFictional history.\nShelob is described in \"The Two Towers\" as an \"evil thing in spider-form...[the] last child of Ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world\", living high in the Ephel D\u00faath mountains on the borders of Mordor. Although she resided in Mordor and was unrepentantly evil, she was independent of Sauron and his influence. Her exact size is not stated, but she is significantly larger than her descendants, the Great Spiders of Mirkwood, and her hobbit opponents. She has a powerful bite to inject her venom and paralyse or kill her victims. Her hide is tough enough to resist sword-strokes, and the strings of her webs are likewise resilient to ordinary blades, though the magical Sting manages to cut them. Her main weak point is her eyes, which can be easily harmed or blinded.\nShe is introduced as both evil and ancient: \"But still she was there, who was there before Sauron, and before the first stone of Barad-d\u00fbr; and she served none but herself, drinking the blood of Elves and Men, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness\". Her descendants include the Giant Spiders of Mirkwood defeated by Bilbo Baggins in \"The Hobbit\".\nShelob's lair was Torech Ungol, below Cirith Ungol (\"Pass of the Spider\"), along the path that the Hobbits Frodo Baggins and Sam Gamgee took into Mordor, where Shelob had encountered Gollum during his previous trip to Mordor, and he apparently worshipped her. The Orcs of the Tower of Cirith Ungol called her \"Shelob the Great\" and \"Her Ladyship\", and referred to Gollum as \"Her Sneak\". Sauron was aware of her existence, but left her alone as a useful guard on the pass, and occasionally fed prisoners to her. In the story, Gollum deliberately led Frodo and Sam into her lair, planning to recover the One Ring once she had consumed the hobbits. She cornered them; but Frodo used the Phial of Galadriel's light to drive her off, and used Sting to cut the webs blocking the tunnel. Gollum waylaid the pair and tried to strangle Sam, while Shelob paralysed Frodo; but Sam fought off Gollum and then wielded Sting against Shelob. Seeking to crush Sam, she instead impaled herself upon Sting; and, being evil, was nearly blinded by the Phial of Galadriel, containing pure light from the Silmarils; whereupon she fled. Her eventual fate, Tolkien mentions in passing, \"this tale does not tell.\" Thinking Frodo dead, Sam took the Ring from his friend and left his body behind in a bid to finish the quest himself, but discovered by listening to a pair of Orcs that Frodo was alive but senseless, under a minor influence of venom.\nName.\nAs Tolkien admitted in a letter to his son, Shelob \"is of course only 'she + lob'\", \"lob\" being an archaic English word for spider, influenced by Old English \"loppe\" or \"spider\". The word is not related to \"cob\" nor \"cobweb\". Old English \"attercoppe\" (meaning \"spider\") is derived from \"atter\" meaning \"poison\" and \"coppe\" meaning \"head\". Tolkien used \"attercop\" as well as \"cob\" and \"lob\" in \"The Hobbit\", where Bilbo Baggins sings songs taunting the giant spiders in Mirkwood: \"Attercop, Attercop, Old Tomnoddy\" and \"Lazy Lob and Crazy Cob\".\nAnalysis.\nDarkness opposed to the light.\nThe critic Joyce Tally Lionarons writes that Tolkien constructs the Elves and the spiders such as Shelob as polar opposites, the Elves good and bright, the spiders evil and dark. Milbank writes more specifically that the ancient Shelob's adversary is another ancient female character, the elf-queen Galadriel. Galadriel both chooses not to be \"\" by rejecting Frodo's offer of the One Ring, and gives Frodo her light (the Phial of Galadriel) which enables the hobbits to defeat Shelob.\nPatrick Grant, a scholar of Renaissance literature, saw Shelob and Galadriel's character pairing, one of several such relationships between characters in the novel, as fitting the opposition of Jungian archetypes. Frodo's anima is the Elf-queen Galadriel, who is opposed by the evil giant female spider Shelob. Frodo's Shadow is the male Hobbit Gollum. All of these, along with oppositions between other characters in the story, create an image of the self.\nInsatiable evil.\nJane Chance compares Shelob with the wizard Saruman, stating that both are \"monsters\" that live in \"towers\"; they have similarly structured books in \"Lord of the Rings\", one ending in a military attack on Saruman's tower, Orthanc; the other, in the hobbits' venturing into Shelob's lair in Cirith Ungol. On the other hand, she writes, while Saruman's evil is in his mind, Shelob's is in her body.\nChance stresses Shelob's \"gluttony\", one of the traditional seven deadly sins, consisting of an \"insatiable appetite\"; her laziness, since the Orcs bring her food; and her \"lechery\" with many bastard offspring. Chance compares Shelob with the guardian of the gateway to Hell, noting that in John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Satan mated with his daughter, Sin, their offspring being Death, constantly lustful for his mother: but Tolkien in one place describes Shelob as Sauron's cat rather than his daughter. The scholar of literature George H. Thomson similarly compares Shelob to Milton's Sin and Death, noting that they \"serve neither God nor Satan but look solely to their own interests\", as Shelob does; she is \"the Death and Chaos that would overcome all\".\nSexual monster.\nThe Tolkien scholar Carol Leibiger writes that Shelob is presented as a disgusting female monster in the story. The Anglican priest and scholar of religion Alison Milbank adds that Shelob is undeniably sexual: \"Tolkien offers a most convincing Freudian \"vagina dentata\" (toothed vagina) in the ancient and disgustingly gustatory spider Shelob.\" Milbank states that Shelob symbolises \"an ancient maternal power that swallows up masculine identity and autonomy\", threatening a \"castrating hold [which] is precisely what the sexual fetishist fears, and seeks to control\". The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance mentions \"Sam's penetration of her belly with his sword\", noting that this may be an appropriate and symbolic way of ending her production of \"bastards\".\nThe scholar of children's literature Zo\u00eb Jaques writes that Shelob is the \"embodiment of monstrous maternity\"; Sam's battle with Shelob could be interpreted as a \"masculine rite of passage\" where a smaller, weaker male penetrates and escapes the vast female body and her malicious intent. The Tolkien scholar Brenda Partridge described the hobbits' protracted struggle with Shelob as rife with sexual symbolism. She writes that Tolkien derived Shelob from multiple myths: Sigurd killing Fafnir the dragon; Theseus killing the Minotaur; Arachne and the spider; and Milton's Sin in \"Paradise Lost\". The result is to depict the woman as a threat, with implicit overtones of sexuality.\nNot all commentators have agreed with the sexual associations detected by scholars such as Partridge. The Tolkien scholar Daniel Timmons wrote in \"Mythlore\" in 2001: \"The obsession of reading the Shelob episode as a sexually violent encounter, rather than as an archetypal struggle between human and monster, likely reveals more about the decadent social attitudes of the critics, rather than those of Tolkien\". Timmons accepted the possibility of a \"subtext of the fear of female sexual appeal\", and agreed that the text might \"function in the literary tradition of clashes between man and female monsters, with the attendant sexual innuendos\", but called it \"disingenuous or perverse\" to assert that this was the \"main or dominant impression\".\nAdaptations.\nIn the 1981 BBC Radio adaption of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Shelob is portrayed by BBC Radiophonic Workshop member Jenny Lee.\nIn Peter Jackson's film trilogy, Shelob's appearance is delayed until the third movie, \"\". Her design is based on the New Zealand tunnel-web spider, which Jackson hates.\nShelob is a major character in the video game \"\", where she serves as both the narrator and an ally to player character Talion. In the game, Shelob shape-shifts to assume the form of an attractive woman. Following criticism of this decision, the creative director Michael de Plater explained that Gollum and Shelob were \"the unsung heroes of \"The Lord of the Rings\"\": Shelob senses Frodo's weakness and makes a pact with Gollum to hasten him to Mount Doom and destroy the ring. De Plater envisioned Shelob as a dark counterpart to Galadriel, noting how both manipulate lesser beings, but that Shelob is more honest.\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It has gained historical attention as one of the most documented instances of German war crimes during World War II, particularly given the deliberate killing of children.\nIn reprisal for the assassination of Reich Protector Heydrich in the late spring of 1942, all 173 men and boys from the village aged 15 years or older were killed on 10 June 1942. A further 9 men from the village who were not present at the time were arrested and executed soon afterwards, along with 8 men and 7 women who were already under arrest, and two boys who had recently turned 15. Most of the 203 women and 105 children were sent to a makeshift detention center in a Kladno school, after which the women were deported to concentration camps. 9 children who were considered racially suitable and thus eligible for Germanisation were handed over to German families, and 82 (excluding 14 children either under a year old or born after the massacre) were sent to the Che\u0142mno extermination camp where they were gassed to death.\nThe Associated Press, quoting German radio transmissions which it received in New York, said: \"All male grownups of the town were shot, while the women were placed in a concentration camp, and the children were entrusted to appropriate educational institutions.\" Approximately 340 people from Lidice were murdered in the German reprisal (192 men, 60 women and 88 children). After the war ended, only 143 women and 17 children returned.\nNazi propaganda openly and proudly announced the events at Lidice in direct contrast to the disinformation and secrecy involved with other crimes against civilian populations, with intense outrage occurring among Allied nations and particularly Anglosphere countries. The history has been depicted in multiple forms of media since the end of the conflict. Examples include two Hollywood movies made the year after the massacre, Hangmen Also Die! and Hitler's Madman, the internationally known drama film \"Operation Daybreak\", and the composer Bohuslav Martin\u016f composed the orchestral work \"Memorial to Lidice\".\nBackground.\nAssassination of Reinhard Heydrich.\nFrom 27 September 1941, SS-\"Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\" and General of Police Reinhard Heydrich had been acting as \"Reichsprotektor\" of the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. This area of the former state of Czechoslovakia had been occupied by Nazi Germany since 5 April 1939.\nOn the morning of 27 May 1942, Heydrich was being driven from his country villa at Panensk\u00e9 B\u0159e\u017eany to his office at Prague Castle. When he reached the Kobylisy area of Prague, his car was attacked (on behalf of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile) by the Slovak and Czech soldiers Jozef Gab\u010d\u00edk and Jan Kubi\u0161. These men, who had been part of a team trained in Great Britain, had parachuted into Bohemia in December 1941 as part of Operation Anthropoid.\nAfter Gab\u010d\u00edk's Sten gun jammed, Heydrich ordered his driver, SS-\"Oberscharf\u00fchrer\" Klein, to stop the car. When Heydrich stood up to shoot Gab\u010d\u00edk, Kubi\u0161 threw a modified anti-tank grenade at Heydrich's car. The resulting explosion wounded both Heydrich and Kubi\u0161. Heydrich sent Klein to chase Gab\u010d\u00edk on foot and, in an exchange of fire, Gab\u010d\u00edk shot Klein in the leg below the knee. Kubi\u0161 and Gab\u010d\u00edk managed to escape the scene. A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a delivery van. He was placed on his stomach in the back of the van and taken to the emergency room at Bulovka Hospital. A splenectomy was performed, and the chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided. Himmler ordered Karl Gebhardt to fly to Prague to assume care. Despite a fever, Heydrich's recovery appeared to progress well. Hitler's personal doctor Theodor Morell suggested the use of the new antibacterial drug sulfonamide, but Gebhardt thought that Heydrich would recover and declined the suggestion. On 4 June Heydrich died from septicaemia caused by pieces of horse hair from the upholstery and his clothing entering his body when the bomb exploded.\nReprisals.\nLate in the afternoon of 27 May, SS-\"Gruppenf\u00fchrer\" Karl Hermann Frank proclaimed a state of emergency and placed a curfew in Prague. Anyone who helped the attackers was to be executed along with their families. A search involving 21,000 men began and 36,000 houses were checked. By 4 June, 157 people had been executed as a result of the reprisals but the assassins had not been found and no information was forthcoming.\nThe eulogies at Heydrich's funeral in Berlin were not yet over when, on 9 June, the decision was made to \"make up for his death\". Frank, Secretary of State for the Nazi Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, reported from Berlin that the \"F\u00fchrer\" had commanded the following concerning any village found to have harbored Heydrich's killers:\nV\u00e1clav \u0158\u00edha letter.\nLidice was targeted due to events stemming from a love letter sent by a man named V\u00e1clav \u0158\u00edha to his lover Anna Maru\u0161\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1, neither of whom were from Lidice. Seeking to end his extramarital affair with Maru\u0161\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1, \u0158\u00edha wrote to her implying he had taken part in the Heydrich assassination, stating he had done \"what he wanted to do\" and that the two would never see each other again. The letter was delivered on 3 June 1942 to the factory where Maru\u0161\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 worked, but because Maru\u0161\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 was sick and at home that day, factory owner Jaroslav P\u00e1la opened the letter instead. Believing its content to be serious, P\u00e1la contacted the police who in turn notified the Gestapo. Even though it was subsequently revealed that \u0158\u00edha had nothing to do with the assassination, Maru\u0161\u010d\u00e1kov\u00e1 when interrogated said that \u0158\u00edha had asked her to send greetings to the parents of Josef Hor\u00e1k, a Lidice man who had left to join the British Royal Air Force. This gave the Gestapo the pretext to target Lidice.\nMassacre.\nMen.\nHorst B\u00f6hme, the SiPo chief for the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately acted on Frank's orders. On the evening of 9 June 1942, members of the \"Ordnungspolizei\" and SD (\"Sicherheitsdienst\") surrounded the village of Lidice, blocking all avenues of escape. The Nazi regime claimed it chose this village because its residents were suspected of harbouring local resistance partisans and were associated with aiding Operation Anthropoid team members.\nAll men of the village 15 years of age or older (and one 14-year-old) were rounded up and taken to the farm of the Hor\u00e1k family on the edge of the village. Mattresses were taken from neighbouring houses where they were stood up against the wall of the Hor\u00e1ks' barn to prevent ricochets. The shooting of the men commenced at about 7:00\u00a0am on 10 June. At first the men were shot in groups of five, but B\u00f6hme thought the executions were proceeding too slowly and ordered that ten men be shot at a time. The dead were left lying where they fell. This continued until the afternoon hours when there were 173 dead. Another 9 men who were not in the village that day (7 workers on a night shift, 1 in hospital, 1 who hid several days in the forest) were arrested and executed in Prague-Kobylisy soon afterwards, as were 8 men and 7 women already under arrest because they had relations serving with the Czechoslovak armies in exile in the United Kingdom, and two boys who were discovered to have recently turned 15.\nOnly three male inhabitants of the village survived the massacre, two of whom were in the Czechoslovak Air Force and stationed in England at the time. The only adult man from Lidice actually in Czechoslovakia who survived this atrocity was Franti\u0161ek Saidl (1887\u20131961), the former deputy-mayor of Lidice who had been arrested at the end of 1938 because on 19 December 1938 he accidentally killed his son Eduard Saidl. He was imprisoned for four years and had no idea about this massacre. He found out when he returned home on 23 December 1942. Upon discovering the massacre, he was so distraught he turned himself in to SS officers in the nearby town of Kladno, confessed to being from Lidice, and even said he approved of the assassination of Heydrich. Despite confirming his identity, the SS officers simply laughed at him and turned him away, and he went on to survive the war.\nWomen and children.\nThe women and children of Lidice were first taken to Lidice village school, then to the nearby town of Kladno, where they were detained in the grammar school for three days. In Kladno, the children were separated from their mothers. On 12 June 1942, 184 women of Lidice were loaded on trucks, driven to Kladno railway station and forced into a special passenger train guarded by an escort. On the morning of 14 June, the train arrived at the concentration camp at Ravensbr\u00fcck. The camp authorities tried to keep the Lidice women isolated, but were prevented from doing so by other inmates. The women were forced to work in leather processing, road building, textile and ammunition factories. 12 remaining Lidice women were sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck in the following months.\nIn Kladno, three children who were judged to possess Nordic features were selected on the spot for Germanisation. Seven children younger than one year old were taken to a foundling hospital in Prague-Vinohrady, and in August 1943 (except one child who died) were moved to a children's shelter in Prague-Kr\u010d. On 13 June, 88 Lidice children were transported to the area of the former textile factory in Gneisenau Street in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. Their arrival was announced by a telegram from Horst B\u00f6hme's Prague office which ended with: \"the children are only bringing what they wear. No special care is desirable.\" The care was minimal and they suffered from a lack of hygiene and from illnesses. By order of the camp management, no medical care was given to the children. Shortly after their arrival in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, officials from the Central Race and Settlement branch chose seven additional children for Germanisation. The few children considered racially suitable for Germanisation were handed over to SS or other German families.\nThe furore over Lidice caused some hesitation over the fate of the remaining children, but in late June Adolf Eichmann ordered the massacre of the remainder of the children. However, Eichmann was not convicted of this crime at his trial in Jerusalem, as the judges deemed that \"... it has not been proven to us beyond reasonable doubt, according to the evidence before us, that they were murdered.\" On 1 July, the children were allowed to write letters to their families, which would later be returned as undeliverable. On 2 July, all of the remaining 81 Lidice children were handed over to the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Gestapo office, who sent them to the Che\u0142mno extermination camp away, where they were gassed to death in Magirus gas vans. One girl who had been selected for Germanisation in Kladno was also later deemed unsuitable and gassed in Che\u0142mno, alongside the children from Le\u017e\u00e1ky, another destroyed Czech village. Seven children were born to Lidice mothers after the massacre; one in Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp who was immediately killed, and six in a Prague maternity ward, of whom two survived the war.\nOf the 203 Lidice women, 53 died in concentration camps, seven others were executed, and 143 survived. 82 of the 105 Lidice children were murdered in Che\u0142mno, six others died during the war, and 17 returned home.\nLidice.\nThe village was set on fire and the remains of the buildings destroyed with explosives. All the animals in the village\u2014pets and beasts of burden\u2014were slaughtered as well. Even those buried in the town cemetery were not spared; their remains were dug up, looted for gold fillings and jewellery, and destroyed. A 100-strong German work party was then sent in to remove all visible remains of the village, re-route the stream running through it and the roads in and out. They then covered the entire area the village had occupied with topsoil and planted crops, and set up a barbed-wire fence around the site which had notices reading, in both Czech and German, \"Anyone approaching this fence who does not halt when challenged will be shot\". A film was made of the process by Franz Treml, a collaborator with German intelligence. Treml had run a Zeiss-Ikon shop in Lucerna Palace in Prague and after the Nazi occupation, he became a film adviser for the Nazi Party.\nFurther reprisals.\nThe small Czech village of Le\u017e\u00e1ky was destroyed two weeks after Lidice, when Gestapo agents found a radio transmitter there that had belonged to an underground team who parachuted in with Kubi\u0161 and Gab\u010d\u00edk. All 33 adults (both men and women) from the village were shot. The children were sent to concentration camps or \"Aryanised\". The death toll resulting from the effort to avenge the death of Heydrich is estimated at over 1,300 people. This count includes relatives of the partisans, their supporters, Czech elites suspected of disloyalty and random victims like those from Lidice.\nBetween 19 April and 5 May 1945, the Nazis destroyed and massacred the populations of four Czech settlements as retribution for their support of anti-Nazi partisans: Javo\u0159\u00ed\u010dko, Plo\u0161tina, Prlov and Va\u0159\u00e1kovy Paseky.\nCommemorations.\nInternational response.\nNazi propaganda had openly and proudly announced the events in Lidice, unlike other massacres in occupied Europe which were kept secret. The information was instantly picked up by Allied media. After the massacre Winston Churchill proposed destroying three German villages with incendiary bombing for every village destroyed in reprisals by the Wehrmacht. Anthony Eden, Leo Amery, and Ernest Bevin were supportive of the idea, but Archibald Sinclair, Clement Attlee, Herbert Morrison, and Stafford Cripps convinced him that it would waste resources and open the risk to similar Luftwaffe reprisals against British communities. In September 1942, coal miners in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in Great Britain led by Barnett Stross, a doctor, who in 1945 became a local MP, founded the organisation \"Lidice Shall Live\" to raise funds for the rebuilding of the village after the war.\nSoon after the razing of the village, towns and quarters (neighbourhoods) in various countries were renamed, San Jer\u00f3nimo L\u00eddice in Mexico City, Barrio Obrero de L\u00eddice (workers quarter of Lidice) and its hospital in Caracas, Venezuela, L\u00eddice de Capira in Panama and towns in Brazil so that the name would live on in spite of Hitler's intentions. A neighbourhood in Crest Hill, Illinois, U.S., was renamed from Stern Park to Lidice. There is a shrine at Lidice park on Prairie Avenue in Crest Hill; the original shrine was at the end of Kelly Avenue at Elsie Street. A square in the English city of Coventry, devastated by Luftwaffe bombing, is named after Lidice. An alley in a very crowded area of downtown Santiago, Chile, is named after Lidice and one of the buildings has a small plaque that explains its tragic story. A street in Sofia, Bulgaria, is named to commemorate the massacre and the Lidice Memorial in Phillips, Wisconsin, U.S., was built in memory of the village.\nIn the wake of the massacre, Humphrey Jennings directed \"The Silent Village\" (1943), using amateur actors from a Welsh mining village, Cwmgiedd, near the small South Wales town of Ystradgynlais. An American film was made in 1943 called \"Hitler's Madman\", but it contained a number of inaccuracies in the story. A more accurate British film, \"Operation Daybreak\", starring Timothy Bottoms as Kubi\u0161, Martin Shaw as \u010curda and Anthony Andrews as Gab\u010d\u00edk, was released in 1975.\nAmerican poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote a book-length verse play on the massacre, \"The Murder of Lidice\", which was excerpted in the 17 October 1942, edition of \"Saturday Review\", a larger version of which was published in the 19 October 1942 \"Life\" magazine, and published in full as a book later that year by Harper.\nThere is a memorial sculpture and small information panel commemorating the Lidice massacre, in Wallanlagen Park in Bremen, Germany.\nLocal response and the new Lidice.\nCzech composer Bohuslav Martin\u016f composed his \"Memorial to Lidice\", an 8-minute orchestral work, in 1943, as a response to the massacre. The piece quotes from the Czech \"St Wenceslas Chorale\" and in the climax of the piece, the opening notes (dot-dot-dot-dash = \"V\" in Morse code) of Beethoven's 5th Symphony.\nWomen from Lidice who survived imprisonment at Ravensbr\u00fcck returned after the Second World War and were rehoused in the new village of Lidice that was built overlooking the original site. The first part of the new village was completed in 1949. Two men from Lidice were in the United Kingdom serving in the Royal Air Force at the time of the massacre. After 1945 Pilot Officer Josef Hor\u00e1k and Flight Lieutenant Josef St\u0159\u00edbrn\u00fd returned to Czechoslovakia to serve in the Czechoslovak Air Force.\nAfter the 1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat the new Communist Party government would not allow them to apply to be housed in the new Lidice, because they had served in the forces of one of the western powers. Hor\u00e1k and his family returned to Britain and the RAF; he died in a flying accident in December 1948.\nA sculpture from the 1990s by Marie Uchytilov\u00e1 overlooks the site of the old village of Lidice. Entitled \"The Memorial to the Children Victims of the War\" it comprises 82 bronze statues of children (42 girls and 40 boys) aged 1 to 16, to honour the children who were murdered at Che\u0142mno in the summer of 1942. A cross with a crown of thorns marks the mass grave of the Lidice men. Overlooking the site is a memorial area flanked by a museum and a small exhibition hall. The memorial area is linked to the new village by an avenue of linden trees. In 1955 a \"Rosarium\" of 29,000 rose bushes was created beside the avenue of lindens overlooking the site of the old village. In the 1990s the Rosarium was neglected but after 2001 a new Rosarium with 21,000 bushes was created.\nIn 2024 as the state of the monument was damaged by time and conditions, a public collection started raising funds to restore it. A surprise donation was made by an American donor that boosted the project as it received $165,000. As it turns out the donor was Donald R. Yadesky, a long-time supporter and member of the Friends of History Society.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The execution was retribution in the form of collective punishment for Resistance activity in the area, including the capture and subsequent execution of \"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Helmut K\u00e4mpfe, the 3rd Battalion commander of 4th SS Panzergrenadier Regiment, and a close friend of the 1st battalion commander of the same regiment, Waffen-SS \"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Adolf Diekmann, who an informant incorrectly claimed had been burned alive in front of an audience. Both of them were battalion commanders in the 2nd SS Panzer Division \"Das Reich\". \nThe Germans murdered everyone they found in the village at the time, as well as people brought in from the surrounding area. The death toll includes people who were merely passing by in the village at the time of the SS company's arrival. Men were brought into barns and sheds where they were shot in the legs and doused with petroleum before the barns were set on fire. Women and children were herded into a church that was set on fire; those who tried to escape through the windows were machine gunned. Extensive looting took place.\nAll in all, 642 people are recorded to have been murdered. The death toll includes 17 Spanish citizens, 8 Italians (a woman with 7 of her 9 children), and 3 Poles.\nOnly six people are known to have survived the massacre \u2014 five men and one woman. A seventh survivor was discovered later and murdered. The last living survivor, Robert H\u00e9bras, known for his activism for reconciliation between France, Germany, and Austria, died on 11 February 2023, aged 97. He was 18 years old at the time of the massacre.\nThe village was never rebuilt. A completely new village was built nearby after the war. President Charles de Gaulle ordered that the ruins of the old village be maintained as a permanent memorial and museum.\nIn 1983 SS-Untersturmfuhrer Heinz Barth became the first senior commander to face trial for the massacre, claiming before a judge that he was shocked that there were any survivors and that the decision was made to wipe the village from the face of the Earth. But there were survivors that were in attendance to see Barth sentenced to life imprisonment.\nBackground.\nIn February 1944, the 2nd SS Panzer Division \"Das Reich\" was stationed in the Southern French town of Valence-d'Agen, north of Toulouse, waiting to be resupplied with new equipment and fresh troops. Following the Normandy landings in June 1944, the division was ordered north to help stop the Allied advance. One of its units was the 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment \"Der F\u00fchrer\". Its staff included regimental commander \"SS-Standartenf\u00fchrer\" Sylvester Stadler, \"SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Adolf Diekmann commanding the 1st Battalion and \"SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Otto Weidinger, Stadler's designated successor who was with the regiment for familiarisation. Command passed to Weidinger on 14 June.\nEarly on the morning of 10 June 1944, Diekmann informed Weidinger that he had been approached by two members of the \"Milice\", a paramilitary force of the Vichy Regime. They claimed that a \"Waffen-SS\" officer was being held prisoner by the French Resistance in Oradour-sur-Vayres, a nearby village. The captured officer was claimed to be \"SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Helmut K\u00e4mpfe, commander of the 2nd SS Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion (also part of the \"Das Reich\" division). \nK\u00e4mpfe was captured on 9 June 1944 while traveling in a German army vehicle marked as an ambulance protected by the Geneva Convention east of Saint-L\u00e9onard-de-Noblat by a group led by a Sergeant Jean Canou from \"Colonel Georges Guingouin's Brigade\", a militant Communist group in the Maquis du Limousin. Canou handed him over to Guingouin. The following day K\u00e4mpfe was executed on the orders of Guingouin. According to a French informant K\u00e4mpfe was burned alive in front of an audience.\nMassacre.\nOn 10 June, Diekmann's battalion sealed off Oradour-sur-Glane and ordered everyone within to assemble in the village square to have their identity papers examined. This included six non-residents who happened to be bicycling through the village when the SS unit arrived. The women and children were locked in the church, and the village was looted. The men were led to six barns and sheds, where machine guns were already in place. According to a survivor's account, the SS men then began shooting, aiming for the victims' legs. When they were unable to move, the SS men covered them with fuel and set the barns on fire. Only five men and one woman managed to escape. A seventh initial survivor was later seen walking down a road and was shot dead. In all, 190 of the men died.\nBurning of women and children in the church.\nThe SS men next proceeded to the church and placed an incendiary device beside it. When it was ignited, women and children tried to escape through the doors and windows, only to be met with machine-gun fire. 247 women and 205 children died in the attack. The only survivor was 47-year-old Marguerite Rouffanche. She escaped through a rear sacristy window, followed by a young woman and child. All three were shot, two of them fatally. Rouffanche crawled to some pea bushes and remained hidden overnight until she was found and rescued the next morning. About twenty villagers had fled Oradour-sur-Glane as soon as the SS unit had appeared. That night, the village was partially razed.\nSeveral days later, the survivors were allowed to bury the 642 dead inhabitants of Oradour-sur-Glane who had been killed in just a few hours. Adolf Diekmann said the atrocity was in retaliation for the partisan activity in nearby Tulle and the kidnapping and murder of SS commander Helmut K\u00e4mpfe, who was burned alive in a field ambulance with other German soldiers.\nAmongst the men of the town killed were three priests who worked in the parish. It was also reported that the SS troops desecrated the church, including deliberately scattering Communion hosts before they forced the women and children into it. The Bishop of Limoges visited the village in the days after the massacre, one of the first public figures to do so, and his account of what he witnessed is one of the earliest available. Amongst those who went to bury the dead and document the event by taking photographs were some local seminarians.\nMurphy report.\nRaymond J. Murphy, a 20-year-old American B-17 navigator shot down over Avord, France in late April 1944, witnessed the aftermath of the massacre. After being hidden by the French Resistance, Murphy was flown to England on 6 August, and in debriefing filled in a questionnaire on 7 August and made several drafts of a formal report. The version finally submitted on 15 August has a handwritten addendum:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;About 3 weeks ago, I saw a town within 4 hours bicycle ride up [\"sic\"] the Gerbeau farm [of Resistance leader Camille Gerbeau] where some 500 men, women, and children had been murdered by the Germans. I saw one baby who had been crucified.\nMurphy's report was made public in 2011 after a Freedom of Information Act request by his grandson, an attorney in the United States Department of Justice National Security Division. It is the only account to mention crucifying a baby. Shane Harris concludes that the addendum is a true statement by Murphy and that the town, not named in Murphy's report, is very likely Oradour-sur-Glane.\nGerman response.\nProtests at Diekmann's unilateral action followed, both from Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, General Walter Gleiniger, German commander in Limoges, as well as the Vichy Government. The commander of the 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, SS-\"Standartenf\u00fchrer\" Sylvester Stadler ordered a court martial into the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane. SS-\"Sturmbannf\u00fchrer\" Adolf Diekmann, the commander of the 1st Battalion, 4th SS Panzer Grenadier Regiment, and a personal friend of K\u00e4mpfe, was charged over the killings. He said he found K\u00e4mpfe's handcuffed body inside a German field ambulance with the remains of other German soldiers just outside the village of Oradour-sur-Glane. The vehicle had been set alight burning alive everyone inside. After seeing his friend's fate, the village was destroyed on his orders. SS-\"Brigadef\u00fchrer\" Heinz Lammerding, Das Reich's division commander, agreed that Diekmann should face a court martial. All charges were dropped when Diekmann was killed fighting in Normandy on June 29, 1944.\nPostwar trials.\nOn 12 January 1953, a military tribunal in Bordeaux heard the charges against the surviving 65 of the 200 or so SS men who had been involved. Only 21 of them were present, as many were in West and East Germany, which would not extradite them. Seven of those present for the charges were German citizens, but 14 were Alsatians, French nationals whose home region had been occupied by Germany in 1940 and later integrated into the German Reich. All but one of the Alsatians claimed to have been forced to join the Waffen-SS. Such forced conscripts from Alsace and Lorraine called themselves the \"malgr\u00e9-nous\", meaning \"against our will\".\nOn 11 February, 19 of the 20 defendants were convicted. Five received terms of imprisonment and two were executed. Continuing uproar in Alsace (including demands for autonomy) pressed the French parliament to pass an amnesty law for all the \"malgr\u00e9-nous\" on 19 February. The convicted Alsatian former SS men were released shortly afterwards, which caused bitter protests in the Limousin region.\nBy 1958 the remaining German defendants had been released. General Heinz Lammerding of the Das Reich division, who had given the orders for retaliation against the Resistance, died in 1971, following a successful entrepreneurial career. At the time of the trial, he lived in D\u00fcsseldorf, in the former British occupation zone of West Germany, and the French government never obtained his extradition from West Germany.\nThe last trial of a Waffen-SS member who had been involved took place in 1983. Former \"SS-Obersturmf\u00fchrer\" Heinz Barth was tracked down in East Germany. Barth had participated in the massacre as a platoon leader in the \"\"Der F\u00fchrer\" regiment, commanding 45 SS men. He was one of several charged with giving orders to shoot 20 men in a garage. Barth was sentenced to life imprisonment by the First Senate of the City Court of Berlin. He was released from prison in the reunified Germany in 1997 and died in August 2007.\nOn 8 January 2014, Werner Christukat, an 88-year-old former member of the 3rd Company of the 1st Battalion of the \"Der F\u00fchrer\"\" regiment was charged, by the state court in Cologne, with 25 charges of murder and hundreds of counts of accessory to murder in connection with the massacre in Oradour-sur-Glane. The suspect, who was identified only as Werner C., had until 31 March 2014 to respond to the charges. If the case went to trial, it could have possibly been held in a juvenile court because the suspect was only 19 at the time it occurred. According to his attorney, Rainer Pohlen, the suspect acknowledged being at the village but denied being involved in any killings. On 9 December 2014, the court dropped the case, citing a lack of any witness statements or reliable documentary evidence able to disprove the suspect's contention that he was not a part of the massacre. Christukat died in 2020.\nMemorial.\nAfter the war, General Charles de Gaulle decided the village should never be rebuilt, but would remain a memorial to the cruelty of the Nazi occupation. The new village of Oradour-sur-Glane (population 2,375 in 2012), northwest of the site of the massacre, was built after the war. The ruins of the original village remain as a memorial to the dead and to represent similar sites and events.\nIn 1999 French president Jacques Chirac dedicated a memorial museum, the \"Centre de la m\u00e9moire d'Oradour\", near the entrance to the \"Village Martyr\" (\"martyred village\"). Its museum includes items recovered from the burned-out buildings: watches stopped at the time their owners were burned alive, glasses melted from the intense heat, and various personal items.On 6 June 2004, at the commemorative ceremony of the Normandy invasion in Caen, German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der pledged that Germany would not forget the Nazi atrocities and specifically mentioned Oradour-sur-Glane.\nOn 4 September 2013, German president Joachim Gauck and French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande visited the ghost village of Oradour-sur-Glane. A joint news conference broadcast by the two leaders followed their tour of the site. This was the first time a German president had come to the site of one of the biggest World War II massacres on French soil.\nOn 28 April 2017, French presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron visited Oradour-sur-Glane and met with the only remaining survivor of the massacre, Robert H\u00e9bras. H\u00e9bras was 18 at the time of the massacre and died at age 97 in 2023.\nIn popular culture.\nTelevision\nFilm\nLiterature\nMusic\nMusical\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A vector field on a plane can be visualized as a collection of arrows with given magnitudes and directions, each attached to a point on the plane. Vector fields are often used to model, for example, the speed and direction of a moving fluid throughout three dimensional space, such as the wind, or the strength and direction of some force, such as the magnetic or gravitational force, as it changes from one point to another point.\nThe elements of differential and integral calculus extend naturally to vector fields. When a vector field represents force, the line integral of a vector field represents the work done by a force moving along a path, and under this interpretation conservation of energy is exhibited as a special case of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Vector fields can usefully be thought of as representing the velocity of a moving flow in space, and this physical intuition leads to notions such as the divergence (which represents the rate of change of volume of a flow) and curl (which represents the rotation of a flow).\nA vector field is a special case of a \"vector-valued function\", whose domain's dimension has no relation to the dimension of its range; for example, the position vector of a space curve is defined only for smaller subset of the ambient space.\nLikewise, n coordinates, a vector field on a domain in \"n\"-dimensional Euclidean space formula_1 can be represented as a vector-valued function that associates an \"n\"-tuple of real numbers to each point of the domain. This representation of a vector field depends on the coordinate system, and there is a well-defined transformation law (\"covariance and contravariance of vectors\") in passing from one coordinate system to the other.\nVector fields are often discussed on open subsets of Euclidean space, but also make sense on other subsets such as surfaces, where they associate an arrow tangent to the surface at each point (a tangent vector).\nMore generally, vector fields are defined on differentiable manifolds, which are spaces that look like Euclidean space on small scales, but may have more complicated structure on larger scales. In this setting, a vector field gives a tangent vector at each point of the manifold (that is, a section of the tangent bundle to the manifold). Vector fields are one kind of tensor field.\nDefinition.\nVector fields on subsets of Euclidean space.\nGiven a subset \"S\" of R\"n\", a vector field is represented by a vector-valued function \"V\": \"S\" \u2192 R\"n\" in standard Cartesian coordinates (\"x\"1, \u2026, \"x\"\"n\"). If each component of \"V\" is continuous, then \"V\" is a continuous vector field. It is common to focus on smooth vector fields, meaning that each component is a smooth function (differentiable any number of times). A vector field can be visualized as assigning a vector to individual points within an \"n\"-dimensional space.\nOne standard notation is to write formula_3 for the unit vectors in the coordinate directions. In these terms, every smooth vector field formula_4 on an open subset formula_5 of formula_6 can be written as\nformula_7\nfor some smooth functions formula_8 on formula_5. The reason for this notation is that a vector field determines a linear map from the space of smooth functions to itself, formula_10, given by differentiating in the direction of the vector field.\nExample: The vector field formula_11 describes a counterclockwise rotation around the origin in formula_12. To show that the function formula_13 is rotationally invariant, compute:\nformula_14\nGiven vector fields \"V\", \"W\" defined on \"S\" and a smooth function f defined on \"S\", the operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition,\nformula_15\nmake the smooth vector fields into a module over the ring of smooth functions, where multiplication of functions is defined pointwise.\nCoordinate transformation law.\nIn physics, a vector is additionally distinguished by how its coordinates change when one measures the same vector with respect to a different background coordinate system. The transformation properties of vectors distinguish a vector as a geometrically distinct entity from a simple list of scalars, or from a covector.\nThus, suppose that (\"x\"1, ..., \"x\"\"n\") is a choice of Cartesian coordinates, in terms of which the components of the vector V are\nformula_16\nand suppose that (\"y\"1...,\"y\"\"n\") are \"n\" functions of the \"x\"\"i\" defining a different coordinate system. Then the components of the vector \"V\" in the new coordinates are required to satisfy the transformation law\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSuch a transformation law is called contravariant. A similar transformation law characterizes vector fields in physics: specifically, a vector field is a specification of \"n\" functions in each coordinate system subject to the transformation law (1) relating the different coordinate systems.\nVector fields are thus contrasted with scalar fields, which associate a number or \"scalar\" to every point in space, and are also contrasted with simple lists of scalar fields, which do not transform under coordinate changes.\nVector fields on manifolds.\nGiven a differentiable manifold formula_17, a vector field on formula_17 is an assignment of a tangent vector to each point in formula_17. More precisely, a vector field formula_20 is a mapping from formula_17 into the tangent bundle formula_22 so that formula_23 is the identity mapping\nwhere formula_24 denotes the projection from formula_22 to formula_17. In other words, a vector field is a section of the tangent bundle.\nAn alternative definition: A smooth vector field formula_27 on a manifold formula_17 is a linear map formula_29 such that formula_27 is a derivation: formula_31 for all formula_32.\nIf the manifold formula_17 is smooth or analytic\u2014that is, the change of coordinates is smooth (analytic)\u2014then one can make sense of the notion of smooth (analytic) vector fields. The collection of all smooth vector fields on a smooth manifold formula_17 is often denoted by formula_35 or formula_36 (especially when thinking of vector fields as sections); the collection of all smooth vector fields is also denoted by formula_37 (a fraktur \"X\").\nExamples.\nGradient field in Euclidean spaces.\nVector fields can be constructed out of scalar fields using the gradient operator (denoted by the del: \u2207).\nA vector field \"V\" defined on an open set \"S\" is called a gradient field or a conservative field if there exists a real-valued function (a scalar field) \"f\" on \"S\" such that\nformula_38\nThe associated flow is called the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;gradient flow, and is used in the method of gradient descent.\nThe path integral along any closed curve \"\u03b3\" (\"\u03b3\"(0) = \"\u03b3\"(1)) in a conservative field is zero:\nformula_39\nCentral field in euclidean spaces.\nA \"C\"\u221e-vector field over R\"n\" \\ {0} is called a central field if\nformula_40\nwhere O(\"n\", R) is the orthogonal group. We say central fields are invariant under orthogonal transformations around 0.\nThe point 0 is called the center of the field.\nSince orthogonal transformations are actually rotations and reflections, the invariance conditions mean that vectors of a central field are always directed towards, or away from, 0; this is an alternate (and simpler) definition. A central field is always a gradient field, since defining it on one semiaxis and integrating gives an antigradient.\nOperations on vector fields.\nLine integral.\nA common technique in physics is to integrate a vector field along a curve, also called determining its line integral. Intuitively this is summing up all vector components in line with the tangents to the curve, expressed as their scalar products. For example, given a particle in a force field (e.g. gravitation), where each vector at some point in space represents the force acting there on the particle, the line integral along a certain path is the work done on the particle, when it travels along this path. Intuitively, it is the sum of the scalar products of the force vector and the small tangent vector in each point along the curve.\nThe line integral is constructed analogously to the Riemann integral and it exists if the curve is rectifiable (has finite length) and the vector field is continuous.\nGiven a vector field V and a curve \u03b3, parametrized by t in [\"a\", \"b\"] (where a and b are real numbers), the line integral is defined as\nformula_41\nTo show vector field topology one can use line integral convolution.\nDivergence.\nThe divergence of a vector field on Euclidean space is a function (or scalar field). In three-dimensions, the divergence is defined by\nformula_42\nwith the obvious generalization to arbitrary dimensions. The divergence at a point represents the degree to which a small volume around the point is a source or a sink for the vector flow, a result which is made precise by the divergence theorem.\nThe divergence can also be defined on a Riemannian manifold, that is, a manifold with a Riemannian metric that measures the length of vectors.\nCurl in three dimensions.\nThe curl is an operation which takes a vector field and produces another vector field. The curl is defined only in three dimensions, but some properties of the curl can be captured in higher dimensions with the exterior derivative. In three dimensions, it is defined by\nformula_43\nThe curl measures the density of the angular momentum of the vector flow at a point, that is, the amount to which the flow circulates around a fixed axis. This intuitive description is made precise by Stokes' theorem.\nIndex of a vector field.\nThe index of a vector field is an integer that helps describe its behaviour around an isolated zero (i.e., an isolated singularity of the field). In the plane, the index takes the value \u22121 at a saddle singularity but +1 at a source or sink singularity.\nLet \"n be\" the dimension of the manifold on which the vector field is defined. Take a closed surface (homeomorphic to the (n-1)-sphere) S around the zero, so that no other zeros lie in the interior of S. A map from this sphere to a unit sphere of dimension \"n\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 can be constructed by dividing each vector on this sphere by its length to form a unit length vector, which is a point on the unit sphere S\"n\"\u22121. This defines a continuous map from S to S\"n\"\u22121. The index of the vector field at the point is the degree of this map. It can be shown that this integer does not depend on the choice of S, and therefore depends only on the vector field itself.\nThe index is not defined at any non-singular point (i.e., a point where the vector is non-zero). It is equal to +1 around a source, and more generally equal to (\u22121)\"k\" around a saddle that has \"k\" contracting dimensions and \"n\"\u2212\"k\" expanding dimensions.\nThe index of the vector field as a whole is defined when it has just finitely many zeroes. In this case, all zeroes are isolated, and the index of the vector field is defined to be the sum of the indices at all zeroes.\nFor an ordinary (2-dimensional) sphere in three-dimensional space, it can be shown that the index of any vector field on the sphere must be 2. This shows that every such vector field must have a zero. This implies the hairy ball theorem.\nFor a vector field on a compact manifold with finitely many zeroes, the Poincar\u00e9-Hopf theorem states that the vector field's index is the manifold's Euler characteristic.\nPhysical intuition.\nMichael Faraday, in his concept of \"lines of force,\" emphasized that the field \"itself\" should be an object of study, which it has become throughout physics in the form of field theory.\nIn addition to the magnetic field, other phenomena that were modeled by Faraday include the electrical field and light field.\nIn recent decades many phenomenological formulations of irreversible dynamics and evolution equations in physics, from the mechanics of complex fluids and solids to chemical kinetics and quantum thermodynamics, have converged towards the geometric idea of \"steepest entropy ascent\" or \"gradient flow\" as a consistent universal modeling framework that guarantees compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics and extends well-known near-equilibrium results such as Onsager reciprocity to the far-nonequilibrium realm.\nFlow curves.\nConsider the flow of a fluid through a region of space. At any given time, any point of the fluid has a particular velocity associated with it; thus there is a vector field associated to any flow. The converse is also true: it is possible to associate a flow to a vector field having that vector field as its velocity.\nGiven a vector field formula_4 defined on formula_5, one defines curves formula_46 on formula_5 such that for each formula_48 in an interval formula_49,\nformula_50\nBy the Picard\u2013Lindel\u00f6f theorem, if formula_4 is Lipschitz continuous there is a \"unique\" formula_52-curve formula_53 for each point formula_54 in formula_5 so that, for some formula_56,\nformula_57\nThe curves formula_53 are called integral curves or trajectories (or less commonly, flow lines) of the vector field formula_4 and partition formula_5 into equivalence classes. It is not always possible to extend the interval formula_61 to the whole real number line. The flow may for example reach the edge of formula_5 in a finite time.\nIn two or three dimensions one can visualize the vector field as giving rise to a flow on formula_5. If we drop a particle into this flow at a point formula_24 it will move along the curve formula_65 in the flow depending on the initial point formula_24. If formula_24 is a stationary point of formula_4 (i.e., the vector field is equal to the zero vector at the point formula_24), then the particle will remain at formula_24.\nTypical applications are pathline in fluid, geodesic flow, and one-parameter subgroups and the exponential map in Lie groups.\nComplete vector fields.\nBy definition, a vector field on formula_17 is called complete if each of its flow curves exists for all time. In particular, compactly supported vector fields on a manifold are complete. If formula_27 is a complete vector field on formula_17, then the one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms generated by the flow along formula_27 exists for all time; it is described by a smooth mapping\nformula_75\nOn a compact manifold without boundary, every smooth vector field is complete. An example of an incomplete vector field formula_4 on the real line formula_77 is given by formula_78. For, the differential equation formula_79, with initial condition formula_80, has as its unique solution formula_81 if formula_82 (and formula_83 for all formula_84 if formula_85). Hence for formula_82, formula_87 is undefined at formula_88 so cannot be defined for all values of formula_48.\nThe Lie bracket.\nThe flows associated to two vector fields need not commute with each other. Their failure to commute is described by the Lie bracket of two vector fields, which is again a vector field. The Lie bracket has a simple definition in terms of the action of vector fields on smooth functions formula_90:\nformula_91\n\"f\"-relatedness.\nGiven a smooth function between manifolds, formula_92, the derivative is an induced map on tangent bundles, formula_93. Given vector fields formula_94 and formula_95, we say that formula_96 is formula_90-related to formula_4 if the equation formula_99 holds.\nIf formula_100 is formula_90-related to formula_102, formula_103, then the Lie bracket formula_104 is formula_90-related to formula_106.\nGeneralizations.\nReplacing vectors by \"p\"-vectors (\"p\"th exterior power of vectors) yields \"p\"-vector fields; taking the dual space and exterior powers yields differential \"k\"-forms, and combining these yields general tensor fields.\nAlgebraically, vector fields can be characterized as derivations of the algebra of smooth functions on the manifold, which leads to defining a vector field on a commutative algebra as a derivation on the algebra, which is developed in the theory of differential calculus over commutative algebras.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

R. R. Tolkien's fantasy novels \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". From there, both Bilbo and Frodo set out on their adventures, and both return there, for a while. As such, Bag End represents the familiar, safe, comfortable place which is the antithesis of the dangerous places that they visit. It forms one end of the main story arcs in the novels, and since the Hobbits return there, it also forms an end point in the story circle in each case. \nTolkien described himself as a Hobbit in all but size. Scholars have noted that Bag End is a vision of Tolkien's ideal home, and effectively an expression of character. Peter Jackson built an elaborate Hobbiton film set including a detailed Bag End in New Zealand for his \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series.\nDescription.\nJ. R. R. Tolkien.\n\"The Hobbit\" begins with \"among the most famous first lines in literature\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.\nThe protagonists of \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, lived at Bag End, a luxurious \"smial\" or Hobbit-burrow, dug into The Hill on the north side of the town of Hobbiton in the Shire's Westfarthing. Tolkien made drawings of Bag End and Hobbiton. His watercolour \"The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the Water\" shows the exterior and the surrounding countryside. Tolkien made several pencil and ink sketches for these subjects, only gradually settling on Bag End's final location and architecture.\nAnother of Tolkien's drawings, \"The Hall at Bag-End, Residence of B. Baggins Esquire\", depicts the interior, complete with 20th century fittings such as a wall clock and barometer. Another clock is mentioned in chapter 2 of \"The Hobbit\". The barometer is mentioned in Tolkien's drafts of \"The Hobbit\".\nPeter Jackson.\nPeter Jackson had an elaborate Hobbiton film set built on the Alexander sheep farm at Matamata in New Zealand for his \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series. It included a water-mill, the Green Dragon Inn, and several Hobbit-holes as well as Bag End in a small hill, with garden. Jackson said of the set, \"It felt as if you could open the circular green door of Bag End and find Bilbo Baggins inside.\"\nChad Chisholm and colleagues, reviewing Jackson's 2012 film \"\" for \"Mallorn\", write that Jackson humorously has the \"rough and ready\" Dwarves \"bursting into Bilbo's neat little home and cleaning out his pantry\", providing \"a sort of constant comic relief to the dangers in the dark\".\nAnalysis.\nReal-world origins.\n\"Bag End\" was the real name of the Tudor home, dated to 1413, of Tolkien's aunt Jane Neave in the village of Dormston, Worcestershire.\nThe scholar of literature and film Steven Woodward and the architectural historian Kostis Kourelis suggest that Tolkien may have based his Hobbit-holes on Iceland's turf houses, such as those at Keldur.\nCharacter from architecture.\nTolkien stated \"I am in fact a Hobbit\", and scholars agree that he was in many ways like his Hobbits, enjoying good food, gardening, smoking a pipe, and living in a familiar and comfortable home. Tolkien makes Bag End a place where, in the Tolkien scholar Thomas Honegger's words, \"most readers feel severely tempted to put on their imaginary slippers and settle down to a piece of cake and some tea.\" Honegger argues that places have a critical role in \"The Lord of the Rings\", and the function of the safe Hobbit-hole is to establish the character of the \"\"hol-bytlan\" (hole-dwellers), in the first place stationary beings who have a deep-rooted aversion against travelling outside the Shire.\" For them, Honegger writes, \"Travelling abroad belongs to the same class as adventures\", quoting Bilbo's remark in \"The Hobbit\": \"Nasty disturbing uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\"\nJoseph Wright's 1898\u20131905 \"The English Dialect Dictionary\" has an entry for \"hobman\", one of many possible sources of the word \"hobbit\", which states that \"Each elf-man or hobman had his habitation, to which he gave his name\". The Tolkien scholar Michael Livingston comments that from this it is easy \"to recall the man-like, elf-friend, hole-dwelling hobbit Mr. Baggins of Bag-End, hired by the not-too-dissimilar dwarves to commit thievery\".\nThe scholar of literature Johanna Brooke writes in the \"Journal of Tolkien Research\" that the character of Bilbo Baggins can be inferred from the architecture of Bag End, just as that of Hobbits in general can be deduced from their preference for living in holes. She suggests that Bag End is an Arts and Crafts building, fitting into the ideas of the designer William Morris and others in the period between 1880 and 1920. Features such as Bag End's panelled walls, tiles, and carpet could all, Brooke writes, have been manufactured by Morris &amp; Co., while the prosperous Hobbit-hole clearly indicates that Bilbo is middle-class. Its position at the top of The Hill \"demonstrates a physical and social elevation above other hole-owners\", since as Tolkien wrote in the Prologue to \"The Lord of the Rings\", \"suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels...were not everywhere to be found\". \nBrooke notes Tolkien's statement that \"only the richest and poorest\" in fact were able to continue the traditional Hobbit-practice of living in holes: the poor might have, as Tolkien said, \"burrows of the most primitive kind... with only one window or none\". Bag End is sharply contrasted with such a burrow, its best rooms being provided with \"deep-set round windows\". Brooke comments that Tolkien has shown this in \"The Hill: Hobbiton-across-the-Water\", where Bag End has several windows while the Hobbit-holes further down (of Bagshot Row) have fewer. Other signifiers of wealth and class include such Victorian era comforts as a dining-room, multiple pantries, and wardrobes. Such things could indicate, Brooke writes, that Bag End's owner is \"indulgent, overly-luxurious, too comfortable, a tad vain even\", though against this, the hanging-space for many hats and coats suggests that welcoming guests is important to him. Brooke quotes Morris's remark that \"the working man cannot afford to live in anything that an architect could design; moderate-sized rabbit-warrens [are] for rich middle-class men\", stating that with its mention of rabbit warrens, this \"aptly suits Bag End\".\nThe cartographer Karen Wynn Fonstad created a plan of Bag End, showing her vision of its comfortable layout with many cellars and pantries, complete with multiple fireplaces and chimneys, based on the clues given by Tolkien in \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\". Her plan makes Bag End some long and up to wide, cut into the Hill. Honegger writes that Fonstad's work has contributed substantially to giving Middle-earth an \"independent existence\".\nOnly one outlet.\nThe Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey writes that the name Bag End is a direct translation of the French \"cul-de-sac\" (\"bottom of [a] bag\"), something that he calls \"a silly phrase... a piece of 'French-oriented snobbery', used in England to mean a dead end, a road with only one outlet\"; he notes that the French say \"impasse\" for the same thing. The journeys of Bilbo and Frodo have been interpreted as just such confined roads, as they both start and end in Bag End. According to Don D. Elgin, Tolkien's \"A Walking Song\", which appears repeatedly in differing forms in \"The Lord of the Rings\" as the quest progresses, is \"a song about the roads that go ever on until they return to at last to the familiar things they have always known.\" As such, it forms one end of the main story arcs in both \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\", and since the Hobbits return there, it also forms an end point in the story circle in each case.\nThe most desirable residence.\nThe journalist Matthew Dennison compares Lobelia Sackville-Baggins's desire to move into Bag End to the similarly-named aristocrat Vita Sackville-West's passionate attachment to her family home, Knole House, which she was unable to inherit. Sackville-West became famous as a novelist and poet, and by the time \"The Lord of the Rings\" was published, as \"The Observer\"'s gardening columnist. Dennison notes that \"Lobelia\" is a garden flower, and that readers in the 1950s would immediately have linked the character to the famous gardener. \nShippey argues that the Bagginses and the Sackville-Bagginses are \"connected opposites\", since the opposite of a bourgeois is a burglar, a person who breaks into bourgeois houses, and in \"The Hobbit\" Bilbo is asked to become a burglar, to break into the lair of Smaug the dragon. He observes that the name Sackville-Baggins, for the snobbish branch of the Baggins family, is a philological joke, as \"Sac[k]-ville\" can be translated as the French form of the humble \"Bag Town\", another attempt to reinforce the family's bourgeois status by \"Frenchify[ing]\" their surname.\nContrasts with faraway places.\nThe historian Joseph Loconte wrote that Tolkien had set up a contrast between Frodo's light and serene Bag End and the corrupted wizard Saruman's dark and industrially destructive Isengard. Loconte likens this to the contrast in Tolkien's fellow-Inkling C. S. Lewis's 1950 children's book \"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\" between the delightful but humble home of Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, and the icy opulence of the palace of the White Witch. In Loconte's view, both authors \"reintroduce[d] into the popular imagination a Christian vision of hope in a world tortured by doubt and disillusionment\".\nHonegger points out a quite different contrast, between Bag End as depicted in Tolkien's drawing \"The Hall at Bag End\", \"the homely yet narrowly limited space of a hobbit-hole with the similarly neat and defined landscape of the Shire in the background,\" with his \"The Forest of Lothl\u00f3rien in Spring\", which shows \"no particular place, but an airy glade in a forest filled with sunlight, evoking a feeling of sheltered openness.\" If the Shire is a \"secluded [and] remote \"petit bourgeois\" idyll\", then, Honegger suggests, Lothl\u00f3rien is a \"transcendental [or] idealised idyll\". Further, the comfortable Hobbit-holes of the Shire stand in contrast to the untamed nature of the Old Forest, the idyllic Rivendell, and even to what had been the \"promised land\" of the Dwarves, Moria. The same applies, Honegger argues, to time: where Bag End and the Shire are anachronistically in the present, the Old Forest, Rivendell, and Lothl\u00f3rien represent journeys back into the past.\nStrangeness.\nBag End receives strange visitors \u2013 Gandalf and the Dwarves, making it seem a \"queer place\", in the character Ted Sandyman's words, \"and its folk are queerer\". Bilbo and Frodo come to be seen as strange also. Bilbo is \"very rich and very peculiar\", not least because he seems not to grow old, but also because he went on a journey outside the Shire, and returned changed. David LaFontaine writes in \"The Gay and Lesbian Review Worldwide\" that Bilbo is a \"confirmed bachelor\" who is never \"linked romantically\" with any woman, and who lives alone in the \"luxurious, lovely environment\", Bag End, \"illustrating the hobbit's artistic sensibility\". LaFontaine comments that Tolkien admires Bilbo's \"unconventional lifestyle ... almost to the point of envy.\" To LaFontaine, Tolkien's account of Bilbo's \"queerness\" is to be interpreted as a portrait of a homosexual man.\nParody.\nThe 1969 parody novel \"Bored of the Rings\", written by the \"National Lampoon\" founders Henry Beard and Douglas Kenney, mocks Frodo's homecoming from his dangerous quest to Bag End with the words \"he walked directly to his cozy fire and slumped in the chair. He began to muse upon the years of delicious boredom that lay ahead. Perhaps he would take up Scrabble\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Prior to September 13, 2007, the company was known as Forgent Networks. After rebranding as Asure Software, the company expanded into offering human capital management (HCM) solutions, including payroll, time &amp; attendance, talent management, human resource management, benefits administration and insurance services.\nIt also had a software division, NetSimplicity, which specialized in room scheduling and fixed assets' management software, which was spun off in 2019.\nPatents and litigation.\nJPEG.\nIn 2002, while known as Forgent, the company claimed that through its subsidiary, Compression Labs, it owned the patent rights on the JPEG image compression standard, which is widely used on the World Wide Web. Its claim arose from a patent that had been filed on October 27, 1986, and granted on October 6, 1987: https:// by Wen-Hsiung Chen and Daniel J. Klenke. While Forgent did not own Compression Labs at the time, Chen later sold the company to Forgent before joining Cisco.\nCritics claim that the legal principle of laches, hence not asserting one's rights in a timely manner, invalidates Forgent's claims on the patent. They also noted the similarity to Unisys' attempts to assert rights over the GIF image compression standard via LZW patent enforcement. The JPEG committee responded to Forgent's claims, stating that it believes prior art exists that would invalidate Forgent's claims, and launched a search for prior art evidence. The 1992 JPEG specification cited two earlier research papers written by Wen-Hsiung Chen, published in 1977 and 1984. JPEG representative Richard Clark also claimed that Chen sat in one of the JPEG committees, but Forgent denied this claim.\nIn April 2004, Forgent stated that 30 companies had already paid US$90 million in royalties. On April 23, lawsuits were filed against 31 companies, including Adobe Systems, Apple Computer and IBM, for infringement of their patent. On September 26, 2005, Axis Communications, one of the defendants, announced a settlement with Compression Labs Inc.; the terms were not disclosed. As of late October 2005, six companies were known to have licensed the patent from Forgent including Adobe, Macromedia, Axis, Color Dreams, and Research In Motion.\nOn May 25, 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office rejected the broadest part of Forgent's claims, stating prior art submitted by the Public Patent Foundation invalidated those claims. PubPat's Executive Director, Dan Ravicher, says that the submitters knew about the prior art but failed to tell the USPTO about it. On August 11, 2006, Forgent received notice from the NASDAQ stock market regarding non-compliance with the minimum bid price rule, which can lead to delisting, before coming back into compliance in January 2007.\nThe company issued a press release on November 1, 2006, stating that they settled their remaining claims against roughly 60 companies for a total of $8 million which was paid by, among other companies, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems.\nDigital video recorders.\nForgent Networks shifted its focus to a computer controlled video system, allowing playback during recording. While the patent was filed in 1991, the first litigation was initiated in 2005. On May 21, 2007, U.S. District Court of Eastern Texas ruled in favor of EchoStar Communications Corporation, on grounds that the Forgent patent is invalid.\nAsure Software.\nAfter Forgent Networks acquired iEmployee and changed its name to Asure Software, the website of the combined company no longer listed information related to the two patents - '672 and '746, unlike the old Forgent Networks website.\nProxy Fight.\nIn 2008, the company was the target of a proxy fight launched by Pinnacle Fund (\"Pinnacle\") and Red Oak Partners, managed by David Sandberg. After negotiations, a slate of 5 new directors was elected on August 28, 2009 to replace the previous board. \nAcquisitions.\nOn September 13, 2007, Forgent acquired iEmployee.\nOn October 3, 2011, Asure Software announced that it had acquired ADI Time, a vendor of cloud computing time and attendance software and labor management services. On March 21, 2016, it announced the acquisition of Mangrove Employer Services, which developed human resource management software; it began massive layoffs of previous Mangrove employees in June 2016.\nIn May 2017, Asure acquired the Tampa-based company Compass HRM Inc.\nIn April 2018, Asure acquired Austin HR, an Austin based HR Consulting &amp; Payroll &amp; Benefit Administration company. On December 2, 2019, Asure Software announced that it completed the sale of its Workspace Management Business to FM:Systems.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The machines use an ARM CPU, developed by Acorn spinoff company ARM, and were thereby not IBM PC-compatible.\nAt launch, the original Risc PC 600 model was fitted as standard with an ARM 610, a 32-bit RISC CPU (with 26-bit address bus) with 4\u00a0KB of cache and clocked at 30\u00a0MHz. CPU technology advanced rapidly in this period though and within only two years a DEC StrongARM could be installed at 233\u00a0MHz which was around 8 times faster.\nThe machines were supplied with the RISC OS operating system which has a windowed cooperative multi-tasking design. Unusually for a PC of the period the O/S was stored in ROM, which enabled a relatively fast boot time. In addition Acorn sold a Virtual PC package that permitted x86 applications to be run in a virtual machine; they also supported the development of an ARM Linux distribution from 1996.\nIn contrast to most contemporary IBM clones, the machines supported multiple processors as a standard feature. Secondary (or \"guest\") CPUs did not need to be ARM based and could be an entirely different architecture. It was possible to add an x86 CPU which enabled use of operating systems including DOS and Windows 95. Cards could often be added to other machines of the era to run DOS software but more usually these would implement the majority of an IBM PC clone on the card. The Risc PC required only the addition of the relevant CPU with some interface logic.\nAlternative operating systems ran concurrently with RISC OS in a window. Applications from both operating systems could run at the same time in a similar fashion to a virtual machine with data shared between them. While now a ubiquitous technology, this was a less common feature in 1994 and more usually only one operating system would run at once on a single PC.\nThe Risc PC had a novel case design where additional chassis, known as \"slices\", could be stacked on top of each other, expanding the height of the machine. Up to six additional slices could be stacked, each containing additional drives or expansion cards (known as \"podules\"). At the time the IBM clone industry was standardised around the PCI bus, but Acorn used its own bus implementation that was not compatible and required its own unique expansion cards. The machines did use the then industry standard IDE or SCSI drives found in contemporary PCs. \nAcorn discontinued production of the Risc PC in 1998 after a corporate reorganisation but Castle Technology continued manufacturing the machines until 2003 and subsequently then produced their own similar designs. RISC OS is still available after becoming an open source product.\nUse.\nThe Risc PC was used by music composers and scorewriters to run the Sibelius scorewriting software.\nBetween 1994 and 2008, the Risc PC and A7000+ were used in television for broadcast automation, programmed by the UK company OmniBus Systems: once considered \"the world leader in television station automation\" and at one point automating \"every national news programme on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom\". The Risc PC, in the form of the OmniBus Workstation, and a customised version of the A7000+ built into a 19-inch rack mount unit, known as the OmniBus Interface Unit, were used to control/automate multiple television broadcast devices from other manufacturers in a way that was unusual at the time. In 2002, OmniBus products were \"in constant use worldwide at nearly 100 broadcasters\" including the BBC and ITN.\nRisc PC 2.\nAcorn set about designing the Risc PC 2, later renamed to Phoebe 2100\u00a0\u2013 a design with a 64\u00a0MHz front-side bus, PCI slots, and a yellow NLX form-factor case. Slated for release in late 1998, the project was abandoned just before completion, when Acorn's Workstation Division was closed. Only two prototypes were ever built, and one was publicly displayed for historical interest at the RISC OS 2001 show in Berkshire, England. The remaining cases were bought by CTA Direct who sold them off to the public.\nAfter Acorn.\nIn 2003 it was confirmed that no more Risc PCs would be produced. However RISC OS computers based on other ARM processors machines have been manufactured by companies since this date.\nSignificantly better performance has been reached on the aged Risc PC design by using the newer 203 (and later 236) MHz StrongARM CPU, using third-party video cards, overclocking, and having specially designed CPU cards with RAM located upon them to sidestep the speed bottleneck of the slow system bus.\nLimitations.\nThe 16\u00a0MHz front-side bus is usually recognised as being the most significant fault of the computer; and the arrival of the (five times faster) StrongARM processor in 1996 meant that the Risc PC had a CPU significantly faster than the computer had been designed for. Acorn had originally expected ARM\u00a0CPUs to progress from the 30\u00a0MHz ARM6 to the 40\u00a0MHz ARM7, and then onto the ARM8 cores, which at the time were clocked at around 50\u201380\u00a0MHz. In 2000, Castle released \"Kinetic\", a new StrongARM processor board with its own onboard memory slots augmenting main memory, reducing the need to negotiate the slow front-side bus for memory accesses.\nThe podule bus on the Risc PC can achieve a maximum data throughput of approximately 6100\u00a0KByte/s. It is 32-bit and Risc PC predecessors have a 16-bit bus. For comparison, the PCI bus, which was available in systems at the time of the Risc PC's introduction, is over 20 times faster. The transfer of 650\u00a0MB would take 2 minutes via podule, compared to 5 seconds via PCI.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is a debate about the date of its composition, with possible dates ranging from 1598 to 1608.\nThe play is considered one of Shakespeare's \"problem plays\", those that pose ethical dilemmas that require more than typically simple solutions.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSynopsis.\nHelena, the low-born ward of a French-Spanish countess and daughter of a recently deceased physician, is in love with the countess's son, Bertram, who is indifferent to her. Bertram goes to Paris to replace his late father as attendant to the ailing King of France. Helena follows Bertram, ostensibly to offer the King her services as a healer. The King is sceptical, and she guarantees the cure with her life: if he dies, she will be put to death, but if he lives, she may choose a husband from the court.\nThe King is cured and Helena chooses Bertram, who rejects her, owing to her poverty and low status. The King forces him to marry her, but after the ceremony Bertram immediately goes to war in Italy without so much as a goodbye kiss. He says he will marry her only after she has carried his child and got his family ring from him. Helena returns home to the countess, who is horrified at what her son has done, and claims Helena as her child in Bertram's place.\nIn Italy, Bertram is a successful warrior and becomes infatuated with Diana, the virgin daughter of an impoverished local noblewoman. Helena follows Bertram to Italy, befriends Diana, and arranges to take Diana's place in bed with him. Diana obtains Bertram's ring in exchange for one of Helena's. In this way Helena, without Bertram's knowledge, consummates their marriage and is given his ring.\nHelena fakes her own death. Bertram, thinking he is free of her, comes home. He tries to marry a French lord's daughter with whom he had previously fallen in love, but Diana turns up and causes the engagement to be broken off. Helena appears and explains the ring swap, announcing that she has fulfilled Bertram's challenge; Bertram, impressed by all she has done to win him, swears his love to her. Thus all ends well.\nThere is a subplot about Parolles, a disloyal friend of Bertram's. Helena, Lafew, the Countess, her fool Lavatch and the two Lords Dumaine have all realised that Parolles is a boastful coward, but Bertram still takes him to war with him. The two Lords convince Parolles to cross into enemy territory to fetch a drum lost in battle. While he is on his way, they pose as enemy soldiers, kidnap him, blindfold him, and, with Bertram observing, get him both to betray his friends and to surrender a letter warning Diana about Bertram's lascivious character.\nSources.\nThe play is based on the tale of Giletta di Narbona (tale nine of day three) of Boccaccio's \"The Decameron\". F. E. Halliday speculated that Shakespeare may have read a French translation of the tale in William Painter's \"Palace of Pleasure\".\nAnalysis and criticism.\nThere is no evidence that \"All's Well That Ends Well\" was popular in Shakespeare's time and it has remained one of his lesser-known plays ever since, in part due to its unorthodox mixture of fairy tale logic, gender role reversals and cynical realism. Helena's love for the seemingly unlovable Bertram is difficult to explain on the page, but in performance, it can be made acceptable by casting an extremely attractive actor and emphasising the possibility of a homosexual relationship between Bertram and the \"clothes horse\" fop Parolles: \"A filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl\" (Act III, scene 5). This interpretation also assists at the point in the final scene when Bertram suddenly switches from hatred to love in just one line. This is considered a particular problem for actors trained to admire psychological realism. Some alternative readings emphasise the \"if\" in his equivocal promise: \"If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.\" Here, there has been no change of heart at all. Productions like London's National Theatre in 2009 have Bertram make his promise seemingly normally, but then end the play hand in hand with Helena, staring out at the audience with a look of \"aghast bewilderment\" suggesting he relented only to save face in front of the King.\nA 2018 interpretation by director Caroline Byrne at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, London, effects Bertram's reconciliation with Helena by having him make good his vow (Act 2 Scene 2) of taking her as his wife only when she bears his child; as well as Bertram's ring, Helena brings their infant child to their final confrontation before the king.\nMany critics consider the truncated ending, with Bertram's sudden conversion, a flaw. Speculative explanations have been given for it. As always, there may be missing text. Some suggest that Bertram's conversion is meant to be sudden and magical in keeping with the play's 'clever wench performing tasks to win an unwilling higher-born husband' theme. Some think that Bertram is not meant to be contemptible but merely a callow youth learning valuable lessons about values. Andrew Hadfield of the University of Sussex argues that contemporary audiences would readily have recognised Bertram's enforced marriage as a metaphor for the new requirement (1606) for Catholics to swear an Oath of Allegiance to Protestant King James.\nOne character who has been admired is the Countess of Roussillon, whom Shaw thought \"the most beautiful old woman's part ever written\". Modern productions are often promoted as vehicles for great mature actresses; recent examples have starred Judi Dench and Peggy Ashcroft, who delivered a performance of \"entranc[ing]...worldly wisdom and compassion\" in Trevor Nunn's sympathetic, \"Chekhovian\" staging at Stratford in 1982. In the BBC Television Shakespeare production she was played by Celia Johnson, dressed and posed as Rembrandt's portrait of Margaretha de Geer.\nIt has recently been argued that Thomas Middleton either collaborated with Shakespeare on the play or revised it at a later time, but the proposed revisions are not universally accepted.\nPerformance history.\nNo records of early performances of \"All's Well That Ends Well\" have been found. In 1741, the work was played at Goodman's Fields, with a later transfer to Drury Lane. Rehearsals at Drury Lane started in October 1741 but William Milward, playing the king, fell ill, and the opening was delayed until 22 January. Peg Woffington, playing Helena, fainted on the first night and her part was read. Milward fell ill again on 2 February and died on 6 February. This, together with unsubstantiated tales of more illnesses befalling other actresses during the run, gave the play an \"unlucky\" reputation, similar to that attached to \"Macbeth\", which may have curtailed the number of revivals.\nHenry Woodward (1714\u20131777) popularised the part of Parolles in the era of David Garrick. Sporadic performances followed in the ensuing decades, with an operatic version at Covent Garden in 1832.\nThe play, with plot elements drawn from romance and the ribald tale, depends on gender role conventions, both as expressed (Bertram) and challenged (Helena). With evolving conventions of gender roles, Victorian objections centred on the character of Helena, who was variously deemed predatory, immodest and both \"really despicable\" and a \"doormat\" by Ellen Terry, who also\u2014and rather contradictorily\u2014accused her of \"hunt[ing] men down in the most undignified way\". Terry's friend George Bernard Shaw greatly admired Helena's character, comparing her with the New Woman figures such as Nora in Henrik Ibsen's \"A Doll's House\". The editor of the Arden Shakespeare volume summed up 19th-century repugnance: \"everyone who reads this play is at first shocked and perplexed by the revolting idea that underlies the plot.\"\nIn 1896, Frederick S. Boas coined the term \"problem play\" to include the unpopular work, grouping it with \"Hamlet\", \"Troilus and Cressida\" and \"Measure for Measure\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Historically known as Trebizond, the city was founded in 756 BC as Trapezous by colonists from Miletus. It was added into the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great and was later part of the independent Kingdom of Pontus that challenged Rome until 68 BC. Thenceforth part of the Roman and later Byzantine Empire, the city was the capital of the Empire of Trebizond, one of the successor states of the Byzantine Empire after the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In 1461 it came under Ottoman rule. During the early modern period, Trabzon, because of the importance of its port, again became a focal point of trade to Persia and the Caucasus. Today Trabzon is the second largest city and port on the Black Sea coast of Turkey with a population of almost 300,000. The urban population of the city is 330,836 (Ortahisar), with a metropolitan population of 822,270. Trabzon has 18 districts in total.\nName.\nThe Turkish name of the city is Trabzon. The first recorded name of the city is the Greek ('), referencing the table-like central hill between the Za\u011fnos (\u0130skeleboz) and Kuzgun streams on which it was founded (' meant \"table\" in Ancient Greek; note the table on the coin in the figure). In Latin, Trabzon is called ', which is a latinization of its ancient Greek name. Both in Pontic Greek and Modern Greek, it is called ('). In Ottoman Turkish and Persian, it is written as . During Ottoman times, \"Tara Bozan\" was also used. In Laz it is known as (\"T'amt'ra\") or \"T'rap'uzani\", in Georgian it is (\"T'rap'izoni\") and in Armenian it is (\"Trapizon\"). The 19th-century Armenian travelling priest Byjiskian called the city by other, native names, including \"Hur\u015fidabat\" and \"Ozinis\". Western geographers and writers used many spelling variations of the name throughout the Middle Ages. These versions of the name, which have incidentally been used in English literature as well, include: \"Trebizonde\" (Fr.), \"Trapezunt\" (German), \"Trebisonda\" (Sp.), \"Trapesunta\" (It.), \"Trapisonda\", \"Tribisonde\", \"Terabesoun\", \"Trabesun\", \"Trabuzan\", \"Trabizond\" and \"Tarabossan\".\nIn Spanish the name was known from chivalric romances and \"Don Quixote\".\nBecause of its similarity to and , acquired the meaning \"hullabaloo, imbroglio\".\nHistory.\nIron Age and Classical Antiquity.\nBefore the city was founded as a Greek colony the area was dominated by Colchians (west Georgian) and Chaldian (Anatolian) tribes. The Hayasa, who had been in conflict with the Central-Anatolian Hittites in the 14th century BC, are believed to have lived in the area south of Trabzon. Later Greek authors mentioned the Macrones and the Chalybes as native peoples. One of the dominant Caucasian groups to the east were the Laz, who were part of the monarchy of the Colchis, together with other related Georgian peoples.\nThe city was founded in classical antiquity in 756 BC as T\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2 (\"Trapezous\"), by Milesian traders from Sinope. It was one of a number (about ten) of Milesian \"emporia\" or trading colonies along the shores of the Black Sea. Others included Abydos and Cyzicus in the Dardanelles, and nearby Kerasous. Like most Greek colonies, the city was a small enclave of Greek life, and not an empire unto its own, in the later European sense of the word. As a colony, Trapezous initially paid tribute to Sinope, but early banking (money-changing) activity is suggested to have occurred in the city already in the 4th century BC, according to a silver drachma coin from Trapezus in the British Museum, London. Cyrus the Great added the city to the Achaemenid Empire, and was possibly the first ruler to consolidate the eastern Black Sea region into a single political entity (a satrapy).\nTrebizond's trade partners included the Mossynoeci. When Xenophon and the Ten Thousand mercenaries were fighting their way out of Persia, the first Greek city they reached was Trebizond (Xenophon, \"Anabasis\", 5.5.10). The city and the local Mossynoeci had become estranged from the Mossynoecian capital, to the point of civil war. Xenophon's force resolved this in the rebels' favor, and so in Trebizond's interest.\nUp until the conquests of Alexander the Great the city remained under the dominion of the Achaemenids. While the Pontus was not directly affected by the war, its cities gained independence as a result of it. Local ruling families continued to claim partial Persian heritage, and Persian culture had some lasting influence on the city; the holy springs of Mt. Minthrion to the east of the old town were devoted to the Persian-Anatolian Greek god Mithra. In the 2nd century BC, the city with its natural harbours was added to the Kingdom of Pontus by Pharnaces I. Mithridates VI Eupator made it the home port of the Pontic fleet, in his quest to remove the Romans from Anatolia.\nAfter the defeat of Mithridates in 66 BC, the city was first handed to the Galatians, but it was soon returned to the grandson of Mithradates, and subsequently became part of the new client Kingdom of Pontus. When the kingdom was finally annexed to the Roman province of Galatia two centuries later, the fleet passed to new commanders, becoming the \"Classis Pontica\". The city received the status of civitas libera, extending its judicial autonomy and the right to mint its own coin. Trebizond gained importance for its access to roads leading over the Zigana Pass to the Armenian frontier or the upper Euphrates valley. New roads were constructed from Persia and Mesopotamia under the rule of Vespasian. In the next century, the emperor Hadrian commissioned improvements to give the city a more structured harbor. The emperor visited the city in the year 129 as part of his inspection of the eastern border (limes). A mithraeum now serves as a crypt for the church and monastery of Panagia Theoskepastos (\"K\u0131zlar Manast\u0131r\u0131\") in nearby Kizlara, east of the citadel and south of the modern harbor.\nSeptimius Severus punished Trebizond for having supported his rival Pescennius Niger during the Year of the Five Emperors. In 257 the city was pillaged by the Goths, despite reportedly being defended by \"10,000 above its usual garrison\" and two bands of walls. Trebizond was subsequently rebuilt, pillaged again, by the Persians, in 258, and then rebuilt once more. It did not soon recover. Only in the reign of Diocletian does an inscription allude to the restoration of the city; Ammianus Marcellinus had nothing to say of Trebizond except that it was \"not an obscure town.\" \nChristianity had reached Trebizond by the third century, for during the reign of Diocletian occurred the martyrdom of Eugenius and his associates Candidius, Valerian, and Aquila. Eugenius had destroyed the statue of Mithras which overlooked the city from Mount Minthrion (Boztepe), and became the patron saint of the city after his death. Early Christians sought refuge in the Pontic Mountains south of the city, where they established Vazelon Monastery in 270 AD and Sumela Monastery in 386 AD. As early as the First Council of Nicea, Trebizond had its own bishop. Subsequently, the Bishop of Trebizond was subordinated to the Metropolitan Bishop of Poti. Then during the 9th century, Trebizond itself became the seat of the Metropolitan Bishop of Lazica.\nByzantine period.\nBy the time of Justinian, the city served as an important base in his Persian Wars, and Miller notes that a portrait of the general Belisarius \"long adorned the church of St. Basil.\" An inscription above the eastern gate of the city, commemorated the reconstruction of the civic walls at Justinian's expense following an earthquake. At some point before the 7th century the university (Pandidakterion) of the city was reestablished with a quadrivium curriculum. The university drew students not just from the Byzantine Empire, but from Armenia as well.\nThe city regained importance when it became the seat of the theme of Chaldia. Trebizond also benefited when the trade route regained importance in the 8th to 10th centuries; 10th-century Muslim authors note that Trebizond was frequented by Muslim merchants, as the main source transshipping Byzantine silks into eastern Muslim countries. According to the 10th century Arab geographer Abul Feda it was regarded as being largely a Lazian port. The Italian maritime republics such as the Republic of Venice and in particular the Republic of Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries, using Trebizond as an important seaport for trading goods between Europe and Asia. Some of the Silk Road caravans carrying goods from Asia stopped at the port of Trebizond, where the European merchants purchased these goods and carried them to the port cities of Europe with ships. This trade provided a source of revenue to the state in the form of custom duties, or \"kommerkiaroi\", levied on the goods sold in Trebizond. The Greeks protected the coastal and inland trade routes with a vast network of garrison forts.\nFollowing the Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Trebizond came under Seljuk rule. This rule proved transient when an expert soldier and local aristocrat, Theodore Gabras took control of the city from the Turkish invaders, and regarded Trebizond, in the words of Anna Comnena, \"as a prize which had fallen to his own lot\" and ruled it as his own kingdom. Supporting Comnena's assertion, Simon Bendall has identified a group of rare coins he believes was minted by Gabras and his successors. Although he was killed by the Turks in 1098, other members of his family continued his de facto independent rule into the next century.\nEmpire of Trebizond.\nThe Empire of Trebizond was formed after a Georgian expedition in Chaldia, commanded by Alexios Komnenos a few weeks before the sack of Constantinople in 1204. Located at the far northeastern corner of Anatolia, it was the longest surviving of the Byzantine successor states. Byzantine authors, such as Pachymeres, and to some extent Trapezuntines such as Lazaropoulos and Bessarion, regarded the Trebizond Empire as being no more than a Lazian border state. Thus, from the point of view of the Byzantine writers connected with the Lascaris and later with the Palaiologos, the rulers of Trebizond were not emperors.\nGeographically, the Empire of Trebizond consisted of little more than a narrow strip along the southern coast of the Black Sea, and not much further inland than the Pontic Mountains. However, the city gained great wealth from the taxes it levied on the goods traded between Persia and Europe via the Black Sea. The Mongol siege of Baghdad in 1258 diverted more trade caravans towards the city. Genoese and to a lesser extent Venetian traders regularly came to Trebizond. To secure their part of the Black Sea trade, the Genoese bought the coastal fortification \"Leonkastron\", just west of the winter harbour, in the year 1306. The Venetians likewise built a trading outpost in the city, a few hundred meters to the west of the Genoese. In between these two Italian colonies settled many other European traders, and it thus became known as the \"European Quarter\". Small groups of Italians continued to live in the city until the early decades of the 20th century. One of the most famous persons to have visited the city in this period was Marco Polo, who ended his overland return journey at the port of Trebizond, and sailed to his hometown Venice with a ship; passing by Constantinople (Istanbul) on the way, which was retaken by the Byzantines in 1261.\nTogether with Persian goods, Italian traders brought stories about the city to Western Europe. Trebizond played a mythical role in European literature of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Miguel de Cervantes and Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais gave their protagonists the desire to possess the city. Next to literature, the legendary history of the city \u2013 and that of the Pontus in general \u2013 also influenced the creation of paintings, theatre plays and operas in Western Europe throughout the following centuries.\nThe city also played a role in the early Renaissance; the western takeover of Constantinople, which formalized Trebizond's political independence, also led Byzantine intellectuals to seek refuge in the city. Especially Alexios II of Trebizond and his grandson Alexios III were patrons of the arts and sciences. After the great city fire of 1310, the ruined university was reestablished. As part of the university Gregory Choniades opened a new academy of astronomy, which housed the best observatory outside Persia. Choniades brought with him the works of Shams al-Din al-Bukhari, Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and Abd al-Rahman al-Khazini from Tabriz, which he translated into Greek. These works later found their way to western Europe, together with the astrolabe. The observatory Choniades built would become known for its accurate solar eclipse predictions, but was probably used mostly for astrological purposes for the emperor and/or the church. Scientists and philosophers of Trebizond were among the first western thinkers to compare contemporaneous theories with classical Greek texts. Basilios Bessarion and George of Trebizond travelled to Italy and taught and published works on Plato and Aristotle, starting a fierce debate and literary tradition that continues to this day on the topic of national identity and global citizenship. They were so influential that Bessarion was considered for the position of Pope, and George could survive as an academic even after being defamed for his heavy criticism of Plato.\nThe Black Death arrived at the city in September 1347, probably via Kaffa. At that time the local aristocracy was engaged in the Trapezuntine Civil War.\nIn 1340, Tur Ali Beg, an early ancestor of the Aq Qoyunlu, raided Trebizond. In 1348, he besieged Trebizond, however he failed and lifted the siege. Later on, Alexios III of Trebizond gave his sister to Kutlu Beg son of Tur Ali Beg, and established a kinship with them.\nConstantinople remained the Byzantine capital until it was conquered by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II in 1453, who also conquered Trebizond eight years later, in 1461.\nIts demographic legacy endured for several centuries after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, as a substantial number of Greek Orthodox inhabitants, usually referred to as Pontic Greeks, continued to live in the area during Ottoman rule, up until 1923, when they were deported to Greece. A few thousand Greek Muslims still live in the area, mostly in the \u00c7aykara-Of dialectical region to the southeast of Trabzon. Most are Sunni Muslim, while there are some recent converts in the city and possibly a few Crypto-Christians in the Tonya/G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane area to the southwest of the city. Compared to most previously Greek cities in Turkey, a large amount of its Greek Byzantine architectural heritage survives as well.\nOttoman era.\nThe last Emperor of Trebizond, David, surrendered the city to Sultan Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire in 1461. Following this takeover, Mehmed II sent many Turkish settlers into the area, but the old ethnic Greek, Laz and Armenian communities remained. According to the Ottoman tax books (\"tahrir defterleri\"), the total population of taxable adult males (only those with a household) in the city was 1,473 in the year 1523.&lt;ref name=\"Modern Times page 27/28\"&gt;\"The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times\", Richard G. Hovannisian, page 27/28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The total population of the city was much higher. Approximately 85% of the population was Christian, and 15% Muslim. Thirteen percent of the adult males belonged to the Armenian community, while the vast majority of Christians were Greeks. However, a significant portion of the local Christians were Islamized by the end of the 17th century - especially those outside the city - according to a research by Prof. Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on the Ottoman tax books (\"tahrir defterleri\"). Between 1461 and 1598 Trabzon remained the administrative center of the wider region; first as 'sanjac center' of Rum Eyalet, later of Erzincan-Bayburt eyalet, Anadolu Eyalet, and Erzurum Eyalet.\nIn 1598 it became the capital of its own province - the Eyalet of Trebizond - which in 1867 became the Vilayet of Trebizond. During the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, his son Prince Selim (later Sultan Selim I) was the Sanjak-bey of Trabzon, and Selim I's son Suleiman the Magnificent was born in Trabzon in 1494. The Ottoman government often appointed local Chepni Turks and Laz beys as the regional beylerbey. It is also recorded that some Bosniaks were appointed by the Sublime Porte as the regional beylerbeys in Trabzon. The Eyalet of Trabzon had always sent troops for the Ottoman campaigns in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.\nTrebizond had a wealthy merchant class during the late Ottoman period, and the local Christian minority had a substantial influence in terms of culture, economy and politics. A number of European consulates were opened in the city due to its importance in regional trade and commerce. In the first half of the 19th century, Trebizond even became the main port for Persian exports. The opening of the Suez Canal greatly diminished the international trading position of the city, but did not halt the economic development of the region. In the last decades of the 19th century, the city saw some demographic changes. As the population of the province greatly expanded due to increased living standards, many families and young men - mostly Christians, but also some Jews and Greek or Turkish speaking Muslims - chose to migrate to the Crimea and southern Ukraine, in search for farmland or employment in one of the cities which had been newly established there. Among these migrants were the grandparents of Bob Dylan and Greek politicians and artists. Many Christian and Muslim families from Trabzon also moved to Constantinople, where they established businesses or sought employment - such as the grandfather of Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn. These migrants were active in a wide range of trades including baking, confection, tailoring, carpentry, education, advocacy, politics and administration. The influence of this diaspora has since continued, and can still be seen in the many restaurants and shops in cities around the Black Sea in the 21st century such as in Istanbul, Odesa and Mariupol. At the same time, thousands of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus arrived in the city, especially after 1864, in what is known as the Circassian genocide.\nNext to Constantinople, Smyrna (now \u0130zmir) and Salonika (now Thessaloniki), Trebizond was one of the cities where western cultural and technological innovations were first introduced to the Ottoman Empire. In 1835, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions opened the Trebizond Mission station that it occupied from 1835 to 1859 and from 1882 to at least 1892. Hundreds of schools were constructed in the province during the first half of the 19th century, giving the region one of the highest literacy rates of the empire. First, the Greek community set up their schools, but soon the Muslim and Armenian communities followed. International schools were also established in the city; An American school, five French schools, a Persian school and a number of Italian schools were opened in the second half of the 19th century. The city got a post office in 1845. New churches and mosques were built in the second half of the 19th century, as well as the first theater, public and private printing houses, multiple photo studios and banks. The oldest known photographs of the city center date from the 1860s and depict one of the last camel trains from Persia.\nBetween one and two thousand Armenians are believed to have been killed in the Trebizond vilayet during the Hamidian massacres of 1895. While this number was low in comparison to other Ottoman provinces, its impact on the Armenian community in the city was large. Many prominent Armenian residents, among them scholars, musicians, photographers and painters, decided to migrate towards the Russian Empire or France. The large Greek population of the city was not affected by the massacre. Ivan Aivazovsky made the painting \"Massacre of the Armenians in Trebizond 1895\" based on the events. Due to the high number of Western Europeans in the city, news from the region was being reported on in many European newspapers. These western newspapers were in turn also very popular among the residents of the city.\nOttoman era paintings and drawings of Trebizond\nModern era.\nIn 1901 the harbour was equipped with cranes by Stothert &amp; Pitt of Bath in England. In 1912 the S\u00fcmer Opera House was opened on the central Meydan square, being one of the first in the empire. The start of the First World War brought an abrupt end to the relatively peaceful and prosperous period the city had seen during the previous century. First Trebizond would lose many of its young male citizens at the Battle of Sarikamish in the winter of 1914\u201315, while during those same months the Russian navy bombarded the city a total of five times, taking 1300 lives. Especially the port quarter \u00c7\u00f6mlek\u00e7i and surrounding neighborhoods were targeted.\nIn July 1915 most of the adult male Armenians of the city were marched off south in five convoys, towards the mines of G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane, never to be seen again. Other victims of the Armenian genocide were reportedly taken out to sea in boats which were then capsized. In some areas of Trebizond province - such as the Karadere river valley in modern-day Arakl\u0131, 25 kilometers east of the city - the local Muslim population tried to protect the Christian Armenians.\nThe coastal region between the city and the Russian frontier became the site of key battles between the Ottoman and Russian armies during the Trebizond Campaign, as part of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I. The Russian army landed at Atina, east of Rize on March 4, 1916. Lazistan Sanjak fell within two days. However, due to heavy guerrilla resistance around Of and \u00c7aykara some 50\u00a0km to the east of Trabzon, it took a further 40 days for the Russian army to advance west. The Ottoman administration of Trabzon foresaw the fall of the city and called for a meeting with community leaders, where they handed control of the city to Greek metropolitan bishop Chrysantos Philippidis. \nChrysantos promised to protect the Muslim population of the city. Ottoman forces retreated from Trabzon, and on April 15 the city was taken without a fight by the Russian Caucasus Army under command of Grand Duke Nicholas and Nikolai Yudenich. There was also a massacre of Armenians and Greeks in Trabzon just before the Russian takeover of the city. \nIn early 1917 Chrysantos tried to broker a peace between the Russians and the Ottomans, to no avail. During the Russian Revolution of 1917 Russian soldiers in the city turned to rioting and looting, with officers commandeering Trebizonian ships to flee the scene. Governor Chrysantos was able to calm the Russian soldiers down, and the Russian Army ultimately retreated from the city and the rest of eastern and northeastern Anatolia. In March and April of 1918 the city hosted the Trebizond Peace Conference, where the Ottomans agreed to give up their military gains in the Caucasus in return for recognition of the eastern borders of the empire in Anatolia by the Transcaucasian Seim (a short-lived transcaucasian government). \nIn December 1918 Trabzon deputy governor Haf\u0131z Mehmet gave a speech at the Ottoman parliament in which he blamed the former governor of Trebizond province Cemal Azmi \u2013 a non-native appointee who had fled to Germany after the Russian invasion \u2013 for orchestrating the Armenian genocide in the city in 1915, by means of drowning. Subsequently, a series of war crimes trials were held in Trebizond in early 1919 (see Trebizond during the Armenian genocide). Among others, Cemal Azmi was sentenced to death in absentia.\nDuring the Turkish War of Independence several Christian Pontic Greek communities in the Trebizond province rebelled against the new army of Mustafa Kemal (notably in Bafra and Santa), but when nationalist Greeks came to Trabzon to proclaim revolution, they were not received with open arms by the local Pontic Greek population of the city. At the same time the Muslim population of the city, remembering their protection under Greek governor Chrysantos, protested the arrest of prominent Christians. Liberal delegates of Trebizond opposed the election of Mustafa Kemal as the leader of the Turkish revolution at the Erzurum Congress. \nThe governor and mayor of Trebizond were appalled by the violence against Ottoman Greek subjects, and the government of Trabzon thus refused arms to Mustafa Kemal's henchman Topal Osman, who was responsible for mass murders in the western Pontus which were part of the Greek genocide. Osman was forced out of the city by armed Turkish port-workers. Governor Chrysantos travelled to the Paris Peace Conference, where he proposed the establishment of the Republic of Pontus, which would protect its different ethnic groups. For this he was condemned to death by the Turkish Nationalist forces, and he could not return to his post in Trebizond. Instead, the city was to be handed to 'Wilsonian Armenia', which likewise never materialized. Following the war, the Treaty of S\u00e8vres was annulled and replaced with the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). As part of this new treaty, Trebizond became part of the new Turkish Republic. The efforts of the pro-Ottoman, anti-nationalist population of Trebizond only postponed the inevitable, because the national governments of Turkey and Greece agreed to a mutual forced population exchange. This exchange included well over 100,000 Greeks from Trebizond and the vicinity, who moved to Greece (founding the new towns of Nea Trapezounta, Pieria and Nea Trapezounta, Grevena amongst others). \nDuring the war Trebizond parliamentarian Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey had been one of the leading figures of the first Turkish opposition party. In his newspaper \"Tan\", \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc and colleagues publicized critiques of the Kemalist government, such as towards the violence perpetrated against Greeks during the population exchange. \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc argued that recognition of ethnic diversity was not a threat to the Turkish nation.\nTopal Osman's men would eventually murder parliamentarian \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc for his criticism of the nationalist government of Mustafa Kemal in March 1923. Topal Osman was later sentenced to death and killed while resisting arrest. After pressure from the opposition, his headless body was hanged by his foot in front of the Turkish parliament. Ali \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Bey, who had studied in Deniz Harp Okulu (Turkish Naval Academy) and worked as a journalist in the United Kingdom, is seen as a hero by the people of Trabzon, while in neighboring Giresun there is a statue of his murderer Topal Osman. Three years later Trabzon deputy Haf\u0131z Mehmet \u2013 who had testified to his knowledge of, and opposition to, the Armenian Ggenocide \u2013 was also executed, for his alleged involvement in the \u0130zmir plot to assassinate Mustafa Kemal. The literal decapitation of the Turkish political opposition \u2013 which was in large part based in the Trabzon region \u2013 decreased the city's national influence, and led to a long-standing animosity between the Kemalists and the population of Trabzon. A political and cultural divide between the Eastern Black Sea Region and the rest of Anatolia continued to exist throughout the 20th century, and still influences Turkish politics today. Even in the 21st century, politicians who hail from Trabzon are often faced with xenophobic attacks from both nationalist and conservative circles.\nDuring World War II shipping activity was limited because the Black Sea had again become a war zone. Hence, the most important export products, tobacco and hazelnuts, could not be sold and living standards degraded.\nAs a result of the general development of the country, Trabzon has developed its economic and commercial life. The coastal highway and a new harbour have increased commercial relations with central Anatolia, which has led to some growth. However, progress has been slow in comparison to the western and the southwestern parts of Turkey.\nTrabzon is famous throughout Turkey for its anchovies called \"hamsi\", which are the main meal in many restaurants in the city. Major exports from Trabzon include hazelnuts and tea.\nThe city still has a sizable community of Greek-speaking Muslims, most of whom are originally from the vicinities of Tonya, S\u00fcrmene and \u00c7aykara. However, the variety of the Pontic Greek language - known as \"Romeika\" in the local vernacular, \"Pontiaka\" in Greek, and \"Rumca\" in Turkish - is spoken mostly by the older generations.\nGeography.\nTrabzon Province has a total area of and is bordered by the provinces of Rize, Giresun, and G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015fhane. The total area is 22.4% plateau and 77.6% hills. The Pontic Mountains pass through the Trabzon Province.\nTrabzon used to be an important reference point for navigators in the Black Sea during harsh weather conditions. The popular expression \"perdere la Trebisonda\" (losing Trebizond) is still commonly used in the Italian language to describe situations in which the sense of direction is lost. The Italian maritime republics such as Venice and in particular Genoa were active in the Black Sea trade for centuries.\nTrabzon has four lakes: Uzung\u00f6l, \u00c7ak\u0131rg\u00f6l, Sera, and Haldizen Lakes. There are several streams, but no rivers in Trabzon.\nClimate.\nTrabzon has a climate typical of the eastern Black Sea region, a humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen: \"Cfa,\" Trewartha\": Cf\") near the coast. A very small percentage of the province can be classified as subtropical, however, as slightly elevated rural areas near the coast are oceanic (\"Cfb/Do\"), the mountainous offshores are humid continental (\"Dfb/Dc\") and subarctic (\"Dfc/Eo\"); and tundra (\"ET/Ft\") can be found in the peaks of the Pontic Alps. Furthermore, during the time the K\u00f6ppen climate classification was created, the city center had a borderline oceanic-humid subtropical climate, falling just under the threshold for the hottest month of the year, yet climate change and the city's urban heat island contributed to its reclassification as humid subtropical in recent decades. This and the fact that the subtropical microclimate zone along the shore occupies a very narrow band due to the continuous parallel mountain range starting right at the coast is why local authorities still classify the city as oceanic, as this climate subtype is better representative of the entire coastal region of the province.\nSummers are warm, the average maximum temperature is around in August, while winters are generally cool, the lowest average minimum temperature is almost in February. Precipitation is heaviest in autumn and winter, with a marked reduction in the summer months, a microclimatic condition of the city center compared to the rest of the region. Snowfall is somewhat common between the months of December and March, snowing for a week or two, and it can be heavy once it snows (this is due to the \"lake-effect snow\"). The heaviest recorded snowfall in the city center was 115 cm (45.3 inches), recorded on 15 January 1950.\nThe water temperature, like in the rest of the Black Sea coast of Turkey, is generally mild, and fluctuates between and throughout the year.\nEconomy.\nAs of 1920, the port at Trabzon was considered \"the most important of the Turkish Black Sea ports\" by the British. It traded as far as Tabriz and Mosul. As of 1911, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey signed an agreement to develop a harbor at the port. When the Russians occupied Trabzon, a mole was built. They built a breakwater and were responsible for creating an extended pier, making loading and unloading easier. In 1920, Trabzon produced linen cloth, silver filagree, tanning and small amounts of cotton, silk and wool. Tobacco and hazelnuts were exported. The tobacco produced in Trabzon was called \"Trebizond-Platana\". It was described as having \"large leaves and a bright colour.\" Trabzon was known for producing poor quality cereals, mostly for local use.\nTrabzon produced a white green bean, which was sold in Europe. It was, as of 1920, the only vegetable exported out of the province. Poultry farming was also popular in Trabzon. Sericulture was seen in the area before 1914. The area produced copper, silver, zinc, iron and manganese. Copper was kept for local use by coppersmiths. During the Balkan Wars production ceased due to poor exportation and fuel supplies.\nTrabzon Airport opened in 1957.\nPeople.\nHistory.\nTrebizond was an overwhelmingly Christian and Greek city at the time of its fall to the Ottomans in 1461. The Greek Christians slowly lost their majority through the end of that century. Initially, the Muslims were mainly immigrants from Anatolia with a minority of local converts, but this quickly changed with the emergence of an active missionary spirit in the 16th century, as mosques and dervish lodges were built in predominantly Christian neighborhoods.\nLaz people also live in Trabzon. Numerous villages inside and out of Trabzon of the Laz date back as early as the period of Queen Tamar's rule (Georgian: \u10d7\u10d0\u10db\u10d0\u10e0\u10d8, also transliterated as T'amar or Thamar; c. 1160 \u2013 18 January 1213) in the newly unified Kingdom of Georgia. During the Queen's rule, sizeable groups of immigrating Georgians moved to Trabzon where they continue to preserve their native tongue. There was an Armenian community in Trebizond as early as the 7th century.\nDuring the 13th and 14th centuries, numerous Armenian families migrated there from Ani. Robert W. Edwards published part of an early 15th-century diary from the Castilian ambassador who visited Trabzon and compared the churches of the Greek and Armenian communities. It was stated by the ambassador that the Armenians, who were not well-liked by the Greeks, had a population large enough to support a resident bishop. According to Ronald C. Jennings, in the early 16th century, Armenians made up approximately 13 percent of the city's population. At present, Trabzon does not have an Armenian-speaking community.\nThe Chepni people, a tribe of Oghuz Turks who played an important role in the history of the eastern Black Sea area in the 13th and 14th centuries, live in the \u015ealpazar\u0131 (A\u011fasar valley) region of the Trabzon Province. Very little has been written on the Turkification of the area. There are no historical records of any considerable Turkish-speaking groups in the Trabzon area until the late 15th century, with the exception of the Chepnis. The original Greek (and in some regions Armenian) speakers imposed features from their mother language into the Turkish spoken in the region. Heath W. Lowry's work with Halil \u0130nalc\u0131k on Ottoman tax books (\"Tahrir Defteri\") provides detailed demographic statistics for the city of Trabzon and its surrounding areas during the Ottoman period.\nIt is possible that the majority of the population of Trabzon and Rize (another ancient Greek colony in the Pontus region) \u2014 except up to the time of the Chepni Turk immigration waves \u2014 consisted of indigenous Caucasian tribes (the Colchians and the Laz) who had been partly Hellenized religiously and linguistically. Michael Meeker stresses the cultural resemblances (e.g. in village structure, house types, and pastoral techniques) between the Eastern Black Sea coast and the areas in the Caucasus proper.\nMain sights.\nTrabzon has a number of tourist attractions, some of them dating back to the times of the ancient empires that once existed in the region. In the city itself, one can find a hub of shops, stalls and restaurants surrounding the \"Meydan\", a square in the center of the city, which includes a tea garden.\nOther sites of the city include: Fatih Mosque (originally the Panagia Khrysokephalos Church), Yeni Cuma Mosque (originally the Agios Eugenios Church), Nakip Mosque (originally the Agios Andreas Church), H\u00fcsn\u00fc K\u00f6ktu\u011f Mosque (originally the Agios Elevtherios Church), \u0130skender Pasha Mosque, Semerciler Mosque, \u00c7ar\u015f\u0131 Mosque, G\u00fclbahar Hatun Mosque and T\u00fcrbe (commissioned by Sultan Selim I), and Kalepark (originally Leonkastron).\nWithin Trabzon Province, the main attractions are the S\u00fcmela Monastery (i.\u00a0e. the Monastery of the Panagia Soumel\u00e1) and the Uzung\u00f6l lake. The monastery is built on the side of a very steep mountain overlooking the green forests below and is about south of the city. Uzung\u00f6l is known for its natural environment and scenery. Other sites of interest in the broader region include:\nCulture.\nFolk dancing is still very much in evidence in the Black Sea Region. The \"Horon\" is a famous dance that is indigenous to the city and its surrounding area. It is performed by men, women, the young and elderly alike; in festivities, local weddings and harvest times. While similar to Russian Cossack dances in terms of vividness, the Trabzon folk dance is probably indigenous to the eastern Black Sea region, which has an impressive variety of folk music.\nThe people of Trabzon have a reputation for being religiously conservative and nationalist. Many Trabzonites generally show a strong sense of loyalty to their family, friends, religion and country. Atat\u00fcrk selected his presidential guards from Trabzon and the neighbouring city of Giresun because of their fierce fighting ability and their loyalty.\nOutside of the relatively urban space of Trabzon proper, and within parts of it as well, rural traditions from the Black Sea village life are still thriving. These include traditional gender roles, social conservatism, hospitality, and a willingness to help strangers; and all aspects, both positive and negative, of an agrarian lifestyle, such as hard work, poverty, strong family ties, and a closeness to nature.\nThe people of the eastern Black Sea region are also known for their wit and sense of humour; many jokes in Turkey are told about the natives of the Black Sea region \"Karadeniz f\u0131kralar\u0131\" (Black Sea jokes). The character \"Temel\", a universal buffoon figure found in many cultures, forms an important part of the Turkish oral tradition.\nThe city's profile was raised somewhat in the English-speaking world by Dame Rose Macaulay's last novel, \"The Towers of Trebizond\" (1956), which is still in print.\nEducation.\nKaradeniz Technical University in Trabzon hosts students from all over Turkey, especially from the Black Sea and East Anatolian regions, as well as students from the Turkic states in Central Asia.\nHistorically the city was a center of Greek culture and education and from 1683 to 1921, a teachers' college operated known as Phrontisterion of Trapezous, which provided a major impetus for the rapid expansion of Greek education throughout the region. The building of this institution (built in 1902) still remains the most impressive Pontic Greek monument in the city and today hosts the Turkish school \"Anadolu Lisesi\".\nCuisine.\nTrabzon's regional cuisine is traditionally reliant on fish, especially \"hamsi\" (fresh European Anchovy similar to the British Sprat or American Smelt). Trabzon meets 20% of the total fish production in Turkey. Regional dishes include the \"Ak\u00e7aabat k\u00f6fte\" (spicy lamb meatball from the Ak\u00e7aabat district), \"Karadeniz pidesi\" (canoe shaped pita bread, often filled with ground beef, cheese and eggs), \"kuymak\" (a Turkish fondue made with cornmeal, fresh butter and cheese), \"Vakf\u0131kebir ekme\u011fi\" (large country-style bread), \"Tonya tereya\u011f\u0131\" (Tonya butter), \"tava m\u0131s\u0131r ekme\u011fi\" (deep-dish corn bread) and \"kara lahana \u00e7orbas\u0131\" (bean and cabbage soup). \"Taflan kavurmas\u0131\" is a cherry laurel dish served with onions and olive oil. Trabzon is also famous for its hazelnuts. The Black Sea region of Turkey is the world's largest producer of cherry and hazelnut; and a large production area of tea; all of which play an important role in the local cuisine.\nSports.\nFootball is the most popular sport in Trabzon. The city's top sports club, Trabzonspor, was until 2010 the only Turkish football club outside \u0130stanbul to win the S\u00fcper Lig (six times), which was previously (until Trabzonspor's first championship title in the 1975\u201376 season) won only by the \"Big Three\" clubs of Istanbul, namely Galatasaray, Fenerbah\u00e7e, and Be\u015fikta\u015f. Due to Trabzonspor's success, the decades-old term \"Big Three\" which defined the most successful football clubs in Turkey had to be modified into the \"Big Four\".\nTrabzonspor is also one of the most successful Turkish clubs in the European Cups, managing to beat numerous prominent teams such as Barcelona, Inter, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Monaco, and Lyon. Renowned former players of Trabzonspor include \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f, Lars Olsen and Shota Arveladze. In the 2021\u20132022 season, Trabzonspor left their Istanbul competition far behind, securing an early championship and ending a 38-year dry streak. Hundreds of thousands Trabzonite expatriates and fans from around the globe made their way to the city to participate in one of the first mass gatherings in the country for nearly two years, marking the end of the Corona pandemic. Officially the pandemic-measures had not been fully lifted, which led to some criticism towards the city's municipal government for allowing the festivities to continue for hours into the night, long past curfew.\nTrabzon hosted the first edition of the Black Sea Games in July 2007 and the 2011 European Youth Summer Olympic Festival.\nBuilt in 2017, a two-lane Trabzon Curling Hall is situated under stadium of the \u015eenol G\u00fcne\u015f Sports Complex.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns - sister cities.\nTrabzon is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nDrohgheda, Ireland"}
{"id": "62654", "revid": "36878010", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62654", "title": "The Taming of the Shrew", "text": "Play by William Shakespeare\nThe Taming of the Shrew is a comedy by William Shakespeare written between 1590 and 1592. The play begins with a framing device, often referred to as the induction, in which a mischievous nobleman tricks a drunken tinker named Christopher Sly into believing he is actually a nobleman himself. The nobleman then has the play performed for Sly's diversion.\nThe main plot depicts the courtship of Petruchio and Katherina, the headstrong, obdurate shrew. Initially, Katherina is an unwilling participant in the relationship; however, Petruchio \"tames\" her with various psychological and physical torments, such as keeping her from eating and drinking, until she becomes a desirable, compliant, and obedient bride. The subplot features a competition among the suitors of Katherina's younger sister, Bianca, who is seen as the \"ideal\" woman. The question of whether the play is misogynistic has become the subject of considerable controversy.\n\"The Taming of the Shrew\" has been adapted numerous times for stage, screen, opera, ballet, and musical theatre, perhaps the most famous adaptations being Cole Porter's \"Kiss Me, Kate\"; \"McLintock!\", a 1963 American Western comedy film, starring John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara; and the 1967 film of the play, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. The 1999 high-school comedy film \"10 Things I Hate About You\" and the 2003 romantic comedy \"Deliver Us from Eva\" are also loosely based on the play.\nCharacters.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\n\"Characters appearing in the Induction:\"\nSynopsis.\nPrior to the first act, an induction frames the play as a \"kind of history\" played in front of a befuddled drunkard named Christopher Sly who is tricked into believing that he is a lord. The play is performed in order to distract Sly from his \"wife,\" who is actually Bartholomew, a servant, dressed as a woman.\nIn the play performed for Sly, the \"shrew\" is Katherina, the elder daughter of Baptista Minola, a lord in Padua. Numerous men, including Tranio, deem Katherina an unworthy option for marriage because of her notorious assertiveness and willfulness. On the other hand, men such as Hortensio and Gremio are eager to marry her younger sister Bianca. However, Baptista has sworn Bianca is not allowed to marry until Katherina is wed; this motivates Bianca's suitors to work together to find Katherina a husband so that they may compete for Bianca. The plot thickens when Lucentio, who has recently come to Padua to attend university, falls in love with Bianca. Overhearing Baptista say that he is on the lookout for tutors for his daughters, Lucentio devises a plan in which he disguises himself as a Latin tutor named Cambio in order to woo Bianca behind Baptista's back and meanwhile has his servant Tranio pretend to be him.\nIn the meantime, Petruchio, accompanied by his servant Grumio, arrives in Padua from Verona. He explains to Hortensio, an old friend of his, that since his father's death, he has set out to enjoy life and wed. Hearing this, Hortensio recruits Petruchio as a suitor for Katherina. He also has Petruchio present him (Hortensio) to Baptista disguised as a music tutor named Litio. Thus, Lucentio and Hortensio attempt to woo Bianca while pretending to be the tutors Cambio and Litio respectively.\nTo counter Katherina's shrewish nature, Petruchio pretends that any harsh things she says or does are actually kind and gentle. Katherina agrees to marry Petruchio after seeing that he is the only man willing to counter her quick remarks; however, at the ceremony, Petruchio makes an embarrassing scene when he strikes the priest and drinks the communion wine. After the wedding, Petruchio takes Katherina to his home against her will. Once they are gone, Gremio and Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) formally bid for Bianca, with Tranio easily outbidding Gremio. However, in his zeal to win, he promises much more than Lucentio possesses. When Baptista determines that once Lucentio's father confirms the dowry, Bianca and Tranio (i.e., Lucentio) can marry, Tranio decides that they will need someone to pretend to be Vincentio, Lucentio's father. Meanwhile, Tranio persuades Hortensio that Bianca is not worthy of his attention, thus removing Lucentio's remaining rival.\nIn Verona, Petruchio begins the \"taming\" of his new wife. She is refused food and clothing because nothing \u2013 according to Petruchio \u2013 is good enough for her; he claims that perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything that she says, forcing her to agree with everything that he says, no matter how absurd; on their way back to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims \"if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me\" (4.5.14\u201315). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her that he is a man.\nBack in Padua, Lucentio and Tranio convince a passing pedant to pretend to be Vincentio and confirm the dowry for Bianca. The man does so, and Baptista is happy for Bianca to wed Lucentio (still Tranio in disguise). Bianca, aware of the deception, then secretly elopes with the real Lucentio to get married. However, when Vincentio reaches Padua, he encounters the pedant, who claims to be Lucentio's father. Tranio (still disguised as Lucentio) appears, and the pedant acknowledges him to be his son Lucentio. In all the confusion, the real Vincentio is set to be arrested, when the real Lucentio appears with his newly betrothed Bianca, revealing all to a bewildered Baptista and Vincentio. Lucentio explains everything, and all is forgiven by the two fathers.\nMeanwhile, Hortensio has married a rich widow. In the final scene of the play, there are three newly married couples: Bianca and Lucentio, the widow and Hortensio, and Katherina and Petruchio. Because of the general opinion that Petruchio is married to a shrew, a good-natured quarrel breaks out amongst the three men about whose wife is the most obedient. Petruchio proposes a wager whereby each will send a servant to call for his wife, and whichever comes most obediently will have won the wager for her husband. Katherina is the only one of the three who comes, winning the wager for Petruchio. She then hauls the other two wives into the room, giving a speech on why wives should always obey their husbands. The play ends with Baptista, Hortensio and Lucentio marvelling at how successfully Petruchio has tamed the shrew.\nSources.\nAlthough there is no direct literary source for the induction, the tale of a commoner being duped into believing he is a lord is one found in many literary traditions. Such a story is recorded in \"Arabian Nights\" where Harun al-Rashid plays the same trick on a man he finds sleeping in an alley. Another is found in \"De Rebus Burgundicis\" (1584) by the Dutch historian Pontus de Huyter, where Philip, Duke of Burgundy, after attending his sister's wedding in Portugal, finds a drunken \"artisan\" whom he entertains with a \"pleasant Comedie.\" \"Arabian Nights\" was not translated into English until the mid-18th century, although Shakespeare may have known it by word of mouth. He could also have known about the Duke of Burgundy story because although \"De Rebus\" was not translated into French until 1600 and not into English until 1607, there is evidence the story existed in English in a jest book (now lost) by Richard Edwardes, written in 1570.\nRegarding the Petruchio/Katherina story, there are a variety of possible influences, but no one specific source. The basic elements of the narrative are present in tale 35 of the fourteenth-century Spanish book \"Libro de los ejemplos del conde Lucanor y de Patronio\" by Don Juan Manuel, which tells of a young man who marries a \"very strong and fiery woman.\" The text had been translated into English by the sixteenth century, but there is no evidence that Shakespeare drew on it. The story of a headstrong woman tamed by a man was well known, and found in numerous traditions. For example, according to \"The Canterbury Tales\" by Geoffrey Chaucer, Noah's wife was such a woman ('\"Hastow nought herd,\" quod Nicholas, \"also/The sorwe of No\u00eb with his felaschippe/That he had or he gat his wyf to schipe\"'; \"The Miller's Tale\", l. 352\u2013354), and it was common for her to be depicted in this manner in mystery plays. Historically, another such woman was Xanthippe, Socrates' wife, who is mentioned by Petruchio himself (1.2.70). Such characters also occur throughout medieval literature, in popular farces both before and during Shakespeare's lifetime and in folklore.\nIn 1890, Alfred Tolman conjectured a possible literary source for the wager scene may have been William Caxton's 1484 translation of Geoffroy IV de la Tour Landry's \"Livre pour l'enseignement de ses filles du Chevalier de La Tour Landry\" (1372). Written for his daughters as a guide on how to behave appropriately, de la Tour Landry includes \"a treatise on the domestic education of women\" which features an anecdote in which three merchants make a wager as to which of their wives will prove the most obedient when called upon to jump into a basin of water. The episode sees the first two wives refuse to obey (as in the play), it ends at a banquet (as does the play) and it features a speech regarding the \"correct\" way for a husband to discipline his wife. In 1959, John W. Shroeder conjectured that \"Chevalier de La Tour Landry\"'s depiction of the Queen Vastis story may also have been an influence on Shakespeare.\nIn 1964, Richard Hosley suggested the main source for the play may have been the anonymous ballad \"A merry jeste of a shrewde and curst Wyfe, lapped in Morrelles Skin, for her good behauyour\". The ballad tells the story of a marriage in which the husband must tame his headstrong wife. Like \"Shrew\", the story features a family with two sisters, the younger of whom is seen as mild and desirable. However, in \"Merry Jest\", the older sister is obdurate not because it is simply her nature, but because she has been raised by her shrewish mother to seek mastery over men. Ultimately, the couple returns to the family house, where the now-tamed woman lectures her sister on the merits of being an obedient wife. The taming in this version is much more physical than in Shakespeare; the shrew is beaten with birch rods until she bleeds and is then wrapped in the salted flesh of a plough horse (the Morrelle of the title). \"Merry Jest\" was not unknown to earlier editors of the play, and had been dismissed as a source by A.R. Frey, W.C. Hazlitt, R. Warwick Bond and Frederick S. Boas. Modern editors also express doubt as to Hosley's argument.\nIn 1966, Jan Harold Brunvand argued that the main source for the play was not literary, but the oral folktale tradition. He argued the Petruchio/Katherina story represents an example of Type 901 ('Shrew-taming Complex') in the Aarne\u2013Thompson classification system. Brunvand discovered 383 oral examples of Type 901 spread over thirty European countries, but he could find only 35 literary examples, leading him to conclude that \"Shakespeare's taming plot, which has not been traced successfully in its entirety to any known printed version, must have come ultimately from oral tradition.\" Most contemporary critics accept Brunvand's findings.\nA source for Shakespeare's subplot was first identified by Alfred Tolman in 1890 as Ludovico Ariosto's \"I Suppositi\", which was published in 1551. George Gascoigne's English prose translation \"Supposes\" was performed in 1566 and printed in 1573. In \"I Suppositi\", Erostrato (the equivalent of Lucentio) falls in love with Polynesta (Bianca), daughter of Damon (Baptista). Erostrato disguises himself as Dulipo (Tranio), a servant, whilst the real Dulipo pretends to be Erostrato. Having done this, Erostrato is hired as a tutor for Polynesta. Meanwhile, Dulipo pretends to formally woo Polynesta so as to frustrate the wooing of the aged Cleander (Gremio). Dulipo outbids Cleander, but he promises far more than he can deliver, so he and Erostrato dupe a travelling gentleman from Siena into pretending to be Erostrato's father, Philogano (Vincentio). However, when Polynesta is found to be pregnant, Damon has Dulipo imprisoned (the real father is Erostrato). Soon thereafter, the real Philogano arrives, and all comes to a head. Erostrato reveals himself, and begs clemency for Dulipo. Damon realises that Polynesta is truly in love with Erostrato, and so forgives the subterfuge. Having been released from jail, Dulipo then discovers he is Cleander's son. An additional minor source is \"Mostellaria\" by Plautus, from which Shakespeare probably took the names of Tranio and Grumio.\nDate and text.\nDate.\nEfforts to date the play's composition are complicated by its uncertain relationship with another Elizabethan play entitled \"A Pleasant Conceited Historie, called the taming of a Shrew\", which has an almost identical plot but different wording and character names. \"The Shrew\"'s exact relationship with \"A Shrew\" is unknown. Different theories suggest \"A Shrew\" could be a reported text of a performance of \"The Shrew\", a source for \"The Shrew\", an early draft (possibly reported) of \"The Shrew\", or an adaptation of \"The Shrew\". \"A Shrew\" was entered in the Stationers' Register on 2 May 1594, suggesting that whatever the relationship between the two plays, \"The Shrew\" was most likely written somewhere between 1590 (roughly when Shakespeare arrived in London) and 1594 (registration of \"A Shrew\").\nSome writers suggest, that it is possible to narrow the date further. A \"terminus ante quem\" for \"A Shrew\" could be August 1592, as a stage direction at 3.21 mentions \"Simon,\" which probably refers to the actor Simon Jewell, who was buried on 21 August 1592. Furthermore, \"The Shrew\" seems to have been written earlier than 1593, as Anthony Chute's \"Beauty Dishonoured, written under the title of Shore's wife\" (published in June 1593) contains the line \"He calls his Kate, and she must come and kiss him.\" This must refer to \"The Shrew\", as there is no corresponding \"kissing scene\" in \"A Shrew\". There are also verbal similarities between both \"Shrew\" plays and the anonymous play \"A Knack To Know A Knave\" (first performed at The Rose on 10 June 1592). \"Knack\" features several passages common to both \"A Shrew\" and \"The Shrew\", but it also borrows several passages unique to \"The Shrew\". This suggests \"The Shrew\" was on stage prior to June 1592.\nIn his 1982 edition of the play for The Oxford Shakespeare, H.J. Oliver suggests the play was composed no later than 1592. He bases this on the title page of \"A Shrew\", which mentions the play had been performed \"sundry times\" by Pembroke's Men. When the London theatres were closed on 23 June 1592 due to an outbreak of plague, Pembroke's Men went on a regional tour to Bath and Ludlow. The tour was a financial failure, and the company returned to London on 28 September, financially ruined. Over the next three years, four plays with their name on the title page were published; Christopher Marlowe's \"Edward II\" (published in quarto in July 1593), and Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\" (published in quarto in 1594), \"The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of York\" (published in octavo in 1595) and \"The Taming of a Shrew\" (published in quarto in May 1594). Oliver says it is a \"natural assumption\" that these publications were sold by members of Pembroke's Men who were broke after the failed tour. Oliver assumes that \"A Shrew\" is a reported version of \"The Shrew\", which means \"The Shrew\" must have been in their possession when they began their tour in June, as they didn't perform it upon returning to London in September, nor would they have taken possession of any new material at that time.\nAnn Thompson considers \"A Shrew\" to be a reported text in her 1984 and 2003 editions of the play for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. She focuses on the closure of the theatres on 23 June 1592, arguing that the play must have been written prior to June 1592 for it to have given rise to \"A Shrew\". She cites the reference to \"Simon\" in \"A Shrew\", Anthony Chute's allusion to \"The Shrew\" in \"Beauty Dishonoured\" and the verbal similarities between \"The Shrew\" and \"A Knack to Know a Knave\" as supporting a date of composition prior to June 1592. Stephen Roy Miller, in his 1998 edition of \"A Shrew\" for the New Cambridge Shakespeare, agrees with the date of late 1591/early 1592, as he believes \"The Shrew\" preceded \"A Shrew\" (although he rejects the reported text theory in favour of an adaptation/rewrite theory). In \"William Shakespeare: A Textual Companion\" Gary Taylor argues for a date of composition around 1590\u20131591, noting much of the same evidence cited by other scholars but acknowledging the difficulty of dating the play with certainty.\nKeir Elam, however, has argued for a \"terminus post quem\" of 1591 for \"The Shrew\", based on Shakespeare's probable use of two sources published that year: Abraham Ortelius' map of Italy in the fourth edition of \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\", and John Florio's \"Second Fruits\". Firstly, Shakespeare errs in putting Padua in Lombardy instead of Veneto, probably because he used Ortelius' map of Italy as a source, which has \"Lombardy\" written across the entirety of northern Italy. Secondly, Elam suggests that Shakespeare derived his Italian idioms and some of the dialogue from Florio's \"Second Fruits\", a bilingual introduction to Italian language and culture. Elam argues that Lucentio's opening dialogue,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nTranio, since for the great desire I had\nTo see fair Padua, nursery of arts,\nI am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,\nThe pleasant garden of great Italy.\n(1.1.1\u20134)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nis an example of Shakespeare's borrowing from Florio's dialogue between Peter and Stephan, who have just arrived in the north:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"PETER\"\nI purpose to stay a while, to view the fair Cities of Lombardy.\n\"STEPHAN\"\nLombardy is the garden of the world.\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nElam's arguments suggest \"The Shrew\" must have been written no earlier than 1591, which places the date of composition around 1591\u20131592.\nText.\nThe 1594 quarto of \"A Shrew\" was printed by Peter Short for Cuthbert Burbie. It was republished in 1596 (again by Short for Burbie), and 1607 by Valentine Simmes for Nicholas Ling. \"The Shrew\" was not published until the \"First Folio\" in 1623. The only quarto version of \"The Shrew\" was printed by William Stansby for John Smethwick in 1631 as \"A Wittie and Pleasant comedie called The Taming of the Shrew\", based on the 1623 folio text. W.W. Greg has demonstrated that \"A Shrew\" and \"The Shrew\" were treated as the same text for the purposes of copyright, i.e. ownership of one constituted ownership of the other, and when Smethwick purchased the rights from Ling in 1609 to print the play in the \"First Folio\", Ling actually transferred the rights for \"A Shrew\", not \"The Shrew\". This has led Darren Freebury-Jones to contend that Shakespeare's play was originally titled \"A Shrew\" but that the Folio compilers altered the title to distinguish it from what he sees as an adaptation.\nAnalysis and criticism.\nCritical history.\nThe relationship with \"A Shrew\".\nOne of the most fundamental critical debates surrounding \"The Shrew\" is its relationship with a separate play, \"A Shrew\". There are five main theories as to the nature of this relationship:\nThe exact relationship between \"The Shrew\" and \"A Shrew\" is uncertain, but many scholars consider \"The Shrew\" the original, with \"A Shrew\" derived from it; as H.J. Oliver suggests, there are \"passages in [\"A Shrew\"] [...] that make sense only if one knows the [Follio] version from which they must have been derived.\"\nThe debate regarding the relationship between the two plays began in 1725, when Alexander Pope incorporated extracts from \"A Shrew\" into \"The Shrew\" in his edition of Shakespeare's works. In \"The Shrew\", the Christopher Sly framework is only featured twice; at the opening of the play, and at the end of Act 1, Scene 1. However, in \"A Shrew\", the Sly framework reappears a further five times, including a scene which comes after the final scene of the Petruchio/Katherina story. Pope added most of the Sly framework to \"The Shrew\", even though he acknowledged in his preface that he did not believe Shakespeare had written \"A Shrew\". Subsequent editors followed suit, adding some or all of the Sly framework to their versions of \"The Shrew\"; Lewis Theobald (1733), Thomas Hanmer (1744), William Warburton (1747), Samuel Johnson and George Steevens (1765) and Edward Capell (1768). In his 1790 edition of \"The Plays and Poems of William Shakespeare\", however, Edmond Malone removed all \"A Shrew\" extracts and returned the text to the 1623 \"First Folio\" version. By the end of the eighteenth century, the predominant theory had come to be that \"A Shrew\" was a non-Shakespearean source for \"The Shrew\", and hence to include extracts from it was to graft non-authorial material onto the play.\nThis theory prevailed until 1850 when Samuel Hickson compared the texts of \"The Shrew\" and \"A Shrew\", concluding \"The Shrew\" was the original, and \"A Shrew\" was derived from it. By comparing seven passages which are similar in both plays, he concluded \"the original conception is invariably to be found\" in \"The Shrew\". His explanation was that \"A Shrew\" was written by Christopher Marlowe, with \"The Shrew\" as his template. He reached this conclusion primarily because \"A Shrew\" features numerous lines almost identical to lines in Marlowe's \"Tamburlaine\" and \"Dr. Faustus\".\nIn 1926, building on Hickson's research, Peter Alexander first suggested the bad quarto theory. Alexander agreed with Hickson that \"A Shrew\" was derived from \"The Shrew\", but he did not agree that Marlowe wrote \"A Shrew\". Instead, he labelled \"A Shrew\" a bad quarto. His main argument was that, primarily in the subplot of \"A Shrew\", characters act without motivation, whereas such motivation is present in \"The Shrew\". Alexander believed this represents an example of a \"reporter\" forgetting details and becoming confused, which also explains why lines from other plays are used from time to time; to cover gaps which the reporter knows have been left. He also argued the subplot in \"The Shrew\" was closer to the plot of \"I Suppositi\"/\"Supposes\" than the subplot in \"A Shrew\", which he felt indicated the subplot in \"The Shrew\" must have been based directly on the source, whereas the subplot in \"A Shrew\" was a step removed. In their 1928 edition of the play for the New Shakespeare, Arthur Quiller-Couch and John Dover Wilson supported Alexander's argument. However, there has always been critical resistance to the theory.\nAn early scholar to find fault with Alexander's reasoning was E.K. Chambers, who reasserted the source theory. Chambers, who supported Alexander's bad quarto theory regarding \"The First part of the Contention betwixt the two famous Houses of Yorke and Lancaster\" and \"The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke\", argued \"A Shrew\" did not fit the pattern of a bad quarto; \"I am quite unable to believe that \"A Shrew\" had any such origin. Its textual relation to \"The Shrew\" does not bear any analogy to that of other 'bad Quartos' to the legitimate texts from which they were memorised. The nomenclature, which at least a memoriser can recall, is entirely different. The verbal parallels are limited to stray phrases, most frequent in the main plot, for which I believe Shakespeare picked them up from \"A Shrew\".\" He explained the relationship between \"I Suppositi\"/\"Supposes\" and the subplots by arguing the subplot in \"The Shrew\" was based upon both the subplot in \"A Shrew\" and the original version of the story in Ariosto/Gascoigne.\nIn 1938, Leo Kirschbaum made a similar argument. In an article listing over twenty examples of bad quartos, Kirschbaum did not include \"A Shrew\", which he felt was too different from \"The Shrew\" to come under the bad quarto banner; \"despite protestations to the contrary, \"The Taming of a Shrew\" does not stand in relation to \"The Shrew\" as \"The True Tragedie\", for example, stands in relation to \"3 Henry VI\".\" Writing in 1998, Stephen Roy Miller offers much the same opinion; \"the relation of the early quarto to the \"Folio\" text is unlike other early quartos because the texts vary much more in plotting and dialogue [...] the differences between the texts are substantial and coherent enough to establish that there was deliberate revision in producing one text out of the other; hence \"A Shrew\" is not merely a poor report (or 'bad quarto') of \"The Shrew\".\" Character names are changed, basic plot points are altered (Kate has two sisters for example, not one), the play is set in Athens instead of Padua, the Sly framework forms a complete narrative, and entire speeches are completely different, all of which suggests to Miller that the author of \"A Shrew\" thought they were working on something different from Shakespeare's play, not attempting to transcribe it for resale; \"underpinning the notion of a 'Shakespearean bad quarto' is the assumption that the motive of whoever compiled that text was to produce, differentially, a verbal replica of what appeared on stage.\" Miller believes that Chambers and Kirschbaum successfully illustrate \"A Shrew\" does not fulfil this rubric.\nAlexander's theory continued to be challenged as the years went on. In 1942, R.A. Houk developed what came to be dubbed the \"Ur-Shrew\" theory; both \"A Shrew\" and \"The Shrew\" were based upon a third play, now lost. In 1943, G.I. Duthie refined Houk's suggestion by arguing \"A Shrew\" was a memorial reconstruction of \"Ur-Shrew\", a now lost early draft of \"The Shrew\"; \"\"A Shrew\" is substantially a memorially constructed text and is dependent upon an early \"Shrew\" play, now lost. \"The Shrew\" is a reworking of this lost play.\" Hickson, who believed Marlowe to have written \"A Shrew\", had hinted at this theory in 1850; \"though I do not believe Shakspeare's play to contain a line of any other writer, I think it extremely probable that we have it only in a revised form, and that, consequently, the play which Marlowe imitated might not necessarily have been that fund of life and humour that we find it now.\" Hickson is here arguing that Marlowe's \"A Shrew\" is not based upon the version of \"The Shrew\" found in the \"First Folio\", but on another version of the play. Duthie argues this other version was a Shakespearean early draft of \"The Shrew\"; \"A Shrew\" constitutes a reported text of a now lost early draft.\nAlexander returned to the debate in 1969, re-presenting his bad quarto theory. In particular, he concentrated on the various complications and inconsistencies in the subplot of \"A Shrew\", which had been used by Houk and Duthie as evidence for an \"Ur-Shrew\", to argue that the reporter of \"A Shrew\" attempted to recreate the complex subplot from \"The Shrew\" but got confused; \"the compiler of \"A Shrew\" while trying to follow the subplot of \"The Shrew\" gave it up as too complicated to reproduce, and fell back on love scenes in which he substituted for the maneuvers of the disguised Lucentio and Hortensio extracts from \"Tamburlaine\" and \"Faustus\", with which the lovers woo their ladies.\"\nAfter little further discussion of the issue in the 1970s, the 1980s saw the publication of three scholarly editions of \"The Shrew\", all of which re-addressed the question of the relationship between the two plays; Brian Morris' 1981 edition for the second series of the Arden Shakespeare, H.J. Oliver's 1982 edition for the Oxford Shakespeare and Ann Thompson's 1984 edition for the New Cambridge Shakespeare. Morris summarised the scholarly position in 1981 as one in which no clear-cut answers could be found; \"unless new, external evidence comes to light, the relationship between \"The Shrew\" and \"A Shrew\" can never be decided beyond a peradventure. It will always be a balance of probabilities, shifting as new arguments and opinions are added to the scales. Nevertheless, in the present century, the movement has unquestionably been towards an acceptance of the Bad Quarto theory, and this can now be accepted as at least the current orthodoxy.\" Morris himself, and Thompson, supported the bad quarto theory, with Oliver tentatively arguing for Duthie's bad quarto/early draft/\"Ur-Shrew\" theory.\nPerhaps the most extensive examination of the question came in 1998 in Stephen Roy Miller's edition of \"A Shrew\" for the New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos series. Miller agrees with most modern scholars that \"A Shrew\" is derived from \"The Shrew\", but he does not believe it to be a bad quarto. Instead, he argues it is an adaptation by someone other than Shakespeare. Miller believes Alexander's suggestion in 1969 that the reporter became confused is unlikely, and instead suggests an adapter at work; \"the most economic explanation of indebtedness is that whoever compiled \"A Shrew\" borrowed the lines from Shakespeare's \"The Shrew\", or a version of it, and adapted them.\" Part of Miller's evidence relates to Gremio, who has no counterpart in \"A Shrew\". In \"The Shrew\", after the wedding, Gremio expresses doubts as to whether or not Petruchio will be able to tame Katherina. In \"A Shrew\", these lines are extended and split between Polidor (the equivalent of Hortensio) and Phylema (Bianca). As Gremio \"does\" have a counterpart in \"I Suppositi\", Miller concludes that \"to argue the priority of \"A Shrew\" in this case would mean arguing that Shakespeare took the negative hints from the speeches of Polidor and Phylema and gave them to a character he resurrected from \"Supposes\". This is a less economical argument than to suggest that the compiler of \"A Shrew\", dismissing Gremio, simply shared his doubts among the characters available.\" He argues there is even evidence in the play that the compiler knew he was working within a specific literary tradition; \"as with his partial change of character names, the compiler seems to wish to produce dialogue much like his models, but not the same. For him, adaptation includes exact quotation, imitation and incorporation of his own additions. This seems to define his personal style, and his aim seems to be to produce his own version, presumably intended that it should be tuned more towards the popular era than \"The Shrew\".\"\nAs had Alexander, Houk and Duthie, Miller believes the key to the debate is to be found in the subplot, as it is here where the two plays differ most. He points out that the subplot in \"The Shrew\" is based on \"the classical style of Latin comedy with an intricate plot involving deception, often kept in motion by a comic servant.\" The subplot in \"A Shrew\", however, which features an extra sister and addresses the issue of marrying above and below one's class, \"has many elements more associated with the romantic style of comedy popular in London in the 1590s.\" Miller cites plays such as Robert Greene's \"Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay\" and \"Fair Em\" as evidence of the popularity of such plays. He points to the fact that in \"The Shrew\", there are only eleven lines of romance between Lucentio and Bianca, but in \"A Shrew\", there is an entire scene between Kate's two sisters and their lovers. This, he argues, is evidence of an adaptation rather than a faulty report;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;while it is difficult to know the motivation of the adapter, we can reckon that from his point of view an early staging of \"The Shrew\" might have revealed an overly wrought play from a writer trying to establish himself but challenging too far the current ideas of popular comedy. \"The Shrew\" is long and complicated. It has three plots, the subplots being in the swift Latin or Italianate style with several disguises. Its language is at first stuffed with difficult Italian quotations, but its dialogue must often sound plain when compared to Marlowe's thunder or Greene's romance, the mouth-filling lines and images that on other afternoons were drawing crowds. An adapter might well have seen his role as that of a 'play doctor' improving \"The Shrew\" \u2013 while cutting it \u2013 by stuffing it with the sort of material currently in demand in popular romantic comedies.\nMiller believes the compiler \"appears to have wished to make the play shorter, more of a romantic comedy full of wooing and glamorous rhetoric, and to add more obvious, broad comedy.\"\nHortensio problem.\nH.J. Oliver argues the version of the play in the 1623 \"First Folio\" was likely copied not from a prompt book or transcript, but from the author's own foul papers, which he believes showed signs of revision by Shakespeare. These revisions, Oliver says, relate primarily to the character of Hortensio, and suggest that in an original version of the play, now lost, Hortensio was not a suitor to Bianca, but simply an old friend of Petruchio. When Shakespeare rewrote the play so that Hortensio became a suitor in disguise (Litio), many of his lines were either omitted or given to Tranio (disguised as Lucentio).\nOliver cites several scenes in the play where Hortensio (or his absence) causes problems. For example, in Act 2, Scene 1, Tranio (as Lucentio) and Gremio bid for Bianca, but Hortensio, who everyone is aware is also a suitor, is never mentioned. In Act 3, Scene 1, Lucentio (as Cambio) tells Bianca \"we might beguile the old Pantalowne\" (l.36), yet says nothing of Hortensio's attempts to woo her, instead implying his only rival is Gremio. In Act 3, Scene 2, Tranio suddenly becomes an old friend of Petruchio, knowing his mannerisms and explaining his tardiness prior to the wedding. However, up to this point, Petruchio's only acquaintance in Padua has been Hortensio. In Act 4, Scene 3, Hortensio tells Vincentio that Lucentio has married Bianca. However, as far as Hortensio should be concerned, Lucentio has denounced Bianca, because in Act 4, Scene 2, Tranio (disguised as Lucentio) agreed with Hortensio that neither of them would pursue Bianca, and as such, his knowledge of the marriage of who he supposes to be Lucentio and Bianca makes little sense. From this, Oliver concludes that an original version of the play existed in which Hortensio was simply a friend of Petruchio's, and had no involvement in the Bianca subplot, but wishing to complicate things, Shakespeare rewrote the play, introducing the Litio disguise, and giving some of Hortensio's discarded lines to Tranio, but not fully correcting everything to fit the presence of a new suitor.\nThis is important in Duthie's theory of an \"Ur-Shrew\" insofar as he argues it is the original version of \"The Shrew\" upon which \"A Shrew\" is based, not the version which appears in the 1623 \"First Folio\". As Oliver argues, \"\"A Shrew\" is a report of an earlier, Shakespearian, form of \"The Shrew\" in which Hortensio was not disguised as Litio.\" Oliver suggests that when Pembroke's Men left London in June 1592, they had in their possession a now-lost early draft of the play. Upon returning to London, they published \"A Shrew\" in 1594, sometime after which Shakespeare rewrote his original play into the form seen in the \"First Folio\".\nDuthie's arguments were never fully accepted at the time, as critics tended to look at the relationship between the two plays as an either-or situation; \"A Shrew\" is \"either\" a reported text \"or\" an early draft. In more recent scholarship, however, the possibility that a text could be both has been shown to be critically viable. For example, in his 2003 Oxford Shakespeare edition of \"2 Henry VI\", Roger Warren makes the same argument for \"The First Part of the Contention\". Randall Martin reaches the same conclusion regarding \"The True Tragedy of Richard Duke of Yorke\" in his 2001 Oxford Shakespeare edition of \"3 Henry VI\". This lends support to the theory that \"A Shrew\" could be both a reported text and an early draft.\nSexism controversy.\n\"The Taming of the Shrew\" has been the subject of critical controversy. Dana Aspinall writes \"Since its first appearance, some time between 1588 and 1594, \"Shrew\" has elicited a panoply of heartily supportive, ethically uneasy, or altogether disgusted responses to its rough-and-tumble treatment of the 'taming' of the 'curst shrew' Katherina, and obviously, of all potentially unruly wives.\" Phyllis Rackin argues that \"seen in the context of current anxieties, desires and beliefs, Shakespeare's play seems to prefigure the most oppressive modern assumptions about women and to validate those assumptions as timeless truths.\" Stevie Davies says that responses to \"Shrew\" have been \"dominated by feelings of unease and embarrassment, accompanied by the desire to prove that Shakespeare cannot have meant what he seems to be saying; and that therefore he cannot really be saying it.\" Philippa Kelly asks:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Do we simply add our voices to those of critical disapproval, seeing \"Shrew\" as at best an \"early Shakespeare\", the socially provocative effort of a dramatist who was learning to flex his muscles? Or as an item of social archaeology that we have long ago abandoned? Or do we \"rescue\" it from offensive male smugness? Or make an appeal to the slippery category of \"irony\"?\nSome scholars argue that even in Shakespeare's day the play must have been controversial, due to the changing nature of gender politics. Marjorie Garber, for example, suggests Shakespeare created the Induction so the audience would not react badly to the misogyny in the Petruchio/Katherina story; he was, in effect, defending himself against charges of sexism. G.R. Hibbard argues that during the period in which the play was written, arranged marriages were beginning to give way to newer, more romantically informed unions, and thus people's views on women's position in society, and their relationships with men, were in a state of flux. As such, audiences may not have been as predisposed to tolerate the harsh treatment of Katherina as is often thought.\nEvidence of at least some initial societal discomfort with \"The Shrew\" is, perhaps, to be found in the fact that John Fletcher, Shakespeare's successor as house playwright for the King's Men, wrote \"The Woman's Prize, or The Tamer Tamed\" as a sequel to Shakespeare's play. Written \"c.\"1611, the play tells the story of Petruchio's remarriage after Katherina's death. In a mirror of the original, his new wife attempts (successfully) to tame him \u2013 thus the tamer becomes the tamed. Although Fletcher's sequel is often downplayed as merely a farce, some critics acknowledge the more serious implications of such a reaction. Lynda Boose, for example, writes, \"Fletcher's response may in itself reflect the kind of discomfort that \"Shrew\" has characteristically provoked in men and why its many revisions since 1594 have repeatedly contrived ways of softening the edges.\"\nWith the rise of the feminist movement in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, \"Kate's taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw's words 'altogether disgusting to modern sensibility'.\" Addressing the relationship between \"A Shrew\" and \"The Shrew\" from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to be what it seems. She argues \"A Shrew\" is an earlier version of \"The Shrew\", but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that \"A Shrew\" was written by Shakespeare. She believes one of the reasons for this is because \"A Shrew\" \"hedges the play's patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in\" \"The Shrew\". She calls \"A Shrew\" a more \"progressive\" text than \"The Shrew\", and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that \"A Shrew\" is Shakespearean because \"the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in \"The Shrew\".\" She also points out that if \"A Shrew\" is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare \"may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials\", something which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.\nHowever, others see the play as preceding 20th century feminist condemnation of patriarchal domination, and as an argument for the liberation of women. For example, Conall Morrison, director of the RSC's 2008 production, wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I find it gobsmacking that some people see the play as misogynistic. I believe that it is a moral tale. I believe that it is saying \u2013 \"do not be like this\" and \"do not do this.\" \"These people are objectionable.\" By the time you get to the last scene all of the men \u2013 including her father are saying \u2013 it's amazing how you crushed that person. It's amazing how you lobotomised her. And they're betting on the women as though they are dogs in a race or horses. It's reduced to that. And it's all about money and the level of power. Have you managed to crush Katharina or for Hortensio and Lucentio, will you be able to control Bianca and the widow? Will you similarly be able to control your proto-shrews? It is so self-evidently repellent that I don't believe for a second that Shakespeare is espousing this. And I don't believe for a second that the man who would be interested in Benedict and Cleopatra and Romeo and Juliet and all these strong lovers would have some misogynist aberration. It's very obviously a satire on this male behaviour and a cautionary tale [...] That's not how he views women and relationships, as demonstrated by the rest of the plays. This is him investigating misogyny, exploring it and animating it and obviously damning it because none of the men come out smelling of roses. When the chips are down they all default to power positions and self-protection and status and the one woman who was a challenge to them, with all with her wit and intellect, they are all gleeful and relieved to see crushed.\nPhilippa Kelly makes this point:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Petruchio's \"taming\" of Kate, harsh though it may be, is a far cry from the fiercely repressive measures going on outside the theatre, and presumably endorsed by much of its audience. Some critics argue that in mitigating the violence both of folktales and of actual practices, Shakespeare sets up Petruchio as a ruffian and a bully, but only as a \"disguise\" \u2013 and a disguise that implicitly criticises the brutal arrogance of conventional male attitudes.\nJonathan Miller, director of the 1980 \"BBC Television Shakespeare\" adaptation, and several theatrical productions, argues that although the play is not misogynistic, neither is it a feminist treatise:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I think it's an irresponsible and silly thing to make that play into a feminist tract: to use it as a way of proving that women have been dishonoured and hammered flat by male chauvinism. There's another, more complex way of reading it than that: which sees it as being their particular view of how society ought to be organised in order to restore order in a fallen world. Now, we don't happen to think that we are inheritors of the sin of Adam and that orderliness can only be preserved by deputing power to magistrates and sovereigns, fathers and husbands. But the fact that they did think like that is absolutely undeniable, so productions which really do try to deny that, and try to hijack the work to make it address current problems about women's place in society, become boring, thin and tractarian.\nInduction.\nAn element in the debate regarding the play's misogyny, or lack thereof, is the Induction, and how it relates to the Katherina/Petruchio story. According to H.J. Oliver, \"it has become orthodoxy to claim to find in the Induction the same 'theme' as is to be found in both the Bianca and the Katherine-Petruchio plots of the main play, and to take it for granted that identity of theme is a merit and 'justifies' the introduction of Sly.\" For example, Geoffrey Bullough argues the three plots \"are all linked in idea because all contain discussion of the relations of the sexes in marriage.\" Richard Hosley suggests the three plots form a unified whole insofar as they all deal with \"assumptions about identity and assumptions about personality.\" Oliver, however, argues that \"the Sly Induction does not so much announce the theme of the enclosed stories as establish their \"tone\".\"\nThis is important in terms of determining the seriousness of Katherina's final speech. Marjorie Garber writes of the Induction, \"the frame performs the important task of distancing the later action, and of insuring a lightness of tone \u2013 significant in light of the real abuse to which Kate is subjected by Petruchio.\" Oliver argues that Induction is used to remove the audience from the world of the enclosed plot \u2013 to place the Sly story on the same level of reality as the audience, and the Katherina/Petruchio story on a different level of reality. This, he argues, is done to ensure the audience does not take the play literally, that it sees the Katherina/Petruchio story as a farce:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the phenomenon of theatrical illusion is itself being laughed at; and the play within the play makes Sly drowsy and probably soon sends him to sleep. Are we to let \"that\" play preach morality to us or look in it for social or intellectual substance? The drunken tinker may be believed in as one believes in any realistically presented character; but we cannot 'believe' in something that is not even mildly interesting to him. The play within the play has been presented only after all the preliminaries have encouraged us to take it as a farce.\nOliver argues that \"the main purpose of the Induction was to set the tone for the play within the play \u2013 in particular, to present the story of Kate and her sister as none-too-serious comedy put on to divert a drunken tinker\". He suggests that if the Induction is removed from a production of the play (as it very often is), a fundamental part of the structure has been lost. Speaking of Jonathan Miller's \"BBC Television Shakespeare\" adaptation of 1980, which omitted the Induction, Stanley Wells wrote \"to omit the Christopher Sly episodes is to suppress one of Shakespeare's most volatile lesser characters, to jettison most of the play's best poetry, and to strip it of an entire dramatic dimension.\"\nRegarding the importance of the Induction, Jonathan Bate and Eric Rasmussen argue that \"the Sly framework establishes a self-referential theatricality in which the status of the shrew-play \"as\" a play is enforced.\" Graham Holderness argues \"the play in its received entirety does not propose any simple or unitary view of sexual politics: it contains a crudely reactionary dogma of masculine supremacy, but it also works on that ideology to force its expression into self-contradiction. The means by which this self-interrogation is accomplished is that complex theatrical device of the Sly-framework [...] without the metadramatic potentialities of the Sly-framework, any production of \"Shrew\" is thrown much more passively at the mercy of the director's artistic and political ideology.\" Copp\u00e9lia Kahn suggests \"the transformation of Christopher Sly from drunken lout to noble lord, a transformation only temporary and skin-deep, suggests that Kate's switch from independence may also be deceptive and prepares us for the irony of the \"d\u00e9nouement\".\" The Induction serves to undercut charges of misogyny \u2013 the play within the play is a farce, it is not supposed to be taken seriously by the audience, as it is not taken seriously by Sly. As such, questions of the seriousness of what happens within it are rendered irrelevant.\nLanguage.\nLanguage itself is a major theme in the play, especially in the taming process, where mastery of language becomes paramount. Katherina is initially described as a shrew because of her harsh language to those around her. Karen Newman points out, \"from the outset of the play, Katherine's threat to male authority is posed through language: it is perceived by others as such and is linked to a claim larger than shrewishness\u2013witchcraft\u2013through the constant allusions to Katherine's kinship with the devil.\" For example, after Katherina rebukes Hortensio and Gremio in Act 1, Scene 1, Hortensio replies with \"From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!\" (l.66). Even Katherina's own father refers to her as \"thou hilding of a devilish spirit\" (2.1.26). Petruchio, however, attempts to tame her \u2013 and thus her language \u2013 with rhetoric that specifically undermines her tempestuous nature;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nSay that she rail, why then I'll tell her plain\nShe sings as sweetly as a nightingale.\nSay that she frown, I'll say that she looks as clear\nAs morning roses newly washed with dew.\nSay she be mute and will not speak a word,\nThen I'll commend her volubility\nAnd say she uttereth piercing eloquence.\nIf she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,\nAs though she bid me stay by her a week.\nIf she deny to wed, I'll crave the day\nWhen I shall ask the banns, and when be marri\u00e8d.\n(2.1.169\u2013179)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nHere Petruchio is specifically attacking the very function of Katherina's language, vowing that no matter what she says, he will purposely misinterpret it, thus undermining the basis of the linguistic sign, and disrupting the relationship between signifier and signified. In this sense, Margaret Jane Kidnie argues this scene demonstrates the \"slipperiness of language.\"\nApart from undermining her language, Petruchio also uses language to objectify her. For example, in Act 3, Scene 2, Petruchio explains to all present that Katherina is now literally his property:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nShe is my goods, my chattels, she is my house,\nMy household stuff, my field, my barn,\nMy horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing.\n(ll.232\u2013234)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn discussing Petruchio's objectification of Katherina, Tita French Baumlin focuses on his puns on her name. By referring to her as a \"cake\" and a \"cat\" (2.1.185\u2013195), he objectifies her in a more subtle manner than saying she belongs to him. A further aspect of Petruchio's taming rhetoric is the repeated comparison of Katherina to animals. In particular, he is prone to comparing her to a hawk (2.1.8 and 4.1.177\u2013183), often employing an overarching hunting metaphor; \"My falcon now is sharp and passing empty,/And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged\" (4.1.177\u2013178). Katherina, however, appropriates this method herself, leading to a trading of insults rife with animal imagery in Act 2, Scene 1 (ll.207\u2013232), where she compares Petruchio to a turtle and a crab.\nLanguage itself has thus become a battleground. However, it is Petruchio who seemingly emerges as the victor. In his house, after Petruchio has dismissed the haberdasher, Katherina exclaims\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\nWhy sir, I trust I may have leave to speak,\nAnd speak I will. I am no child, no babe;\nYour betters have endured me say my mind,\nAnd if you cannot, best you stop your ears.\nMy tongue will tell the anger of my heart,\nOr else my heart concealing it will break,\nAnd rather than it shall, I will be free\nEven to the uttermost, as I please, in words.\n(4.3.74\u201380)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nKatherina is here declaring her independence of language; no matter what Petruchio may do, she will always be free to speak her mind. However, only one hundred lines later, the following exchange occurs;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"PETRUCHIO\"\nLet's see, I think 'tis now some seven o'clock.\nAnd well we may come there by dinner-time.\n\"KATHERINA\"\nI dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two,\nAnd 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.\n\"PETRUCHIO\"\nIt shall be seven ere I go to horse.\nLook what I speak, or do, or think to do,\nYou are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone,\nI will not go today; and ere I do,\nIt shall be what o'clock I say it is.\n(4.3.184\u2013192)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nKidnie says of this scene, \"the language game has suddenly changed and the stakes have been raised. Whereas before he seemed to mishear or misunderstand her words, Petruchio now overtly tests his wife's subjection by demanding that she concede to his views even when they are demonstrably unreasonable. The lesson is that Petruchio has the absolute authority to rename their world.\" Katherina is free to say whatever she wishes, as long she agrees with Petruchio. His apparent victory in the 'language game' is seen in Act 4, Scene 5, when Katherina is made to switch the words \"moon\" and \"sun\", and she concedes that she will agree with whatever Petruchio says, no matter how absurd:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAnd be it the moon, or sun, or what you please;\nAnd if you please to call it a rush-candle,\nHenceforth I vow it shall be so for me\nBut sun it is not, when you say it is not,\nAnd the moon changes even as your mind:\nWhat you will have it named, even that it is,\nAnd so it shall be so for Katherine.\n(ll.12\u201315; ll.19\u201322)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nOf this scene, Kidnie argues \"what he 'says' must take priority over what Katherina 'knows'.\" From this point, Katherina's language changes from her earlier vernacular; instead of defying Petruchio and his words, she has apparently succumbed to his rhetoric and accepted that she will use \"his\" language instead of her own \u2013 both Katherina and her language have, seemingly, been tamed.\nThe important role of language, however, is not confined to the taming plot. For example, in a psychoanalytic reading of the play, Joel Fineman suggests there is a distinction made between male and female language, further subcategorising the latter into good and bad, epitomised by Bianca and Katherina respectively. Language is also important in relation to the Induction. Here, Sly speaks in prose until he begins to accept his new role as lord, at which point he switches to blank verse and adopts the royal we. Language is also important in relation to Tranio and Lucentio, who appear on stage speaking a highly artificial style of blank verse full of classical and mythological allusions and elaborate metaphors and similes, thus immediately setting them aside from the more straightforward language of the Induction, and alerting the audience to the fact that they are now in an entirely different \"milieu\".\nThemes.\nFemale submissiveness.\nIn productions of the play, it is often the interpretation of Katherina's final speech (the longest speech in the play) that defines the tone of the entire production, such is the importance of this speech and what it says, or seems to say, about female submission:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTraditionally, many critics have taken the speech literally. Writing in 1943, for example, G.I. Duthie argued \"what Shakespeare emphasises here is the foolishness of trying to destroy order.\" However, in a modern western society, holding relatively egalitarian views on gender, such an interpretation presents a dilemma, as according to said interpretation the play seemingly celebrates female subjugation.\nCritically, four main theories have emerged in response to Katherina's speech;\nGeorge Bernard Shaw wrote in 1897 that \"no man with any decency of feeling can sit it out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamed of the lord-of-creation moral implied in the wager and the speech put into the woman's own mouth.\" Katherina is seen as having been successfully tamed, and having come to accept her newly submissive role to such an extent that she advocates that role for others, the final speech rationalises, according to Duthie, in both a political and sociological sense, the submission of wives to husbands.\nActress Meryl Streep, who played Katherina in 1978 at the Shakespeare in the Park festival, says of the play, \"really what matters is that they have an incredible passion and love; it's not something that Katherina admits to right away, but it does provide the source of her change.\" Similarly, John C. Bean sees the speech as the final stage in the process of Katherina's change of heart towards Petruchio; \"if we can appreciate the liberal element in Kate's last speech \u2013 the speech that strikes modern sensibilities as advocating male tyranny \u2013 we can perhaps see that Kate is tamed not in the automatic manner of behavioural psychology but in the spontaneous manner of the later romantic comedies where characters lose themselves and emerge, as if from a dream, liberated into the bonds of love.\"\nPerhaps the most common interpretation in the modern era is that the speech is ironic; Katherina has not been tamed at all, she has merely duped Petruchio into thinking she has. Two especially well-known examples of this interpretation are seen in the two major feature film adaptations of the play; Sam Taylor's 1929 version and Franco Zeffirelli's 1967 version. In Taylor's film, Katherina, played by Mary Pickford, winks at Bianca during the speech, indicating she does not mean a word of what she is saying. In Zeffirelli's film, Katherina, played by Elizabeth Taylor, delivers the speech as though it were her own idea, and the submission aspect is reversed by her ending the speech and leaving the room, causing Petruchio to have to run after her. Phyllis Rackin is an example of a scholar who reads the speech ironically, especially in how it deals with gender. She points out that several lines in the speech focus on the woman's body, but in the Elizabethan theatre, the role would have been played by a young boy, thus rendering any evocation of the female form as ironic. Reading the play as a satire of gender roles, she sees the speech as the culmination of this process. Along similar lines, Philippa Kelly says \"the body of the boy actor in Shakespeare's time would have created a sexual indeterminacy that would have undermined the patriarchal narrative, so that the taming is only \"apparently\" so. And in declaring women's passivity so extensively and performing it centre-stage, Kate might be seen to take on a kind of agency that rebukes the feminine codes of silence and obedience which she so expressly advocates.\" Similarly, Copp\u00e9lia Kahn argues the speech is really about how little Katherina has been tamed; \"she steals the scene from her husband, who has held the stage throughout the play, and reveals that he has failed to tame her in the sense he set out to. He has gained her outward compliance in the form of a public display, while her spirit remains mischievously free.\"\nIn relation to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed by an adult male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls on her as she is riding to Petruchio's home, and she is able to lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.\nThe fourth school of thought is that the play is a farce, and hence the speech should not be read seriously or ironically. For example, Robert B. Heilman argues that \"the whole wager scene falls essentially within the realm of farce: the responses are largely mechanical, as is their symmetry. Kate's final long speech on the obligations and fitting style of wives we can think of as a more or less automatic statement \u2013 that is, the kind appropriate to farce \u2013 of a generally held doctrine.\" He further makes his case by positing:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;there are two arguments against [an ironic interpretation]. One is that a careful reading of the lines will show that most of them have to be taken literally; only the last seven or eight lines can be read with ironic overtones [...] The second is that some forty lines of straight irony would be too much to be borne; it would be inconsistent with the straightforwardness of most of the play, and it would really turn Kate back into a hidden shrew whose new technique was sarcastic indirection, side mouthing at the audience, while her not very intelligent husband, bamboozled, cheered her on.\nAnother way in which to read the speech (and the play) as farcical is to focus on the Induction. H.J. Oliver, for example, emphasising the importance of the Induction, writes \"the play within the play has been presented only after all the preliminaries have encouraged us to take it as a farce. We have been warned.\" Of Katherina's speech, he argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;this lecture by Kate on the wife's duty to submit is the only fitting climax \"to the farce\" \u2013 and for that very reason, it cannot logically be taken seriously, orthodox though the views expressed may be [...] attempting to take the last scene as a continuation of the realistic portrayal of character leads some modern producers to have it played as a kind of private joke between Petruchio and Kate \u2013 or even have Petruchio imply that by now he is thoroughly ashamed of himself. It does not, cannot, work. The play has changed key: it has modulated back from something like realistic social comedy to the other, 'broader' kind of entertainment that was foretold by the Induction.\nEmma Smith suggests a possible fifth interpretation: Petruchio and Kate have colluded together to plot this set-piece speech, \"a speech learned off pat\", to demonstrate that Kate is the most obedient of the three wives and so allow Petruchio to win the wager.\nGender politics.\nThe issue of gender politics is an important theme in \"The Taming of the Shrew\". In a letter to the \"Pall Mall Gazette\", George Bernard Shaw famously called the play \"one vile insult to womanhood and manhood from the first word to the last.\" A critic, Emily Detmer, points out that in the late 16th and early 17th century, laws curtailing husbands' use of violence in disciplining their wives were becoming more commonplace; \"the same culture that still \"felt good\" about dunking scolds, whipping whores, or burning witches was becoming increasingly sensitive about husbands beating their wives.\" Detmer argues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the vigor of public discourse on wife-beating exemplifies a culture at work reformulating permissible and impermissible means for husbands to maintain control over the politics of the family, without, however, questioning that goal. This new boundary was built on notions of class and civil behaviour. Shakespeare's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" acts as a comedic roadmap for reconfiguring these emergent modes of \"skillful\" and civilised dominance for \"gentle\"men, that is, for subordinating a wife without resorting to the \"common\" man's brute strength.\nPetruchio's answer is to psychologically tame Katherina, a method not frowned upon by society; \"the play signals a shift towards a \"modern\" way of managing the subordination of wives by legitimatising domination as long as it is not physical.\" Detmer argues \"Shakespeare's \"shrew\" is tamed in a manner that would have made the wife-beating reformers proud; Petruchio's taming \"policy\" dramatises how abstention from physical violence works better. The play encourages its audience not only to pay close attention to Petruchio's method but also to judge and enjoy the method's permissibility because of the absence of blows and the harmonious outcome.\"\nHowever, Detmer is critical of scholars who defend Shakespeare for depicting male dominance in a less brutal fashion than many of his contemporaries. For example, although not specifically mentioned by Detmer, Michael West writes \"the play's attitude was characteristically Elizabethan and was expressed more humanly by Shakespeare than by some of his sources.\" Detmer goes on to read the play in light of modern psychological theories regarding women's responses to domestic violence, and argues that Katherina develops Stockholm syndrome:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;a model of domestic violence that includes tactics other than physical violence gives readers a way in which to understand Kate's romanticised surrender at the end of the play as something other than consensual, as, in fact, a typical response to abuse [...] Like a victim of the Stockholm syndrome, she denies her own feelings in order to bond with her abuser. Her surrender and obedience signify her emotional bondage as a survival strategy; she aims to please because her life depends upon it. Knowing how the Stockholm syndrome works can help us to see that whatever \"subjectivity\" might be achieved is created out of domination and coercive bonding.\nIn a Marxist reading of the play, Natasha Korda argues that, although Petruchio is not characterised as a violent man, he still embodies sixteenth-century notions regarding the subjugation and objectification of women. Shrew-taming stories existed prior to Shakespeare's play, and in such stories, \"the object of the tale was simply to put the shrew to work, to restore her (frequently through some gruesome form of punishment) to her proper productive place within the household economy.\" Petruchio does not do this, but Korda argues he still works to curtail the activities of the woman; \"Kate [is] not a reluctant producer, but rather an avid and sophisticated consumer of market goods [...] Petruchio's taming strategy is accordingly aimed not at his wife's productive capacity \u2013 not once does he ask Kate to brew, bake, wash, card, or spin \u2013 but at her consumption. He seeks to educate her in her role as a consumer.\" She believes that even though Petruchio does not use force to tame Katherina, his actions are still an endorsement of patriarchy; he makes her his property and tames her into accepting a patriarchal economic worldview. Vital in this reading is Katherina's final speech, which Korda argues \"inaugurates a new gendered division of labour, according to which husbands \"labour both by sea and land\" while their wives luxuriate at home [...] In erasing the status of housework as work, separate-sphere ideology renders the housewife perpetually indebted to her husband [...] \"The Taming of the Shrew\" marks the emergence of the ideological separation of feminine and masculine spheres of labour.\"\nIn a theology-based reading of how gender politics are handled in the play, David Beauregard reads the relationship between Katherina and Petruchio in traditional Aristotelian terms. Petruchio, as the architect of virtue (\"Politics\", 1.13), brings Kate into harmony with her nature by developing her \"new-built virtue and obedience\", (5.2.118), and she, in turn, brings to Petruchio in her person all the Aristotelian components of happiness \u2013 wealth and good fortune, virtue, friendship and love, the promise of domestic peace and quiet (\"Nicomachean Ethics\", 1.7\u20138). The virtue of obedience at the center of Kate's final speech is not what Aristotle describes as the despotic rule of master over slave, but rather the statesman's rule over a free and equal person (\"Politics\", 1.3, 12\u201313). Recognising the evil of despotic domination, the play holds up in inverse form Kate's shrewishness, the feminine form of the will to dominance, as an evil that obstructs natural fulfillment and destroys marital happiness.\nCruelty.\nAnother theme in the play is cruelty. Alexander Leggatt states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;the taming of Katherina is not just a lesson, but a game \u2013 a test of skill and a source of pleasure. The roughness is, at bottom, part of the fun: such is the peculiar psychology of sport that one is willing to endure aching muscles and risk the occasional broken limb for the sake of the challenge. The sports most often recalled throughout the play are blood sports, hunting and hawking, thus invoking in the audience the state of mind in which cruelty and violence are acceptable, even exciting, because their scope is limited by tacit agreement and they are made the occasion for a display of skill.\nAnn Thompson argues that \"the fact that in the folktale versions the shrew-taming story always comes to its climax when the husbands wager on their wives' obedience must have been partly responsible for the large number of references to sporting, gaming and gambling throughout the play. These metaphors can help to make Petruchio's cruelty acceptable by making it seem limited and conventionalised.\" Marvin Bennet Krims argues that \"the play leans heavily on representations of cruelty for its comedic effect.\" He believes cruelty permeates the entire play, including the Induction, arguing the Sly frame, with the Lord's spiteful practical joke, prepares the audience for a play willing to treat cruelty as a comedic matter. He suggests that cruelty is a more important theme than gender, arguing that \"the aggression represented in \"Taming\" can be read as having less to do with gender and more to do with hate, with the text thereby becoming a comic representation of the general problem of human cruelty and victimisation.\"\nDirector Michael Bogdanov, who directed the play in 1978, considers that \"Shakespeare was a feminist\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Shakespeare shows women totally abused \u2013 like animals \u2013 bartered to the highest bidder. He shows women used as commodities, not allowed to choose for themselves. In \"The Taming of the Shrew\" you get that extraordinary scene between Baptista, Grumio, and Tranio, where they are vying with each other to see who can offer most for Bianca, who is described as 'the prize'. It is a toss of the coin to see which way she will go: to the old man with a certain amount of money, or to the young man, who is boasting that he's got so many ships. She could end up with the old impotent fool, or the young 'eligible' man: what sort of life is that to look forward to? There is no question of it, [Shakespeare's] sympathy is with the women, and his purpose, to expose the cruelty of a society that allows these things to happen.\nMoney.\nThe motivation of money is another theme. When speaking of whether or not someone may ever want to marry Katherina, Hortensio says \"Though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums, why man, there be good fellows in the world, and a man could light on them, would take her with all faults and money enough\" (1.1.125\u2013128). In the scene that follows Petruchio says:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;poem&gt;\nIf thou know\nOne rich enough to be Petruchio's wife-\nAs wealth is burden of my wooing dance-\nBe she as foul as was Florentius' love,\nAs old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd\nAs Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,\nShe moves me not.\n(1.2.65\u201371)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nA few lines later Grumio says, \"Why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne're a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal\" (1.2.77\u201380). Furthermore, Petruchio is encouraged to woo Katherina by Gremio, Tranio (as Lucentio), and Hortensio, who vow to pay him if he wins her, on top of Baptista's dowry (\"After my death, the one half of my lands, and in possession, twenty thousand crowns\"). Later, Petruchio does not agree with Baptista on the subject of love in this exchange:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;poem&gt;\n\"BAPTISTA\"\nWhen the special thing is well obtained,\nThat is, her love; for that is all in all.\n\"PETRUCHIO\"\nWhy that is nothing.\n(2.1.27\u201329)\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nGremio and Tranio literally bid for Bianca. As Baptista says, \"'Tis deeds must win the prize, and he of both/That can assure my daughter greatest dower/Shall have my Bianca's love\" (2.1.344\u2013346).\nAdaptations.\nOpera.\nThe first opera based on the play was Ferdinando Bertoni's opera buffa \"Il duca di Atene\" (1780), with libretto by Carlo Francesco Badini.\nFrederic Reynolds' \"Catherine and Petruchio\" (1828) is an adaptation of Garrick, with an overture taken from Gioachino Rossini, songs derived from numerous Shakespeare plays and sonnets, and music by John Braham and Thomas Simpson Cooke. Starring Fanny Ayton and James William Wallack, the opera premiered at Drury Lane, but it was not successful, and closed after only a few performances. Hermann Goetz' \"Der Widersp\u00e4nstigen Z\u00e4hmung\" (1874), with libretto by Joseph Viktor Widmann, is a comic opera, which focuses on the Bianca subplot, and cuts back the taming story. It was first performed at the original National Theatre Mannheim. John Kendrick Bangs' \"Katherine: A Travesty\" (1888) is a Gilbert and Sullivan-style parody operetta which premiered in the Metropolitan Opera. Spyridon Samaras' \"La furia domata: commedia musicale in tre atti\" (1895) is a now lost lyric comedy with libretto by Enrico Annibale Butti and Giulio Macchi, which premiered at the Teatro Lirico. Ruperto Chap\u00ed's \"Las brav\u00edas\" (1896), with a libretto by Jos\u00e9 L\u00f3pez Silva and Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez Shaw, is a one-act \"g\u00e9nero chico\" \"zarzuela\" clearly based on the story, but with names changed and the location altered to Madrid: it was a major success in Spain, with over 200 performances in 1896 alone, and continues to be performed regularly.\nJohan Wagenaar's \"De getemde feeks\" (1909) is the second of three overtures Wagenaar wrote based on Shakespeare, the others being \"Koning Jan\" (1891) and \"Driekoningenavond\" (1928). Another overture inspired by the play is Alfred Reynolds' \"The Taming of the Shrew Overture\" (1927). Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari's verismo opera \"Sly, ovvero la leggenda del dormiente risvegliato\" (1927) focuses on the Induction, with libretto by Giovacchino Forzano. A tragedy, the opera depicts Sly as a hard-drinking and debt-ridden poet who sings in a London pub. When he is tricked into believing that he is a lord, his life improves, but upon learning it is a ruse, he mistakenly concludes the woman he loves (Dolly) only told him she loved him as part of the ruse. In despair, he kills himself by cutting his wrists, with Dolly arriving too late to save him. Starring Aureliano Pertile and Mercedes Llopart, it was first performed at La Scala in Milan. Rudolf Karel's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" is an unfinished opera upon which he worked between 1942 and 1944. Philip Greeley Clapp's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1948) was first performed at the Metropolitan Opera. Vittorio Giannini's \"The Taming of the Shrew\" (1953) is an opera buffa, with libretto by Giannini and Dorothy Fee. It was first performed at the Cincinnati Music Hall, starring Dorothy Short and Robert Kircher. Vissarion Shebalin's \"Ukroshchenye stroptivoy\" (1957), with libretto by Abram Akimovich Gozenpud, was Shebalin's last opera and was immediately hailed as a masterpiece throughout Russia. Dominick Argento's \"Christopher Sly\" (1962), with libretto by John Manlove, is a comic opera in two scenes and an interlude, first performed in the University of Minnesota. Sly is duped by a Lord into believing that he himself is a lord. However, he soon becomes aware of the ruse, and when left alone, he flees with the Lord's valuables and his two mistresses.\nMusical/ballet.\nThe earliest known musical adaptation of the play was a ballad opera based on Charles Johnson's \"The Cobler of Preston\". Called \"The Cobler of Preston's Opera\", the piece was anonymously written, although William Dunkin is thought by some scholars as a likely candidate. Rehearsals for the premiere began in Smock Alley in October 1731, but sometime in November or December, the show was cancelled. It was instead performed by a group of children (including an eleven-year-old Peg Woffington) in January 1732 at Signora Violante's New Booth in Dame Street. It was subsequently published in March.\nJames Worsdale's \"A Cure for a Scold\" is also a ballad opera. First performed at Drury Lane in 1735, starring Kitty Clive and Charles Macklin, \"A Cure for a Scold\" was an adaptation of Lacy's \"Sauny the Scot\" rather than Shakespeare's original \"Taming of the Shrew\". Petruchio was renamed Manly, and Katherina was renamed Margaret (nicknamed Peg). At the end, there is no wager. Instead, Peg pretends she is dying, and as Petruchio runs for a doctor, she reveals she is fine, and declares \"you have taught me what 'tis to be a Wife, and I shall make it my Study to be obliging and obedient,\" to which Manly replies \"My best Peg, we will exchange Kindness, and be each others Servants.\" After the play has finished, the actress playing Peg steps forward and speaks directly to the audience as herself; \"Well, I must own, it wounds me to the Heart/To play, unwomanly, so mean a Part./What \u2013 to submit, so tamely \u2013 so contented,/Thank Heav'n! I'm not the Thing I represented.\"\nCole Porter's musical \"Kiss Me, Kate\" is an adaptation of \"Taming of the Shrew\". The music and lyrics are by Porter and the book is by Samuel and Bella Spewack. It is at least partially based on the 1935/1936 Theatre Guild production of \"Taming of the Shrew\", which starred husband and wife Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, whose backstage fights became legendary. The musical tells the story of a husband and wife acting duo (Fred and Lilli) attempting to stage \"The Taming of the Shrew\", but whose backstage fights keep getting in the way. The musical opened on Broadway at the New Century Theatre in 1948, running for a total of 1,077 performances. Directed by John C. Wilson with choreography by Hanya Holm, it starred Patricia Morison and Alfred Drake. The production moved to the West End in 1951, directed by Samuel Spewack with choreography again by Holm, and starring Patricia Morison and Bill Johnson. It ran for 501 performances. As well as being a box office hit, the musical was also a critical success, winning five Tony Awards; Best Authors (Musical), Best Original Score, Best Costume Design, Best Musical and Best Producers (Musical). The play has since been revived numerous times in various countries. Its 1999 revival at the Martin Beck Theatre, directed by Michael Blakemore and starring Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell, was especially successful, winning another five Tonys; Best Actor (Musical), Best Costume Design, Best Director (Musical), Best Orchestrations, and Best Revival (Musical).\nThe first ballet version of the play was Maurice B\u00e9jart's \"La m\u00e9g\u00e8re apprivois\u00e9e\". Using the music of Alessandro Scarlatti, it was originally performed by the Ballet de l'Op\u00e9ra de Paris in 1954. The best known ballet adaptation is John Cranko's \"The Taming of the Shrew\", first performed by the Stuttgart Ballet at the Staatsoper Stuttgart in 1969. Another ballet adaptation is Louis Falco's \"Kate's Rag\", first performed by the Louis Falco Dance Company at the Akademie der K\u00fcnste in 1980. In 1988, Aleksandre Machavariani composed a ballet suite, but it was not performed until 2009, when his son, conductor Vakhtang Machavariani, gave a concert at the Georgian National Music Center featuring music by Modest Mussorgsky, Sergei Prokofiev and some of his father's pieces.\nRadio.\nIn 1924, extracts from the play were broadcast on BBC Radio, performed by the Cardiff Station Repertory Company as the eight episode of a series of programs showcasing Shakespeare's plays, entitled \"Shakespeare Night\". Extracts were also broadcast in 1925 as part of \"Shakespeare: Scene and Story\", with Edna Godfrey-Turner and William Macready, and in 1926 as part of \"Shakespeare's Heroines\", with Madge Titheradge and Edmund Willard. In 1927, a forty-three-minute truncation of the play was broadcast on BBC National Programme, with Barbara Couper and Ian Fleming. In 1932, National Programme aired another truncated version, this one running eighty-five minutes, and again starring Couper, with Francis James as Petruchio. In 1935, Peter Creswell directed a broadcast of the relatively complete text (only the Bianca subplot was trimmed) on National Programme, starring Mary Hinton and Godfrey Tearle. This was the first non-theatrical version of the play to feature Sly, who was played by Stuart Robertson. In 1941, Creswell directed another adaptation for BBC Home Service, again starring Tearle, with Fay Compton as Katherina. In 1947, BBC Light Programme aired extracts for their \"Theatre Programme\" from John Burrell's Edinburgh Festival production, with Patricia Burke and Trevor Howard. In 1954, the full-length play aired on BBC Home Service, directed by Peter Watts, starring Mary Wimbush and Joseph O'Conor, with Norman Shelley as Sly. BBC Radio 4 aired another full-length broadcast (without the Induction) in 1973 as part of their \"Monday Night Theatre\" series, directed by Ian Cotterell, starring Fenella Fielding and Paul Daneman. In 1989, BBC Radio 3 aired the full play, directed by Jeremy Mortimer, starring Cheryl Campbell and Bob Peck, with William Simons as Sly. In 2000, BBC Radio 3 aired another full-length production (without the Induction) as part of their \"Shakespeare for the New Millennium\" series, directed by Melanie Harris, and starring Ruth Mitchell and Gerard McSorley.\nIn the United States, the first major radio production was in July 1937 on NBC Blue Network, when John Barrymore adapted the play into a forty-five-minute piece, starring Elaine Barrie and Barrymore himself. In August of the same year, CBS Radio aired a sixty-minute adaptation directed by Brewster Mason, starring Frieda Inescort and Edward G. Robinson. The adaptation was written by Gilbert Seldes, who employed a narrator (Godfrey Tearle) to fill in gaps in the story, tell the audience about the clothes worn by the characters and offer opinions as to the direction of the plot. For example, Act 4, Scene 5 ends with the narrator musing \"We know that Katherina obeys her husband, but has her spirit been really tamed I wonder?\" In 1940, a thirty-minute musical version of the play written by Joseph Gottlieb and Irvin Graham aired on CBS as part of their \"Columbia Workshop\" series, starring Nan Sunderland and Carleton Young. In 1941, NBC Blue Network aired a sixty-minute adaptation as part of their \"Great Plays\" series, written by Ranald MacDougall, directed by Charles Warburton, and starring Grace Coppin and Herbert Rudley. In 1949, ABC Radio aired an adaptation directed by Homer Fickett, starring Joyce Redman and Burgess Meredith. In 1953, NBC broadcast William Dawkins' production live from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. The cast list for this production has been lost, but it is known to have featured George Peppard. In 1960, NBC aired a sixty-minute version adapted by Carl Ritchie from Robert Loper's stage production for the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, starring Ann Hackney and Gerard Larson.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\nAll references to \"The Taming of the Shrew\", unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Oxford Shakespeare (Oliver, 1982), which is based on the 1623 First Folio.

In width, it ranges from near its center, to at the isthmus on its northern edge, to less near its southern tip of Cape Charles. It is bordered by the Chesapeake Bay on the west, Pocomoke Sound on the southwest, and the Delaware River, Delaware Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean on the east.\nThe population of the twelve counties entirely on the peninsula totals 818,014 people as of the 2020 census.\nEtymology.\nIn older sources, the peninsula between Delaware Bay and Chesapeake Bay was variously known as the Delaware and Chesapeake Peninsula or simply the Chesapeake Peninsula.\nThe toponym \"Delmarva\" is a clipped compound of Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia ( \"VA\"), which in turn was modeled after Delmar, a border town named after Delaware and Maryland. While Delmar was founded and named in 1859, the earliest uses of the name Delmarva occurred several years later (for example on February 10, 1877, in \"The Middletown Transcript\" newspaper in Middletown, Delaware) and appear to have been commercial and booster-driven; for example, the \"Delmarva Heat, Light, and Refrigerating Corp.\" of Chincoteague, Virginia, was in existence by 1913\u2014but general use of the term did not occur until the 1920s.\nGeography.\nAt the northern point of the peninsula the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line separates the crystalline rocks of the Piedmont from the unconsolidated sediments of the Coastal Plain. This line passes through Newark, Delaware, and Wilmington, Delaware, and Elkton, Maryland. The northern isthmus of the peninsula is transected by the sea-level Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. Several bridges cross the canal, and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel join the peninsula to mainland Maryland and Virginia, respectively. Another point of access is Lewes, Delaware, reachable by the Cape May\u2013Lewes Ferry from Cape May, New Jersey.\nDover, Delaware, is the peninsula's largest city by population. The main commercial areas are Dover in the north and Salisbury, Maryland, near its center. Including all offshore islands, the largest of which is Kent Island in Maryland, the total land area south of the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal is . At the 2020 census the total population was 818,000, giving an average population density of .\nCape Charles forms the southern tip of the peninsula in Virginia.\nThe entire Delmarva Peninsula falls within the Atlantic Coastal Plain, a flat and sandy area with very few or no hills; the highest point in the peninsula is only above sea level. The fall line, found in the region southwest of Wilmington, Delaware, and just north of the northern edge of the Delmarva Peninsula, is a geographic borderland where the Piedmont region transitions into the coastal plain. Its Atlantic Ocean coast is formed by the Virginia Barrier Islands in the south and Cape Henlopen in the north, encompassing Ocean City, Maryland, and the Delaware Beaches from Fenwick Island to Lewes.\nThe peninsula has a humid subtropical climate (\"Cfa\") according to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. According to the Trewartha climate classification, the northern half has a temperate or oceanic climate (\"Do\").\nCulture.\nThe culture of Delmarva is much like the rest of the Southern United States. While the northern portion of Delmarva, such as the Wilmington metro area, is similar to the urban regions of Philadelphia, the Maryland, Virginia, and \"Slower Lower\" Delaware counties are more conservative than their \"mainland\" counties. It has been suggested that Delmarva residents have a variation of Southern American English which is particularly prevalent in rural areas.\nDelmarva is driven by agriculture and commercial fishing. Most of the land is rural, with a few large population centers, though tourism has been an important part of the region.\nDelmarva has longstanding Catholic roots, but now Protestants are more numerous, with Methodism being particularly strongly represented. Numerous Catholic churches dating to the 17th century are still operating, such as Old Bohemia Church, which is dedicated to Saint Francis Xavier in Cecil County, Maryland. There are several historically significant Episcopalian churches, such as Old Trinity Church in southern Dorchester County and Christ Church in Cambridge, Maryland.\nPolitical divisions.\nThe border between Maryland and Delaware, which resulted from the 80-year-long Penn\u2013Calvert Boundary Dispute, consists of the east\u2013west Transpeninsular Line and the perpendicular north\u2013south portion of the Mason\u2013Dixon line extending north to just beyond its tangential intersection with the Twelve-Mile Circle which forms Delaware's border with Pennsylvania. The border between Maryland and Virginia on the peninsula follows the Pocomoke River from the Chesapeake to a series of straight surveyed lines connecting the Pocomoke to the Atlantic Ocean.\nAll three counties in Delaware, New Castle (partially), Kent, and Sussex, are located on the peninsula. Of the 23 counties in Maryland, nine are on the Eastern Shore: Kent, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Wicomico, Somerset, and Worcester, as well as a portion of Cecil County. Two Virginia counties are on the peninsula: Accomack and Northampton.\nThe following is a list of some of the notable cities and towns on the peninsula.\nAt its southern tip, the Delmarva Peninsula is connected to Virginia Beach and Hampton Roads, Virginia, via the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel which opened in 1964. The bridge tunnel is owned and administered by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge and Tunnel District.\nLargest municipalities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0State capital and county seat \u2021\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0County seat\u2020\nThe largest Virginia city on the peninsula is Chincoteague, with a 2020 census population of 3,341 residents, which ranks as the 23rd largest municipality on the peninsula.\nProposed state.\nAt various times in history, residents of the Delmarva Peninsula have proposed that its Maryland and Virginia portions secede from their respective states, merging with Kent County and Sussex County, Delaware, to create the state of Delmarva. A Delmarva State Party with this aim was founded in 1992. A combined population with the Eastern Shores of Maryland and Virginia, with the aforementioned two Delaware counties, would be about 750,000, or 921,739 in 2020, roughly the population of South Dakota. Including New Castle County, Delaware, the combined population would be 1,492,458 in 2020, roughly the population of Hawaii or New Hampshire.\nLegislative attempts to break away the Eastern Shore counties of Maryland and join them with Delaware were made several times. In November 1776, delegates from the Eastern Shore attempted to insert a clause into the Maryland Declaration of Rights that would allow the shore counties to secede from Maryland, with the clause being defeated 30\u201317. In 1833, the secession movement came close to succeeding: a Delaware resolution proposing the Eastern Shore of Maryland be absorbed into Delaware passed the Delaware Senate and Delaware House of Representatives, then passed the Maryland House of Delegates with a 40\u201324 vote, but failed to be voted out of committee by the Maryland Senate. The following year, a Caroline County representative proposed allowing the Eastern Shore to secede via referendum, but the Maryland House of Delegates voted 60\u20135 to indefinitely postpone the measure, and that proposal was never taken up again. In 1851, Dorchester County delegate and future Maryland Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks proposed an amendment that would give the Eastern Shore the right to vote itself into Delaware, but the amendment failed 51\u201327.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Presidential election results\nHistory.\nPre-colonization.\nSome studies have shown that Native Americans inhabited the peninsula from about 10,000 BC to 8000 BC \u2013 since the last ice age.\nRecent research indicates that Paleo-Indians inhabited Maryland during the pre-Clovis period (before 13,000 BP). Miles Point, Oyster Cove, and Cator's Cove archaeological sites on the coastal plain of the Delmarva Peninsula help to document a pre-Clovis presence in the Middle Atlantic region. Thus, these sites suggest a human presence in the Middle Atlantic region during the Last Glacial Maximum.\nIn 1970 a stone tool (a biface) said to resemble Solutrean stone tools was dredged up by the trawler \"Cinmar\" off the east coast of Virginia in an area that would have been dry land prior to the rising sea levels of the Pleistocene Epoch. The tool was allegedly found in the same dredge load that contained a mastodon's remains. The mastodon tusks were later determined to be 22,000 years old. However, studies conducted on nearby Parsons Island demonstrate that the stratigraphy of the region is disturbed. In addition several archaeological sites on the Delmarva peninsula with suggestive (but not definitive) dating between 16,000 and 18,000 years have been discovered by Darrin Lowery of the University of Delaware. These factors led Stanford and Bradley to reiterate in 2014 their academic advocacy of pre-Clovis peoples in North America and their possible link to Paleolithic Europeans.\nLifestyles.\nNative settlements relocated as natural conditions dictated. They set up villages \u2013 scattered groups of thatch houses and cultivated gardens \u2013 where conditions favored farming. In the spring they planted crops, which the women and children tended while the men hunted and fished. In the fall they harvested crops, storing food in baskets or underground pits. During the harsh winter, whole communities would move to hunting areas, seeking the deer, rabbit and other game that kept them alive until the spring fishing season. When the farmland around their villages became less productive \u2013 the inhabitants did not practice crop rotation \u2013 the native people would abandon the site and move to another location.\nPopulations.\nThe primary Indigenous peoples of the ocean side of the lower peninsula prior to the arrival of Europeans were the Assateague, including the Assateague, Transquakin, Choptico, Moteawaughkin, Quequashkecaquick, Hatsawap, Wachetak, Marauqhquaick, and Manaskson. Their territories and populations ranged from Cape Charles, Virginia, to the Indian River inlet in Delaware.\nThe upper peninsula and the Chesapeake shore was the home of Nanticoke-speaking people such as the Nentigo and Choptank. The Assateague and Nentigo made a number of treaties with the colony of Maryland, but the land was gradually taken and those treaties dissolved for the use of the colonists, and the native peoples of the peninsula assimilated into other Algonquian tribes as far north as Ontario.\nCurrently, the peninsula is within the traditional territory of the Piscataway, Nentego, and Lenape peoples.\nColonization.\nIn 1566, an expedition sent from Spanish Florida by Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de Avil\u00e9s reached the Delmarva Peninsula. The expedition consisted of two Dominican friars, thirty soldiers and an indigenous Virginia boy, Don Luis, in an effort to set up a Spanish colony in the Chesapeake. At the time, the Spanish believed the Chesapeake to be an opening to the fabled Northwest Passage. However, a storm thwarted their attempts at establishing a colony. The land that is currently Delaware was first colonized by the Dutch West India Company in 1631 as Zwaanendael. That colony lasted one year before a dispute with local Indians led to its destruction. In 1638, New Sweden was established which colonized the northern part of the state, together with the Delaware Valley. Eventually, the Dutch, who had maintained that their claim to Delaware arose from the colony of 1631, recaptured Delaware and incorporated the colony into the Colony of New Netherland.\nHowever, shortly thereafter Delaware came under British control in 1664. James I of England had granted Virginia 400 miles of Atlantic coast centered on Cape Comfort, extending west to the Pacific Ocean to a company of colonists in a series of charters from 1606 to 1611. This included a piece of the peninsula. The land was transferred from the Duke of York to William Penn in 1682 and was governed with Pennsylvania. The exact border was determined by the Chancery Court in 1735. In 1776, the counties of Kent, New Castle, and Sussex declared their independence from Pennsylvania and entered the United States as the state of Delaware.\nIn the 1632 Charter of Maryland, King Charles I of England granted \"all that Part of the Peninsula, or Chersonese, lying in the Parts of America, between the Ocean on the East and the Bay of Chesapeake on the West, divided from the Residue thereof by a Right Line drawn from the Promontory, or Head-Land, called Watkin's Point, situate upon the Bay aforesaid, near the river Wigloo, on the West, unto the main Ocean on the East; and between that Boundary on the South, unto that Part of the Bay of Delaware on the North, which lieth under the Fortieth Degree of North Latitude from the Equinoctial, where New England is terminated\" to Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, as the colony of Maryland. This would have included all of present-day Delaware; however, a clause in the charter granted only that part of the peninsula that had not already been colonized by Europeans by 1632. Over a century later, it was decided in the case of \"Penn v Lord Baltimore\" that, because the Dutch had colonized Zwaanendael in 1631, the portion of Maryland's charter granting Delaware to Maryland was void.\nEconomy.\nThe peninsula was the premier location for truck farming of vegetables during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Though it has been largely eclipsed by California's production, the area still produces significant quantities of tomatoes, green beans, corn, soybeans\u2014Queen Anne's County is the largest producer of soy beans in Maryland\u2014and other popular vegetables.\nThe Eastern Shore is also known for its poultry farms, the most well-known of which is Perdue Farms, founded in Salisbury. The Delaware is a rare breed of chicken created on the peninsula.\nTourism is a major contributor to the peninsula's economy with the beaches at Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Ocean City, Maryland, Assateague Island National Seashore, Maryland, and Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge, Virginia, being popular tourist destinations.\nSalisbury University also adds to the economic activity of the Delmarva, with an estimated $480 million in contribution impact. The University is the largest four year comprehensive on the Eastern Shore, and serves as the largest employer other than Perdue supporting an estimated 3,200 jobs.\nMedia.\nThe area is served by four television markets. Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's, Caroline and Talbot Counties in Maryland are primarily served by the Baltimore, Maryland, designated market area and stations WBAL-TV, WJZ-TV, WMAR-TV and WBFF-TV. New Castle and Kent Counties in Delaware are served by the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, designated market area and stations WPVI-TV, WCAU-TV, KYW-TV and WTXF-TV. Sussex, Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester and Somerset Counties are served by the Salisbury, Maryland, designated market area, the only based on the peninsula. These stations are WBOC-TV, WMDT-TV, and WRDE-LD. Accomack and Northampton Counties are primarily served by the Norfolk/Virginia Beach designated market area and stations WAVY-TV, WVEC-TV and WTKR-TV.\nTransportation.\nThe peninsula has minor airports with few commercial carriers, as it is overshadowed by proximate major airports in Baltimore and Philadelphia. Its airports include Wilmington Airport southwest of Wilmington, Delaware, Salisbury Regional Airport to the southeast of Salisbury, Maryland, and Dover Air Force Base to the southeast of Dover, Delaware.\nMajor north\u2013south highways include U.S. 9, U.S. 13, U.S. 50 and U.S. 301. Highways U.S. 50 and U.S. 301 run over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge on the western side of the peninsula. U.S. 13 at the southern limit of the peninsula connects through the Chesapeake Bay Bridge\u2013Tunnel to the main part of Virginia.\nUntil 1957, the Pennsylvania Railroad provided service to the peninsula. It ran the \"Del-Mar-Va Express\" day train from New York City, through Wilmington, Dover, Delmar, Salisbury, and Pocomoke City to the Cape Charles, Virginia, ferry docks and it ran the \"Cavalier\" counterpart night train. At that point, ferries ran to Norfolk, Virginia. In earlier decades branches ran to Centreville, Maryland; Oxford, Maryland; Cambridge, Maryland; Georgetown and Lewes, Delaware; and to Franklin City, Virginia. Today, the Delmarva Central Railroad provides freight and tanker transportation on the peninsula.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It ensures the continuing function of a piece of software under unforeseen circumstances. Defensive programming practices are often used where high availability, safety, or security is needed.\nDefensive programming is an approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:\nOverly defensive programming, however, may safeguard against errors that will never be encountered, thus incurring run-time and maintenance costs.\nSecure programming.\nSecure programming is the subset of defensive programming concerned with computer security. Security is the concern, not necessarily safety or availability (the software may be allowed to fail in certain ways). As with all kinds of defensive programming, avoiding bugs is a primary objective; however, the motivation is not as much to reduce the likelihood of failure in normal operation (as if safety were the concern), but to reduce the attack surface \u2013 the programmer must assume that the software might be misused actively to reveal bugs, and that bugs could be exploited maliciously.\nint risky_programming(char *input) {\n char str[1000]; \n // ...\n strcpy(str, input); // Copy input.\n // ...\nThe function will result in undefined behavior when the input is over 1000 characters. Some programmers may not feel that this is a problem, supposing that no user will enter such a long input. This particular bug demonstrates a vulnerability which enables buffer overflow exploits. Here is a solution to this example:\nint secure_programming(char *input) {\n char str[1000+1]; // One more for the null character.\n // Copy input without exceeding the length of the destination.\n strncpy(str, input, sizeof(str));\n // If strlen(input) &gt;= sizeof(str) then strncpy won't null terminate. \n // We counter this by always setting the last character in the buffer to NUL,\n // effectively cropping the string to the maximum length we can handle.\n // One can also decide to explicitly abort the program if strlen(input) is \n // too long.\n str[sizeof(str) - 1] = '\\0';\nOffensive programming.\nOffensive programming is a category of defensive programming, with the added emphasis that certain errors should \"not\" be handled defensively. In this practice, only errors from outside the program's control are to be handled (such as user input); the software itself, as well as data from within the program's line of defense, are to be trusted in this methodology.\nTrusting internal data validity.\nconst char* trafficlight_colorname(enum traffic_light_color c) {\n switch (c) {\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED: return \"red\";\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return \"yellow\";\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN: return \"green\";\n return \"black\"; // To be handled as a dead traffic light.\nconst char* trafficlight_colorname(enum traffic_light_color c) {\n switch (c) {\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_RED: return \"red\";\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_YELLOW: return \"yellow\";\n case TRAFFICLIGHT_GREEN: return \"green\";\n assert(0); // Assert that this section is unreachable.\nTrusting software components.\nif (is_legacy_compatible(user_config)) {\n // Strategy: Don't trust that the new code behaves the same\n old_code(user_config);\n} else {\n // Fallback: Don't trust that the new code handles the same cases\n if (new_code(user_config) != OK) {\n old_code(user_config);\n// Expect that the new code has no new bugs\nif (new_code(user_config) != OK) {\n // Loudly report and abruptly terminate program to get proper attention\n report_error(\"Something went very wrong\");\n exit(-1);\nTechniques.\nHere are some defensive programming techniques:\nIntelligent source code reuse.\nIf existing code is tested and known to work, reusing it may reduce the chance of bugs being introduced.\nHowever, reusing code is not \"always\" good practice. Reuse of existing code, especially when widely distributed, can allow for exploits to be created that target a wider audience than would otherwise be possible and brings with it all the security and vulnerabilities of the reused code.\nWhen considering using existing source code, a quick review of the modules(sub-sections such as classes or functions) will help eliminate or make the developer aware of any potential vulnerabilities and ensure it is suitable to use in the project. \nLegacy problems.\nBefore reusing old source code, libraries, APIs, configurations and so forth, it must be considered if the old work is valid for reuse, or if it is likely to be prone to legacy problems.\nLegacy problems are problems inherent when old designs are expected to work with today's requirements, especially when the old designs were not developed or tested with those requirements in mind.\nMany software products have experienced problems with old legacy source code; for example:\nNotable examples of the legacy problem:\nCanonicalization.\nMalicious users are likely to invent new kinds of representations of incorrect data. For example, if a program attempts to reject accessing the file \"/etc/passwd\", a cracker might pass another variant of this file name, like \"/etc/./passwd\". Canonicalization libraries can be employed to avoid bugs due to non-canonical input.\nLow tolerance against \"potential\" bugs.\nAssume that code constructs that appear to be problem prone (similar to known vulnerabilities, etc.) are bugs and potential security flaws. The basic rule of thumb is: \"I'm not aware of all types of security exploits. I must protect against those I \"do\" know of and then I must be proactive!\".\nOther ways of securing code.\nThe three rules of data security.\nThese three rules about data security describe how to handle any data, internally or externally sourced:\nAll data is important until proven otherwise - means that all data must be verified as garbage before being destroyed.\nAll data is tainted until proven otherwise - means that all data must be handled in a way that does not expose the rest of the runtime environment without verifying integrity.\nAll code is insecure until proven otherwise - while a slight misnomer, does a good job reminding us to never assume our code is secure as bugs or undefined behavior may expose the project or system to attacks such as common SQL injection attacks."}

R. R. Tolkien's \"The Lord of the Rings\". He serves as a secondary antagonist there; his role is expanded in \"Unfinished Tales\". He is introduced in \"The Two Towers\" as the chief advisor to King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan and henchman of Saruman. \nTo some psychologists, Wormtongue serves as an archetypal sycophant. Tolkien scholars note that Tolkien based Wormtongue on the untrustworthy character Unferth in \"Beowulf\". He is presumptive, behaving as if he already rules Rohan, and exemplifies lechery, as correctly guessed by Gandalf; he hopes to become rich, and to take \u00c9owyn as the woman he desires. \nThe name \"Gr\u00edma\" derives from the Old English or Icelandic word meaning \"mask\", \"helmet\", or \"spectre\".\nAppearances.\n\"The Two Towers\".\nGr\u00edma, son of G\u00e1lm\u00f3d, is at first a faithful servant, but he falls in league with the traitorous wizard Saruman, and from then on works to weaken King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan and his kingdom through lies and persuasion, in his position as chief advisor to the King.\nTolkien describes him as \"a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face, and heavy lidded eyes\", and a \"long pale tongue\". Gr\u00edma is widely disliked in Edoras; everyone except Th\u00e9oden calls him \"Wormtongue\". In Old English \"wyrm\" means \"serpent, snake, dragon\", and Gandalf repeatedly compares him to a snake:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The wise speak only of what they know, Gr\u00edma son of G\u00e1lm\u00f3d. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;See, Th\u00e9oden, here is a snake! To slay it would be just. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and it did you service in its fashion.\nSaruman had promised him \u00c9owyn, the king's niece, as a reward for his services. Her brother \u00c9omer accuses him of \"watching her under his lids and haunting her steps\". His schemes are foiled when Gandalf the White and his companions arrived at Edoras, and convinces the king that he is not as weak as his adviser had made him seem. Upon Th\u00e9oden's restoration, \"many things which men had missed\" are found locked in Gr\u00edma's trunk, including the king's sword, Herugrim. Th\u00e9oden decides to go forth to battle at the Fords of Isen, and Gr\u00edma is given a choice: prove his loyalty and ride into battle with the king, or ride into exile. Choosing the latter, he goes to Saruman at Orthanc. Following the confrontation between Saruman and Gandalf, Gr\u00edma mistakenly throws the \"palant\u00edr\" of Orthanc at the Men of Rohan accompanying Gandalf, or possibly at Saruman himself, and so permits its capture by Peregrin Took.\n\"The Return of the King\".\nGr\u00edma accompanies Saruman to the Shire, where Saruman seeks revenge for his defeat at Orthanc in petty tyranny over the Hobbits. During this time, Saruman shortens Gr\u00edma's nickname to \"Worm\" in order to demean him. When Saruman is overthrown by a hobbit rebellion and ordered to leave, Frodo Baggins implores Gr\u00edma not to follow him, and even offers him food, shelter, and forgiveness. Saruman counters by revealing to the Hobbits that Gr\u00edma had murdered and possibly eaten Lotho Sackville-Baggins, a kinsman of Frodo; whereupon Gr\u00edma kills Saruman by slitting his throat, and is in turn shot by Hobbit archers.\n\"Unfinished Tales\".\nGr\u00edma plays a major role in the back-story to \"The Lord of the Rings\", prior to his first appearance in \"The Two Towers\". In \"Unfinished Tales\", Tolkien writes that Gr\u00edma is captured by the Nazg\u00fbl in the fields of the Rohirrim, while on his way to Isengard to inform Saruman of Gandalf's arrival at Edoras. He divulges what he knows of Saruman's plans to the Nazg\u00fbl, specifically his interest in the Shire, and its location. Gr\u00edma is set free, and the Nazg\u00fbl set out immediately for the Shire. In another version in the same chapter, this role is given to the \"squint-eyed southerner\" that the hobbits encounter at Bree. Tolkien further suggests that Gr\u00edma may have given Th\u00e9oden \"subtle poisons\" that cause him to age at an accelerated pace.\nAnalysis.\nTo the psychologists Deborah and Mark Parker, Wormtongue serves as an archetypal sycophant, flatterer, liar, and manipulator. \nTolkien scholars have noted that Wormtongue's interaction with Gandalf in Meduseld has an Old English counterpart in the epic poem \"Beowulf\": the account is closely based on the hero Beowulf's dealings with Unferth in Heorot, where Unferth is King Hrothgar's \"ambiguous\" spokesman; Unferth is thoroughly discredited by Beowulf, as Wormtongue is by Gandalf.\nThe critic Charles W. Nelson describes Wormtongue's attitude as an example of presumption, behaving \"as if he were already on the throne\" of Rohan. Nelson notes that Richard Purtill suggests that Tolkien is intentionally embodying the seven deadly sins in his characters. He quotes from one of Tolkien's letters to this effect: \"the encouragement of good morals in this real world, by the ancient device of exemplifying them in unfamiliar embodiments, that may tend to 'bring them home.'\" Clark writes that Dwarves exemplify greed, Men pride, Elves envy, Ents sloth, Hobbits gluttony, Orcs anger, and Wormtongue lechery. That lechery is, Nelson notes, correctly guessed by Gandalf: that he would gain a large share in Meduseld's treasure, and \u00c9owyn's hand in marriage, \"on whose person Grima had long cast lecherous eyes and lascivious looks\", and indeed in \u00c9omer's words that Grima had \"haunted her steps\".\nColleen Donnelly writes that Wormtongue and Gollum are both distorted characters, and both end up disloyal to their masters. Donnelly notes that they are both \"eaten up by desire\", but comments that where Wormtongue is irredeemably full of treason against his lord, King Th\u00e9oden of Rohan, Gollum remains open to kindness and can still intend to do good and honest service. Both characters end up unintentionally doing good through what seems to be an evil act: Wormtongue slits his master Saruman's throat, helping to end the harm being done to the hobbits' home, the Shire; while Gollum, desperate to get the One Ring, bites it off his master Frodo's finger and falls to his death, with the Ring, into the fires of Mount Doom, thus destroying the Ring and ending the Dark Lord Sauron's evil reign.\nPortrayal in adaptations.\nIn Ralph Bakshi's 1978 animated film adaptation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", Wormtongue was voiced by Michael Deacon.\nIn Peter Jackson's \"Lord of the Rings\" films, Wormtongue was played by Brad Dourif, described in \"The Guardian\" as an \"unnerving presence\" and in \"The Independent\" as a \"snivelling sidekick urging his master on to acts of increasing depravity\". According to Dourif, Jackson encouraged him to shave off his eyebrows so that the audience would immediately have a subliminal reaction of unease to the character.\n\"The Scouring of the Shire\" episode with the deaths of both Saruman and Wormtongue does not appear in the film version; the deaths were moved to an earlier scene, \"The Voice of Saruman\". The cut scene can be found on the Extended Edition DVD of \"\".\nReferences.\nPrimary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSecondary.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was Napoleon's second wife and as such Empress of the French and Queen of Italy from their marriage on 2 April 1810 until his abdication on 6 April 1814.\nAs the eldest child of Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor and Emperor of Austria, and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily, Marie Louise grew up during a period marked by ongoing and unceasing conflict between Austria and revolutionary France. A series of military defeats at the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte had inflicted a heavy human toll on Austria and led Francis to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire. The end of the War of the Fifth Coalition resulted in the marriage of Napoleon and Marie Louise in 1810, which ushered in a brief period of peace and friendship between Austria and the French Empire, much like prior alliances between the Austrian and French Royal family. Marie Louise agreed to the marriage despite being raised to despise France. She bore Napoleon a son, styled the King of Rome at birth, who briefly succeeded him as Napoleon II. Marie Louise's son was later titled Duke of Reichstadt.\nNapoleon's fortunes changed dramatically in 1812 after his failed invasion of Russia. The European powers, including Austria, resumed hostilities towards France in the War of the Sixth Coalition, which ended with the abdication of Napoleon and his exile to Elba. The 1814 Treaty of Fontainebleau gave the Duchies of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla to Marie Louise, who ruled the duchies until her death.\nMarie Louise married morganatically twice after Napoleon's death in 1821. Her second husband was Count Adam Albert von Neipperg (married 1821), an equerry she met in 1814. She and Neipperg had three children: Albertine, William Albert, and Mathilde. Neipperg died in 1829. Marie Louise married Count Charles-Ren\u00e9 de Bombelles, her chamberlain, in 1834. She died in Parma in 1847.\nEarly life.\nArchduchess Marie Louise of Austria (who was given the Latin baptismal name of \"Maria Ludovica Leopoldina Francisca Theresa Josepha Lucia\") was born at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna on 12 December 1791 to Archduke Francis of Austria and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was named after her grandmother, Marie Louise, Holy Roman Empress. Her father became Holy Roman Emperor a year later as Francis II. Marie Louise was a great-granddaughter of Empress Maria Theresa through both her parents, as they were double first cousins. She was also a maternal granddaughter of Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, Marie Antoinette's favorite sister. She was known as \"Luisel\" to her family.\nMarie Louise's formative years were during a period of conflict between France and her family. She was brought up to detest France and French ideas. Her upbringing was supervised by her French imperial governess Victoire de Folliot de Crenneville. Marie Louise was influenced by her grandmother Maria Carolina, who despised the French Revolution which ultimately caused the death of her sister, Marie Antoinette. Maria Carolina's Kingdom of Naples had also come into direct conflict with French forces led by Napoleon Bonaparte. The War of the Third Coalition brought Austria to the brink of ruin, which increased Marie Louise's resentment towards Napoleon. The Imperial family was forced to flee Vienna in 1805. Marie Louise took refuge in Hungary and later Galicia before returning to Vienna in 1806. Her father relinquished the title of Holy Roman Emperor but remained Emperor of Austria.\nTo make her more marriageable, her parents had her tutored in many languages. In addition to her native German, she became fluent in English, French, Italian, Latin, and Spanish. To maintain her purity, her parents allowed for little to no contact with men, and even all her animals, including a pet rabbit, were required to be female.\nIn 1807, when Marie Louise was 15, her mother died after suffering a miscarriage. Less than a year later, Emperor Francis married his first cousin Maria Ludovika Beatrix of Austria-Este, who was four years older than Marie Louise. Nonetheless, Maria Ludovika Beatrix took on a maternal role towards her stepdaughter. She was also bitter towards the French, who had deprived her father of the Duchy of Modena.\nAnother war broke out between France and Austria in 1809, which resulted in defeat for the Austrians again. The Imperial family had to flee Vienna again before the city surrendered on 12 May. Their journey was hampered by bad weather, and they arrived in Buda \"wet through, and nearly worn out with fatigue\".\nMarriage proposal.\nAfter escaping an assassination attempt in Vienna, while negotiating the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn on 12 October 1809, Emperor Napoleon decided that he needed an heir to cement his relatively young Empire. He also sought the validation and legitimization of his Empire by marrying a member of one of the leading royal families of Europe. He began proceedings to divorce Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, and per his family's wishes, he began searching for a new empress. His wish to marry Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia, the youngest sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, caused alarm in Austria, where they were afraid of being sandwiched between two great powers allied with each other. At the persuasion of Prince Metternich, a marriage between Napoleon and Marie Louise was suggested by Emperor Francis to the Count of Narbonne but no official overture was made by the Austrians. Though officials in Paris and Austria were beginning to accept the possibility of the union, Marie Louise was kept uninformed of developments.\nFrustrated by the Russians delaying the marriage negotiations, Napoleon rescinded his proposal in late January 1810 and began negotiations to marry Marie Louise with the Austrian ambassador, the Prince of Schwarzenberg. Schwarzenberg signed the marriage contract on 7 February. Marie Louise was informed of the marriage by Metternich. When asked for consent, she replied: \"I wish only what my duty commands me to wish.\"\nHowever, earlier in life, a young Marie Louise had referred to Napoleon as \"Krampus\" and even \"the Anti-Christ\" in her letters to her governess, and when word got to Marie Louise that Napoleon was searching for a wife, she wrote: \"I pity the poor princess whom he'll choose\". At the time of Napoleon's proposal, she actually hoped to marry Francis IV, Duke of Modena, who was the older brother of her step-mother.\nWedding.\nMarie Louise was married by proxy to Napoleon on 11 March 1810 at the Augustinian Church, Vienna. Napoleon was represented by Archduke Charles, the bride's uncle. According to the French ambassador, the marriage \"was celebrated with a magnificence that it would be hard to surpass, by the side of which even the brilliant festivities that have preceded it are not to be mentioned\". She became Empress of the French and Queen of Italy.\nMarie Louise departed Vienna on 13 March, probably expecting never to return. Upon arriving in France she was placed in the custody of Napoleon's sister, who had her put through a symbolic old ritual. Tradition dictated that a royal bride coming to France must keep nothing of her homeland, especially her clothing. Accordingly, Marie Louise was stripped of her dress, corset, stockings, and chemise, leaving her completely naked. Napoleon's sister then made the nude Marie take a bath. She was then redressed in French bridal clothes. Marie Antoinette had been put through a similar ritual when she arrived in France in 1770. Marie Louise met Napoleon for the first time on 27 March in Compi\u00e8gne, remarking to him: \"You are much better-looking than your portrait.\"\nThe civil wedding was held at the Saint James Church on 1 April 1810. The next day, Napoleon and Marie Louise made the journey to Paris in the coronation coach. The Imperial Guard cavalry led the procession, followed by the herald-at-arms and then the carriages. The Marshals of France rode on each side, near the doors of the carriages. The procession arrived at the Tuileries Palace, and the Imperial couple made their way to the Salon Carr\u00e9 chapel (in the Louvre) for the religious wedding ceremony. The ceremony was conducted by Cardinal Joseph Fesch, Grand Almoner of France and Napoleon's uncle. A Bridal March was composed for the occasion by Ferdinando Paer, and a cantata by Johann Nepomuk Hummel.\nElaborate celebrations continued to be held in May and June 1810. These included a ball, a masque, a sea-battle on the Seine, and a display of fireworks created by Claude-Fortun\u00e9 Ruggieri, for 4,000 people.\nBy this marriage, Napoleon became the great-nephew-in-law of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette.\nMarriage to Napoleon.\nLife as empress.\nMarie Louise was excited as Napoleon\u2019s wife and settled in quickly in the French court. She developed a close friendship with her \"Premi\u00e8re dame d'honneur\", the Duchess of Montebello, while most of the daily affairs were handled by her \"Dame d'atour\" Jeanne Charlotte du Lu\u00e7ay. Napoleon initially remarked that he had \"married a womb\" to an aide, but their relationship soon grew. He \"spared no pains\" to please her and claimed at one point to prefer Marie Louise to his first wife Jos\u00e9phine; while he had loved Jos\u00e9phine, and though he claimed Jos\u00e9phine remained his greatest friend even after their amicable divorce, and that he still would choose her, whereas with Marie Louise, there was \"Never a lie, never a debt\" \u2014 presumably a reference to Jos\u00e9phine's rumoured extramarital affairs and reputation as a spendthrift. Marie Louise wrote to her father: \"I assure you, dear papa, that people have done great injustice to the Emperor. The better one knows him, the better one appreciates and loves him.\" However, the marriage was not without tension; Napoleon sometimes remarked to aides that Marie Louise was too shy and timid, compared to the outgoing and passionate Josephine, with whom he remained in close contact, upsetting Marie Louise.\nThe excitement surrounding the wedding ushered in a period of peace and friendship between France and Austria, who had been largely at war for the last two decades. The people of Vienna, who hated Napoleon only months before, were suddenly in full praise of the French Emperor. Flattering letters were sent between Napoleon and Emperor Francis, Empress Maria Ludovika Beatrix and Archduke Charles during the wedding festivities.\nDuring public occasions, Marie Louise spoke little due to reserve and timidity, which some observers mistook for haughtiness. She was regarded as a quiet woman and never interfered in politics. Privately, she was polite and gentle.\nNapoleon arranged for Marie Louise to participate in some carefully selected charity assignments, most notably the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Charit\u00e9 Maternelle, for which he made her Honorary President.\nBirth of first child.\nMarie Louise became pregnant by July 1810 and gave birth to a son on 20 March 1811. The boy, Napol\u00e9on Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Charles Bonaparte, was given the title \"King of Rome\", in accordance with the practice where the heir apparent to the Holy Roman Empire was called the King of the Romans. Napoleon was delighted that his wife survived the ordeal and said: \"I had rather never have any more children than see her suffer so much again.\"\nMarie Louise was devoted to her son; she had him brought to her every morning and visited him in his apartment in the course of the day.\nResumption of war.\nIn May 1812, a month before the French invasion of Russia, Marie Louise accompanied Napoleon to Dresden, where she met her father and stepmother. Emperor Francis told Napoleon he could count on Austria for the \"triumph of the common cause\", a reference to the impending war. A minor rivalry began to develop between Marie Louise and the Empress of Austria, who was jealous at being upstaged in appearance by her stepdaughter. It was also in Dresden where she met Count Adam Albert von Neipperg for the first time. She would marry him morganatically after her husband Napoleon I died on St. Helena in 1821. Napoleon left Dresden on 29 May to take charge of his army.\nMarie Louise then travelled to Prague, where she spent a few weeks with the Austrian Imperial family, before returning to Saint Cloud on 18 July. She kept in touch with Napoleon throughout the war. The invasion of Russia ended disastrously for France. More than half of the \"Grande Arm\u00e9e\" was destroyed by the Russian Winter and guerrilla attacks. After the failed Malet coup of October 1812, Napoleon hastened his return to France and reunited with his wife on the night of 18 December.\nCollapse of the Empire.\nThe weakened French position triggered the Sixth Coalition. Prussia allied with Russia and declared war on France (the United Kingdom was already at war with France), but Austria stayed out due to relations between the Imperial families. On 30 March, Marie Louise was appointed Regent as Napoleon set off for battle in Germany. The regency was only \"de jure\", as all decisions were still taken by Napoleon and implemented by his most senior officials, including Lebrun, Joseph Bonaparte, Talleyrand and Savary. Marie Louise tried unsuccessfully to get her father to ally with France. Austria too joined the opposition to France. She maintained a correspondence with Napoleon, informing him of increasing demands for peace in Paris and the provinces. Napoleon was decisively defeated in Leipzig on 19 October and returned to Saint Cloud on 9 November.\nOn 23 January 1814, Marie Louise was appointed Regent for the second time. On 25 January, at 03:00 in the morning, Napoleon embraced Marie Louise and his son for the last time. He left to lead a hastily formed army to stave off the Allied invasion from the north.\nAs the Allies neared Paris, Marie Louise was reluctant to leave. She felt that as the daughter of the sovereign of Austria, one of the allied members, she would be treated with respect by Allied forces, with the possibility of her son succeeding the throne should Napoleon be deposed. She was also afraid that her departure would strengthen the royalist supporters of the Bourbons. Marie Louise was finally persuaded to leave by Henri Clarke, who received the order from Napoleon: \"I would prefer to know that they [the Empress and the King of Rome] are both at the bottom of the Seine rather than in the hands of the foreigners.\" On 29 March, the court left Paris. The Allies entered the city the following day.\nMarie Louise and the court moved to Blois, which was safe from the Allies. She did not expect her father to dethrone Napoleon and deprive her son of the crown of France. On 3 April, the Senate, at the instigation of Talleyrand, announced the deposition of the Emperor. Marie Louise was unaware of this until 7 April, and was astonished to discover the turn of events. She wanted to return to Paris, but was dissuaded from doing so by physician Jean-Nicolas Corvisart and the Duchess of Montebello.\nExile of Napoleon.\nNapoleon abdicated the throne on 11 April 1814 in Fontainebleau. The Treaty of Fontainebleau exiled him to Elba, allowed Marie Louise to retain her imperial rank and style and made her ruler of the duchies of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, with her son as heir. This arrangement was later revised at the Congress of Vienna.\nMarie Louise was strongly dissuaded from rejoining her husband by her advisors, who fed her accounts that Napoleon was distraught with grief over the death of Jos\u00e9phine. On 16 April, her father arrived at Blois to meet her. At the advice of Emperor Francis, Marie Louise departed Rambouillet with her son for Vienna on 23 April. At Vienna, she stayed at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, where she received frequent visits from her sisters, but rarely from her father and stepmother. She met her grandmother, Maria Carolina, who disapproved of her deserting her husband. Distressed at being seen as a heartless wife and indifferent mother, she wrote on 9 August 1814: \"I am in a very unhappy and critical position; I must be very prudent in my conduct. There are moments when that thought so distracts me that I think that the best thing I could do would be to die.\"\nCongress of Vienna and relationship with Neipperg.\nIn the summer of 1814, Emperor Francis sent Count Adam Albert von Neipperg to accompany Marie Louise to the spa town of Aix-les-Bains to prevent her from joining Napoleon on Elba. Neipperg was a confidant of Metternich and an enemy of Napoleon. Marie Louise fell in love with Neipperg. They became lovers. He became her chamberlain, and her advocate at the Congress of Vienna. News of the relationship was not received well by the French and the Austrian public.\nWhen Napoleon escaped in March 1815 and reinstated his rule, the Allies once again declared war. Marie Louise was asked by her stepmother to join in the processions to pray for the success of the Austrian armies but rejected the insulting invitation. She passed a message to Napoleon's private secretary, Claude-Fran\u00e7ois de M\u00e9neval, who was about to return to France: \"I hope he will understand the misery of my position ... I shall never assent to a divorce, but I flatter myself that he will not oppose an amicable separation, and that he will not bear any ill feeling towards me ... This separation has become imperative; it will in no way affect the feelings of esteem and gratitude that I preserve.\" Napoleon was defeated for the last time at the Battle of Waterloo and was exiled to Saint Helena from October 1815. Napoleon made no further attempt to contact her personally.\nThe Congress of Vienna recognised Marie Louise as ruler of Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla, but prevented her from bringing her son to Italy. It also made her Duchess of Parma for her life only, as the Allies did not want a descendant of Napoleon to have a hereditary claim over Parma. After her death, the duchy was to revert to the Bourbons.\nDuchess of Parma.\nMarie Louise departed for Parma on 7 March 1816, accompanied by Neipperg. She entered the duchy on 18 April. She wrote to her father: \"People welcomed me with such enthusiasm that I had tears in my eyes.\" She largely left the running of day-to-day affairs to Neipperg, who received instructions from Metternich. In December 1816, Marie Louise removed the incumbent Grand Chamberlain (prime minister) and installed Neipperg.\nShe and Neipperg had three children:\nNapoleon died on 5 May 1821. On 8 August, Marie Louise married Neipperg morganatically. Neipperg died of heart problems on 22 February 1829, devastating Marie Louise. She was banned by Austria from mourning in public. To replace Neipperg, Austria appointed Josef von Werklein as Grand Chamberlain.\nMarie Louise's son by Napoleon, then known as \"Franz\", was given the title \"Duke of Reichstadt\" in 1818. Franz lived at the Austrian court, where he was shown great affection by his grandfather, but was constantly undermined by Austrian ministers and nationalists, who did their best to sideline him to become an irrelevance. There were fears that he might be smuggled over to France to regain the throne, as he could be easily disguised as a girl. \nFranz grew resentful at his Austrian relatives and his mother for their lack of support, and began identifying as Napoleon II and surrounding himself with French courtiers. The relationship with his mother broke down when he became aware that his mother had borne two illegitimate children to Neipperg prior to their marriage; this occurred to such an extent that he once remarked \"If Josephine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried at Saint Helena, and I should not be at Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved; Josephine was.\" However, before anything could become of Napoleon II, he died at the age of 21 in Vienna in 1832, after suffering from tuberculosis.\n1831 saw the outbreak of the Carbonari-led uprisings in Italy. In Parma, protesters gathered in the streets to denounce Grand Chamberlain Werklein. Marie Louise did not know what to do and wanted to leave the city, but was prevented from doing so by the protesters, who saw her as someone who would listen to their demands. She managed to leave Parma between 14 and 15 February, and the rebels formed a provisional government, led by Count Filippo Luigi Linati. At Piacenza, she wrote to her father, asking him to replace Werklein. Francis sent in Austrian troops, which crushed the rebellion. To avoid further turmoil, Marie Louise granted amnesty to the dissidents on 29 September.\nTo replace Werklein, in 1833, Metternich sent Charles-Ren\u00e9 de Bombelles, a French \u00e9migr\u00e9 nobleman who had served in the Austrian army against Napoleon. Bombelles was an excellent Grand Chamberlain, who thoroughly reformed the finances of the duchy. A middle-aged widower, he also developed a close personal relationship with Marie Louise. Six months after his arrival, on 17 February 1834, she married him, again morganatically.\nDeath.\nMarie Louise fell ill on 9 December 1847. Her condition worsened for the next few days. On 17 December, she passed out after vomiting and never woke up again. She died in the evening. The cause of death was determined to be pleurisy.\nHer body was transferred back to Vienna and buried at the Imperial Crypt.\nArms.\nHer arms as Duchess of Parma are used as the logo of the perfume company Acqua di Parma. This is in homage to the role she played in helping to develop the perfume and glass industry of Parma.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

One of the most bankable stars in Hollywood during the 1980s and 1990s, her performances have earned her various accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and a British Academy Film Award, along with nominations for three Academy Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award.\nPfeiffer began her acting career with minor roles in television and film, before securing her first leading role in \"Grease 2\" (1982). She achieved wider recognition for her breakthrough performance as Elvira Hancock in \"Scarface\" (1983), which brought her mainstream success. This was followed by leading roles in \"The Witches of Eastwick\" (1987) and \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988). Pfeiffer received the first of six consecutive Golden Globe Award nominations for \"Married to the Mob\" (1988). She earned consecutive Academy Award nominations for \"Dangerous Liaisons\" (1988), for Best Supporting Actress, and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" (1989), for Best Actress, winning a Golden Globe Award for the latter.\nEstablished as one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1990s, Pfeiffer starred in \"The Russia House\" (1990) and \"Frankie and Johnny\" (1991). In 1992, she portrayed Catwoman in \"Batman Returns\", and received her third Academy Award nomination for \"Love Field\". She went on to appear in \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993) and \"Wolf\" (1994). Through her production company, Via Rosa Productions, she produced and starred in several films, including \"Dangerous Minds\" (1995). Pfeiffer reduced her workload in the 2000s to focus on her family, appearing in select projects such as \"What Lies Beneath\" (2000), \"White Oleander\" (2002), \"Hairspray\", and \"Stardust\" (both 2007).\nFollowing a hiatus, Pfeiffer returned to prominence in 2017 with roles in \"Where Is Kyra?\", \"Mother!\", and \"Murder on the Orient Express\". That same year, she received her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for portraying Ruth Madoff in the television film \"The Wizard of Lies\". In 2020, she earned her eighth Golden Globe Award nomination for \"French Exit\". Since 2018, Pfeiffer has portrayed Janet van Dyne in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\".\nEarly life.\nMichelle Marie Pfeiffer was born on April 29, 1958, in Santa Ana, California, to Richard Pfeiffer, an air-conditioning contractor, and Donna Jean (n\u00e9e Taverna), a housewife. She has an older brother, Rick, and two younger sisters, Dedee and Lori. Her parents were both originally from North Dakota. Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German-Italian descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. The family moved to Midway City, another Orange County community around seven miles (11\u00a0km) away, where Pfeiffer spent her early years.\nPfeiffer attended Fountain Valley High School, graduating in 1976. She worked as a check-out girl at Vons supermarket, and attended Golden West College where she was a member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority. After a short stint training to be a court stenographer, she pursued an acting career. Pfeiffer won the Miss Orange County beauty pageant in 1978 and finished sixth in the Miss California contest the same year. After her appearances in these pageants, Pfeiffer acquired an agent and began to audition for television and film roles.\nCareer.\nLate 1970s and 1980s.\nPfeiffer made her acting debut in 1978, in a one-episode appearance of \"Fantasy Island\". Other roles on television series followed, including \"Delta House\", \"CHiPs\", \"Enos\" and \"B.A.D. Cats\", as well as in the made-for-CBS film \"The Solitary Man\" (1979). Pfeiffer transitioned to film with the comedy \"The Hollywood Knights\" (1980), with Tony Danza, appearing as high school sweethearts. She subsequently played supporting roles in \"Falling in Love Again\" (1980) with Susannah York and \"Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen\" (1981), none of which met with much critical or box office success. She appeared in a television commercial for Lux soap, and took acting lessons at the Beverly Hills Playhouse, before appearing in three 1981 television movies \u2013 \"Callie and Son\", with Lindsay Wagner, \"The Children Nobody Wanted\" and \"Splendor in the Grass\".\nPfeiffer obtained her first starring film role as the female lead in \"Grease 2\" (1982), the sequel to the smash-hit musical film \"Grease\" (1978). With only a few television roles and small film appearances, the 23-year-old Pfeiffer was an unknown actress when she attended the casting call audition for the role, but according to director Patricia Birch, she won the part because she \"has a quirky quality you don't expect\". The film was a critical and commercial failure but Pfeiffer's performance was noted as a standout. \"The New York Times\" remarked: \"[A]lthough she is a relative screen newcomer, Miss Pfeiffer manages to look much more insouciant and comfortable than anyone else in the cast.\" Despite escaping the critical mauling, her agent later admitted that her association with the film meant that \"she couldn't get any jobs. Nobody wanted to hire her.\" On her early screen roles, she asserted: \"I needed to learn how to act ... in the meantime, I was playing bimbos and cashing in on my looks.\"\nDirector Brian De Palma, having seen \"Grease 2\", refused to audition Pfeiffer for \"Scarface\" (1983), but relented at the insistence of Martin Bregman, the film's producer. She was cast as cocaine-addicted trophy wife Elvira Hancock. The film was considered excessively violent by most critics, but became a commercial hit and gained a large cult following in subsequent years. Pfeiffer received positive reviews for her supporting turn; Richard Corliss of \"Time Magazine\" wrote, \"most of the large cast is fine: Michelle Pfeiffer is better ...\" while Dominick Dunne, in an article for \"Vanity Fair\" titled \"Blonde Ambition\", wrote, \"[s]he is on the verge of stardom. In the parlance of the industry, she is hot.\"\nFollowing \"Scarface\", she played Diana in John Landis' comedy \"Into the Night\" (1985), with Jeff Goldblum; Isabeau d'Anjou in Richard Donner's fantasy film \"Ladyhawke\" (1985), with Rutger Hauer and Matthew Broderick; Faith Healy in Alan Alda's \"Sweet Liberty\" (1986), with Michael Caine; and Brenda Landers in a segment of the 1950s sci-fi parody \"Amazon Women on the Moon\" (1987), all of which, despite achieving only modest commercial success, helped to establish her as an actress. She finally scored a major box-office hit as Sukie Ridgemont in the 1987 adaptation of John Updike's novel \"The Witches of Eastwick\", with Jack Nicholson, Cher, and Susan Sarandon. The film received positive reviews and grossed over $63.7\u00a0million domestically, equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024 dollars, becoming one of her earliest critical and commercial successes. Praising their comic timing, Roger Ebert wrote that Pfeiffer and her female co-stars each \"have a delicious good time with their roles\", while the \"Los Angeles Times\" film critic Sheila Benson said Pfeiffer makes her character \"a warm, irresistible character.\"\nPfeiffer was cast against type, as a murdered gangster's widow, in Jonathan Demme's mafia comedy \"Married to the Mob\" (1988), with Matthew Modine, Dean Stockwell and Mercedes Ruehl. For the role of Angela de Marco, she donned a curly brunette wig and a Brooklyn accent, and received her first Golden Globe Award nomination as Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, beginning a six-year streak of consecutive Best Actress nominations at the Golden Globes. Pfeiffer then appeared as chic restaurateuse Jo Ann Vallenari in \"Tequila Sunrise\" (1988) with Mel Gibson and Kurt Russell, but experienced creative and personal differences with director Robert Towne, who later described her as the \"most difficult\" actress he has ever worked with.\nAt Demme's personal recommendation, Pfeiffer joined the cast of Stephen Frears's \"Dangerous Liaisons\" (1988), with Glenn Close and John Malkovich, playing Madame Marie de Tourvel, the virtuous victim of seduction. Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" saw Pfeiffer's role as \"the least obvious and the most difficult. Nothing is harder to play than virtue, and Pfeiffer is smart enough not to try. Instead, she embodies it. Her porcelain-skinned beauty, in this regard, is a great asset, and the way it's used makes it seem an aspect of her spirituality.\" She won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role and received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\nPfeiffer then accepted the role of Susie Diamond, a hard-edged former call girl turned lounge singer, in \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" (1989), which also starred Jeff Bridges and Beau Bridges as the eponymous Baker Boys. She underwent intense voice training for the role for four months, and performed all of her character's vocals. The film was a modest success, grossing $18.4\u00a0million in the US and Canada (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024 dollars ). Her portrayal of Susie, however, drew unanimous acclaim from critics. Critic Roger Ebert compared her to Rita Hayworth in \"Gilda\" and to Marilyn Monroe in \"Some Like It Hot\", adding that the film was \"one of the movies they will use as a document, years from now, when they begin to trace the steps by which Pfeiffer became a great star\". During the 1989\u20131990 awards season, Pfeiffer won as Best Actress at the Golden Globes, the National Board of Review, the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the Chicago Film Critics Association. Pfeiffer's performance as Susie is considered to be the most critically acclaimed of her career. The scene in which her character seductively performs \"Makin' Whoopee\" atop a grand piano is considered to be a memorable scene in modern cinema.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, Pfeiffer formed her own film production company, Via Rosa Productions, with business partner Kate Guinzburg, whom she had met on the set of \"Sweet Liberty\" (1986). The company was under a picture deal with Touchstone Pictures, a film label of The Walt Disney Studios. That year, Pfeiffer began earning $1\u00a0million per film, and took on the part of the Soviet book editor Katya Orlova in the film adaptation of John le Carr\u00e9's \"The Russia House\", with Sean Connery, a role that required her to adopt a Russian accent. For her efforts, she was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama. Pfeiffer then landed the role of damaged waitress Frankie in Garry Marshall's \"Frankie and Johnny\" (1991), a film adaptation of Terrence McNally's Broadway play \"Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune\", which reunited her with her \"Scarface\" co-star, Al Pacino. The casting was seen as controversial by many, as Pfeiffer was considered far too beautiful to play an \"ordinary\" waitress; Kathy Bates, the original Frankie on Broadway, also expressed disappointment over the producers' choice. Pfeiffer herself stated that she took the role because it \"wasn't what people would expect of [her]\". Pfeiffer was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama for her performance.\nPfeiffer took on the role of Selina Kyle\u2013Catwoman in Tim Burton's superhero film \"Batman Returns\" (1992), opposite Michael Keaton and Danny DeVito, after Annette Bening dropped out because of her pregnancy. For the role, she trained in martial arts and kickboxing. Pfeiffer received unanimous critical acclaim for her portrayal, which is often referred to as the greatest performance of Catwoman of all time by critics and fans. \"Premiere\" retrospectively stated: \"Arguably the outstanding villain of the Tim Burton era, Michelle Pfeiffer's deadly kitten with a whip brought sex to the normally neutered franchise. Her stitched-together, black patent leather costume, based on a sketch of Burton's, remains the character's most iconic look. And Michelle Pfeiffer overcomes \"Batman Returns\"' heavy-handed feminist dialogue to deliver a growling, fierce performance.\" \"Batman Returns\" was a big box office success, grossing over $267\u00a0million worldwide.\nThe first film her company produced was the independent drama \"Love Field\", which was released in 1992. Reviewers embraced the film and \"The New York Times\" felt that Pfeiffer was \"again demonstrating that she is as subtle and surprising as she is beautiful\". For her portrayal of an eccentric Dallas, Texas housewife, she earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the Golden Globe for Best Actress \u2013 Drama and won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. In Martin Scorsese's period drama \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993), a film adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel, Pfeiffer starred with Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder, portraying a Countess in upper-class New York City in the 1870s. For her role, she received the Elvira Notari Prize at the Venice Film Festival, and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture. That year, she was awarded the Women in Film Los Angeles' Crystal Award.\nFollowing the formation of her producing company, Via Rosa Productions, Pfeiffer saw a professional expansion as a producer. While she continued to act steadily throughout the decade, she and her producing partner Guinzburg experienced a winning streak of producing back to back films next under their header. She starred with Jack Nicholson in the 1994 horror film \"Wolf\", portraying the sardonic and willful interest of a writer who becomes a wolf-man at night after being bitten by a creature. The film was released to a mixed critical reception; \"The New York Times\" wrote: \"Ms. Pfeiffer's role is underwritten, but her performance is expert enough to make even diffidence compelling.\" \"Wolf\" was a commercial success, grossing $65\u00a0million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in 2024) at the domestic box office and $131\u00a0million worldwide (equivalent to $\u00a0million).\nPfeiffer's next role was that of high school teacher and former United States Marine LouAnne Johnson in the drama \"Dangerous Minds\" (1995), co-produced by her company. She appeared as her character in the music video for the soundtrack's lead single, \"Gangsta's Paradise\" by Coolio, featuring L.V.; the song won the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance, and the video won the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video. While \"Dangerous Minds\" received negative reviews, it was a box office success, grossing $179.5\u00a0million around the globe. In 1996, Pfeiffer portrayed Sally Atwater in the romantic drama \"Up Close &amp; Personal\", with Robert Redford, took on the titular role in the drama \"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\", which was adapted by her husband David Kelley from Michael Brady's play of the same name, and served as an executive producer and starred as the divorced single mother architect Melanie Parker in the romantic comedy \"One Fine Day\", with George Clooney.\nSubsequent performances included Rose Cook Lewis in the film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"A Thousand Acres\" (1997) with Jessica Lange and Jennifer Jason Leigh; Beth Cappadora in \"The Deep End of the Ocean\" (1998) about a married couple who found their son who was kidnapped nine years ago; Titania the Queen of the Fairies in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" (1999) with Kevin Kline, Rupert Everett and Stanley Tucci; and Katie Jordan in Rob Reiner's comedy drama \"The Story of Us\" (1999) with Bruce Willis. \"A Thousand Acres\" and \"The Deep End of the Ocean\" were also produced by Via Rosa Productions. Pfeiffer voiced Tzipporah, a shepherdess who becomes the wife of Moses (voiced by Val Kilmer), in DreamWorks Animation's \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998), a musical adaptation based on the Book of Exodus. She also recorded the film's theme song \"When You Believe\", for which songwriter Stephen Schwartz won the Academy Award for Best Original Song. \"The Prince of Egypt\" was released to critical and commercial success, but Kenneth Turan found the film's modernization of Pfeiffer's character into a \"feisty protofeminist\" to be problematic.\n2000s.\nPfeiffer began to dissolve her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and moved into semi-retirement to spend more quality time with her children and family. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called \"Original Sin\" (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.\nIn \"What Lies Beneath\" (2000), a Hitchcockian thriller directed by Robert Zemeckis, Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office, and went on to gross $291\u00a0million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama \"I Am Sam\" (2001), with Sean Penn. Despite grossing $97.8\u00a0million worldwide, the film was unfavorably reviewed by critics; \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" wrote: \"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland clich\u00e9s that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever.\" Meanwhile, \"SF Gate\" observed: \"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material.\"\nPfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist, named Ingrid Magnussen, in the drama \"White Oleander\" (2002), with Alison Lohman (in her film debut), Ren\u00e9e Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was a critical and commercial success in its arthouse release. Stephen Holden of \"The New York Times\" wrote that \"Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical.\" Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described her as \"incandescent\", bringing \"power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator\" in a \"riveting, impeccable performance\". She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.\nIn 2003, Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in ', an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was \"too sexual\", then she lacked fun. After a third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \"You know, you really can fire me,\" but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. During this time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film ' (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton.\nPfeiffer returned to cinemas in 2007 with villainous roles in two summer blockbusters, \"Hairspray\" and \"Stardust\", which was hailed as a successful comeback by the media. In the former, a film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, she starred alongside John Travolta, Christopher Walken and Queen Latifah as Velma Von Tussle, the racist manager of a television station. Although a fan of Pfeiffer's work in the musicals \"Grease 2\" and \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\", director Adam Shankman cast Pfeiffer largely based on her performance in \"Batman Returns\", claiming she was his first and only choice for Velma. Although she had fun with the part, Pfeiffer described Velma as the most difficult role she had played at the time, because of her character's racism; but she was drawn to the film's important message of anti-bigotry, accepting that \"in order to do a movie about racism, somebody has got to be the racist\". Released to widely positive reviews, \"Hairspray\" grossed $202.5\u00a0million worldwide. Pfeiffer's performance was also critically acclaimed, with film critic David Edelstein of NPR calling her \"sublime\". The cast of \"Hairspray\" was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Cast in a Motion Picture, and won the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast, the Hollywood Film Festival Award for Ensemble of the Year, and the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Ensemble Cast. In the fantasy adventure \"Stardust\", Pfeiffer plays Lamia, an ancient witch who hunts a fallen star (Claire Danes) in search of eternal youth. The film received mostly positive reviews but performed moderately at the box office, earning $135.5\u00a0million globally. \"The New York Times\" film critic Stephen Holden described Pfeiffer as \"as deliciously evil a witch as the movies have ever invented\", writing that she \"goes for broke with the relish of a star who figures she has nothing to lose.\"\nPfeiffer starred in Amy Heckerling's romantic comedy \"I Could Never Be Your Woman\" (2007), with Paul Rudd and Saoirse Ronan, portraying Rosie, a forty-year-old divorced mother working as a scriptwriter and producer for a television show who falls in love with a much younger man (Rudd). Her reported salary was $1\u00a0million, with an advance on fifteen percent of the gross. However, the film was only distributed on home video markets domestically. Reviews for \"I Could Never Be Your Woman\" were moderately positive, with critic James Berardinelli finding Pfeiffer and Rudd to \"have adequate chemistry to pull off the romance,\" in what he described as an \"enjoyable romantic comedy that has enough going for it to make it worth a recommendation.\" Pfeiffer starred in \"Personal Effects\", with Ashton Kutcher, playing two grieving people coping with the pain and frustration of their loss whose bond spawns an unlikely romance. The drama premiered at Iowa City's Englert Theatre in December 2008.\nHer next film, an adaptation of Colette's \"Ch\u00e9ri\", reunited her with the director (Stephen Frears) and screenwriter (Christopher Hampton) of \"Dangerous Liaisons\" (1988). Pfeiffer played the role of aging retired courtesan L\u00e9a de Lonval, with Rupert Friend in the title role, with Kathy Bates as his mother. \"Ch\u00e9ri\" premiered at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival, where it received a nomination for the Golden Bear award. \"The Times\" of London reviewed the film favorably, describing Hampton's screenplay as a \"steady flow of dry quips and acerbic one-liners\" and Pfeiffer's performance as \"magnetic and subtle, her worldly nonchalance a mask for vulnerability and heartache\". Roger Ebert in the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" wrote that it was \"fascinating to observe how Pfeiffer controls her face and voice during times of painful hurt\". Kenneth Turan in the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the \"wordless scenes that catch L\u00e9a unawares, with the camera alone seeing the despair and regret that she hides from the world. It's the kind of refined, delicate acting Pfeiffer does so well, and it's a further reminder of how much we've missed her since she's been away.\"\n2010s.\nFollowing a two-year sabbatical from acting, Pfeiffer made part of a large ensemble cast in Garry Marshall's ensemble romantic comedy \"New Year's Eve\" (2011), her second collaboration with Marshall after \"Frankie and Johnny\". The film, also starring Halle Berry, Jessica Biel, Robert De Niro, Josh Duhamel, Zac Efron, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Sof\u00eda Vergara, among many others, saw her take on the supporting role of Ingrid Withers, an overwhelmed secretary befriending a deliveryman (Efron). While the film was panned by critics, it made $142\u00a0million worldwide. In 2012, she appeared with Chris Pine and Elizabeth Banks in the drama \"People Like Us\", as the mother of a struggling New York City corporate trader (Pine). \"Rolling Stone\" found her to be \"luminous\" in the film, and \"The New York Times\", positively pointing out Pfeiffer and Banks, noted that their performances \"partly compensate for the holes in a story whose timing is hard to swallow\". \"People Like Us\" debuted to $4.26\u00a0million, described as \"meager\" by Box Office Mojo, and only made $12\u00a0million in North America.\nPfieffer reunited with Tim Burton, her \"Batman Returns\" director, in \"Dark Shadows\" (2012), based on the gothic television soap opera of the same name. In the film, co-starring Johnny Depp, Eva Green, Helena Bonham Carter and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, she played Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, the matriarch of the Collins family. Critical response towards the film was mixed, but writers acclaimed the actors' performances\u2014most notably Depp and Pfeiffer's. \"IGN\" found her to be \"commanding\" in her role and felt that the main characters were \"played by one of Burton's best ensemble casts yet\". While \"Dark Shadows\" grossed a modest $79.7\u00a0million in North America, it ultimately made $245.5\u00a0million globally. In Luc Besson's mob-comedy \"The Family\" (2013), co-starring Robert De Niro, Tommy Lee Jones, Dianna Agron and John D'Leo, she played the \"tough mother\" in a Mafia family wanting to change their lives under the witness protection program. Although reviews for the film were mixed, \"THV11\" said on the cast's portrayals: \"The core actors of \"The Family\" were really solid, and the whole film comes together to make a solid movie.\" An article in \"HuffPost\" said that \"De Niro, Pfieffer and Jones all brought 100% to their roles.\" The film grossed $78.4\u00a0million worldwide.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe only trepidation was I think I took for granted how nice it was to not be under the spotlight and just having a life. I remember thinking, \"Do I really want to step back into this?\" And I just realized that I'm not done. I have a lot more to do, and a lot more to say. I'm never going to be one that retires.\n\u2014 Pfeiffer on her comeback, 2017\nPfeiffer stated that her lack of acting throughout the 2000s was due to several reasons, including family matters and her approach to choosing roles. She stated she was intending to \"work a lot\" once her children left for college, mentioning that she felt her best performance was \"still in her\", saying how that's what she felt kept her going.\nIn the independent drama \"Where Is Kyra?\" (2017), Pfeiffer starred as a sensitive and fragile woman who loses her mother and \"faces a crisis in which she must find a means for survival, all the while hiding her struggles from her new lover\". The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2017, and received a limited release on April 6, 2018, to critical acclaim; Her role as \"Kyra\" was called the \"performance of her life\" by \"Village Voice\"'s Bilge Ebiri, and \"the performance of her career\", by \"Rolling Stone\".\nPfeiffer landed the role of Ruth Madoff for the HBO Films drama \"The Wizard of Lies\" (2017), based on the book of the same name. The film, directed by Barry Levinson, reunites her with actor Robert De Niro, who played her husband, disgraced financier Bernard Madoff. \"The Wizard of Lies\" premiered on HBO on May 20, 2017, garnering favorable reviews from critics and an audience of 1.5\u00a0million viewers, HBO's largest premiere viewership for a film in four years. \"Tolucan Times\" remarked that Pfeiffer \"steals the show as Madoff's wife, Ruth, and is a remarkable lookalike\", while \"Los Angeles Times\" asserted: \"As Ruth, Pfeiffer convincingly portrays a pampered woman left with utterly nothing \u2014she's lost her homes, status and, most important, her relationship with her sons.\" She received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Movie, in addition to a Golden Globe Award nomination.\nIn Darren Aronofsky's psychological horror film \"Mother!\" (2017), Pfeiffer portrayed one of the mysterious guests who interrupt the tranquil life of a couple, played by Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem. Although \"Mother!\" divided critics and audiences, reviewers praised Pfeiffer unanimously, and some found her performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. \"Vulture\" remarked: \"Out of the main actors, it's Pfeiffer who is able to root the character in meaning \u2014 she bracingly marries the exploration of Biblical creation, mythological overtones, and hellish domestic commentary. There's a gravity to Pfeiffer's performance that allows her to succeed where the other main actors fail, save for brief spurts \u2014 she straddles the boundaries between embodying a symbol and granting the character enough interiority to feel like a flesh and blood woman, too.\"\nPfeiffer played a widowed socialite in Kenneth Branagh's \"Murder on the Orient Express\" (2017), the fourth screen adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1934 novel of the same name. Featuring an ensemble cast, the mystery film follows world-renowned detective Hercule Poirot (Branagh) attempting to solve a murder, while stranded with several suspects on the Orient Express during the 1930s. She also recorded the original song \"Never Forget\" for the film's soundtrack. The film grossed $351.7\u00a0million worldwide and received decent reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, but criticism for not adding anything new to previous adaptations. Although some critics found its large cast underused, Pfeiffer's performance was praised, with Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" saying she delivered the film's best performance. \"The New Yorker\"'s Anthony Lane found that only Pfeiffer appears to be enjoying their material, while Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" credited the film with reminding audiences that she is one of the industry's best actresses. David Edelstein of \"Vulture\" described the actress as \"a hoot and a half ... stealing every scene\".\nPfeiffer debuted in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Janet van Dyne, the original Wasp, in the \"Ant-Man\" (2015) sequel \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018). Variety\"s Owen Gleiberman described her performance as \"lovely\" and \"wistful\", while Josh Spiegel of /Film believed the film suffers from a lack of the actress. In 2019, Pfeiffer briefly reprised the role in ', and starred alongside Angelina Jolie and Elle Fanning in the dark fantasy sequel \"\", playing the villainous Queen Ingrith. Despite the film earning mixed reviews, \"The Plain Dealer\"'s Laura DeMarco felt that both Jolie and Pfeiffer \"clearly relish their roles.\"\n2020s.\nPfeiffer headlined the dark comedy \"French Exit\" (2020), based on the acclaimed novel of the same name by Patrick deWitt, directed by Azazel Jacobs. In the film, which co-stars Lucas Hedges and Tracy Letts, Pfeiffer played a widow who moves to Paris, France, with her son (Hedges) and cat, who happens to be her reincarnated husband (Letts). The film premiered at the New York Film Festival, to a positive reception. Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" remarked that she gave a performance \"for which she'll be remembered.\" Pfeiffer received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.\nPfeiffer portrayed former First Lady Betty Ford in the anthology drama television series \"The First Lady\", which premiered on Showtime in April 2022. The following year, she reprised the role of Janet van Dyne in \"\". Manohla Dargis declared her the film's M.V.P.\nPfeiffer is attached to star alongside Annette Bening in the psychological thriller, \"Turn of Mind\", set to be directed by Gideon Raff. In 2022, she was cast in \"Wild Four O'Clocks\", penned and directed by Peter Craig, and produced by Marc Platt and Adam Siegel.\nOn March 18, 2024, it was announced that Pfeiffer had been cast in the Amazon MGM holiday comedy, \"Oh. What. Fun.\" (2025) On August 8, 2024, it was announced that she would star in, as well as executive produce, the \"Yellowstone\" spin-off \"The Madison\". On September 23, 2024, it was announced that Pfeiffer would star alongside Nicole Kidman and Elle Fanning in the Apple TV+ television series, \"Margo's Got Money Troubles\".\nActing style and reception.\nPfeiffer said she sometimes feels fraudulent as an untrained actor due to her lack of conventional schooling. She credits director Milton Katselas with teaching her the difference between how an actor and their character would behave during the same scene. Essayist Angelica Jade Basti\u00e9n said Pfeiffer's talent disproves any argument that untrained actors are lesser than their trained peers. Several film critics have described her as \"a character actress in a screen siren's body\", with Basti\u00e9n profiling her as \"a character actress reluctantly placed in Hollywood\u2019s lineage of blonde bombshells\". Journalist James Kaplan reported that some critics feel Pfeiffer has undersold herself by choosing character roles instead of capitalizing on her beauty. In 1993, film critic Ty Burr argued that her \"unshowy performances work because they don\u2019t call attention to themselves\", although her attractiveness prevents her from being seriously considered \"one of today\u2019s best screen actresses\". Pfeiffer claims she rarely accepts glamorous roles because she finds few of them compelling. Although she prefers acting in dramas over comedies, she does not have a favorite genre to perform in.\nDuring the 1980s, Pfeiffer typically played smart, funny, and independent women, and pursued a wider range of roles in the 1990s. Early in her career, she mostly played relatable working class women, aside from the occasional upper class character. She has admitted she enjoys playing imperfect, evil, and \"slightly trashy\" women. In a 2021 profile, journalist Lynn Hirschberg said Pfeiffer excels in emotionally conflicted roles, while Adam Platt of \"New Woman\" and journalist Bilge Ebiri agreed that she often plays emotionally detached women. \"Backstage\" contributor Manuel Betancourt observed parallels between Pfeiffer's characters and her own determination to subvert expectations, with the actress confirming that she searches new projects for relatability. However, \"Town &amp; Country\" senior editor Adam Rathe finds Pfeiffer dissimilar to most of her characters. Known to be highly selective about potential projects, Pfeiffer, according to IndieWire contributor Kate Erbland, carefully chooses unconventional roles to avoid being typecast. Pfeiffer's colleagues have described her as extremely committed, competent, and prepared, although she refuses to watch her own performances.\nPfeiffer has been called one of the greatest actresses of her generation. However, she has also been described as one of Hollywood's most underrated, with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" saying she \"is too seldom ranked among the best of her generation\". In 2009, journalist Brian D. Johnson argued that Pfeiffer had yet to demonstrate her true range, believing she could potentially be as revered as Meryl Streep if afforded the same acting opportunities, while film critic Mick LaSalle remarked that Pfeiffer's humility sometimes causes the public to overlook her as one of the industry's finest actresses. Film critic Pauline Kael named Pfeiffer one of her favorite actresses, saying she always tried to see her work. Pfeiffer is particularly renowned for her versatility, having accrued a filmography that spans period, romance, fantasy, musical, comedy, and drama. By 2016, \"Salon\"'s Charles Taylor declared that no actor of the previous decade had rivaled Pfeiffer's versatility. Summarizing her career as eclectic, Erbland believes she has rarely repeated acting choices, with the actress confirming she had always aspired to play the widest possible range of characters, even when her options were limited.\nPfeiffer was one of the highest-paid actresses of the 1980s and 1990s, typically earning $9\u2013$10 million per film during the latter decade. Aside from \"The Witches of Eastwick\", few of her films during the 1980s were major box office successes. In 1995, \"The New York Times\" journalist Bernard Weinraub said Pfeiffer belongs to a group of respected actresses who are \"not considered a big box-office draw\". However, several critics reported that her performances were consistently acclaimed, despite some mediocre films and box office returns. Regardless, Pfeiffer was the sixth highest-grossing domestic box office star of 1990, and one of the few actresses whose salary corresponded with their box office appeal as of 1996, according to UPI. In 1996, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked her the 67th greatest movie star of all time. By 1999, \"Variety\" named Pfeiffer \"the female movie star most likely to improve a film's box-office appeal\". In 2004, \"People\" ranked her among The 100 Greatest Movie Stars of Our Time, naming her 20th in the \"icons\" category.\nPfeiffer was awarded a motion picture star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007. She was honored by TCL Chinese Theater on April 25, 2025 with a hand and footprints ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theatre.\nPublic image.\nPfeiffer has been described as one of the world's most beautiful and talented actresses. After being typecast in early roles based on her appearance, she initially struggled to convince directors to take her seriously as an actor, and thus sought out more challenging opportunities. Journalists Candice Russell of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" and Rachel Syme of \"The New Yorker\" observed that, early in her career, critics regularly undermined Pfeiffer's work by focusing on her appearance instead of her acting.\nPfeiffer was considered one of the leading sex symbols of the 1980s and 1990s, and several publications dubbed her one of the era's \"It girls\". In 1990, Pfeiffer appeared on the inaugural cover of \"People\" magazine's annual \"50 Most Beautiful People in the World\" issue. She has been featured in the \"Most Beautiful\" issue a record-breaking six times throughout the decade (from 1990 to 1993, and in 1996 and 1999). In 2004, the magazine named her one of the most beautiful women of all time. In 2011, the \"Los Angeles Times Magazine\" featured her among the \"50 Most Beautiful Women in Film\". In 2020, \"Vogue Paris\" listed Pfeiffer as one of the 21 most beautiful American actresses of all time. \"Men's Health\" ranked Pfeiffer 45th and 67th on their all-time hottest women and sex symbol rankings, respectively. Pfeiffer has been famously self-deprecating about her own appearance, at times mocking her trademark features. At least two of her films, \"Stardust\" (2007) and \"Ch\u00e9ri\" (2009), explore beautiful, youth-obsessed women struggling to accept aging, themes Pfeiffer personally identified with. According to several plastic surgeons, she possesses some of the most requested celebrity features among clients. In 2001, plastic surgeon Stephen R. Marquardt declared Pfeiffer the most beautiful face in Hollywood. Nicknamed the \"golden ratio\", Pfeiffer's face, Marquardt claims, adheres to a mathematical formula in which he determined a person's ideal mouth is 1.618 times as wide as their nose. Several outlets have commented on Pfeiffer's perceived ability to physically age slowly.\nFamously private like the characters she plays, Matthew Jacobs of \"HuffPost\" crowned Pfeiffer Hollywood's foremost \"movie star who doesn't walk around feeling like a movie star\", which he believes allows her to play authentic characters without letting her fame compromise her talent. Analyzing her public profile for the repertory cinema Metograph, Luke Goodsell said few stars of the 1990s were as elusive as Pfeiffer, writing, \"Though a sex symbol, she was never a femme fatale like Sharon Stone; she could play quirky and romantic, but she wasn\u2019t an American sweetheart like Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan; a serious talent, she was rarely considered in the company of Meryl Streep or Jodie Foster\". Pfeiffer is notorious for disliking giving press interviews. Describing herself as \"the worst interviewee that ever was\", she believes it is not an actor's responsibility to promote a film project. Film critic Michael Sragow observed that the actress can at times appear \"flustered or elusive\" during interviews. In 1995, journalist Timothy Egan likened profiling Pfeiffer in the past to covering geology, a quality he said she had since outgrown. Vikram Murthi of \"The Nation\" believes Pfeiffer's aversion to publicity \"has lent her an air of gravitas, of someone who directs a spotlight rather than chases after it\".\nMedia commentators noted that Pfeiffer had unexpectedly become a \"pop-music muse\" in 2014; her name is mentioned in two of the year's most popular songs: \"Uptown Funk\" by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars, and \"Riptide\" by Vance Joy. Joy was particularly inspired by Pfeiffer's transformation from Selina Kyle into Catwoman in \"Batman Returns\", whereas Ronson cited \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" as his favorite Pfeiffer film. In 2021, singer-songwriter Ethel Cain released her debut single \"Michelle Pfeiffer\", which the artist named after the actress because \"I've always ... thought she was a picture perfect bombshell\". Australian cricketers speak of \"getting a Michelle\" when they take five wickets in an innings. In cricketing parlance, this is referred to as a \"five for\", a near-homophone for \"Pfeiffer\", which resulted in the nickname \"Michelle\". \"M3GAN 2.0\" (2025) director, Gerard Johnstone, revealed that Pfeiffer was the original inspiration behind the film's counterpoint robot, AMELIA.\nOther ventures.\nProduct and endorsements.\nIn 2005, Pfeiffer served as the face of Giorgio Armani's spring campaign; the designer has often dressed her for public appearances.\nIn 2019, she launched a collection of fine fragrances called Henry Rose. It is the first fine fragrance line to be both Cradle to Cradle Certified and EWG Verified. \nIn 2025, Pfeiffer fronted fashion house Yves Saint Laurent's Summer 2025 collection.\nPhilanthropy.\nHaving been a smoker for ten years (she quit in 1992), and having a niece who suffered from leukemia for ten years, Pfeiffer decided to support the American Cancer Society. She also supports the Humane Society. In 2016, she attended the Healthy Child Healthy World's L.A. Gala for people who lead organizations for children's environmental health. In December that year, Pfeiffer, who was vegan at the time, joined the board of directors for Environmental Working Group, an advocacy group based in Washington. D.C.\nPersonal life.\nSoon after coming to Hollywood at age twenty, Pfeiffer was taken in by a seemingly friendly couple who ran a metaphysics and vegetarian cult. They helped her to cease drinking, smoking, and doing drugs. Over time, they took control of her entire life. Much of her money went to the group. \"I was brainwashed,\" she said, \"I gave them an enormous amount of money.\"\nAt an acting class taught by Milton Katselas in Los Angeles, she met fellow budding actor Peter Horton, and they began dating. They married in Santa Monica in 1981; it was on their honeymoon that she discovered she had won the lead role in \"Grease 2\". Horton directed Pfeiffer in a 1985 ABC TV special, \"One Too Many\", where she played the high school girlfriend of an alcoholic student (Val Kilmer). In 1987, the real-life couple played an on-screen couple in the 'Hospital' segment of John Landis's comedy skit compilation \"Amazon Women on the Moon\".\nIn 1988, Pfeiffer had an affair with John Malkovich, her co-star in \"Dangerous Liaisons\", who at the time was married to Glenne Headly.\nPfeiffer and Horton decided to separate in 1988, and were divorced two years later. Horton later blamed the split on their devotion to their work rather than their marriage. Pfeiffer then had a three-year relationship with actor/producer Fisher Stevens, whom Pfeiffer met when she was starring as Olivia in the New York Shakespeare Festival production of \"Twelfth Night\", where Stevens played Sir Andrew Aguecheek.\nIn 1993, Pfeiffer married television writer and producer David E. Kelley. She made a brief uncredited cameo appearance in one episode of Kelley's television series \"Picket Fences\" and played the title character in \"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday\", for which Kelley wrote the screenplay. She had entered into private adoption proceedings before she met Kelley, and in March 1993 adopted a newborn daughter, Claudia Rose, who was christened on Pfeiffer's and Kelley's wedding day. In 1994, Pfeiffer gave birth to a son, John Henry Kelley II, named for his grandfather and Pfeiffer's father-in-law, United States Hockey Hall of Fame coach John Henry \"Jack\" Kelley. In September 2025, Pfeiffer revealed that she had become a grandmother in 2024.\nPfeiffer experimented with a plant-based diet for a few years but later added meat to her diet and advocated a \"paleoish\" diet.\nActing credits and accolades.\nAccording to review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, Pfeiffer's most acclaimed films include \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" (1989), \"\" (2019), \"Dangerous Liaisons\" (1988), \"Hairspray\" (2007), \"Married to the Mob\" (1988), \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018), \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993), \"Batman Returns\" (1992), \"Scarface\" (1983), \"Where Is Kyra?\" (2017), \"The Prince of Egypt\" (1998), and \"Stardust\" (2007).\nPfeiffer has received three Academy Award nominations: Best Supporting Actress for \"Dangerous Liaisons\" (1988); and Best Actress for \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\" (1989) and \"Love Field\" (1992). She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama for \"The Fabulous Baker Boys\", and has been nominated seven more times for her performances in \"Married to the Mob\" (1988), \"The Russia House\" (1990), \"Frankie and Johnny\" (1991), \"Love Field\", \"The Age of Innocence\" (1993), \"The Wizard of Lies\" (2017), and \"French Exit\" (2020). For \"Dangerous Liaisons\", she won the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She also received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for \"The Wizard of Lies\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She finds and views the tape; it contains strange and frightening imagery. She then receives a phone call from an unknown caller who whispers, \"Seven days\". Though initially skeptical, Rachel quickly begins to experience supernatural occurrences linked to the tape.\nRachel recruits the help of her video analyst ex-husband Noah. He views the tape and Rachel makes him a copy. She identifies a woman on the tape: horse breeder Anna Morgan, who killed herself after some of her horses drowned themselves off Moesko Island. Rachel and Noah's 8-year-old son Aidan watches the tape. Aidan also possesses supernatural abilities, which he uses to help with Rachel's investigation.\nRachel heads for Moesko Island to speak to Anna's widower Richard; en route, a horse aboard the ferry kills itself by jumping overboard. Rachel discovers that Anna, after four consecutive miscarriages, had adopted a young girl named Samara, who possessed the ability to psychically etch images onto objects and into people's minds, tormenting her parents and their horses. Meanwhile, Noah travels to Gale Psychiatric Hospital and finds a psychiatric file on Samara, which contains a missing video last seen by Richard.\nReturning to the Morgan home, Rachel finds a fake birth certificate proving that Samara is not the biological child of Richard and Anna. She also discovers the missing video, where Samara apologizes for her actions but explains that \"they won't stop\". Richard insists that Samara is evil and electrocutes himself. Noah and Rachel find a loft in the barn, which the Morgans used to isolate Samara from themselves and the outside world. There is an image of a tree behind the wallpaper; Rachel recognizes it as a tree at the Shelter Mountain Inn.\nThey return to Shelter Mountain Inn, led to a well beneath the floorboards. Rachel falls inside and experiences a vision of Anna dumping Samara into the well, where she survived for one week. Samara's body surfaces from the water. After Rachel is rescued, they arrange a proper burial for Samara.\nBack home, Aidan warns Rachel that it was a mistake to help Samara. Rachel realizes that Noah's week is up; Samara's ghost crawls out of his TV screen and kills him. Rachel realizes that Samara\u2019s apology was actually a confession and that she was only spared since she made a copy of the cursed video and passed it to Noah, fulfilling Samara's goal of killing endlessly. She helps Aidan make a copy of the tape and refuses to answer his question on what would happen to the person that watches it.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;* Naomi Watts as Rachel Keller\nProduction.\nDevelopment and casting.\n\"The Ring\" went into production without a completed script. Ehren Kruger wrote three drafts of the screenplay before Scott Frank came on to do an uncredited re-write. Gore Verbinski was initially inspired to do a remake of \"Ring\" after Walter F. Parkes sent him a VHS copy of the Japanese film, which he described as \"intriguing\", \"pulp\" and \"avant-garde\".\nThe original WGA-approved credits listed Hiroshi Takahashi (writer of the original 1998 screenplay for \"Ring\"), but his name is absent from the final print.\nSeveral high-profile actresses were offered the lead role, including Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Connelly and Kate Beckinsale. Verbinski admitted to not wanting to cast \"big stars\" as he wanted his film to be \"discovered\" and described the wave of harsh criticism from hardcore fans of the original Japanese film as \"inevitable\", although he expressed desire for them to find the remake equally compelling. He also sought to retain the minimalism prevalent throughout \"Ring\" and set it in Seattle, due to its \"wet and isolated\" atmosphere.\nFilming.\n\"The Ring\" was filmed in 2001, primarily in the State of Washington in numerous locations, including Seattle, Port Townsend, Whidbey Island, Bellingham, Monroe and Stanwood. The Yaquina Head Lighthouse in Newport, Oregon, was also used as a filming location, as well as Oregon's Columbia River Gorge.\nChris Cooper played a murderer in two scenes meant to bookend the film but was ultimately cut.\nCinematographer Bojan Bazelli used soft lighting and a grey blue-green color. Shot on film, the production is unusual for achieving its color correction in-camera using 81EF and one of two green filters, thereby committing to its visual style early, rather than relying on digital grading during post-production. The soft lighting was achieved by \"diffusing the fill sources enough to match [the natural lighting]\" through the use of up to three layers of shades, HMIs and CTB, and set up to create as little shadow as possible to \"subconsciously alter the viewer's sense of perception and add a heightened sense of ambiguity.\"\nTitle.\nAs with the original Japanese film \"Ring\", the title of \"The Ring\" can be interpreted as referring to the telephone call which warns those who watched the cursed tape that they will die in seven days, as well as to the view of the ring of light seen from the bottom of the well where Samara was left to die.\nScore.\n\"The Ring\" features an original score composed and arranged by Hans Zimmer (who later collaborated on Verbinski's other works). The soundtrack release did not coincide with the original 2002 theatrical run. It was released in 2005, accompanying \"The Ring\"'s 2005 sequel in an album that combined music from both the first and second film. The soundtrack contains a few themes associated with the characters, moods and locations, including multiple uses of the Dies irae theme. The score makes use of string instruments, pianos and synthesizers.\nRelease and reception.\nMarketing.\nTo advertise \"The Ring\", many promotional websites were formed featuring characters and places in the film. The video from the cursed videotape was played in late-night programming over the summer of 2002 without any reference to the film. Physical VHS copies were also randomly distributed outside of movie theaters by placing the tapes on the windshields of people's cars.\nBox office.\n\"The Ring\" opened theatrically on October 18, 2002, in the United States, on 1,981 screens, and grossed $15 million during its opening weekend. It went on to become a sleeper hit, leading DreamWorks to expand its release to 700 additional theaters. It ultimately grossed $129.1 million in the United States. In Japan, it earned $8.3 million in the first two weeks of its release. Worldwide, \"The Ring\" grossed a total of $249.3 million.\nCritical response.\nOn the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, \"The Ring\" has an approval rating of 71% based on 210 reviews and an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \"With little gore and a lot of creepy visuals, \"The Ring\" gets under your skin, thanks to director Gore Verbinski's haunting sense of atmosphere and an impassioned performance from Naomi Watts\". Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 57 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave \"The Ring\" an average grade of \"B\u2212\" on an A+ to F scale.\nOn \"Ebert &amp; Roeper\", Richard Roeper gave it a \"Thumbs Up\" and said it was very gripping and scary despite some minor unanswered questions. Roger Ebert gave the film \"Thumbs Down\" and felt it was boring and \"borderline ridiculous\"; he also disliked the extended, detailed ending. Jeremy Conrad from \"IGN\" praised \"The Ring\" for its atmospheric set up and cinematography, and said that \"there are disturbing images ... but the film doesn't really rely on gore to deliver the scares\". \"Film Threat\"'s Jim Agnew called it dark, disturbing and original.\nDespite the praise given to the direction, some criticized the lack of character development. Jonathan Rosenbaum from the \"Chicago Reader\" said that \"The Ring\" was \"an utter waste of Watts ... perhaps because the script didn't bother to give her a character\", whereas William Arnold from the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\" disagreed, saying that she projects intelligence, determination and resourcefulness. Several critics, like \"Miami Herald\"'s Rene Rodriguez and \"USA Today\"'s Claudia Puig, thought \"The Ring\" did not make sense despite its explanations.\nLegacy.\nThe success of \"The Ring\" paved the way for American remakes of several other Asian and Japanese horror films, including \"The Grudge\" (2004), \"Dark Water\" (2005), \"Shutter\" and \"The Eye\" (both 2008).\n\"The Ring\" ranked number 20 on the cable channel Bravo's list of \"The 100 Scariest Movie Moments\". Bloody Disgusting ranked it sixth in their list of the \"Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade\", with the article saying that \"\"The Ring\" was not only the first American 'J-horror' remake out of the gate; it also still stands as the best\".\nSequels.\nA sequel, titled \"The Ring Two\", was released on March 18, 2005. A short film, titled \"Rings\", was also released in 2005, and is set between \"The Ring\" and \"The Ring Two\". A third installment, also titled \"Rings\", was released on February 3, 2017.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62671", "revid": "20549476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62671", "title": "Acadia National Park", "text": "National park in Maine, United States\nAcadia National Park is a national park of the United States located along the mid-section of the Maine coast, southwest of Bar Harbor. The park includes about half of Mount Desert Island, part of Isle au Haut, the tip of the Schoodic Peninsula, and portions of sixteen smaller outlying islands. \nThe park contains the tallest mountain on the Atlantic Coast of the United States (Cadillac Mountain), exposed granite domes, glacial erratics, U-shaped valleys, and cobble beaches. Its mountains, lakes, streams, wetlands, forests, meadows, and coastlines contribute to a diversity of plants and animals. Woven into this landscape is a historic carriage road system financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. In total, it encompasses as of 2017[ [update]].\nAcadia has a rich human history, dating back more than 10,000 years ago with the Wabanaki people. The 17th century brought fur traders and other European explorers, while the 19th century saw an influx of summer visitors, then wealthy families. Many conservation-minded citizens, among them George B. Dorr (the \"Father of Acadia National Park\"), worked to establish this first U.S. national park east of the Mississippi River and the only one in the Northeastern United States. Acadia was initially designated Sieur de Monts National Monument by proclamation of President Woodrow Wilson in 1916, then renamed and redesignated Lafayette National Park in 1919. The park was renamed Acadia National Park in 1929.\nRecreational activities from spring through autumn include car and bus touring along the Park Loop Road; hiking, bicycling, and horseback riding on carriage roads (motor vehicles are prohibited); fishing; rock climbing; kayaking and canoeing on lakes and ponds; swimming at Sand Beach and Echo Lake; sea kayaking and guided boat tours on the ocean; and various ranger-led programs. Winter activities include cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, snowmobiling, and ice fishing. Two campgrounds are located on Mount Desert Island, another campground is on the Schoodic Peninsula, and five lean-to sites are on Isle au Haut. The main visitor center is at Hulls Cove, northwest of Bar Harbor. Park visitation has been steadily increasing in Acadia over the past decade, with 2021 seeing a record count of 4.07 million visitors. In 2023 the park saw 3,879,890 recreational visitors.\nGeography.\nThe park includes mountains, an ocean coastline, woodlands, lakes, and ponds. In addition to nearly half of Mount Desert Island, the park designation also preserves a portion of the Schoodic Peninsula on the mainland, as well as the majority of Isle au Haut and Baker Island, all of Bar Island, three of the four Porcupine Islands (Sheep, Bald and Long), the Thrumcap (an islet), part of Bear Island, and Thompson Island in Mount Desert Narrows, as well as several other islands and islets. Bar Island, which can be visited on foot over a sandbar around low tide, and the Porcupine Islands are in Frenchman Bay by Bar Harbor. About of carriage roads were designed and financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. on Mount Desert Island, of which continue to be maintained inside the park.\nAcadia National Park encompasses a total of as of \u00a031, 2017[ [update]]. At least on Mount Desert Island are included in the park, along with on Isle au Haut, about on smaller islands, and on the Schoodic Peninsula. As of 2015[ [update]], the permanent park boundary, as established by act of Congress in 1986, included of privately owned land under conservation easements managed by the National Park Service, which plans to acquire the land at some point.\nFeatures.\nThe mountains of Acadia National Park overlook the Atlantic ocean, island lakes, and pine forests. Twenty-six significant mountains rise in the park, ranging from at Flying Mountain's summit to at Cadillac Mountain's summit. Cadillac Mountain, named after the French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac, is on the eastern side of the island. Cadillac is the tallest mountain along the eastern coastline of the United States. The summit of Cadillac is the first place in the United States where one may watch the sunrise from October 7 through March 6, due to its eastern location and height.\nThe Park Loop Road leads to many scenic viewpoints along the coast, through forests and to the top of Cadillac Mountain. The road traverses the eastern side of Mount Desert Island in a one-way, clockwise direction from Bar Harbor to Seal Harbor, passing features such as the Tarn (a pond), Champlain Mountain (location of a popular, exposed cliffside trail named Precipice), the Beehive (another, smaller mountain), Sand Beach (a saltwater swimming area), Gorham Mountain, Thunder Hole (a crevasse into which waves crash loudly), Otter Cliff, Otter Cove, Seal Harbor, Jordan Pond, Pemetic Mountain, the Bubbles, Bubble Rock, Bubble Pond, Eagle Lake, and the side road to the summit of Cadillac Mountain. Some of the island's west side features include Echo Lake and beach (a designated freshwater swimming area), Acadia Mountain, Beech Mountain, Long Pond, and Seal Cove Pond. Bass Harbor Head Light is situated atop a cliff on the southernmost tip of the west side of the island. Baker Island Light and Bear Island Light are the other two lighthouses managed by Acadia.\nSomes Sound is a long fjard formed during a glacial period that nearly divides the island in half. The sound is deep at its deepest point, and is bordered by Norumbega Mountain to the east, and Acadia Mountain and Saint Sauveur Mountain to the west. The towns of Southwest Harbor and Northeast Harbor face one another across the inlet to Somes Sound.\nHistory.\nNative people.\nNative Americans have inhabited the area called Acadia for at least 12,000 years, including the coastal areas of Maine, Canada, and adjacent islands. The Wabanaki Confederacy (\"People of the Dawnland\") consists of five related Algonquian nations\u2014the Maliseet, Mi'kmaq, Passamaquoddy, Abenaki and Penobscot. Some of the nations call Mount Desert Island \"Pemetic\" (\"range of mountains\"), which has remained at the center of the Wabanaki traditional ancestral homeland and territory of traditional stewardship responsibility to the present day. The etymology of the park's name begins with the Mi'kmaq term \"akadie\" (\"piece of land\") which was rendered as \"l'Acadie\" by French explorers, and translated into English as Acadia.\nThe Wabanaki traveled to the island in birch bark canoes to hunt, fish, gather berries, harvest clams and basket-making resources like sweetgrass, and to trade with other Wabanakis. They camped near places like Somes Sound.\nIn the early 17th century, Asticou was the chieftain of the greater Mount Desert Island area, one district of an intertribal confederacy known as Mawooshen led by the grandchief Bashaba. Castine (\"Pentagoet\" in the native language) was the grandchief's favored rendezvous site for the Wabanaki tribes. The site is located just west of Mount Desert Island at the mouth of the Bagaduce River in eastern Penobscot Bay. From 1615, Castine developed into a major fur trading post where French, English, and Dutch traders all fought for control. Sealskins, moose hides, and furs were traded by the Wabanakis for European commodities. By the early 1620s, warfare and introduced diseases, including smallpox, cholera and influenza, had decimated the tribes from Mount Desert Island southward to Cape Cod, leaving about 10 percent of the original population.\nThe border established between the United States and Canada after the American Revolution split the Wabanaki homelands. The confederacy was dissolved around 1870 due to pressure from the American and Canadian governments, though the tribal nations continued to interact in their traditional ways. In the nineteenth century, Wabanakis sold handmade ash and birch bark baskets to travelers. The Wabanaki performed dances for summer tourists and residents at Sieur de Monts and the town of Bar Harbor. Wabanaki guides led canoe trips around Frenchman Bay and the Cranberry Islands.\nFor two years, 1970\u201371, the nations operated a Wabanaki educational center called T.R.I.B.E. (Teaching and Research in Bicultural Education) on the west side of Eagle Lake. American Indian land claims in Maine were legally settled in 1980 and 1991. The annual Bar Harbor Native American Festival began in 1989, jointly sponsored by the tribes and the Abbe Museum. The Maine Indian Basketmakers Alliance was formed in 1993, assisting in the coordination of the annual festival with the museum.\nCurrently, each tribe has a reservation and government headquarters located within their territories throughout Maine. Some Wabanakis live on Mount Desert Island, while others visit for board meetings at the Abbe Museum, to advise on and perform in exhibitions, for craft demonstrations, and to gather sweetgrass and sell handmade baskets at the annual festival.\nExploration.\nThe Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed along the coast of Mount Desert Island during an expedition for the French Crown in 1524. He was followed by Est\u00eav\u00e3o Gomes, a Portuguese explorer for the Spanish Crown in 1525. French explorer Jean Alfonse arrived in 1542. Alfonse entered Penobscot Bay and recorded details about the fur trade. Portuguese navigator Simon Ferdinando guided an English expedition in 1580.\nA few hundred people were living on Mount Desert Island when Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1604. Two Wabanakis led Champlain to Mount Desert Island, which he named Isle des Monts Deserts (Island of Barren Mountains) due to its barren peaks; he named Isle au Haut (High Island) due to its height.\nWhile he was sailing down the coast on 5 September 1604, Champlain wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;That same day we also passed near an island about four or five leagues [] in length, off which we were almost lost on a little rock, level with the surface of the water, which made a hole in our pinnace close to the keel. The distance from this island to the mainland on the north is not a hundred paces. It is very high and cleft in places, giving it the appearance from the sea of seven or eight mountains one alongside the other. The tops of them are bare of trees, because there is nothing there but rocks. The woods consist only of pines, firs, and birches.\nSettlement.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe first French missionary colony in America was established on Mount Desert Island in 1613. The colony was destroyed a short time later by an armed vessel from the Colony of Virginia as the first act of overt warfare in the long struggle leading to the French and Indian Wars. The island was granted to Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac by Louis XIV of France in 1688, but ceded to England in 1713. Massachusetts governor Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet assumed control of the island in 1760. In 1790, Massachusetts granted the eastern half of the island to Cadillac's granddaughter, Mme. de Gregoire, while Bernard's son John retained ownership of the western half. The first record of summer visitors vacationing on the island was in 1855, and steamboat service from Boston was inaugurated in 1868. The Green Mountain Cog Railway was built from the shore of Eagle Lake to the summit of Cadillac Mountain in 1888. In 1901, the Maine Legislature granted Hancock County a charter to acquire and hold land on the island in the public interest. The first land was donated by Mrs. Eliza Homans of Boston in 1908, and had been acquired by 1914.\nRusticators.\nArtists and journalists had revealed and popularized the island in the mid-1800s. Painters came from the Hudson River School, including Thomas Cole and Frederic Church, inspiring patrons and friends to visit. The term \"rusticator\" was used to describe these early visitors who stayed in the homes of local fishermen and farmers for modest fees. The accommodations soon became insufficient for the increasing amount of summer visitors, and by 1880, thirty hotels were operating on the island. Tourism was becoming the major industry.\nCottagers.\nFor a select few Americans, the 1880s and the Gay Nineties meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert Island, being remote from the cities of the east, became a summer retreat for families such as the Rockefellers, Morgans, Fords, Vanderbilts, Carnegies, and Astors. These families, with the help of developers such as Charles T. How, constructed elegant estates, which they called cottages. Luxury, refinement, and large gatherings replaced the buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of the rusticators. For more than forty years, the wealthy dominated summer activity on Mount Desert Island, but the Great Depression and World War II brought an end to the extravagance.\nPark origins.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe landscape architect Charles Eliot is credited with the idea for the park. George B. Dorr, called the \"Father of Acadia National Park\", along with Eliot's father Charles W. Eliot (president of Harvard from 1869 to 1909), supported the idea both through donations of land and through advocacy at the state and federal levels. Dorr later served as the park's first superintendent. President Woodrow Wilson first established its federal status as Sieur de Monts National Monument on July 8, 1916, administered by the National Park Service. It was the first national park created from private lands gifted to the public.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have entered on an important work; we have succeeded until the Nation itself has taken cognizance of it and joined with us for its advancement...No one who had not made the study of it which I have can realize how various and truly wonderful the opportunities are which the creation of this Park now opens, alike in wild life ways and splendid scenery. To lose by want of action now what will be so precious to the future, whether for the delight of men or as a means to study, would be no less than tragic.\u2014\u200a\nCongress redesignated the national monument as Lafayette National Park on February 26, 1919, the first American national park east of the Mississippi River and the only one in the Northeastern United States. The park was named after the Marquis de Lafayette, an influential French participant in the American Revolution. Jordan Pond Road was started in 1922 and completed as a scenic motor highway in 1927. The Cadillac Mountain Summit Road, begun in 1925, was completed in 1931.\nThe name of the park was changed to Acadia National Park on January 19, 1929, in honor of the former French colony of Acadia, which once included Maine. In 1929 Schoodic Peninsula was donated to Acadia by John Godfrey Moore's second wife Louise and daughters Ruth and Faith. Keeping up with the taxes on the Schoodic land became a drain on the family finances and they thought this would be a fitting way to honor John Godfrey Moore. There was an unspoken stipulation in the discussions \u2014 the heirs were anglophiles that did not want to have their land as part of Lafayette National Park. Conservationist George Dorr suggested the name Acadia, and the deal went through after the name changed, ensuring the expansion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFrom 1915 to 1940, the wealthy philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. financed, designed, and directed the construction of a network of carriage roads throughout the park. He sponsored the landscape architect Beatrix Farrand, whose family owned a summer home in Bar Harbor named Reef Point Estate, to design the planting plans for the carriage roads (c. 1930). The network originally encompassed about of crushed stone carriage roads with 17 stone-faced, steel-reinforced concrete bridges (16 financed by Rockefeller), and two gate lodges\u2014one at Jordan Pond and the other near Northeast Harbor. About of carriage roads are maintained and accessible within park boundaries. Granite coping stones along carriage road edges act as guard rails; they are nicknamed \"Rockefeller's Teeth.\" The carriage roads are open from the end of the spring mud season, generally in late April, through the summer, autumn, and winter months, until the following spring thaw causes another closure in March to prevent damage to the gravel surface.\nAcadia National Park's first naturalist, Arthur Stupka, also had the distinction of being the first NPS naturalist to serve in any of the NPS's eastern United States districts. He joined the park staff in 1932, and in the capacity of park naturalist he wrote, edited and published a four-volume serial entitled \"Nature Notes from Acadia\" (1932\u20131935).\nFire of 1947.\nBeginning on October 17, 1947, more than of Acadia National Park burned in a fire that also destroyed an additional of Mount Desert Island outside the park. The fire began along Crooked Road west of Hulls Cove (northwest of Bar Harbor). The forest fire was one of a series of fires that consumed much of Maine's forest in a dry year. The fire burned until November 14, and was fought by the Coast Guard, Army Air Corps, Navy, local residents, and National Park Service employees from around the country. Sixty-seven of the historic summer cottages along Millionaires\u2019 Row, along with 170 other homes, and five hotels were destroyed. Restoration of the park was substantially supported by the Rockefeller family. Regrowth has occurred naturally with new deciduous forests consisting of birch and aspen enhancing the colors of autumn foliage, adding diversity to tree populations, and providing for the eventual regeneration of spruce and fir forests.\nClimate.\nThe region is characterized by a large seasonal variation in temperature with warm to hot summers that are often humid, and cold to severely cold winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Mount Desert Island has a warm-summer humid continental climate (\"Dfb\"). The average annual temperature in the park is 47.3\u00a0\u00b0F (8.5\u00a0\u00b0C). July is the warmest month with an average of 69.7\u00a0\u00b0F (20.9\u00a0\u00b0C), while January is the coldest month with an average of 23.8\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22124.6\u00a0\u00b0C). The record high and low temperatures are 96\u00a0\u00b0F (36\u00a0\u00b0C) and \u221221\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221229\u00a0\u00b0C), respectively. The plant hardiness zone is 5b with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of \u221211.4\u00a0\u00b0F (\u221224.1\u00a0\u00b0C).\nAverage annual precipitation in Bar Harbor is 55.54\" (1411\u00a0mm). November is the wettest month with 5.89\" (150\u00a0mm) of precipitation on average, while July is the driest month with 3.27\" (83\u00a0mm). Precipitation days are spread evenly throughout the year with December averaging the most days with about 14, while August averages the least with about 9. The annual average days with precipitation is 139. Snow has been recorded from October to May, although the majority falls from December to March. The snowiest month is January with 18.3\" (46\u00a0cm), and the annual average is 66.1\" (167\u00a0cm).\nGeology.\nThe Cadillac Mountain Intrusive Complex is part of the Coastal Maine Magmatic Province, consisting of over a hundred mafic and felsic plutons associated with the Acadian Orogeny. Mount Desert Island bedrock consists mainly of Cadillac Mountain granite. Perthite gives the granite its pinkish color. The Silurian age granite ranges from 424 to 419 million years ago (Mya). Diabase dikes trend north\u2013south through the complex. Almost 300 million years of erosion followed before the deposition of glacial features during the Pleistocene. Glacial polish, glacial striations, and chatter marks are evident in granitic surfaces. Other glacier-shaped features include The Bubbles (two r\u00f4che moutonn\u00e9es) and the U-shaped valleys of Sargent Mountain Pond, Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, Long Pond, Echo Lake, and Eagle Lake. Somes Sound is a fjard and terminal moraines form the southern end of Long Pond, Echo Lake, and Jordan Pond. Bubble Rock is an example of a glacial erratic.\nBedrock formation.\nMore than 500 Mya, layers of mud, sand and volcanic ash were buried beneath the ocean where high pressure, heat and tectonic activity created a metamorphic rock formation called the Ellsworth Schist. White and gray quartz, feldspar, and green chlorite comprise the schist, which is the oldest rock in the Mount Desert Island region. Erosion and shifting of tectonic plates eventually brought the schist to the surface.\nAbout 450 Mya, an ancient continental fragment, or micro-terrane, called Avalonia collided with North America. The collision buried the schist along with accumulations of sand and silt, creating the Bar Harbor Formation which consists of brown and gray sandstone and siltstone layers. Material from volcanic flows and ash were also deposited on the formation, creating the volcanic rock found on the Cranberry Islands. Further volcanic activity introduced igneous rocks into the Bar Harbor Formation. As the igneous intrusions cooled, crystallized minerals formed including a gabbro composed of dark, iron-rich minerals.\nMount Desert Island granite was created about 420 Mya, with one of the oldest granite bodies being Cadillac Mountain, the largest on the island. The granite body rose slowly through bedrock, fracturing it into large pieces, some of which melted under intense heat. As the granite cooled, the bedrock fragments were left surrounded by crystallized granite in a shatter zone that is visible on the eastern side of the mountain. A fine-grained, black igneous rock called diabase intruded into the granite during later volcanic activity. Diabase bodies, or dikes, are visible along the Cadillac Mountain road and on the Schoodic Peninsula.\nDuring the next several hundred million years, the rock layers that still covered the large granite bodies, along with softer rock surrounding the granite, were worn away by erosion.\nGlaciation.\nDuring the last two to three million years, a series of ice sheets flowed and receded across northern North America, eroding mountains and creating U-shaped valleys. The glacier that covered Mount Desert Range, part of which is now called Mount Desert Island, was thick and moved at the rate of a few yards (meters) per year. The mountain range was heavily eroded by the glacier which rounded off mountaintops, carved saddles, deepened valleys, and created the fjard known as Somes Sound, nearly dividing the current island in half. Evidence of the last glacial period, the Wisconsin glaciation from about 75,000 to 11,000 years ago, is visible as long scratches, or striations, and crescent-shaped gouges created by material carried along at the base of the ice. As the climate warmed, the glaciers melted and receded, leaving boulders that had been carried or further south from their original locations. These boulders, or glacial erratics, lie in valleys and on mountaintops, including Bubble Rock on the South Bubble.\nThe coastal areas of Maine sank slightly under the extreme weight of the ice sheets, allowing seawater to cover lowlands thus forming the present-day islands. Evidence of sea caves and past beaches can be found about above current sea level. As the ice receded and the land stabilized, lakes and ponds formed in valleys dammed by glacial debris. Rivers and streams flowed again through the watershed, continuing the gradual erosion of the drainage paths.\nErosion and weathering.\nAcadia has a coastline composed of rocky headlands, and more heavily eroded stony or sandy beaches. Coastal areas directly facing the wind-driven waves of the Atlantic Ocean are solely composed of large boulders as all other material has been washed out to sea. Areas partially protected by rocky headlands contain the remains of more eroded rocks, consisting of pebbles, cobbles and smaller boulders. Sheltered coves, such as at Sand Beach, contain fine-grained particles that are primarily the remains of shells and other hard parts of marine life, including mussels and sea urchins.\nGranitic ridges are subjected to frost weathering. Joints, or fractures, are slowly enlarged as trapped water repeatedly freezes and melts, eventually splitting off a block. Bright pink scars with granitic rubble below are evidence of such weathering; one example can be seen above the Tarn, a pond just south of Bar Harbor.\nAt least twelve sea caves are located in several coastal areas of the park. Sea caves are formed when waves cause erosion of coastal rock formations. If a sea cave is enlarged enough, it may break through a headland to form a sea arch.\nMass wasting and slope failure.\nFrequent thawing in winter prevents large accumulations of snow, and keeps the ground well saturated. Ice storms are common in winter and early spring, while rain occurs throughout the year. Saturated soils, thawing, and heavy precipitation lead to rockfalls every spring along Mount Desert Island's loop road, as well as slumping along coastal bluffs.\nMass wasting (slope movement) of marine clay, deposited when the sea level was much higher, occurs along Hunters Brook on Mount Desert Island. Slumping of the greenish-gray clay destabilized the bank, changing the course of the stream. The eastern end of Otter Cove's beach contains eroded gullies of marine clay. Mass wasting and slope failure may occur wherever marine clay is exposed.\nSeismic activity.\nEarthquakes with epicenters near the park have caused landslides, damaging roads and trails. Earthquakes in Maine occur at a low but steady rate, with magnitudes usually less than 4.8 on the Richter scale.\nPaleontology.\nThe Presumpscot Formation has yielded a diverse collection of mostly marine fossils. The formation is composed of silt and clay deposited between 15 and 11,000 years ago when isostatic loading raised sea level as land was submerged to about above the current level. Post-glacial rebound lowered sea level, exposing the seabed to a depth of about below the current level. A global rise in sea-level flooded the shelf to the current level.\nPlant fossils include pollen, spores, logs, and other plant macrofossils. Invertebrate fossils include foraminifera (protists that form test shells), sponge spicules, bryozoans, bivalves, gastropods, \"Spirorbis\", beetles, ants, barnacles, decapod crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, etc.), ostracodes (seed shrimp), and ophiuroids (brittle stars). Vertebrate fossils include fish and a few rare large mammals, such as walruses, whales, and a mammoth. Walrus remains have been reported on Andrews Island, west of Isle au Haut; Addison Point, northeast of the Schoodic Peninsula; and Gardiner, west-northwest of Isle au Haut. The mammoth bones were found at Scarborough, southwest of Isle au Haut.\nEcology.\nThe ecological zones at Acadia National Park, from highest to lowest elevation, include: nearly barren mountain summits; northern boreal and eastern deciduous forests on the mountainsides; freshwater lakes and ponds, as well as wetlands like marshes and swamps in the valleys between mountains; and the Atlantic shoreline with rocky and sandy beaches, intertidal and subtidal zones.\nTiny subalpine plants grow in the granite joints on mountaintops and on the downwind side of rocks. Stunted, gnarled trees also survive near the summits. Spruce-fir boreal forests cover much of the park. Stands of oak, maple, beech, and other hardwoods more typical of New England represent the eastern deciduous forest. Pitch pines and scrub oaks inhabit isolated forests at their northeastern range limit, while jack pines reach the southern limit of their range in Acadia.\nFourteen great ponds and ten smaller ponds provide habitat for many fish and waterfowl species. More than 20% of the park is classified as wetland. Marshes and swamps form the transition between terrestrial and aquatic environments, maintaining biodiversity by providing a habitat for a wide range of species. Native wildlife frequent wetlands alongside species that are nesting, overwintering or migrating, such as birds along the Atlantic Flyway. Wetlands are composed of 37.5% marine (sea water), 31.6% palustrine (stagnant water), 20% estuarine (coastal, brackish water), 10.7% lacustrine (freshwater lakes and ponds), and 0.2% riverine (flowing streams). Approximately of perennial streams and of intermittent streams flow through the park, while about of shoreline surround 110 lakes and ponds encompassing .\nIntertidal flora and fauna inhabit more than of rocky coastline. The nutrient-rich marine waters cover the intertidal plants and animals twice a day. Pools of calm water form among the rocks around low tides, inhabited by starfish, dog whelks, blue mussels, sea cucumbers, and rockweed.\nFlora.\nFlora common to both deciduous and coniferous woodlands include lowbush blueberry, Canadian bunchberry, hobblebush, bluebead lily, Canada mayflower, wild sarsaparilla, shadbush, starflower, rosy twisted stalk, wintergreen, and white pine trees.\nConiferous forest trees include the balsam fir, eastern hemlock, red pine, red spruce, and white spruce. The park has a potential natural vegetation of northeastern spruce/fir within temperate coniferous forests, according to the original A. W. Kuchler types. Spruce-fir forests cover more than sixty percent of the naturally vegetated habitats in the park. Other coniferous forest plants include dewdrop, mountain holly, pinesap, one-flowered pyrola, shinleaf, trailing arbutus, northern woodsorrel, and drooping woodreed.\nAn invasive insect known as the red pine scale was confirmed on dying red pines on the south side of Norumbega Mountain near Lower Hadlock Pond in 2014.\nDeciduous forest trees include the white ash, big-toothed and trembling aspen, American beech, paper and yellow birch, red oak, American mountain ash, as well as mountain, red, striped, and sugar maples. Other deciduous forest plants include large-leaved aster, chokecherry, red-berried elder, Christmas fern, threeleaf goldthread, early saxifrage, false Solomon's seal, small Solomon's seal, and twinflower.\nTrees commonly found in the mountains and dry, rocky places of the national park include gray birch, common juniper, jack pine, and pitch pine, while smaller trees, or shrub, species include green alder and pin cherry. Other common shrubs and flowering plants found in the mountains and rocky areas include alpine aster, bearberry, velvetleaf blueberry, bush-honeysuckle, black chokeberry, three-toothed cinquefoil, mountain cranberry, bracken fern, Rand's goldenrod, harebell, golden heather, mountain holly, black huckleberry, creeping juniper, sheep laurel, red raspberry, Virginia rose, mountain sandwort, bristly sarsaparilla, sweetfern, and wild raisin. Poverty oatgrass is the most common grass found in mountainous terrain.\nBog plants include bog aster, bog rosemary, cottongrass, large cranberry, small cranberry, bog goldenrod, dwarf huckleberry, blue flag, Labrador-tea, bog laurel, leatherleaf, pitcher plant, rhodora, bristly rose, creeping snowberry, round-leaved sundew, spatulate-leaved sundew, and sweetgale, along with larch and black spruce trees.\nMeadow and roadside plants include speckled alder, flat-topped white aster, New York aster, blue-eyed-grass, azure bluet, spreading dogbane, fireweed, gray goldenrod, rough-stemmed goldenrod, wavy hair-grass, hardhack, whorled loosestrife, tall meadow-rue, meadowsweet, common milkweed, pearly everlasting, wild strawberry, and yellow rattle.\nFreshwater marsh and pond plants include common arrowhead, horned bladderwort, highbush blueberry, bluejoint, common cattail, water lobelia, pickerelweed, marsh St. John's wort, swamp candles, swamp rose, white turtlehead, fragrant water-lily, and yellow water-lily.\nThe Mount Desert Island section of the park harbors more than half of the vascular plant species occurring in Maine. Plant, algal, and fungal specimens collected during research activities at the park are deposited for future study at a herbarium jointly administered by the park and the College of the Atlantic. A special garden called \"The Wild Gardens of Acadia\" was established in the Sieur de Monts area of the park in 1961 and has since grown to include more than 400 indigenous plant species found throughout all park areas.\nFauna.\nThe park's wide variety of natural habitats provides homes for many different animal species. The coastal location also encourages a large number of species; however, the small size and isolation of these habitats from mainland habitats limits the types of animals, especially their size. Smaller animals are better adapted to smaller habitats which makes them more common and easily observed than larger ones such as black bears and moose.\nThe park is inhabited by 37 mammalian species:\nand a solitary native hare species, the snowshoe hare.\nSeven reptilian species live in the park including five snakes (milk, smooth green, redbelly, eastern garter, and the ring-necked snake) and two turtles (the common snapping turtle and the eastern painted turtle).\nEleven amphibian species inhabit the park including the American toad, five frog species (bullfrog, spring peeper, green, pickerel, and wood frog), four salamander species (spotted, dusky, northern two-lined, and four-toed salamander), and the eastern newt.\nThe most abundant fish are the American eel, golden shiner, banded killifish, and pumpkinseed, while commonly found fish include alewife, white sucker, northern redbelly dace, chain pickerel (non-native), three-spined stickleback, nine-spined stickleback, rainbow smelt, and brook trout. Thirteen other fish species (ten non-native) are listed by the NPS as uncommon, while eight other species are listed with an unknown abundance.\nMany marine species may be observed in the surrounding waters, including seals and whales, from a sea kayak or other personal watercraft, or on ranger-narrated boat cruises. Special whale-watching excursions launch from Bar Harbor.\nA total of 215 bird species, including migratory birds, are present at some time during the year. An additional 116 species are possibly present but unconfirmed, making a total of 331 potential species. Thirty-three other bird species are considered historical and no longer present in the park. Large birds include golden and bald eagles, gyrfalcons, turkey vultures, ospreys, cormorants, and various herons, hawks, and owls. Waterfowl species include four geese (Canada, brant, snow, and greater white-fronted geese), along with various ducks including mallards, wood ducks, pintails, wigeons, blue-winged and green-winged teals, canvasbacks, buffleheads, eiders, goldeneyes, and harlequin ducks. Seabirds include terns and four gull species (herring, laughing, ring-billed, and great black-backed gulls), while shorebirds include avocets, sandpipers and plovers. Songbirds are represented by various species of blackbirds, chickadees, finches, jays, sparrows, swallows, thrushes, vireos, warblers, and wrens.\nOne of the more unique songbirds is the red crossbill, a finch that uses its crossed mandibles to efficiently extract the seeds from conifer cones, especially those of spruces, hemlocks, and pines. The crossbills feed their young with the same seeds, rather than the insects which other species feed to their chicks. Any given subspecies of the crossbill (as many as ten are known in North America) will have the same bill size, utilize the same calls to communicate, and prefer certain cones, with smaller-billed birds preferring the smaller cones of hemlocks and larger-billed birds preferring the larger cones of white pines.\nIn 1991, peregrine falcons had a successful nesting in Acadia for the first time since 1956. At least one pair and as many as four pairs have produced offspring over the years since 1991, totaling more than 160 chicks. Many of those chicks were banded to learn about migration, habitat use, and longevity. Banded falcons have been observed as far away as Vermont, Maryland, Washington, D.C., and New Brunswick. Beginning in early spring and continuing into mid-summer, certain trails may be closed to avoid disturbance to falcon nesting areas. The Jordan Cliffs Trail, Valley Cove Trail, Precipice Trail, and a portion of the Orange and Black Path were closed from April 13 to July 13, 2018. The same trails were closed from March 22 to August 3, 2017.\nRecreation.\nMotor vehicle touring along the Park Loop Road begins on April 15, if weather permits, and ends on December 1, unless significant snowfall closes it sooner. A stretch of the Ocean Drive portion of the loop, from Schooner Head Road to Sand Beach and Otter Cliff, is plowed and open all year, as is Jordan Pond Road.\nThe coastline can be explored on guided boat trips or by sea kayak. Canoeing and kayaking are popular activities on accessible lakes and ponds. About of hiking trails traverse forests and mountains, while of carriage roads can be hiked or bicycled (motorized vehicles, including electric bikes, are prohibited). Both the 3.5-mile long Dorr Mountain Trail and the long Sargent Mountain Trail are listed as National Recreation Trails. Horseback riding is permitted on carriage roads and certain other park areas. Climbing is popular at high Otter Cliff, and at Great Head, Precipice, and South Bubble. Sand Beach offers seawater swimming and Echo Lake Beach offers freshwater swimming. In summer, ocean water temperature ranges from while lake and pond temperatures range from .\nRanger-led programs from mid-May to mid-October introduce visitors to the park's diverse natural and cultural history. Park rangers offer short walks, longer hikes, boat cruises, evening amphitheater programs, and children's programs, as well as viewing of peregrine falcons and raptors.\nWinter activities include hiking on trails using snowshoes, or traction footwear, and trekking poles, cross-country skiing on carriage roads, snowmobiling on the paved loop road, and ice fishing on frozen ponds and lakes.\nMount Desert Island has two NPS campgrounds, constructed mainly by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s along with various park trails. Blackwoods Campground is located on the east side of the island, closer to the most popular sites, the carriage roads, and Bar Harbor. Seawall Campground is on the less crowded west side of the island. Schoodic Woods on the Schoodic Peninsula is the newest NPS campground, opened in 2015. Five lean-to shelters are available by advance reservation at Duck Harbor Campground on Isle au Haut. Blackwoods is open throughout the year, though only primitive walk-in camping by permit is possible in winter (December\u2013March), while the others are open from late spring (mid-to-late May) to early autumn (late September to mid-October). Mount Desert Island also has eleven private campgrounds outside park boundaries, while two private campgrounds are on the Schoodic Peninsula, and one is on Isle au Haut.\nThe park hosts the annual Acadia Night Sky Festival, attracting speakers, researchers, photographers, and artists to the area.\nCurrent issues and challenges.\nCongestion.\nPark attendance increased to 3.53 million in 2018, setting a new record for the second year in a row. The seasonal nature of the park means a concentration of visitors in the summer months that is beyond the capacity of park infrastructure. Congestion leads to lack of available parking and gridlock, requiring road closures. Traffic management places a toll on available rangers, competing with rescue operations that also see a sharp increase on peak attendance days.\nThe Island Explorer bus system is offered in part to reduce congestion; it has served 7.7 million passengers since it began operations in 1999. A portion of park entrance fees partially funds the service.\nEnvironmental changes.\nSince the park's founding in 1916, climate change has lengthened the growing season by nearly two months. A longer growing season threatens native plants and invites invasive species that thrive in the longer, warmer summer season. An expanded warm season also lengthens the tourism season, placing further strain on park resources. Changes in rainfall patterns have also taxed park infrastructure, increasing the maintenance required to control erosion and protect the historic carriage roads.\nDeferred maintenance.\nPark officials estimated the cost of needed infrastructure maintenance to be $65.8 million in 2019, a $6 million increase from 2018. The National Park Service has an estimated $11 billion in total deferred maintenance across all units, a number which continues to increase. The backlog compounds existing problems in environmental management and traffic congestion, as infrastructure to manage traffic flow cannot be built until existing infrastructure is properly maintained. Trail and wilderness restoration is also deferred due to insufficient funding. Additionally, the large number of park entrances creates issues with fee compliance, costing additional lost revenue.\nFacilities and support.\nVisitor centers.\nSix visitor information centers are located in or near the park, including the main visitor center at Hulls Cove (northwest of Bar Harbor), a nature center at Sieur de Monts (south of Bar Harbor), an information center on Thompson Island (along the roadway to Mount Desert Island), another information center at Village Green in Bar Harbor, a historical museum in Islesford on Little Cranberry Island, and the Rockefeller Welcome Center on the Schoodic Peninsula. The Rockefeller Welcome Center is the only one open throughout the year, though it is closed on winter weekends; the others are all closed in winter.\nSchoodic Education and Research Center.\nAfter the naval base on the Schoodic Peninsula closed in 2002, the National Park Service (NPS) acquired the land and established the Schoodic Education and Research Center (SERC). The SERC campus is managed by the nonprofit Schoodic Institute and the NPS in a public-private partnership as one of 19 NPS research learning centers in the country. The center is dedicated to supporting scientific research in the park, providing professional development for teachers, and educating students.\nFriends of Acadia.\nIn 1986, a group of Acadia-area residents and park volunteers formed the membership-based nonprofit organization Friends of Acadia (FOA) to organize volunteer efforts and private philanthropy for the benefit of Acadia National Park. The group's first major achievement was a $3.4 million endowment, raised between 1991 and 1996, to maintain the park's carriage road system in perpetuity, which leveraged federal funds to fully restore the road system. Subsequent projects and partnerships included Acadia Trails Forever, the first endowed trail system in an American national park with $13 million raised between 1999 and 2001, and the Island Explorer, a free, propane-powered bus system serving the park and local communities since 1999.\nThe Acadia Youth Conservation Corps was established by FOA and endowed by an anonymous donor in 1999 to employ 16 high school students in maintenance of trails and carriage roads in the summer months. FOA also partnered with park administration to establish the Acadia Youth Technology Team in 2011, an initiative involving local teenaged interns and college-age team leaders supplied with professional-quality imaging tools to foster an appreciation of nature and environmental stewardship, especially among younger people. The team has since been renamed the Acadia Digital Media Team.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62676", "revid": "17421013", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62676", "title": "WWE", "text": "American professional wrestling and entertainment company\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) is an American professional wrestling promotion. It is owned and operated by TKO Group Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. A global integrated media and entertainment company, WWE has also branched out into fields outside of wrestling, including film, football, and other business ventures, such as licensing its intellectual property to other companies to produce video games and action figures.\nAs in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE does not promote a legitimate sporting contest but rather entertainment-based performance theater, featuring storyline-driven, scripted, and partially choreographed matches. However, matches often include moves that put performers at risk of serious injury or death if not performed correctly. The pre-determined aspect of professional wrestling (an industry open secret) was publicly acknowledged by WWE in 1989 to avoid regulation by athletic commissions. WWE markets its product as \"sports entertainment\", acknowledging professional wrestling's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.\nThe promotion was founded in 1953 as the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC), a Northeastern territory of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). Due to booking disputes, CWC left the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in April 1963. After rejoining the NWA in 1971, the WWWF was renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979, and left the NWA again in 1983. Following a trademark dispute with the World Wildlife Fund, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in 2002. In 2011, the promotion ceased branding itself as World Wrestling Entertainment and began solely using the initials WWE, although their legal name remained the same.\nWWE is the largest wrestling promotion in the world. Its main roster is divided into two touring brands, Raw and SmackDown. Its developmental brands, NXT and Evolve, are based at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida. The promotion's programming is available in more than one billion homes worldwide in 30 languages and its global headquarters is located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Mexico City, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore, Dubai, and Munich.\nWWE's corporate entity, Titan Sports, Inc., was incorporated on February 21, 1980, by Vince McMahon: Titan acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., the holding company for the wrestling promotion, in 1982. Titan was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. in 1999, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. in 2002. In January 2023, WWE began to explore a sale of the company, amidst an employee misconduct scandal involving McMahon that initially prompted him to step down as chairman and CEO. In September, WWE merged with Zuffa, the parent company of mixed martial arts promotion Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC), to form TKO Group Holdings, a new public company majority-owned by Endeavor Group Holdings, with McMahon as executive chairman: the promotion's legal name was then changed to World Wrestling Entertainment, LLC. In 2024, McMahon departed TKO amid a sex trafficking scandal and was replaced as executive chairman by Ari Emanuel.\nCompany history.\nCapitol Wrestling Corporation (1953\u20131963).\nWWE's origins can be traced back as far as the 1950s when on January 7, 1953, the first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was produced. There is uncertainty as to who the founder of the CWC was. Some sources state that it was Vincent J. McMahon, while other sources cite McMahon's father Jess McMahon as founder of CWC. The CWC later joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and famous New York promoter Toots Mondt soon joined the promotion.\nVincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking power, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated Northeastern United States. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers being booked to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Mondt and McMahon were not only promoters but also acted as his manager and were accused by other NWA promoters of withholding Rogers making defenses in their cities versus only defending in Mondt and McMahon's own cities, thus maintaining a monopoly on the world title. In a now-infamous situation, the NWA sent former five-time world champion and legitimate wrestler Lou Thesz to Toronto to face Rogers on January 24, 1963. Thesz recalls this was not planned and prior to the match remembered telling Buddy \"we can do this the easy way or the hard way.\" Rogers agreed to lose the fall and title in a one fall match versus the traditional two out of three fall matchup that most world title matches were defended. Once word reached back to Mondt and McMahon, at first they simply ignored the title change. From January until April 1963, Rogers was promoted as the NWA World Champion, or simply the World Heavyweight Champion, in their area.\nWorld Wide Wrestling Federation (1963\u20131979).\nHowever, Mondt and McMahon both eventually left the NWA in protest and formed the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) in the process. They brought along with them Willie Gilzenberg, long time boxing and wrestling promoter in New Jersey. In April 1963, the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was created, with the promotion claiming that inaugural champion Rogers had won a tournament in Rio de Janeiro on April 25, 1963, defeating long time Capitol favorite Antonino Rocca in the finals. In reality, Rocca was no longer in the area, as he was working for Jim Crockett Sr. in the Carolinas. Rogers also had already suffered what would later be a career ending heart attack on April 18 in Akron, Ohio, and was in an Ohio hospital during the time the alleged tournament took place. Rogers lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, with the promotion beginning to be built around Sammartino shortly after.\nIn June 1963, Gilzenberg was named the first president of the WWWF. Mondt left the promotion in the late 1960s and although the WWWF had previously withdrawn from the NWA, McMahon quietly re-joined in 1971.\nWorld Wrestling Federation (1979\u20132002).\nPurchase by Titan Sports (1979\u20131984).\nThe WWWF was renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979. In 1980, Vincent J. McMahon's son, Vincent K. McMahon, and his wife Linda established Titan Sports, Inc. in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts, and applied trademarks for the initials \"WWF\". The company was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in the Cape Cod Coliseum offices, then moved to the building on Holly Hill Lane in Greenwich, Connecticut.\nThe younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. The actual date of sale is still unknown but the generally accepted date is June 6, 1982; however, this was likely only the date the deal was struck but not finalized. On WWF television, Capitol Wrestling Corporation maintained copyrights and ownership past the June 1982 date. The World Wrestling Federation was not solely owned by Vincent J. McMahon but also by Gorilla Monsoon, Arnold Skaaland and Phil Zacko. The deal between the two McMahons was a monthly payment basis, in which if a single payment was missed, ownership would revert to the elder McMahon and his business partners. Looking to seal the deal quickly, McMahon took several loans and deals with other promoters and the business partners (including the promise of a job for life) in order to take full ownership by May or June 1983 for an estimated total of roughly $1 million with the three business partners receiving roughly $815,000 among them and Vincent J. McMahon receiving roughly $185,000. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.\nAt the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and former Capitol employee Jim Barnett all withdrew from the organization. McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters. In an interview with \"Sports Illustrated\", McMahon was quoted as saying: \"In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.\"\nGolden Era (1984\u20131993).\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired American Wrestling Association (AWA) talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film \"Rocky III\". McMahon signed Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward Jesse Ventura as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, Junkyard Dog, Paul Orndorff, Greg Valentine, and Ricky Steamboat, joining existing stars such as Jimmy Snuka, Don Muraco, Sgt. Slaughter and Andr\u00e9 the Giant. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, WrestleMania. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running Starrcade a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with MTV to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term \"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\", due to the cross-promotion of popular culture and professional wrestling. It has been acknowledged that Lauper and her then boyfriend and manager Dave Wolff, himself a wrestling fan, were among the most instrumental in helping the WWF connect with the MTV audience, with Wolff being considered as the person who engineered the rock 'n' wrestling connection.\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his babyface hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years after defeating The Iron Sheik at Madison Square Garden on January 23, 1984. This event is often cited as the start of WWF's Golden Era, or \"Hulkamania\". The introduction of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" on NBC in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s when the now-defunct DuMont Television Network broadcast matches of Vincent J. McMahon's Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the WrestleMania III pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173 for the WWF for 29 years until 2016. A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and Andr\u00e9 the Giant took place on \"The Main Event I\" in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.\nIn 1983, Titan moved its offices to Stamford, Connecticut. Subsequently, a new Titan Sports, Inc. (originally WWF, Inc.) was established in Delaware in 1987 and was consolidated with the Massachusetts entity in February 1988.\nNew Generation Era and start of the Monday Night War (1993\u20131997).\nThe WWF was hit with allegations of steroid abuse and distribution in 1992. This was followed by allegations of sexual harassment by WWF employees the following year. McMahon was eventually exonerated, but the allegations brought bad public relations for the WWF, and an overall bad reputation. The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring Bret Hart, Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Razor Ramon and The Undertaker among others in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program \"Monday Night Raw\". WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, \"Monday Nitro\", which aired in the same time slot as \"Raw\". The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing ratings competition (known as the \"Monday Night War\") until mid-1996. At that point, \"Nitro\" began a nearly two-year ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the New World Order (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (the former Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (the former Diesel).\nTowards the end of the New Generation Era, former WCW and ECW talent were being hired by the WWF, including Steve Austin (initially under The Ringmaster persona), Mankind, and Vader. Adopting the Stone Cold persona, Austin slowly increased in popularity despite being initially promoted as a heel. This started with his \"\" speech, shortly after defeating Jake Roberts in the tournament finals at the 1996 King of the Ring pay-per-view. This era also saw the debut of Rocky Maivia, who later adopted the more famous persona of The Rock.\nAttitude Era, purchase of WCW and ECW, and end of the War (1997\u20132002).\nAs the Monday Night War continued between \"Raw Is War\" and WCW's \"Nitro\", the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult-oriented product, known as the Attitude Era. The era was spearheaded by WWF VP Shane McMahon (son of owner Vince McMahon) and head writer Vince Russo.\n1997 ended with McMahon facing real-life controversy following Bret Hart's controversial departure from the company. This was the result of the Montreal Screwjob, which took place at the 1997 Survivor Series. This proved to be one of several factors in the launch of the Attitude Era as well as the creation of McMahon's on-screen character, \"Mr. McMahon\". Following Hart and Shawn Michaels's departures, Austin became the new face of the company.\nIn 1998 and 1999, The Rock began to increase in popularity as a rival to Stone Cold Steve Austin, being dubbed as the \"People's Champion\". On April 29, 1999, the WWF made its return to terrestrial television, airing a special program known as \"SmackDown!\" on the fledgling UPN network, named after one of The Rock's catchphrases, \"Layeth the smack down\". The Thursday night show became a weekly series on August 26, 1999\u00a0\u2013 competing directly with WCW's Thursday night program titled \"Thunder\" on TBS.\nIn the summer of 1999, Titan Sports, Inc. was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. On October 19, 1999, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million. The company was traded on the NYSE under ticker symbol WWF, later changed to WWE.\nBy the fall of 1999, the Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night War into WWF's favor. After Time Warner merged with America Online (AOL), Ted Turner's control over WCW was considerably reduced. The newly merged company lacked interest in professional wrestling as a whole and decided to sell WCW in its entirety. Although Eric Bischoff, whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million. Shortly after WrestleMania X-Seven, the WWF launched the Invasion storyline, integrating the incoming talent roster from WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). With this purchase, WWF now became by far the sole largest wrestling promotion in North America and in the world. The assets of ECW, which had folded after filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2001, were purchased by WWE in 2003.\nIn 2000, the WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, launched the XFL, a new professional football league that debuted in 2001. The league had high ratings for the first few weeks, but initial interest waned and its ratings plunged to dismally low levels (one of its games was the lowest-rated prime-time show in the history of American television). NBC walked out on the venture after only one season, but McMahon intended to continue alone. However, after being unable to reach a deal with UPN, McMahon shut down the XFL. WWE maintained control of the XFL trademark before McMahon reclaimed the XFL brand, this time under a separate shell company from WWE, in 2017 with intent to relaunch the XFL in 2020.\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2002\u2013present).\nRuthless Aggression Era and first brand split (2002\u20132008).\nOn May 6, 2002, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) changed both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) after the company lost a lawsuit initiated by the World Wildlife Fund over the WWF trademark. Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the World Wildlife Fund regarding the \"WWF\" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment. On June 24, 2002 episode of \"Raw\", Vince McMahon officially dubbed this era as the \"Ruthless Aggression\" era.\nIn March 2002, the WWF had decided to create two separate rosters, with each group of wrestlers appearing on one of their main programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\", due to the overabundance of talent leftover from the Invasion storyline and the ensuing absorption of WCW and ECW contracts. This was dubbed as the \"brand extension\". During this time many new and young wrestlers would join the company, many of whom would become household names for the next years to come such as John Cena, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar, and Batista.\nAlso beginning in 2002, a draft lottery was held nearly every year to set the rosters, with the first draft to determine the inaugural split rosters, and subsequent drafts designed to refresh the rosters of each show. WWE expanded the brand split by relaunching ECW as a third brand on May 26, 2006.\nPG Era and brand reunification (2008\u20132014).\nOn July 22, 2008, WWE adapted a more family-friendly format and their programming received a TV-PG rating, starting the PG Era. The final \"ECW\" program aired on February 16, 2010, after which it was replaced with \"NXT\".\nOn April 7, 2011, WWE, via the WWE Corporate website, the company ceased using the full name World Wrestling Entertainment and henceforth referred to itself solely as WWE, making the latter an orphan initialism. This was said to reflect WWE's global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television, live events, and film production. WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of \"Tough Enough\", being a non-scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the WWE Network (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014). However, the legal name of the company remained as World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.\nBeginning with the August 29, 2011 episode, \"Raw\" \u2013 referred to as \"Raw Supershow\" \u2013 featured talent from both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" (the \"Supershow\" epithet would be dropped on July 23, 2012). Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; the \"Supershow\" format would mark the end of the brand split, as all programming and live events (until July 2016) featured the full WWE roster.\nIn 2013, the company built the sports medicine and training facility WWE Performance Center in the east Orange County, Florida in partnership with Full Sail University from Winter Park, Florida. The training facility is targeted at career and athletic development for the company's wrestlers. Full Sail is also home base to WWE's NXT brand, which served as a developmental territory for WWE.\nReality Era, New Era, and second brand split (2014\u20132020).\nOn February 24, 2014, WWE launched WWE Network, an over-the-top streaming service that would feature archive content from WWE and its predecessors, all pay-per-views (which would continue to be sold through television providers as well), and original programming. On the March 24 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H would dub that point in time the beginning of the \"Reality Era\". \nBeginning in 2015, WWE started to push Roman Reigns as the face of the company since having him win the 2015 Royal rumble match, amidst mixed reception. By 2017 Roman Reigns became their highest merchandise seller.\nOn May 25, 2016, WWE relaunched the brand split, billed as the \"New Era\". Subsequently, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" have each featured their unique rosters, announcers, championships and ring sets/ropes. A draft took place to determine which wrestlers would appear on what show. \"SmackDown\" also moved from Thursdays to Tuesday nights, which began on July 19 (the night of the aforementioned draft), and airs live instead of the previous pre-recorded format.\nDue to the return of the brand split, a new World Championship, called the WWE Universal Championship was introduced at the August 21, 2016 SummerSlam event with Finn B\u00e1lor defeating Seth Rollins to become the inaugural WWE Universal Champion.\nOn November 29, 2016, WWE introduced a new program specifically for their cruiserweight division (wrestlers 205 lbs. and under) called \"WWE 205 Live\". The program focuses exclusively on those wrestlers who qualify for the division. The cruiserweights \u2013 who first became a fixture in WWE with the Cruiserweight Classic tournament \u2013 were originally exclusive to the Raw brand before landing their own brand.\nOn December 15, 2016, WWE established a new WWE United Kingdom Championship, with the inaugural champion being decided by a 16-man tournament to air on WWE Network featuring wrestlers from the UK and Ireland during January 2017. WWE executive Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque said the eventual plan with the new title and tournament was to establish a UK-based brand with its own weekly television show. WWE subsequently launched its UK-based brand as an offshoot of NXT, NXT UK, in June 2018, with Johnny Saint serving as inaugural general manager.\nStarting in September 2019, NXT had a weekly, live, two-hour show Wednesday nights on the USA Network and WWE began promoting NXT as their \"third brand\". However, in 2021 NXT was moved to Tuesday nights, having conceded the Wednesday Night Wars to rival promotion All Elite Wrestling (AEW), and in September of that year was reinstated to its original function as the developmental brand for the main roster (Raw and SmackDown), under the name \"NXT 2.0\".\nCOVID-19 pandemic and return to touring (2020\u20132022).\nIn March 2020, WWE began to be impacted by the American onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In mid-March, three of the four major sports leagues closed locker rooms to the media as a precautionary measure. As other sports cancellations and postponements were being introduced, WWE began to film its weekly programs at the Performance Center without spectators and with only essential staff present, beginning with the March 13 episode of \"SmackDown\"\u00a0\u2013 the March 11 episode of \"NXT\" had been recorded at the Performance Center with paying fans, thus being WWE's last event to have ticketed fans in attendance before the pandemic took full effect. WrestleMania 36 was scheduled to take place on April 5 at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa but on March 16, was moved to Orlando to be held behind closed doors. WrestleMania, as well as \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" for a period before and after WrestleMania, shifted from live broadcasts to a pre-recorded format. \"NXT\" continued to air from Full Sail University, but under similar restrictions.\nLive broadcasts returned on April 13, with the existing arrangements continuing; WWE stated to ESPN.com that \"we believe it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times\", and that the company's programming \"bring[s] families together and deliver a sense of hope, determination and perseverance\". It was subsequently reported that Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had deemed WWE a business critical to the state's economy, and had added an exception under the state's stay-at-home order for employees of a \"professional sports and media production\" that is closed to the public and has a national audience. The decision was met with criticism from media outlets, with several media outlets pointing out that DeSantis' actions happened on the same day a pro-Donald Trump political action committee led by Linda McMahon, who was previously a part of Trump's cabinet, pledged to spend $18.5 million in advertising in Florida, and that, also on the same day, Vince McMahon was named part of an advisory group created by Trump to devise a strategy in re-launching the US economy.\nOn April 15, WWE started a series of cuts and layoffs in response to the pandemic, including releasing a number of performers (Karl Anderson, Kurt Angle, Aiden English, EC3, Epico, Luke Gallows, Curt Hawkins, No Way Jose, Sarah Logan, Mike Kanellis, Maria Kanellis, Primo, Erick Rowan, Rusev, Lio Rush, Zack Ryder, Heath Slater, and Eric Young), three producers (Dave Finlay, Shane Helms and Lance Storm), referee Mike Chioda, and multiple NXT/Performance Center trainees and staff. WWE executives also took a pay cut, and the company has also suspended construction on its new headquarters for at least six months. The firings caused significant backlash by fans; with \"Business Insider\" calling them \"livid\". Both fans and several media outlets pointed out that while WWE claimed that these actions were \"necessary due to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic\", the WWE also claimed to have \"substantial financial resources. Available cash and debt capacity currently total approximately $0.5 billion\". DeSantis' claimed WWE was \"essential\", which meant that the company's revenues loss would be limited.\nIn August 2020, WWE relocated from the Performance Center to Orlando's Amway Center for a long-term residency, broadcasting episodes of \"Raw\", \"SmackDown\", and pay-per-views through a virtual fan viewing experience called WWE ThunderDome. Inside the ThunderDome, drones, lasers, pyro, smoke, and projections were utilized to enhance the wrestlers' entrances on a level similar to that of pay-per-view productions pre-pandemic. Nearly 1,000 LED boards were installed to allow for rows and rows of virtual fans. It was free of charge for fans to virtually attend the events, though they had to reserve their virtual seat ahead of time. During this time, Roman Reigns began his historic world title reign with the WWE Universal Championship, which would eventually surpass 1,000 days; being the longest world title reign in the WWE since Hulk Hogan from 1984 to 1988. WWE remained at the Amway Center up through early December before relocating the ThunderDome to Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. The ThunderDome relocated to Yuengling Center, located on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa, beginning with the April 12, 2021, episode of \"Raw\". In October 2020, NXT events were relocated from Full Sail University to the Performance Center in a similar setup dubbed the Capitol Wrestling Center. It had many of the same features as the ThunderDome, but with a small crowd of select live fans included, in addition to the virtual fans. The name is also an homage to WWE's predecessor, the Capitol Wrestling Corporation. On May 21 WWE brought back fans full time, beginning with a 25-city tour, thus ending the ThunderDome residency. The July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\" started WWE's return to the road, taking place at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas.\nIn January 2021, WWE moved WrestleMania 37, which was originally to be held in Inglewood, California on March 28, to Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida\u00a0\u2013 WrestleMania 36's original location\u00a0\u2013 as a two-night event on April 10 and 11, with fans in attendance, though to a limited capacity. This marked WWE's first event during the pandemic to have ticketed fans in attendance with a maximum of 25,000 spectators for each night with COVID-19 protocols in place. Also around this time, the WWE Network in the United States became exclusively distributed by Peacock on March 18, 2021 (ahead of Fastlane and WrestleMania 37). The merger of the WWE Network and Peacock did not affect the service outside of the United States. The move to Peacock received some criticisms from fans particularly due to Peacock's heavy censorship policy, the company began the removal of some of the contents that were considered iconic moments of the Attitude Era that were deemed inappropriate by Peacock, these archived contents would no longer be available under any of WWE's authorized platforms. Amdist the criticisms, in April 2021 WWE executive Triple H defended WWE's move to Peacock.\nNXT was moved to a Tuesday night timeslot in 2021 and was rebooted as NXT 2.0 later that year, reinstituting its original function as a developmental brand. The Performance Center became NXT's permanent home base, replacing Full Sail. Maximum capacity crowds resumed and the Capitol Wrestling Center name was phased out. In February 2022, the 205 Live brand was dissolved and the \"205 Live\" show was replaced by a new NXT show called \"Level Up\".\nOn February 24, 2022, WWE launched a partnership with On Location, a company known for providing premium hospitality experiences for marquee events. Through the partnership, spectators will have access to hospitality packages for WWE's five biggest events, including WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Royal Rumble, Survivor Series, and Money in the Bank. The 2022 Money in the Bank was WWE's first event to offer the premium hospitality packages. These ticket and travel packages include premier seating, premium hospitality offerings, and meet-and-greets with current WWE wrestlers and legends.\nChanges in leadership (2022\u20132023).\nOn June 17, 2022, amidst an investigation by WWE's Board of Directors into reported \"hush money\" paid to a former employee by Vince McMahon following an affair, Mr. McMahon stepped down as chairman and CEO of WWE and was replaced by his daughter, Stephanie McMahon, as the interim chairwoman of WWE. Despite the change Vince McMahon came out on \"WWE SmackDown\", that night opening the show with a brief speech, the highlights of which \"then, now, forever and most importantly together\" was quoted by various news media as Vince letting people know that he was still in creative control from behind the scenes. On July 22, 2022, Vince McMahon officially retired, stating on Twitter, \"At 77, time for me to retire. Thank you, WWE Universe. Then. Now. Forever. Together.\" Following Vince's retirement, Stephanie McMahon was officially named chairwoman while she and Nick Khan were named co-CEOs of WWE. Triple H would take over as head of creative, while resuming his position as Executive Vice President of Talent Relations and later being promoted to Chief Content Officer. Commentators have highlighted the significance of McMahon's retirement, saying that it marked the historic start of a new period in WWE's history. The 2022 SummerSlam event held on July 30, 2022, was the first WWE pay-per-view event to be held under the leadership of Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.\nOn August 18, 2022; WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels was promoted to WWE Vice President of Talent Development Creative. On September 6, 2022, WWE announced Paul 'Triple H' Levesque's promotion to Chief Content Officer. On January 6, 2023, Vince McMahon announced intentions to return to the company ahead of media rights negotiations. WWE's media rights with Fox and USA Network are set to expire in 2024. That same month, JP Morgan were hired to handle a possible sale of the company, with companies such as Comcast (owners of NBCUniversal and long-time partners of WWE), Fox Corp (broadcaster of \"SmackDown\"), Disney (owners of ESPN), Warner Bros. Discovery (broadcasters of rival promotion AEW), Netflix, Amazon, Endeavor Group Holdings (owners of UFC), and Liberty Media being in the speculation for buying the company with CAA and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund also on the list. On January 10, 2023, Stephanie McMahon resigned as chairwoman and co-CEO. On the same day Vince McMahon assumed the role of executive Chairman of the WWE while Nick Khan became the sole CEO of the WWE.\nAcquisition of WWE by Endeavor (2023).\nOn April 3, 2023; WWE and Endeavor reached a deal under which WWE would merge with UFC's parent company Endeavor to form a new company, which would go public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \"TKO\". Endeavor would hold a 51% stake in \"TKO\", with WWE's shareholders having a 49% stake, valuing WWE at $9.1 billion. This marked the first time that WWE has not been majority-controlled by the McMahon family. Vince McMahon was appointed to serve as executive chairman of the new entity, Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel would become CEO, with Mark Shapiro becoming president and chief operating officer. Emanuel would not take on any creative roles with WWE's head of creative Paul Levesque appointed to remain in his role, and with Nick Khan becoming president of WWE post-merger (not unlike Dana White's role as president of UFC). The deal additionally granted McMahon life tenure as executive chairman, the right to nominate five WWE representatives on the 11 member board, as well as veto rights over certain actions by the new company. In addition, McMahon would own 34% of the new company, with a 16% voting interest.\nEmanuel stated that this merger would \"bring together two leading pureplay sports and entertainment companies\" and provide \"significant operating synergies\". Vince McMahon stated that \"family businesses have to evolve for all the right reasons\", and that \"given the incredible work that Ari and Endeavor have done to grow the UFC brand \u2014 nearly doubling its revenue over the past seven years \u2014 and the immense success we've already had in partnering with their team on a number of ventures, I believe that this is without a doubt the best outcome for our shareholders and other stakeholders.\"\nMerger with UFC and the formation of TKO Group Holdings (2023\u2013present).\nThe merger between WWE and UFC into TKO Group Holdings (TKO) was completed on September 12, 2023. Although the company's legal name remained World Wrestling Entertainment, LLC, it remained united with UFC as part of the new entity \"TKO\". As part of the deal WWE and UFC remained separate divisions of the new entity featuring Professional Wrestling and Mixed martial arts respectively. The first WWE show under the Endeavor regime was the September 12, 2023, episode of NXT which opened with Ilja Dragunov defeating Wes Lee in a singles match, and in the main event Becky Lynch defeated Tiffany Stratton to win the NXT Women's Championship. The first WWE pay per view under TKO was NXT No Mercy on September 30, 2023. Popular wrestler CM Punk returned to WWE in late 2023 and in his first match upon return he defeated Dominik Mysterio at WWE MSG Show on December 26, 2023.\nOn January 23, 2024 Dwayne Johnson, also known as \"The Rock\" joined the TKO Group Holdings board of directors. Three days later on January 26 Vince McMahon once again resigned due to further sexual misconduct allegations, with Ari Emanuel obtaining greater control as the new Chairman of TKO.\nOn April 1, 2024, Triple H stated that WWE had entered \"another era\". The next day, before WrestleMania XL, TKO's parent company, Endeavor was taken private by its largest investor, Silver Lake, a year after Endeavor's three-year run as a public company where Endeavor purchased WWE a year prior. On April 3, WWE wrestler Cody Rhodes coined the term \"Renaissance Era\" for the period. At WrestleMania XL, the WWE would officially debut a new signature intro ahead of the event's first match. Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque would introduce the fans in attendance, \"Welcome to a new time, welcome to a new era,\" and at the WrestleMania's second night Stephanie McMahon would reiterate this, referring to it as the \"Paul Levesque era\". On April 7, in the main event of the second and final night of the event, Cody Rhodes defeated Roman Reigns to win the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.\nOn January 23, 2024, WWE announced an agreement with Netflix, which would include \"Raw\" moving from USA Network to the platform worldwide, and Netflix acquire the rights to all of WWE's weekly programs, live events, and library content outside of the United States. On May 4, 2024, WWE held Backlash France, their first ever pay-per-view event in France. On October 29, WWE announced WWE ID, a new talent development system incorporating partnerships with independent promotions and wrestling schools.\nIn 2024, WWE began a wider talent exchange between Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and its NXT brand. A multi-year partnership was officially announced on January 16, 2025. WWE also formed partnerships with Pro Wrestling Noah and Dream Star Fighting Marigold. On April 19, 2025, during the WrestleMania 41 pre-show, WWE announced its intent to acquire the Mexican promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide in conjunction with Fillip, a Mexican sports and entertainment company. The sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2025.\nContracts.\nWWE signs most of its talent to exclusive contracts, meaning talent can appear or perform only on WWE programming and events. They are not permitted to appear or perform for another promotion unless special arrangements are made beforehand. WWE keeps all wrestlers' salary, employment length, benefits, and all other contract details strictly private.\nWWE classifies its professional wrestlers as independent contractors and not as employees. A study by the \"University of Louisville Law Review\" found that after applying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 20-factor test, 16 factors \"clearly indicate that wrestlers are employees\". However, as a result of WWE terming them as independent contractors, \"the wrestlers are denied countless benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled\".\nIn December 2021, WWE revealed a new recruitment contract for athletes who are currently attending college. The NCAA-approved name, image, and likeness contracts are referred to by WWE as \"next in line agreements\".\nStock and corporate governance.\nOn October 19, 1999, WWF, which had been owned previously by parent company Titan Sports, launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million. The company traded on the NYSE under ticker symbol WWE.\nThe company has actively marketed itself as a publicly traded company through presentations at investor conferences and other investor relations initiatives. In June 2003, the company began paying a dividend on its shares of $0.04 per share. In June 2011, the company cut its dividend from $0.36 to $0.12. In 2014, concerns about the company's viability caused wide fluctuations in its share price.\nIn September 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings, UFC and WWE formed a new publicly traded company, TKO Group Holdings, Inc. The new entity went public on September 12, 2023, and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol \"TKO\".\nAt the close of the deal, Endeavor held a 51% stake in TKO Group Holdings, with WWE's shareholders having a 49% stake, valuing WWE at $9.1 billion. This marked the first time that WWE had not been majority-controlled by members of the McMahon family. Endeavor CEO Ari Emanuel became CEO of TKO and Mark Shapiro became president and chief operating officer, with each maintaining their respective roles at Endeavor. UFC and WWE continued to operate as separate divisions under TKO, with Dana White as CEO of the UFC and Nick Khan serving as president of WWE post-merger. WWE's head of creative Paul Levesque remained in his role.\nWWE Network and distribution deals.\nOn February 24, 2014, WWE launched WWE Network, an over-the-top subscription streaming service The service, which was initially proposed as a linear pay television service, carries all WWE pay-per-view events, original programming (including in-ring programs, as well as documentary and reality programming highlighting the promotion and its history), and access to WWE library content such as classic pay-per-views and television episodes from WWE and other promotions that it had acquired. The service reached 1,000,000 subscribers on January 27, 2015, in less than one year of its launch, with WWE claiming that it was thus \"the fastest-growing digital subscription service ever\".\nIn May 2014, WWE and NBCUniversal agreed to a new contract that would see both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" continue on NBC owned networks the USA Network and Syfy.

The apparel, for men and women, was first released in spring of 2016. WWE markets the brand through various products, including beverages, supplements, and gyms. WWE will hold a 50% stake in the brand, and so will advertise it regularly across all its platforms, hoping to give it one billion impressions a month, and take some of the fitness market from Under Armour. WWE wrestlers and staff have been shown wearing various Tapout gear since the venture began.\nPartnerships.\nThough an infrequent occurrence, during its history WWE has worked with other wrestling promotions in collaborative efforts.\nDuring the 1970s to early 1990s, WWF had working relationships with the Japanese New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF), Universal Lucha Libre (FULL), and the Mexican Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). These working relationships led to the creations of the WWF World Martial Arts, Light Heavyweight and Intercontinental Tag Team championships.\nDuring the period of 1992\u20131996, WWF had talent exchange agreements with the United States and Japanese independent companies Smokey Mountain Wrestling (SMW), Super World of Sports (SWS), WAR, and the United States Wrestling Association (USWA).\nIn 1997, the company did business with Mexico's AAA promotion, bringing in a number of AAA wrestlers for the Royal Rumble event and namesake match.\nIn 1997, WWF would also do business with Japan's Michinoku Pro Wrestling (MPW), bringing in MPW talent to compete in the company's light heavyweight division and in their 1997 Light Heavyweight Championship tournament.\nFrom 1997 to 1998, WWF partnered with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), with WWF hosting NWA matches on its programming.

In 2017, Progress talent would participate in the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament and at WWE's WrestleMania Axxess events. Three years later in 2020, Progress programming began airing on the WWE Network. Their partnership ended in January 2023 as both companies pursued different digital media strategies. Progress has since focused on its own streaming platform, DEMAND PROGRESS, and other distribution options.\nIn 2017, WWE partnered with Scotland's Insane Championship Wrestling (ICW) with some ICW talent appearing in the WWE United Kingdom Championship Tournament and at WWE's WrestleMania Axxess events. In 2017, WWE explored a deal to bring ICW programming onto the WWE Network \u2013 ICW programming began airing on the WWE Network in 2020. This partnership ended in January 2023 as both companies pursued different digital media strategies.\nIn 2018, WWE partnered with Germany's Westside Xtreme Wrestling (wXw). In October 2018, WWE hosted German tryouts at the wXw Wrestling Academy. In 2020, wXw programming began airing on the WWE Network. Their partnership ended in May 2024 when their deal expired.\nIn February 2023, WWE (specifically their NXT brand) launched a partnership with the Texas-based independent promotion Reality of Wrestling (ROW), which is owned by WWE Hall of Famer and NXT commentator Booker T.\nIn December 2023, WWE launched a partnership with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). In early 2024, WWE expanded their partnership with AJPW, with NXT wrestler Charlie Dempsey going to Japan to challenge for AJPW's Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship which marked the first match under the new collaboration. The partnership ended in late 2024 due to an exclusive deal between CyberAgent and WWE, which affected AJPW's ability to work with WWE.\nThroughout 2024, WWE launched partnerships with Dream Star Fighting Marigold (Marigold), Pro Wrestling Noah (NOAH), and Game Changer Wrestling (GCW).\nIn October 2024, WWE launched the WWE ID system to develop and support the training of independent wrestlers, with the first WWE ID partner wrestling schools and promotions being Black and Brave Academy, Nightmare Factory, Elite Pro Wrestling Training Center, and KnokX Pro Academy, among others.\nIn January 2025, WWE announced a multi-year partnership with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) that allows TNA wrestlers and NXT wrestlers to appear on NXT events, \"TNA Impact!\", and select WWE and TNA Premium Live Events.\nThroughout the company's history, WWE has had past arrangements with independent companies from the contiguous United States (such as Ohio Valley Wrestling) and Puerto Rico (such as the International Wrestling Association) with the companies serving as developmental territories.\nDrug testing and wellness program.\nThe World Wrestling Federation had a drug-testing policy in place as early as 1987, initially run by an in-house administrator. In 1991, wrestlers were subjected to independent testing for anabolic steroids for the first time. The independent testing ceased in 1996, being deemed too expensive as the company was going through financial duress at the time as a result of their competitors, World Championship Wrestling, being so overwhelmingly more popular and hurting the federation's business.\nThe Talent Wellness Program is a comprehensive drug, alcohol, and cardiac screening program initiated in February 2006, three months after the sudden death of one of their highest-profile and most popular talents, Eddie Guerrero, who died at 38-years-old. The policy tests for recreational drug use and abuse of prescription medication, including anabolic steroids. Under the guidelines of the policy, talent is also tested annually for pre-existing or developing cardiac issues. The drug testing is handled by Aegis Sciences Corporation; the cardiac evaluations are handled by New York Cardiology Associates P.C. The Wellness Policy requires that all talent \"under contract to WWE who regularly perform in-ring services as a professional sports entertainer\" undergo testing; however, part-time competitors are exempt from testing.\nAfter the double-murder and suicide committed by one of its performers, Chris Benoit, with a possible link to steroid abuse encouraged by WWE, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested that WWE turn over any material regarding its talent wellness policy.\nIn August 2007, WWE and its contracted performers defended the program in the wake of several busts of illegal pharmacy that linked WWE performers to steroid purchases even after the policy was put into place. Ten professional wrestlers were suspended for violating the Wellness Policy after reports emerged they were all customers of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. According to a statement attributed to WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, an eleventh wrestler was later added to the suspension list.\nOn September 13, 2010, WWE updated their list of banned substances to include muscle relaxers.\nLegal disputes and controversies.\n1990s drug scandal.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, George Zahorian was thought to have routinely distributed steroids and other drugs to WWF wrestlers, supposedly with the approval of WWF owner Vince McMahon. In 1993, McMahon was indicted in federal court after the steroid controversy engulfed the promotion, forcing him to temporarily cede control of the WWF to his wife Linda. The case went to trial in 1994, where McMahon himself was accused of distributing steroids to his wrestlers. One notable prosecution witness was Nailz (real name: Kevin Wacholz), a former WWF performer who had been fired after a violent confrontation with McMahon. Nailz testified that McMahon had ordered him to use steroids, but his credibility was called into question during his testimony as he repeatedly stated that he \"hated\" McMahon. The jury would later acquit McMahon of the charges and he resumed his role in the day-to day operations of the WWF.\n1990s ring boy scandal.\nDuring the early 1990s, Mel Phillips, WWF's ring announcer and ring crew head, was accused of molesting multiple \"ring boys\", under-aged children that worked as part of the WWF ring crew. In 1992, Phillips was fired from the WWF. Phillips had previously been temporarily dismissed from the WWF in 1988 for sexual misconduct, but was brought back that same year.\nOn October 29, 2020, it was reported by \"Business Insider\" that Vince McMahon and his wife Linda were aware of the allegations against Phillips but willfully turned a blind eye to them. According to Freedom of Information Act requests for court records regarding the ring boy scandal, Vince, under oath, stated that he was aware that Phillips had taken a \"peculiar and unnatural interest in children\" but refused to take action against him. Further testimony revealed that Vince, after bringing Phillips back to the WWF in 1988, had made Phillips promise to \"stop chasing after kids\". It was also reported by \"Business Insider\" that, under Vince and Linda McMahon's directive, the WWF began a campaign to discredit Tom Cole, one of the children who had accused Phillips of sexual misconduct, and Cole's family. In response to the \"Business Insider\" report, Jerry McDevitt, WWE's attorney, stated that the accusations against Phillips were related to his unusual \"foot fetish\" but did not include \"anything approximating conventional forms of sexual abuse such as rape, sodomy, etc.\" He additionally described the claims that the McMahons knew about the accusations against Phillips but refused to take action and continued to employ him under the condition that he \"stop chasing after kids\" as \"outlandish\" and \"classic libel\".\nTom Cole died in February 2021.\nDisputes with rival companies.\nIn 1996, Titan Sports, the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation, sued World Championship Wrestling (WCW) over WCW implying that Scott Hall and Kevin Nash (Razor Ramon and Diesel) were invading WCW on the WWF's behalf. This led to a series of lawsuits filed by both companies as the Monday Night War heated up. The lawsuit went on for years, ending with a settlement in 2000. One of the terms gave then WWF the right to bid on WCW's assets if the company were liquidated. AOL Time Warner, the then-parent company of WCW, canceled WCW's television shows in March 2001 and sold the company assets to the WWF.\nOn May 23, 2012, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) sued former employee Brian Wittenstein and WWE. The suit alleged that Wittenstein violated a non-disclosure agreement and shared confidential information with the WWE which represented a comparative advantage in negotiating with wrestling talent under contract with TNA. He was subsequently hired by WWE, after which TNA asserted that Wittenstein violated the agreement by downloading confidential TNA trade secrets and providing that information to WWE. Although WWE fired Wittenstein and alerted TNA officials as to the disclosure of the information, TNA claimed that WWE had access to the information for three weeks prior to disclosure and in this time, the WWE used secret contract information and attempted to poach their talent in violation of Tennessee's Uniform Trade Secrets Act. The lawsuit was formally withdrawn without prejudice, by the plaintiff, TNA, on January 15, 2013, under a \"Notice of Voluntary Nonsuit\" which offers no ruling on the merits of the suit and allows TNA to potentially refile at a later date.\nOn January 11, 2022, Major League Wrestling (MLW) filed an anti-trust lawsuit against WWE, accusing them of interfering in television and streaming deals and poaching talent. Through the lawsuit, it was disclosed that a streaming deal with Fox Corporation-owned Tubi was terminated due to WWE allegedly threatening to pull their programming from the sibling Fox broadcast network. The suit also alleges that WWE pressured Vice TV to withdraw from negotiations with MLW.\nOwen Hart's death.\nOn May 23, 1999, Owen Hart fell to his death in Kansas City, Missouri, during the Over the Edge pay-per-view event in a stunt that went wrong. WWF broke kayfabe by having television commentator Jim Ross repeatedly tell those watching live on pay-per-view that what had just transpired was not a wrestling angle or storyline and that Hart was hurt badly, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation. While several attempts to revive him were made, he died from his injuries. The cause of death was later revealed to be internal bleeding from blunt force trauma. The WWF management controversially chose to continue the event. Later, Jim Ross revealed Hart's death to the home viewers during the pay-per-view, but not to the crowd in the arena. While the show did go on, it has never been released commercially by WWF Home Video. In 2014, fifteen years after his death, the WWE Network aired the event for the first time. A small photo tribute is shown before the start informing fans that Hart died during the original broadcast. All footage of Hart was edited out of the event. The statement reads: \"In Memory of Owen Hart May 7, 1965 \u2013 May 23, 1999 who accidentally passed away during this broadcast.\" Four weeks after the event, the Hart family sued the WWF over how dangerous and poorly planned the stunt was, and over the harness system being defective. After over a year and a half into the case, a settlement was reached on November 2, 2000, which saw the WWF give the Hart family US$18 million.\nDispute with USA Network.\nIn April 2000, USA Networks, Inc., the parent company of USA Network, had filed a lawsuit against World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. in a bid to keep \"Raw is War\" and all WWF programming after the WWF opened up a bidding war a month prior. Viacom's proposed bid included a $30-million to $50-million equity investment in the company and carriage on broadcast, billboards and radio of both wrestling matches along with the then-launched XFL.\nOn June 27, 2000, the Delaware Supreme Court ruled in favor of the WWF. The next day, Viacom won the rights to all WWF programming for $12.6 million including \"Raw is War\" on TNN/Spike TV, a revamped \"Sunday Night Heat\" on MTV and retained \"SmackDown!\" on UPN after the merger with CBS in 1999. The lawsuit centered on USA's contention that it did not have to match every aspect of a Viacom offer to satisfy a right of first refusal clause in its contract that allowed its deal with the WWF to continue. In 2005, WWE's programming (excluding \"SmackDown!\") moved back to USA Network (now owned by NBCUniversal) and maintains its relationship to this day.\nWWF name dispute.\nIn 1994, Titan Sports had entered into an agreement with the World Wide Fund for Nature (also trademarked WWF), an environmental organization, regarding Titan's use of the \"WWF\" acronym, which both organizations had been using since at least March 1979. Under the agreement, Titan had agreed to cease using the written acronym \"WWF\" in connection with its wrestling promotion, and to minimize (though not eliminate) spoken uses of \"WWF\" on its broadcasts, particularly in scripted comments. In exchange, the environmental group (and its national affiliates) agreed to drop any pending litigation against Titan, and agreed not to challenge Titan's use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" name or the promotion's then-current logo.\nIn 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. in the United Kingdom, alleging various violations of the 1994 agreement. The Court of Appeal agreed that the promotion company had violated the 1994 agreement, particularly in regards to merchandising. The last televised event to market the WWF logo was the UK-based pay-per-view Insurrextion 2002. On May 5, 2002, the company launched its \"Get The F Out\" marketing campaign and changed all references on its website from \"WWF\" to \"WWE\", while switching the URL from \"WWF.com\" to \"WWE.com\". The next day, the official name change from World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., was publicized in a press release and during a broadcast of \"Raw\", from the Hartford Civic Center.\nFollowing the name change, the use of the WWF \"scratch\" logo became prohibited on all WWE properties. Additionally, past references to the \"WWF\" trademark and initials in 'specified circumstances' became censored. Despite the litigation, WWE was still permitted use of the original WWF logo, which was used from 1979 through 1994 and had been explicitly exempted under the 1994 agreement, as well as the similar \"New WWF Generation\" logo, which was used from 1994 through 1998. Furthermore, the company could still make use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" and \"World Wrestling Federation Entertainment\" names without consequence. In 2003, WWE won a limited decision to continue marketing certain classic video games from THQ and Jakks Pacific that contained the WWF \"scratch\" logo. However, the packaging on those games had all WWF references replaced with WWE.\nStarting with the 1,000th episode of \"Raw\" in July 2012, the WWF \"scratch\" logo is no longer censored in archival footage due to WWE reaching a new settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature. In addition, the F in WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage. Since then, full-length matches and other segments featuring the WWF initials and \"scratch\" logo have been added to the WWE website and the WWE Classics on Demand and eventually the WWE Network service. This also includes WWE Home Video releases since October 2012, starting with the re-release of \"Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain\". Although the WWF initials and logo are no longer censored in archival footage, WWE cannot use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising.\nHarry Slash and the Slashtones lawsuit.\nHarry \"Slash\" Grivas and Roderick Kohn filed a lawsuit against WWE in June 2003 due to the music being used for its programming and DVDs without consent or payment. It also asserted a violation of the rights to original music used by ECW that WWE had been using during the Invasion storyline of 2001. The case was resolved on both sides with a settlement that saw WWE purchase the catalog outright in January 2005.\nUltimate Warrior-related disputes.\nIn 1993, Jim Hellwig, known in the WWF as \"The Ultimate Warrior\", legally changed his name to the mononym Warrior. This one-word name appears on all legal documents pertaining to Warrior, and his children carry the Warrior name as their legal surname. Warrior and the WWF engaged in a series of lawsuits and legal actions in 1996 and 1998, where both parties sought a declaration that they owned the characters, Warrior and Ultimate Warrior, under both contract and copyright law. The court ruled that Warrior was legally entitled to use the gimmick, costuming, face paint designs, and mannerisms of the \"Warrior\" character.\nOn September 27, 2005, WWE released a DVD documentary focusing on Warrior's retrospective wrestling career, titled \"The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior\". The DVD featured clips of his more notable feuds and matches along with commentary from WWE stars past and present (most of which are unflattering). The DVD has provoked some controversy due to Warrior's allegations of libel by WWE against him. Originally, Warrior was asked to help with the production of the DVD, but as he refused to work with WWE, there had been some resulting animosity between Warrior and WWE over the Warrior claiming bias on the part of WWE. In January 2006, Warrior filed another lawsuit against WWE in an Arizona court over the depiction of his wrestling career in \"The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior\" DVD. On September 18, 2009, Warrior's lawsuit in Arizona was dismissed.\nWarrior returned to WWE to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. During his induction, he mentioned that WWE should create an award to honor those behind the scenes called the Jimmy Miranda Award, named after a long time WWE employee who died. Warrior died three days after being inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. WWE decided to create the Warrior Award, an award for people \"who embodied the spirit of the Ultimate Warrior.\" The award was later given to Connor Michalek (a child who died from cancer), Joan Lunden (a journalist who was diagnosed with cancer), and Eric LeGrand (a former college football player who became a quadriplegic after an in-game injury). In October 2017, WWE used the tagline \"Unleash Your Warrior\" when promoting Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Since Warrior's death, WWE has been accused of whitewashing and ignoring Warrior's bigoted and controversial past comments. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" described Warrior in real-life having made public \"vile, bigoted, hateful, judgmental comments\", citing as an example that regarding Bobby Heenan's cancer diagnosis, Warrior said, \"Karma is just a beautiful thing to behold.\" \"Vice\" wrote that \"completely whitewashing his past and elevating his likeness to a bland symbol of corporate altruism is shockingly tone-deaf, especially for a company that's at least outwardly trying to appear progressive, inclusive and diverse.\"\nMorals clause violations.\nUnder Section 9.13(a) of WWE's booking contract, commonly known as the \"morals clause\", the company has a zero-tolerance policy involving domestic violence, child abuse and sexual assault. Upon arrest and conviction for such crimes, a WWE talent shall be immediately suspended and their contract terminated.\nConcussion lawsuit.\nStarting in 2014, numerous former WWE talent filed multiple lawsuits against WWE alleging that WWE did not protect and hid information from their talent about concussions and CTE. The former talent claimed physical and mental health issues as a result of physical trauma they experience in WWE. The lawsuits were filed by attorney Konstantine Kyros. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed many of the lawsuits in September 2018. In September 2020, the lawsuits were dismissed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Supreme Court of the United States subsequently declined to hear the case in April 2021.\nRelationship with Saudi Arabia.\nThe events promoted in Saudi Arabia by WWE have been subjected to criticism due to allegations of sportswashing. WWE has been accused of contributing to Saudi Arabia's discrimination of LGBT people and women by holding events in the country.\nWWE's relation with Saudi Arabia has been condemned by activist groups such as Code Pink and several politicians.\nAshley Massaro affidavit.\nPrior to her death on May 15, 2019, former WWE wrestler Ashley Massaro alleged that she was sexually assaulted at a US military base during a 2006 WWE tour of Kuwait by a man posing as a doctor, and that WWE officials persuaded her to not report it to the appropriate authorities as they did not want it to affect the company's relationship with the military. WWE officials would later claim they had no knowledge of Massaro's alleged sexual assault.\nAfter her death, an affidavit by Massaro describing the sexual assault allegations in detail was subsequently released by the law firm that represented her. In response, WWE said that their executives had not been previously informed of the allegations described in the affidavit. Despite previous denials from WWE about having knowledge of her allegation, in February 2024 an attorney representing former WWE Head of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis stated that: \"most upper level management at sometime became aware of the [Massaro] allegations and ensured all proper WWE protocols were followed, including privacy for the alleged victim.\" That month, Vice News reported that the Naval Criminal Investigative Service had investigated Massaro's allegations from June 2019 to January 2020, although no further information about the investigation other than its existence is known. A further report by Vice News revealed that Massaro had accused Vince McMahon of \"preying on female WWE wrestlers\" and that she believed he had tried to sabotage her wrestling career after she rejected an advance from him.\nMisconduct allegations involving Vince McMahon.\nOne of the first allegations against Vince McMahon was made on April 3, 1992, when Rita Chatterton, a former referee noted for her stint as Rita Marie in the WWF in the 1980s and for being the first female referee in the WWF (possibly in professional wrestling history), made an appearance on Geraldo Rivera's show \"Now It Can Be Told\". She claimed that on July 16, 1986, McMahon tried to force her to perform oral sex on him in his limousine; when she refused, he raped her. Former wrestler Leonard Inzitari has corroborated Chatterton's allegation. Several years later, on February 1, 2006, McMahon was accused of sexual harassment by a worker at a tanning bar in Boca Raton, Florida. At first, the charge appeared to be discredited because McMahon was in Miami for the 2006 Royal Rumble at the time. It was soon clarified that the alleged incident was reported to police on the day of the Rumble, but actually took place the day before. On March 25, it was reported that no charges would be filed against McMahon as a result of the investigation. Both Chatterton and a separate tanning spa worker who alleged that McMahon sexually assaulted her in California in 2011 filed civil sex abuse lawsuits against him in late 2022. McMahon would agree to pay Chatterton an undisclosed multimillion-dollar legal settlement.\nIn 2014, activist investor Emmanuel Lemelson stated that he believed the company had made material misrepresentations in its financial reporting and called for new leadership or a sale of the company. Lemelson's analysis was credited with an $800 million drop in the market capitalization of the stock.\nIn April 2022, the WWE board began investigating a $3 million hush-money settlement that McMahon paid over an alleged affair with a former employee of the company. The investigation also revealed other nondisclosure agreements related to misconduct claims by other women in the company against McMahon and executive John Laurinaitis, totaling $12 million. This eventually led to McMahon retiring from all of his positions on July 22, 2022, and a change in leadership of the WWE for the first time since 1982; he would later return to the company in January 2023 as executive chairman.\nThe company would eventually report $19.6 million in unrecorded payments made by Vince McMahon between 2006 and 2022.\nIn January 2024, McMahon's history of having a role with the WWE ended amid new allegation by ex-WWE employee Janel Grant. Grant accused McMahon and John Laurinaitis of not only sexually assaulting her, but also sex trafficking. The allegation also led to Slim Jim pausing its sponsorship of WWE events.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After his father was dethroned in 1870, he moved to England with his family. On his father's death in January 1873, he was proclaimed by the Bonapartist faction as Napol\u00e9on IV.\nIn England, he trained as a British Army officer. Keen to see action, he persuaded the British to allow him to participate in the Anglo-Zulu War. In 1879, serving with British forces, he was killed in a skirmish with a group of Zulus. His early death caused an international sensation and sent shockwaves throughout Europe, as he was the last serious dynastic hope for the restoration of the House of Bonaparte to the throne of France.\nBiography.\nLouis-Napol\u00e9on was born at the Tuileries Palace in Paris, and he was baptised on 14 June 1856 at Notre Dame Cathedral. His godfather was Pope Pius IX, whose representative, Cardinal Patrizi, officiated. His godmother was Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais's daughter, Josephine, the Queen of Sweden, who was represented by Grand Duchess St\u00e9phanie of Baden.\nHis education, after a false start under the academic historian Francis Monnier, was from 1867 supervised by General Frossard as governor, assisted by Augustin Filon as a tutor. His English nurse, Miss Shaw, was recommended by Queen Victoria and taught the prince English from an early age. His valet Xavier Uhlmann and his inseparable friend Louis Conneau also figured prominently in his life. The young prince was known by the nickname \"Loulou\" in his family circle. In 1868, he visited Corsica and attended the centenary festival of the annexation of the island to France.\nAt the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871, he accompanied his father as a sub-lieutenant to the front. The prince was present on the hills above Saarbr\u00fccken during the engagement at their base. Still, when the war began to go against the Imperial army, his father sent him to the border with Belgium. In September, his father sent him a message to cross over into Belgium. He travelled from there to England, arriving on 6 September, where his parents joined him, the Second Empire having been abolished. The family settled in England at Camden Place in Chislehurst, Kent. Upon his father's death in 1873, Bonapartists proclaimed him Napoleon IV. On his 18th birthday, a large crowd gathered to cheer him at Camden Place.\nThe prince attended elementary lectures in physics at King's College London. In 1872, he applied and was accepted to the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. He finished seventh in his class of thirty-four and came top in riding and fencing. He then served for a time with the Royal Artillery at Aldershot.\nDuring the 1870s, there was some talk of a marriage between him and Queen Victoria's youngest daughter, Princess Beatrice. Queen Victoria also reportedly believed that it would be best for \"the peace of Europe\" if the prince became Emperor of France. The prince remained a devout Catholic, and he retained hopes that the Bonapartist cause might eventually triumph if the secularising Third Republic failed. He supported the tactics of Eug\u00e8ne Rouher over those of Prince Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me, breaking with Napol\u00e9on-J\u00e9r\u00f4me in 1876.\nWith the outbreak of the Zulu War in 1879, the prince, with the rank of lieutenant, forced the hand of the British military to allow him to take part in the conflict, despite the objections of Rouher and other Bonapartists. He was only allowed to go to Africa by the special pleading of his mother, Empress Eug\u00e9nie, and by the intervention of Queen Victoria herself. He left England on 27 February 1879 with letters of introduction from the Duke of Cambridge, the British commander-in-chief, in the hope he might be allowed to follow the movements of the troops. Once he arrived at Durban, he joined the General's Head-Quarters and met Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford, the commander in South Africa, on 9 April and was nominally placed on his staff. The prince accompanied Chelmsford on his march into Zululand. Keen to see action and full of enthusiasm, he was warned by Lieutenant Arthur Brigge, a close friend, \"not to do anything rash and to avoid running unnecessary risks. I reminded him of the Empress at home and his party in France.\"\nChelmsford, mindful of his duty, attached the prince to the staff of Colonel Richard Harrison of the Royal Engineers, where it was felt he could be active but safe. Harrison was responsible for the column's transport and for reconnaissance of the forward route on the way to Ulundi, the Zulu capital. While he welcomed the presence of the prince, he was told by Chelmsford that the prince must be accompanied at all times by a strong escort. Lieutenant Jahleel Brenton Carey, a French speaker and British subject from Guernsey, was given particular charge of him. The prince took part in several reconnaissance missions. However, his eagerness for action almost led him into an early ambush when he exceeded orders in a party led by Colonel Redvers Buller. Despite this, on the evening of 31 May 1879, Harrison agreed to allow the prince to scout in a forward party scheduled to leave in the morning, mistakenly believing that the path ahead was free of Zulu skirmishers.\nDeath.\nOn the morning of 1 June 1879, the troop set out, earlier than intended and without the whole escort, largely owing to the prince's impatience. Led by Carey, the scouts rode deeper into Zululand. Without Harrison or Buller present to restrain him, the prince took command from Carey, even though the latter had seniority. At noon, the prince halted the troop at a temporarily deserted kraal. The prince and Carey made some sketches of the terrain and used part of the thatch to make a fire. No lookout was posted. As they were preparing to leave, about 40 Zulus fired upon them and rushed towards them, screaming. The prince ran to mount his horse and was able to grab onto the holster on the saddle of his horse. The prince's horse then dashed off before he could mount. After about , the strap the prince was clinging to broke and the horse kicked the prince in the belly, winding him. The prince fell beneath his horse, and his right arm was trampled. He leapt up, drawing his revolver with his left hand, and started to run, but the Zulus outpaced him.\nThe prince fired three shots from his revolver at his assailants, but he missed each shot. The prince then fired two more shots, albeit slower in order to better aim. However, these, too, missed. One of the prince's assailants, a Zulu named Langalibalele, threw his spear at the prince, but missed. Another spear, thrown by a Zulu named Zabanga, struck the prince's left shoulder. The prince tried to fight on, wielding the spear thrown by Langalibalele in his right hand and his revolver in his left. However, weakened by his wounds, the prince sank to the ground and was overwhelmed. Zabanga stabbed the prince again with an assegai, followed by Gwabakana; and then the prince suffered a final blow from Klabawathunga \u2013 who stabbed the prince in the right eye \u2013 penetrating the prince's brain and killing him. When the prince's corpse was recovered the next day, it was found naked and an examination by surgeon-major F. B. Scott counted 18 wounds \u2013 all of which were stab wounds.\nAccording to later testimonies from several of the Zulu men who had participated in the ambush of the prince's patrol, only eight of the stab wounds were inflicted upon the prince while he was still alive \u2013 the remaining ten stab wounds were done to the prince's corpse. This was due to the ambushers observing the customary Zulu \"hlomula\" ritual, which entailed stabbing the body of an already fallen adversary. The practice was related to the hunt, when all the participants of the hunt were expected to stab the carcass of a particularly formidable kill, like a lion or buffalo. To do the same to a human foe was to acknowledge that he had fought with the ferocity of a dangerous wild animal. Langalibalele confirmed that \"hlomula\" was performed on the prince's corpse because he had \"fought like a lion\". It also transpired from the testimonies of the prince's Zulu assailants that the prince's corpse was found naked because Klabawathunga had ritually stripped the prince's body of all his apparel, except for a few medals and the locket around the prince's neck which contained a picture of his mother. After giving the prince's clothes to another Zulu man named Dabayane to hold onto, Klabawathunga explained that he personally performed a slight incision on the prince's naked abdomen in order to observe the customary Zulu \"qaqa\" ritual, which was customarily performed on the corpses of slain foes for the purposes of removing a perceived contagious ritual pollution that followed homicide, called \"umnyama\" in isiZulu (meaning 'dark contagion'). It was believed that the swelling that occurred in corpses was due to the homicide victim's soul trying but failing to escape the decaying body, and therefore the killer had a duty to make a hole in their victim to allow the soul to escape lest the killer's own body swell like a corpse. This was the traditional Zulu explanation for the observable swelling of the body which occurs in corpses due to the fermentation of butyric acid in the gut. The prince's bloodstained clothes had meanwhile been removed in order for Klabawathunga to observe the customary Zulu ritual of \"zila\", where a killer was required to wear their victim's clothes (polluted by the harmful influences of his blood) while observing customary ritual abstentions in order to cleanse themself of the crime of homicide. The Zulus had not looted the prince's jewellery because it was seen as a dishonourable thing to do to a warrior, and because it was believed the prince's spirit would haunt them if they stole the jewellery, which was misconstrued for a magical talisman.\nTwo troopers of the Natal Native Horse, Abel and Rogers, as well the Zulu guide accompanying them, died with the prince during the Zulu ambush. Carey and the four surviving men came together about from where the prince made his final stand but did not fire at the Zulus. Carey led his men back to camp. The prince's body was recovered the next day. After a court of inquiry, a court-martial, and intervention by Empress Eug\u00e9nie and Queen Victoria, Carey returned to his regiment. Carey died in Bombay on 22\u00a0February 1883.\nLouis-Napol\u00e9on's death caused an international sensation. Rumours spread in France that the prince had been intentionally \"disposed of\" by the British. Alternatively, the French republicans or the Freemasons were blamed. In one account, Queen Victoria was accused of arranging the whole thing, a theory that was later dramatised by Maurice Rostand in his play \"Napoleon\u00a0IV\". The Zulus later claimed that they would not have killed him if they had known who he was. Langalabalele, his chief assailant, was killed in July at the Battle of Ulundi. Eug\u00e9nie later made a pilgrimage to Sobuza's kraal, where her son had died, and where the Prince Imperial Memorial, paid for by Queen Victoria, had been erected. The prince, who had begged to be allowed to go to war and who had worried his commanders by his dash and daring, was described by Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley, as \"a plucky young man, and he died a soldier's death. What on earth could he have done better?\"\nHis remains were brought back to Spithead on board the British troopship , and thence transferred onto HMS \"Enchantress\" for sailing on to Woolwich Arsenal; overnight, he lay in state in the western octagonal guardhouse by the riverfront. The funeral procession, including Queen Victoria, went from there to Chislehurst, where he was buried in St Mary's Catholic Church. On 9\u00a0January 1888, his body was transferred to a special mausoleum constructed by his mother as the Imperial Crypt at St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough, next to his father.\nThe Prince Imperial had appointed Prince Napol\u00e9on Victor Bonaparte as his heir, thus skipping the genealogically senior heir, Victor's father, Prince Napol\u00e9on.\nLegacy.\nIn 1880, the inhabitants of Chislehurst erected a monument to the Prince Imperial on Chislehurst Common near Camden Place, which is now Grade II listed. In the 1950s, the road which passes the monument, previously called Station Road, was renamed Prince Imperial Road in his memory. Until 1966 the old STD telephone dialing code using an alphanumeric combination for Chislehurst and Bickley was 467 which spells out IMP, for 'IMPerial'.\nThe Australian Rules football club Footscray, inspired by the story of the prince's death, renamed their club to the Prince Imperial Football Club in the early 1880s, but they reverted to Footscray a mere two years later.\nThe asteroid moon Petit-Prince was named after the Prince Imperial in 1998, because it orbits an asteroid named after his mother (45 Eugenia).\nIn literature.\nThe death is presented in some detail in G. A. Henty's \"The Young Colonists: A Tale of The Zulu and Boer Wars\" (1885).\nIn the R. F. Delderfield novel \"Long Summer Day\" (the first of the \"A Horseman Riding By\" trilogy), Boer War veteran Paul Craddock buys a farm in 1900 or 1901. The middle-aged estate manager, Rudd, is somewhat embittered at having been one of the soldiers who had failed to rescue the Prince Imperial in 1879. Craddock is aware of the events because, by coincidence, he had been born that very day.\nEmma Lazarus wrote sonnets, under the common title of \"Destiny\", commemorating the prince's birth and death.\nThe contemporary Italian poet Giosu\u00e8 Carducci composed a poem in Alcaic stanzas in his memory in 1879 (later in his \"Odi Barbare\"), in which he described the Prince's death as follows (vv. 1 - 4) \"Questo la inconscia zagaglia barbara / prostr\u00f2, spegnendo li occhi di fulgida / vita sorrisi da i fantasmi / fluttuanti ne l'azzurro immenso\". (\"The unconscious barbarous assegai / prostrated him and extinguished his eyes / of radiant life, at which smiled the ghosts / floating in the immense blue\").\nIn the play \"Napoleon IV\" by Maurice Rostand, the prince is killed in a carefully planned ambush arranged with the connivance of Queen Victoria.\nIn a 1943 \"Southern Daily Echo\" article, former Sapper George Harding (2nd Company Royal Engineers) recalled being ordered to take a horse ambulance and find the prince's body and bring it back to the column. The Prince Imperial had been out on reconnaissance mission with a party of the 17th Lancers. Describing the mission, he said\nWe advanced to a dried-up river bed and had to cut away the banks to get the ambulance across. Eventually, we reached a kraal beside a large mealie field where we found the bodies of the Prince and some of his party. They had been surprised by Zulus as they rested in the kraal. The Zulus broke out of the mealie field and killed them before they could remount their horses. The Prince had been stabbed 16 times with assegais. We made a rough coffin and put his body in the ambulance. After burying the other bodies where they were found, we went back to the column. The Prince's body was taken back to England for burial.\nThe Hideous Silence (BBC Radio, 1975) by Michael Robson, broadcast on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Saturday Night Theatre is rooted in the historical controversy surrounding the death Louis Napoleon. The play is set years after the event in colonial India, focusing on the disgraced British Army officer, Lieutenant Jahleel Brenton Carey, whose career and honour were destroyed by his connection to the Prince's death. The play and its title concerns the years of ostracisation that Carey endured, leading to his pitiful death in Bombay in 1883.\nThe Prince Imperial is a minor character in Donald Serrell Thomas's Sherlock Holmes pastiche novel \"Death on a Pale Horse\" (2013).\nTitles, styles, honours and arms.\nHe was styled Prince Imperial of France from birth.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From 28 July to 4 September 1870, she was the \"de facto\" head of state of France.\nBorn to prominent Spanish nobility, Eug\u00e9nie was educated in France, Spain, and England. As Empress, she used her influence to champion \"authoritarian and clerical policies\"; her involvement in politics earned her much criticism from contemporaries. Napol\u00e9on and Eug\u00e9nie had one child together, Louis-Napol\u00e9on, Prince Imperial (1856\u20131879). After the fall of the Empire, the three lived in exile in England; Eug\u00e9nie outlived both her husband and son and spent the remainder of her life working to commemorate their memories and the memory of the Second French Empire.\nYouth.\nMar\u00eda Eugenia Ignacia Agustina was born on 5 May 1826 in Granada, Spain. She was the youngest child and daughter of Don Cipriano de Palafox y Portocarrero, three times Grandee of Spain, whose titles included 13th Duke of Pe\u00f1aranda de Duero, 9th Count of Montijo, 15th Count of Teba, 8th Count of Ablitas, 8th Count of Fuentidue\u00f1a, 14th Marquis of Ardales, 17th Marquis of Moya and 13th Marquis of la Algaba, and Mar\u00eda Manuela Enriqueta Kirkpatrick de Closeburn y Grivegn\u00e9e. Mar\u00eda de Grivegn\u00e9e was the daughter of the Scots-born William Kirkpatrick of Closeburn (1764\u20131837), who became United States consul to M\u00e1laga, and later was a wholesale wine merchant, and his wife, Marie Fran\u00e7oise de Grivegn\u00e9e (born 1769), daughter of Li\u00e8ge-born Henri, Baron de Grivegn\u00e9e and Spanish wife, Do\u00f1a Francisca Antonia de Gallegos y Delgado (1751\u20131853). In later life, the Empress told Lady Helena Gleichen that \"she was born in the middle of an earthquake and her mother was carried out of the house and laid under a tree, her family ever after used to mock at her saying, 'The mountain was in travail and it brought forth a mouse.'\"\nEugenia's elder sister, Mar\u00eda Francisca de Sales de Palafox Portocarrero y Kirkpatrick, nicknamed \"Paca\", who inherited most of the family honours and was 14th Duchess of Pe\u00f1aranda, Grandee of Spain and 9th Countess of Montijo, a title later ceded to Eugenia, married the 15th Duke of Alba in 1849. Until her marriage in 1853, Eugenia variously used the titles Countess of Teba or Countess of Montijo. However, some family titles were inherited by her elder sister, through which they passed to the House of Alba. After the death of her father, Eugenia became the 9th Countess of Teba and is named as such in the \"Almanach de Gotha\" (1901 edition). After Eugenia's demise, all titles of the Montijo family came to the Fitz-Jameses (the Dukes of Alba and Berwick).\nOn 18 July 1834, Mar\u00eda Manuela and her daughters left Madrid for Paris, fleeing a cholera outbreak and the dangers of the First Carlist War. The previous day, Eugenia had witnessed a riot and murder in the square outside their residence, Casa Ariza.\nEug\u00e9nie de Montijo, as she became known in France, was formally educated mostly in Paris, beginning at the fashionable, traditionalist Convent of the Sacr\u00e9 C\u0153ur from 1835 to 1836. A more compatible school was the progressive Gymnase Normal, Civil et Orthosomatique, from 1836 to 1837, which appealed to her athletic side (a school report praised her strong liking for athletic exercise, and although an indifferent student, that her character was \"good, generous, active and firm\"). In 1837, Eug\u00e9nie and Paca briefly attended a boarding school for girls on Royal York Crescent in Clifton, Bristol, to learn English. Eug\u00e9nie was teased as \"Carrots\" for her red hair and tried to run away to India, making it as far as climbing on board a ship at Bristol docks. In August 1837, they returned to school in Paris. However, much of the girls' education took place at home, under the tutelage of English governesses Miss Cole and Miss Flowers, and family friends such as Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Henri Beyle.\nIn March 1839, on the death of their father in Madrid, the girls left Paris to rejoin their mother there. In Spain, Eug\u00e9nie grew up into a headstrong and physically daring young woman, devoted to horseriding and a range of other sports. She was rescued from drowning and twice attempted suicide after romantic disappointments. She was very interested in politics and became devoted to the Bonapartist cause, under the influence of Eleanore Gordon, a former mistress of Louis Napol\u00e9on. Due to her mother's role as a lavish society hostess, Eug\u00e9nie became acquainted with Queen Isabella II of Spain and the prime minister Ram\u00f3n Narv\u00e1ez. Mar\u00eda Manuela was increasingly anxious to find a husband for her daughter and took her on trips to Paris again in 1849 and England in 1851.\nMarriage.\nShe first met Prince Louis Napol\u00e9on after he had become president of the Second Republic with her mother at a reception given by the \"prince-president\" at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace on 12 April 1849. \"What is the road to your heart?\" Napoleon demanded to know. \"Through the chapel, Sire\", she answered.\nIn a speech on 22 January 1853, Napoleon III, after becoming emperor, formally announced his engagement, saying, \"I have preferred a woman whom I love and respect to a woman unknown to me, with whom an alliance would have had advantages mixed with sacrifices\". They were wed on 29 January 1853 in a civil ceremony at the Tuileries, and on the 30th, there was a grander religious ceremony at Notre Dame.\nThe marriage had come after considerable activity concerning who would make a suitable match, often toward titled royals and with an eye to foreign policy. The final choice was opposed in many quarters. Eug\u00e9nie was considered of too little social standing by some. In the United Kingdom, \"The Times\" made light of the latter concern, emphasizing that the parvenu Bonapartes were marrying into Grandees and one of the most important established houses in the peerage of Spain: \"We learn with some amusement that this romantic event in the annals of the French Empire has called forth the strongest opposition and provoked the utmost irritation. The Imperial family, the Council of Ministers, and even the lower coteries of the palace or its purlieus, all affect to regard this marriage as an amazing humiliation...\" \nEug\u00e9nie found childbearing extraordinarily difficult. An initial miscarriage in 1853, after a three-month pregnancy, frightened and soured her. On 16 March 1856, after a two-day labor that endangered both mother and child, and from which Eug\u00e9nie made a prolonged recovery, the empress gave birth to an only son, Napol\u00e9on Eug\u00e8ne Louis Jean Joseph Bonaparte, styled \"Prince Imp\u00e9rial\".\nAfter marriage, it did not take long for her husband to stray as Eug\u00e9nie found sex with him \"disgusting\". It is doubtful that she allowed further approaches by her husband once she had given him an heir. He subsequently resumed his \"petites distractions\" with other women.\nEmpress.\nPublic life.\nEug\u00e9nie faithfully performed the duties of an empress, entertaining guests and accompanying the emperor to balls, opera, and theater. After her marriage, her ladies-in-waiting consisted of six (later twelve) \"dames du palais\", most of whom were chosen from among the acquaintances to the empress before her marriage, headed by the \"Grand-Maitresse\" Anne Debelle, Princesse d'Essling, and the \"dame d'honneur\", Pauline de Bassano. In 1855 Franz Xaver Winterhalter painted \"The Empress Eug\u00e9nie Surrounded by her Ladies in Waiting\", where it depicted Eug\u00e9nie, sitting beside the \"Grand-Maitresse\" in a countryside setting, with eight of her ladies-in-waiting.\nShe traveled to Egypt for the official opening of the Suez Canal and represented her husband whenever he traveled outside France. In 1860, she visited Algiers with Napoleon. She strongly advocated equality for women; she pressured the Ministry of National Education to give the first baccalaureate diploma to a woman and tried unsuccessfully to induce the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise to elect the writer George Sand as its first female member.\nHer husband often consulted her on important questions. She acted as regent during his absences in 1859, 1865 and 1870, as he often accompanied his soldiers on the battlefield to motivate them during the wars. In the 1860s, she often attended meetings of the Council of Ministers, even leading the meetings for a brief space of time in 1866 when her husband was away from Paris. A Catholic and a conservative, her influence countered any liberal tendencies in the emperor's policies. Her strong preference was for hereditary monarchy and she made repeated displays of support for members of European royalty who were in crisis, like supporting a restoration of the Bourbons in Spain or trying to help the deposed monarchs of Parma and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. According to Nancy Nichols Barker, \"her ideas on the principles of government were ill formed and included a jumble of Bonapartism and Legitimism, whose incompatibility she seemed not to even recognize.\"\nShe was a staunch defender of papal temporal powers in Italy and of ultramontanism. Because of this she ardently tried to dissuade her husband from recognizing the new Kingdom of Italy, which was formed after Sardinia's 1861 annexation of the Bourbon-ruled Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and all of the pope's territory outside Rome. She also supported keeping a French garrison in Rome to protect the papacy's continued hold on the city. Her opposition to Italian unification earned her the enmity of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, who stated that \"the emperor is weakening visibly and the empress is our enemy and works with the priests. If I had her in my hands I would teach her well what women are good for and with what she should meddle.\" She also clashed with the French foreign minister \u00c9douard Thouvenel over the question of the French garrison in Rome. Much to Eug\u00e9nie's chagrin, Thouvenel negotiated an agreement to wind down the French military presence in exchange for a guarantee of papal sovereignty from the new Italian kingdom. The Duke of Persigny blamed her influence when Thouvenel was dismissed by the emperor, declaring to Louis-Napol\u00e9on that, \"You allow yourself to be ruled by your wife just as I do. But I only compromise my future...whereas you sacrifice your own interests and those of your son and the country at large.\"\nShe was blamed for the fiasco of the French intervention in Mexico and the eventual death of Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. However, the assertion of her clericalism and influence on the side of conservatism is often countered by other authors.\nIn 1868, Empress Eug\u00e9nie visited the Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace in Constantinople, the home to Pertevniyal Sultan, mother of Abdulaziz, 32nd sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Pertevniyal became outraged by the forwardness of Eug\u00e9nie taking the arm of one of her sons while he gave a tour of the palace garden, and she slapped the empress on the stomach as a reminder that they were not in France. According to another account, Pertevniyal perceived the presence of a foreign woman within her quarters of the seraglio as an insult. She reportedly slapped Eug\u00e9nie across the face, almost resulting in an international incident.\nRole in the arts.\nThe Empress possessed one of the most important jewellery collections of her time; Catherine Granger recalls that her purchases were estimated at the enormous sum of 3,600,000 francs, a sum to be compared with the 200,000 francs devoted to the purchase of works of art for her personal collection. The American jeweller Charles Tiffany, who had already acquired the French crown jewels, bought most of the former Empress's jewels from the government and sold them to the ladies of American high society.\nThe empress was \"perhaps the last Royal personage to have a direct and immediate influence on fashion\". She set the standard for contemporary fashion at a time when the luxury industries of Paris were flourishing. Gowns, colors, and hairstyles \"\u00e0 l'imp\u00e9ratrice\" were avidly copied from the empress throughout Europe and America. She was famous for her large crinolines and for rotating her outfits throughout the day, with a different dress for the morning, afternoon, evening, and night. The British satirical magazine \"Punch\" christened her variously as the \"Queen of Fashion\", \"Imperatrice de la Mode\", \"Countess of Crinoline\", and \"Goddess of the Bustles\". She never wore the same gown twice, and in this way commissioned and acquired an enormous wardrobe, which she disposed of in annual sales to benefit charity. Her favored couturier, Charles Frederick Worth, provided hundreds of gowns to her over the years and was appointed the official dressmaker to the court in 1869. In the late 1860s, she caused a shift in fashion by turning against the crinoline and adopting Worth's \"new\" slimmer silhouettes with the skirt gathered in the back over a bustle.\nEug\u00e9nie's influence on contemporary taste extended into the decorative arts. She was a great admirer of Queen Marie Antoinette and decorated her interiors in revivals of the Louis XV and Louis XVI styles. A general vogue arose for 18th century French design, becoming known as \"Style Louis XVI Imp\u00e9ratrice\". According to Nancy Nichols Barker, her admiration for Marie Antoinette \"was nearly an obsession. She collected her portraits and trinkets, lived in her suite at Saint-Cloud, had constructed a small model of the Petit Trianon in the park, and frequently engaged H\u00fcbner in lugubrious conversation about the fate of the martyred queen.\"\nIn 1863, the Empress established a museum of Asian art called the \"mus\u00e9e Chinois\" (Chinese Museum) at the Palace of Fontainebleau. She carefully curated the displays of her museum, constituting diplomatic gifts given to her by an embassy from Siam in 1860, as well as loot taken from the Old Summer Palace outside Beijing by French troops during the Second Opium War. General Charles Cousin-Montauban had sent crates of this loot to Eug\u00e9nie as a gift, with the first shipment arriving in February 1861. The collection numbers some 800 objects, with 300 coming from the sack of the Summer Palace.\nBiarritz.\nIn 1854, Emperor Napoleon III and Eug\u00e9nie bought several acres of dunes in Biarritz and gave the engineer Dagueret the task of establishing a summer home surrounded by gardens, woods, meadows, a pond and outbuildings. Napoleon III chose the location near Spain so his wife would not get homesick for her native country. The house was called the Villa Eug\u00e9nie, today the H\u00f4tel du Palais. The presence of the imperial couple attracted other European royalty like the British monarchs Queen Victoria and the Spanish king Alfonso XIII and made Biarritz well-known.\nRole in Franco-Prussian War.\nThe Empress held anti-Prussian views and disliked the North German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, for what she perceived as his \"meddling\" in Spanish affairs. She believed that France's status as a great power was under threat, and that a victory against Prussia would secure her son's future rule. Maxime du Camp claimed that, after the Prussian victory over Austria in 1866, the Empress would often state that \"Catholic France could not support the neighborhood of a great Protestant power.\" In 1870, when the diplomatic crisis which would lead to the Franco-Prussian War erupted over Prussia's Hohenzollern candidate for the Spanish throne, Eug\u00e9nie was key in pushing her husband toward supporting what she called \"my war\" (\"C'est ma guerre\"). In one instance she pointed to the couple's son in front of her husband and declared \"this child will never reign unless we repair the misfortunes of Sadowa\". Adolphe Thiers included her, the foreign secretary the Duc de Gramont, \u00c9mile Ollivier, and the military in the pro-war camp behind the Emperor, who was himself indecisive.\nAfter the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War, Eug\u00e9nie remained in Paris as Regent while Napoleon III and the Prince Imperial travelled to join the troops at the German front. When the news of several French defeats reached Paris on 7 August, it was greeted with disbelief and dismay. Prime Minister \u00c9mile Ollivier and the chief of staff of the army, Marshal Le B\u0153uf, both resigned, and Eugenie took it upon herself to name a new government. She chose General Cousin-Montauban, better known as the count of Palikao, 74 years old, as her new prime minister. The count of Palikao named Mar\u00e9chal Francois Achille Bazaine, the commander of the French forces in Lorraine, as the new overall military commander. Napoleon III proposed returning to Paris, realizing that he was doing no good for the army. The empress responded by telegraph: \"Don't think of coming back unless you want to unleash a terrible revolution. They will say you quit the army to flee the danger.\" The emperor agreed to remain with the army but sent his son back to the capital. With the empress directing the country and Bazaine commanding the army, the emperor no longer had any real role to play. At the front, the emperor told Marshal Le B\u0153uf, \"we've both been dismissed.\"\nThe army was ultimately defeated, and Napoleon III gave himself up to the Prussians at the Battle of Sedan. The news of the capitulation reached Paris on 3 September. When the empress received word that the emperor and the army were prisoners, she reacted by shouting at the Emperor's personal aide, \"No! An emperor does not capitulate! He is dead!...They are trying to hide it from me. Why didn't he kill himself! Doesn't he know he has dishonored himself?!\". Later, when hostile crowds formed near the Tuileries Palace and the staff began to flee, the empress slipped out with one of her entourage and sought sanctuary with her American dentist, Thomas W. Evans, who took her to Deauville. From there, on 7 September, she took the yacht of a British official to England. In the meantime, on 4 September, a group of republican deputies proclaimed the return of the Republic, and the creation of a Government of National Defense.\nFrom 5 September 1870 until 19 March 1871, Napoleon III and his entourage, including Joseph Bonaparte's grandson Louis Joseph Benton, were held in comfortable captivity in a castle at Wilhelmsh\u00f6he, near Kassel. Eug\u00e9nie traveled incognito to Germany to visit Napoleon.\nAfter the Franco-Prussian War.\nWhen the Second Empire was overthrown after France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the empress and her husband took permanent refuge in England and settled at Camden Place in Chislehurst, Kent. Her husband, Napoleon III, died in 1873, and her son died in 1879 while fighting in the Zulu War in South Africa, with Eug\u00e9nie visiting his death site on the first anniversary. Before her son's death and after she was widowed, she attempted to join Bonapartists and Legitimists in political alliance against the French Third Republic by making overtures to the Count of Chambord (the Legitimist claimant to the throne of France) and proposing that he adopt her son. The idea was rejected by the Count of Chambord. In 1885, she moved to Farnborough Hill in Farnborough, Hampshire, and to the Villa Cyrnos (named after the ancient Greek for Corsica), which was built for her at Cape Martin, between Menton and Nice, where she lived in retirement.\nAfter the deaths of her husband and son, as her health started to deteriorate, she spent some time at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight; her physician recommended she visit Bournemouth which was, in Victorian times, famed as a health spa resort. During an afternoon visit in 1881, she called on the queen of Sweden, at her residence 'Crag Head'. Her health recovered sufficiently to allow her to travel internationally; she is recorded to have visited the Tomb of Yuya and Thuya (KV46) in the Valley of the Kings during its clearance in the spring of 1905, during which visit she sat on a chair that unbeknownst to her was the 3,000-year-old Throne of Princess Sitamun.\nHer deposed family's friendly association with the United Kingdom was commemorated in 1887 when she became the godmother of Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (1887\u20131969), daughter of Princess Beatrice, who later became queen consort of Alfonso XIII of Spain. She was also close to Empress consort Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia, who last visited her, along with Emperor Nicholas II, in 1909.\nOn the outbreak of World War I, she donated her steam yacht \"Thistle\" to the British Navy. She funded a military hospital at Farnborough Hill as well as made large donations to French hospitals, for which she was appointed Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in 1919.\nDeath, burial and aftermath.\nThe former empress died on 11 July 1920, aged 94, during a visit to her relative the 17th Duke of Alba, at the Liria Palace in Madrid in her native Spain, and she is interred in the Imperial Crypt at St Michael's Abbey, Farnborough, with her husband and her son. The British King George V attended her requiem.\nAfter World War I, Eugenie lived long enough to see the collapse of other European monarchies, such as those of Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary. She left her possessions to various relatives: her Spanish estates went to the grandsons of her sister Paca; the house in Farnborough with all collections to the heir of her son, Prince Victor Bonaparte; Villa Cyrnos to his sister Princess Laetitia of Aosta. Liquid assets were divided into three parts and given to the above relatives except for the sum of 100,000 francs bequeathed to the Committee for Rebuilding the Cathedral of Reims.\nLegacy.\nThe empress has been commemorated in space; the asteroid 45 Eugenia was named after her, and its moon Petit-Prince after the prince imperial.\nShe had an extensive and unique jewelry collection, most of which later was owned by the Brazilian socialite Aim\u00e9e de Heeren. De Heeren collected jewelry and was fond of the empress as both were considered to be the \"Queens of Biarritz\"; both spent summers on the C\u00f4te Basque. Impressed by the elegance, style and design of the jewelry of the neo-classical era, in 1858, she had a boutique in the Royal Palace under the name Royale Collections.\nShe was honoured by John Gould who gave the white-headed fruit dove the scientific name \"Ptilinopus eugeniae\".\nIn popular culture.\nGeorge W. M. Reynolds's penny dreadful \"The Empress Eugenie's Boudoir\" tells of the goings-on in the French court during the days of the Second Empire and features the titular empress as one of its lead characters.\nNamed for the empress, the Eug\u00e9nie hat is a style of women's chapeau worn dramatically tilted and drooped over one eye; its brim is folded up sharply at both sides in the style of a riding topper, often with one long ostrich plume streaming behind it. The hat was popularized by film star Greta Garbo and enjoyed a vogue in the early 1930s, becoming \"hysterically popular\".

Abdul Kalam", "text": "President of India from 2002 to 2007\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ( ; 15 October 1931\u00a0\u2013 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the president of India from 2002 to 2007.\nBorn and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the \"Missile Man of India\" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in \"Pokhran-II\" nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such test after the first test in 1974.\nKalam was elected as the president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. He was widely referred to as the \"People's President\". He engaged in teaching, writing and public service after his presidency. He was a recipient of several awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.\nWhile delivering a lecture at IIM Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours. A memorial was inaugurated near his home town in 2017.\nEarly life and education.\nAvul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage center of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu). His father, Jainulabdeen Marakayar, was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque, and his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. His father owned a boat that ferried Hindu pilgrims between Rameswaram and Dhanushkodi.\nKalam was the youngest of four brothers and a sister in the family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading goods and transporting passengers between the Indian mainland and the Pamban Island and to and from Sri Lanka. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge connecting Pamban Island to mainland India in 1914, the businesses failed. As a result, apart from the ancestral home, the other family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, and the family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy, he delivered newspapers to support the family's meager income.\nIn his school years, Kalam got average grades but was described by his teachers as a bright and hardworking student with a strong desire to learn. He spent hours learning Mathematics. He did his schooling at Schwartz Higher Secondary School in Ramanathapuram. He then graduated in Physics from St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, in 1954.\nKalam moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at the Madras Institute of Technology. While he was working on a class project, the Dean of the institution was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, \"I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline.\" Later, he narrowly missed out on his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the Indian Air Force.\nCareer as a scientist.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n This was my first stage, in which I learnt leadership from three great teachers\u2014Dr Vikram Sarabhai, Prof Satish Dhawan and Dr Brahm Prakash. This was the time of learning and acquisition of knowledge for me.\nAbdul Kalam\nAfter graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in 1960, Kalam became a member of the Defence Research &amp; Development Service and joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) as a scientist. During his early career, he was involved in the design of small hovercraft, and remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Later, he joined the Indian National Committee for Space Research, working under renowned space scientist Vikram Sarabhai. He was interviewed and recruited into Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) by H. G. S. Murthy, the first director of the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station.\nIn 1969, Kalam transferred to ISRO where he became the project director of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980. He had earlier started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the approval from the Government of India to expand the programme to include more engineers. In 1963\u201364, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, and Wallops Flight Facility. Since the late 1970s, Kalam was part of the effort to develop the SLV-3 and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), both of which were successful.\nIn May 1974, Kalam was invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test \"Smiling Buddha\" as the representative of Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, even though he was officially not part of the project. In the 1970s, Kalam directed two projects, \"Project Devil\" and \"Project Valiant\", which sought to develop ballistic missiles using the technology from the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval of the union cabinet, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted funds for these aerospace projects under Kalam's directorship through her discretionary powers. Kalam also played a major role in convincing the cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified projects. His research and leadership brought him recognition in the 1980s, which prompted the government to initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship.\nKalam worked with metallurgist V. S. R. Arunachalam, who was then scientific adviser to the Defence Minister, on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister R. Venkataraman on the simultaneous development of a quiver of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for allocating () for the project titled Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as its chief executive. Kalam played a major role in the development of missiles including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, despite inflated costs and time overruns. He was known as the \"Missile Man of India\" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.\nKalam served as the chief scientific adviser to the prime minister and secretary of the DRDO from July 1992 to December 1999. He played a key organisational, political and technical role in the \"Pokhran-II\" nuclear tests conducted in May 1998. Along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, he served as the chief project coordinator for the tests. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the site test, K. Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a \"fizzle\" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. The claim was refuted and rejected by Kalam and Chidambaram.\nIn 1998, Kalam worked with cardiologist Bhupathiraju Somaraju and developed a low cost coronary stent, named the \"Kalam-Raju stent\". In 2012, the duo designed a tablet computer named the \"Kalam-Raju tablet\" for usage by healthcare workers in rural areas.\nPresidency.\nOn 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance which was in power at the time, expressed its intention to nominate Kalam for the post of the President of India. His candidature was backed by the opposition parties including the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party. After the support for Kalam, incumbent president K. R. Narayanan chose not to seek a re-election. Kalam said of the announcement of his candidature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can give to the people of the country at this juncture.\nOn 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and senior cabinet members. He faced off against Lakshmi Sahgal, and the polling for the presidential election was held on 15 July 2002, in the Indian parliament and the state assemblies, with the media predicting a win for Kalam. The counting was held on 18 July, and Kalam won the elections after securing 922,884 electoral votes as against the 107,366 votes won by Sahgal. He was sworn in as the 11th president of India on 25 July 2002. He was the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy the top chair at Rashtrapati Bhawan.\nDuring his term as president, he was affectionately known as the \"People's President\". He later stated that signing the Office of profit bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure. In September 2003, during an interactive session at PGIMER in Chandigarh, Kalam asserted the need of Uniform Civil Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country. He also took a decision to impose President's rule in Bihar in 2005. However, during his tenure as president, he made no decision on 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him to commute death penalties, including that of terrorist Afzal Guru, who was convicted of conspiracy in the December 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004. He acted only on a single plea, rejecting that of Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.\nTowards the end of his term, on 20 June 2007, Kalam expressed his willingness to consider a second term in office provided there was certainty about his victory in the upcoming presidential election. His name was proposed by the United National Progressive Alliance, but he did receive the support of the ruling United Progressive Alliance. However, two days later, he decided not to contest the election again stating that he wanted to avoid involving the Rashtrapati Bhavan in the political processes.\nIn April 2012, towards the expiry of the term of the 12th president Pratibha Patil, media reports claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term. After the reports, social networking sites witnessed a surge in posts supporting his candidature. While the ruling Indian National Congress opposed the nomination of Kalam, other parties such as the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Trinamool Congress were reported by the media to be keen on his candidature. On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest stating that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPost-presidency.\nAfter leaving office, Kalam returned to teaching, and became a visiting professor at various institutions. He became a visiting professor at IIM Shillong, an honorary professor at his alma mater Anna University in Chennai, and an honorary fellow of the Indian Institute of Science at Bengaluru. In September 2007, he became the first chancellor of the newly established Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology at Thiruvananthapuram. He also conducted lectures for management students in India, and visited China twice at the invitation of the Chinese government to conduct sessions at the Peking University.\nIn 2011, Kalam voiced his support towards the establishment of the nuclear power plant at Koodankulam in Tamil Nadu, giving assurances for the safety of the facility. However, some of the locals were unconvinced by his statements on the safety of the plant, and were hostile to his visit. In May 2012, Kalam launched a programme called \"What Can I Give Movement\" aimed at the youth of India with a central theme of defeating corruption.\nDeath.\nOn 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on \"Creating a Livable Planet Earth\" at IIM Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest. At around 6:35\u00a0p.m. IST, after five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed. He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition, and upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life. Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, he was confirmed dead of a sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45p.m. His purported last words to his aide Srijan Pal Singh were: \"Funny guy! Are you doing well?\"\nAftermath.\nFollowing his death, the people of India paid tributes on social media. The Government of India declared a seven-day state mourning period as a mark of respect. Various leaders from India and abroad condoled the death of Kalam.\nKalam's body was flown to New Delhi on the morning of 28 July, where dignitaries including then president, vice president, and prime minister paid their last respects. His body was placed in his Delhi residence for public viewing. On 29 July, his body was flown to the town of Mandapam via Madurai, and was carried towards his home town of Rameswaram by road. His body was displayed in an open area to allow the public to pay their final respects until 8p.m. that evening. On 30 July 2015, following an Islamic burial prayer performed by the local imam, he was laid to rest at Rameswaram's Pei Karumbu ground with full state honours with over 350,000 people in attendance.\nDr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Memorial was built in memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu in Rameswaram. It was inaugurated by the prime minister Narendra Modi in July 2017. The memorial displays replicas of rockets and missiles which Kalam had worked with, and various acrylic paintings about his life. There is a large statue of Kalam in the entrance showing him playing the veena, and two other smaller statues in sitting and standing posture respectively.\nPersonal life and interests.\nKalam was the youngest of five siblings, the eldest of whom was a sister, Asim Zohra (d.\u20091997), followed by three elder brothers: Mohammed Lebbai (5 November 1916\u20137 March 2021), Mustafa Kalam (d.\u20091999) and Kasim Mohammed (d.\u20091995). He was close to his elder siblings and their extended families throughout his life, and would regularly send small sums of money to his older siblings, though he himself remaining a lifelong bachelor.\nKalam was noted for his integrity and his simple lifestyle. He was a teetotaler, and a vegetarian. Kalam enjoyed writing Tamil poetry, playing the veena (an Indian string instrument), and listening to Carnatic devotional music every day. He never owned a television, and was in the habit of rising at 6:30 or 7a.m. and sleeping by 2a.m. His personal possessions included a few books, a veena, clothing, a compact disc player and a laptop. He left no will, and his possessions went to his eldest brother after his death.\nKalam set a target of interacting with 100,000 students during the two years after his resignation from the post of scientific adviser in 1999. He explained, \"I feel comfortable in the company of young people, particularly high school students. Henceforth, I intend to share with them experiences, helping them to ignite their imagination and preparing them to work for a developed India for which the road map is already available.\" His dream is to let every student to light up the sky with victory using their latent fire in the heart. He had an active interest in other developments in the field of science and technology such as developing biomedical implants. He also supported open source technology over proprietary software, predicting that the use of free software on a large scale would bring the benefits of information technology to more people.\nReligious and spiritual views.\nReligion and spirituality were very important to Kalam throughout his life. He was a practising Sunni Muslim, and daily namaz and fasting during Ramadan were integral to his life. His father was an imam of a mosque, and had strictly instilled these Islamic customs in his children. His father had also impressed upon the young Kalam the value of interfaith respect and dialogue. As Kalam recalled: \"Every evening, my father A.\u00a0P. Jainulabdeen, an imam, Pakshi Lakshmana Sastry, the head priest of the Ramanathaswamy Hindu temple, and a church priest used to sit with hot tea and discuss the issues concerning the island.\" Such early exposure convinced Kalam that the answers to India's multitudinous issues lay in \"dialogue and cooperation\" among the country's religious, social, and political leaders. Moreover, since Kalam believed that \"respect for other faiths\" was one of the key cornerstones of Islam, and he remarked: \"For great men, religion is a way of making friends; small people make religion a fighting tool.\"\nOne component of Kalam's widespread popularity among diverse groups in India, and an enduring aspect of his legacy, is the syncretism he embodied in appreciating various elements of the many spiritual and cultural traditions of India. In addition to his faith in the Quran and Islamic practice, Kalam was well-versed in Hindu traditions, learnt Sanskrit. and read the Bhagavad Gita. In 2002, in one of his early speeches to Parliament after becoming the president, he reiterated his desire for a more united India, stating that \"During the last one year I met a number of spiritual leaders of all religions ... and I would like to endeavour to work for bringing about unity of minds among the divergent traditions of our country\". Describing Kalam as a unifier of diverse traditions, Shashi Tharoor remarked, \"Kalam was a complete Indian, an embodiment of the eclecticism of India's heritage of diversity\". Former deputy prime minister L. K. Advani concurred that Kalam was \"the best exemplar of the Idea of India, one who embodied the best of all the cultural and spiritual traditions that signify India's unity in immense diversity.\nKalam's desire to meet spiritual leaders led him to meet Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the Hindu guru of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), who Kalam would come to consider his ultimate spiritual teacher and guru. Kalam and Pramukh Swami met eight times over a fourteen-year period and on his first meeting on 30 June 2001, Kalam described being immediately drawn to Pramukh Swami's simplicity and spiritual purity. Kalam stated that he was inspired by Pramukh Swami throughout their numerous interactions, and recalled being moved by Swami's equanimity and compassion, citing this incident as one of his motivations for writing his experiences as a book later. Summarising the effect that Pramukh Swami had on him, Kalam stated that \"[Pramukh Swami] has indeed transformed me. He is the ultimate stage of the spiritual ascent in my life ... Pramukh Swamiji has put me in a God-synchronous orbit. No manoeuvres are required any more, as I am placed in my final position in eternity.\"\nWritings.\nKalam has authored various books during his career, and his books have garnered interest in various countries.\nIn his book \"India 2020\", he strongly advocated an action plan to develop India into a \"knowledge superpower\" and a developed nation by 2020. He regarded his work on India's nuclear weapons programme as a way to assert India's place as a future superpower.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I have identified five areas where India has a core competence for integrated action: (1) agriculture and food processing; (2) education and healthcare; (3) information and communication technology; (4) infrastructure, reliable and quality electric power, surface transport and infrastructure for all parts of the country; and (5) self-reliance in critical technologies. These five areas are closely inter-related and if advanced in a coordinated way, will lead to food, economic and national security.\nKalam described a \"transformative moment\" in his life in his book \"\". When he asked Pramukh Swami on how India might realise his vision of development, Swami answered to add a sixth area of developing faith in God and spirituality to overcome the current climate of crime and corruption.\nThe following are the books authored by Kalam:\nAwards and honours.\nKalam received honorary doctorates from various universities. The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Bhushan in 1981 and the Padma Vibhushan in 1990. In 1997, he was awarded India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. He received the Indira Gandhi Award for National Integration in 1997, Savarkar Award in 1998, and Ramanujan Award in 2000. In 2008, he was the recipient of Hoover Medal. In 2013, he was awarded the Von Braun Award by the National Space Society \"to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project\".\nLegacy.\nKalam's birthday is celebrated as World Students' Day in India. In 2012, Kalam was ranked second in \"the Greatest Indian\" poll conducted by Outlook. In September 2014, India and the United States launched the Fulbright-Kalam climate fellowship which enabled six Indian doctoral students and researchers to work with institutions in the US for a period of 6\u201312 months. In 2015, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that Kalam's birthday, 15 October, would be observed as \"Youth Renaissance Day\". It also instituted the \"Dr. A.\u00a0P.\u00a0J. Abdul Kalam Award\" constituting a gold medal, a certificate and (), to be awarded annually on the Indian Independence Day, to residents of the state with achievements in promoting scientific growth, the humanities or the welfare of students. On the anniversary of Kalam's birth in 2015, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) released topics on his name as a part of the CBSE expression series. On the same day, India Post released postage stamps commemorating the 84th anniversary of Kalam's birth.\nIn 2017, researchers at the NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory discovered a new bacterium on the filters of the International Space Station and named it \"Solibacillus kalamii\" to honour Kalam. In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as \"Drypetes kalamii\", in his honour. In 2022, a newly discovered species of footballfish was named as \"Himantolophus kalami\" in Kalam's honour. In 2023, a newly discovered tardigrade was named \"Batillipes kalami\" after him.\nSeveral places and locations have been named after Kalam. In August 2015, Aurangzeb Road in New Delhi was named after Kalam as Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road. In September 2015, the national missile test site in Odisha in Wheeler Island was renamed as Abdul Kalam Island. In October 2015, a peak near the Bara Shigri Glacier in the Himalayas was named as Mount Kalam. Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Missile Complex, a missile research facility in Hyderabad is named after him. Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam Science City in Patna, and Dr. Abdul Kalam Science Centre and Planetarium in Puducherry are named in honour of Kalam. Several universities, and other educational institutions and other locations were renamed or named in honour of Kalam.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 2008, a documentary film \"A Little Dream\" directed by P. Dhanapal was released in India. In the 2011 Hindi film \"I Am Kalam\", Kalam is portrayed as a positive influence on a poor but bright Rajasthani boy named Chhotu, who renames himself Kalam in honour of his idol. \"People's President\" is a 2016 Indian documentary feature film directed by Pankaj Vyas and produced by the Government of India's Films Division. \"My Hero Kalam\" is a 2018 Kannada biographical film by Shivu Hiremath which portrays Kalam's life from childhood to the Pokhran tests. The third episode of \"Mega Icons\" (2018\u20132020), a documentary television series about prominent personalities of India aired on National Geographic was based on Kalam's life. In the 2020 Tamil film \"Soorarai Pottru\", Sheik Maideen portrayed Kalam. In \"Rocket Boys\", a Hindi biographical streaming television series on SonyLIV, the character of Kalam was played by Arjun Radhakrishnan. In the 2022 Tamil film \"\", Kalam is portrayed by Amaan.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Tech, or simply Tech) is a public research university in Ruston, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the University of Louisiana System and classified among \"R2: Doctoral Universities \u2013 High research activity\".\nLouisiana Tech opened as the Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana in 1894 during the Second Industrial Revolution. The original mission of the college was for the education of students in the arts and sciences for the purpose of developing an industrial economy in post-Reconstruction Louisiana. Four years later in 1898, the state constitution changed the school's name to Louisiana Industrial Institute. In 1921, the college changed its name to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute to reflect its development as a larger institute of technology. Louisiana Polytechnic Institute became desegregated in the 1960s. It officially changed its name to Louisiana Tech University in 1970 as it satisfied criteria of a research university.\nLouisiana Tech enrolled 12,463 students in five academic colleges during the Fall 2018 academic quarter including 1,282 students in the graduate school. In addition to the main campus in Ruston, Louisiana Tech holds classes at the Louisiana Tech University Shreveport Center, Academic Success Center in Bossier City, Barksdale Air Force Base Instructional Site, and on the CenturyLink campus in Monroe.\nLouisiana Tech fields 16 varsity NCAA Division I sports teams (7 men's, 9 women's teams) and is a member of Conference USA (future Sunbelt Conference member) of the Football Bowl Subdivision. The university is known for its Bulldogs football team and Lady Techsters women's basketball program which won three national championship titles (1981, 1982, 1988) and made 13 Final Four appearances in the program's history.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nRuston College, a forerunner to Louisiana Tech, was established in the middle 1880s by W. C. Friley, a Southern Baptist pastor. This institution lasted for seven years and had annual enrollments of about 250 students. Friley subsequently from 1892 to 1894 served as the first president of Hardin\u2013Simmons University in Abilene, Texas, and from 1909 to 1910, as the second president of Louisiana College in Pineville.\nOn May 14, 1894, the Lincoln Parish Police Jury held a special session to outline plans to secure a regional industrial school. The police jury (a body similar to a county court or county commission in other states) called upon State Representative George M. Lomax to introduce the proposed legislation during the upcoming session. Representative Lomax, Jackson Parish Representative J. T. M. Hancock, and journalist, lawyer, and future judge John B. Holstead fought for the passage of the bill. On July 6, 1894, the proposed bill was approved as Act No. 68 of the General Assembly of Louisiana. The act established \"The Industrial Institute and College of Louisiana\", an industrial institute created for the education of white children in the arts and sciences.\nIn 1894, Colonel Arthur T. Prescott was elected as the first president of the college. He moved to Ruston and began overseeing the construction of a two-story main building. The brick building housed eight large classrooms, an auditorium, a chemical laboratory, and two offices. A frame building was also built nearby and was used for the instruction of mechanics. The main building was located on a plot of that was donated to the school by Francis P. Stubbs. On September 23, 1895, the school started its first session with six faculty members and 202 students.\nIn May 1897, Harry Howard became the first graduate. Colonel Prescott awarded him with a Bachelor of Industry degree, but there was no formal commencement. The first formal commencement was held in the Ruston Opera House the following May with ten graduates receiving their diplomas.\nArticle 256 of the 1898 state constitution changed the school's name to Louisiana Industrial Institute. Two years later, the course of study was reorganized into two years of preparatory work and three years of college level courses. Students who were high school graduates were admitted to the seventh quarter (college level) of study without examination. As years went by, courses changed and admissions requirements tightened. From 1917 to 1925, several curricula were organized according to the junior college standards and were offered leading to the Bachelor of Industry degree. In 1919, the Board of Trustees enlarged the curricula and started granting a standard baccalaureate degree. The first of these was granted on June 15, 1921, a Bachelor of Science in Engineering.\nThe Constitution adopted June 18, 1921, changed the name of the school in Article XII, Section 9, from Louisiana Industrial Institute to Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, or \"Louisiana Tech\" for short.\nExpansion.\nThe Main Building, also known as Old Main, burned to the ground in December 1936, but the columns that marked the entrance remain in place behind Prescott Memorial Library. By June 1936, construction on a new administration building had begun. On completion in January 1937, it was named Leche Hall in honor of then Governor Richard W. Leche of New Orleans. The building was renamed after the death of former university president, J. E. Keeny, and remains the remodeled Keeny Hall.\nLouisiana Polytechnic Institute experienced an infrastructure growth spurt in 1939 and 1940. Seven buildings were designed by architect Edward F. Neild and completed at a cost of $2,054,270. These were Aswell Hall (girls' dormitory), Robinson Hall (men's dormitory for juniors and seniors), Tolliver Hall (880-seat dining hall), Bogard Hall (the Engineering Building), the S.J. Wages Power Plant, Reese Agricultural Hall (located on the South Campus Tech Farm), and the Howard Auditorium &amp; Fine Arts Building.\nDuring World War II, Louisiana Polytechnic Institute was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.\nAfter World War II, old army barracks were used to construct the student union and bookstore. It was known as the \"Tonk\" because it resembled a honky tonk. The building was replaced 15 years later but its nickname remained.\nIn 1959, four students were awarded the first master's degrees by the institution.\nUniversity era.\nIn 1962, Foster Jay Taylor became the 12th President of the Louisiana Polytechnic Institute, having succeeded Ralph L. Ropp. During his twenty-five years at president, Dr. Taylor oversaw the transformation of the former Louisiana Polytechnic Institute into Louisiana Tech University. The university's enrollment grew from about 3,000 students in 1962 to roughly 12,000 students in 1987. The first African-American students at Louisiana Tech, James Earl Potts (a transfer student from the nearby HBCU Grambling State University) and Bertha Bradford-Robinson, were admitted in the spring of 1965.\nMost of the modern buildings on the Main Campus were either built or renovated during Taylor's tenure as university president. The main athletic facilities were constructed during the Taylor Era including Joe Aillet Stadium, the Thomas Assembly Center, J.C. Love Field, and the Lady Techster Softball Complex. In addition to the athletic facilities, the 16-story Wyly Tower, Student Bookstore, Nethken Hall (Electrical Engineering building), the University President's House, and the current College of Business Building were built on the Main Campus. In order to house the increasing student body of Louisiana Tech, Dr. Taylor led the construction of Graham, Harper, Kidd, Caruthers, and Neilson residence halls.\nTaylor's time as Louisiana Tech president also marked the beginning of Lady Techster athletics. In 1974, Taylor established the Lady Techsters women's basketball program with a $5,000 appropriation. He hired Sonja Hogg, a 28-year-old PE instructor at Ruston High School, as the Lady Techsters' first head coach.

The Lady of the Mist symbolizes \"Alma Mater\" welcoming new students and bidding farewell to Tech graduates. The statue also symbolizes the hope that Louisiana Tech graduates will fulfill their ambitions and highest callings in life.\nThe statue and fountain was funded in 1938 by the Women's Panhellenic Association of Ruston, the governing body of the university's sorority groups. The Lady of the Mist was the idea of Art &amp; Architecture faculty member Mary Moffett and Art Department Chair Elizabeth Bethea. The Lady of the Mist was created by Duncan Ferguson and Jules Struppeck and specifically located in the middle of the Quad facing north toward the old north entrance columns of the Tech campus. This was done to welcome everyone to the campus as people looked through the north entrance columns to see the statue's open arms waiting to greet them.\nThe Lady fell into disrepair in the years after its construction. In 1985, the statue was restored through the efforts of the Student Government Association, Panhellenic, Residence Hall Association, and Association of Women Students. Today, the statue remains a focal point for students and alumni who return to the Tech campus. Incoming freshman commemorate their new beginning by tossing a gold medallion into the fountain.\nAlumni brick walkway.\nThe alumni walkway was constructed in 1995 as part of the centennial celebration at Louisiana Tech. The brick path stretches from the corner of Adams Boulevard and Dan Reneau Drive through the heart of Centennial Plaza to the footsteps of Tolliver Hall. The alumni brick walkway then follows Wisteria Street north toward Railroad Avenue. The plan is to extend the alumni brick walkway through the University Park student housing apartments that were built near J.C. Love Field. As of March 2022, they have laid down the Bricks of 2020 Alumni.\nNotable people.\nLouisiana Tech has produced prominent business people across several industries. Louisiana Tech alumnus Nick Akins is currently serving as chief executive officer of Fortune 500 company American Electric Power. Alumnus Glen Post is the former CEO of CenturyLink, and alumnus Michael McCallister is the former CEO of Humana. Edward L.

Wallis as executive producer. The screenplay was adapted by Casey Robinson from the 1938 novel by Rachel Field. The music was by Max Steiner and the cinematography by Ernie Haller. The film stars Bette Davis and Charles Boyer with Jeffrey Lynn, Barbara O'Neil, Virginia Weidler, Helen Westley, Walter Hampden, Henry Daniell, Harry Davenport, George Coulouris and Montagu Love.\nField's novel is based on the true story of her great-aunt Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, a French governess who fell in love with the Duc de Praslin, her employer. When Praslin's wife was murdered, Deluzy-Desportes was implicated. The scandal contributed to the political turmoil before the French Revolution of 1848 that deposed King Louis Philippe I.\nPlot.\nMademoiselle Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, a French woman, starts teaching at an American girls school. She is confronted by the tales and gossip about her that circulate among her pupils and, thus provoked, she decides to tell them her life story.\nDeluzy-Desportes is governess to the four children of the Duc and Duchesse de Praslin in Paris during the last years of the Orleans monarchy. As a result of the Duchesse's constantly erratic and temperamental behavior, all that remains is an unhappy marriage, but the Duc remains with his wife for the sake of their children.\nDeluzy-Desportes, with her warmth and kindness, wins the love and affection of the children and their father, but also the jealousy and hatred of their mother. She is forced to leave and the Duchess refuses to give her a letter of recommendation to future employers. The Duc confronts his wife and she invents alternative letters taking opposite attitudes, which in fact she has not written and does not intend to write. Her account enrages him and, at the breaking point, he kills her.\nThe Duc de Praslin is in a privileged position; as a peer his case can only be heard by other nobles. He refuses to confess his guilt or openly to admit his love for his employee, knowing that his fellow nobles wish to use such an admission to blame her for the murder by declaring that he was acting at her bidding. Ultimately the Duc takes poison to prevent himself from ever publicly proclaiming his love for Henriette, since he knows that would convict her; however, he lives long enough to reveal it to another of his servants, Pierre, a kindly old man who had warned the governess to leave the de Praslin household. With the Duc's death, the authorities accept that they have no evidence upon which to base a judgment that Henriette solicited the murder and she is released from the Conciergerie.\nDeluzy-Desportes had been recommended for the teaching position \"in the land of the free\" by an American minister, Rev. Henry Field, to whom she had expressed a loss of faith while in prison. He proposes marriage, and it is implied that Henriette will accept.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;*Bette Davis as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes\nReception.\nThe film was positively reviewed by critics. When the film premiered at Radio City Music Hall, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" wrote that filmgoers willing to sit through the long running time \"will find the film a source of much emotional satisfaction; others of less Spartan stamp will certainly protest that it wears out their patience in the telling of a comparatively uncomplicated tale. For the Warners are here handing out a tear-laden old-fashioned drama\u2014and a very heavy one, too.\"\n\"Variety\" called it \"film theatre at its best...Casey Robinson in the scripting captured the quaintness of the manners and customs of Paris, in 1848, and succeeded admirably in retaining both spirit and characters of the novel, despite the necessity for much deletion of material.\" \"Film Daily\"'s headline announced: \"Dramatically powerful, beautifully mounted and superbly cast; film should be one of year's strongest box-office attractions.\" \"Harrison's Reports\" wrote: \"A powerful drama, with a strong appeal for women. The production is lavish, and the direction and performances are of the highest order.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote that Litvak had swung the viewer into the historical setting \"with all the romantic, profuse gusto at his command. I think a few of the scenes of governess and children might have been elided, for, with the sinister doings in the background, we can't forever sustain a nursery mood. In general, though, the long picture seems short, which, of course, is something very much in its favor.\"\nThe film was placed fifth on \"Film Daily\"'s year-end nationwide poll of 546 critics naming the best films of 1940. It is considered to be a successful but expensive costume drama.\nHome media.\nOn April 1, 2008, Warner Home Video released the film as part of the box set \"The Bette Davis Collection, Volume 3\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It tells the story of an American reporter based in Britain who tries to expose enemy spies involved in a fictional continent-wide conspiracy in the prelude to World War II. It stars Joel McCrea and features 19-year-old Laraine Day, Herbert Marshall, George Sanders, Albert Bassermann, and Robert Benchley, along with Edmund Gwenn.\n\"Foreign Correspondent\" was Hitchcock's second Hollywood production after leaving the United Kingdom in 1939 (the first was \"Rebecca\") and had an unusually large number of writers: Robert Benchley, Charles Bennett, Harold Clurman, Joan Harrison, Ben Hecht, James Hilton, John Howard Lawson, John Lee Mahin, Richard Maibaum, and Budd Schulberg, with Bennett, Harrison, Hilton and Benchley the only writers credited in the finished film. It was based on Vincent Sheean's political memoir \"Personal History\" (1935), the rights to which were purchased by producer Walter Wanger for $10,000.\nThe film was one of two Hitchcock films nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1940, the other being \"Rebecca\", which went on to win the award. \"Foreign Correspondent\" was nominated for six Academy Awards, including one for Albert Bassermann for Best Supporting Actor, but did not win any.&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlot.\nIn mid-August 1939, just before the outbreak of World WarII, the editor of the \"New York Morning Globe\", Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport), sends crime reporter John Jones, using the pen name \"Huntley Haverstock\" (Joel McCrea), to Europe to report on conditions there. Jones's first assignment is to interview a Dutch diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Bassermann), at a luncheon.\nJones/Haverstock shares a cab with Van Meer on the way to the luncheon. He peppers him with questions about the impending war, but Van Meer evades answering. Once at the event, Jones becomes smitten with Carol (Laraine Day) who has some uncertain role at the meeting. He invites her to sit at his table saying none of the reporters will listen to the speeches. A charming host, Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), the leader of the Universal Peace Party, makes the announcement that their keynote speaker, Van Meer, has taken ill and won't appear. In his stead, the host has his daughter, Carol, speak. Jones realizes he has inadvertently insulted the woman he now adores.\nThe newspaper editor, Powers, sends Jones on to Amsterdam to cover Van Meer's next appearance, at a conference of the Universal Peace Party. When Jones stops to greet Van Meer outside the conference hall, Van Meer seems to be in some kind of hypnotic state and does not recognize him. Suddenly, an eager photographer moves to take a photo of the Dutch diplomat \u2013 actually concealing a gun near the camera. He assassinates Van Meer. Jones runs after the shooter and ends up encountering Carol and a reporter friend of hers, Scott ffolliott (George Sanders). They give chase in his car. Outside the city, they seem to lose sight of the car they have been following, but Jones suspects that the assassin is hiding in a windmill.\nWhile Carol and ffolliott go for the police, Jones searches the windmill and finds Van Meer alive, but heavily drugged. All Van Meer can manage to convey is that the man shot in front of witnesses earlier was an imposter. Jones narrowly escapes the windmill to tell the police that Van Meer is alive. When they all return to the scene with authorities, Van Meer and his kidnappers are gone. Later, back at Jones's hotel room in Amsterdam, two spies posing as police officers arrive to kidnap him. When he suspects who they really are, he escapes out of his hotel bathroom window. He runs into Carol again.\nJones and Carol board a British ship to England. Amidst a furious storm, Jones proposes marriage to her, which she accepts. In England, they go to Carol's father's house, where Jones sees Krug (Eduardo Ciannelli), whom he recognizes from the windmill as the operative running the assassination and kidnapping. Fisher and Krug realize Jones knows too much, and Krug convinces Fisher that he must be killed. Fisher tells Jones he is in danger and offers a bodyguard to protect him. The bodyguard, Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), takes Jones to the top of Westminster Cathedral tower ostensibly to ditch anyone following them and to show Jones the view. Suddenly, the bodyguard tries to shove Jones off the tower, going over the side to his own death, instead.\nJones and ffolliott are convinced that Fisher is a traitor, so they come up with a plan: Jones will take Carol to Cambridge, and ffolliott will pretend she has been kidnapped, in order to force Fisher to divulge Van Meer's location. Carol agrees to go, thinking that the purpose of their trip is to protect Jones by getting him out of London. When she overhears Jones booking two adjoining rooms at an inn, she believes that Jones has tricked her into leaving London for a premarital sexual encounter. She returns home alone and earlier than ffolliott expected, foiling his attempt to extract Van Meer's location from her father. ffolliott then trails Fisher to a closed hotel where Van Meer is being held prisoner. He is captured at gunpoint and brought into the room where the spy ring is holding a drugged Van Meer, torturing him with bright lights and loud jazz music. Fisher fails to persuade Van Meer to reveal the details of a secret clause in a treaty, Clause 27 (the movie's MacGuffin). Fisher then has Van Meer physically tortured until he begins to recite the clause, which would be triggered if Germany goes to war. ffolliot starts to fight Fisher's thugs to interrupt Van Meer, and then escapes. Jones and a fellow reporter arrive, and the three rescue Van Meer. Fisher flees. Van Meer is taken to a nearby hospital, where he slowly regains consciousness.\nBritain and France declare war on Germany. Jones and ffolliott follow the Fishers onto a Short S.30 Empire flying boat to America. When Fisher intercepts a telegram intended for ffolliott, telling him that Van Meer has recovered and identified Fisher as his kidnapper, Fisher realizes he will soon be captured and returned to England. He confesses his treasonous behavior to Carol, who already suspects the truth but promises to stand by him. Jones pleads with Carol to rekindle their affair. Seconds later, the aircraft is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean. The survivors perch on the floating wing of the downed aircraft. Realizing that the wing cannot support everyone, Fisher slips into the ocean to drown, dying for his cause while also sacrificing himself so the rest will survive.\nAn American ship rescues the survivors. The captain refuses to allow the reporters to file their stories using the ship's communications, citing American neutrality in the war. Still, Jones, ffolliott, and Carol surreptitiously communicate the story by radio-telephone to Mr. Powers. Jones returns to England and, with Carol at his side, becomes a successful war correspondent. During a live radio broadcast, he describes London being bombed, urging Americans to \"keep those lights burning\" as they go dark in the studio.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAlfred Hitchcock can be seen when Joel McCrea first spots Van Meer on the street in London; Hitchcock walks past reading a newspaper. Albert Bassermann, who plays Van Meer, was German and did not speak English, so he had to learn all his lines phonetically. Likewise, one supposedly Dutch girl in the film speaks Dutch phonetically, though less convincingly.\nProduction.\nProducer Walter Wanger bought the rights to journalist Vincent Sheean's memoir \"Personal History\" in 1935, but after several adaptations proved unsatisfactory, Wanger allowed the story to stray significantly from the book. It took numerous writers and five years before Wanger had a script he was satisfied with, by which time Hitchcock was in the United States under contract with David O. Selznick and available to direct this film on a loan-out. Hitchcock, who did not enjoy working under the usual close scrutiny of Selznick, originally wanted Gary Cooper and Joan Fontaine for the lead roles, but Cooper was not interested in doing a thriller at the time, and Selznick would not loan out Fontaine. Later, Cooper admitted to Hitchcock that he had made a mistake in turning down the film.\nWorking titles for the film, which began production on March 18, 1940, and initially finished on June 5, were \"Personal History\" and \"Imposter\". Shooting took place at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio in West Hollywood, and on location around Los Angeles and Long Beach.\nAfter the film wrapped, Hitchcock visited his native England, and returned to Los Angeles on July 3, to report that the Germans were expected to begin bombing London at any time. To accommodate this, Ben Hecht was called in to write the epilogue of the film, the scene in the radio station, which replaced the original end sequence in which two of the characters discussed the events of the film on a transatlantic seaplane trip. The new ending was filmed on July 5, presciently foreshadowing the celebrated radio broadcasts of Edward R. Murrow.\nAlthough many critics and film historians claim that neither Germany nor Hitler is named specifically in the film, both the man and the nation are indeed mentioned, including a scene where the name Germany is spelled out in the headline of a newspaper being hawked in the street and, while being given his assignment, Joel McCrea suggests an interview with Hitler, to get his views on the possibility of war. A fictional nation is mentioned numerous times however, possibly indicating that it was briefly considered as a potential proxy aggressor European country rather than an actual Axis nation.\nOne of the sequences in the film that continues to have a strong effect on viewers is the William Cameron Menzies-designed mid-ocean crash of the flying boat after it is shot down by a German destroyer. In 1972, in an interview with Dick Cavett, Hitchcock discussed some details of how the scene was created. Footage taken from a stunt aircraft diving over the ocean was rear-projected on rice paper in front of the cockpit set, while behind the rice paper were two chutes connected to large water tanks. The chutes were aimed at the windshield of the cockpit so that water would break through the rice paper at the right moment, simulating the crash of the aircraft into the ocean. However, during the crash sequence, studio lights can briefly be seen.\nHitchcock's eccentric marriage proposal to his wife Alma was written for this film, for the scene when Jones proposes to Carol.\nReception.\n\"Foreign Correspondent\" opened on August 16, 1940, in the United States and on October 11 of that year in the United Kingdom. The film, which ends with London being bombed, opened in the United States at the dawn of the Battle of Britain, just three days after the Luftwaffe began bombing British coastal airfields in the early \"Adlerangriff\" phase of the Battle of Britain, and a week before Germany began bombing London on August 24.\nBox office.\n\"Foreign Correspondent\" did well at the box office, but its high cost meant it incurred a loss of $369,973. According to \"Kinematograph Weekly\" it was the second most popular film of 1940 in Britain (the first being \"Rebecca\"). It earned \u00a3118,519 in the UK.\nCritical.\nIt was generally praised by the critics, although some saw it as a glorified B movie. It also attracted attention from at least one professional propagandist, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, who called \"Foreign Correspondent\" \"a masterpiece of propaganda, a first-class production which no doubt will make a certain impression upon the broad masses of the people in enemy countries\".\nOn the review aggregator website\u00a0Rotten Tomatoes,\u00a0\"Foreign Correspondent\"\u00a0has an approval rating of 96% based on 45 reviews, with an average score of 8.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Alfred Hitchcock's \"Foreign Correspondent\" features a winning combination of international intrigue, comic relief, and some of the legendary director's most memorable set pieces.\" On Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating to reviews, the film has a score of 89 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In his 2012 review, Saptarshi Ray of \"The Guardian\" wrote of \"Foreign Correspondent\": \"a breathless yarn with the most serious of intents that soars well beyond mediocrity but just below genius, yet remains a film that should be included on the master of suspense's top table.\"\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1941, \"Foreign Correspondent\" was nominated for six Academy Awards, but did not win any.\n\"Foreign Correspondent\" was named one of the 10 Best Films of 1940 by \"Film Daily\".\nAdaptations.\n\"Foreign Correspondent\" was adapted to the radio program \"Academy Award Theater\" on July 24, 1946, with Joseph Cotten starring.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Having been the only major Hollywood filmmaker to continue to make silent films well into the period of sound films, Chaplin made this his first true sound film.\nChaplin's film advanced a stirring condemnation of the German and Italian dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini, as well as fascism, antisemitism, and Nazism. At the time of its first release, the United States was still at peace with Nazi Germany and neutral during what were the early days of World War II. Chaplin plays both leading roles: a ruthless fascist dictator and a persecuted Jewish barber.\n\"The Great Dictator\" was popular with audiences, becoming Chaplin's most commercially successful film. Modern critics have praised it as a historically significant film, one of the greatest comedy films ever made and an important work of satire. In 1997, it was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". \"The Great Dictator\" was nominated for five Academy Awards\u2014Outstanding Production, Best Actor, Best Writing (Original Screenplay), Best Supporting Actor for Jack Oakie, and Best Music (Original Score).\nIn his 1964 autobiography, Chaplin stated that he could not have made the film had he known about the true extent of the Holocaust at that time.\nPlot.\nOn the Western Front in 1918, a Jewish soldier fighting for the Central Powers nation of Tomainia valiantly saves the life of a wounded pilot, Commander Schultz, who carries valuable documents that could secure a Tomainian victory. However, after running out of fuel, their plane crashes into a tree and the soldier subsequently suffers memory loss. Upon being rescued, Schultz is informed that Tomainia has officially surrendered to the Allied Forces, while the Jewish soldier is carried off to a hospital.\nTwenty years later, still suffering from amnesia, the Jewish soldier returns to his previous profession as a barber in a ghetto. The ghetto is now governed by Schultz who has been promoted in the Tomainian regime, now transformed into a dictatorship under the ruthless Adenoid Hynkel. The barber falls in love with a neighbor, Hannah, and together they try to resist persecution by military forces. The stormtroopers capture the barber and are about to kill him, but Schultz recognizes him and restrains them. By recognizing him, and reminding him of World War I, Schultz helps the barber regain his memory.\nMeanwhile, Hynkel tries to finance his ever-growing military forces by borrowing money from a Jewish banker called Hermann Epstein, leading to a temporary ease on the restrictions on the ghetto. However, ultimately the banker refuses to lend him the money. Furious, Hynkel orders a purge of the Jews. Schultz protests against this inhumane policy and is sent to a concentration camp. He escapes and hides in the ghetto with the barber. Schultz tries to persuade the Jewish family to assassinate Hynkel in a suicide attack, but they are dissuaded by Hannah. Troops search the ghetto, arrest Schultz and the barber, and send both to a concentration camp. Hannah and her family flee to freedom at a vineyard in the neighboring country of Osterlich.\nHynkel has a dispute with the dictator of the nation of Bacteria, Benzino Napaloni, over which country should invade Osterlich. The two dictators argue over a treaty to govern the invasion, while dining together at an elaborate buffet, which happens to provide a jar of English mustard. The quarrel becomes heated and descends into a food fight, which is only resolved when both men eat the hot mustard and are shocked into cooperating. After signing the treaty with Napaloni, Hynkel orders the invasion of Osterlich. Hannah and her family are trapped by the invading force and beaten by a squad of arriving soldiers.\nEscaping from the camp in stolen uniforms, Schultz and the barber, dressed as Hynkel, arrive at the Osterlich frontier, where a victory parade crowd is waiting to be addressed by Hynkel. The real Hynkel is mistaken for the barber while out duck hunting in civilian clothes and is knocked out and taken to the camp. Schultz tells the barber to go to the platform and impersonate Hynkel, as it is the only way to save their lives once they reach Osterlich's capital. He announces that he (as Hynkel) has had a change of heart and makes an impassioned speech for brotherhood and goodwill, encouraging soldiers to fight for liberty, and unite the people in the name of democracy.\nHe then addresses a message of hope to Hannah: \"Look up, Hannah. The soul of man has been given wings, and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow, into the light of hope, into the future, the glorious future that belongs to you, to me, and to all of us.\" Hannah hears the barber's voice on the radio. She turns toward the rising sunlight, and says to her fellows: \"Listen.\"\nCast.\nOther cast.\nAlso featuring Esther Michelson, Florence Wright, Eddie Gribbon, Robert O. Davis, Eddie Dunn, Nita Pike and Peter Lynn.\nProduction.\nAccording to J\u00fcrgen Trimborn's biography of Nazi propaganda filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl, both Chaplin and French filmmaker Ren\u00e9 Clair viewed Riefenstahl's \"Triumph of the Will\" together at a showing at the New York Museum of Modern Art. Filmmaker Luis Bu\u00f1uel reports that Clair was horrified by the power of the film, crying out that this should never be shown or the West was lost. Chaplin, on the other hand, laughed uproariously at the film. He used it to inspire many elements of \"The Great Dictator\", and, by repeatedly viewing this film, Chaplin could closely mimic Hitler's mannerisms.\nTrimborn suggests that Chaplin decided to proceed with making \"The Great Dictator\" after viewing Riefenstahl's film. Hynkel's rally speech near the beginning of the film, delivered in German-sounding gibberish, is a caricature of Hitler's oratory style, which Chaplin also studied carefully in newsreels.\nThe film was directed by Chaplin (with his half-brother Wheeler Dryden as assistant director), and written and produced by Chaplin. The film was shot largely at the Charlie Chaplin Studios and other locations around Los Angeles. The elaborate World War I scenes were filmed in Laurel Canyon. Chaplin and Meredith Willson composed the music.\nChaplin wanted to address the escalating violence and repression of Jews by the Nazis throughout the late 1930s, the magnitude of which was conveyed to him personally by his European Jewish friends and fellow artists. Nazi Germany's repressive nature and militarist tendencies were well known at the time. Ernst Lubitsch's 1942 \"To Be or Not To Be\" dealt with similar themes, and also used a mistaken-identity Hitler figure. But Chaplin later said that he would not have made the film had he known of the true extent of the Nazis' crimes. After the horror of the Holocaust became known, filmmakers struggled for nearly 20 years to find the right angle and tone to satirize the era.\nIn the period when Hitler and his Nazi Party rose to prominence, Chaplin was becoming internationally popular. He was mobbed by fans on a 1931 trip to Berlin, which annoyed the Nazis. Resenting his style of comedy, they published a book titled \"The Jews Are Looking at You\" (1934), describing the comedian as \"a disgusting Jewish acrobat\" (although Chaplin was not Jewish). Ivor Montagu, a close friend of Chaplin's, relates that he sent the comedian a copy of the book and always believed that Chaplin decided to retaliate with making \"Dictator\".\nIn the 1930s, cartoonists and comedians often built on Hitler and Chaplin having similar mustaches. Chaplin also capitalized on this resemblance in order to give his Little Tramp character a \"reprieve\".\nIn his memoir \"My Father, Charlie Chaplin\", Chaplin's son Charles Chaplin Jr. described his father as being haunted by the similarities in background between him and Hitler; they were born four days apart in April 1889, and both had risen to their present heights from poverty. He wrote:\nTheir destinies were poles apart. One was to make millions weep, while the other was to set the whole world laughing. Dad could never think of Hitler without a shudder, half of horror, half of fascination. \"Just think\", he would say uneasily, \"he's the madman, I'm the comic. But it could have been the other way around.\"\nChaplin prepared the story throughout 1938 and 1939, and began filming in September 1939, six days after the beginning of World War II. He finished filming almost six months later. The 2002 TV documentary on the making of the film, \"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;The Tramp and the Dictator\", presented newly discovered footage of the film production (shot by Chaplin's elder half-brother Sydney) that showed Chaplin's initial attempts at the film's ending, filmed before the fall of France.\nAccording to \"The Tramp and the Dictator\", Chaplin arranged to send the film to Hitler, and an eyewitness confirmed he saw it. Hitler's architect and friend Albert Speer denied that the leader had ever seen it. Hitler's response to the film is not recorded, but another account tells that he viewed the film twice.\nSome of the signs in the shop windows of the ghetto in the film are written in Esperanto, a language that Hitler condemned as an anti-nationalist Jewish plot to destroy German culture because it was an international language whose founder was a Polish Jew.\nMusic.\nThe film score was written and composed by Meredith Willson, later known as composer and librettist of the 1957 musical comedy \"The Music Man\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I've seen [Chaplin] take a soundtrack and cut it all up and paste it back together and come up with some of the dangdest effects you ever heard\u2014effects a composer would never think of. Don't kid yourself about that one. He would have been great at anything\u2014music, law, ballet dancing, or painting\u2014house, sign, or portrait. I got the screen credit for \"The Great Dictator\" music score, but the best parts of it were all Chaplin's ideas, like using the \"Lohengrin\" \"Prelude\" in the famous balloon-dance scene.\nAccording to Willson, the scene in which Chaplin shaves a customer to Brahms's \"Hungarian Dance\" No. 5 had been filmed before he arrived, using a phonograph record for timing. Willson's task was to re-record it with the full studio orchestra, fitting the music to the action. They had planned to do it painstakingly, recording eight measures or less at a time, after running through the whole scene to get the overall idea. Chaplin decided to record the run-through in case anything was usable. Willson later wrote, \"by dumb luck we had managed to catch every movement, and that was the first and only 'take' made of the scene, the one used in the finished picture\".\nJames L. Neibaur has noted that among the many parallels that Chaplin noted between his own life and Hitler's was an affinity for Wagner's music. Chaplin's appreciation for Wagner has been noted in studies of the director's use of film music. Many commentators have noted Chaplin's use of Wagner's \"Lohengrin\" prelude when Hynkel dances with the globe-balloon. Chaplin repeated the use of the \"Lohengrin\" prelude near the conclusion when the exiled Hannah listens to the Jewish barber's speech celebrating democracy and freedom. The music is interrupted during the dictator's dance but it is heard to climax and completion in the barber's pro-democracy speech.\nCommenting on this, Lutz Peter Koepnick writes in 2002,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;How can Wagner at once help emphasize a progressivist vision of human individualism and a fascist preview of absolute domination? How can the master's music simultaneously signify a desire for lost emotional integrity and for authoritative grandeur?\nChaplin's dual use of \"Lohengrin\" points towards unsettling conjunctions of Nazi culture and Hollywood entertainment. Like Adorno, Chaplin understands Wagner as a signifier of both: the birth of fascism out of the spirit of the total work of art and the origin of mass culture out of the spirit of the most arduous aesthetic program of the 19th century. Unlike Adorno [who identifies American mass culture and fascist spectacle], Chaplin wants his audience to make crucial distinctions between competing Wagnerianisms. Both...rely on the driving force of utopian desires, on...the promise of self-transcendence and authentic collectivity, but they channel these mythic longings in fundamentally different directions. Although [Chaplin] exposes the puzzling modernity of Nazi politics, Chaplin is unwilling to write off either Wagner or industrial culture. [Chaplin suggests] Hollywood needs Wagner as never before in order to at once condemn the use of fantasy in fascism and warrant the utopian possibilities in industrial culture.\nReception.\nChaplin's film was released nine months after Hollywood's first parody of Hitler, the short subject \"You Nazty Spy!\" by the Three Stooges, which premiered in January 1940. Chaplin had been planning his feature-length work for years, and began filming in September 1939. Hitler had been previously allegorically pilloried in the 1933 German film \"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\", by Fritz Lang.\nThe film was well received in the United States at the time of its release and was popular with the American public. For example, Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"a truly superb accomplishment by a truly great artist\" and \"perhaps the most significant film ever produced.\" The film was also popular in the United Kingdom, drawing 9 million to the cinemas, despite Chaplin's fears that wartime audiences would dislike a comedy about a dictator. The film earned theater rentals of $3.5 million from the U.S. and Canada and $5 million in total worldwide rentals.\nThe film was banned in several Latin American countries, where there were active movements of Nazi sympathizers.\nDuring the film's production, the National Government of Neville Chamberlain had announced that it would prohibit its showing in the UK in keeping with its policy of appeasement towards Germany. By the time the film was released, however, Britain was at war with Germany and the film was welcomed in part for its obvious propaganda value. In 1941, London's Prince of Wales Theatre screened its UK premiere. The film had been banned in many parts of Europe, and the theatre's owner, Alfred Esdaile, was apparently fined for showing it.\nWhen the film was released in France in 1945, it became the most popular film of the year, with admissions of 8,360,048. The film was voted at No. 24 on the list of \"100 Greatest Films\" by the prominent French magazine \"Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma\" in 2008. In 2010, \"The Guardian\" considered it the 22nd-best comedy film of all time. The film was voted at No. 16 on the list of \"The 100 greatest comedies of all time\" by a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017.\nChaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance concludes his lengthy examination of the film, in his book \"Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema\", by asserting the film's importance among the great film satires. Vance writes, \"Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" survives as a masterful integration of comedy, politics and satire. It stands as Chaplin's most self-consciously political work and the cinema's first important satire.\"\nVance further reports that a refugee from Germany who had worked in the film division of the Nazi Ministry of Culture before deciding to flee told Chaplin that Hitler had watched the movie twice, entirely alone both times. Chaplin replied that he would \"... give anything to know what he thought of it.\"\nChaplin's Tramp character and the Jewish barber.\nThere is no critical consensus on the relationship between Chaplin's earlier Tramp character and the film's Jewish barber, but the trend is to view the barber as a variation on the theme. French film director Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut later noted that early in the production, Chaplin said he would not play The Tramp in a sound film. Turner Classic Movies says that years later, Chaplin acknowledged a connection between The Tramp and the barber. Specifically, \"There is some debate as to whether the unnamed Jewish barber is intended as the Tramp's final incarnation. Although in his autobiography he refers to the barber as the Little Tramp, Chaplin said in 1937 that he would not play the Little Tramp in his sound pictures.\"\nIn \"My Autobiography\", Chaplin wrote, \"Of course! As Hitler I could harangue the crowds all I wished. And as the tramp, I could remain more or less silent.\" \"The New York Times\", in its original review (16 October 1940), specifically sees him as the tramp. However, in the majority of his so-called tramp films, he was not literally playing a tramp. In his review of the film years after its release, Roger Ebert says, \"Chaplin was technically not playing the Tramp.\" He also writes, \"He [Chaplin] put the Little Tramp and $1.5 million of his own money on the line to ridicule Hitler.\"\nCritics who view the barber as different include Stephen Weissman, whose book \"Chaplin: A Life\" speaks of Chaplin \"abandoning traditional pantomime technique and his little tramp character\". DVD reviewer Mark Bourne asserts Chaplin's stated position: \"Granted, the barber bears more than a passing resemblance to the Tramp, even affecting the familiar bowler hat and cane. But Chaplin was clear that the barber is not the Tramp and \"The Great Dictator\" is not a Tramp movie.\" \"The Scarecrow Movie Guide\" also views the barber as different.\nAnnette Insdorf, in her book \"Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust\" (2003), writes that \"There was something curiously appropriate about the little tramp impersonating the dictator, for by 1939 Hitler and Chaplin were perhaps the two most famous men in the world. The tyrant and the tramp reverse roles in \"The Great Dictator\", permitting the eternal outsider to address the masses\". In \"The 50 Greatest Jewish Movies\" (1998), Kathryn Bernheimer writes, \"What he chose to say in \"The Great Dictator\", however, was just what one might expect from the Little Tramp. Film scholars have often noted that the Little Tramp resembles a Jewish stock figure, the ostracized outcast, an outsider.\"\nSeveral reviewers of the late 20th century describe the Little Tramp as developing into the Jewish barber. In \"Boom and Bust: American Cinema in the 1940s\", Thomas Schatz writes of \"Chaplin's Little Tramp transposed into a meek Jewish barber\", while, in \"Hollywood in Crisis: Cinema and American Society, 1929\u20131939\", Colin Shindler writes, \"The universal Little Tramp is transmuted into a specifically Jewish barber whose country is about to be absorbed into the totalitarian empire of Adenoid Hynkel.\" Finally, in \"A Distant Technology: Science Fiction Film and the Machine Age\", J. P. Telotte writes that \"The little tramp figure is here reincarnated as the Jewish barber\".\nA two-page discussion of the relationship between the barber and The Tramp appears in Eric L. Flom's book \"Chaplin in the Sound Era: An Analysis of the Seven Talkies.\" He concludes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Perhaps the distinction between the two characters would be more clear if Chaplin hadn't relied on some element of confusion to attract audiences to the picture. With \"The Great Dictator\"'s twist of mistaken identity, the similarity between the barber and the Tramp allowed Chaplin break [\"sic\"] with his old persona in the sense of characterization, but to capitalize on him in a visual sense. The similar nature of the Tramp and barber characterizations may have been an effort by Chaplin to maintain his popularity with filmgoers, many of whom by 1940 had never seen a silent picture during the silent era. Chaplin may have created a new character from the old, but he nonetheless counted on the Charlie person to bring audiences into the theaters for his first foray into sound, and his boldest political statement to date.\nAwards.\nThe film was nominated for five Academy Awards:\nChaplin also won best actor awards at National Board of Review awards and New York Film Critics Circle Awards.\nIn 1997, \"The Great Dictator\" was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".\nIn 2000, the American Film Institute ranked the film No. 37 in its \"100 Years... 100 Laughs\" list.\nThe February 2020 issue of \"New York Magazine\" lists \"The Great Dictator\" as among \"The Best Movies That Lost Best Picture at the Oscars.\"\nThe film holds a 92% \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews, with an average rating of 8.90/10. The consensus reads, \"Charlie Chaplin demonstrates that his comedic voice is undiminished by dialogue in this rousing satire of tyranny, which may be more distinguished by its uplifting humanism than its gags.\" Film critic Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four and included it in his Great Movies list.\nPlagiarism lawsuit.\nChaplin's half-brother Sydney directed and starred in a 1921 film called \"King, Queen, Joker\" in which, like Charles Chaplin, he played the dual role of a barber and ruler of a country which is about to be overthrown. More than twenty years later, in 1947, Charles Chaplin was sued over alleged plagiarism with \"The Great Dictator\". Konrad Bercovici claimed that he had created ideas such as Charles Chaplin playing a dictator and a dance with a globe, and that Charles Chaplin had discussed his five-page outline for a screenplay with him for several hours. Yet, apparently, neither the suing party nor Charles Chaplin himself brought up Sydney Chaplin's \"King, Queen, Joker\" of the silent era. The case, \"Bercovici v. Chaplin\", was settled, with Charles Chaplin paying Bercovici $95,000 &amp;lpar;&amp;dollar;\u00a0in &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;). In return, Bercovici conceded that Chaplin was the sole author. Chaplin insisted in his autobiography that he had been the sole writer of the movie's script. He agreed to a settlement, because of his \"unpopularity in the States at that moment and being under such court pressure, [he] was terrified, not knowing what to expect next.\"\nHome media.\nA digitally restored version of the film was released on DVD and Blu-ray by the Criterion Collection in May 2011. The extras feature color production footage shot by Sydney Chaplin, a deleted barbershop sequence from Charlie Chaplin's 1919 film \"Sunnyside\", a barbershop sequence from Sydney Chaplin's 1921 film \"King, Queen, Joker\", a visual essay by Chaplin biographer Jeffrey Vance titled \"The Clown Turns Prophet\", and \"The Tramp and the Dictator\" (2002), Kevin Brownlow and Michael Kloft's documentary exploring the lives of Chaplin and Hitler, including interviews with author Ray Bradbury, director Sidney Lumet, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, and others. It has a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Michael Wood, Chaplin's 1940 \"The New York Times\" defense of his movie, a reprint from critic Jean Narboni on the film's final speech, and Al Hirschfeld's original press book illustrations.\nLegacy.\n\"The Great Dictator\" influenced numerous directors, such as Stanley Kubrick, Mel Brooks, Wes Anderson, and Chuck Jones and inspired such films as \"The Dictator\" (2012), \"The Interview\" (2014), and \"Jojo Rabbit\" (2019).\nIn 2004, the British Film Institute (BFI) published a collection of essays on Chaplin and \"The Great Dictator\" in the book \"Chaplin: The Dictator and the Tramp\", edited by Frank Scheide and Hooman Mehran as part of the BFI's creation of the \"Chaplin research programme\". In 2005, the British Film institute in conjunction with the University of Southampton and the London College of Communication hosted \"The Charles Chaplin Conference\" in London to coincide with the institute's establishment of the \"Chaplin research programme\".\nSean McArdle and Jon Judy's Eisner Award-nominated comic book \"The F\u00fchrer and the Tramp\" is set during the production of \"The Great Dictator\".\nThe final speech of the film has been sampled in more than 40 songs, artists such as Coldplay and U2 have played the speech during live shows, and coffee company Lavazza used it in a television advertisement.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "62692", "revid": "2510232", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62692", "title": "Archean", "text": "Geologic eon, 4031\u20132500 million years ago\nThe Archean ( , also spelled Archaean or Arch\u00e6an), in older sources sometimes called the Archaeozoic, is the second of the four geologic eons of Earth's history, preceded by the Hadean Eon and followed by the Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic. The Archean represents the time period from https:// 2500 (million years ago). The Late Heavy Bombardment is hypothesized to overlap with the beginning of the Archean. The oldest known glaciation occurred in the middle of the eon.\nThe Earth during the Archean was mostly a water world: there was continental crust, but much of it was under an ocean deeper than today's oceans. Except for some rare relict crystals (Hadean zircon), today's oldest continental crust dates back to the Archean. Much of the geological detail of the Archean has been destroyed by subsequent tectonic activity. The Earth's atmosphere was also vastly different in composition from today's: the prebiotic atmosphere was a reducing atmosphere rich in methane and lacking free oxygen.\nThe earliest known life, mostly represented by shallow-water microbial mats called stromatolites, started in the Archean and remained simple prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) throughout the eon. The earliest photosynthetic processes, especially those by early cyanobacteria, appeared in the mid/late Archean and led to a permanent chemical change in the ocean and the atmosphere after the Archean.\nEtymology and changes in classification.\nThe word \"Archean\" is derived from the Greek word (), meaning 'beginning, origin'. The Pre-Cambrian had been believed to be without life (azoic); however, fossils were found in deposits that were judged to belong to the Azoic age. Before the Hadean Eon was recognized, the Archean spanned Earth's early history from its formation about 4,540\u00a0Ma until 2,500\u00a0Ma.\nInstead of being based on stratigraphy, the beginning and end of the Archean Eon are defined chronometrically. The eon's lower boundary or starting point of 4,031\u00b13\u00a0Ma is officially recognized by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, which is the age of the oldest known intact rock formations on Earth. Evidence of rocks from the preceding Hadean Eon are therefore restricted by definition to non-rock and non-terrestrial sources such as individual mineral grains and lunar samples.\nGeology.\nWhen the Archean began, the Earth's heat flow was nearly three times as high as it is today, and it was still twice the current level at the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic (2,500\u00a0&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Tooltip/styles.css\" /&gt;). The extra heat was partly remnant heat from planetary accretion, from the formation of the metallic core, and partly arose from the decay of radioactive elements. As a result, the Earth's mantle was significantly hotter than today.\nAlthough a few mineral grains have survived from the Hadean, the oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the Earth are Archean. Archean rocks are found in Greenland, Siberia, the Canadian Shield, Montana, Wyoming (exposed parts of the Wyoming Craton), Minnesota (Minnesota River Valley), the Baltic Shield, the Rhodope Massif, Scotland, India, Brazil, western Australia, and southern Africa. Granitic rocks predominate throughout the crystalline remnants of the surviving Archean crust. These include great melt sheets and voluminous plutonic masses of granite, diorite, layered intrusions, anorthosites and monzonites known as sanukitoids. Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphosed deep-water sediments, such as graywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments, and banded iron formations. Volcanic activity was considerably higher than today, with numerous lava eruptions, including unusual types such as komatiite. Carbonate rocks are rare, indicating that the oceans were more acidic, due to dissolved carbon dioxide, than during the Proterozoic. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations, consisting of alternating units of metamorphosed mafic igneous and sedimentary rocks, including Archean felsic volcanic rocks. The metamorphosed igneous rocks were derived from volcanic island arcs, while the metamorphosed sediments represent deep-sea sediments eroded from the neighboring island arcs and deposited in a forearc basin. Greenstone belts, which include both types of metamorphosed rock, represent sutures between the protocontinents.\nPlate tectonics likely started vigorously in the Hadean, but slowed down in the Archean. The slowing of plate tectonics was probably due to an increase in the viscosity of the mantle due to outgassing of its water. Plate tectonics likely produced large amounts of continental crust, but the deep oceans of the Archean probably covered the continents entirely. Only at the end of the Archean did the continents likely emerge from the ocean. The emergence of continents towards the end of the Archaean initiated continental weathering that left its mark on the oxygen isotope record by enriching seawater with isotopically light oxygen.\nDue to recycling and metamorphosis of the Archean crust, there is a lack of extensive geological evidence for specific continents. One hypothesis is that rocks that are now in India, western Australia, and southern Africa formed a continent called Ur as of 3,100\u00a0Ma. Another hypothesis, which conflicts with the first, is that rocks from western Australia and southern Africa were assembled in a continent called Vaalbara as far back as 3,600\u00a0Ma. Archean rock makes up only about 8% of Earth's present-day continental crust; the rest of the Archean continents have been recycled.\nBy the Neoarchean, plate tectonic activity may have been similar to that of the modern Earth, although there was a significantly greater occurrence of slab detachment resulting from a hotter mantle, rheologically weaker plates, and increased tensile stresses on subducting plates due to their crustal material metamorphosing from basalt into eclogite as they sank. There are well-preserved sedimentary basins, and evidence of volcanic arcs, intracontinental rifts, continent-continent collisions and widespread globe-spanning orogenic events suggesting the assembly and destruction of one and perhaps several supercontinents. Evidence from banded iron formations, chert beds, chemical sediments and pillow basalts demonstrates that liquid water was prevalent and deep oceanic basins already existed.\nAsteroid impacts were frequent in the early Archean. Evidence from spherule layers suggests that impacts continued into the later Archean, at an average rate of about one impactor with a diameter greater than every 15 million years. This is about the size of the Chicxulub impactor. These impacts would have been an important oxygen sink and would have caused drastic fluctuations of atmospheric oxygen levels.\nEnvironment.\nThe Archean atmosphere is thought to have almost completely lacked free oxygen; oxygen levels were less than 0.001% of their present atmospheric level, with some analyses suggesting they were as low as 0.00001% of modern levels. However, transient episodes of heightened oxygen concentrations are known from this eon around 2,980\u20132,960 Ma, 2,700 Ma, and 2,501 Ma. The pulses of increased oxygenation at 2,700 and 2,501 Ma have both been considered by some as potential start points of the Great Oxygenation Event, which most scholars consider to have begun in the Palaeoproterozoic (c.\u20092,400 Ma). Furthermore, oases of relatively high oxygen levels existed in some nearshore shallow marine settings by the Mesoarchean. The ocean was broadly reducing and lacked any persistent redoxcline, a water layer between oxygenated and anoxic layers with a strong redox gradient, which would become a feature in later, more oxic oceans. Despite the lack of free oxygen, the rate of organic carbon burial appears to have been roughly the same as in the present. Due to extremely low oxygen levels, sulphate was rare in the Archean ocean, and sulphides were produced primarily through reduction of organically sourced sulphite or through mineralisation of compounds containing reduced sulphur. The Archean ocean was enriched in heavier oxygen isotopes relative to the modern ocean, though \u03b418O values decreased to levels comparable to those of modern oceans over the course of the later part of the eon as a result of increased continental weathering.\nAstronomers think that the Sun had about 75\u201380\u00a0percent of its present luminosity, yet temperatures on Earth appear to have been near modern levels only 500\u00a0million years after Earth's formation (the faint young Sun paradox). The presence of liquid water is evidenced by certain highly deformed gneisses produced by metamorphism of sedimentary protoliths. The moderate temperatures may reflect the presence of greater amounts of greenhouse gases than later in the Earth's history. Extensive abiotic denitrification took place on the Archean Earth, pumping the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide into the atmosphere. Alternatively, Earth's albedo may have been lower at the time, due to less land area and cloud cover.\nEarly life.\nThe processes that gave rise to life on Earth are not completely understood, but there is substantial evidence that life came into existence either near the end of the Hadean Eon or early in the Archean Eon.\nThe earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite of biogenic origin found in 3.7\u00a0billion\u2013year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland.\nThe earliest identifiable fossils consist of stromatolites, which are microbial mats formed in shallow water by cyanobacteria. The earliest stromatolites are found in 3.48\u00a0billion-year-old sandstone discovered in Western Australia. Stromatolites are found throughout the Archean and become common late in the Archean.307 Cyanobacteria were instrumental in creating free oxygen in the atmosphere.\nFurther evidence for early life is found in 3.47\u00a0billion-year-old baryte, in the Warrawoona Group of Western Australia. This mineral shows sulfur fractionation of as much as 21.1%, which is evidence of sulfate-reducing bacteria that metabolize sulfur-32 more readily than sulfur-34.\nEvidence of life in the Late Hadean is more controversial. In 2015, biogenic carbon was detected in zircons dated to 4.1\u00a0billion years ago, but this evidence is preliminary and needs validation.\nEarth was very hostile to life before 4,300 to 4,200 Ma, and the conclusion is that before the Archean Eon, life as we know it would have been challenged by these environmental conditions. While life could have arisen before the Archean, the conditions necessary to sustain life could not have occurred until the Archean Eon.\nLife in the Archean was limited to simple single-celled organisms (lacking nuclei), called prokaryotes. In addition to the domain Bacteria, microfossils of the domain Archaea have also been identified. There are no known eukaryotic fossils from the earliest Archean, though they might have evolved during the Archean without leaving any. Fossil steranes, indicative of eukaryotes, have been reported from Archean strata but were shown to derive from contamination with younger organic matter. No fossil evidence has been discovered for ultramicroscopic intracellular replicators such as viruses.\nFossilized microbes from terrestrial microbial mats show that life was already established on land 3.22\u00a0Ga.\n\"Thuchomyces\", a Mesoarchean-Neoarchean fossil from South Africa, may be the first evidence of macroscopic land life, however it is likely a microbial mat due to a lack of eukaryotic features.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It stars John Wayne, Thomas Mitchell and Ian Hunter. It features Barry Fitzgerald, Wilfrid Lawson, John Qualen, Mildred Natwick, and Ward Bond, among others.\nThe film was adapted by Dudley Nichols from the plays \"The Moon of the Caribbees\", \"In the Zone\", \"Bound East for Cardiff\", and \"The Long Voyage Home\" by Eugene O'Neill. The original plays by Eugene O'Neill were written around the time of World War I and were among his earlier plays. Ford set the story for the motion picture, however, during the early days of World War II.\nWhile not one of Ford's best-known works, \"The Long Voyage Home\" continues to be well received. Film critics and scholars have noted Gregg Toland's distinctive cinematography, which serves as a precursor of the film noir aesthetic and hinted at his work for Orson Welles' film \"Citizen Kane\" (1941).\nPlot.\nA British tramp steamer named the SS \"Glencairn\" is on the long voyage home from the West Indies to Baltimore, and then to England during World War II. The crew is a motley, fun-loving, hard-drinking lot. Among them is their consensus leader, a middle-aged Irishman named Driscoll; a young Swedish ex-farmer, Ole Olsen; a spiteful steward nicknamed Cocky; a brooding Lord Jim-like Englishman, Smitty; and a burly, thoroughly dependable bruiser, Davis. On a sultry night in a port in the West Indies, the crew has been confined to the ship by order of the captain, but Drisk has arranged to import a boatload of local ladies. The crew carouse until a drunken brawl breaks out and the ladies are ordered off the ship and denied any of their promised compensation. The next day the ship sails to pick up its cargo for its return trip to England. When the crew discovers that the cargo is high explosives, they rebel, but are easily cowed into submission by the captain and the ship sails.\nThey are also concerned that Smitty might be a German spy because he is so aloof and secretive. After they assault Smitty and restrain and gag him, they force him to give up the key to a small metal box they have found in his bunk. Opening the box against Smitty's vigorous protests, they discover a packet of letters from Smitty's wife revealing the fact that Smitty has been an alcoholic, dishonorably discharged from the British navy. In the war zone as they near port, a German plane attacks the ship, killing Smitty in a burst of machine gun fire. Reaching England without further incident, the rest of the crew members decide not to sign on for another voyage on the \"Glencairn\" and go ashore, determined to help Ole return to his family in Sweden, whom he has not seen in ten years.\nIn spite of their determination to help Ole, the crew is incapable of passing up the opportunity for a good time drinking and dancing in a seedy bar to which they have been lured by an agent for ships looking for crew members. He has his eye on Ole because he is the biggest and strongest of the lot. He drugs Ole's drink, and his confederates shanghai him aboard another ship, the \"Amindra\". Driscoll and the rest of the drunk crew rescue Ole, but Driscoll is clubbed and left on board as the crew makes its escape. The next morning, the crew straggles back to the \"Glencairn\" to sign on for another voyage. A newspaper headline reveals that the \"Amindra\" has been sunk in the Channel by German torpedoes, killing all on board.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nIndependent film producer Walter Wanger made film-making history during the production of this film. He hired nine prominent American artists, all painters, to document the dramatic scenes during the film's production. Mr. Wanger offered a commission of over $50,000 to encourage the artists to participate, these funds were secured with the help of Reeves Lowenthal, the director of the Associated American Artists. No other undertaking of this magnitude and purpose had been done before in Hollywood film making. The artists insisted on three things to ensure a quality effort: freedom of choice on subject matter, studios on the production lot, and a projection room for viewing rushes. The artists who participated were Thomas Hart Benton, Grant Wood, George Biddle, James Chapin, Ernest Fiene, Robert Philipp, Luis Quintanilla, Raphael Soyer and Georges Schreiber. Eleven original paintings emerged from this inaugural effort. These toured the country in the museum circuit of the day beginning with a display in the Associated American Artists Galleries on Fifth Avenue in New York City.\nAs Orson Welles did the following year in \"Citizen Kane\", director John Ford shared his title card with cinematographer Gregg Toland in the opening credits for \"The Long Voyage Home\".\nRelease.\nThe film did poorly in its theatrical release, losing $224,336. Some critics suggested that the film failed to appeal to the general public because it was too dark and lacked a romance.\nIt was released on DVD in 2006 by Warner Bros.

It has not yet been released on DVD or Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection, but is available for streaming on Criterion Channel as of June 2020.\nIt is available as part of a John Ford box set, Region 2.\nReception.\nFilm critic Bosley Crowther of \"The New York Times\" liked the screenplay, the message of the film, and John Ford's direction, writing:John Ford has truly fashioned a modern Odyssey\u2014a stark and tough-fibered motion picture which tells with lean economy the never-ending story of man's wanderings over the waters of the world in search of peace for his soul...it is harsh and relentless and only briefly compassionate in its revelation of man's pathetic shortcomings. But it is one of the most honest pictures ever placed upon the screen; it gives a penetrating glimpse into the hearts of little men and, because it shows that out of human weakness there proceeds some nobility, it is far more gratifying than the fanciest hero-worshiping fare.\nThe staff at \"Variety\" magazine wrote:Combining dramatic content of four Eugene O'Neill one-act plays, John Ford pilots adventures of a tramp steamer from the West Indies to an American port, and then across the Atlantic with [a] cargo of high explosives. Picture is typically Fordian, his direction accentuating characterizations and adventures of the voyage. \"Harrison's Reports\" called it \"A powerful picture, directed with skill and acted with artistry.\" \"Film Daily\" called it \"a powerful, realistic vehicle, human and dramatic from main title to finish.\" John Mosher of \"The New Yorker\" wrote a rave review: \"[One] of the magnificent films of film history. Never has the sea, its infinite pictorial possibilities, been so comprehended upon the screen and its beauty and its threat so eloquently conveyed.\"\nO'Neill told Ford the film was a \"grand, deeply moving and beautiful piece of work...a great picture.\"\nRotten Tomatoes reports 100% approval from critics, based on nine reviews.\nThe title track of folk musician Phil Ochs's album \"Pleasures of the Harbor\" was directly inspired by a viewing of the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62694", "revid": "43768634", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62694", "title": "Stromatolite", "text": "Layered sedimentary structure\nStromatolites ( ) or stromatoliths (from grc \" ' ()\", \" ()\"\u00a0'layer, stratum' and \" ' ()\"\u00a0'rock') are layered sedimentary formations (microbialite) that are created mainly by photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria, sulfate-reducing bacteria, and Pseudomonadota (formerly proteobacteria). These microorganisms produce adhesive compounds that cement sand and other rocky materials to form mineral \"microbial mats\". In turn, these mats build up layer by layer, growing gradually over time.\nThis process generates the characteristic lamination of stromatolites, a feature that is hard to interpret, in terms of its temporal and environmental significance. Different styles of stromatolite lamination have been described, which can be studied through microscopic and mathematical methods. A stromatolite may grow to a meter or more. Fossilized stromatolites provide important records of some of the most ancient life. As of the Holocene, living forms are rare.\nDefinition.\nStromatolites are layered, biochemical, accretionary structures formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding and cementation of sedimentary grains in biofilms (specifically microbial mats), through the action of certain microbial lifeforms, especially cyanobacteria.\nAncient stromatolites.\nMorphology.\nFossilized stromatolites exhibit a variety of forms and structures, or morphologies, including conical, stratiform, domal, columnar, and branching types. Stromatolites occur widely in the fossil record of the Precambrian but are rare today. Very few Archean stromatolites contain fossilized microbes, but fossilized microbes are sometimes abundant in Proterozoic stromatolites.\nWhile features of some ancient apparent stromatolites are suggestive of biological activity, others possess features that are more consistent with abiotic (non-biological) precipitation. Finding reliable ways to distinguish between biologically formed and abiotic stromatolites is an active area of research in geology. Multiple morphologies of stromatolites may exist in a single local or geological stratum, depending on specific conditions at the time of their formation, such as water depth.\nMost stromatolites are spongiostromate in texture, having no recognisable microstructure or cellular remains. A minority are porostromate, having recognisable microstructure; these are mostly unknown from the Precambrian but persist throughout the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic. Since the Eocene, porostromate stromatolites are known only from freshwater settings.\nFossil record.\nSome Archean rock formations show macroscopic similarity to modern microbial structures, leading to the inference that these structures represent evidence of ancient life, namely stromatolites. However, others regard these patterns as being the result of natural material deposition or some other abiogenic mechanism. Scientists have argued for a biological origin of stromatolites due to the presence of organic globule clusters within the thin layers of the stromatolites, of aragonite nanocrystals (both features of current stromatolites), and of other microstructures in older stromatolites that parallel those in younger stromatolites that show strong indications of biological origin.\nStromatolites are a major constituent of the fossil record of the first forms of life on Earth. They peaked about 1.25 billion years ago (Ga) and subsequently declined in abundance and diversity, so that by the start of the Cambrian they had fallen to 20% of their peak. The most widely supported explanation is that stromatolite builders fell victim to grazing creatures (the Cambrian substrate revolution); this theory implies that sufficiently complex organisms were common around 1 Ga. Another hypothesis is that protozoa such as foraminifera were responsible for the decline, favoring formation of thrombolites over stromatolites through microscopic bioturbation.\nProterozoic stromatolite microfossils (preserved by permineralization in silica) include cyanobacteria and possibly some forms of the eukaryote chlorophytes (that is, green algae). One genus of stromatolite very common in the geologic record is \"Collenia\".\nThe connection between grazer and stromatolite abundance is well documented in the younger Ordovician evolutionary radiation; stromatolite abundance also increased after the Late Ordovician mass extinction and Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event decimated marine animals, falling back to earlier levels as marine animals recovered. Fluctuations in metazoan population and diversity may not have been the only factor in the reduction in stromatolite abundance. Factors such as the chemistry of the environment may have been responsible for changes.\nWhile prokaryotic cyanobacteria reproduce asexually through cell division, they were instrumental in priming the environment for the evolutionary development of more complex eukaryotic organisms. They are thought to be largely responsible for increasing the amount of oxygen in the primeval Earth's atmosphere through their continuing photosynthesis (see Great Oxygenation Event). They use water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight to create their food. A layer of polysaccharides often forms over mats of cyanobacterial cells. In modern microbial mats, debris from the surrounding habitat can become trapped within the polysaccharide layer, which can be cemented together by the calcium carbonate to grow thin laminations of limestone. These laminations can accrete over time, resulting in the banded pattern common to stromatolites. The domal morphology of biological stromatolites is the result of the vertical growth necessary for the continued infiltration of sunlight to the organisms for photosynthesis. Layered spherical growth structures termed oncolites are similar to stromatolites and are also known from the fossil record. Thrombolites are poorly laminated or non-laminated clotted structures formed by cyanobacteria, common in the fossil record and in modern sediments. There is evidence that thrombolites form in preference to stromatolites when foraminifera are part of the biological community.\nThe Zebra River Canyon area of the Kubis platform in the deeply dissected Zaris Mountains of southwestern Namibia provides a well-exposed example of the thrombolite-stromatolite-metazoan reefs that developed during the Proterozoic period, the stromatolites here being better developed in updip locations under conditions of higher current velocities and greater sediment influx.\nModern occurrence.\nFormation.\nTime lapse photography of modern microbial mat formation in a laboratory setting gives some revealing clues to the behavior of cyanobacteria in stromatolites. Biddanda \"et al.\" (2015) found that cyanobacteria exposed to localized beams of light moved towards the light, or expressed phototaxis, and increased their photosynthetic yield, which is necessary for survival. In a novel experiment, the scientists projected a school logo onto a petri dish containing the organisms, which accreted beneath the lighted region, forming the logo in bacteria. The authors speculate that such motility allows the cyanobacteria to seek light sources to support the colony.\nIn both light and dark conditions, the cyanobacteria form clumps that then expand outwards, with individual members remaining connected to the colony via long tendrils. In harsh environments where mechanical forces may tear apart the microbial mats, these substructures may provide evolutionary benefit to the colony, affording it at least some measure of shelter and protection.\nLichen stromatolites are a proposed mechanism of formation of some kinds of layered rock structure that are formed above water, where rock meets air, by repeated colonization of the rock by endolithic lichens.\nSaline locations.\nModern stromatolites are mostly found in hypersaline lakes and marine lagoons where high saline levels prevent animal grazing. One such location where excellent modern specimens can be observed is Hamelin Pool Marine Nature Reserve, Shark Bay in Western Australia. In 2010, a fifth type of chlorophyll, namely chlorophyll f, was discovered by Min Chen from stromatolites in Shark Bay. \"Halococcus hamelinensis\", a halophilic archaeon, occurs in living stromatolites in Shark Bay where it is exposed to extreme conditions of UV radiation, salinity and desiccation. \"H. hamelinesis\" possesses genes that encode enzymes employed in the repair of UV induced damages in DNA by the processes of nucleotide excision repair and photoreactivation.\nOther locations include Pampa del Tamarugal National Reserve in Chile; Lagoa Salgada, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, where modern stromatolites can be observed as both bioherms (domal type) and beds; in the Puna de Atacama of the Andes; and near Sheybarah Island in Saudi Arabia.\nInland stromatolites can be found in saline waters in Cuatro Ci\u00e9negas Basin, a unique ecosystem in the Mexican desert. Alchichica Lake in Puebla, Mexico has two distinct morphologic generations of stromatolites: columnar-dome like structures, rich in aragonite, forming near the shore line, dated back to 1,100 years before present (ybp) and spongy-cauliflower like thrombolytic structures that dominate the lake from top to the bottom, mainly composed of hydromagnesite, huntite, calcite and dated back to 2,800 ybp. The only open marine environment where modern stromatolites are known to prosper is the Exuma Cays in the Bahamas.\nFreshwater locations.\nLaguna de Bacalar in Mexico's southern Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula has an extensive formation of living giant microbialites (that is, stromatolites or thrombolites). The microbialite bed is over long with a vertical rise of several meters in some areas. These may be the largest sized living freshwater microbialites, or any organism, on Earth.\nA 1.5\u00a0km stretch of reef-forming stromatolites (primarily of the genus \"Scytonema\") occurs in Chetumal Bay in Belize, just south of the mouth of the Rio Hondo and the Mexican border. Large microbialite towers up to 40 m high were discovered in the largest soda lake on Earth, Lake Van in eastern Turkey. They are composed of aragonite and grow by precipitation of calcite from sub-lacustrine karst-water. Freshwater stromatolites are found in Lake Salda in southern Turkey. The waters are rich in magnesium and the stromatolite structures are made of hydromagnesite.\nTwo instances of freshwater stromatolites are found in Canada, at Pavilion Lake and Kelly Lake in British Columbia. Pavilion Lake has the largest known freshwater stromatolites, and NASA has conducted xenobiology research there, called the \"Pavilion Lake Research Project.\" The goal of the project is to better understand what conditions would likely harbor life on other planets.\nMicrobialites have been discovered in an open pit pond at an abandoned asbestos mine near Clinton Creek, Yukon,\nCanada. These microbialites are extremely young and presumably began forming soon after the mine closed in 1978. The combination of a low sedimentation rate, high calcification rate, and low microbial growth rate appears to result in the formation of these microbialites. Microbialites at an historic mine site demonstrates that an anthropogenically constructed environment can foster microbial carbonate formation. This has implications for creating artificial environments for building modern microbialites including stromatolites.\nA very rare type of non-lake dwelling stromatolite lives in the Nettle Cave at Jenolan Caves, NSW, Australia. The cyanobacteria live on the surface of the limestone and are sustained by the calcium-rich dripping water, which allows them to grow toward the two open ends of the cave which provide light.\nStromatolites composed of calcite have been found in both the Blue Lake in the dormant volcano, Mount Gambier and at least eight cenote lakes including the Little Blue Lake in the Lower South-East of South Australia.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "62695", "revid": "42581527", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62695", "title": "Our Town", "text": "1938 three-act play by Thornton Wilder\nOur Town is a three-act play written by American playwright Thornton Wilder in 1938. Described by Edward Albee as \"the greatest American play ever written\", it presents the fictional American town of Grover's Corners between 1901 and 1913 through the everyday lives of its citizens. \nWilder uses metatheatrical devices, setting the play in the actual theatre where it is being performed. The main character is the stage manager of the theatre who directly addresses the audience, brings in guest lecturers, fields questions from the audience, and fills in playing some of the roles. The play is performed without a set on a mostly bare stage. With a few exceptions, the actors mime actions without the use of props.\nThe first performance of \"Our Town\" was at the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, on January 22, 1938. It went on to success on Broadway and received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, and remains popular today with frequent revivals.\nSynopsis.\nAct I: Daily Life.\nThe Stage Manager introduces the audience to the small town of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire, its geography and main buildings and institutions, as well as the people living there, as morning breaks on May 7, 1901. Joe Crowell delivers the paper to Doc Gibbs, Howie Newsome delivers the milk, and the Webb and Gibbs households send their children (Emily and Wally Webb, George and Rebecca Gibbs) off to school on this beautifully simple morning. \nThe Stage Manager introduces Professor Willard, who speaks to the audience about the history of the town. Next, Editor Webb speaks to the audience about the town's socioeconomic status, political and religious demographics, and the accessibility and proliferation (or lack thereof) of culture and art in Grover's Corners. The Stage Manager then leads the audience through a series of pivotal moments throughout the afternoon and evening, revealing the characters' relationships and challenges. \nIt is at this time when we are introduced to Simon Stimson, an organist and choir director at the Congregational Church. It is learned from Mrs. Louella Soames that Simon Stimson is an alcoholic when she, Mrs. Gibbs, and Mrs. Webb stop on the corner after choir practice and \"gossip like a bunch of old hens,\" according to Doc Gibbs, discussing Simon's alcoholism. It seems to be a well known fact amongst everyone in town that Simon Stimson has a problem with alcohol; all the characters speak of his issue as if they are aware of it and his having \"seen a peck of trouble,\" a phrase repeated by more than one character throughout the show. While the majority of townsfolk choose to \"look the other way,\" including the town policeman, Constable Warren, it is Mrs. Gibbs who takes Simon's struggles with addiction to heart, and has a conversation with her husband, Doc Gibbs, about Simon's drinking.\nUnderneath a glowing full moon, Act I ends with siblings George and Rebecca, and Emily gazing out of their respective bedroom windows, enjoying the smell of heliotrope in the \"wonderful (or terrible) moonlight,\" with the self-discovery of Emily and George liking each other, and the realization that they are both straining to grow up in their own way.\nThe audience is dismissed to the first intermission by the Stage Manager who quips, \"That's the end of Act I, folks. You can go and smoke, now. Those that smoke.\"\nAct II: Love and Marriage.\nThe Stage Manager sets the scene by explaining three years have passed, and describing the many changes that can take place when \"the sun's come up over a thousand times.\" The Stage Manager notes the themes of Acts I and II - daily life, then marriage - and adds with portent, \"There's another act coming after this: I reckon you can guess what that's about.\"\nGeorge and Emily prepare to wed. The day is filled with stress. Howie Newsome is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an impulsive and awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. \nHere, the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, to the end of Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and confess their love for each other. George decides not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. \nBack in the present, George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry\u2014George to his mother, Emily to her father\u2014but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding. The Stage Manager, as officiant of the wedding, delivers a monologue on the institution of marriage: \"people were made to live two by two\" - but concludes, \"I've married over two hundred couples in my day. Do I believe in it? I don't know.\"\nNonetheless, the wedding completes and George and Emily leave, ending Act II, as Mrs. Soames exclaims, \"I'm sure they'll be happy. I always say: happiness, that's the great thing! The important thing is to be happy.\"\nAct III: Death and Eternity.\nNine years have passed. In a lengthy monologue, the Stage Manager discusses eternity (\"we all know something is eternal\"), focusing attention on the cemetery outside of town, which dates to the 1670s, including people who have died since the wedding - Mrs. Gibbs (pneumonia, while traveling), Wally Webb (burst appendix, while camping), Mrs. Soames, and Simon Stimson (suicide by hanging). The Stage Manager posits \"the dead don't stay interested in us living people for very long . . . gradually they lose hold of the earth . . . They're waitin'. They're waitin' for something that they feel is comin'. Something important, and great.\" \nTown undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced, as is a young man named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover's Corners for his cousin's funeral. That cousin is revealed to be Emily, who died giving birth to her and George's second child. \nOnce the funeral ends Emily emerges to join the dead and, after observing the grief of George and Dr. Gibbs, asks Mrs. Gibbs if it is possible to temporarily return. Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life, warning her that being able to see but not interact with her family, all the while knowing what will happen in the future, will cause her too much pain. Ignoring the warnings of Simon, Mrs. Soames, and Mrs. Gibbs (\"our life here is to forget all that, and think only of what's ahead\"), Emily returns to Earth to relive one day, her 12th birthday. \nShe joyfully watches her parents and some of the people of her childhood for the first time in years, but her happiness quickly turns to pain as she realizes how little people appreciate the simple activities of life (\"It goes so fast. We don't have time to look at one another.\"). The recognition proves too painful for her (\"all that was going on, and we never noticed\") and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured. \nEmily asks the Stage Manager to return her to the dead, then hesitates and in a final monologue says goodbye to mortal life (\"Oh earth, you're too wonderful for anybody to realize you\"). She asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it; he responds, \"No. The saints and poets, maybe \u2013 they do some.\" \nEmily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her. The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night.\nComposition.\nWilder began making notes for the play while he was teaching and lecturing in Chicago in the 1930s. Constantly on the move, he worked on the play wherever he went. In June 1937, he stayed in the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough, New Hampshire, one of the many locations where he worked on the play. It is believed Wilder drafted the entire third act during a visit to Z\u00fcrich in September 1937, in one day, after a long evening walk in the rain with a friend, author Samuel Morris Steward.\nWilder explained his vision in writing the play:\n\"Our Town\" is not offered as a picture of life in a New Hampshire village or as a speculation about the condition of life after death. . . .It is an attempt to find a value above all price for the smallest events in our life. I have made the claim as preposterous as possible, for I have set the village against the largest dimension of time and place. The recurrent words in this play (few have noticed it) are \"hundreds\", \"thousands\", and \"millions\".\nSetting.\nThe play is set in the actual theatre where the play is being performed, but the date is always May 7, 1901. The Stage Manager of the May 7, 1901, production introduces the play-within-the-play, which is set in the fictional community of Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. The Stage Manager locates Grover's Corners at latitude 42\u00b0\u00a040\u2032\u00a0N and longitude 70\u00b0\u00a037\u2032\u00a0W, though these coordinates are actually in waters about 300 meters off the coast of Rockport, Massachusetts. At the beginning of Act III, he mentions several nearby New Hampshire landmarks, including Mt. Monadnock and the towns of Jaffrey, Jaffrey Center, Peterborough, and Dublin.\nStyle.\nIn Wilder's writing of \"Our Town\", he employed a metatheatrical style. He utilized the Stage Manager role to narrate the story and also to appear as several different characters. The Stage Manager, as the play's \"Narrator,\" creates the story's point of view. The Narrator is supernatural as he is entirely aware of his relationship with the audience; as such it allows him freedom to break the fourth wall and address them directly. \nThe play's stage direction indicates that the play is to be staged and performed with little scenery, no set, and minimal props. Wilder's reasoning was, \"...I tried to restore significance to the small details of life by removing the scenery. The spectator through lending his imagination to the action restages it inside his own head. In its healthiest ages, the theatre has always exhibited the least scenery.\" \nWilder commented on the sparse stage setting:\nEach individual assertion to an absolute reality can only be inner, very inner. And here the method of staging finds its justification\u2013in the first two acts there are at least a few chairs and tables; but when Emily revisits the earth and the kitchen to which she descended on her twelfth birthday, the very chairs and table are gone. Our claim, our hope, our despair is in the mind\u2013not in things, not in \"scenery\". Moliere said that for the theater all he needed was a platform and a passion or two. The climax of this play needs only five square feet of boarding and the passion to know what life means to us.\nThe characters mime the objects with which they interact. Their surroundings are created only with chairs, tables, staircases, and other mundane objects. For example, the scene in which Emily helps George with his evening homework, conversing through upstairs windows, is often performed with the two actors standing atop separate ladders to represent their neighboring houses.\nWilder called \"Our Town\" his favorite out of all his works, but complained that it was rarely done right, insisting that it \"should be performed without sentimentality or ponderousness\u2014simply, dryly, and sincerely.\"\nProduction history.\n\"Our Town\" was first performed at the McCarter Theater in Princeton, New Jersey, on January 22, 1938.\nIt next opened at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston, on January 25, 1938.\nThe New York City debut of \"Our Town\" was on February 4, 1938, at Henry Miller's Theatre and later moved to the Morosco Theatre, where it ran until November 19, 1938; this production was produced and directed by Jed Harris. Wilder received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1938 for the work. The Jed Harris production of \"Our Town\" was revived at New York City Center on January 10, 1944, running for 24 performances until January 29, with Montgomery Clift as George, Martha Scott as Emily, and Thomas W. Ross as Mr. Webb.\nIn 1946, the Soviet Union prevented a production of \"Our Town\" in the Russian sector of occupied Berlin \"on the grounds that the drama is too depressing and could inspire a German suicide wave.\"\nVictor Carin directed a production by the Edinburgh Gateway Company in 1965.\nHenry Fonda played the Stage Manager in a production that ran on Broadway from Nov 27 to Dec 27, 1969. Elizabeth Hartman played Emily and Harvey Evans played George. Margaret Hamilton and Ed Begley were in the cast. \nA production at New York City's Lyceum Theatre, produced by Lincoln Center opened on December 4, 1988, after 27 previews, and ran for 136 performances until April 2, 1989; the cast included Spalding Gray as \"Stage Manager,\" Frances Conroy as Mrs. Gibbs, Penelope Ann Miller as Emily, and Eric Stoltz as George. The production was videotaped for broadcast on PBS (see \"Adaptations\" below).\nIn 2003, Paul Newman, marking his final stage performance, acted in the role of Stage Manager, with Jayne Atkinson as Mrs. Gibbs and Jane Curtin as Mrs. Webb, in a production staged at New York City's Booth Theatre. It opened on December 4, 2002, after three previews and ran until January 26, 2003. The production was videotaped for broadcast on Showtime and later on PBS (see \"Adaptations\" below).\nA revival of \"Our Town\" opened at the Barrow Street Theatre, in New York City, on February 26, 2009. The production was directed by David Cromer, who also performed the role of Stage Manager for much of the show's run. Upon closing, the production had played four preview and 644 regular performances, making it the longest-running production of the play in its history. In addition to Cromer, other notable actors who performed in the role of Stage Manager included Helen Hunt, Michael McKean, Jason Butler Harner, Stephen Kunken and Michael Shannon.\nIn 2017, Tony Award\u2013winning Deaf West Theater, a Los Angeles\u2013based theater company, co-produced with the Pasadena Playhouse a production of \"Our Town\" performed in American Sign Language and spoken English.\nA new revival directed by Kenny Leon opened on Broadway on October 10, 2024 with Jim Parsons as the Stage Manager, Zoey Deutch as Emily Webb, Katie Holmes as Mrs. Webb, Billy Eugene Jones as Dr. Gibbs, Ephraim Sykes as George Gibbs, Richard Thomas as Mr. Webb, Michelle Wilson as Mrs. Gibbs, Julie Halston as Mrs. Soames, and Donald Webber Jr. as Simon Stimpson. The production began previews on 17 September 2024 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. This production closed on January 19, 2025.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Breeders tend to use the name \"cavy\" for the animal, but \"guinea pig\" is more commonly used in scientific and laboratory contexts. Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. Instead, they originated in the Andes region of South America, where wild guinea pigs can still be found today. Studies based on biochemistry and DNA hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist naturally in the wild, but are descendants of a closely related cavy species such as \"C.\u00a0tschudii\". Originally, they were domesticated as livestock (source of meat) in the Andean region and are still consumed in some parts of the world.\nIn Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a pet since its introduction to Europe and North America by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them have continued to make guinea pigs a popular choice of household pets. Consequently, organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Through artificial selection, many specialized breeds with varying coat colors and textures have been selected by breeders.\nLivestock breeds of guinea pig play an important role in folk culture for many indigenous Andean peoples, especially as a food source. They are not only used in folk medicine and in community religious ceremonies but also raised for their meat. Guinea pigs are an important culinary staple in the Andes Mountains, where it is known as \"cuy\". In the mid-2000s, marketers sought to expand its consumption beyond South America.\nBiological experimentation on domestic guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were used so frequently as model organisms in the 19th and 20th centuries that the epithet \"guinea pig\" came into use to describe a human test subject. Since that time, they have mainly been replaced by other rodents, such as mice and rats. However, they are still used in research, primarily as models to study such human medical conditions as juvenile diabetes, tuberculosis, scurvy (like humans, they require dietary intake of vitamin C), and pregnancy complications.\nHistory.\n\"Cavia porcellus\" is not found naturally in the wild; it is likely descended from closely related species of cavies, such as \"C.\u00a0aperea\", \"C.\u00a0fulgida\", and \"C.\u00a0tschudii\". These closely related species are still commonly found in various regions of South America. Studies from 2007 to 2010 applying molecular markers, and morphometric studies on the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals revealed the ancestor to be most likely \"C.\u00a0tschudii\". Some species of cavy, identified in the 20th century as \"C.\u00a0anolaimae\" and \"C.\u00a0guianae\", may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild.\nRegionally known as \"cuy\" (a Spanish word derived from the Quechua \"quwi\"), the guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000\u00a0BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America (the present-day southern part of Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia), some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American camelids. The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art.\nEarly accounts from Spanish settlers state that guinea pigs were the preferred sacrificial animal of the Inca people native to Peru. These claims are supported by archaeological digs and transcribed Quechua mythology, providing evidence that sacrificial rituals involving guinea pigs served many purposes in society such as appeasing the gods, accompanying the dead, or reading the future.\nFrom about 1200 to the Spanish conquest in 1532, the indigenous people used selective breeding to develop many varieties of domestic guinea pigs, forming the basis for some modern domestic breeds. They continue to be a food source in the region; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal.\nIn the early 1500s, Spanish, Dutch, and English traders took guinea pigs to Europe, where they quickly became popular as exotic pets among the upper classes and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I. The earliest known written account of the guinea pig dates from 1547, in a description of the animal from Santo Domingo. Because cavies are not native to Hispaniola, the animal was believed to have been earlier introduced there by Spanish travelers. However, based on more recent excavations on West Indian islands, the animal may have been introduced to the Caribbean around 500 BC by ceramic-making horticulturalists from South America. It was present in the Ostionoid period on Puerto Rico, for example, long before the advent of the Spaniards.\nThe guinea pig was first described in the West in 1554 by the Swiss naturalist Conrad Gessner. Its binomial scientific name was first used by Erxleben in 1777; it is an amalgam of Pallas' generic designation (1766) and Linnaeus' specific conferral (1758).\nThe earliest-known European illustration of a domestic guinea pig is a painting (artist unknown) in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery in London, dated to 1580, which shows a girl in a typical Elizabethan dress holding a tortoise-shell guinea pig in her hands. She is flanked by her two brothers, one of whom holds a pet bird. The picture dates from the same period as the oldest recorded guinea pig remains in England, which are a partial cavy skeleton found at Hill Hall, an Elizabethan manor house in Essex, and dated to around 1575.\nNomenclature.\nLatin name.\nThe scientific name of the common species is \"Cavia porcellus\", with \"\" being Latin for \"little pig\". \"Cavia\" is Neo-Latin; it is derived from \"cabiai\", the animal's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana. \"Cabiai\" may be an adaptation of the Portuguese (now ), which is itself derived from the Tupi word , meaning rat.\nGuinea pig.\nThe origin of \"guinea\" in \"guinea pig\" is hard to explain. One proposed explanation is that the animals were brought to Europe by way of Guinea, leading people to think they had originated there. \"Guinea\" was also frequently used in English to refer generally to any far-off, unknown country, so the name may be a colorful reference to the animal's exotic origins.\nAnother hypothesis suggests the \"guinea\" in the name is a corruption of \"Guiana\", an area in South America. A common misconception is that they were so named because they were sold for the price of a guinea coin. This hypothesis is untenable because the guinea was first struck in England in 1663, and William Harvey used the term \"Ginny-pig\" as early as 1653. Others believe \"guinea\" may be an alteration of the word coney (rabbit); guinea pigs were referred to as \"pig coneys\" in Edward Topsell's 1607 treatise on quadrupeds.\nHow the animals came to be called \"pigs\" is not clear. They are built somewhat like pigs, with large heads relative to their bodies, stout necks, and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs, and they spend a large amount of time eating. They can survive for long periods in small quarters, like a \"pig pen\", and were easily transported by ship to Europe.\nOther languages.\nGuinea pigs are called ' or ' in Quechua and or (plural \"cuyes, cuyos\") in the Spanish of Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia.\nMany of the animal's names allude to pigs. The German word is , literally \"little sea pig\", apparently because they were brought to Germany from overseas. Similarly, in Polish they are called , in Hungarian , and in Russian ().\nThe French term is \"cochon d'Inde\" (Indian pig) or \"cobaye\"; the Dutch called it \"Guinees biggetje\" (Guinean piglet) or \"cavia\" (or in some dialects, ); and in Portuguese, it is variously referred to as \"cobaia\", from the Tupi word, or as (little Indian pig). This association with pigs is not universal among European languages; for example, the common word in Spanish is \"conejillo de Indias\" (little rabbit of the Indies).\nThe Chinese refer to the animal as (\"t\u00fansh\u01d4\", \"pig mouse\"), and sometimes as (\"h\u00e9l\u00e1nzh\u016b\", 'Netherlands pig') or (\"ti\u0101nzh\u00fash\u01d4\", \"Indian mouse\"). The Japanese word for guinea pig is (), which derives from the name of another mountain-dwelling rodent, the marmot. This word is how the guinea pigs were called by Dutch traders, who first brought them to Nagasaki in 1843. The other, and less common, Japanese word for guinea pig, using kanji, is \u5929\u7afa\u9f20 (\u3066\u3093\u3058\u304f\u306d\u305a\u307f or ), which translates as \"India rat\".\nBiology.\nGuinea pigs are relatively large for rodents. In pet breeds, adults typically weigh between and measure between in length. Some livestock breeds weigh when full grown. Pet breeds live an average of four to five years but may live as long as eight years. According to \"Guinness World Records\", as of 2006[ [update]], the longest-lived guinea pig was 14\u00a0years, 10\u00a0months, and 2 weeks old. Most guinea pigs have fur, but one laboratory breed adopted by some pet owners, the skinny pig, is mostly furless. In contrast, several breeds have long fur, such as the Peruvian, the Silkie, and the Texel. They have four front teeth and small back teeth. Their front teeth grow continuously, so guinea pigs chew on materials such as wood to wear them down to prevent them from becoming too long. In the 1990s, a minority scientific opinion emerged proposing that caviomorphs such as guinea pigs, chinchillas, and degus are not actually rodents, and should be reclassified as a separate order of mammals (similar to the rodent-like lagomorphs which includes rabbits and hares). Subsequent research using wider sampling restored the consensus among mammalian biologists regarding the current classification of rodents, including guinea pigs, as monophyletic.\nWild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle. They are social animals, living in the wild in small groups (\"herds\") that consist of several females (\"sows\"), a male (\"boar\"), and their young (\"pups\" not \"piglets\", a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature). Herds of animals move together, eating grass or other vegetation, yet do not store food. While they do not burrow themselves or build nests, they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals, as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation. They are crepuscular and tend to be most active during dawn and dusk when it is harder for predators to spot them.\nMale and female guinea pigs do not significantly differ in appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus is very close to the genitals in both sexes. Sexing animals at a young age must be done by someone trained in the differences. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap. While male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a similar shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair anterior to the genital region. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.\nBehavior.\nGuinea pigs can learn complex paths to food and can accurately remember a learned path for months. Their most robust problem-solving strategy is motion. While guinea pigs can jump small obstacles, they cannot jump very high. Most of them are poor climbers and are not particularly agile. They startle easily, and when they sense danger, they either freeze in place for long periods or run for cover with rapid, darting motions. Larger groups of startled guinea pigs \"stampede\", running in haphazard directions as a means of confusing predators. When happily excited, guinea pigs may (often repeatedly) perform little hops in the air (a movement known as \"popcorning\"), analogous to the ferret's war dance or rabbit happy hops (binkies). Guinea pigs are also good swimmers, although they do not like being wet and infrequently need bathing.\nLike many rodents, guinea pigs sometimes participate in social grooming and regularly self-groom. A milky-white substance is secreted from their eyes and rubbed into the hair during the grooming process. Groups of boars often chew each other's hair, but this is a method of establishing hierarchy within a group, rather than a social gesture. Dominance is also established through biting (especially of the ears), piloerection, aggressive noises, head thrusts, and leaping attacks. Non-sexual simulated mounting for dominance is also common among same-sex groups.\nGuinea pig eyesight is not as good as that of a human in terms of distance and color, but they have a wider angle of vision (about 340\u00b0) and see in partial color (dichromacy). They have well-developed senses of hearing, smell, and touch.\nGuinea pigs have developed a different biological rhythm from their wild counterparts and have longer periods of activity followed by short sleep in between. Activity is scattered randomly throughout the day; aside from an avoidance of intense light, no regular circadian patterns are apparent.Guinea pigs do not generally thrive when housed with other species. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some dogs and cats can be trained to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, rabbits have different nutritional requirements; as lagomorphs, they synthesize their own vitamin C, so the two species will not thrive if fed the same food when housed together. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from \"Bordetella\" and \"Pasteurella\"), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Housing guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward guinea pigs.\nVocalization.\nVocalization is the primary means of communication between members of the species. These are the most common sounds made by the guinea pig:\nReproduction.\nMales (boars) reach sexual maturity in 3\u20135 weeks. Similarly, females (sows) can be fertile as early as four weeks old and carry litters before becoming fully grown adults. A sow can breed year-round (with spring being the peak). A sow can have as many as five litters in a year, but six is theoretically possible. Unlike the offspring of most rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn cavy pups are precocial, and are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight. The pups are immediately mobile and capable of eating solid food, though they continue to suckle. Sows can once again become pregnant 6\u201348 hours after giving birth, but it is not healthy for a female to be constantly pregnant.\nThe gestation period lasts from , with an average of . Because of the long gestation period and the large size of the pups, pregnant sows may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies depending upon the size of the litter. Litter size ranges from one to six, with three being the average; the largest recorded litter size is 9. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 pups. In smaller litters, difficulties may occur during labour due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, but because the pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, lack of access to the mother's milk has little effect on the mortality rate of newborns.\nCohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating; guinea pigs practice alloparental care, in which a sow may adopt the pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are, for some reason, separated from them. This behavior is common and is seen in many other animal species, such as the elephant.\nToxemia of pregnancy (hypertension) is a common problem and kills many pregnant females. Signs of toxemia include anorexia (loss of appetite), lack of energy, excessive salivation, a sweet or fruity breath odor due to ketones, and seizures in advanced cases. Pregnancy toxemia appears to be most common in hot climates. Other serious complications during pregnancy can include a prolapsed uterus, hypocalcaemia, and mastitis.\nFemales that do not give birth may develop an irreversible fusing or calcified cartilage of the pubic symphysis, a joint in the pelvis, which may occur after six months of age. If they become pregnant after this has happened, the birth canal may not widen sufficiently, which may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth.\nHusbandry.\nLiving environment.\nDomestic guinea pigs generally live in cages, although some owners of large numbers of cavies dedicate entire rooms to their pets. Wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot (ulcerative pododermatitis), so cages with solid bottoms, where the animal walks directly on the bedding, are typically used. Large cages allow for adequate running space and can be constructed from wire grid panels and plastic sheeting, a style known as C&amp;C, or \"cubes and coroplast\".\nRed cedar (Eastern or Western) and pine, both softwoods, were commonly used as bedding. Still, these materials are believed to contain harmful phenols (aromatic hydrocarbons) and oils. Bedding materials made from hardwoods (such as aspen), paper products, and corn cobs are alternatives. Guinea pigs tend to be messy; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them, and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces, making it difficult to remove. After its cage has been cleaned, a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory. Male guinea pigs may mark their territory in this way when they are put back into their cages after being taken out.\nGuinea pigs thrive in groups of two or more; groups of sows or groups of one or more sows and a neutered boar are common combinations, but boars can sometimes live together. Guinea pigs learn to recognize and bond with other individual guinea pigs, and tests show that a boar's neuroendocrine stress response to a strange environment is significantly lowered in the presence of a bonded female but not with unfamiliar females. Groups of boars may also get along, provided their cage has enough space, they are introduced at an early age, and no females are present. In Switzerland, where owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being, keeping a guinea pig without a companion is illegal. There is a service to rent guinea pigs, to temporarily replace a dead cage-mate. Sweden has similar laws against keeping a guinea pig by itself.\nDiet.\nThe guinea pig's natural diet is grass; their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life. Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract. Guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents.\nEasily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. But to get nutrients out of hard-to-digest fiber, guinea pigs ferment fiber in the cecum (in the GI tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to utilize the nutrients. The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese. They share this behavior with lagomorphs (rabbits, hares, pikas) and some other animals.\nIn geriatric boars or sows (rarely in young ones), the muscles which allow the cecotropes to be expelled from the anus can become weak. This creates a condition known as fecal impaction, which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass. The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus.\nGuinea pigs benefit from a diet of fresh grass hay, such as timothy hay, in addition to food pellets, which are often based on timothy hay. Alfalfa hay is also a popular food choice, and most guinea pigs will eat large amounts of alfalfa when offered it, though some controversy exists over offering alfalfa to adult guinea pigs. Some pet owners and veterinary organizations have advised that, as a legume rather than a grass hay, alfalfa consumed in large amounts may lead to obesity, as well as bladder stones from the excess calcium in all animals except for pregnant and very young guinea pigs. However, published scientific sources mention alfalfa as a food source that can replenish protein, amino acids, and fiber.\nLike humans, but unlike most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot synthesize vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. They require about 10\u00a0mg of vitamin C daily (20\u00a0mg if pregnant), which can be obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or dietary supplements or by eating fresh pellets designed for guinea pigs, if they have been handled properly. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; but adequate amounts of vitamins A, D, and E are also necessary.\nPoor diets for guinea pigs have been associated with muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables after having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume. Their eating habits may be difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet, and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present, such as chewing on their hair. Being rodents, as their teeth grow constantly (as do their nails, like humans), they routinely gnaw on things, lest their teeth become too large for their jaw (a common problem in rodents). Guinea pigs chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber if available. Guinea pig owners may \"Guinea Pig proof\" their household, especially if they are free to roam, to avoid any destruction or harm to the guinea pig itself.\nSome plants are poisonous to guinea pigs, including bracken, bryony, buttercup, charlock, deadly nightshade, foxglove, hellebore, hemlock, lily of the valley, mayweed, monkshood, privet, ragwort, rhubarb, speedwell, toadflax (both \"Linaria vulgaris\" and \"Linaria dalmatica\"), and wild celery. Additionally, any plant which grows from a bulb (e.g., tulip or onion) is normally considered poisonous, as well as ivy and oak tree leaves.\nHealth problems.\nCommon ailments in domestic guinea pigs include respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, scurvy (vitamin C deficiency, typically characterized by sluggishness), abscesses due to infection (often in the neck, due to hay embedded in the throat, or from external scratches), and infections by lice, mites, or fungus.\nMange mites (\"Trixacarus caviae\") are a common cause of hair loss, and other symptoms may also include excessive scratching, unusually aggressive behavior when touched (due to pain), and, in some instances, seizures. Guinea pigs may also suffer from \"running lice\" (\"Gliricola porcelli\"), a small, white insect that can be seen moving through the hair; their eggs, which appear as black or white specks attached to the hair, are sometimes referred to as \"static lice\". Other causes of hair loss can be hormonal upsets caused by underlying medical conditions such as ovarian cysts.\nForeign bodies, especially tiny pieces of hay or straw, can become lodged in the eyes of guinea pigs, resulting in excessive blinking, tearing, and, in some cases, an opaque film over the eye due to corneal ulcer. Hay or straw dust can also cause sneezing. While it is normal for guinea pigs to sneeze periodically, frequent sneezing may be a symptom of pneumonia, especially in response to atmospheric changes. Pneumonia may also be accompanied by torticollis and can be fatal.\nBecause the guinea pig has a stout, compact body, it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat. Its normal body temperature is , so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human's, about . Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of have been linked to hyperthermia and death, especially among pregnant sows. Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts, and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30\u201370%.\nGuinea pigs are prey animals whose survival instinct is to mask pain and signs of illness, and many times, health problems may not be apparent until a condition is severe or in its advanced stages. Treatment of disease is made more difficult by the extreme sensitivity guinea pigs have to most antibiotics, including penicillin, which kill off the intestinal flora and quickly bring on episodes of diarrhea and in some cases, death.\nSimilar to the inherited genetic diseases of other breeds of animals (such as hip dysplasia in canines), some genetic abnormalities of guinea pigs have been reported. Most commonly, the roan coloration of Abyssinian guinea pigs is associated with congenital eye disorders and problems with the digestive system. Other genetic disorders include \"waltzing disease\" (deafness coupled with a tendency to run in circles), palsy, and tremor conditions.\nImportance.\nAs pets.\nSocial behaviors.\nIf handled correctly early in life, guinea pigs become amenable to being picked up and carried and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers who often hesitate to escape their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn to whistle in response to the rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored.\nCoats and grooming.\nDomesticated guinea pigs occur in many breeds that have developed since their introduction to Europe and North America. These varieties vary in hair and color composition. The most common variety found in pet stores is the English shorthair (also known as the American), which has a short, smooth coat, and the Abyssinian, whose coat is ruffled with cowlicks, or rosettes. Also popular among breeders are the Peruvian and the Sheltie (or Silkie), both straight longhair breeds, and the Texel, a curly longhair. Grooming of guinea pigs is primarily accomplished using combs or brushes. Shorthair breeds are typically brushed weekly, while longhair breeds may require daily grooming.\nClubs and associations.\nCavy clubs and associations dedicated to the showing and breeding guinea pigs have been established worldwide. The American Cavy Breeders Association, an adjunct to the American Rabbit Breeders' Association, is the governing body in the United States and Canada. The British Cavy Council governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council) and New Zealand (New Zealand Cavy Council). Each club publishes its standard of perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing.\nHuman allergies.\nAllergic symptoms, including rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma, have been documented in laboratory animal workers who come into contact with guinea pigs. Allergic reactions following direct exposure to guinea pigs in domestic settings have also been reported. Two major guinea pig allergens, Cav p I and Cav p II, have been identified in guinea pig fluids (urine and saliva) and guinea pig dander. People who are allergic to guinea pigs are usually allergic to hamsters and gerbils, as well. Allergy shots can successfully treat an allergy to guinea pigs. However, treatment can take up to 18 months.\nTraditional uses in Andean populations.\nFolklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous; they are exchanged as gifts, used in customary social and religious ceremonies, and frequently referred to in spoken metaphors. They also are used in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors, or \"curanderos\", who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice, rheumatism, arthritis, and typhus. They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick and are seen as a supernatural medium. Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses. The animal may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective. These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes, where Western medicine is unavailable or distrusted.\nPeruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year. The animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and his disciples dining on guinea pig. The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru. A religious celebration, known as (\"collecting the cuys\"), is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima. It is a syncretistic event, combining elements of Catholicism and pre-Columbian religious practices, and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints. The exact form the takes differs from town to town; in some localities, a \"sirvinti\" (servant) is appointed to go from door to door, collecting donations of guinea pigs, while in others, guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight. Meals such as \"cuy chactado\" are always served as part of these festivities, and the killing and serving of the animal are framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures. In the Tungurahua and Cotopaxi provinces of central Ecuador, guinea pigs are employed in the celebrations surrounding the feast of Corpus Christi as part of the \"Ensayo\", which is a community meal, and the \"Octava\", where \"castillos\" (greased poles) are erected with prizes tied to the crossbars, from which several guinea pigs may be hung. The Peruvian town of Churin has an annual festival that involves dressing guinea pigs in elaborate costumes for competition. There are also guinea pig festivals held in Huancayo, Cusco, Lima, and Huacho, featuring costumes and guinea pig dishes. Most guinea pig celebrations occur on National Guinea Pig Day (D\u00eda Nacional del Cuy) across Peru on the second Friday of October.\nIn popular culture and media.\nAs a result of their widespread popularity, especially in households with children, guinea pigs have shown a presence in culture and media. Some noted appearances of the animal in literature include the short story \"Pigs Is Pigs\" by Ellis Parker Butler, which is a tale of bureaucratic incompetence. Two guinea pigs held at a railway station breed unchecked while humans argue whether they are \"pigs\" or \"pets\" to determine freight charges. Butler's story, in turn, inspired the \"\" episode \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", written by David Gerrold.\nIn children's literature.\n\"The Fairy Caravan\", a novel by Beatrix Potter, and Michael Bond's Olga da Polga series for children, both feature guinea pigs as the protagonist. Another appearance is in \"The Magician's Nephew\" by C. S. Lewis: in the first (chronologically) of his \"The Chronicles of Narnia\" series, a guinea pig is the first creature to travel to the Wood between the Worlds. In Ursula Dubosarsky's \"Maisie and the Pinny Gig\", a little girl has a recurrent dream about a giant guinea pig, while guinea pigs feature significantly in several of Dubosarsky's other books, including the young adult novel \"The White Guinea Pig\" and \"The Game of the Goose\".\nIn film and television.\nGuinea pigs have also been featured in film and television. In the TV movie \"Shredderman Rules\", the main character and the main character's crush both have guinea pigs, which play a minor part in the plot. A guinea pig named Rodney, voiced by Chris Rock, was a prominent character in the 1998 film \"Dr. Dolittle\", and Linny the Guinea Pig is a co-star on Nick Jr.'s \"Wonder Pets\". Guinea pigs were used in some major advertising campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s, notably for Egg Banking plc, Snapple, and Blockbuster Video. In the \"South Park\" season 12 episode \"\", giant guinea pigs dressed in costumes rampage over the Earth. The 2009 Walt Disney Pictures movie \"G-Force\" features a group of highly intelligent guinea pigs trained as operatives of the U.S. government.\nAs livestock.\nIn South America.\nGuinea pigs (called \"cuy\", \"cuye\", or \"cur\u00ed\") were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals and as a delicacy by indigenous people in the Andean highlands. Still, since the 1960s, it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be a significant part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and in Colombia, mainly in the southwestern part of the country (Cauca and Nari\u00f1o departments). Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.\nGuinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken. The animal may be served fried (\"chactado\" or \"frito\"), broiled (\"asado\"), or roasted (\"al horno\"), and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee. Ecuadorians commonly consume \"sopa\" or \"locro de cuy\", a soup dish. \"Pachamanca\" or \"huatia\", an earth oven cooking method, is also popular, and cuy cooked this way is usually served with chicha (corn beer) in traditional settings.\nIn the United States, Europe, and Japan.\nAndean immigrants in New York City raise and sell guinea pigs for meat, and some South American restaurants in major cities in the United States serve \"cuy\" as a delicacy. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Molina University began exporting large-breed guinea pigs to Europe, Japan, and the United States in the hope of increasing human consumption outside of countries in northern South America.\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nEfforts have been made to promote guinea pig husbandry in developing countries of West Africa, where they occur more widely than generally known because they are usually not covered by livestock statistics. However, it has not been known when and where the animals have been introduced to Africa. In Cameroon, they are widely distributed. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they can be found both in peri-urban environments as well as in rural regions, for example, in South Kivu. They are also frequently held in rural households in Iringa Region of southwestern Tanzania.\nPeruvian breeding program.\nPeruvian research universities, especially La Molina National Agrarian University, began experimental programs in the 1960s intending to breed larger-sized guinea pigs. Subsequent university efforts have sought to change breeding and husbandry procedures in South America to make the raising of guinea pigs as livestock more economically sustainable. The variety of guinea pig produced by La Molina is fast-growing and can weigh . All the large breeds of guinea pig are known as \"cuy mejorados\" and the pet breeds are known as \"cuy criollos\". The three original lines out of Peru were the \"Per\u00fa\" (weighing by 2 weeks), the \"Andina\", and the \"Inti\".\nIn scientific research.\nThe use of guinea pigs in scientific experimentation dates back at least to the 17th century, when the Italian biologists Marcello Malpighi and Carlo Fracassati conducted vivisections of guinea pigs in their examinations of anatomic structures. In 1780, Antoine Lavoisier used a guinea pig in his experiments with the calorimeter, a device used to measure heat production. Guinea pigs played a major role in the establishment of germ theory in the late 19th century, through the experiments of Louis Pasteur, \u00c9mile Roux, and Robert Koch. Guinea pigs have been launched into orbital space flight several times, first by the USSR on the Sputnik 9 biosatellite of March 9, 1961 \u2013 with a successful recovery. China also launched and recovered a biosatellite in 1990 which included guinea pigs as passengers.\nGuinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century: about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s, but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s. As of 2007, they constitute about 2% of the current total of laboratory animals. In the past, they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions, or anaphylaxis. Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation. Since the middle 20th century, they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats. This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents, although geneticists W. E. Castle and Sewall Wright made some contributions to this area of study, especially regarding coat color. The guinea pig genome was sequenced in 2008 as part of the Mammalian Genome Project, but the guinea pig sequence scaffolds have not been assigned to chromosomes.\nThe guinea pig was most extensively used in research and diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, glanders, Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs to their use to prove the chemical structure of the \"scorbutic factor\" in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.\nComplement, an important component for serology, was first isolated from the blood of the guinea pig. Guinea pigs have an unusual insulin mutation, and are a suitable species for the generation of anti-insulin antibodies. Present at a level 10 times that found in other mammals, the insulin in guinea pigs may be important in growth regulation, a role usually played by growth hormone. Additionally, guinea pigs have been identified as model organisms for the study of juvenile diabetes and, because of the frequency of pregnancy toxemia, of pre-eclampsia in human females. Their placental structure is similar to that of humans, and their gestation period can be divided into trimesters that resemble the stages of fetal development in humans.\nGuinea pig strains used in scientific research are primarily outbred strains. Aside from the typical American or English stock, the two main outbred strains in laboratory use are the Hartley and Dunkin-Hartley; these English strains are albino, although pigmented strains are also available. Inbred strains are less common and are usually used for very specific research, such as immune system molecular biology. Of the inbred strains that have been created, the two still used with any frequency are, following Sewall Wright's designations, \"Strain 2\" and \"Strain 13\".\nHairless breeds of guinea pigs have been used in scientific research since the 1980s, particularly for dermatological studies. A hairless and immunodeficient breed was the result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in inbred laboratory strains from the Hartley stock at the Eastman Kodak Company in 1979. An immunocompetent hairless breed was also identified by the Institute Armand Frappier in 1978, and Charles River Laboratories has reproduced this breed for research since 1982. Cavy fanciers then began acquiring hairless breeds, and the pet hairless varieties are referred to as \"skinny pigs\".\nMetaphorical usage.\nIn English, the term \"guinea pig\" is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation, or in modern times a subject of any experiment or test. This usage dates back to the early 20th century: the earliest examples cited by the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" date from 1913 and 1920. In 1933, Consumers' Research founders F. J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled \"100,000,000 Guinea Pigs\", extending the metaphor to consumer society. The book became a national bestseller in the United States, thus further popularizing the term, and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement. During World War II, the Guinea Pig Club was established at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, Sussex, England, as a social club and mutual support network for the patients of plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe, who were undergoing previously untested reconstruction procedures. The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel \"The Guinea Pigs\" (1970) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Written primarily by American civilian officials during the occupation of Japan after World War II, it was adopted on 3 November 1946 and came into effect on 3 May 1947, succeeding the Meiji Constitution of 1889. The constitution consists of a preamble and 103 articles grouped into 11 chapters. It is based on the principles of popular sovereignty, with the Emperor of Japan as the symbol of the state; pacifism and the renunciation of war; and individual rights.\nUpon the surrender of Japan at the end of the war in 1945, Japan was occupied and U.S. General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, directed Prime Minister Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara to draft a new constitution. Shidehara created a committee of Japanese scholars for the task, but MacArthur reversed course in February 1946 and presented a draft created under his own supervision, which was reviewed and modified by the scholars before its adoption. Also known as the \"MacArthur Constitution\", , or , it is relatively short at 5,000 signs, less than a quarter the length of the average national constitution if one compares it with constitutions written in alphabetical word-based languages.\nThe constitution provides for a parliamentary system and three branches of government, with the National Diet (legislative), Cabinet led by a Prime Minister (executive), and Supreme Court (judicial) as the highest bodies of power. It guarantees individual rights, including legal equality; freedom of assembly, association, and speech; due process; and fair trial. In contrast to the Meiji Constitution, which invested the emperor with supreme political power, under the 1946 constitution his role in the system of constitutional monarchy is reduced to \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\", and he exercises only a ceremonial role under popular sovereignty. Article 9 of the constitution renounces Japan's right to wage war and to maintain military forces. Despite this, it retains a \"de facto\" military in the form of the Self-Defense Forces and hosts a substantial U.S. military presence. Amendments to the constitution require a two-thirds vote in both houses of the National Diet and approval in a referendum, and despite the efforts of conservative and nationalist forces to revise Article 9 in particular, it remains the world's oldest un-amended supreme constitutional text.\nHistorical origins.\nMeiji Constitution.\nThe Meiji Constitution was the fundamental law of the Empire of Japan, propagated during the reign of Emperor Meiji (r.\u20091867\u00a0\u2013\u00a01912). It provided for a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy, based on the Prussian and British models. In theory, the Emperor of Japan was the supreme leader, and the cabinet, whose prime minister was elected by a privy council, were his followers; in practice, the Emperor was head of state but the Prime Minister was the actual head of government. Under the Meiji Constitution, the prime minister and his cabinet were not accountable to the elected members of the Imperial Diet, and increasingly deferred to the Imperial Japanese Army in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nThe Potsdam Declaration.\nOn 26 July 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, Allied leaders of the United States (President Harry S. Truman), the United Kingdom (Prime Minister Winston Churchill), and the Republic of China (President Chiang Kai-shek) issued the Potsdam Declaration. The Declaration demanded Japanese military's unconditional surrender, demilitarisation and democratisation.\nThe declaration defined the major goals of the post-surrender Allied occupation: \"The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies among the Japanese people. Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be established\" (Section 10). In addition, \"The occupying forces of the Allies shall be withdrawn from Japan as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Japanese people a peacefully inclined and responsible government\" (Section 12). The Allies sought not merely punishment or reparations from a militaristic foe, but fundamental changes in the nature of its political system. In the words of a political scientist Robert\u00a0E. Ward: \"The occupation was perhaps the single most exhaustively planned operation of massive and externally directed political change in world history.\"\nThe Japanese government, Prime Minister Kantar\u014d Suzuki's administration and Emperor Hirohito accepted the conditions of the Potsdam Declaration, which necessitates amendments to its Constitution after the surrender.\nDrafting process.\nThe wording of the Potsdam Declaration\u2014\"The Japanese Government shall remove all obstacles\u00a0...\"\u2014and the initial post-surrender measures taken by MacArthur, suggest that neither he nor his superiors in Washington intended to impose a new political system on Japan unilaterally. Instead, they wished to encourage Japan's new leaders to initiate democratic reforms on their own. But by early 1946, MacArthur's staff and Japanese officials were at odds over the most fundamental issue, the writing of a new Constitution. Emperor Hirohito, Prime Minister Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, and most of the cabinet members were extremely reluctant to take the drastic step of replacing the 1889 Meiji Constitution with a more liberal document.\nFormer prime minister Fumimaro Konoe, Shidehara Cabinet and the civil constitutional study groups formed original constitutions. The formal draft constitution, which was created by the Shidehara Cabinet, was rejected by GHQ and the government reviewed the revised drafts by various political parties and accepted liberal ways of thinking especially toward the emperor as the symbol of nationals and dispossession of a military power.\nAfter World War II, the Allied Powers concluded an \"Instrument of Surrender\" with Japan, which stated that \"the Emperor and the Government of Japan shall come under the subordination of the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers\". Koseki interprets this statement as the GHQ's indirect rule through the Emperor and the Japanese government, rather than direct rule over the Japanese people. In other words, GHQ regarded the Emperor Hirohito not as a war criminal parallel to Hitler and Mussolini but as one governance mechanism.\nThe Japanese government at the end of World War II was organized by Higashikuni Cabinet (Prime Minister Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni), with Fumimaro Konoe, who had served as the prime minister during the Manchurian Incident in 1931, as a minister without portfolio. The trigger of constitutional amendment was from GHQ General MacArthur's word to Fumimaro Konoe. After an unsuccessful first visit on 13 September 1945, Fumimaro Konoe paid another visit to MacArthur at the GHQ headquarters on 4 October 1945. Although the GHQ later denied this fact, citing a mistake by the Japanese interpreter, diplomatic documents between Japan and the U.S. state that \"the Constitution must be amended to fully incorporate liberal elements\". \"At the meeting, the General told Konoe that the Constitution must be amended\". In this regard, it can be said that the GHQ granted Konoe the authority to amend the Constitution. However, at this point, the Higashikuninomiya Cabinet was succeeded by the Shidehara Cabinet, and J\u014dji Matsumoto, the then Minister of State, stated that the Cabinet should be the only one to amend the Constitution, and the Constitutional Problems Investigation Committee was established. In other words, there was a conflict between the Konoe and Shidehara cabinets as to who should take the initiative in constitutional amendment.\nHowever, this conflict ended with Konoe being nominated as a candidate for Class A war criminal due to domestic and international criticism. To begin with, Konoe was able to have the initiative to amend the Constitution because he had been assigned full-time by the GHQ to amend the constitution, although he was not an unappointed minister when the cabinet was changed. However, due to domestic and foreign criticism of Konoe, the GHQ announced on 1 November that Konoe had not been appointed to amend the Constitution and that he had no authority to lead the amendment of the constitution since the cabinet had changed. At that time, Konoe belonged to the Office of the Minister of the Interior, which was in charge of politics related to the Imperial Household, but since the Office of the Minister of the Interior was about to be abolished, he decided to submit a proposal for amendment before then. Konoe's proposal reflected the wishes of the GHQ and was very liberal in content, including \"limitation of the imperial prerogative,\" \"independent dissolution of the Diet,\" and \"freedom of speech,\" but it was never finally approved as a draft, and Konoe committed suicide by poisoning himself. After this, the authority to amend the Constitution was completely transferred to Shidehara's cabinet.\nIn late 1945, Shidehara appointed J\u014dji Matsumoto, state minister without portfolio, head of a blue-ribbon committee of Constitutional scholars to suggest revisions. The Matsumoto Committee was composed of the authorities of the Japanese law academia, including Tatsuki Minobe (\u7f8e\u6fc3\u90e8\u9054\u5409), and the first general meeting was held on 27 October 1945. J\u014dji Matsumoto presented the following four principles of constitutional amendment to the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives in 1945.\nFour principles of constitutional amendment\nThe Matsumoto Committee has prepared a constitutional amendment outline based on these principles.\nThe Matsumoto Commission's recommendations, made public in February 1946, were quite conservative as \"no more than a touching-up of the Meiji Constitution\". MacArthur rejected them outright and ordered his staff to draft a completely new document. An additional reason for this was that on 24 January 1946, Prime Minister Shidehara had suggested to MacArthur that the new Constitution should contain an article renouncing war.\nAs the momentum for constitutional amendment increased, interest in the constitution increased among the people. In fact, not only political parties but also private organizations have announced draft constitutional amendments.\nThe most famous of these is the outline of the draft constitution by the Constitution Study Group. The Constitutional Study Group was established on 29 October 1945 to study and prepare for the establishment of the Constitution from a leftist approach. While many political party drafts only added to the Meiji Constitution, their drafts included the principle of popular sovereignty, which grants sovereignty to the people and regards the Emperor as a symbol of the people. The Constitutional Study Group submitted a draft to the Prime Minister's Office on 26 December 1945. On 2 January 1946, GHQ issued a statement that it would focus on the content. Toyoharu Konishi states that the GHQ may have included the opinion of the Constitutional Study Group in the draft, reflecting the situation in the United States, where people disregarded popular sovereignty at that time. Also, regarding the symbolic emperor system, since the members of the Constitutional Study Group came into contact with the GHQ dignitaries earlier than the drafting of the guidelines, the Constitutional Study Group proposed the symbolic emperor system through the GHQ dignitaries. It is analyzed that it was reflected in the GHQ proposal.\nThe Constitution was mostly drafted by American authors. A few Japanese scholars reviewed and modified it. Much of the drafting was done by two senior army officers with law degrees: Milo Rowell and Courtney Whitney, although others chosen by MacArthur had a large say in the document. The articles about equality between men and women were written by Beate Sirota.\nMacArthur gave the authors less than a week to complete the draft, which was presented to surprised Japanese officials on 13 February 1946. MacArthur initially had a policy of not interfering with the revision of the Constitution, but from around January 1946, he made a statement to the Constitutional Draft Outline of the Constitutional Study Group and activated movements related to the Constitution. There are various theories as to the reason. Kenzo Yanagi mentioned the memorandum of Courtney Whitney, who was the director of the Civil Affairs Bureau of the General Headquarters, on 1 February 1946 as a reason for the attitude change. In the memorandum, it is mentioned that the Far Eastern Commission was about to be established. The Far Eastern Commission is the supreme policy-making body established by the United States, United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, China, Australia, and other allies to occupy and control Japan, and its authority was higher than that of GHQ. MacArthur learned that the Far Eastern Commission was interested in constitutional amendment, and thought that constitutional authority could be transferred to the Far Eastern Commission after the commission was established. Therefore, he might be eager to end the constitutional issue with unlimited authority before it was founded.\nOn 18 February, the Japanese government called on the GHQ to reconsider the MacArthur Draft, which is significantly different from the Matsumoto Draft, but Whitney rejected the proposal on 20 February. On the contrary, he asked the Japanese government for a reply within 48 hours. Then, Prime Minister Shidehara met with MacArthur on 21 February and decided to accept the MacArthur draft by a cabinet meeting on the following day.\nAfter Shidehara Cabinet decision, J\u014dji Matsumoto aimed to draft a Japanese government bill based on the MacArthur Draft, and the draft was completed on 2 March of the same year.\nOn 4 March J\u014dji Matsumoto presented the draft to Whitney, but GHQ noticed that there were differences between the MacArthur Draft and the 2 March Draft. In particular, the 2 March Draft did not include a preamble, and a heated argument ensued. Finally, adjustments were made by the Japanese government and GHQ, and the draft was completed on 6 March.\nOn 6 March 1946, the government publicly disclosed an outline of the pending Constitution. On 10 April, elections were held for the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth Imperial Diet, which would consider the proposed Constitution. The election law having been changed, this was the first general election in Japan in which women were permitted to vote.\nIn the process of passing through the House of Representatives in August 1946, the draft of the Constitutional Amendment was modified. This is called the Ashida Amendment, since the chairman of the committee at the time was Hitoshi Ashida. In particular, Article 9, which refers to the renunciation of armed forces, was controversial.\nThe phrase \"In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph,\" was added to paragraph 2 by Hitoshi Ashida without the diet deliberations. Although the reason is not clear, this addition has led to the interpretation of the Constitution as allowing the retention of force when factors other than the purpose of the preceding paragraph arise. Even now, there is a great debate over whether force for self-defense, such as the Self Defense Forces, is a violation of the Constitution.\nArticle 9.1) \u00a0 \u00a0Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.\n2) \u00a0 In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\nUnlike most previous Japanese legal documents, the constitution is written in modern colloquial Japanese instead of Classical Japanese. The Japanese version includes some awkward phrasing and scholars sometimes consult the English drafts to resolve ambiguities.\nThe MacArthur draft, which proposed a unicameral legislature, was changed at the insistence of the Japanese to allow a bicameral one, with both houses being elected. In most other important respects, the government adopted the ideas embodied in 13 February document in its own draft proposal of 6 March. These included the constitution's most distinctive features: the symbolic role of the Emperor, the prominence of guarantees of civil and human rights, and the renunciation of war. The constitution followed closely a 'model copy' prepared by MacArthur's command.\nIn 1946, criticism of or reference to MacArthur's role in drafting the constitution could be made subject to Civil Censorship Detachment (CCD) censorship (as was any reference to censorship itself). Until late 1947, CCD exerted pre-publication censorship over about 70 daily newspapers, all books, and magazines, and many other publications.\nAdoption.\nIt was decided that in adopting the new document the Meiji Constitution would not be violated. Rather, to maintain legal continuity, the new Constitution was adopted as an amendment to the Meiji Constitution in accordance with the provisions of Article 73 of that document. Under Article 73, the new constitution was formally submitted to the Imperial Diet, which was elected by universal suffrage, which was also granted to women, in 1946, by the Emperor through an imperial rescript issued on 20 June. The draft constitution was submitted and deliberated upon as the Bill for Revision of the Imperial Constitution.\nThe old constitution required that the bill receive the support of a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Diet to become law. Both chambers had made amendments. Without interference by MacArthur, House of Representatives added Article 17, which guarantees the right to sue the State for the tort of officials; Article 40, which guarantees the right to sue the State for wrongful detention; and Article 25, which guarantees the right to life. The house also amended Article 9. The House of Peers approved the document on 6 October; the House of Representatives adopted it in the same form the following day, with only five members voting against. It became law when it received the imperial assent on 3 November 1946. Under its own terms, the constitution came into effect on 3 May 1947.\nA government organisation, the \"Kenp\u014d Fuky\u016b Kai\" (\"Constitution Popularisation Society\"), was established to promote the acceptance of the new constitution among the populace.\nProvisions.\nThe constitution has a length of approximately 5,000 words and consists of a preamble and 103 articles grouped into 11 chapters. These are:\nEdict.\nThe constitution starts with an imperial edict made by the Emperor. It contains the Emperor's Privy Seal and signature, and is countersigned by the Prime Minister and other Ministers of State as required by the previous constitution of the Empire of Japan. The edict states:\nI rejoice that the foundation for the construction of a new Japan has been laid according to the will of the Japanese people, and hereby sanction and promulgate the amendments of the Imperial Japanese Constitution effected following the consultation with the Privy Council and the decision of the Imperial Diet made in accordance with Article 73 of the said Constitution.\nPreamble.\nThe constitution contains a firm declaration of the principle of popular sovereignty in the preamble. This is proclaimed in the name of the \"Japanese people\" and declares that \"sovereign power resides with the people\" and that:\nGovernment is a sacred trust of the people, the authority for which is derived from the people, the powers of which are exercised by the representatives of the people, and the benefits of which are enjoyed by the people.\nPart of the purpose of this language is to refute the previous constitutional theory that sovereignty resided in the Emperor. The constitution asserts that the Emperor is merely a symbol of the state, and that he derives \"his position from the will of the people with whom resides sovereign power\" (Article 1). The text of the constitution also asserts the liberal doctrine of fundamental human rights. In particular Article 97 states that:\nthe fundamental human rights by this Constitution guaranteed to the people of Japan are fruits of the age-old struggle of man to be free; they have survived the many exacting tests for durability and are conferred upon this and future generations in trust, to be held for all time inviolate.\nThe Emperor (Articles 1\u20138).\nUnder the constitution, the Emperor is \"the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people\". Sovereignty rests with the people, not the Emperor as it did under the Meiji Constitution. The Emperor carries out most functions of a head of state, formally appointing the Prime Minister and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, convoking the National Diet and dissolving the House of Representatives, and also promulgating statutes and treaties and exercising other enumerated functions. However, he acts under the advice and approval of the Cabinet or the Diet.\nIn contrast with the Meiji Constitution, the Emperor's role is entirely ceremonial, as he does not have powers related to government. Unlike other constitutional monarchies, he is not even the \"nominal\" chief executive or even the nominal commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF). The constitution explicitly limits the Emperor's role to matters of state delineated in the constitution. The constitution also states that these duties can be delegated by the Emperor as provided for by law.\nSuccession to the Chrysanthemum Throne is regulated by the Imperial Household Law and is managed by a ten-member body called the Imperial Household Council. The budget for the maintenance of the Imperial House is managed by resolutions of the Diet.\nRenunciation of war (Article 9).\nUnder Article 9, \"the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes\". To this end, the article provides that \"land, sea, and air forces, as well as another war potential, will never be maintained\". The necessity and practical extent of Article 9 have been debated in Japan since its enactment, particularly following the establishment of the Japan Self-Defence Forces (JSDF) in 1954, a \"de facto\" post-war Japanese military force that substitutes for the pre-war Armed Forces, since 1 July 1954. Some lower courts have found the JSDF unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court never ruled on this issue.\nIndividuals have also challenged the presence of U.S. forces in Japan as well as the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty under Article 9 of the Constitution of Japan. The Supreme Court of Japan has found that the stationing of U.S. forces did not violate Article 9, because it did not involve forces under Japanese command. The Court ruled the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty to be a highly sensitive political question, and declined to rule on its legality under the political question doctrine.\nVarious political groups have called for either revising or abolishing the restrictions of Article 9 to permit collective defense efforts and strengthen Japan's military capabilities. On July 1, 2014, the Cabinet of Japan approved a reinterpretation of Article 9 to allow the nation to engage in \"collective self-defense.\"\nThe United States has pressured Japan to amend Article 9 and to rearm as early as 1948 with Japan gradually expanding its military capabilities, \"sidestepping constitutional constraints\".\nIndividual rights (Articles 10\u201340).\n\"The rights and duties of the people\" are featured prominently in the post-war constitution. Thirty-one of its 103 articles are devoted to describing them in detail, reflecting the commitment to \"respect for the fundamental human rights\" of the Potsdam Declaration. Although the Meiji Constitution had a section devoted to the \"rights and duties of subjects\" which guaranteed \"liberty of speech, writing, publication, public meetings, and associations\", these rights were granted \"within the limits of law\" and could be limited by legislation. Freedom of religious belief was allowed \"insofar as it does not interfere with the duties of subjects\" (all Japanese were required to acknowledge the Emperor's divinity, and those, such as Christians, who refused to do so out of religious conviction were accused of l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9). Such freedoms are delineated in the post-war constitution without qualification.\nIndividual rights under the Japanese constitution are rooted in Article 13, where the constitution asserts the right of the people \"to be respected as individuals\" and, subject to \"the public welfare\", to \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\". This article's core notion is \"jinkaku\", which represents \"the elements of character and personality that come together to define each person as an individual\", and which represents the aspects of each individual's life that the government is obligated to respect in the exercise of its power. Article 13 has been used as the basis to establish constitutional rights to privacy, self-determination and the control of an individual's own image, rights which are not explicitly stated in the constitution.\nSubsequent provisions provide for:\nUnder Japanese case law, constitutional human rights apply to corporations to the extent possible given their corporate nature. Constitutional human rights also apply to foreign nationals to the extent that such rights are not by their nature only applicable to citizens (for example, foreigners have no right to enter Japan under Article 22 and no right to vote under Article 15, and their other political rights may be restricted to the extent that they interfere with the state's decision making).\nOrgans of government (Articles 41\u201395).\nThe constitution establishes a parliamentary system of government in which legislative authority is vested in a bicameral National Diet. Although a bicameral Diet existed under the existing constitution, the new constitution abolished the upper House of Peers, which consisted of members of the nobility (similar to the British House of Lords). The new constitution provides that both chambers be directly elected, with a lower House of Representatives and an upper House of Councillors.\nThe Diet nominates the Prime Minister from among its members, although the Lower House has the final authority if the two Houses disagree. Thus, in practice, the Prime Minister is the leader of the majority party of the Lower House. The House of Representatives has the sole ability to pass a vote of no confidence in the Cabinet, can override the House of Councillors' veto on any bill, and has priority in determining the national budget, and approving treaties.\nExecutive authority is vested in a cabinet, jointly responsible to the Diet, and headed by a Prime Minister. The prime minister and a majority of the cabinet members must be members of the Diet, and have the right and obligation to attend sessions of the Diet. The Cabinet may also advise the Emperor to dissolve the House of Representatives and call for a general election to be held.\nThe judiciary consists of several lower courts headed by a Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is nominated by the Cabinet and appointed by the Emperor, while other justices are nominated and appointed by the Cabinet and attested by the Emperor. Lower court judges are nominated by the Supreme Court, appointed by the Cabinet and attested by the Emperor. All courts have the power of judicial review and may interpret the constitution to overrule statutes and other government acts, but only in the event that such interpretation is relevant to an actual dispute.\nThe constitution also provides a framework for local government, requiring that local entities have elected heads and assemblies, and providing that government acts applicable to particular local areas must be approved by the residents of those areas. These provisions formed the framework of the Local Autonomy Law of 1947, which established the modern system of prefectures, municipalities and other local government entities.\nAmendments (Article 96).\nUnder Article 96, amendments to the constitution \"shall be initiated by the Diet, through a concurring vote of two-thirds or more of all the members of each House and shall thereupon be submitted to the people for ratification, which shall require the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast thereon, at a special referendum or at such election as the Diet shall specify\". The constitution has not been amended since its implementation in 1947, although there have been movements led by the Liberal Democratic Party to make various amendments to it.\nOther provisions (Articles 97\u2013103).\nArticle 97 provides for the inviolability of fundamental human rights. Article 98 provides that the constitution takes precedence over any \"law, ordinance, imperial rescript or other act of government\" that offends against its provisions, and that \"the treaties concluded by Japan and established laws of nations shall be faithfully observed\". In most nations it is for the legislature to determine to what extent, if at all, treaties concluded by the state will be reflected in its domestic law; under Article 98, however, international law and the treaties Japan has ratified automatically form a part of domestic law. Article 99 binds the Emperor and public officials to observe the constitution.\nThe final four articles set forth a six-month transitional period between adoption and implementation of the Constitution. This transitional period took place from 3 November 1946, to 3 May 1947. Pursuant to Article 100, the first House of Councillors election was held during this period in April 1947, and pursuant to Article 102, half of the elected Councillors were given three-year terms. A general election was also held during this period, as a result of which several former House of Peers members moved to the House of Representatives. Article 103 provided that public officials currently in office would not be removed as a direct result of the adoption or implementation of the new Constitution.\nPolitical parties.\nLegal status as a political party (\"seit\u014d\") is tied to having five members in the Diet or one member and at least two percent nationally of either proportional or majoritarian vote in one of the three elections of the current members of the National Diet, i.e. the last House of Representatives general election and the last two House of Councillors regular elections. Political parties receive public party funding (\u00a5 250 per citizen, about \u00a5 32 bill. in total per fiscal year, distributed according to recent national elections results\u00a0\u2013 last HR general and last two HC regular elections\u00a0\u2013 and Diet strength on January 1), are allowed to concurrently nominate candidates for the House of Representatives in an electoral district and on a proportional list, may take political donations from legal persons, i.e. corporations, and other benefits such as air time on public broadcaster NHK.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Marketed among the top luxury vehicle brands in the United States, Lincoln is positioned closely against its General Motors counterpart Cadillac. However, starting with the 2021 model year, they only offer SUV and crossover vehicles.\nThe division helped to establish the personal luxury car segment with the 1940 Lincoln Continental.\nLincoln Motor Company was founded in 1917 by Henry M. Leland, naming it after Abraham Lincoln. In February 1922, the company was acquired by Ford, its parent company to this day. Following World War II, Ford formed the Lincoln-Mercury Division, pairing Lincoln with its mid-range Mercury brand; the pairing lasted until the 2010 closure of Mercury. At the end of 2012, Lincoln reverted to its original name, Lincoln Motor Company. Following the divestiture of Premier Automotive Group (Jaguar, Land Rover, Aston Martin, and Volvo) and the closure of Mercury, Lincoln remains the sole luxury nameplate of Ford Motor Company.\nOriginally founded as a freestanding division above Lincoln, Continental was integrated within Lincoln in 1959. For 1969, the Continental-branded Mark series was marketed through Lincoln, adopting the Lincoln name for 1986. The Lincoln four-point star emblem is derived from a badge introduced on the 1956 Continental Mark II; the current version was introduced in 1980.\nThe current product range of Lincoln consists of luxury crossovers and sport-utility vehicles. Throughout its entire prior existence Lincoln also produced luxury car-based vehicles for limousine and livery use; several examples have served as official state limousines for Presidents of the United States. Today, this niche is filled from its crossover and SUV lineup.\nIn 2017, Lincoln sold 188,383 vehicles globally. Outside of North America, Lincoln vehicles are officially sold in the Middle East (except Iran and Syria), China (except Hong Kong and Macau), and South Korea.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistory.\nEarly years (1917\u20131930).\nThe Lincoln Motor Company was founded in August 1917 by Henry Leland and his son Wilfred. Among the founders of Cadillac, Leland had sold Cadillac to General Motors in 1909; staying on as an executive, he left in 1917 over a dispute with GM President William Durant regarding war production.\nLeland named Lincoln Motor Company after Abraham Lincoln, stating that Lincoln was the first President for whom he ever voted (1864). The company was financed by securing a $ contract to produce Liberty V12 aircraft engines for use during World War I. The Lelands broke ground on the Lincoln Motor Company Plant in Detroit. Lincoln Motor Company acted as the final assembly point for the engines, with the company securing parts from other manufacturers; cylinders were produced by Ford, with other parts sourced from Buick, Cadillac, Marmon, and Packard.\nIn total, Lincoln Motor Company would assemble 6,500 Liberty V12 engines by the end of World War I concluding production; by the end of the war, Lincoln would employ 6,000 workers.\nOn January 26, 1920, Lincoln Motor Company was reorganized as an automobile manufacturer, retooling its Detroit factory to produce automobiles. On September 16, 1920, Lincoln Motor Company produced its first automobile, the Lincoln Model L.\nLincoln Motor Company had struggled with the transition from military to automobile production, with some customers having to wait nearly a year for their vehicles to be completed from the time of purchase. By 1922, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy and was placed in receivership.\nUnder the influence of Edsel Ford, Lincoln Motor Company was purchased by Henry Ford for $ on February 4, 1922. While Lincoln was valued at $16 million, a $5 million bid by Ford was the sole bid received for the company (forced to be increased by the court).\nPurchase by Ford Motor Company.\nFollowing the purchase of Lincoln Motor Company by Ford Motor Company, Henry and Wilfred Leland remained at the company, with Edsel Ford given responsibility over it. While Ford had sought to expand its model range beyond the Ford Model T, the purchase of Lincoln held a degree of personal value, as the owners of Lincoln developed an automobile company from one that Henry Ford had been forced from. In 1902, a group of investors (led by Leland) forced Henry Ford from his second company, the Henry Ford Company; the company was reorganized as Cadillac (deriving its name from the founder of Detroit). With the exception of the engine, the 1903 Ford Model A and the 1903 Cadillac Model A share nearly the same design.\nPrior to the introduction of the Model T, Ford designed several higher-priced vehicles, including the 1904 Ford Model B, the 1905 Ford Model F, and the 1906 Ford Model K. Following its organization in 1908, General Motors began a rapid expansion of its automotive brands; by 1920, GM would outnumber Ford five to one. The purchase of Lincoln created a stand-alone luxury vehicle brand for Ford as Cadillac did for GM.\nWithin the first few months, relations between Ford Motor Company and Lincoln management began to break down; on June 10, 1922, the Lelands were forced to resign. As Edsel Ford began to take a senior role in the management of Lincoln, multiple changes were made to both the Model L and its production. The Lincoln factory was redesigned and expanded (to nearly 1,000,000 square feet), with the components of the engine upgraded for increased reliability and performance.\nAt its introduction, the Lincoln Model L gained a reputation for conservative (to the point of outdated) design. As a response, Edsel Ford introduced the Model L for 1923 in a custom-bodied form directly from Lincoln; in line with a Duesenberg or a Rolls-Royce, customers could also purchase a Model L with coachbuilt bodywork.\nFor 1923, Lincoln produced 7,875 cars (nearly 45% higher than in 1922). After struggling to deliver cars before 1922, Lincoln was operating at a profit by the end of 1923.\nIn 1924, a Lincoln Model L became the first state limousine used by a U.S. President on an official basis, supplied for Calvin Coolidge.\nBy 1930, Lincoln had succeeded in only a decade in what its chief competitors had taken 30 years to accomplish. Serving as a direct competitor to Cadillac, the Model L had become equal to vehicles from established American brands including Duesenberg, Marmon, Packard, Peerless, and Pierce-Arrow.\n1930s.\nDuring the production of the Model L, Lincoln did not adopt the common American automotive industry practice of yearly model changes. While the company had made minor revisions and upgrades to the model line to the chassis and powertrain, the body was largely left alone over its 10-year production, a business model shared with the Ford Model T. Lincoln found that customer interest was accommodated by the purchase of multiple Lincolns (or other luxury vehicles) in different body styles; as many Lincolns were custom-bodied from the factory or coachbuilt, yearly styling changes would not properly accommodate its customer base.\nFor the 1931 model year, the Model L was replaced by the Lincoln Model K. An all-new design (on a longer, lower chassis), the Model K introduced upgrades to the carburetor, brakes, and suspension. Competing against the Cadillac 355, Chrysler Imperial, Duesenberg Model J, and Packard Eight, the Model K offered both factory-designed bodies and coachbuilt designs.\nFor 1932, Lincoln introduced its first \"multi-cylinder\" engine, introducing a V12 engine for the Model K. The next year, the V8 was retired, making Lincoln the first manufacturer in the world to produce vehicles exclusively with V12 engines.\nFor 1935, Lincoln was positioned upward in price. While limiting sales, the move increased profitability per vehicle; at over $ for a factory body, the Model K competed against the Rolls-Royce Phantom II, Renault Reinastella, Duesenberg Model J, Mercedes-Benz Typ3 630 and the Cadillac V-12 (and V-16).\nLargely overshadowed by the Lincoln-Zephyr, the final Model K was assembled during 1939. The company has since not developed a direct successor to the Model K line.\nLincoln-Zephyr (1936).\nDuring the 1930s, Lincoln expanded to two model lines for the first time. Coinciding with the shift in market position for the Model K, Edsel Ford introduced the Lincoln-Zephyr as a sub-marque within Lincoln for 1936. Designed as a competitor for the (Cadillac) LaSalle and Chrysler Airflow, the Lincoln-Zephyr was priced between Ford and the Model K.\nThe Lincoln-Zephyr was the first Ford Motor Company vehicle to use unibody construction; while designed with a prow-style front-fascia, the model line was sleeker than the Chrysler Airflow. In contrast to its competitors, the Lincoln-Zephyr was powered by a V12 engine (a design separate from the Model K).\nThe model line was a success in the marketplace, selling over 15,000 units in its first year, amounting to a nine-fold increase over the previous model year.\nLincoln Continental (1939).\nIn the late 1930s, Edsel Ford began to consider American cars too boxy. In late 1938, to develop a European-style (\"Continental\") car for his next Florida vacation, he commissioned Ford Chief Stylist E. T. Gregorie to design a unique body design, using a 1939 Lincoln Zephyr Convertible Coupe chassis. After sectioning the body , the running boards were deleted and a spare tire was mounted behind the trunk lid.\nUpon his use of the one-off vehicle in Florida in 1939, Edsel Ford attracted a high amount of interest from potential buyers, often referring to its \"European\" or \"Continental\" exterior design. From the latter term, the one-off vehicle became known as the Lincoln Continental. For 1940 production, 404 vehicles were produced, with the first vehicle received by Mickey Rooney.\n1940s.\nFollowing the Great Depression, a number of American luxury car manufacturers were either forced into closure or reorganization; by 1940, alongside Lincoln, the American luxury-car segment largely consisted of Cadillac (who ended production of the LaSalle and V16 in 1940), the Chrysler Imperial (reduced to 8-passenger sedans and limousines), and Packard. To further secure the future for Lincoln, on April 30, 1940, Ford Motor Company reorganized Lincoln Motor Company as the Lincoln Division of Ford Motor Company. While previously operating as an autonomous entity, as a division, Lincoln structurally became similar to its major competitor Cadillac (within General Motors).\nAs part of the change, several changes were made to the Lincoln model line. Following the positive feedback of the 1939 Lincoln Continental one-off convertible built for Edsel Ford, the Lincoln Continental was introduced as a Lincoln-Zephyr production model for 1940. For 1941, Lincoln revised its branding; the hyphen was removed from Lincoln-Zephyr, making it a Lincoln. As a replacement for the expensive Model K, an extended-wheelbase Lincoln Custom variant of the Lincoln Zephyr was developed. Following the development of proper tooling, the Lincoln Continental began production on the assembly line, replacing hand-built construction.\nAfter the entry of the United States into World War II, as with all U.S. auto manufacturers, Lincoln ended automobile production as Ford Motor Company concentrated on wartime manufacturing. Following the conclusion of the war in 1945, the structure of Lincoln within Ford changed again, as the Lincoln-Mercury Division was created, pairing Mercury and Lincoln together; from 1945 to the 2010 closure of Mercury, the two divisions were paired together within Ford.\nFor 1946, Lincoln returned to production, ending the use of the Zephyr name. Code-named the H-series, non-Continental Lincolns were identified by their body style. Using slightly updated exteriors from 1942, the 1946 Lincolns continued the use of the Zephyr chassis. 1948 marked the final year of the Zephyr chassis (dating to 1936) and (as of 2023[ [update]]) the use of a V12 engine in an American mass-produced automobile. After 5,322 were produced (as both a Lincoln-Zephyr and Lincoln), Lincoln ended production of the Continental.\nFor 1949, all three Ford Motor Company divisions debuted their first postwar designs. Sharing its body structure with the Mercury Eight, the redesigned Lincoln model line (code-named the EL-series) marked the first use of a V8 in a Lincoln since 1932. An all-new V12 intended for Lincoln was stillborn in development, leading the division to adapt a Ford flathead V8 (from the Ford F-8 conventional truck). As with the previous Lincoln Continental, the 1949 Lincoln dispensed with running boards completely, moving on to abandon pontoon styling entirely, with a straight fender line (and low hood line) from headlamp to taillamp. In a carryover from Zephyr-based Lincolns, the 1949 Lincolns retained rear-hinged passenger doors. As a flagship model of Lincoln, the Lincoln Cosmopolitan was styled with its own rear roofline.\n1950s.\nAs Lincoln entered the 1950s, Ford Motor Company sought to increase the differentiation between the Mercury and Lincoln model lines. For 1952, to add interest to the brand, Lincoln returned to model names for the first time since 1942, with the Lincoln Cosmopolitan becoming the standard Lincoln model, with the Lincoln Capri becoming the flagship model line. In a return to (small) pontoon rear fenders, Lincolns shared a body with the Mercury Monterey. Mechanically, Lincoln differed from Mercury, as the Ford truck V8 was replaced by the Lincoln Y-block V8 with a Hydramatic transmission. For the first time since the discontinuation of the Model K, Lincolns were produced with front-hinged rear doors.\nFor 1956, the shared Lincoln-Mercury body underwent a redesign for the final time, with Lincoln adopting elements from the Mercury XM-800 and Lincoln Futura concept cars. Slotted above the Lincoln Capri, the Lincoln Premiere adapted features of the Continental Mark II, including its ducted air conditioning.\nDuring 1956, Lincoln-Mercury was reorganized slightly, following the creation of the free-standing Edsel and Continental divisions, Lincoln-Mercury was changed to Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (MEL), with Edsel slotted alongside/below Mercury and Continental above Lincoln, as the flagship of all of Ford Motor Company. By the end of 1959, Continental was integrated into Lincoln, and Edsel was withdrawn.\nThe Lincoln Motor Company Plant, built in Detroit, Michigan, by Henry Leland in 1917, was closed after 1952; subsequent Lincolns were produced alongside Mercury Montereys and Mercury Montclairs. For the 1957 model year, Ford opened Wixom Assembly in Wixom, Michigan, as a facility to specialize in Lincoln production. From 1957 until 2007, the facility produced Lincoln vehicles nearly exclusively, along with the Ford GT and several generations of the Ford Thunderbird.\nContinental Division (1956\u20131959).\nFor the 1956 model year, Ford Motor Company created the Continental Division, slotted above Lincoln as the flagship marque of Ford Motor Company. At its launch, Continental introduced the Continental Mark II as its model line, intended as a successor to the 1940\u20131948 Lincoln Continental personal luxury car. Offered as a two-door hardtop coupe, the Mark II broke from a number of American styling precedents of the time. While fitted with whitewall tires, the exterior was fitted with minimal chrome trim on the body sides; tailfins were left off of the body completely. In place of the bumper-mounted spare tire of the original Lincoln Continental, the trunk lid of the Mark II showcased the design element, with a large imitation spare tire bulge (which fit over the actual spare tire inside the trunk). The Mark II was largely hand-built, with extensive quality testing done on each engine and transmission before leaving the factory.\nIn place of establishing a separate sales and service network for Continental, the Mark II was marketed through Lincoln (the Mark II used a Lincoln engine and transmission). At $, the Mark II was the most expensive car produced by an American automaker at the time, rivaling the Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud in price.\nOn July 18, 1956, the Continental Division was integrated into Lincoln which continued to manage the Continental brand as a separate marque. During the 1957 model year, the Mark II was withdrawn, largely as a consequence of its hand-built construction; each unit was sold at a loss of over $. Subsequently, the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham overtook the Mark II as the most expensive American-produced vehicle.\nFor 1958, as part of a mandated $ reduction in price, Continental adopted the body of Lincoln, expanding into multiple body styles for the Mark III (the nomenclature indicating the transition). Adding a feature of the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, Continental adopted a retractable rear window across every body style (including convertibles) with a reverse-slant rear roofline. For 1959, the Mark III was renamed the Mark IV, becoming the Mark V for 1960.\nIn 1959, the Continental marque was formally brought to an end within Lincoln; for 1960, the Mark V was brought to production as the \"Lincoln Continental Mark V\", ending the model cycle alongside the standard Lincoln model line.\nUnibody vehicles.\nFor the 1958 model year, the Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln (M-E-L) division adapted new bodies across its vehicle lines. In addition to Mercury sharing its bodies with the premium Edsels (prior to the latter's demise), Lincoln and Continental adopted a common body structure, shifting to unibody construction. With a 131-inch wheelbase, the new platform would be among the largest vehicles ever built by Ford Motor Company; they are the longest Lincolns ever built without 5 mph bumpers, a regulatory mandate which went into effect in September 1972.\nAs a replacement for the Y-block V8, Ford developed a \"MEL\" V8 as standard equipment for Lincolns (which was also available in Ford Thunderbirds and some Mercury vehicles).\nFor 1959, Continental developed Town Car and Limousine variants of the standard four-door sedan. In place of extending the wheelbase, the reverse-slant roofline was replaced by a formal notchback configuration, allowing the rear seat to be moved rearward several inches. Among the rarest Lincoln vehicles ever produced, the Town Car and Limousines were only offered painted in black.\n1960s.\nFrom 1958 until 1960, Lincoln would lose over $. Following the recession economy of the late 1950s (a factor that would play into the demise of Edsel), Ford Motor Company was forced to recoup the development costs of a vehicle platform that Lincoln shared with neither Ford nor Mercury (with the lone exception of the engine and transmission). By 1958, the future of Lincoln-Mercury was at risk, with Ford President Robert McNamara considering the reduction of Ford to its namesake brand. As a condition of allowing Lincoln to continue production, McNamara required the Lincoln model line to undergo a reduction in size.\nFor 1961, Lincoln consolidated its model lineup to a single model line, with the Lincoln Continental replacing the Lincoln Capri and Lincoln Premiere; as the Continental marque was withdrawn, the Mark V saw no successor. While only nominally lighter than the 1960 Lincoln, the 1961 Lincoln Continental adopted a smaller exterior footprint, shedding 15 inches in length and 8 inches of wheelbase. In an effort to streamline production, only four-door body styles were produced, with the Continental becoming the sole mass-produced four-door convertible sold in North America; to maximize rear-seat egress, Lincoln returned to the use of rear suicide doors.\nIn another requirement to ensure its survival, the model cycle of Lincoln was extended from three years to nine years. While largely dispensing with major yearly model changes, the decision established design consistency and shifting resources towards quality control. For the 1966 model year, to better compete with the Cadillac Coupe de Ville and the Imperial Crown/LeBaron Coupe, Lincoln added a two-door hardtop to the Continental model line. After the 1967 model year, Lincoln ended production of the Continental 4-door convertible. At 5,712 pounds, the 1967 Lincoln Continental Convertible is the heaviest non-limousine car ever produced by Ford Motor Company; as of 2023[ [update]], it is the final factory-produced four-door convertible sold in North America.\nContinental Mark III.\nDuring the 1960s, Ford sought to develop a new flagship vehicle as a successor to the Continental Mark II. While the Lincoln Continental served as a close competitor to the Cadillac de Ville series and the Imperial, while Cadillac shifted the Cadillac Eldorado to the personal luxury segment in 1967, a segment that Ford exited in 1957 after the withdrawal of the Continental Mark II. As a response, in April 1968, the Continental Mark III was released as a 1969 model. While not officially a Lincoln, the Continental Mark III was marketed and serviced through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network. Over a number of various names considered for the vehicle, Continental Mark III was chosen, as Henry Ford II thought the Continental Mark II did not have a proper successor (thus restarting the nomenclature).\nAlongside the 1968 Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark III marked the debut of the Ford 385-series V8 rated at and torque and also became the first Ford vehicle to be fitted with anti-lock brakes. As standard equipment, the Mark III was fitted with power door locks, power seats, and power windows. To control development and production costs, the Mark III was offered only as a two-door hardtop derived from the chassis underpinnings of the four-door Ford Thunderbird. While sharing many styling elements from Lincoln, the Continental Mark III debuted many elements of its own, including hidden headlights and a redesigned trunk lid with a simulated spare-tire indentation (the actual spare tire laid flat in the front part of the trunk). It mixed European and American luxury features with the most prominent being an upright chrome grille inspired by a Rolls-Royce design and had a centrally mounted Cartier electric clock on the dashboard.\n1970s.\nWhile the Continental Mark III would bring Lincoln into the decade on a high note, for the American luxury car segment, the 1970s would prove tumultuous. Along with the introduction of federal safety regulations for American-market automobiles (which brought features such as 5-mph bumpers and the end of hardtop body styles), the 1973 fuel crisis would play a significant role in the engineering of American automobiles, forcing Lincoln to develop a compact-size sedan and redesign smaller full-size sedans for the 1980s. As Chrysler withdrew its Imperial brand after 1975, Cadillac became the sole domestic competitor of Lincoln.\nFor the 1970 model year, Lincoln made good on its 1958 plan to commit to a nine-year design cycle, giving the Continental its first complete redesign for the first time since 1961. During the 1960s, while sales of the Continental had remained relatively steady throughout its production, the engineering of luxury cars had begun to change among its competitors; to increase design commonality (and lower production costs), Cadillac and Imperial shifted away from brand-specific platforms (with the latter adapting to shared bodyshells with Chrysler). For the redesign of the Lincoln model line, the Continental grew in size. While sharing no visible body panels, Lincoln adapted the chassis of the Ford LTD/Mercury Marquis (shifting to body-on-frame construction for the first time since 1957). In another effort to maintain design consistency, the 1970 Continental was produced through 1979 with only gradual updates. Along with the mandated addition of 5-mph bumpers, in 1975, the roofline was redesigned (to visually differentiate the Continental from the Mercury Marquis).\nThe 1970s saw the introduction of several naming traditions within Lincoln. For 1970, the Town Car nameplate was revived on a permanent basis as a submodel of the Lincoln Continental. Following the use of a Cartier-brand clock on the Continental Mark III, in 1976, the Continental Mark IV began the use of Designer Editions, which saw use on subsequent Continental Mark series models and Lincolns.\nLincoln Versailles.\nDeveloped as a response to the popularity of the 1976 Cadillac Seville, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Versailles for the 1977 model year. Thirty inches shorter and 1500 pounds\u00a0lighter than a Lincoln Continental, the Versailles was based on the Ford Granada/Mercury Monarch (as the Seville was based on the Chevrolet Nova). Outsold by the Seville by a significant margin, the Versailles was discontinued in early 1980.\nWith a smaller design and engineering budget than General Motors, Lincoln stylists were unable to give the Versailles a different body design compared to the Cadillac Seville which received a unique body design on an improved Chevrolet Nova platform. Adopting many features from the 1975\u20131976 Mercury Grand Monarch Ghia, the Lincoln Versailles was given a Continental-style \"radiator\" grille, quad rectangular headlights (the first Lincoln since 1969 with exposed headlights), and a Continental Mark-style trunk lid with simulated spare tire bulge. However, the Versailles introduced two features to American-market cars: halogen headlights and clearcoat paint. The Versailles was later criticized for being one of the worst examples of badge engineering.\nContinental Mark IV and Mark V.\nFollowing the success of the Continental Mark III, Ford chose to develop a successor personal luxury coupe. For 1972, the Continental Mark IV made its debut, redesigned alongside the Ford Thunderbird. While sharing a common roofline with the Thunderbird, from the window line down, the Mark IV had distinct exterior sheet metal, with the return of a radiator-style grille, hidden headlights, and a redesigned spare-tire trunk lid. To distinguish itself from the Lincoln Continental, the Continental Mark IV featured full-height rear-wheel openings, precluding the use of fender skirts.\nFor the 1976 model year, the Continental Mark IV revived the concept of designer editions established by American Motors Corporation its own Designer Editions. Four versions were available as an option package with color, trim, and interior choices specified by fashion designers (Bill Blass, Cartier, Givenchy, and Pucci). Each carried the designer's signature on the opera windows and was fitted with a 22-karat (92%) gold-plated plaque on the instrument panel which could be engraved with the original owner's name. The concept was successful and would continue on other Lincolns until the end of the 2003 model year.\nFor 1977, Lincoln-Mercury replaced the Continental Mark IV with the Continental Mark V, a substantial exterior and interior revision of the Mark IV. At over 19 feet long, Mark V is one of the largest \"coupes\" ever sold in North America. In what would become a design theme for Lincoln into the 1990s, the Mark V used sharp-edged exterior styling with a center radiator grille. Following their 1976 success, the Mark IV adopted the Designer Editions option packages.\nWhile introduced following the beginning of downsizing among American vehicles, the Continental Mark V would go on to become the most successful of all the Mark series vehicles, with over 228,000 sold across three model years.\n1980s.\nAs Lincoln entered the 1980s, the American auto industry remained in the \"Malaise era\", struggling to balance fuel efficiency, emissions controls, and downsizing; the industry also found itself competing against European and Japanese manufacturers entering segments once dominated by Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler.\nAs a high point, after a ten-year model cycle, the Lincoln Continental underwent a complete redesign (downsizing for the first time), becoming the lightest Lincoln since World War II. Again sharing chassis underpinnings with Mercury and Ford, the Continental used the Panther platform of the Ford LTD and Mercury Marquis. Coupled with a shift to a V8, the fuel economy of the Lincoln model line rose nearly 40% in a single year. In contrast, the Lincoln Versailles was withdrawn early in the 1980 model year. As a result, by the end of 1980, Lincoln was marketing three versions of one vehicle. As a response, Lincoln split its two product lines, with the Continental becoming the Lincoln Town Car. After a short hiatus, for 1982, the Lincoln Continental shifted size into the mid-size segment (using the Ford Fox platform). While Lincoln would again compete against the Cadillac Seville (and to a lesser extent, Mercedes-Benz), the division completely erased any visual evidence of badge engineering.\nInitially planned for withdrawal in the mid-1980s until the stabilization of fuel prices mitigated fuel-economy concerns, the Lincoln Town Car progressed through the decade largely unchanged (as Ford was pouring resources into the development of the Ford Taurus). While the Town Car retained its traditional layout and large size, fuel prices dropped to a contemporary new low at the time, and operating efficiency became less of a concern to buyers than a decade prior. At the same time, Ford was also benefitting from rival GM having downsized most of their top-trim cars into largely-identical front-wheel-drive models. To capitalize on this, Lincoln introduced a series of advertisements from Young &amp; Rubicam in late 1985 titled \"The Valet\" which depicted a parking attendant and various well-off customers having trouble distinguishing Cadillacs from lesser Buicks (Electras) and Oldsmobiles (Ninety-Eights), leading to mass confusion; the owner of a Lincoln then appeared with the line \"The Lincoln Town Car, please.\" and drove off as everyone else present continued to squabble over the identical cars.\nThese ads faced some resistance from within Ford, but Edsel Ford II, then working at the Lincoln-Mercury division, backed them up. The ads debuted, and proved to be a not only a major success for Lincoln (dealers reported not being able to keep cars in stock enough to meet demand), but a major embarrassment for General Motors, whose Cadillac dealers began to complain of lost sales thanks to the ads. The problem was further aggravated by an embarrassing incident in 1986 at Detroit's Oakland University during a gala fundraising event attended by auto industry executives; after a sudden rainstorm moved in, cars belonging to the executives were driven by students (acting as impromptu valets) who called out the make of the car. One was a Cadillac, and people quickly began to shout \"No, it's a Buick!\" or \"No, it's an Oldsmobile\" in reference to the Lincoln commercials, and even shouted out brands that had not been mentioned in the ad (Pontiac and Chevrolet), leading to the gather crowd laughing and jeering as more and more identical GM cars were retrieved. This proved to be the final straw for GM, whose chief executive Roger Smith contacted then-Ford chairman Don Petersen, practically begging to have the ads taken off the air. Petersen complied.\nThe commercial campaign saw the emergence of the new advertising slogan for the brand, \"Lincoln. What a Luxury Car Should Be.\" which was used into the 1990s. Two (somewhat-contradictory) sequels to the first \"Valet\" ad aired in 1987 (one featuring a similar situation to the first ad involving white GM cars; the other involved the valet having a flashback to the events of the first commercial, only for the valet to be informed that one of the men involved had bought himself a Lincoln; his wife then commented that \"He finally listened!\") These series of commercials, however, were unable to turn around declining Town Car sales in the long-term. It was only after an all-new redesigned Town Car was introduced in 1989 for the 1990 model year that its sales at least temporarily rebounded.\nFor 1988, the Lincoln Continental underwent a second redesign. Splitting from the Mark VII, the Continental became the first front-wheel drive Lincoln and was based on an extended-wheelbase version of the Ford Taurus. The 3.8\u00a0L V6 engine also marked the first time that a Lincoln did not even offer an 8-cylinder engine. The new Continental was positioned against domestic rivals as well as marketed against European and Japanese-produced luxury sedans. Following the debut of a driver-side airbag in the Ford Tempo, the 1989 Lincoln Continental became the first domestic brand sedan sold in the United States equipped with standard dual airbags. Average annual sales for the new Continental were more than double that of the previous generation model and helped the Lincoln brand to achieve record total sales in 1989 and again in 1990.\nContinental Mark VI and Mark VII.\nFor 1980, the Continental Mark VI replaced the Mark V after only three years of production. Originally slated to downsize the Mark series into the mid-size segment (adopting the chassis of the Ford Thunderbird), Ford instead chose an intermediate step for the Mark VI, adopting the full-size Panther platform, with the model line sharing much of its body with the 1980 Lincoln Continental. Alongside the traditional two-door coupe (sharing its 114-inch wheelbase used by Ford and Mercury), a four-door sedan joined the Mark series for the first time since the 1958\u20131960 Mark III\u2013V models (using the 117-inch wheelbase of Lincoln). While sharing much of its body with the all-new Continental/Town Car, many design elements of the successful Mark V made their return, including hidden headlamps, opera windows, and (non-functional) fender louvers; vertical taillamps were joined by a distinct spare-tire decklid. Coinciding with its smaller footprint, the Mark VI saw the standardization of fuel-injected V8 engines (a first for the American auto industry) and the first overdrive 4-speed automatic transmission; along with computer control for the engine itself, the instrument panel replaced analog instruments with digital displays (introducing a trip computer).\nServing as the flagship of the Mark VI model line, the Signature Series trim was introduced for 1980; serving as the successor to the Mark V Collector's Series, the Signature Series included nearly every feature as standard equipment. In 1981, the Signature Series trim was adopted by the Lincoln Town Car (in various forms, throughout its entire production) and by the 1982 Lincoln Continental (for that year only). Slotted below the Signature Series, all four Designer Series options returned (for Mark VI coupes). For 1982, the series underwent a revision, moving the Cartier and Givenchy Editions (to the Town Car and Continental, respectively); the Pucci Edition became offered only as a sedan. The Bill Blass Edition was offered through all four years of production (and returned for the successor Mark VII).\nFor 1984, the Continental Mark VII replaced the Mark VI, sharing its chassis with the Ford Thunderbird, Mercury Cougar and Lincoln Continental. In an extensive shift away from its Malaise-era predecessors, the Mark VII placed a far greater emphasis on handling and performance capability (though not to the extent of a European grand-touring car), introducing four-wheel disc brakes (with anti-lock capability), four-wheel air suspension, and shared its 4.9L V8 with the Ford Mustang GT.\nIn contrast to its 1979 Mark V predecessor of five years before, the 1984 Mark VII had shed 27 inches of length and over 1,200 pounds of curb weight. Alongside the base model (dropped after 1987), the Mark VII was marketed in the luxury-oriented Bill Blass Edition (a Gianni Versace edition was also sold from 1984 through 1985) and the higher-performance Mark VII LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe). Coinciding with its mechanical commonality to the 1982\u20131987 Lincoln Continental, the Mark VII was offered solely as a two-door coupe.\nFor 1986, the Mark VII adopted the Lincoln brand name to end Continental branding confusion. The last generation of the Mark series sold with a Designer Series option, the Mark VII was produced through the 1992 model year.\n1990s.\nLincoln entered the 1990s nearly matching rival Cadillac in vehicle sales, but now faced competition from newcomers Infiniti and Lexus.\nFor 1990, the Town Car underwent a full redesign (after following the traditional nine-year Lincoln model cycle). As the model line represented over half of all Lincoln sales, a redesign of the Town Car proved risky, but was also mandated by passive-restraint requirements and fuel-economy improvements. Shedding its sharp-edged exterior lines to allow for a far sleeker exterior, the Town Car adopted many rounded styling elements from the Mark VII; traditional elements also returned, including a formal rear roofline, radiator-style grille, chrome trim, and C-pillar quarter windows. Delayed until the 1991 model year, the Lincoln Town Car marked the debut of the 210\u00a0hp 4.6\u00a0L Ford Modular V8 engine, the first overhead-cam 8-cylinder engine used in an American car since the Duesenberg Model J. Built on a revision of the Panther platform, the 1990 Lincoln Town Car shared its underpinnings (but no exterior panels) with the 1992 Ford Crown Victoria (dropping the LTD prefix) and Mercury Grand Marquis.\nTo meet federal requirements, Lincoln marked the debut of several safety features within Ford Motor Company and within the American luxury segment. Following the 1989 debut of dual airbags in the Lincoln Continental (1990 in the Town Car), antilock brakes (ABS) made their return on the Continental (1988) and on the Town Car (1992).\nFollowing the 1993 introduction of the Mark VIII (see below), the Continental underwent a redesign for 1995, introducing a new version of the Ford Taurus chassis. Styled closer to the Mark VIII, the Continental dropped its V6 in favor of a 4.6L V8 engine from the Mark VIII (tuned for front-wheel drive) to better compete with Japanese and European luxury sedans (in terms of power output).\nThe Lincoln model line underwent a significant transition for the 1998 model year. Alongside a mid-cycle revision of the Continental, the Town Car underwent a complete redesign of its body. The tallest Lincoln sedan in 40 years, the 1998 Town Car adopted the rounded exterior of the Mark VIII and Continental with a completely new interior. The Lincoln Navigator (see below) made its debut as the first Lincoln SUV, as the division fielded four model lines for the first time.\nBolstered by the launch of the Navigator, 1998 marked the first year Lincoln outranked Cadillac in vehicle sales (by over 4,500 vehicles). \nLincoln Mark VIII.\nFor the 1993 model year, the Lincoln Mark VII was replaced by the Lincoln Mark VIII. The first generation of the Mark series originally branded as a Lincoln, the Mark VIII remained a variant of the Ford Thunderbird/Mercury Cougar, shifting from the 1980 Fox chassis to the FN10 chassis (a Lincoln version of the MN12 chassis). Placing further emphasis on handling, the Mark VIII retained rear-wheel drive and adopted four-wheel independent suspension (with the Mark VIII and Thunderbird/Cougar as the only American-produced four-seat cars of the time with both chassis features). The body was streamlined further to modernize its exterior (relegating the spare-tire decklid to vestigial status). In massive contrast to its 1970s predecessors, the Mark VIII was given a cockpit-style interior, with all controls oriented towards the driver.\nAlongside a standard trim, the LSC (Luxury Sports Coupe) made its return as the flagship Mark VIII model; Designer Editions were discontinued. Though positively received by both critics and buyers, sales of mid-size luxury coupes were on decline during the 1990s. After the 1998 model year, the Mark VIII was withdrawn (outliving the Thunderbird and Cougar by a year). As of current production, the Lincoln Mark VIII remains the final generation of the Lincoln Mark series. In various forms, elements of the Mark VIII design were adopted by other Lincolns (the 1995 Lincoln Continental, the 1995 Lincoln Town Car interior, and the 1998 Town Car exterior) and other Ford Motor Company products (the Ford Windstar minivan interior).\nLincoln Navigator.\nFor 1998, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Navigator full-size SUV, its first new nameplate since the Versailles (outside of the Mark series), derived from the Ford Expedition (itself based on the Ford F-150). Developed as a competitor for the Range Rover, Mercedes-Benz M-Class, and Toyota Land Cruiser/Lexus LX450, the truck-based design of Navigator allowed increased cargo and towing capability over its competitors (rated at 8,500 pounds for 1999). The Navigator also offered standard third-row seating for up to 8 passengers (offered only on the Land Cruiser/LX).\nSharing no common bodywork with the Expedition forward of the windshield, the Navigator shared several design elements from the 1998 Town Car, including its use of body-color bumpers, chrome license-plate surround (the only chrome on the rear liftgate), and conservative use of chrome (primarily on the grille, door handles, and window trim); in modified form, the grille was later used on the later Lincoln LS and Lincoln Aviator.\nIn an extended debut model year, the Navigator became the second-most popular Lincoln vehicle behind the Town Car, selling 71,000 examples. In response, General Motors launched its own luxury-brand full-size SUVs, deriving the GMC Yukon Denali and Cadillac Escalade from the Chevrolet Tahoe.\n2000s.\nAs the division entered the 21st century, Lincoln began a period of major transition. In addition to ending production of the long-running Mark series, the Lincoln Navigator SUV had entered production, nearly unchallenged by European and Japanese manufacturers. As buyers of mid-size coupes in the luxury segments had shifted towards sports sedans, Lincoln developed an entry for the segment in the place of the Mark VIII. For 2000, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln LS mid-size sports sedan; coinciding with Premier Automotive Group (see below), the LS was developed alongside the Jaguar S-Type. Though the two vehicles shared a common chassis and related powertrain, no body panels were common between the two vehicles. The shortest Lincoln ever produced at the time, the LS was developed to compete with European and Japanese-produced counterparts, in line with the Cadillac Catera. While the Catera was imported from Germany (as a rebadged Opel Omega), the LS was produced alongside the Town Car and Continental in Wixom Assembly.\nFor 2002, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Blackwood, the first pickup truck produced by the brand and the second Lincoln manufactured outside of Michigan following the 1977\u20131980 Versailles. Derived from the Ford F-150 SuperCrew, the Blackwood was fitted with the front bodywork of the Lincoln Navigator and a model-specific pickup bed (with imitation wood exterior trim). In line with its name, all examples were painted black. The Lincoln Blackwood met with poor reception, due to its limited cargo capability (its pickup bed was effectively a carpeted trunk) and lack of four-wheel drive, leading Lincoln to discontinue the model after a single year of production.\n2003 marked a period of transition for the Lincoln model line, as both the Town Car and LS underwent mid-cycle updates (with the Town Car receiving a full chassis redesign), with Lincoln introducing the second generation of the Navigator. To complement the Navigator, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Aviator mid-size SUV. Sharing the body of the Ford Explorer with the Mercury Mountaineer, the Aviator adopted many styling elements from the Navigator, with a nearly identical interior design. While priced higher than its Mercury Mountaineer counterpart to avoid model overlap, the Aviator struggled to sell, as it competed closely against the Navigator sold in the same showroom. After 52 years of production, the Continental was discontinued for 2003.\nFor 2005, Lincoln introduced a second pickup truck model line, the Lincoln Mark LT. Again based on the Ford F-150 SuperCrew, the design of the Mark LT was partially derived from the poor reception of the Lincoln Blackwood. While still fitted with Lincoln Navigator bodywork and interior trim, the Mark LT was fitted with a standard pickup bed; the all-wheel drive was available as an option. Following lower-than-expected sales, the Mark LT was withdrawn from the United States in 2008; in Mexico (where the Mark LT was the highest-selling vehicle of the brand) Lincoln continued sales of the Mark LT through 2014.\nDuring 2006, The Way Forward restructuring plan (see below) began to take effect on Ford Motor Company, with the Lincoln LS ending production. To replace the LS, Lincoln introduced the Lincoln Zephyr for 2006. In what would be the smallest Lincoln sedan ever, the Zephyr was derived from the Ford Fusion mid-size sedan. In an effort to distinguish itself from its Ford and Mercury counterparts, the Lincoln Zephyr adapted styling elements from Lincoln vehicles of the past, including a wide rectangular grille (the 1960s and 1970s Continentals), wraparound headlamps (late 1960s Continentals), and twin-pod dashboard (early 1960s Continental).\nIn 2007, as another part of The Way Forward, Lincoln began a rebranding of its model line. As Ford considered the Lincoln Mark series to have high nameplate recognition, Lincoln began to introduce similar \"MK\" branding across the model lineup. For 2007, the Lincoln Zephyr was rebranded as the Lincoln MKZ (\"em-kay-zee\"), with the 2007 Lincoln MKX (\"em-kay-ex\") crossover SUV introduced. Originally slated to become the second-generation Lincoln Aviator, the MKX was the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Edge. Alongside the Lincoln Town Car, the Lincoln Navigator was not included with the MK rebranding; for 2007, it was redesigned alongside the Ford Expedition, marking the debut of the extended-length Navigator L. For the last time, a Designer Series Lincoln was produced, as Lincoln discontinued the trim on the Town Car after 2007. Produced only as a concept car, the 2007 Lincoln MKR marked the debut of the Ford EcoBoost V6.\nFor 2009, Lincoln introduced its first all-new full-size sedan since 1980, the Lincoln MKS. Intended to be phased in as the replacement for the Lincoln Town Car, the MKS was the Lincoln counterpart of the Ford Taurus. Built on a Volvo-derived chassis, the MKS was the first full-size Lincoln with front-wheel drive (or optional all-wheel drive); shared with the Ford Taurus SHO, a 3.5L twin-turbocharged V6 was an option. Derived from the 2007 MKR concept, the MKS marked the production debut of the \"split-wing\" grille, a design element similar to the 1930s Lincoln Zephyr. A year later, the division introduced the Lincoln MKT crossover SUV, a counterpart of the Ford Flex. Sharing its chassis with the MKS, the MKT was sized between the MKX and standard-wheelbase Navigator.\nPremier Automotive Group &amp; The Way Forward.\nAs Lincoln entered the 21st century, the brand underwent a major transition within the structure of Ford Motor Company. As Ford expanded its global automotive holdings during the 1980s and 1990s, it acquired Jaguar, Aston Martin, Land Rover, and Volvo Cars. To collectively manage its global luxury-vehicle holdings, in 1999, Ford organized Premier Automotive Group (PAG). The same year, the management of Lincoln-Mercury was shifted to the American headquarters of PAG, largely in an effort to engineer and market more competitive vehicles for the brand.\nThe integration of Lincoln into PAG would lead to several product changes within the division. Following the 2000 debut of the LS sports sedan, the Lincoln Continental was withdrawn in 2002. To avoid the model overlap that plagued the division two decades before, Lincoln chose to focus production on the Lincoln Town Car, one of the highest-profit vehicles of Ford Motor Company. During 2002, as part of a change of management, Lincoln-Mercury was removed from PAG and relocated to Ford Motor Company headquarters.\nIn 2005, Ford developed The Way Forward restructuring plan in an effort to return to profitability. Among the seven vehicle assembly facilities slated for closure, Wixom Assembly (home to all Lincoln assembly since 1957, with the exception of the Versailles, Navigator, Blackwood, and Mark LT) was placed third, with an announced June 2007 closure. After a shortened 2006 model year, the Lincoln LS ended production. Initially slated for discontinuation after 2007, production of the Lincoln Town Car was shifted to St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario, consolidated with the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis. In 2011, all three vehicles ended production, coinciding with the closure of that facility.\n2010s.\nFor the Lincoln division, the beginning of the 2010s introduced a number of structural changes. While Lincoln and Mercury were spared by The Way Forward, in 2010, Ford announced the closure of Mercury at the end of the year, with the final Mercury vehicle produced on January 4, 2011. After 30 years of production as a distinct model line (and 41 years as a Lincoln nameplate), the Lincoln Town Car ended its production run in 2011, coinciding with the closure of the St. Thomas Assembly in Ontario. In contrast to the V8-engined Lincoln Town Car, for 2011, Lincoln introduced the MKZ Hybrid, a counterpart of the Ford Fusion Hybrid. The first Lincoln hybrid vehicle, the MKZ Hybrid was the first Lincoln equipped with a four-cylinder engine. Following the discontinuation of the Town Car sedan, Lincoln continued the use of the Town Car nameplate, adding it to limousine and livery variants of the Lincoln MKT. Along with chassis modifications for heavy-duty use, the MKT Town Car features modified rear seating, with the third-row seat removed to create additional luggage space and second-row seat legroom.\nTo reflect the end of the Lincoln-Mercury division pairing (from 1945 to 2010), in December 2012, the formal name of Lincoln was changed to The Lincoln Motor Company (its name prior to 1940). To help differentiate Lincoln vehicles from Ford counterparts, Ford established separate design, product development, and sales teams for Lincoln. In a marketing shift, Lincoln began to target \"progressive luxury customers\", buyers who sought luxury without ostentation.\nAs part of the 2012 rebranding, for 2013, the Lincoln model line underwent several design revisions, headed by the release of the second-generation MKZ. Retaining commonality with the second-generation Ford Fusion, the MKZ adapted a distinct exterior from its Fusion counterparts (nearly unchanged from a Lincoln concept car released in 2012). The MKS and MKT underwent exterior and interior revisions, adopting the \"bow-wing\" grille design of the MKZ. Also during this time, Lincoln introduced new trim level nomenclatures Premiere, Select, and Reserve on the MKZ. The use of these trim names would eventually be expanded to other Lincoln models.\nIn 2014, Lincoln enlisted Matthew McConaughey as a brand spokesman; McConaughey has appeared in commercials for several Lincoln products in the years since.\nFor 2015, Lincoln introduced two new SUVs, with the all-new Lincoln MKC compact crossover SUV (derived from the Ford Kuga/Ford Escape) becoming the first Lincoln produced solely with four-cylinder engines. The Lincoln Navigator underwent an extensive revision, largely to preview buyers of its 2018 redesign. Along with extensive exterior and interior updates, the Navigator adopted the 3.5\u00a0L twin-turbocharged V6 of the Ford F-150 as its standard engine, becoming the first version of the Navigator offered without a V8 engine.\nFollowing the positive reception to a 2015 concept car of the same name, Lincoln revived the Lincoln Continental nameplate for the 2017 model year (after a 15-year hiatus). Slotted as a replacement for the Lincoln MKS, the Continental was adapted from a version of the Ford Taurus designed for China. While slightly shorter than the MKS, the Continental is the longest-wheelbase Lincoln since the Town Car. The revived model line introduced a new design language for Lincoln; shifting away from the split-wing grille, the Continental introduced a recessed rectangular grille. The revived Continental marked the debut of the Lincoln \"Black Label\" program for all Lincoln vehicles. As a flagship trim line, Black Label vehicles feature specially coordinated exterior and interior design themes (similar to the Designer Editions of the Mark series), along with highly personalized customer service.\nFor 2018, after an eleven-year production run of its predecessor, Lincoln released the fourth generation of the Navigator. Integrating the recessed rectangular grille of the Continental into its exterior, the Navigator is distinguished from the Ford Expedition largely from its taillamps and its blacked-out roof pillars (sharing the \"floating roof\" design of the Ford Flex and Ford Explorer). At a base price of $95,000, the Lincoln Navigator L Black Label is the most expensive vehicle ever sold by the Ford Motor Company (with the exception of the Ford GT supercars). The Lincoln MKZ underwent a mid-cycle redesign, adopting the grille design and twin-turbocharged V6 engine of the Lincoln Continental.\nFor 2019, the retirement of the \"MK\" naming scheme was expanded, as the MKX underwent a mid-cycle update, becoming the Lincoln Nautilus.\nTo commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Continental nameplate, Lincoln unveiled the 80th Anniversary Coach Door Edition. The wheelbase featured a 6-inch stretch to provide more rear passenger room along with longer roof, rear doors, and rear windows. The variant also marked the revival of the rear-hinged door configuration (after a 40-year absence). Cabot Coach Builders of Massachusetts provided stretch as well as rear door and interior conversion. A total of 80 units were made for 2019, but a 2020 version of the Continental Coach Door Edition was also available. The Coach Door variant is otherwise similar to the Continental's Black Label trim level with a twin-turbocharged 3.0 L V6 with four-wheel drive.\nThe MKT (including the MKT Town Car livery version) was discontinued in 2019, marking the final use of the Town Car nameplate.\n2020s.\nFor 2020, the Lincoln model line underwent further expansion, with the return of the Aviator mid-size SUV (again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer); the revived Aviator offers the first hybrid-electric system in a Lincoln SUV. The long-wheelbase coach-door Continental is now offered as a regular production model only in Black Label trim. The MKC was replaced by the Lincoln Corsair, remaining a counterpart of the Ford Escape/Kuga. Also in 2020, Lincoln announced that it was ending production of the Continental and MKZ sedans by end of the year due to the popularity of SUVs.\nWorldwide distribution.\nThe home market of the Lincoln Motor Company brand is the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Around the world, Ford Motor Company has used Lincoln in various markets as a flagship brand while using the Ford brand across its entire product line for other regions.\nAsia.\nIn Japan, Lincoln was marketed alongside Ford through 2016, when Ford ended its operations in the country.\nIn South Korea, the Lincoln product line continues to be offered. Previously excluded from the region, the Lincoln Navigator was introduced to the country for the 2022 model year.\nAustralia &amp; New Zealand.\nFord Australia has never marketed the Lincoln brand; to market vehicles in the premium/luxury segment, variants of Australian-designed and manufactured vehicles were marketed under the Ford brand (the Ford Fairlane and LTD; the Ford Fairmont served a role similar to Mercury) through Australia and New Zealand.\nChina.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, Hongqi (in an effort to develop a successor to the Hongqi CA770 limousine) began production of a license-built variant of the Lincoln Town Car, using knock-down kits imported from the United States. The Town Car CKD kits received an exterior restyling, fitted with different front fenders, headlamps and taillamps, and a new grille. Along with a standard-wheelbase sedan, three lengths of limousines were produced, along with the Hongqi CA7400 prototype.\nIn 2014, Ford Motor Company brought Lincoln to the Chinese market, introducing the brand with the mid-size MKZ sedan and MKC small SUV. By the end of 2016, Lincoln intended to establish a network of 60 dealerships in 50 cities, selling the MKZ, Continental, MKC, MKX, and Navigator. 2016 sales increased 180% over the previous year, with Lincoln planning to produce vehicles in China by 2019. To attract Chinese consumers, Lincoln introduced \"The Lincoln Way\", a car purchase and ownership model which provides highly personalized services to customers.\nOn March 29, 2020, the first Lincoln made in China (a Lincoln Corsair) was produced by Chang'an Ford at its facility in Chongqing. In 2022, a new Zephyr sedan built only for the Chinese market replaced the discontinued MKZ.\nEurope.\nFord of Europe does not market the Lincoln brand. To compete against luxury-brand automobiles, the Italian coachbuilder Vignale (acquired by Ford in 1973) is marketed by Ford of Europe as a sub-brand as the highest trim of the Fiesta, Focus, Mondeo, Kuga, Edge, and S-Max.\nMiddle East.\nFord markets the Lincoln brand in several Middle East countries, including Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and Bahrain.\nSales.\nLincoln achieved its two best U.S. sales years to date in 1989 (200,315) and 1990 (231,660). This followed the redesign of the Continental for 1988 and the Town Car for 1990. In 2023, Lincoln sold 81,444 vehicles, with about half of those sales coming from the Lincoln Corsair.\nBranding history.\nIn 1927, Lincoln adopted a greyhound as a hood ornament, used into the 1930s. As a replacement for the greyhound, Lincoln adopted a knight's helmet hood ornament, used before World War II. On the front fascia, Lincoln adopted a coat of arms with a red cross. Following the war, Lincolns adopted a rocket-style hood ornament until 1958.\nSince 1958, Lincoln has used a framed four-pointed star as its brand logo. Introduced on the Continental Mark II in 1956, the four-point star has undergone various modifications in appearance, but has remained nearly unchanged since 1980. Since 2018, an illuminated version of the front grille badge has been offered as an option.\nMark series (1968\u20131998).\nIntended as a successor of the 1956\u20131957 Continental Mark II personal luxury car, the Continental Mark III was the first generation of the revived Continental Mark series. Marketed as personal luxury cars, the Mark series served as the flagship of the entire Ford Motor Company range. Though marketed and serviced through the Lincoln-Mercury dealer network, Mark series vehicles did not carry Lincoln badging (with the exception of the four-point star badge, itself inherited from the Continental Mark II), with Ford officially using Continental as the brand name (later used for 1981\u20131985 Mark-series VINs).\nFor 1986, the Continental Mark VII was renamed the Lincoln Mark VII in an effort to end nomenclature and advertising confusion over the model line. The successor 1993\u20131998 Mark VIII would use the Lincoln brand name throughout its entire production.\nAlong with serving as a flagship model line, the Mark series offered Designer Edition option packages for the 1976 Mark IV. In 1982, Lincoln introduced its first Designer Edition vehicle, offering a Cartier Edition Town Car, offering the option through 2003. The feature of design-coordinated interiors and exteriors made their return in 2017 with the introduction of its flagship Black Label trim series.\nMotorsport.\nLike all American brands of the 1950s, Lincoln participated in NASCAR's Grand National Stock Car series, winning the first race in that series. Lincolns were campaigned in NASCAR through 1953.\nThe Continental Mark VII was raced in the Trans-Am Series in 1984 and 1985 without success, with the best result being a ninth-place finish at the 1984 Watkins Glen Trans-Am race.\nIn 1992, a Lincoln Mark VIII prototype was built as a land speed record car, setting the top speed record for a stock car with an engine under 5 liters at .\nThe Mark VIII was tested at Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1996 as a potential replacement for the discontinued Ford Thunderbird, but the car was rejected by NASCAR due to a lack of wind tunnel testing and not getting the serial numbers of the parts to ensure they were stock components, as well as Ford not wanting to give Lincoln, traditionally a luxury brand, a racing image; Ford ultimately replaced the Thunderbird with the Ford Taurus.\nPresidential state cars.\nFrom 1939 to 1993, Lincolns were included as official state limousines for Presidents of the United States, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to George H. W. Bush. Along with producing the first purpose-built presidential limousine, Lincoln produced the first armored vehicles for presidential use.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It separates the Gulf of California from the Pacific Ocean. The peninsula extends from Mexicali, Baja California, in the north to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, in the south.\nWith a length of , its width ranges from at its narrowest to at its widest point and has approximately of coastline and approximately 65 islands. The total area of the Baja California peninsula is .\nThe peninsula is separated from mainland Mexico by the Gulf of California and the Colorado River. There are four main desert areas on the peninsula: the San Felipe Desert, the Central Coast Desert, the Vizca\u00edno Desert, and the Magdalena Plain Desert.\nHistory.\nThe name of California existed as a myth among European explorers before it was discovered. The earliest known mention of the \"idea\" of California was in the 1510 romance novel \"Las Sergas de Esplandi\u00e1n\" by Spanish author Garci Rodr\u00edguez de Montalvo. The book described the Island of California as being west of the Indies, \"very close to the side of the Terrestrial Paradise; and it is peopled by black women, without any man among them, for they live in the manner of Amazons\".\nThe Baja peninsula was originally believed by the first Spanish sea explorers to be an island, and acquired the name California, after the mythical paradise. Following Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s's conquest of Mexico, the search for the fabled Strait of Ani\u00e1n connecting the Atlantic to the Pacific helped motivate him to send several expeditions to the west coast of New Spain in the 1530s and early 1540s. In 1539, explorer Francisco de Ulloa proved that Baja California was a peninsula rather than an island, and named the water separating it from the mainland the \"Vermillion Sea\" (sometimes referred to as the \"Red Sea\"). The Spaniards gave the name \"Las Californias\" to the peninsula and lands to the north, including both Baja California and Alta California, the region that became parts of the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. Over time the name \"Sea of Cortez\" replaced Vermillion Sea, and today the term \"Gulf of California\" is used by some.\nAlthough cartographers such as Abraham Ortelius showed the Baja as an extensive peninsula in his \"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum\", published in Antwerpen in 1589, and on the map \"Maris Pacifici\" from 1589, in the first half of the 17th century the idea of California as an island spread again; this persisted well into the 18th century, and was included in many erroneous maps that did not have the knowledge of the Spanish sailors about the Pacific coast of North America. It is believed to have originated with Carmelite friar Antonio Ascension, who around 1620 drew a map of California depicting it as an island, supposedly on a misconception of reports by Spanish navigators Juan de Fuca and Martin d'Aquilar. A copy of this map was sent to Spain and was seized by the Dutch on its way and then reproduced in the Netherlands, and eventually found its way to Henry Briggs in London who widely disseminated this misinformation. The first printed map showing California as an island was published by Briggs in 1622 (this map was also included in \"Hakluytus Posthumus\" by Samuel Purchas, 1625), where it was written that it was sometimes supposed to be a peninsula, but had since been shown by the Dutch to be an island. The idea was warmly accepted by cartographers and presented even in c.\u00a01720 on \"Carte Nouveelle de la Mer du Sud\", published in Amsterdam by Andries and Hendrik de Leth. Garcia and Jorge opined in 2023 that a reason for such a mistake could have originated in the secret in which the Spaniards held their cartography from other European powers' eyes.\nThe final blow to the notion of California as an island was struck by an influential map created by Italian Jesuit priest Eusebio Kino during his mission in the Pimer\u00eda Alta. It was titled \"Paso por tierra a la California y sus confinantes nuevas Naciones y Misiones nuevas de la Compa\u00f1\u00eda de JHS [Jes\u00fas] en la Am\u00e9rica Septentrional\" (\"Overland Passage to California and its Contiguous New Nations and New Missions of the Society of Jesus in Northern America\"). Originally, in 1695, it depicted California as a peninsula but based on the presence of blue abalone shells (most likely \"Haliotis fulgens\") from the Pacific coast in the Pimer\u00eda Alta, the information from natives, and his own travels and sightings, Eusebio Kino redrew the map in 1701. The map was printed in 1707 in Hamburg and Leipzig and became one of the best-known maps of northern New Spain. A notable colleague of Eusebio Kino who accompanied him on one of his major travels (in 1694) and acted as the intermediary in the publication of this map and dissemination of Kino's knowledge in Europe was Carniolan priest Marcus Antonius Kappus.\nGeology.\nThe Baja California peninsula was once a part of the North American Plate, the tectonic plate of which mainland Mexico remains a part. About 12 to 15 million years ago the East Pacific Rise began cutting into the margin of the North American Plate, initiating the separation of the peninsula from it. Spreading within the Gulf of California consists of short oblique rifts or ridge segments connected by long northwest trending transform faults, which together comprise the Gulf of California Rift Zone. The north end of the rift zone is located in the Brawley seismic zone in the Salton Sea basin between the Imperial Fault and the San Andreas Fault. The Baja California peninsula is now part of the Pacific Plate and is moving with it away from the East Pacific Rise in a north northwestward direction.\nAlong the coast north of Santa Rosalia, Baja California Sur is a prominent volcanic activity area.\nVolcanoes of the peninsula and adjacent islands include:\nResearchers from Scripps Institution of Oceanography have found a 2,000-year-old layer of non-decomposed roots, or peat, up to under the desert mangroves. The peat layer acts like a sponge for stored atmospheric carbon, a record of sea-level-rise is also recorded in the peat layer.\nThe desert mangroves restricted to rocky inlets on the rugged coast of Baja California have been growing over their own root remains over thousands of years to compensate for sea-level rise, accumulating a thick layer of peat below their roots. However, mangroves in flat coastal floodplains have accumulated a thinner peat layer.\nGeography.\nThe Peninsular Ranges form the backbone of the peninsula. They are an uplifted and eroded Jurassic to Cretaceous batholith, part of the same original batholith chain which formed much of the Sierra Nevada mountains in U.S. California. This chain was formed primarily as a result of the subduction of the Farallon Plate millions of years ago all along the margin of North America.\nClimate\nThe climate of Baja California peninsula is predominantly a hot desert climate, with the northern parts featuring a Mediterranean climate, and contains some dots of Mediterranean and hot semi arid climate along all of the peninsula.\nThe two most prominent capes along the Pacific coastline of the peninsula are Punta Eugenia, located about halfway up the coast, and Cabo San L\u00e1zaro, located about a quarter of the way north from Cabo San Lucas.\nThe Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno Bay, the largest bay in Baja California, lies along the Pacific coast halfway up the peninsula. The large Cedros Island is situated between the bay and the Pacific, just north of Punta Eugenia. Onshore southeast of the bay is the Desierto de Vizcaino, an extensive desert lying between the Sierra Vizcaino to the west, and the Tres Virgenes range which runs along the Gulf of California to the east.\nThe largest bays along the coastline of the Gulf are Bahia de La Paz where the city of La Paz is located, and Bahia Concepcion. The Bah\u00eda de los \u00c1ngeles is a small bay located west of the Canal de las Ballenas which separates the Baja California peninsula from the large island of Isla \u00c1ngel de la Guarda in the Gulf of California.\nEcoregions.\nThe peninsula is home to several distinct ecoregions. Most of the peninsula is deserts and xeric shrublands, although pine-oak forests are found in the mountains at the northern and southern ends of the peninsula. The southern tip of the peninsula, which was formerly an island, has many species with affinities to tropical Mexico.\nPolitical divisions.\nThe province of the Californias was united until 1804, in the Spanish colonial Viceroyalty of New Spain, when it was divided into Alta (upper) and Baja (lower) California.\nThe two Californias division was kept after Mexican independence in 1821. The Spanish Baja California Province became Mexican Baja California Territory, and remained a separate territory until 1836. In 1836, the Siete Leyes constitutional reforms reunited both Californias in the \"Departamento de las Californias\". After 1848, the Baja California peninsula again became a Mexican territory when Alta California was ceded to the United States (see 1854 map).\nIn 1931, Baja California Territory was divided into northern and southern territories. In 1952, the \"Territory of Baja California Norte\" became the 29th State of Mexico as Baja California. In 1974, the \"Territory of Baja California Sur\" became the 31st state as Baja California Sur.\nBaja California.\nThe northern part is the state of Baja California. It is sometimes informally referred to as \"Baja California Norte\", to distinguish it from both the Baja California peninsula and the adjacent state Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California are named \"bajacalifornianos\" (\"Lower Californians\" in English). Mexicali is the capital.\nBaja California Sur.\nThe southern part, below 28\u00b0 north, is the state of Baja California Sur. The citizens of Baja California Sur are named \"sudcalifornianos\" (\"South Californians\" in English). La Paz is its capital.\nTourism.\nThe peninsula is known colloquially as \"Baja\" by American and Canadian tourists, and is known for its natural environment. It draws ecotourists who go whale watching for migrating California gray whales as well as tourists that arrive to the resorts on the southern tip of the peninsula. Its location between the North Pacific and Gulf of California give it a reputation for sports fishing. Since 1967, the peninsula has hosted the Baja 1000, an off-road race that begins in Ensenada and ends in La Paz.\nIndigenous clothing.\nThe traditional/indigenous clothing of Baja California is a pivotal part of the vibrant culture of the peninsula. The area is home to five Yuman groups: the Cucap\u00e1, Kiliwa, Pai Pai, Cochim\u00ed, and Kumiai. Each group exhibits distinct clothing traditions deeply connected to their cosmovision.\nCucap\u00e1 (Water people): The Cucap\u00e1 use natural pigments derived from minerals for body paint, employing colors such as yellow, red, white, and black. Married women traditionally painted a red circle with two sidebars on their foreheads, while single women marked their foreheads with a cross. Men adorned themselves with piercings in their ears and noses and wore accessories such as bracelets, belts, and necklaces made from bones or feathers. Women traditionally wore skirts made from willow bark.\nKiliwas (Those who snuggle): Historically, the Kiliwa crafted clothing from the leather of animals they hunted. However, contact with other cultures has led to significant changes. While some continue to use traditional materials like \"manta\" fabric, contemporary Kiliwa clothing has incorporated more modern influences. Long hair, often braided, remains a common feature among some Kiliwa men and women.\nPai pai (Unbaptized people): The ancestors of the Pai Pai initially wore no clothing. Over time, women began wearing skirts and blouses made from willow husks, while men donned leather loincloths and went barefoot. Traditional adornments included leather ribbons and feathers. Today, Pai Pai women often wear ankle-length blouses and skirts or dresses, frequently accompanied by headbands. Men commonly wear long pants and shirts.\nCochim\u00ed (Foreigners/North people): Cochim\u00ed men traditionally wore little clothing, using ornaments made from reeds, shells, and snails. Women wore petticoats crafted from thin reeds woven with vegetable fibers and draped animal skins over their backs. They accessorized with belts at the waist and head coverings fashioned from netting. Footwear included sandals made from leather or \"ixtle\" fibers. Following the missionary period, Cochim\u00ed descendants adopted elements of cowboy culture, influenced by sustained contact with cattle and sheep ranchers of European and North American descent. This cultural shift significantly altered their clothing, architecture, and social practices.\nKumiai (Those of high places): In earlier times, both Kumiai men and women covered their bodies with the hides of animals they hunted. Deer hides were preferred for their size, while rabbit skins were valued for their warmth and were often used to make blankets for protection against the cold. Over time, the influences of modern civilization have significantly impacted Kumiai traditions, particularly among younger members of the community, who have gradually shown less interest in preserving their ancestral clothing practices. Today, Kumiai men typically wear long pants and shirts, while only older women continue to wear ankle-length dresses made from simple, pale-colored fabrics. Their hair is often styled in long braids.\nFlor de Cucap\u00e1: Flor de Cucap\u00e1 is the traditional attire of Baja California, created in 1954 as a symbol of cultural and regional identity for one of Mexico's youngest states. This iconic outfit was designed by Mar\u00eda de la Cruz Pulido following a state-wide contest organized by the government to represent Baja California's rich natural and cultural heritage. Inspired by the region\u2019s diversity, the attire consists of five pieces made of white cotton fabric, each imbued with symbolic meaning. The circular skirt features embroidered details of cacti and marine elements, representing the deserts and the Sea of Cort\u00e9s. The blouse includes an embroidered depiction of a woman with open arms, symbolizing the warmth and hospitality of the people of Baja California.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A gyroplane \"means a rotorcraft whose rotors are not engine-driven, except for initial starting, but are made to rotate by action of the air when the rotorcraft is moving; and whose means of propulsion, consisting usually of conventional propellers, is independent of the rotor system.\" While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's unpowered rotor disc must have air flowing upward across it to make it rotate. Forward thrust is provided independently, by an engine-driven propeller.\nIt was originally named the autogiro by its Spanish inventor and engineer, Juan de la Cierva, in his attempt to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds. He first flew one on January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airport in Madrid. The aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller. The term Autogiro became trademarked by the Cierva Autogiro Company. De la Cierva's Autogiro is considered the predecessor of the modern helicopter. The term \"gyrocopter\" (derived from helicopter) was used by E.Burke Wilford, who developed the Reiseler-Kreiser feathering-rotor-equipped gyroplane in the first half of the twentieth century. Gyroplane was later adopted as a trademark by Bensen Aircraft.\nThe success of the Autogiro garnered the interest of industrialists and under license from de la Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn &amp; Kellett companies made further innovations. Late-model autogyros patterned after Etienne Dormoy's Buhl A-1 Autogyro and Igor Bensen's designs feature a rear-mounted engine and propeller in a pusher configuration.\nPrinciple of operation.\nAn autogyro is characterized by a free-spinning rotor that turns because of the passage of air through the rotor from below. The downward component of the total aerodynamic reaction of the rotor gives lift to the vehicle, sustaining it in the air. A separate propeller provides forward thrust and can be placed in a puller configuration, with the engine and propeller at the front of the fuselage, or in a pusher configuration, with the engine and propeller at the rear of the fuselage.\nWhereas a helicopter works by forcing the rotor blades through the air, drawing air from above, the autogyro rotor blade generates lift in the same way as a glider's wing, by changing the angle of the air as the air moves upward and backward relative to the rotor blade. The free-spinning blades turn by autorotation; the rotor blades are angled so that they not only give lift, but the angle of the blades causes the lift to accelerate the blades' rotation rate until the rotor turns at a stable speed with the drag force and the thrust force in balance.\nBecause the craft must be moving forward with respect to the surrounding air to force air through the overhead rotor, autogyros are generally not capable of vertical takeoff (except in a strong headwind). A few types such as the Air &amp; Space 18A have shown short takeoff or landing.\nPitch control is achieved by tilting the rotor fore and aft, and roll control is by tilting the rotor laterally. The tilt of the rotor can be effected by utilizing a tilting hub (Cierva), a swashplate (Air &amp; Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, as seen in the McCulloch J-2, with twin rudders placed outboard of the propeller arc).\nFlight controls.\nThere are three primary flight controls: control stick, rudder pedals, and throttle. Typically, the control stick is termed the \"cyclic\" and tilts the rotor in the desired direction to provide pitch and roll control (some autogyros do not tilt the rotor relative to the airframe, or only do so in one dimension, and have conventional control surfaces to vary the remaining degrees of freedom). The rudder pedals provide yaw control, and the throttle controls engine power.\nSecondary flight controls include the rotor transmission clutch, also known as a pre-rotator, which when engaged drives the rotor to start it spinning before takeoff, and collective pitch to reduce blade pitch before driving the rotor. Collective pitch controls are not usually fitted to autogyros but can be found on the Air &amp; Space 18A, McCulloch J-2 and the Westermayer Tragschrauber, and can provide near VTOL performance.\nPusher vs tractor configuration.\nModern autogyros typically follow one of two basic configurations. The most common design is the pusher configuration, where the engine and propeller are located behind the pilot and rotor mast, such as in the Bensen \"Gyrocopter\". Its main advantages are the simplicity and lightness of its construction and the unobstructed visibility. It was developed by Igor Bensen in the decades following World War II, who also founded the Popular Rotorcraft Association (PRA) to help it become more widespread.\nLess common today is the tractor configuration. In this version, the engine and propeller are located at the front of the aircraft, ahead of the pilot and rotor mast. This was the primary configuration in early autogyros but became less common. Nonetheless, the tractor configuration has some advantages compared to a pusher, namely greater yaw stability (as the center of mass is farther away from the rudder), and greater ease in aligning the center of thrust with the center of mass to prevent \"bunting\" (engine thrust overwhelming the pitch control).\nHistory.\nJuan de la Cierva was a Spanish engineer, inventor, pilot, and aeronautical enthusiast. In 1921, he participated in a design competition to develop a bomber for the Spanish military. De la Cierva designed a three-engined aircraft, but during an early test flight, the bomber stalled and crashed. De la Cierva was troubled by the stall phenomenon and vowed to develop an aircraft that could fly safely at low airspeeds. The result was the first successful rotorcraft, which he named \"autogiro\" in 1923. De la Cierva's autogiro used an airplane fuselage with a forward-mounted propeller and engine, an un-powered rotor mounted on a mast, and a horizontal and vertical stabilizer. His aircraft became the predecessor of the modern helicopter.\nEarly development.\nAfter four years of experimentation, de la Cierva invented the first practical rotorcraft, the autogyro (\"autogiro\" in Spanish), in 1923. His first three designs (C.1, C.2, and C.3) were unstable because of aerodynamic and structural deficiencies in their rotors. His fourth design, the C.4, made the first documented flight of an autogyro on 17January 1923, piloted by Alejandro Gomez Spencer at Cuatro Vientos airfield in Madrid, Spain (9January according to de la Cierva).\nDe la Cierva had fitted the rotor of the C.4 with flapping hinges to attach each rotor blade to the hub. The flapping hinges allowed each rotor blade to flap, or move up and down, to compensate for dissymmetry of lift, the difference in lift produced between the right and left sides of the rotor as the autogyro moves forward. Three days later, the engine failed shortly after takeoff and the aircraft descended slowly and steeply to a safe landing, validating de la Cierva's efforts to produce an aircraft that could be flown safely at low airspeeds.\nDe la Cierva developed his C.6 model with the assistance of Spain's Military Aviation establishment, having expended all his funds on the development and construction of the first five prototypes. The C.6 first flew in February 1925, piloted by Captain Joaqu\u00edn Loriga, including a flight of from Cuatro Vientos airfield to Getafe airfield in about eight minutes, a significant accomplishment for any rotorcraft of the time. Shortly after de la Cierva's success with the C.6, he accepted an offer from Scottish industrialist JamesG. Weir to establish the Cierva Autogiro Company in England, following a demonstration of the C.6 before the British Air Ministry at RAE Farnborough, on 20October 1925. Britain had become the world centre of autogyro development.\nA crash in February 1926, caused by blade root failure, led to an improvement in rotor hub design. A drag hinge was added in conjunction with the flapping hinge to allow each blade to move fore and aft and relieve in-plane stresses, generated as a byproduct of the flapping motion. This development led to the Cierva C.8, which, on 18September 1928, made the first rotorcraft crossing of the English Channel followed by a tour of Europe.\nUnited States industrialist Harold Frederick Pitcairn, on learning of the successful flights of the autogyro, visited de la Cierva in Spain. In 1928, he visited him again, in England, after taking a C.8 L.IV test flight piloted by Arthur H.C.A. Rawson. Being particularly impressed with the autogyro's safe vertical descent capability, Pitcairn purchased a C.8 L.IV with a Wright Whirlwind engine. Arriving in the United States on 11December 1928 accompanied by Rawson, this autogyro was redesignated C.8W. Subsequently, production of autogyros was licensed to several manufacturers, including the Pitcairn Autogiro Company in the United States and Focke-Wulf of Germany.\nIn 1927, German engineer Engelbert Zaschka invented a combined helicopter and autogyro. The principal advantage of the Zaschka machine is its ability to remain motionless in the air for any length of time and to descend in a vertical line so that a landing could be accomplished on the flat roof of a large house. In appearance, the machine does not differ much from the ordinary monoplane, but the carrying wings revolve around the body.\nDevelopment of the autogyro continued in the search for a means to accelerate the rotor before takeoff (called prerotating). Rotor drives initially took the form of a rope wrapped around the rotor axle and then pulled by a team of men to accelerate the rotor\u00a0\u2013\u00a0this was followed by a long taxi to bring the rotor up to speed sufficient for takeoff. The next innovation was flaps on the tail to redirect the propeller slipstream into the rotor while on the ground. This design was first tested on a C.19 in 1929. Efforts in 1930 had shown that the development of a light and efficient mechanical transmission was not a trivial undertaking. In 1932 the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, United States solved this problem with a transmission driven by the engine.\nBuhl Aircraft Company produced its Buhl A-1, the first autogyro with a propulsive rear motor, designed by Etienne Dormoy and meant for aerial observation (motor behind pilot and camera). It had its maiden flight on 15December 1931.\nDe la Cierva's early autogyros were fitted with fixed rotor hubs, small fixed wings, and control surfaces like those of a fixed-wing aircraft. At low airspeeds, the control surfaces became ineffective and could readily lead to loss of control, particularly during landing. In response, de la Cierva developed a direct control rotor hub, which could be tilted in any direction by the pilot. De la Cierva's direct control was first developed on the Cierva C.19 Mk.V and saw the production on the Cierva C.30 series of 1934. In March 1934, this type of autogyro became the first rotorcraft to take off and land on the deck of a ship, when a C.30 performed trials on board the Spanish navy seaplane tender \"D\u00e9dalo\" off Valencia.\nLater that year, during the leftist Asturias revolt in October, an autogyro made a reconnaissance flight for the loyal troops, marking the first military employment of a rotorcraft.\nWhen improvements in helicopters made them practical, autogyros became largely neglected. Also, they were susceptible to ground resonance. They were, however, used in the 1930s by major newspapers, and by the United States Postal Service for the mail service between cities in the northeast.\nWinter War.\nDuring the Winter War of 1939\u20131940, the Red Army Air Force used armed Kamov A-7 autogyros to provide fire correction for artillery batteries, carrying out20 combat flights. The A-7 was the first rotary-wing aircraft designed for combat, armed with one 7.62\u00d754mmR PV-1 machine gun, a pair of Degtyaryov machine guns, and six RS-82 rockets or four FAB-100 bombs.\nWorld War II.\nThe Avro Rota autogyro, a military version of the Cierva C.30, was used by the Royal Air Force to calibrate coastal radar stations during and after the Battle of Britain.\nIn World War II, Germany pioneered a very small gyroglider rotor kite, the Focke-Achgelis Fa 330 \"Bachstelze\" (wagtail), towed by U-boats to provide aerial surveillance.\nThe Imperial Japanese Army developed the Kayaba Ka-1 autogyro for reconnaissance, artillery-spotting, and anti-submarine uses. The Ka-1 was based on the Kellett KD-1 first imported to Japan in 1938. The craft was initially developed for use as an observation platform and for artillery spotting duties. The army liked the craft's short take-off span, and especially its low maintenance requirements. Production began in 1941, with the machines assigned to artillery units for spotting the fall of shells. These carried two crewmen: a pilot and a spotter.\nLater, the Japanese Army commissioned two small aircraft carriers intended for coastal antisubmarine (ASW) duties. The spotter's position on the Ka-1 was modified to carry one small depth charge. Ka-1 ASW autogyros operated from shore bases as well as the two small carriers. They appear to have been responsible for at least one submarine sinking.\nWith the beginning of German invasion in USSR June 1941, the Soviet Air Force organized new courses for training Kamov A-7 aircrew and ground support staff. In August 1941, per the decision of the chief artillery directorate of the Red Army, based on the trained flight group and five combat-ready A-7 autogyros, the 1st autogyro artillery spotting aircraft squadron was formed, which was included in the strength of the 24th Army of the Soviet Air Force, combat active in the area around Elnya near Smolensk. From 30August to 5October 1941 the autogyros made19 combat sorties for artillery spotting. Not one autogyro was lost in action, while the unit was disbanded in 1942 due to the shortage of serviceable aircraft.\nPostwar developments.\nThe autogyro was resurrected after World WarII when Dr. Igor Bensen, a Russian immigrant in the United States, saw a captured German U-boat's Fa330 gyroglider and was fascinated by its characteristics. At work, he was tasked with the analysis of the British military Rotachute gyro glider designed by an expatriate Austrian, Raoul Hafner. This led him to adapt the design for his purposes and eventually market the Bensen B-7 in 1955. Bensen submitted an improved version, the Bensen B-8M, for testing to the United States Air Force, which designated it the X-25. The B-8M was designed to use surplus McCulloch engines used on flying unmanned target drones.\nKen Wallis developed a miniature autogyro craft, the \"Wallis\" autogyro, in England in the 1960s, and autogyros built similar to Wallis' design appeared for many years. Ken Wallis' designs have been used in various scenarios, including military training, police reconnaissance, and in a search for the Loch Ness Monster, as well as an appearance in the 1967 James Bond movie \"You Only Live Twice\".\nThree different autogyro designs have been certified by the Federal Aviation Administration for commercial production: the Umbaugh U-18/Air &amp; Space 18A of 1965, the Avian 2/180 Gyroplane of 1967, and the McCulloch J-2 of 1972. All have been commercial failures, for various reasons.\nThe Kaman KSA-100 SAVER (Stowable Aircrew Vehicle Escape Rotorseat) is an aircraft-stowable gyroplane escape device designed and built for the United States Navy. Designed to be installed in naval combat aircraft as part of the ejection sequence, only one example was built and it did not enter service. It was powered by a Williams WRC-19 turbofan making it the first jet-powered autogyro.\nBensen Gyrocopter.\nThe basic Bensen \"Gyrocopter\" design is a simple frame of square aluminium or galvanized steel tubing, reinforced with triangles of lighter tubing. It is arranged so that the stress falls on the tubes, or special fittings, not the bolts. Afront-to-back keel mounts a steerable nosewheel, seat, engine, and vertical stabilizer. Outlying mainwheels are mounted on an axle. Some versions may mount seaplane-style floats for water operations.\nBensen-type autogyros use a pusher configuration for simplicity and to increase visibility for the pilot. Power can be supplied by a variety of engines. McCulloch drone engines, Rotax marine engines, Subaru automobile engines, and other designs have been used in Bensen-type designs.\nThe rotor is mounted atop the vertical mast. The rotor system of all Bensen-type autogyros is of a two-blade teetering design. There are some disadvantages associated with this rotor design, but the simplicity of the rotor design lends itself to ease of assembly and maintenance and is one of the reasons for its popularity. Aircraft-quality birch was specified in early Bensen designs, and a wood/steel composite is used in the world-speed-record-holding Wallis design. Gyroplane rotor blades are made from other materials such as aluminium and GRP-based composite.\nBensen's success triggered several other designs, some of them fatally flawed with an offset between the centre of gravity and thrust line, risking a power push-over (PPO or buntover) causing the death of the pilot and giving gyroplanes, in general, a poor reputation\u2014in contrast to de la Cierva's original intention and early statistics. Most new autogyros are now safe from PPO.\n21st-century development and use.\nIn 2002, a Groen Brothers Aviation's Hawk\u00a04 provided perimeter patrol for the Winter Olympics and Paralympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. The aircraft completed 67missions and accumulated 75hours of maintenance-free flight time during its 90-day operational contract.\nWorldwide, over 1,000 autogyros are used by authorities for military and law enforcement. The first U.S. police authorities to evaluate an autogyro were the Tomball, Texas, police, on a $40,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Justice together with city funds, costing much less than a helicopter to buy ($75,000) and operate ($50/hour). Although it is able to land in 40-knot crosswinds, a minor accident happened when the rotor was not kept under control in a wind gust.\nSince 2009, several projects in Iraqi Kurdistan have been realized. In 2010, the first autogyro was handed over to the Kurdish Minister of Interiors, Mr. Karim Sinjari. The project for the interior ministry was to train pilots to control and monitor the approach and takeoff paths of the airports in Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk to prevent terrorist encroachments. The gyroplane pilots also form the backbone of the pilot crew of the Kurdish police, who are trained to pilot on Eurocopter EC\u00a0120\u00a0B helicopters.\nIn18 months from 2009 to 2010, the German pilot couple Melanie and Andreas St\u00fctzfor undertook the first world tour by autogyro, in which they flew several different gyroplane types in Europe, southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and South America. The adventure was documented in the book \"WELTFLUG\u00a0\u2013\u00a0The Gyroplane Dream\" and in the film \"Weltflug.tv\u00a0\u2013The Gyrocopter World Tour\".\nUnmanned autogyros.\nWhile most autogyros have historically been manned, recent decades have seen the development of unmanned autogyros for specialized applications. These unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) leverage the simplicity and stability of the autogyro configuration while eliminating the need for onboard pilots, making them suitable for missions in hazardous flight conditions.\nThe MMIST CQ-10 SnowGoose was among the earliest examples, designed for cargo delivery in military operations. Later developments, such as the BAE Systems Ampersand, explored reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities using an optionally piloted autogyro.\nIn the scientific domain, the ThunderFly TF-G2 represents a modern autogyro UAV designed for atmospheric research. It is used for atmospheric profiling and meteorological data collection, particularly in conditions unsuitable for conventional fixed-wing UAVs.\nHelicopter autogyration.\nWhile autogyros are not helicopters, helicopters are capable of autorotation. If a helicopter suffers a power failure, the pilot can adjust the collective pitch to keep the rotor spinning generating enough lift to touch down and skid in a relatively soft landing via autorotation of its rotor disc.\nCertification by national aviation authorities.\nUnited Kingdom certification.\nSome autogyros, such as the Rotorsport MT03, MTO Sport (open tandem), and Calidus (enclosed tandem), and the Magni Gyro M16C (open tandem) and M24 (enclosed side by side) have type approval by the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) under British Civil Airworthiness Requirements CAP643 SectionT.\nOthers operate under a permit to fly issued by the Popular Flying Association similar to theU.S. experimental aircraft certification. However, the CAA's assertion that autogyros have a poor safety record means that a permit to fly will be granted only to existing types of an autogyro. All new types of autogyro must be submitted for full type approval under CAP643 SectionT. The CAA allows gyro flight over congested areas.\nIn 2005, the CAA issued a mandatory permit directive (MPD) which restricted operations for single-seat autogyros and were subsequently integrated into CAP643 Issue 3 published on 12August 2005. The restrictions are concerned with the offset between the centre of gravity and thrust line and apply to all aircraft unless evidence is presented to the CAA that the CG/Thrust Line offset is less than 2\u00a0inches (5\u00a0cm) in either direction. The restrictions are summarised as follows:\nThese restrictions do \"not\" apply to autogyros with type approval under CAA CAP643 Section T, which are subject to the operating limits specified in the type approval.\nUnited States certification.\nA certificated autogyro must meet mandated stability and control criteria; in the United States these are outlined in \"Federal Aviation Regulations Part 27: Airworthiness Standards: Normal Category Rotorcraft\".\nThe U.S. Federal Aviation Administration issues a Standard Airworthiness Certificate to qualified autogyros. Amateur-built or kit-built aircraft are operated under a Special Airworthiness Certificate in the Experimental category. Per FAR 1.1, the FAA uses the term \"gyroplane\" for all autogyros, regardless of the type of airworthiness certificate.\nWorld records.\nIn 1931, Amelia Earhart (U.S.) flew a Pitcairn PCA-2 to a women's world altitude record of 18,415\u00a0ft (5,613\u00a0m).\nWing Commander Ken Wallis (U.K.) held most of the autogyro world records during his autogyro flying career. These include a time-to-climb, a speed record of 189\u00a0km/h (111.7\u00a0mph), and the straight-line distance record of . On 16November 2002, at 89 years of age, Wallis increased the speed record to 207.7\u00a0km/h (129.1\u00a0mph) \u2013 and simultaneously set another world record as the oldest pilot to set a world record.\nUntil 2019, the autogyro was one of the last remaining types of aircraft which had not yet circumnavigated the globe. The 2004 Expedition Global Eagle was the first attempt to do so using an autogyro. The expedition set the record for the longest flight over water by an autogyro during the segment from Muscat, Oman, to Karachi. The attempt was finally abandoned because of bad weather after having covered .\nAs of 2014[ [update]], Andrew Keech (U.S.) holds several records. He made a transcontinental flight in his self-built Little Wing Autogyro \"Woodstock\" from Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, to San Diego, California, in October 2003, breaking the record set 72years earlier by Johnny Miller in a Pitcairn PCA-2. He also set three world records for speed over a recognized course. On 9February 2006 he broke two of his world records and set a record for distance, ratified by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI): Speed over a closed circuit of without payload: , speed over a closed circuit of without payload: , and distance over a closed circuit without landing: .\nOn 7 November 2015, the Italian astrophysicist and pilot Donatella Ricci took off with a MagniGyro M16 from the Caposile aerodrome in Venice, aiming to set a new altitude world record. She reached an altitude of 8,138.46\u00a0m (26,701\u00a0ft), breaking the women's world altitude record held for 84years by Amelia Earhart. The following day, she increased the altitude by a further 261\u00a0m, reaching 8,399\u00a0m (27,556\u00a0ft), setting the new altitude world record with an autogyro. She improved by 350\u00a0m (+4.3%) the preceding record established by Andrew Keech in 2004.\nNorman Surplus, from Larne in Northern Ireland, became the second person to attempt a world circumnavigation by gyroplane/autogyro type aircraft on 22March 2010, flying a Rotorsport UK MT-03 Autogyro, registered G-YROX. Surplus was unable to get permission to enter Russian airspace from Japan, but he established nine world autogyro records on his flight between Northern Ireland and Japan between 2010 and 2011. FAI world records for autogyro flight.\nG-YROX was delayed (by the Russian impasse) in Japan for over three years before being shipped across the Pacific to the state of Oregon, United States. From 1June 2015, Surplus flew from McMinnville, Oregon, across the continental United States, through northern Canada/Greenland, and in late July/August made the first crossing of the North Atlantic by autogyro aircraft to land back in Larne, Northern Ireland on 11August 2015. He established a further ten FAI World Records during this phase of the circumnavigation flight.\nAfter a nine-year wait (since 2010), permission to fly U.K. registered gyroplanes through the Russian Federation was finally approved, and on 22April 2019, Surplus and G-YROX continued eastwards from Larne, Northern Ireland, to cross Northern Europe and rendezvous with fellow gyroplane pilot James Ketchell piloting Magni M16 Gyroplane G-KTCH. Flying in loose formation the two aircraft made the first Trans-Russia flight by gyroplane together to reach the Bering Sea. To cross the Bering Strait, the two aircraft took off from Provideniya Bay, Russia on 7June 2019 and landed at Nome, Alaska on 6June having also made the first gyroplane crossing of the International Date Line. After crossing Alaska and western Canada, on 28June 2019, Surplus piloting G-YROX, became the first person to circumnavigate the world in a gyroplane upon returning to the Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum, McMinnville, Oregon, U.S.\nOver the nine years it had taken Surplus to complete the task, G-YROX flew through 32countries.\nThe first physical circumnavigation of the globe by an Autogyro, Oregon to Oregon, had taken Surplus and G-YROX, four years and 28 days to complete, after being dogged by long diplomatic delays in gaining the necessary permission to fly across Russian Federation Airspace. However, as the flight had been severely stalled and interrupted en-route by lengthy delays it was no longer deemed eligible for setting a first, continuously flown, speed record around the world and so this task was then left to James Ketchell to complete, by setting a first official speed record flight around the world for an Autogyro type aircraft, some three months later.\nSubsequently, on 22September 2019, Ketchell was awarded the world record from the Guinness World Records as the first circumnavigation of the world in an autogyro and from the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale for the first certified \"Speed around the World, Eastbound\" circumnavigation in an E-3a Autogyro. He completed his journey in 175 days.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Constitution was drafted following the surrender of Japan in World War II. It came into effect on 3 May 1947 during the occupation of Japan by the Allies, which lasted until 28 April 1952. In its text, the state formally renounces the sovereign right of belligerency and aims at an international peace based on justice and order. The article also states that, to accomplish these aims, armed forces with war potential will not be maintained. The Constitution was imposed by U.S. military occupation (Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers) to prevent rearmament of Japan in the post\u2013World War II period. This condition was a similar prohibition placed on post-war Germany, to be overseen by the United Kingdom, after World War I. However, Germany remilitarized anyway in the decades following despite this prohibition under the Weimar Republic and later Adolf Hitler's regime. This was a leading call for the Allied mandate, and the continuing US defense agreements that would render aid in maintaining Japanese sovereignty in the event of a foreign attack.\nThere are the post-occupation U.S. military stationed in Japan under the U.S.\u2013Japan Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaty and Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) which was founded in 1954 as \"de facto\" postwar Japanese military. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe approved a reinterpretation which gave more powers to the JSDF in 2014, which was passed by the Legislation for Peace and Security in 2015.\nText of the article.\nThe full text of the article in Japanese:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe official English translation of the article is:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Article 9. Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.&lt;br&gt;In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized.\nHistorical background.\nThe failure of the collective security of the League of Nations led to the realization that a universal system of security could only be effective if nations agreed to some limitation of their national sovereignty with regard to their right to belligerency, and if the Security Council which had been a \"closed shop\" during League of Nations times, would open itself up to U.N. Members who would cede constitutional powers in favor of collective security. Like the German Article 24, which was incorporated in the post-war German Constitution, and which provides for delegating or limiting sovereign powers in favor of collective security, Article 9 was added to the 1947 constitution during the occupation that lasted until 28 April 1952 following the defeat of Japan in the World War II.\nThe source of the pacifist clause is disputed. According to the Allied Supreme Commander Douglas MacArthur (in statements made at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to re-arm), the provision was suggested by Prime Minister Kij\u016br\u014d Shidehara, who \"wanted it to prohibit any military establishment for Japan\u2014any military establishment whatsoever\". Shidehara's perspective was that retention of arms would be \"meaningless\" for the Japanese in the post-war era, because any substandard post-war military would no longer gain the respect of the people, and would actually cause people to obsess with the subject of rearming Japan. Shidehara admitted to his authorship in his memoirs \"Gaik\u014d Goj\u016b-Nen\" (\"Fifty Years' Diplomacy\"), published in 1951, where he described how the idea came to him on a train journey to Tokyo; MacArthur himself confirmed Shidehara's authorship on several occasions. However, according to some interpretations, he denied having done so, and the inclusion of Article 9 was mainly brought about by the members of the Government Section of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, especially Charles Kades, one of Douglas MacArthur's closest associates. There is, however, another theory by constitutional scholar Toshiyoshi Miyazawa, which is supported by significant evidence provided by other historians, that the idea came from MacArthur himself and that Shidehara was merely a pawn in his plans.\"\" Most recent research, however, has conclusively corroborated Shidehara's authorship. \nThe House of Representatives amended the Article and added \"Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order,\" to Paragraph 1 and \"In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph,\" to Paragraph 2. Hitoshi Ashida made this tenor. SCAP did not object to this amendment. Many scholars think the Government of Japan does not renounce the right (to have power) of self-defence because of this amendment. \nThe article was endorsed by the Imperial Diet of Japan on 3 November 1946. Kades later made statements, like MacArthur at a time when the U.S. was trying to get Japan to rearm, that suggested he had initially rejected the proposed language that prohibited Japan's use of force \"for its own security\", believing that self-preservation was the right of every nation. The historical record, however, casts doubt on this revisionist interpretation. \nInterpretation.\nSoon after the adoption of the Constitution of Japan on 3 May 1947, the Chinese Civil War ended in victory for the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 and the establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC). As a consequence, the United States was left without the Republic of China (ROC) on Mainland China as a military ally against communism in the Pacific. There was a desire on the part of the United States occupation forces for Japan to take a more active military role in the struggle against communism during the Cold War.\nIf Article 9 is looked upon as a motion to abolish war as an institution\u2014as envisaged in the 1961 McCloy\u2013Zorin Accords\u2014then the Korean crisis was the first opportunity for another country to second the Japanese motion and embark on the transition toward a true system of collective security under the United Nations. In fact, however, in 1950, following the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. 24th Infantry Division was pulled out of Japan and sent to fight on the front lines in Korea, and so Japan was left without any armed protection. MacArthur ordered the creation of a 75,000-strong to maintain order in Japan and repel any possible invasion from outside. The NPR was organized by United States Army Col. Frank Kowalski (later a U.S. congressman) using Army surplus equipment. To avoid possible constitutional violations, military items were given civilian names: tanks, for instance, were named \"special vehicles\". Shigesaburo Suzuki, a leader of the Japan Socialist Party, brought suit in the Supreme Court of Japan to have the NPR declared unconstitutional: however, his case was dismissed by the Grand Bench for lack of relevance.\nOn 1 August 1952, a new was formed to supervise the NPR and its maritime component. The new agency was directly headed by Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida. Yoshida supported its constitutionality: although he stated in a 1952 Diet committee session that \"to maintain war potential, even for the purpose of self-defense, [would] necessitate revision of the Constitution\". He later responded to the JSP's constitutionality claims by stating that the NSF had no true war potential in the modern era. In 1954, the National Safety Agency became the Japan Defense Agency (now Ministry of Defense), and the National Police Reserve became the .\nIn practice, the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) are very well equipped and the maritime forces are considered to be stronger than the navies of some of Japan's neighbors. The Supreme Court of Japan has reinforced the constitutionality of armed self-defense in several major rulings, most notably the Sunakawa Case of 1959, which upheld the legality of the then-current U.S.\u2013Japan Security Treaty.\n2014 reinterpretation.\nIn July 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (coalition government of the Liberal Democratic and Komeito Party) approved a reinterpretation of Article 9. This reinterpretation allows Japan to exercise the right of \"collective self-defense\" in some instances and to engage in military action if one of its allies were to be attacked. The Japanese National Diet made the reinterpretation official in September 2015 by enacting a series of laws allowing the Japan Self-Defense Forces to provide material support to allies engaged in combat internationally in an \"existential crisis situation\" for Japan. The stated justification was that failing to defend or support an ally would weaken alliances and endanger Japan.\nIt is considered by some parties as illegitimate since the Prime Minister circumvented the constitutional amendment procedure, dictating a radical change to the meaning of fundamental principles in the Constitution by way of Cabinet fiat without Diet debate, vote, or public approval. International reaction to this move was mixed. China expressed a negative view of this reinterpretation, while the US, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia reacted positively. The government of South Korea did not oppose the reinterpretation, but noted that it would not approve of JSDF operations in and around the Korean peninsula without its request or approval, and called upon Japan to act in a way that would win the trust of neighboring states. \nIn May 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Abe set a 2020 deadline for revising Article 9, which would legitimize the JSDF in the Constitution. Abe retired in 2020 due to health problems without revising Article 9.\nDebate.\nArticle 9 of the Constitution of Japan is best understood as having three distinct elements: (1) a provision that prohibits the use of force (paragraph one); (2) a provision that prohibits the maintenance of armed forces or \"other war potential\" (paragraph two, clause one); and (3) a denial of the rights of belligerency. It is helpful to keep these distinct elements in mind in considering the operation and effect of Article 9. Paragraph one, which prohibits the use of force has been highly effective in constraining Japanese foreign policy, with the result that Japan has not used force or been engaged in armed conflict since the promulgation of the Constitution. During the Gulf War of 1991, the government of Japan sought to join the U.S. coalition formed to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, but was informed by the Director of the Cabinet Legislation Bureau that doing so would constitute a use of force in violation of Article 9 paragraph one - so Japan was limited to providing financial assistance. \nThe second element of Article 9, which prohibits Japan from maintaining an army, navy or air force, has been highly controversial, and arguably less effective in shaping policy. From one perspective, one implication of the provision is that in strictly legal terms, the Japan Self-Defense Forces are not land, sea or air forces, but are extensions of the national police force. This has had broad implications for foreign, security and defense policy. According to the Japanese government, \"'war potential' in paragraph two means force exceeding a minimum level necessary for self-defense. Anything at or below that level does not constitute war potential.\" Apparently when the JSDF was created, \"since the capability of the JSDF was inadequate to sustain a modern war, it was not war potential\". Seemingly, the Japanese government has looked for loopholes in the wording of the peace clause and the \"constitutionality of the Japanese military has been challenged numerous times\". Some Japanese people believe that Japan should be truly pacifist and claim that the JSDF is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that it is within the nation's right to have the capacity to defend itself. Scholars have also discussed \"constitutional transformation ... [which] occurs when a constitutional provision has lost its effectiveness but has been replaced by a new meaning\". The use of private military companies is also ambiguous in nature and subjected to various interpretations. \nThe Liberal Democratic Party has advocated changing the context of Article 9 since 1955, when Article 9 was interpreted as renouncing the use of warfare in international disputes but not the internal use of force for the purpose of maintaining law and order. The LDP's longtime coalition partner Komeito have long opposed changing the context of Article 9. The LDP have never had the necessary supermajority (two-thirds of votes in both Houses) in the National Diet to change the Constitution, despite it having a supermajority with Komeito from 2005 to 2009 and from 2012 to 2021.\nThe main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, tends to concur with the LDP's interpretation. At the same time, both parties have advocated the revision of Article 9 by adding an extra clause explicitly authorizing the use of force for the purpose of self-defense against aggression directed against the Japanese nation. The Japan Socialist Party, on the other hand, had considered the JSDF as unconstitutional and advocated the full implementation of Article 9 through the demilitarization of Japan. When the party joined with the LDP to form a coalition government, it reversed its position and recognized the JSDF as a structure that was constitutional. The Japanese Communist Party considers the JSDF unconstitutional and has called for reorganization of Japanese defense policy to feature an armed militia.\nAt present, the government interprets Article 9 to mean that Japan cannot possess \"offensive military weapons\"; this has been interpreted to mean that Japan cannot have:\nThis has not inhibited the deployment of:\nall of which have substantial, and multi-mission, combat potential. \nOffensive cyberwarfare operations has been ambiguous in nature and subjected to various interpretations.\nSince the late 1990s, Article 9 has been the central feature of a dispute over the ability of Japan to undertake multilateral military commitments overseas. During the late 1980s, increases in government appropriations for the JSDF averaged more than 5% per year. By 1990 Japan was ranked third, behind the then-Soviet Union and the United States, in total defense expenditures, and the United States urged Japan to assume a larger share of the burden of defense of the western Pacific. (Japan has a guideline of a limit of 1% of GDP on defense spending; Japan defines a number of activities as non-defense spending.) Given these circumstances, some have viewed Article 9 as increasingly irrelevant. It has remained an important brake on the growth of Japan's military capabilities. Despite the fading of bitter wartime memories, the general public, according to opinion polls, continued to show strong support for this constitutional provision.\nThe different views can be clearly organized into four categories:\nEvidently, opinions range from one extreme of pacifism, to the other extreme of nationalism and complete remilitarization. The majority of Japanese citizens approve the spirit of Article 9 and consider it personally important. But since the 1990s, there has been a shift away from a stance that would tolerate no alteration of the article to allowing a revision that would resolve the discord between the JSDF and Article 9. Additionally, quite a few citizens consider that Japan should allow itself to commit the Japan Self-Defense Forces to \"collective defense\" efforts, like those agreed to on the UN Security Council in the Gulf War, for instance. Japan's ability to \"engage in collective defense\" has been argued. The involvement of Japan in the Gulf War of 1990, or lack of involvement, has provoked significant criticism. Despite U.S. pressure on Japan to assist America in Iraq, Japan limited their involvement in the war to financial contribution primarily because of domestic opposition to the deployment of troops. As a result of the painfully ardent disapproval from the U.S. during the Gulf War, Japan was quick to act after the September 11 attacks in 2001. It was clear that \"the 11 September attacks led to increased U.S. demands for Japanese security cooperation\". On October 29, 2001, the Anti-Terrorism Special Measures Law was passed, which \"further broadened the definition of Japan's self-defense\". The law allowed Japan to support the U.S. military on foreign territory. This law provoked \"citizen groups [to] file lawsuits against the Japanese government in order to stop the dispatch of JSDF troops to Iraq and to confirm the unconstitutionality of such a dispatch\", though the troops sent to Iraq were not sent for combat but for humanitarian aid. Japan has actively built U.S.\u2013Japan relations precisely because of Article 9 and Japan's inability to engage in an offensive war. It has been debated that, \"when [Koizumi] declared support for the U.S.-led war on Iraq in March 2003, and when he sent Japanese forces to aid the occupation in January 2004, it was not Iraq that was in the Japanese sights so much as North Korea\". Japan's unstable relations with North Korea, as well as other neighboring Asian countries has forced Japan to batter and bend Article 9 to \"permit an increasingly expansive interpretation\" of the constitution in the hopes of guaranteeing U.S. support in these relations.\nFormer Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi said in a speech, he called for abolishing Article 9, saying if Japan were to become a: \"respectable member (of) the community of nations it would first have to revise its constitution and rearm: If Japan is alone in renouncing war\u00a0... she will not be able to prevent others from invading her land. If, on the other hand, Japan could defend herself, there would be no further need of keeping United States garrison forces in Japan.\u00a0... Japan should be strong enough to defend herself.\" \nIn May 2007, the then Prime Minister of Japan Shinzo Abe (Nobusuke Kishi's grandson) marked the 60th anniversary of the Japanese Constitution by calling for a \"bold review\" of the document to allow the country to take a larger role in global security and foster a revival of national pride. Aside from Abe's Liberal Democratic Party, as of 2012, the Japan Restoration Party, Democratic Party of Japan, People's New Party, and Your Party support a constitutional amendment to reduce or abolish restrictions imposed by Article 9.\nOn 7 September 2018, candidate in the 2018 LDP Leadership Election, Shigeru Ishiba criticized Shinzo Abe for shifting his stance on Article 9 revision. Ishiba advocates the removal of Paragraph 2 of Article 9 which denies Japan's \"right of belligerency\". This is based on a LDP draft of changes for the law in 2012. In May 2017, Abe changed his stance to keep both the first and second paragraph of article 9 while adding a reference to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.\nIn January 2019, then-Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in the National Diet that long-range cruise missiles are not banned under Article 9 of the Constitution.\nOn 21 October 2019 a senior U.S. military officer in Tokyo said that \"Japan's avoidance of offensive weaponry under its constitution is no longer acceptable.\" The officer stated that Japan needs to rethink its rejection of offensive weapons and that the government should discuss it with the public. The officer said that the government of Japan should inform the public about the threats of China and North Korea.\nA constitutional amendment would require a two-thirds majority and pass referendum to effect it (as per Article 96 of the Japanese Constitution). Despite numerous attempts by the LDP to change Article 9, they have never been able to achieve the large majority required, as revision is opposed by a number of Japanese political parties, including the DPJ and the Japanese Communist Party.\nInternational comparisons.\nItaly.\nIn the Italian Constitution Article 11 is similar to the Japanese analogue, but the use of military forces is permitted for self-defense (articles 52 and 78) and also for \"peace-keeping\" purposes, if agreed with international organizations:\nItalian:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nEnglish translation:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes; it agrees to limitations of sovereignty where they are necessary to allow for a legal system of peace and justice between nations, provided the principle of reciprocity is guaranteed; it promotes and encourages international organizations furthering such ends.\nCosta Rica.\nThe Article 12 of the Constitution of Costa Rica enacted in 1949 establishes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Se proscribe el Ej\u00e9rcito como instituci\u00f3n permanente. Para la vigilancia y conservaci\u00f3n del orden p\u00fablico, habr\u00e1 las fuerzas de polic\u00eda necesarias.

There shall be the necessary police forces for surveillance and the preservation of the public order.\nMilitary forces may only be organized under a continental agreement or for the national defense; in either case, they shall always be subordinate to the civil power: they may not deliberate or make statements or representations individually or collectively.\nGermany.\nThe German Constitution emphasizes the obligations of International Law as being part of the federal law and taking precedence above subconstitutional law - although not above constitutional law (Art. 25 GG). \nIt also forbids international acts of aggression, including offensive wars, stating in Article 26, Section 1:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Handlungen, die geeignet sind und in der Absicht vorgenommen werden, das friedliche Zusammenleben der V\u00f6lker zu st\u00f6ren, insbesondere die F\u00fchrung eines Angriffskrieges vorzubereiten, sind verfassungswidrig.

{"id": "62713", "revid": "25424244", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62713", "title": "First Anglo-Dutch War", "text": "Conflict between the Commonwealth and the Dutch Republic\nThe First Anglo-Dutch War, or First Dutch War, was a naval conflict between the Commonwealth of England and the Dutch Republic. Largely caused by disputes over trade, it began with English attacks on Dutch merchant shipping, but expanded to vast fleet actions. Despite a series of victories in 1652 and 1653, the Commonwealth was unable to blockade Dutch trade, although English privateers inflicted serious losses on Dutch merchant shipping.\nThe economic damage eventually led to the Treaty of Westminster in 1654 where the Dutch were forced to make minor concessions to the Commonwealth. Both sides agreed to the exclusion of the House of Orange from the office of Stadtholder, but failed to resolve underlying commercial issues. In 1665, Dutch objections to the Navigation Acts and English concerns over their rival's trading practices led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War.\nBackground.\nIn the 16th century, England had supported the Dutch Republic in the Eighty Years' War against Spain. They cooperated in fighting the Spanish Armada and England supported the Dutch in the early part of the Eighty Years' War by sending money and troops and maintaining garrisons in key ports and a permanent English representative to the Dutch government to ensure coordination of the joint war effort, under the Treaty of Nonsuch. The separate peace in 1604 between England and Spain strained this relationship, although an Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1625, due to remain in force until 1640 was the basis of officially cordial relations between the two countries, and also formed the basis of Charles I of England's Dutch policy.\nThe weakening of Spanish power at the end of the Thirty Years' War in 1648 also meant that many colonial possessions of the Portuguese and some of the Spanish Empire and their mineral resources were effectively open to conquest by a stronger power. The ensuing rush for empire brought the former allies into conflict, and the Dutch, having made peace with Spain, quickly replaced the English as dominant traders with the Iberian Peninsula, adding to an English resentment about Dutch trade that had steadily grown since 1590. Although the Dutch wished to renew the 1625 treaty, their attempt to do so in 1639 was not responded to, so the treaty lapsed.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, the Dutch had built by far the largest mercantile fleet in Europe, with more ships than all the other states combined, and their economy, based substantially on maritime commerce, gave them a dominant position in European trade, especially in the North Sea and Baltic. Furthermore, they had conquered most of Portugal's territories and trading posts in the East Indies and Brazil, giving them control over the enormously profitable trade in spices. They were even gaining significant influence over England's trade with her as yet small North American colonies.\nThe economic disparity between England and the United Provinces increased in part because unlike the English, the Dutch system was based on free trade, making their products more competitive. For example, an English wool trader, who dealt largely with ports in English-speaking America, complained in 1651 that although his English ships would take wool cloth to America to be sold, they could expect to leave American ports with 4,000 to 5,000 bags of wool cloth unsold. Dutch ships, on the other hand, would leave American ports with barely 1,000 bags of wool cloth unsold. Because of this disparity, English trade with her traditional markets in the Baltic, Germany, Russia and Scandinavia withered. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the States General was officially neutral, a policy that antagonised both Parliamentarians and Royalists but which the powerful province of Holland considered most advantageous.\nThe Dutch also benefitted from the 1648 Peace of M\u00fcnster which confirmed their independence from Spain and ended the Eighty Years' War, although the Imperial Diet did not formally accept that the Dutch Republic was no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1728. The peace agreement's provisions included a monopoly over trade conducted through the Scheldt estuary, confirming the commercial ascendancy of Amsterdam; Antwerp, part of the Spanish Netherlands and before 1585 the most important port in Northern Europe, would not recover until the late 19th century. This translated into cheaper prices for Dutch products due to a steep and sustained drop in freight charges and insurance rates.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642, Parliamentarians and Royalists placed an embargo on Dutch ships trading with the opposing side. Since the vast majority of English ports were held by Parliament and the Royalist navy was weak, few Dutch ships were seized although the number steadily rose from 1644 to 1646, causing considerable tension. Despite these embargoes and their extension to Ireland and English colonies in Royalist hands, as late as 1649 the States General, and particularly the maritime provinces of Holland and Zeeland, wished to maintain their lucrative trade with England. Until 1648, Dutch naval vessels also inspected convoys of English ships which, as neutrals, were able to trade with the Spanish Netherlands. They sometimes brought ships into Dutch ports for more thorough examination and, very rarely, confiscated ships and cargoes as contraband.\nThe Execution of Charles I in January 1649 resulted in the formation of the Commonwealth of England, which continued to fight Royalists at home and in some of their colonies, leading to an expansion in the English Navy. At the same time, the war played havoc with English trading and shipping. To broadly study their commercial condition, the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament was erected on 1 August 1650. In October 1650, as part of the act to subdue their Royalist colonies and prevent Royalists from fleeing England, Parliament prohibited foreign ships from visiting or trading with any English plantations in America, without license; the act also allowed the seizure of ships violating the prohibition by both the English navy and merchant ships. The act was a temporary war measure hastily enacted and, while it was enacted in general terms to include all countries, it was aimed primarily at the Dutch, and was superseded the following year by a carefully prepared Navigation Act. Writing a century later, Adam Anderson relates of the period that \"It had been observed with concern, that the merchants of England for several years past had usually freighted the Hollanders shipping for bringing home their own merchandize, because their freight was at a lower rate than that of English ships. The Dutch shipping were thereby made use of even for importing our own American products; whilst our shipping lay rotting in our harbours; our mariners also for want of employment at home, went into the service of the Hollanders.\" The English accused the Dutch of profiting from the turmoil of the English Civil War.\nOpposing fleets.\nThe Dutch fleet in the Eighty Years' War had three tasks: as a Battle Force against major Spanish fleets, to convoy Dutch merchant ships and protect its fishing fleet and to actively oppose privateers, particularly those of Dunkirk. In that war, the two latter tasks were more important than major fleet actions, and they required more numerous but smaller warships than the Battle Force, although these smaller ships could also be used in m\u00eal\u00e9e battles, where boarding rather than gunfire might decide the result. Following their victory over the Spanish fleet at the Battle of the Downs on October 21, 1639, and after peace was made with Spain in 1648, the need for major warships lessened, although smaller ones were still required for convoy service, particularly to the Mediterranean, the East Indies and later to the Caribbean. The financially exhausted Dutch Admiralties allowed their squadrons, and particularly their major warships, to deteriorate.\nIn the period up to the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Republic had four sources of warships. The first was the ships of five autonomous Admiralties (\"colleges\"), three in the province of Holland, which were supported by local taxes on commerce and contributions from the inland provinces. Each Admiralty was responsible for the design, construction, armament and manning of its own ships and the appointment of flag officers for its squadron. The second was the so-called \"director's ships\" (\"directieschepen\"), convoy escorts provided by the burgomasters and merchants of six cities including Amsterdam and Hoorn to protect their Baltic trades. The cities were responsible for providing what were in effect modified and armed merchant ships, appointing their captains and providing crews. The next group were hybrid ships of the Dutch East India Company, which could act as warships or cargo carriers and the last were hired merchant vessels, whose owners had little interest in risking their property. Although captains of the East India Company were generally competent, they were unused to naval discipline, as were the more variable in quality commanders of director's ships and hired merchant ships.\nAfter 1648 the Admiralties sold off many of their larger ships, including Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp's own flagship, the \"Aemilia\", of 600 tons and fitted with 57 guns. Admiral Tromp was forced to shift his flag to the 600-ton \"Brederode\", of 54 guns. By 1652, the Dutch Admiralties had only 79 ships at their disposal. Many of these ships were in bad repair, with fewer than 50 being seaworthy. All these ships were inferior in firepower to the largest English first and second rate ships. The numerical deficiency in the Dutch navy was to be made up by arming merchantmen.\nThe strongest restraint on the number of sailing warships was the large crews required, so fleets were limited by the number of seaman that could be induced or compelled to serve. England had a greater population and employed impressment to make up crew numbers, so could generally maintain more fully crewed ships than the Dutch could. The Dutch partly compensated by hiring foreign sailors from Scandinavia and the Baltic. The English navy of the Commonwealth period was in better condition and was still improving. The Commonwealth had won the English Civil War in 1652 with a strong and effective navy that had supported and supplied Cromwell's army in the wars in Scotland and Ireland; blockaded the Royalist fleet of Prince Rupert in Lisbon; and organised a system of convoys to protect the commerce of the Commonwealth against the numerous privateers based in European ports.\nCompared to the Dutch fleet, the English fleet had larger ships of the first and second rates, but proportionately fewer frigates, as the English fleet was principally designed to fight in major actions, whilst providing convoy escorts or fighting privateers was a secondary task. The first and second rate ships included the ageing \"Resolution\" and which dated from James\u00a0I's reign, along with the \"Sovereign\" and others from Charles\u00a0I's navy. However, the \"Naseby\", \"Richard\", \"Dunbar\", and several others were built during the Commonwealth. These were part of a naval expansion financed by an Act of Parliament on 10 November 1650 which imposed a 15% tax on merchant shipping. Between 1649 and 1651 the English fleet included 18 ships that were each superior in firepower to Dutch Admiral Tromp's new flagship \"Brederode\", the largest Dutch ship. All the English ships intended to fight in the battle line were more heavily armed than their equivalents in other European navies, sacrificing freeboard and the ability to use their lower guns in adverse weather in exchange for more powerful ordnance. English ships could fire and hit the enemy at a greater range, and favoured the use of round shot over the chain shot which was popular in other navies.\nPolitical tensions.\nThe commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands were intensified when the English Parliament passed the Navigation Act 1651. This limited Dutch trade with any of the English colonies in America unless the shipping was done in \"English bottoms\" i.e. English ships. Indeed, any cargo to English ports or the ports of English colonies from anywhere in the world was required to be carried in English ships. Furthermore, the Navigation Act forbade all trade with those English colonies that retained connections and sympathy for the royalist cause of Charles I. To have accepted the terms of the Navigation Act was seen by the Dutch as agreeing to subordinate Dutch trade to the English trading system. This insulted Dutch pride and damaged their economy, but the more immediate cause of the war was the actions of the English navy and privateers against Dutch shipping. In 1651, 140 Dutch merchantmen were seized on the open seas. During January 1652 alone, another 30 Dutch ships were captured at sea and taken to English ports. Protests to England by the States General of the United Provinces were of no avail: the English Parliament showed no inclination toward curbing these seizures of Dutch shipping.\nDuring the English Civil War, the Dutch Stadtholder Frederick Henry had given significant financial support to Charles I of England, to whom he had close family ties. The States General had been generally neutral and refused to become involved with representatives of either king or parliament; it also attempted to mediate between the two sides, an attitude that offended both English Royalists and its parliament. Frederick Henry's influence was lessening with the growth of strongly republican sentiment among the ruling class, and he could not involve the Netherlands in direct support for Charles I, particularly as his country was still at war with Spain.\nAfter the death of Frederick Henry in March 1647, his son, stadtholder William II of Orange, attempted to extend the power of the stadtholderate particularly through maintaining the size of the army, which he commanded and using his supporters in six provinces to outvote Holland, the most prosperous province, in the States General. Following the end of the Eighty Years' War and the execution of his father-in-law, Charles I, William attempted to support the English Royalist cause to an extent that gave concern to even his own followers, and which involved him in disputes with the more committed republicans, particularly those in Holland. The execution of Charles outraged the Orangists, and the Dutch republicans that had attempted to save Charles' life, but the execution did not prevent the States General from continuing a policy of broad neutrality, dealing unofficially with the English parliament while allowing Royalist envoys into the country. The Commonwealth and the Dutch Republic had many things in common: they were both republican and Protestant and many members of States General sympathised with the aims of the English parliamentarians and, while strongly against its regicide, supported a pragmatic policy of neutrality, in opposition to the Royalist-supporting stadtholder. The impasse between the two sides ended with the sudden death of William II in November 1650. His attempts to involve the Netherlands in action against the English Commonwealth in support of the exiled Charles II could have led at least to limited hostilities and possibly outright war and lead to a republican reaction. Shortly before his death, William attempted to gain control of Amsterdam by a coup, and then imprisoned six leading members of the States of Holland, but they were released when he died. These six led the province of Holland to assume the leadership of the republican movement, the Loevestein faction, which saw the Netherlands as a free republic without a stadholder. The resulting First Stadtholderless period began when William II died in 1650, although it was not until January 1651 that the last of the seven provinces agreed to it.\nEnglish delegation to The Hague.\nAs early as 1643, Oliver St John had urged fellow Protestants in the Netherlands to sign the Solemn League and Covenant that the Scots had already signed, but had been rebuffed. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, parliament sent an envoy to the Hague to discuss an alliance with the United Provinces, but he was murdered shortly after his arrival in reprisal for the king's death, after which the proposal was left in abeyance until more favourable times. The sudden death on 6 November 1650 of William II, the Stadholder of the United Provinces, whose popularity had declined since his election in 1647 in the face of growing discontent from the States Party in the United Provinces, changed matters. The States party was the political faction identified most closely with the idea of rule solely by the States General, and was especially powerful in the large commercially oriented province of Holland. To obtain support against William II, it had sought the assistance of Oliver Cromwell. After William II's death, the States Party was in a much stronger position politically, and no longer valued or needed Cromwell's support against the stadholderate.\nIn January 1651, the English Council of State, aware that the Netherlands States General was about to recognise the Commonwealth as the legitimate English government, which it did on 28 January, prepared an embassy to the republic headed by Oliver St John, with two envoys extraordinary. When it arrived in The Hague on 7 March 1651, the English delegation made it clear that their aim was to \"enter into a more strict and intimate alliance and union' with the republic\" to be effected by \"a Confederation of the two Commonwealths\". and based on proposal put in 1648 by a parliamentary envoy that the Dutch had declined to consider. Any Dutch expectation that recognising the Commonwealth would end dissent between the two countries was disabused and, based on the earlier proposal, the States General drew up a draft of 36 articles, the first eleven of which were the subject of intensive discussion. By June the Dutch believed that agreement had been reached on those points, and the English delegation announced their imminent departure, leaving on 2 July.\nDuring their three-month stay, other events had convinced the English delegation of Dutch animosity. The Hague was the residence of the young widow of William II, Charles I's daughter Mary Henrietta Stuart, the Princess Royal. Her presence attracted exiled English noblemen not fighting with her brother Charles to The Hague, which had for many years been an Orangist stronghold. The delegation appointed by the Commonwealth, could only leave their lodgings under armed escort, for fear of being assaulted by Royalists or large Orangist mobs in their pay. When the English delegates left in the last week of June, they reported that the Dutch were untrustworthy and that the United Provinces were under the control of the Orangist party and thus a threat to the security of the Commonwealth. Although the States of Holland and West Friesland were unwilling, if not unable, to suppress the activities of English Royalists, Orangists that deplored the execution of Charles I, and certain strict Calvinist ministers opposing Cromwell's religious innovations, it would have been more logical for him to ally with the ruling republican regents to overcome the pro-Stuart Orangists than go to war, were economic issues not more pressing.\nFollowing the departure of St John, the States General sent a delegation to London to continue discussions. However, after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, the radical element in the English parliament became stronger and the group including Cromwell that genuinely favoured an alliance with the Netherlands was outnumbered by those wanting either to cripple Dutch trade without going to war or to provoke a war with the Dutch republic for political reasons. The Dutch considered that the economic provisions of the 36 articles they had drafted could form the basis of a trade agreement without compromising the independence of the United Provinces or their becoming involved in a war with Spain, but it soon became apparent that the English negotiators were most concerned to ensure Dutch action against English Royalists and restrictions on the Dutch carrying trade between third countries. The armed confrontation between Tromp and Blake off Dover took place before these issues were settled, and the English immediately halted negotiations and refused to reopen them when the Dutch offered concessions, preferring war.\nPath to war.\nIn England, after 1648 and more particularly after Charles' execution and the proclamation of the Commonwealth, the army assumed a more prominent political role compared with parliament.\nThe neutralisation of Rupert's fleet and its bases, the defeat of the Irish Royalists at Rathmines and Drogheda in 1649 and of the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar in 1650 made the Commonwealth more assertive in its relations with the Dutch, both on trade and on William II's support for the Stuart cause. French support for the English Royalists had led the Commonwealth to commence the issuing of letters of marque against French ships and against French goods in neutral ships in December 1649. Dozens of neutral Dutch ships were detained near French ports by English ships operating under letters of marque, and some of these were seized. Dutch concerns were further raised by an English embargo on Dutch trade with Scotland declared soon after.\nIn 1649 and 1650, General-at-Sea Robert Blake drove the Royalist fleet under Prince Rupert from its bases in Ireland and pursued it to the port of Lisbon, where it was protected by the harbour's forts and the Portuguese king's refusal to let Blake enter the port. The Council of State decided to reinforce Blake and authorised him to seize ships from Brazil in reprisal, and to withdraw the English envoy to Portugal, whose departure in July 1650 created a state of war. In response to the Portuguese failure to expel Rupert, Blake continued to seize merchant ships entering the River Tagus from Brazil. On 24 September 1650 Blake attacked a fleet of 23 merchant vessels from Brazil and their naval escort, sinking the Portuguese Admiral and capturing the Vice-Admiral and ten of the larger merchant ships. The Portuguese court were compelled to insist that Rupert leave Lisbon harbour in September 1650, but after finding Blake waiting for him, Rupert placed his ships under the protection of Portuguese coastal forts, where he remained until December, when he escaped to the West Indies. The threat of the Royalist fleet had been neutralised by forcing it into retreat. Its strongholds in the Isles of Scilly, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were captured in 1651. This was followed in 1652 by the recovery of England's colonial possessions in the West Indies and North America by General George Ayscue.\nInfuriated by the treatment of the English delegation in the Hague and emboldened by their victory against Charles II and his forces at the Battle of Worcester on September 3, 1651, the English Parliament, as noted above, passed the first of the Navigation Acts in October 1651. It ordered that only English ships and ships from the originating country could import goods to England. This measure, as also noted above, was particularly aimed at hampering the shipping of the highly trade-dependent Dutch and often used as a pretext simply to take their ships; as General Monck put it: \"The Dutch have too much trade, and the English are resolved to take it from them.\" Agitation among the Dutch merchants was further increased by George Ayscue's capture in early 1652 of 27 Dutch ships trading with the Royalist colony of Barbados in contravention of the trade prohibition imposed by the Commonwealth. Over a hundred other Dutch ships were captured by English privateers between October 1651 and July 1652. Moreover, the death of Dutch Stadtholder William II, who had favoured an expansion of the army at the expense of the navy, had led to a change in Dutch defence policy towards protecting the great trading concerns of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Accordingly, the States General decided on 3 March 1652 to expand the fleet by hiring and equipping 150 merchant ships as ships of war to allow effective convoying against hostile English actions. Although the States of Holland stressed that this measure was intended defensive and it carefully selected its captains and issued prudent instructions about saluting English warships, when news of this decision reached London on 12 March 1652, it was seen as a provocative move.\nWar.\nThe Commonwealth began to prepare for war, but as both nations were unready, war might have been delayed if not for an unfortunate encounter between the fleets of Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp and General at Sea Robert Blake in the English Channel near Dover on 29 May 1652. An ordinance of Cromwell required all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute, reviving an ancient right the English had long insisted on. Tromp himself was fully aware of the need to give this mark of courtesy, but partly through a misunderstanding and partly out of resentment among the seamen, it was not given promptly, and Blake opened fire, starting the brief Battle of Dover. Tromp lost two ships but escorted his convoy to safety.\nThe States of Holland sent their highest official, the Grand Pensionary Adriaan Pauw, to London in a last desperate attempt to prevent war, but in vain: English demands had become so extreme that no self-respecting state could meet them. War was declared by the English Parliament on 10 July 1652. The Dutch diplomats realised what was at stake: one of the departing ambassadors said, \"The English are about to attack a mountain of gold; we are about to attack a mountain of iron.\" The Dutch Orangists were jubilant however; they expected that either victory or defeat would bring them to power.\nThe first months of the war saw English attacks against the Dutch convoys. Blake was sent with 60 ships to disrupt Dutch fishing in the North Sea and Dutch trade with the Baltic, leaving Ayscue with a small force to guard the Channel. On 12 July 1652, Ayscue intercepted a Dutch convoy returning from Portugal, capturing seven merchantmen and destroying three. Tromp gathered a fleet of 96 ships to attack Ayscue, but southerly winds kept him in the North Sea. Turning north to pursue Blake, Tromp caught up with the English fleet off the Shetland Islands, but a storm scattered his ships and there was no battle. On 26 August 1652, an outward-bound Dutch convoy with an escort of director's ships from Zeeland commanded by Michiel de Ruyter, who held the rank of \"commandeur\", broadly equivalent to commodore was sighted by Ayscue, with a more numerous squadron of warships and armed merchant ships. Ayscue attempted to attack the convoy with around nine of his strongest and fastest warships, but De Ruyter counter-attacked and, in the Battle of Plymouth, surrounded the English warships which were not supported by their armed merchant ships. The convoy escaped, Ayscue was relieved of his command and de Ruyter gained prestige in his first independent command.\nTromp had also been suspended after the failure in Shetland, and Vice-Admiral Witte de With was given command. The Dutch convoys being at the time safe from English attack, De With saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces and gain control of the seas. At the Battle of the Kentish Knock on 8 October 1652 the Dutch attacked the English fleet near the mouth of the River Thames, but were beaten back with many casualties. The English Parliament, believing the Dutch to be near defeat, sent away twenty ships to strengthen the position in the Mediterranean. This division of forces left Blake with only 42 men of war by November, while the Dutch were making every effort to reinforce their fleet. This division led to an English defeat by Tromp in the Battle of Dungeness in December, while it failed to save the English Mediterranean fleet, largely destroyed at the Battle of Leghorn in March 1653.\nThe Dutch had effective control of the Channel, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean, with English ships blockaded in port. As a result, Cromwell convinced Parliament to begin secret peace negotiations with the Dutch. In February 1653, Adriaan Pauw responded favourably, sending a letter from the States of Holland indicating their sincere desire to reach a peace agreement. However, these discussions, which were only supported by a bare majority of members of the Rump parliament, dragged on without much progress for almost a year.\nThough the politicians were close to ending the conflict, the naval war continued and, over the winter of 1652\u201353, the English fleet repaired its ships and considered its tactics. All of the sea battles fought in 1652 were chaotic, with boarding and capturing enemy ships a favoured tactic, particularly of the Dutch. Squadrons or even individual ships fought without regard to the rest of the fleet, although the English fleet instructions of 1650 emphasised the importance of supporting other ships of the same squadron, particularly the flagship. In the first major battle of 1653, the English fleet challenged the Dutch in the three-day Battle of Portland, which began in 28 February. They captured at least 20 Dutch merchant ships, captured or destroyed at least eight and possibly twelve warships and drove the Dutch from the Channel. Like the battles of 1652, this was chaotic, but the most notable tactical events happened in the first day, when Tromp led the whole Dutch fleet against about two dozen English ships at the rear of the fleet, hoping to overpower them before the bulk of the English fleet could come to their aid. However, the outnumbered English ships extemporised a line ahead formation and managed to keep the Dutch at bay through coordinated heavy gunfire.\nWhether as a direct result of the Battle of Portland or the accumulation of experience gained over some years, in March 1653, Robert Blake wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions, a major overhaul of English naval tactics, containing the first formal description of the line of battle. The success of this new formation was evident in the Battle of the Gabbard in June 1653, when the English fleet not only defeated the Dutch in a long-range artillery duel but suffered so little damage that it could maintain a blockade rather than sending many ships to port for repairs. The Dutch, in contrast, relied less on linear tactics, preferring to close with English ships to board and capture then as late as the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, and they also retained numbers of slow and badly armed hired merchant ships in their fleet as late as that battle, when the English fleet was already questioning their use.\nIn mid-March 1653, the States of Holland sent a detailed peace proposal to the English \"Rump Parliament\", where it generated a fierce debate and a slim majority for a response to be made. The response made first to the States of Holland and then to the States General in April was critical of the Dutch proposals, but at least allowed discussions to start. Little was achieved until both the Rump Parliament and its short-lived successor the Nominated Parliament had been dissolved, the latter in December 1653. The following month the States General asked for negotiations to be restarted and in May Cromwell agreed to receive Dutch envoys in London. In mid June, Johan de Witt persuaded the States General to send commissioners to London to negotiate peace terms and Cromwell was receptive, although he was insistent that the Dutch republic must ensure the House of Orange would not become dominant again, and declined to repeal the Navigation Act.\nCromwell again put forward his plan for a political union between the two nations to the four Dutch envoys who had arrived in London in late June, but they emphatically rejected this. He also wished to avoid further conflict with the Dutch Republic, as it was planning war with Spain. Cromwell then proposed a military alliance against Spain, promising to repeal the Navigation Act in return for Dutch assistance in the conquest of Spanish America: this too was rejected. Cromwell then fell back on a proposal of 27 articles, two of which were unacceptable to the Dutch: that all Royalists had to be expelled, and that Denmark, the ally of the Republic, should be abandoned in its war against Sweden. In the end Cromwell accepted that the 25 agreed articles would form the basis for peace.\nMeanwhile, the English navy tried to gain control over the North Sea, and in the two-day Battle of the Gabbard in June drove the Dutch back to their home ports with the loss of 17 warships captured or destroyed, starting a blockade of the Dutch coast, which led to a crippling of the Dutch economy. The Dutch were unable to feed their dense urban population without a regular supply of Baltic wheat and rye; prices of these commodities soared and the poor were soon unable to buy food, and starvation ensued.\nThe final battle of the war was the hard-fought and bloody Battle of Scheveningen in August, fought because the Dutch were desperate to break the English blockade. This was a tactical victory for the English fleet, which captured or destroyed at least a dozen and possibly 27 Dutch warships for the loss of two or three English ones, and captured or killed some 2,000 men including Tromp, who was killed early in the battle, for a loss of 500 English dead. However, despite their heavy losses of men and ships, the Dutch fleet was able to retreat to the Texel, and the English had to abandon their blockade, so the Dutch achieved their aim. The death of Tromp was a blow to Dutch morale, which increased the Dutch desire to end the war: similar feelings arose in England. Although many had been enriched by the war, trade as a whole had suffered. However, in September, the Dutch fleet, under Witte de With, was able to resume its operations. It successfully disembarked 400 merchant ships and returned with an equivalent number, all carrying valuable goods from the East Indies, which demonstrated the reopening of the sea routes.\nAllied with Denmark and maintaining a formidable presence at the Danish Sound, the Dutch effectively put an end to English trade in the Baltic region. Throughout 1653, not a single English vessel passed through the Sound. In the Mediterranean, the Dutch had achieved similar success. Additionally, in the East Indies, the Dutch East India Company had swiftly established maritime dominance, spanning from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. The English agent at Livorno, Charles Longland, reported to London, that the Dutch had been heavily defeated in home waters but added \"yet our losses here have been so visible to all Europe, Asia and Africa that they will not believe but that our condition is as bad at home.\" After Scheveningen, the Dutch also turned to using smaller warships and commerce raiding with the result that, by November Cromwell, despite military success in the North Sea, was anxious to make peace as the Dutch were capturing numerous English merchant ships.\nDespite this the Dutch Republic was also unable to sustain a prolonged naval war as English privateers inflicted serious damage on Dutch shipping. At the time the Dutch merchant fleet was three times larger than the English, and it is estimated that the Dutch lost between 1,000 and 1,700 vessels (the most reliable estimate is from Amsterdam Burgomasters who claimed the Dutch lost 1,200) of all sizes to privateers in this war. This accounted for 8% of the total Dutch mercantile fleet, amounted to double the value of England's entire ocean-going merchant fleet. These losses were three to four times as many as the English lost (440 ships in total), and more than the total Dutch losses for the other two Anglo-Dutch wars in the 17th century. This was the greatest single maritime disaster suffered by the Dutch world Entrep\u00f4t during its great age. In addition, as press-ganging was forbidden, enormous sums had to be paid to attract enough sailors to man the fleet. The Dutch were unable to defend all of their colonies and it had too few colonists or troops in Dutch Brazil to prevent the more numerous Portuguese, dissatisfied by Dutch rule, from reconquest. In Holland itself the war took its toll \u2013 shipping businesses had ceased trading and work was hard to find. In Amsterdam fifteen hundred houses were untenanted, many observed a large number of roaming beggars and grass was growing in the streets. The condition of the country had left the Dutch no choice but to accept Cromwells terms.\nPeace negotiations continued until March 1654 when Cromwell demanded a change in that the then-four-year-old Prince of Orange should be excluded from future government appointments, like the stadtholderate, or the captaincy-general of the States Army. This was at first rejected, but the Dutch eventually accepted, and Peace was declared on 15 April 1654 with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster and ratified by all parties by 22 April.\nAftermath.\nThe Dutch were saved from harsh peace. In part to the leniency of Cromwell, but also because he feared a longer war, along with the massive economic damage to the English maritime economy. The Dutch nevertheless realized few of the objectives in their 36 articles, and had to make a few minor concessions - the acceptance of the Act of Navigation which excluded their merchants from all commerce between England and its colonies, an indemnity of \u00a385,000 for losses of the EIC in the East Indies and \u00a33,615 which had to be paid to the heirs of the victims of the Amboyna massacre. The island of Run in the East Indies was to be ceded to the East India Company, although the Dutch never actually returned the island. Lastly, a symbolic gesture; saluting the flag of English warships in the Channel.\nCromwell's original political aim of a union that would subordinate the Dutch was dropped; instead the main concession which he desired bore no role in the original reason for going to war. This was the sole condition that the Dutch had to agree that no Prince of Orange or other member of the House of Orange should hold the office of Stadtholder or any other public office in the Netherlands, a demand that was strongly opposed by Orangists, but in the interests of the Dutch States Party, led by Johan de Witt. Although this was not part of the formal peace treaty, the two members of the negotiating team from the province of Holland agreed to a secret annexe providing that England would only ratify the treaty after the States of Holland had passed an Act of Seclusion, excluding the House of Orange from holding public office in that province: this legislation was passed in May 1654. There was an adverse reaction from several of the other Dutch provinces, but their provincial assemblies could neither overcome their own internal divisions nor coordinate opposition with other provinces. However, although they did not enact their own Exclusion legislation then, in practice they did not oppose it. Only after the Second Anglo-Dutch War did four other provinces besides Holland adopt the Perpetual Edict (1667) sanctioning Exclusion.\nEngland celebrated the peace but it was also a relief - Cromwell proclaimed 23 May 1654 to be a day of Thanksgiving. The English made some small gains out of the peace treaty, while not making any concessions to the Dutch, but the strong commercial position of the Dutch Republic remained largely intact and the rivalry between the two nations was not resolved. Especially in their emerging overseas colonies, hostilities continued between Dutch and English trading companies, which had warships and troops of their own.\nThe English soon took advantage of their new ships seized from the Dutch to implement a merchant fleet on similar lines to the Dutch, particularly the effort to build more flyboats. The Dutch too had started on a major shipbuilding programme to remedy the lack of ships of the line evident at the battles of the Kentish Knock, the Gabbard, and Scheveningen. The admiralties were now forbidden by law to sell off these sixty new ships. When in 1665 the Second Anglo-Dutch War started the Dutch were thus much better prepared.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In adult life, he became a renowned ship captain and naval commander, successfully leading Dutch forces fighting for independence in the Eighty Years' War, and then against England in the First Anglo-Dutch War, proving an innovative tactician and enabling the newly independent Dutch nation to become a major sea power.\nHe was killed in battle by a sharpshooter from an English ship. Several ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy have carried the name HNLMS \"Tromp\" after him and/or his son Cornelis, also a Dutch admiral of some renown.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Brielle in the Netherlands, Tromp was the oldest son of Harpert Maertensz, a naval officer and captain of the frigate \"Olifantstromp (\"Elephant Trunk\")\". The surname \"Tromp\" probably derives from the name of the ship; it first appeared in documents in 1607. He was baptized 3 May 1598 in St. Catherine's Cathedral. In 1606, the Tromp family moved to Rotterdam where Tromp's father was appointed by the Admiralty of Rotterdam as captain of the frigate \"Olifantstromp\". His mother supplemented the family's income as a washerwoman. In 1607, at the age of nine, Tromp went to sea with his father aboard the \"Olifantsdorp\", of the Rotterdam squadron, commanded by Commodore Mooy Lambert, as part of the Dutch fleet of Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Heemskerck, with the objective of blockading Dunkirk and the Spanish coast and intercepting the Spanish fleet being sent to drive the Dutch from the East Indies. On 25 April, a fierce battle ensued at the Battle of Gibraltar, resulting in a great Dutch victory.\nIn 1610, after his father's discharge because of a navy reorganization, the Tromps were on their way to Guinea on their merchantman when they were attacked by a squadron of seven ships under command of the English pirate Peter Easton. During the fight, Tromp's father was slain by a cannonball, where after the battle his body was thrown overboard by the boarding party. According to legend, the 12-year-old boy rallied the crew of the ship with the cry \"Won't you avenge my father's death?\" The pirates seized him and sold him on the slave market of Sal\u00e9 where he ended up serving as a cabin boy. Two years later, Easton was moved by pity and ordered his redemption.\nSet free, Tromp supported his mother and three sisters by working in a Rotterdam shipyard. He went to sea again at 19, briefly working for the navy, but he was captured again in 1621 after having rejoined the merchant fleet, this time by Barbary corsairs off Tunis. He was kept as a slave until the age of 24 and by then had so impressed the Bey of Tunis and the corsair John Ward with his skills in gunnery and navigation that the latter offered him a position in his fleet. When Tromp refused, the Bey was even more impressed by this show of character and allowed him to leave as a free man in 1622.\nNaval career.\nMaarten Tromp was supreme commander of the Dutch fleet during the later part of the Eighty Years' War and throughout the First Anglo-Dutch War. He is widely considered the best Dutch naval commander during most of this time. Tromp's former superior, Admiral Piet Pieterszoon Hein, once told a friend that Tromp as a seaman and a commander possessed a sound character that distinguished him from all the captains he had ever known. Tromp joined the Dutch navy as a lieutenant in July 1622, entering service with the Admiralty of the Maze based in Rotterdam, serving aboard the \"Bruynvisch\". On 7 May 1624, he married Dignom Cornelisdochter de Haes, the daughter of a merchant; in the same year he became captain of the \"St. Antonius\", a fast sailing dispatch and escort yacht. His first distinction was as Lieutenant-Admiral Hein's flag captain on the \"Vliegende Groene Draeck\" during the fight with Ostend privateers in 1629 in which Hein was killed, after which Tromp returned home with his body.\nEighty Years' War.\nDuring the Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648), Tromp was appointed as full captain in 1629 at the initiative of stadtholder Frederick Henry himself, where Tromp demonstrated that he was very successful in fighting the Dunkirkers as a squadron commander, functioning as a commandeur on the \"Vliegende Groene Draeck\". Despite receiving four honorary golden chains, he was not promoted further. The \"Vliegende Groene Draeck\" foundered and new heavy vessels were reserved for the flag officers while Tromp was relegated to the old \"Prins Hendrik\". After Tromp's first wife died in 1634, with whom he had three sons left for Tromp to support, he subsequently left the naval service that year in disappointment. He became a deacon and married Alijth Jacobsdochter Arckenboudt, the daughter of Brill's wealthy schepen and tax collector, on 12 September 1634.\nIn 1637 Tromp re-enlisted in the Dutch navy and was promoted from captain to Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West Frisia, under the Stadtholder, Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. This occurred following the resignation of Lieutenant-Admiral Philips van Dorp, and the dismissal of Vice-Admiral Jasper Liefhebber, and other flag officers due to incompetence, neglecting the Dutch navy which had fallen into a deplorable state, with several captains resigning their commissions and seeking service with the army. With the resignation of van Dorp on 27 October the States of Holland once again asked Tromp to accept the command of the Dutch navy. Tromp accepted but under the conditions that afforded him greater authority than was allowed for the navy\u2019s previous commanders, remembering how badly the fleet had been neglected by them under van Dorp. Tromp insisted on a greater number of ships, which were to be well outfitted with supplies, and well manned. The States gave Tromp their solemn promise that they would grant all his requests. The terms of Tromp\u2019s official appointment from the Stadtholder further strengthened his position. Witte de With, a year younger, very brave but brutal and ill-tempered, was appointed as his vice-admiral. Both were born in Den Briel and served as flag captains under Piet Hein. Although formally ranking under the Admiral-General Frederick Henry of Orange, he was the \"de facto\" supreme commander of the Dutch fleet, as the stadtholders never fought at sea. Tromp was mostly occupied with blockading the privateer port of Dunkirk.\nWith his flagship, the \"Aemilia\", Tromp promptly re-established the neglected blockade of Dunkirk and took steps to hinder the transportation of Spanish troops to Flanders. Tromp out-maneuvered Oquendo's fleet which was bound for Flanders but was forced to retreat to England at the Downs, behind the sandbanks of the Kentish coast, where they remained trapped, while a prolonged debate preceding the Wars of the Three Kingdoms continued in London. Tromp was already familiar with the channel from his cruising during 1637 and 1638, and sailed to Calais Roads, blocking the southwestern entrance of Dunkirk, where he resupplied his fleet from Calais with the support of Cardinal Richelieu. Now with a reinforced fleet Tromp, in spite of the objection of Charles I, who was on good terms with the Spain. attacked on 21 October, during the Battle of the Downs, destroying a large proportion of Oquendo's armada. During the Fight in the Channel, a preliminary action to the Downs, Tromp was the first fleet commander known for the deliberate use of line of battle tactics, marking the end of Spanish naval power. For his landmark victory Tromp was rewarded by the States-General and knighted by Louis XIII of France, a close Dutch ally in the war against Spain. Shortly thereafter his second wife died. Tromp married again in 1640, to Cornelia van Berckhout.\nIn 1643 the deputy of parliament in Holland made a loud protest in the General Assembly against the Prince of Orange for his orders to Tromp to allow two of the frigates bought by English royalists in Dunkirk, to be released for their use and command.\nDuring his career, his main rival was Vice-Admiral Witte de With, who also served the Admiralty of Rotterdam (de Maze) from 1637. De With temporarily replaced him as supreme commander for the Battle of Kentish Knock. Tromp's crew would not permit De With, who had a reputation of severity when disciplining a crew, to raise his flag on their ship, and insisted that he use the \"Prins Willem\" as his flagship. Tromp's successor was Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam.\nTromp commanded the Dutch squadron that escorted Queen Henrietta Maria in 1643 when she returned from The Hague to King Charles I. Opposed to her returning to England the Parliamentarian squadron under William Batten threatened to attack the Queen's convoy when it landed at Bridlington but was thwarted by Tromp to withdraw.\nFirst Anglo-Dutch War.\nIn the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652 to 1653, Tromp commanded the Dutch fleet in the battles of Dover, Dungeness, Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen.\nPrior to the war, Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament had issued an ordinance prohibiting foreign trade and requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to lower their flag in salute and as a sign of compliance. A Dutch embassy was in London trying to negotiate a lifting of the Navigation Acts, but without much success.\nOn 19 May 1652, Tromp was cruising in the English Channel with a fleet of forty ships between Nieuport and the mouth of the Meuse River, with general orders to protect Holland's commerce, while keeping watch over the English navy, which was searching and seizing Dutch merchant ships prior. English Admiral Robert Blake had recently seized seven richly laden Dutch merchant ships, off the coast of Fairlight. Blake was now lying in Dover Roads with fifteen ships, while eight others were anchored in Bourne in the Downs. When Tromp failed to lower his flag in salute, Blake, aboard his flagship \"James\", believing Tromp had just received orders from a dispatch ketch to commence battle, fired two warning shots with no cannonballs. The Battle of Dover was begun when Tromp refused to strike his flag and instead hoisted a red battle flag in defiance, which prompted \"James\" to fire a third shot, hitting Tromp's ship and wounding some crew members. This was followed with Tromp returning fire with a warning broadside from his flagship \"Brederode\". \"James\" in turn fired a broadside and a five-hour battle ensued. The fighting continued until nightfall, where both sides withdrew, the battle having no distinct victor. Shortly after the battle a board of commissioners, which included Cromwell, after questioning witnesses, had concluded that Tromp had deliberately provoked hostilities. Subsequently the Dutch Republic withdrew its three ambassadors from Westminster, and on 8 July 1652 England declared war against the Dutch.\nTromp, with a larger fleet than he had ordered for, sailed to the Downs and found that Blake had made it to the north-east coast, where he set sail for the Thames River. Near the mouth of the river he came upon an English squadron commanded by Sir George Ayscue, which had the advantage of the weather gage, thus preventing Tromp from engaging effectively. Subsequently, Tromp decided to return to the Dutch coast, which was a decision that was not at all well received by the Dutch government, resulting in his removal from command, with Vice-admiral Witte de With taking his place.\nOn 8 October 1652, with Tromp's command still in suspension, de With underestimating Blake, with 60 ships, attempted an attack at the Battle of the Kentish Knock, but ended with Blake sending the defeated de With back to Holland. Although de With was the more adept tactician, he was no match against Blake's force that included the heavy English ships \"Resolution\" and \"Sovereign\", the two largest warships in the world at the time. The significance of De With's defeat was received over-optimistically by the Council of State, leading them to assume that Blake now had control over the English Channel. The Council subsequently dispersed their fleets to protect English interests in the Baltic Sea and North Sea, while another fleet was sent to reinforce the English squadron in the Mediterranean. This left Blake with about forty ships that were in anchor in the Downs, and a situation that was compounded by a lack of funds to pay for badly needed repairs and for the crews.\nSubsequent to de With's defeat, Tromp was reinstated as commander, on 8 May, which proved to be a big boost for Dutch naval morale, which was the highest it had been since he was dismissed months before in July. The Battle of Dungeness occurred on 30 November 1652, and proved to be the most important Dutch victory during the war, with Tromp's fleet winning for the Dutch the temporary control of the English Channel. A great convoy of 300 merchant ships was ready to leave the Netherlands headed for the Bay of Biscay, accompanied by a large fleet of 73 warships and a small number of fireships which were sent in escort to protect it. Tromp was in command, with Jan Evertsen and De Ruyter as his subordinate commanders. Admiral Blake had seriously underestimated Dutch strength, possibly due to poor visibility, as his fleet was outnumbered, two-to-one. Blake, nevertheless, shadowed the Dutch fleet which was sailing parallel along the English coast towards Dungeness, with the coastline beginning to bend to the south. As the fleets were approaching Dungeness Point Blake's fleet became pinned against the shore bringing the two fleets close together. Tromp subsequently hoisted the red battle-flag and advanced on Blake\u2019s new flagship, the \"Triumph\". The battle that developed involved only a part of the Dutch fleet as the winds were preventing the others from engaging in a timely fashion. There was much hand-to-hand fighting that lasted until about 5:00 pm with the advance of nightfall, with the Dutch fleet prevailing, capturing several English ships, while Blake retreated to the mouth of the Thames. Tromp's victory prompted the English navy to issue several major reforms. According to contemporary English sources, after his victory at Dungeness, Tromp attached a broom to his mast as a symbol that he had swept the English from the sea.\nThe naval Battle of the Gabbard, took place on 2\u20133 June 1653, (12\u201313 June 1653 Gregorian calendar) off the coast of Suffolk, England near the Gabbard shoal. Tromp, aboard his flagship \"Brederode\" with de With aboard \"Vrijheid\", was in command of 98 ships and six fireships, divided in five squadrons, while Generals at Sea George Monck and Richard Deane were in command of 100 ships and five fireships, divided into three squadrons. Tromp's fleet was organized mostly for boarding actions and were largely crewed with soldiers for that purpose, while the English employed the use of superior firepower. Blake joined the English fleet on 3 June. Though his fleet was very low on ammunition Tromp decided for a direct attack, but at the time the winds became almost still, leaving the Dutch fleet vulnerable in the face of superior English fire. Subsequently the Dutch lost seventeen ships captured or sunk, while the English lost none. Deane was killed during the action. It was one of the worst defeats ever suffered by the Dutch navy, leaving the English in control of the English Channel.\nDuring the Battle of Scheveningen, the last battle of the war, on 31 July 1653, Tromp was killed by an English sharpshooter in the rigging of William Penn's ship. Tromp's flagship, the \"Brederode\", broke through the English line where an intense battle ensued, resulting in Tromp's imminent death. Tromp's last words were, \"It is all over, O Lord, be merciful to me and thy poor people.\" Members of his crew carried the mortally wounded Tromp below deck to his cabin, where he died. His acting flag captain, Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, on the \"Brederode\" kept up fleet morale by not lowering Tromp's standard, pretending Tromp was still alive. At this point Evertsen assumed command, and with this the Dutch admirals returned to their ships and resumed battle with \"unabated vigour\". The loss of Tromp was a severe blow to the Dutch navy. The battle proved to be a tactical victory for the English, but a strategic victory for the Dutch in that they had the blockade removed.\nLegacy.\nTromp was held in high esteem in the Dutch navy and with the general public. His death was a severe blow to the Dutch navy but also to the Orangists, who sought the replacement of the Commonwealth of England with the House of Stuart. Republican influence strengthened after Scheveningen, which led to peace negotiations with the Commonwealth, culminating in the Treaty of Westminster. He received a state funeral in August 1653 at the Oude Kerk in Delft where a monument was erected to his honour. Tromp, a \"sea hero\", was immensely popular with the Dutch public, a sentiment expressed by poet Joost van den Vondel, who wrote a poem describing the marble grave monument to Tromp in Delft:\n \"Here rests the hero Tromp, the brave protector\"\n \"of shipping and free sea, serving free land\"\n \"his memory alive in artful spectre\"\n \"as if he had just died at his last stand\"\n \"His knell the cries of death, guns' thunderous call\"\n \"a burning Brittany too Great for sea alone\"\n \"He's carved himself an image in the hearts of all\"\n \"more lasting than grave's splendour and its marble stone\"\nTromp was survived by his second son, Cornelis Maartenszoon Tromp (1629-1691), who was also a distinguished naval officer. He later became Commander of the Dutch navy, in the rank of Lieutenant-Admiral-General, after previously having commanded the Danish navy.\nIn the 2015 film \"Michiel de Ruyter\" Maarten Tromp is portrayed by Rutger Hauer.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "62719", "revid": "2559432", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62719", "title": "Line-item veto in the United States", "text": "Practice ruled unconstitutional for the President but allowed for some state governors\nIn United States government, the line-item veto, or partial veto, is the power of an executive authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill, usually a budget appropriations bill, without vetoing the entire legislative package. The line-item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes.\nGovernors.\nForty-four of the 50 U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power; Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the exceptions. The Mayor of Washington, D.C., also has this power.\nWisconsin.\nThe Governor of Wisconsin is empowered with a sweeping line-item veto. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills.\nAccording to scholars, Wisconsin has used four types of extraordinary partial vetoes. The first, the \"digit veto\", was first used by Governor Patrick Lucey in 1973. In appropriation for $25 million, he vetoed the digit 2, resulting in an appropriation of $5 million. Just two years later, Lucey introduced the \"editing veto\". In this instance, the word \"not\" was removed in the phrase \"not less than 50 percent\", thus resulting in the opposite effect than desired by the legislature. In 1983, an even more extreme version, the \"pick-a-letter\" or \"Vanna White veto\" was introduced. Governor Anthony Earl edited a 121-word, five-sentence paragraph down to a one-sentence, 22-word paragraph to change an appeals process from the courts to the Public Service Commission. The final version, the \"reduction veto\", was introduced in 1993 by Governor Tommy Thompson. This resulted in a legislatively-appropriated amount being reduced arbitrarily by the governor. This unprecedented usage has resulted in eight lawsuits and numerous amendment proposals. In the first lawsuit, \"State ex. rel. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry\", the Wisconsin Supreme Court recognized the absolute partial veto power of the Governor as long as a workable, complete law remained, stating the governor had \"the right to pass independently on every separable piece of legislation in an appropriation bill.\"\nIn his first two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 line-item vetoes to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden. The only judicial limitation was \"Risser v. Klauser\", which prohibited the \"reduction veto\", stating that \"the constitution prohibits a write-in veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts.\" In 1990, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the \"Vanna White veto,\" which allowed the governor to strike individual letters within words to create new words. Yet, in 2011, Governor Scott Walker controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension-related section of the budget bill.\nIn 2023, Governor Tony Evers used a line-item veto to extend what was supposed to be a two year temporary funding increase for schools to last over 400 years. In 2025, the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the veto.\nConfederate States.\nArticle 1, Section 7 of the Constitution of the Confederate States, adopted just before the start of the American Civil War, would have granted the President of the Confederate States the ability to \"approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill,\" with such disapprovals returned to the Houses of Congress for reconsideration and potentially for override.\nLine-Item Veto Act of 1996.\nPresidents of the United States have repeatedly asked Congress to give them line-item veto power. According to Louis Fisher in \"The Politics of Shared Power,\" Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1984 State of the Union address, \"Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I'll take the responsibility, I'll make the cut, I'll take the heat.\" Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress granted this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control \"pork barrel spending\", but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6\u20133 decision in \"Clinton v. City of New York\". The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.\nSubsequent developments.\nThough the Supreme Court struck down the Line-Item Veto Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line-item veto power to the Executive Authority. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006, State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006, to the Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senators Bill Frist and John McCain, and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell jointly introduced this proposal. Representative Paul Ryan introduced his own version, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, in March of that year.\nOn that same day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a press conference on the President\u2019s line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out \"wasteful\" spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to withdraw the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.\nWhen asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line-Item Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.\nThough the 2006 line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, called it \"an offensive slap at Congress\", asserting that the legislation would enable the President to intimidate individual members of any Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress\u2019s constitutional \"power of the purse\" and give it to the executive branch.\nOn June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center, testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution's Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.\nH.R. 4890, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act, was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006, by a vote of 24\u20139. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar version was included in the \"Stop Over Spending Act of 2006\", authored by Senator Judd Gregg, in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee, but the full Senate failed to approve it, thereby preventing the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act from becoming law.\nLine Item Veto Re-Enactment Activity of 2009.\nIn 2009, Senators Russ Feingold and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had. This bill was not passed.\nDebate.\nSome scholars, such as Louis Fisher, believe the line-item veto would give presidents too much power over government spending compared with the power of the Congress.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request.\nRARP has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which have much greater feature sets than RARP.\nRARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of mappings of link-layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses. MAC addresses need to be individually configured on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP addresses.\nReverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP), which is designed to obtain the IP address associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier. InARP is not used in Ethernet.\nHistory.\nThe Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) was introduced in the early 1980s to help devices, especially diskless workstations, determine their IP addresses using only their hardware (MAC) addresses. This was a common need in early network environments where local storage was unavailable for IP configuration.\nRARP was specified in RFC 903, published in June 1984 by David C. Plummer. Building on the original Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), RARP reused ARP\u2019s message structure but reversed its function, allowing a device to query a RARP server for its corresponding IP address. The protocol was widely adopted in UNIX-based systems for network booting.\nDespite its utility, RARP had major limitations: It required static mappings, lacked support for additional configuration data, and could not operate across subnets. These drawbacks led to its replacement by more robust protocols like BOOTP and DHCP. Nonetheless, RARP laid the groundwork for later network boot technologies.\nModern day uses.\nAlthough the original uses for RARP have been superseded by different protocols, some modern-day protocols use RARP to handle MAC migration, particularly in virtual machines, using a technique originating in QEMU.\nExamples include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Along with the Baja California peninsula, it had previously comprised the province of , but was made a separate province in 1804 (named ). Following the Mexican War of Independence, it became a territory of Mexico in April 1822 and was renamed in 1824.\nThe territory included all of the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Wyoming, and Colorado. The territory was re-combined with Baja California (as a single ) in Mexico's 1836 \"Siete Leyes\" (Seven Laws) constitutional reform, granting it more autonomy. That change was undone in 1846, but rendered moot by the outcome of the Mexican\u2013American War in 1848, when most of the areas formerly comprising Alta California were ceded to the U.S. in the treaty which ended the war. In 1850, California joined the union as the 31st state.\nThe El Camino Real trail established by the Spanish extended from Mexico City west to Santa Fe, and California, as well as east to Florida. To the southeast, beyond the deserts and the Colorado River, lay the Spanish settlements in Arizona. Spanish soldiers, settlers, and missionaries invaded the homelands of the indigenous peoples of California, people of the Great Basin, and the Pueblo peoples in the establishment of Alta California.\nEvidence of Alta California remains in the numerous Spanish place names of American cities such as Monterey, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Ana, and Santa Rosa.\nHistory.\nPlans for colonization (1697\u20131769).\nFather Eusebio Kino missionized the Pimer\u00eda Alta from 1687 until his death in 1711. In 1697, a Jesuit expansion into California was funded and the Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3 was established that same year. Plans in 1715 by Juan Manuel de Oliv\u00e1n Rebolledo resulted in a 1716 decree for extension of the conquest (of Baja California) which came to nothing. Juan Bautista de Anssa proposed an expedition from Sonora in 1737 and the Council of the Indies planned settlements in 1744, although these plans did not take action.\nDon Fernando S\u00e1nchez Salvador researched the earlier proposals and suggested the area of the Gila and Colorado Rivers as the locale for forts or presidios preventing the French or the English from \"occupying Monterey and invading the neighboring coasts of California which are at the mouth of the Carmel River.\" Alta California was not easily accessible from New Spain: land routes were cut off by deserts and Indigenous peoples who were hostile to invasion. Sea routes ran counter to the southerly currents of the distant northwestern Pacific. Ultimately, New Spain did not have the economic resources nor population to settle such a far northern outpost.\nSpanish interest in colonizing Alta California was revived under the \"visita\" of Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez as part of his plans to completely reorganize the governance of the Interior Provinces and push Spanish settlement further north. In subsequent decades, news of Russian colonization and maritime fur trading in Alaska, and the 1768 naval expedition of Pyotr Krenitsyn and Mikhail Levashov alarmed the Spanish government and served to justify G\u00e1lvez's vision.\nSpanish colonization (1769\u20131821).\nThe Portol\u00e1 expedition was the first European land-entry expedition into the area that is now California. The missionaries and soldiers encountered numerous Indigenous peoples of the area, who became the primary subjects of the expanding Jesuit and Franciscan missions that were already established in Baja California and Baja California Sur. The expedition first established the Presidio of San Diego at the site of the Kumeyaay village of Kosa'aay, which became the first European settlement in the present state of California. At first contact, the villagers provided food and water for the expedition, who were suffering from scurvy and water deprivation.\nThe first Alta California mission was founded that same year adjacent to the village Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1, founded by the Franciscan friar Jun\u00edpero Serra and Gaspar de Portol\u00e1 in San Diego in 1769. Similar to the site of this mission, subsequent missions and presidios were often founded at the site of Indigenous villages. Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel was founded at the Tongva village Toviscanga and the Pueblo de Los \u00c1ngeles at the village of Yaanga. The first settlers of Los Angeles were African and mulatto Catholics, including at least ten of the recently re-discovered Los Pobladores. Mission San Juan Capistrano was founded at the Acjachemen village of Acjacheme. Mission San Fernando was founded at Achooykomenga.\nAs the Spanish and civilian settlers further intruded into Indigenous lands and imposed their practices, ideas of property, and religion onto them backed by the force of soldiers and settlers, Indigenous peoples formed rebellions on Spanish missions and settlements. A major rebellion at Mission San Gabriel in 1785 was led by the medicine woman Toypurina. Runaways from the missions were common, where abuse, malnourishment, and overworking were common features of daily life. Runaways would sometimes find shelter at more distant villages, such as a group of runaways who found refuge at the Vanyume village of W\u00e1'peat, the chief of which refused to give them up. Many children died young at the missions. One missionary reported that 3 of every 4 children born at Mission San Gabriel died before reaching the age of two.\nThe precolonial Indigenous population of California is estimated to have numbered around 340,000 people, who were diverse culturally and linguistically. From 1769 to 1832, at least 87,787 baptisms and 63,789 deaths of Indigenous peoples occurred, demonstrating the immense death rate at the missions in Alta California. Conversion to Christianity at the colonial missions was often resisted by Indigenous peoples in Alta California. Many missionaries in the province wrote of their frustrations with teaching Indigenous people to internalize Catholic scripture and practice. Many Indigenous people learned to navigate religious expectations at the missions with complex social behaviors in order to maintain their cultural and religious practices.\nEstablishment of ranchos.\nIn 1784, the Spanish established the first rancho, Rancho San Pedro, as a 48,000-acre site for cattle grazing. Nine ranchos were subsequently established before 1800. Spanish, and later Mexican, governments rewarded retired \"soldados de cuera\" with large land grants, known as \"ranchos\", for the raising of cattle and sheep. Hides and tallow from the livestock were the primary exports of California until the mid-19th century. Similar to the missions, the construction, ranching and domestic work on these vast estates was primarily done by Indigenous peoples, who learned to speak Spanish and ride horses. Under Spanish and Mexican rule, the ranchos prospered and grew. \"Rancheros\" (cattle ranchers) and \"pobladores\" (townspeople) evolved into the unique Californio culture.\nBy law, mission land and property were to pass to the Indigenous population after a period of about ten years, when the Indigenous people would become Spanish subjects. In the interim period, the Franciscans were to act as mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Indigenous residents. The Franciscans, however, prolonged their control over the missions even after control of Alta California passed from Spain to independent Mexico, and continued to run the missions until they were secularized, beginning in 1833. The transfer of property never occurred under the Franciscans.\nAs the number of Spanish settlers grew in Alta California, the boundaries and natural resources of the mission properties became disputed. Conflicts between the Crown and the Church arose over land. State and ecclesiastical bureaucrats debated over authority of the missions. The Franciscan priests of Mission Santa Clara de As\u00eds sent a petition to the governor in 1782 which stated that the Mission Indians owned both the land and cattle and represented the Ohlone against the Spanish settlers in nearby San Jos\u00e9. The priests reported that Indians' crops were being damaged by the pueblo settlers' livestock and that the settlers' livestock was also \"getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission\" causing losses. They advocated that the Indigenous people be allowed to own property and have the right to defend it.\nProvince of Alta California.\nIn 1804, due to the growth of the Spanish population in new northern settlements, the province of Las Californias was divided just south of San Diego, following mission president Francisco Pal\u00f3u's division between the Dominican and Franciscan jurisdictions. Governor Diego de Borica is credited with defining the border between Alta (upper) and Baja (lower) California's as Pal\u00f3u's division, while the division became the political reality under Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Arrillaga, who would become the first governor of Alta California.\nThe \"cortes\" (legislature) of New Spain issued a decree in 1813 for at least partial secularization that affected all missions in America and was to apply to all outposts that had operated for ten years or more; however, the decree was never enforced in California.\nThe Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty of 1819, between the United States and Spain, established the northern limit of Alta California at latitude 42\u00b0N, which remains the boundary between the states of California, Nevada and Utah (to the south) and Oregon and Idaho (to the north) to this day. Mexico won independence in 1821, and Alta California became a territory of Mexico the next year.\nIndependent Mexico (1821\u20131846).\nMexico gained independence from Spain on August\u00a024,\u00a01821, upon conclusion of the decade-long Mexican War of Independence. As the successor state to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Mexico automatically included the provinces of Alta California and Baja California as territories. Alta California declared allegiance to the new Mexican nation and elected a representative to be sent to Mexico City. On November 9, 1822, the first legislature of California was created, the Diputaci\u00f3n de Alta California. With the establishment of a republican government in 1824, Alta California, like many northern territories, was not recognized as one of the constituent States of Mexico because of its small population. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico refers to Alta California as a \"territory\".\nSecularization of the missions (1833).\nResentment was increasing toward appointed territorial governors sent from Mexico City, who came with little knowledge of local conditions and concerns. Laws were imposed by the central government without much consideration of local conditions, such as the Mexican secularization act of 1833, causing friction between governors and the people.\nIn 1836, Mexico repealed the 1824 federalist constitution and adopted a more centralist political organization (under the \"Seven Laws\") that reunited Alta and Baja California in a single California Department (). The change, however, had little practical effect in far-off Alta California. The capital of Alta California remained Monterey, as it had been since the 1769 Portola expedition first established a military/civil government, and the local political structures were unchanged.\nThe friction came to a head in 1836, when Monterey-born Juan Bautista Alvarado led a revolt against the 1836 constitution, seizing control of Monterey from Nicol\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez. Alvarado's actions nearly led to a civil war with loyalist forces based in Los Angeles, but a ceasefire was arranged. After an unsettled period, Alvarado agreed to support the 1839 constitution, and Mexico City appointed him to serve as governor from 1837 to 1842. Other \"Californio\" governors followed, including Carlos Antonio Carrillo, and P\u00edo Pico. The last non-Californian governor, Manuel Micheltorena, was driven out after another rebellion in 1845. Micheltorena was replaced by P\u00edo Pico, last Mexican governor of California, who served until 1846 when the U.S. military occupation began.\nMexican\u2013American War (1846\u20131848).\nIn the final decades of Mexican rule, American and European immigrants arrived and settled in the former Alta California. Those in Southern California mainly settled in and around the established coastal settlements and tended to intermarry with the Californios. In Northern California, they mainly formed new settlements further inland, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and these immigrants focused on fur-trapping and farming and kept apart from the Californios.\nIn 1846, following reports of the annexation of Texas to the United States, American settlers in inland Northern California took up arms, captured the Mexican garrison town of Sonoma, and declared independence there as the California Republic. At the same time, the United States and Mexico had gone to war, and forces of the United States Navy entered into Alta California and took possession of the northern port cities of Monterey and San Francisco. The forces of the California Republic, upon encountering the United States Navy and, from them, learning of the state of war between Mexico and the United States, abandoned their independence and proceeded to assist the United States forces in securing the remainder of Alta California. The California Republic was never recognized by any nation and existed for less than one month, but its flag (the \"Bear Flag\") survives as the flag of the State of California.\nAfter the United States Navy's seizure of the cities of southern California, the Californios formed irregular units, which were victorious in the Siege of Los Angeles, and after the arrival of the United States Army, fought in the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Dom\u00ednguez Rancho. But the Californios were defeated in subsequent encounters, the battles of R\u00edo San Gabriel and La Mesa. The southern Californios formally surrendered with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. After twenty-seven years as part of independent Mexico, California was ceded to the United States in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The United States paid Mexico $15 million for the lands ceded.\nPueblos.\nThree civilian settlements (\"pueblos\") were officially granted municipal status, recognized by the government. \nHistoric population figures.\nPopulation statistics of Alta California Province.\nThe data in this table includes California, Nevada, Utah and parts of Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This was one of two major works in proof theory in the 1920s and the only one following Hilbert's school of thought. From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in Burgsteinfurt, and then at L\u00fcdenscheid until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (\"Academy of Sciences\") in G\u00f6ttingen, and was an honorary professor at the University of M\u00fcnster.\nIn 1928, Ackermann helped David Hilbert turn his 1917 \u2013 22 lectures on introductory mathematical logic into a text, \"Principles of Mathematical Logic\". This text contained the first exposition ever of first-order logic, and posed the problem of its completeness and decidability (Entscheidungsproblem). Ackermann went on to construct consistency proofs for set theory (1937), full arithmetic (1940), type-free logic (1952), and a new axiomatization of set theory (1956).\nLater in life, Ackermann continued working as a high school teacher. He kept engaged in the field of research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life. He died in L\u00fcdenscheid, West Germany in December 1962.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
