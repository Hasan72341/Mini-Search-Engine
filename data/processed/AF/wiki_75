There are several buildings on the island, the largest being the Art Deco Burgh Island Hotel. The other buildings are three private houses, and a pub, the Pilchard Inn, which dates to the 14th century. The island is strongly associated with writer Agatha Christie, who often visited and used the island and its hotel as a setting and inspiration for two famous novels: \"And Then There Were None\" (1939) and \"Evil Under the Sun\" (1941).\nHistory.\nArchaeological discovery of tin ingots at the River Erme estuary wreck show that the local area was a significant tin trading port in ancient times; it is unclear whether the ingots date from the Iron Age or Sub-Roman periods, however this discovery so close to Burgh Island has drawn comparisons with Diodorus Siculus's 1st century BCE text, more often associated with St Michael's Mount in Cornwall:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;At this time we shall treat of the tin which is dug from the ground. Those who dwell near Belerium, one of the headlands of Britain, are especially fond of strangers, and on account of their trade with the merchants they have a more civilised manner of living. They collect the tin after the earth has been skillfully forced to yield it. Although the land is stony, it has certain veins of earth from which they melt and purify the metal which has been extracted. After making this into bars they carry it to a certain island near Britain called Ictis. For although the place between is for the most part covered with water, yet in the middle there is dry ground, and over this they carry a great amount of tin in wagons [...] Thence the merchants carry into Gaul the tin which they have bought from the inhabitants. And after a journey of thirty days on foot through Gaul, they convey their packs carried by horses to the mouths of the Rhone River.\nThe island has been known by various names over the years. Early records and maps mention it as St Michael's Island. The name later changed to Borough Island, eventually shortened to Burgh. As late as 1947 an Ordnance Survey map refers to the island as Borough Island. In 1908 a postcard produced by Stengel &amp; Co Ltd of London referred to it as Burr Island. A map published in 1765 shows \"Borough or Bur Isle\".\nIt is believed a monastery was established on the island, most of the remains of which may lie beneath the current hotel. The ancient \"Pilchard Inn's\" history dates to 1336 and may have started life as the guest lodgings for the monastery.\nA small, possibly transient, population of fishermen occupied the island following the dissolution of the monastery, specialising in pilchard fishing. There are the remains of a chapel atop the island, which later became a \"huers hut\" \u2014 a place where fishermen would make a \"hue and cry\" call to inform other fishermen of shoals of pilchards. During this period, smuggling, wrecking, and piracy were common, benefiting from a natural barrier for half the day.\nFear that German landing forces might use the island as a beachhead during World War II resulted in the area's fortification with anti-tank defences and two pillboxes, positioned on both sides of the causeway. An observation post was also established on the summit to monitor the coastline.\nA beach house was built for Agatha Christie as a writer's retreat and still exists on the island.\nThe hotel.\nBurgh Island is well-known today as the location of a restored 1930s Art Deco-style hotel.\nNotable setting and visitors.\nBurgh Island is closely linked to Agatha Christie, as it served as the inspirational setting for Soldier Island (\"And Then There Were None\") and for the setting of the Hercule Poirot mystery \"Evil Under the Sun\". The 2002 TV adaptation of \"Evil Under The Sun\" used the island as a filming location. In 1994 an episode of the television series \"Lovejoy\" was set and filmed on the island, entitled \"Somewhere - Over the Rainbow?\" Several scenes from the BBC's 1987 dramatisation of Christie's Miss Marple mystery, \"Nemesis,\" were also filmed in the hotel.\nThe hotel, with its Art Deco styling, was also a bolt hole in the 1930s for some of London's rich and famous, including No\u00ebl Coward. The hotel has had many other famous visitors, from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to The Beatles.\nThe island was also the location for GMTV's \"Inch-loss Island\" slimming feature in 2008, as it was for the original series in 2001. The climactic scene of the 1965 British film \"Catch Us If You Can\" (featuring The Dave Clark Five) takes place at the island.\nEnglish singer-songwriter Ben Howard's 2012 EP was named after the island.\nTransport.\nThe island is approximately from the mainland at Bigbury-on-Sea and is approachable on foot at low tide. At high tide, the sea tractor, which is operated by the hotel, transports passengers back and forth. The original vehicle was constructed in 1930 (see 1933 https://); the current third generation tractor dates from 1969. The vehicle drives across the beach with its wheels underwater on the sandy bottom while its driver and passengers sit on a platform high above. Power from a Fordson tractor engine is relayed to the wheels via hydraulic motors.\nFootpaths.\nThe island has an extensive network of footpaths and the owner until 2003 was a keen hiker who welcomed walkers. The new owners, however, erected signs closing footpaths and obtained an exemption from the public \"rights to roam\" enabled in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The exemption was overturned, except for the routes closest to the hotel, in 2006.\nSale.\nIn April 2018, the owners of the island, Deborah Clark and Tony Orchard, announced that the island had been bought by \"Project Archie\", a joint venture between Bluehone Capital and Marechale Capital, for an undisclosed sum.\nIn May 2023, the island went up for sale again.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69385", "revid": "8880", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69385", "title": "Rahab", "text": "Biblical figure\nRahab (; ) was a prostitute from Jericho during the Israelite conquest of Canaan. In the Book of Joshua of the Hebrew Bible, she is accredited with aiding the Israelites by hiding two spies who had been sent by Joshua to scout the city before the Israelite assault. Her actions led to the fall of Jericho, during which Israelite fighters killed every Canaanite inhabitant of the city.\nIn the New Testament, she is lauded both as an example of a saint who lived by faith, and as someone \"considered righteous\" for her good works. According to biblical research, the narrative's author intended that she did not contribute to the fall of Jericho, but instead saved herself and her loved ones from certain death.\nThe King James Version renders the name as \"Rachab\" after the spelling in Koine Greek, which differs from the spelling for Rahab in the Epistle of James and the Epistle to the Hebrews. Most modern Bible translations render it as \"Rahab\", ignoring the distinction.\nRahab's profession.\nThe Hebrew term , used to describe Rahab in Joshua 2:1, literally means \"a prostitute woman\". While the Talmud holds to that interpretation, some sources in Rabbinic literature insist she was an innkeeper, based on Targum Jonathan and other texts (.) Rahab's name is presumably the shortened form of a sentence-name \"r\u0101\u1e25\u0101b-N\" (\"the god \"N\" has opened/widened [the womb?])\". The Hebrew term \"zon\u0101\" may refer to secular or sacred prostitution; the latter was widely believed to have been an element of Canaanite religion, although recent scholarship has disputed this. However, there was a separate word, \"q\u01dd\u1e0f\u0113\u0161\u0101\", that allegedly designated ritual prostitutes.\nJosephus mentions that Rahab kept an inn but is silent as to whether merely renting out rooms was her only source of income. It was not uncommon for both an inn and a brothel to operate within the same building; thus, entering Rahab's quarters was not necessarily a deviation from Joshua's orders. Indeed, as Robert Boling notes, such an establishment might have represented an ideal location for spies to gather intelligence. Several scholars have noted that the narrator in Joshua 2 may have intended to remind the readers of the \"immemorial symbiosis between military service and bawdy house\".\nIn the New Testament, the Epistle of James and the Epistle to the Hebrews follow the tradition set by the translators of the Septuagint in using the Greek word \"p\u00f3rn\u0113\", which is usually translated to English as \"harlot, prostitute\", to describe Rahab.\nWilliam L. Lyons observed that biblical interpreters have viewed Rahab as a model of hospitality, mercy, faith, patience, and repentance in her interaction with Joshua's spies. The harlot of Jericho became a paragon of virtue.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nAccording to the book of Joshua, when the Hebrews were encamped at Shittim in the Arabah or Jordan Valley opposite Jericho, ready to cross the river, Joshua, as a final preparation, sent out two spies to investigate the military strength of Jericho. The spies stayed in Rahab's house, which was built into the city wall. The soldiers sent to capture the spies asked Rahab to bring out the spies. Instead, she hid them under bundles of flax on the roof. It was the time of the barley harvest, and flax and barley are ripe at the same time in the Jordan valley, so that \"the bundles of flax stalks might have been expected to be drying just then\".\nRahab told the spies: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;She said to the men, \u201cI know that GOD has given the country to you, because dread of you has fallen upon us, and all the inhabitants of the land are quaking before you. For we have heard how GOD dried up the waters of the Sea of Reeds for you when you left Egypt, and what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings across the Jordan, whom you doomed. When we heard about it, we lost heart, and no one had any more spirit left because of you; for the ETERNAL your God is the only God in heaven above and on earth below. Now, since I have shown loyalty to you, swear to me by GOD that you in turn will show loyalty to my family. Provide me with a reliable sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death.\u201d\u2014\u200a\nAfter escaping, the spies promised to spare Rahab and her family after taking the city, even if there should be a massacre, if she would mark her house by hanging a red cord out the window. Some have claimed that the symbol of the red cord is related to the practice of the red-light district.\nWhen the city of Jericho fell, Rahab and her whole family were preserved according to the promise of the spies and were counted among the Israelites. According to some rabbinic authorities, Rahab was treated as a beautiful captive woman in order to bring her into a marital union with Israel. (In siege warfare of antiquity, a city that fell after a prolonged siege was commonly subjected to a massacre and sack, while others were taken captive.)\nTikva Frymer-Kensky regards Rahab as \"smart, proactive, tricky and unafraid to disobey and deceive her king\". She also credits Rahab with being \"one of Israel\u2019s early saviors\" due to \"her allegiance to God and Israel\". As the first non-Israelite person, and in particular the first Canaanite woman, to ally with Israel, Rahab's convictions led her to protect the men sent by Joshua despite her background.\nMichael Coogan says the book of Joshua, more than any other book of the Bible, contains short etiological narratives that explain the origins of religious rituals, topographical features, genealogical relationships, and other aspects of ancient Israelite life, and that the legend of Rahab is such an example. The story of Rahab, as faithful, was counted as an Israelite, and not part of the Deuteronomistic injunction to kill all Canaanites and not to intermarry with them.\nSome scholars see the parallels between Joshua 2 and Genesis 19, which narrates the fall of Sodom and Gomorrah. Like Sodom and Gomorrah, Jericho was presumed to be equally as wicked, with Rahab challenging Jericho's \"oppressive establishment\" by siding with Jericho's destroyers (i.e. the Israelites). Coincidentally, these cities were believed to lie among a major fault line extending 1,100 kilometers from the Red Sea to Turkey.\nIn rabbinic literature.\nIn the midrash, Rahab is named as one of the four most beautiful women the world has ever known, along with Sarah, Abigail, and Esther. In the Babylonian Talmud, Rahab was so beautiful that the very mention of her name could cause arousal (\"Megillah\" 15a). Rahab is said to have converted at the age of 50, after practising prostitution for 40 years, and repented according to three sins, saying:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Master of the Universe! I have sinned with three things [with my eye, my thigh, and my stomach]. By the merit of three things pardon me: the rope, the window, and the wall [pardon me for engaging in harlotry because I endangered myself when I lowered the rope for the spies from the window in the wall].\" (Babylonian Talmud, Zevahim 116a\u2013b).\nA similar tradition has Rahab declaring, \"Pardon me by merit of the rope, the window, and the flaxen [the stalks of flax under which she concealed the spies].\"\nBecause of this, rabbis interpret Biblical verses that talk about the citizens of Jericho \"melting in fear\", such as and , as describing their inability to maintain erections upon hearing Israelite military victories. Rahab knew this because \"there was no minister or prince that did not pay a visit to Rahab the harlot\".\nThe rabbis viewed Rahab as a worthy convert, and attested that following her conversion, Rahab married Joshua, and their descendants included the prophets Jeremiah, Hilkiah, Seraiah, Mahseiah, Baruch, Ezekiel and the prophetess Hulda, although there is no report in the book of Joshua of the leader marrying anyone, or having any family life. Rahab often is mentioned alongside Jethro (Yitro) and Na'aman as \"positive examples\" of the converts who joined Israel, and another midrash has Rahab acting as an advocate for all nations of the world.\nSome believe that the genealogies described in and served to dispel accusations that Jeremiah and Ezekiel were descendants of Rahab. At the time, the Israelites discriminated against these prophets for this alleged heritage.\nIn the New Testament.\nIn the New Testament, Rahab (Greek \"\u1fec\u03b1\u03ac\u03b2\") of the Book of Joshua is mentioned as an example of a person of faith and of good works. Rahab is referred to as \"the harlot\" in each of these passages.\nA different spelling of the name, \"Rachab\" (as transliterated in the King James translation of the Greek \"\u1fec\u03b1\u03c7\u03ac\u03b2\") is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew as one of the ancestors of Jesus (). She married Salmon of the Tribe of Judah and was the mother of Boaz. Most other English Bibles transcribe her name as \"Rahab\".\nSome have conjectured that Jesus invoked the name of \"Rahab\" () by writing it in the sand when he protected the adulteress from stoning (John 8:6). Through this act he would have reminded the hypocritical Pharisees of the righteous prostitute in their own ancestry.\nIn fiction.\nFictional accounts of Rahab's life\nTelevision portrayals\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was named by the explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 and is Dutch for \"large island\" in archaic spelling. The modern Dutch spelling is \"Groot Eiland\".\nThe original inhabitants of Groote Eylandt are the Anindilyakwa people (also known as Warnindhilyagwa), an Aboriginal Australian people, who speak the Anindilyakwa language (also known as Amamalya Ayakwa). They consist of 14 clan groups which make up the two moieties on the island. The clans maintain their traditions and have strong ties with the people in the community of Numbulwar and on Bickerton Island. The island's population was 2,811 in the 2016 census.\nThere are four communities on Groote Eylandt. The mining company GEMCO established the township of Alyangula for its workers. The three main Aboriginal communities are Angurugu and Umbakumba, and Milyakburra on Bickerton Island. There are also a number of outstations on the island.\nThe Anindilyakwa Land Council is one of four land councils in the Northern Territory. It is a representative body with statutory authority under the \"Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976\" and has responsibilities under the \"Native Title Act 1993\" and the \"Pastoral Land Act 1992\".\nGeography.\nGroote Eylandt lies about offshore from the Northern Territory mainland (i.e. the east coast of Arnhem Land), about from Darwin, opposite Blue Mud Bay. The island measures about from east to west and from north to south; its area is . It is generally quite low-lying, with an average height above sea level of , although Central Hill reaches an elevation of .\nPolitics and administration.\nElectorates.\nGroote Eylandt is part of the federal electorate of Lingiari, for which the current member is Marion Scrymgour, who replaced the inaugural member Warren Snowdon at the 2022 Australian federal election. The island is within the Northern Territory electoral division of Arnhem. The current member for Arnhem is Labor Party member Selena Uibo, whose mother is a Nunggubuyu and Anindilyakwa woman.\nLocal government.\nWith Bickerton Island and a few smaller satellite islands, Groote Eylandt forms Anindilyakwa Ward of East Arnhem Region. It contains the communities of Angurugu, Alyangula, Umbakumba, Yadagba District, Uburamudja District and Sandy Hill (Groote Eylandt) and Milyakburra District (Bickerton Island).\nOutside the local government, subdivision is the mining company GEMCO town of Alyangula, an unincorporated territory within the Northern Region of Northern Territory.\nEnvironment.\nThe whole of Groote Eylandt and its surrounding waters lie within the Anindilyakwa Indigenous Protected Area. BirdLife International has classified an unnamed islet off the north-eastern coast as an important bird area because of its global importance as a roseate tern breeding site.\nGroote Eylandt has a variety of habitats: dense stands on monsoon forests rising behind coastal sand dunes, alternating with mangrove and mudflats. Sandstone outcrops and laterite provide excellent niches for shellfish.\nFauna.\nThe island hosts 27 species of native mammal, making it the third most mammal diverse Australian island after Melville Island and Tasmania.\nFishing.\nUntil recently, the island had been open to the public only with permission, and the local Aboriginal Land Council did not encourage tourism. There is now a resort-style hotel on the island, and visitors are welcome. The island is becoming renowned for its fine Aboriginal rock art sites, arts and crafts and outstanding sport-fishing, including sailfish, marlin, tuna, Spanish mackerel, giant trevally, queenfish, and coral trout.\nHistory.\nTraditional owners.\nThe traditional owners of Groote Eylandt, the Anindilyakwa people, have 14 clan groups, which make up the two moieties on Groote Eylandt. The Anindilyakwa people have inhabited the island for thousands of years. The clans maintain their traditions and have strong ties with the people in the community of Numbulwar and on Bickerton Island.\nIn 1856, the Jurambunga tribe, a local aboriginal conglomerate would regularly pass the island.\nMacassan traders.\nThere had been regular contact between local Aboriginal people and Macassan traders who would visit the area searching for trepang from around the early to mid-1700s. They introduced culinary delights such as tamarinds, chilli and beer. The trade continued until the Australian Government introduced the White Australia Policy in 1906.\nThere is still evidence of the Macassans, such as the wild tamarind trees, which the traders introduced to the area. Some Groote Eylandt settlements, such as Umbakumba, can trace their names back to Macassan origin.\nMachado-Joseph Disease (MJD).\nThe first recorded European sighting of Groote Eylandt was in 1623, by the Dutch ship \"Arnhem\", under Willem van Coolsteerdt. However, the relative prevalence of the hereditary Machado-Joseph Disease (MJD) in the Groote Eylandt community (a condition otherwise mainly found in the Azores) was previously suggested as evidence of early contact with Portuguese sailors. (Contact with Chinese traders has also been suggested as a cause.) Recent genetic studies showed that the Groote Eylandt families with MJD shared a haplogroup with some families from Taiwanese, Indian, and Japanese families.\nEuropean Colonisation.\nChurch Mission Society.\nThe first European settlement on the island was a Christian mission established by the Church Missionary Society at Emerald River in 1921. In 1943, after a cyclone swept through the mission, CMS decided to move the settlement south of the Angurugu River. The local Anindilyakwa people called the chosen location \"Mungwardinamanja\". However, as it was difficult for the European missionaries to pronounce, the local Anindilyakwa men guiding them chose the name of the Angurugu River mouth \"Angurrkwa\", which was later Anglicised to Angurugu.\nUmbakumba.\nMr Fred H. Gray, a pearl and trepang trader, established the Umbakumba Native Settlement on an old Macassan trading post in 1938. The place-name itself \"Umbakumba\" comes from the Malay word \"ombak-ombak\", which means \u2018lapping of waves\u2019. He used the settlement as a base for trepanging and employed many of the Aboriginal locals during the 20s and 30s.\nWorld War II.\nDuring World War II, in 1943, the mission moved to Angurugu, as the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) required the use of the mission's airstrip: the ruins of the RAAF base are still evident today. Qantas used the island as a flying boat base.\nFollowing the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, Groote Eylandt was converted to Aboriginal freehold title land. In 1979, control of the island was transferred to the local Aboriginal Town Council.\nManganese mining.\nGroote Eylandt Mining Company.\nThe majority of Australia's manganese reserves are located on the western side of Groote Eylandt and the deposits there comprise oolitic and pisolitic sedimentary manganese and sit within the Cretaceous Carpentaria Basin. Special mining leases were granted to the Groote Eylandt Mining Company (GEMCO) and it has been in operation since 25 July 1964 near the community of Angurugu and, as a part of its establishment, the town of Alyangula was built as a residence for mine workers in the late 1960s. GEMCO it is a wholly owned subsidiary of BHP but has become a part of South32 since 18 May 2015. \nThe mine produces more than annually\u00a0\u2013 about a quarter of the world's total and, as of \u00a02023[ [update]], it has produced more than of manganese ore and concentrate.\nConcerns have been raised by many community members that this mining, and the resulting dust, posed a significant risk to their health and monitoring has been in place since 2017; South32 does not dispute these readings or provide its own monitoring data. The World Health Organization advised that breathing even low levels of manganese can damage brain functions relating to dexterity and also damage respiratory and reproductive systems. To investigate the possible impacts on humans studies are being undertaken at the University of Queensland.\nSylvia Tkac, an Anindilyakwa woman, who used to work at the mine said of it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We are worried about the future of our children, so we'd like them to do more testing and we'd like to know what positive programs they can put in place to stop this dust.\u2014\u200a\nStudies have also taken place looking at the impacts on the ecosystem; this includes specific studies looking at the impact of northern quolls (Dasyurus hallucatus) living in the area.\nMining rights are renewed every 21 years, with operations expected to continue until at least 2027.\nIn March 2024 a carrier of the manganese ore, MV Anikitos, caused significant damage to the mines port during Cyclone Megan; this did not lead to a fuel leak but did, temporarily, halt production.\nWinchelsea Mining.\nIn 2019 Wichelsea Mining was granted an exploration license covering part of Winchelsea Island (Akwamburrkba), which is off the northwestern coast of Groote Eylandt. This company is a joint venture between the Anindilyakwa Advancement Aboriginal Corporation (AAAC) and AUS China International Mining and, in December 2020, they applied for a stage open cut mine plan and in 2024 they completed works on accommodation at the site.\nThis mine is part of a strategy to make the residents of Groote Eylandt economically independent and Anindilyakwa Land Council chair, Tony Wurramarrba, says of it:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Nobody would have thought it possible for Traditional Owners to mine their own land in an environmentally, well-managed way. But that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. It will create the wealth for us to be able to stand on our own feet.\u2014\u200a\nPresent-day.\nOn 20 May 2008, the federal government signed a deal with local Aboriginal people from Groote Eylandt to lease land to the government for 40 years. In return, the government will spend money in the community to improve housing, education, and health in the area.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is separated from the Isle of Man by a narrow stretch of water called the Calf Sound.\nLike the nearby rocky islets of Chicken Rock and Kitterland, it is part of the historic parish of Rushen and the current parish district of Arbory and Rushen. It has only two seasonal inhabitants. The word 'calf' derives from the Old Norse word \"kalfr\", which means a small island lying near a larger one. One can reach the Calf of Man by boat from either Port Erin or Port St Mary. Cow Harbour and South Harbour are the main landing places. The highest part of the island is in the west where an unnamed peak reaches above sea level.\nUntil 1939, the island was under private ownership by the Keig family, but the island was purchased by Mr F. J. Dickens of Silverdale, Lancashire, who then donated it to the National Trust for it to become a bird sanctuary. In 1951, the Manx Museum &amp; National Trust, which became known as Manx National Heritage, was established. Manx National Heritage then rented the Calf from the National Trust for a nominal \u00a31 per year, until 1986, when ownership was transferred. In 2006 Manx National Heritage employed the charity Manx Wildlife Trust as the Calf Warden Service Provider, but it retains ownership.\nThe island has been a bird observatory since 1959, and welcomes visits from volunteers and ornithologists. The observatory is able to accommodate up to eight visitors in basic self-catering accommodation, which can be booked through Manx National Heritage.\nThe Calf of Man and its offshore rocks have no fewer than four lighthouses: two lighthouses were built in 1818 under the Isle of Man and Calf of Man Lighthouses Act 1815 (55 Geo. 3. c. lxvii) by Robert Stevenson to warn mariners of the hazards of the Chicken Rock off the south end of the Calf. These were replaced in 1875 by a lighthouse built on the Chicken Rock itself. In 1968, a third lighthouse was built on the Calf after a severe fire destroyed the Chicken Rock light. The Chicken Rock lighthouse was later rebuilt. There are two minor, unfenced roads on the island, and two very short streams.\nBetween the Isle of Man and the Calf is the islet of Kitterland, while the islets of The Burroo and The Stack lie close to the Calf's shore. The southern shore of the island encloses a small bay called The Puddle. Almost a mile southwest of the Calf is Chicken Rock, the most southerly part of the Isle of Man's territory.\nCalf of Man is home to a breeding population of Manx shearwaters, a seabird which derives its name from its presence in Manx waters. The Calf of Man also has a large colony of seals which live and breed on the rocky coastline.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69398", "revid": "526174", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69398", "title": "Delta Works", "text": "Series of construction projects in the Netherlands\nThe Delta Works () is a series of construction projects in the southwest of the Netherlands to protect a large area of land around the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta from the sea. Constructed between 1954 and 1997, the works consist of dams, sluices, locks, dykes, levees, and storm surge barriers located in the provinces of South Holland and Zeeland.\nThe aim of the dams, sluices, and storm surge barriers was to shorten the Dutch coastline, thus reducing the number of dikes that had to be raised. Along with the Zuiderzee Works, the Delta Works have been declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers.\nHistory.\nAuthorities were aware of the flooding risks in the south of the country, but due to indecision and the Second World War, little action was taken. In 1950 two small estuary mouths, the Brielse Gat near Brielle and the Botlek near Vlaardingen were dammed. After the North Sea flood of 1953, a Delta Works Commission was installed to research the causes and develop measures to prevent such disasters in future. They revised some of the old plans and came up with the \"Deltaplan\".\nDelta law and conceptual framework.\nAn important part of this project was fundamental research to come up with long-term solutions, protecting the Netherlands against future floods. Instead of analysing past floods and building protection sufficient to deal with those, the Delta Works commission pioneered a conceptual framework to use as norm for investment in flood defences.\nThe framework is called the 'Delta norm'; it includes the following principles:\nThe most important \"dike ring area\" is the South Holland coast region. It is home to four million people, most of whom live below normal sea level. The loss of human life in a catastrophic flood here can be very large because there is typically little warning time with North Sea storms. Comprehensive evacuation is not a realistic option for the Holland coastal region.\nThe commission initially set the acceptable risk for complete failure of every \"dike ring\" in the country at 1 in 125,000 years. But, it found that the cost of building to this level of protection could not be supported. It set \"acceptable\" risks by region as follows:\nRiver flooding causes less damage than salt water flooding, which causes long-term damage to agricultural lands. Areas at risk from river flooding were assigned a higher acceptable risk. River flooding also has a longer warning time, producing a lower estimated death toll per event.\nThese acceptable risks were enshrined in the Delta Law (Dutch: \"Deltawet\"). This required the government to keep risks of catastrophic flooding within these limits and to upgrade defences should new insights into risks require this. The limits have also been incorporated into the new Water Law (\"Waterwet\"), effective from 22 December 2009.\nThe Delta Project (of which the Delta Works are a part) has been designed with these guidelines in mind. All other primary defences have been upgraded to meet the norm. New data elevating the risk assessment on expected sea level rise due to global warming has identified ten 'weak points.' These have been upgraded to meet future demands. The latest upgrades are made under the High Water Protection Program.\nAlterations to the plan during the execution of the Works.\nDuring the execution of the works, changes were made in response to public pressure. In the Nieuwe Waterweg, the heightening and the associated widening of the dikes proved very difficult because of public opposition to the planned destruction of important historic buildings to achieve this. The plan was changed to the construction of a storm surge barrier (the Maeslantkering) and dikes were only partly built up.\nThe storm-surge barrier.\nThe Delta Plan originally intended to create a large freshwater lake, the \"\" (Zeeland Lake). This would have caused major environmental destruction in Oosterschelde, with the total loss of the saltwater ecosystem and, consequently, the harvesting of oysters. Environmentalists and fishermen combined their efforts to prevent the closure; they persuaded parliament to amend the original plan. Instead of completely damming the estuary, the government agreed to build a storm surge barrier. This essentially is a long collection of very large valves that can be closed against storm surges.\nThe storm surge barrier closes only when the sea-level is expected to rise 3 metres above mean sea level. Under normal conditions, the estuary's mouth is open, and salt water flows in and out with the tide. As a result of the change, the weak dikes along the Oosterschelde needed to be strengthened. Over 200\u00a0km of the dike needed new revetments. The connections between the Eastern Scheldt and the neighboring Haringvliet had to be dammed to limit the effect of the salt water. Extra dams and locks were needed at the east part of the Oosterschelde to create a shipping route between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp. Since operating the barrier has an effect on the environment, fisheries and the water management system, decisions made on opening or closing the gate are carefully considered. Also the safety of the surrounding dykes are affected by barrier operations.\nEnvironmental policy implementations.\nIn an attempt to restore and preserve the natural system surrounded by the dykes and storm-surge barrier, the concept 'building with nature' was introduced in revised Delta Program updates after 2008. The new integrated water management plan not only takes into account protection against flooding, but also covers water quality, leisure industry, economic activities, shipping, environment and nature. Whenever possible, existing engineering constructions would be replaced by more 'nature friendly' options in an attempt to restore natural estuary and tides, while still protecting against flooding. In addition, building components of the reinforcements are designed in a way that they support formation of entire ecosystems. As part of the revision, the Room for the River projects, enabled nature to occupy space by lowering or widening the river bed. In order to establish this, agricultural flood plains are turned into natural parks, excavated farmland is used for wild vegetation and newly excavated lakes and bypasses create habitats for fish and birds. Along the coast, natural sand is added each year to allow sand to blow freely through the dunes instead of having the dunes held in place by planted vegetation or revetments. Although the new plan brought along additional cost, it was received favourably. The re-considerations of the Delta Project indicated the growing importance of integrate environmental impact assessments in policy-making.\nEnvironmental effects.\nThe Delta Project of which the Delta Works are part of was originally designed in a period of time when environmental awareness and ecological effects of engineering projects were barely taken into consideration. Although the level of awareness for the environment grew throughout the years, the Delta Project has caused numerous irreversible effects on the environment in the past. Blocking the estuary mouths did reduce the length of dykes that otherwise would have to be built to protect against floods, but it also led to major changes in the water systems. For example, the tides disappeared, which resulted in a less smooth transition from sea water into fresh water. Flora and fauna suffered from this noticeable change. In addition, rivers experienced an increase in sedimentation by polluted sludge, since there was no longer an open passage to the sea.\nProject costs.\nThe projects of the Delta Plan are financed with the Delta Fund. In 1958, when the Delta law was accepted under the Delta Works Commission, the total costs were estimated at 3.3 billion guilder. This was at that time equal to 20% of national GDP. This amount was spread out over the 25 years that it would take to complete the massive engineering project. The Delta works were mostly financed by the national budget, with a contribution of the Marshall Plan of 400 million guilder. In addition, the Dutch natural gas discovery contributed massively to the finance of the project. At completion in 1997, costs were set on 8.2 billion guilder. Nevertheless, in 2012 the total costs were already set on around $13 billion.\nCurrent status.\nThe original plan was completed by the Europoortkering which required the construction of the Maeslantkering in the Nieuwe Waterweg between Maassluis and Hook of Holland and the Hartelkering in the Hartel Canal near Spijkenisse. The works were declared finished after almost forty years in 1997.\nDue to climate change and relative sea-level rise, the dikes will eventually have to be made higher and wider. This is a long term uphill battle against the sea. The needed level of flood protection and the resulting costs are a recurring subject of debate, and involve a complicated decision-making process. In 1995 it was agreed in the Delta Plan Large Rivers and Room for the River projects that about 500 kilometres of insufficient dyke revetments were reinforced and replaced along the Oosterschelde and Westerschelde between 1995 and 2015. After 2015, under the High Water Protection Program, additional upgrades are made.\nIn September 2008, the Delta Commission presided by politician Cees Veerman advised in a report that the Netherlands would need a massive new building program to strengthen the country's water defenses against the anticipated effects of global warming for the next 190 years. The plans included drawing up worst-case scenarios for evacuations and included more than \u20ac100 billion, or $144 billion, in new spending through the year 2100 for measures, such as broadening coastal dunes and strengthening sea and river dikes.\nThe commission said the country must plan for a rise in the North Sea of 1.3 meters by 2100 and 4 meters by 2200.\nProjects.\nThe works that are part of the Delta Works are listed in chronological order with their year of completion:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69400", "revid": "19921271", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69400", "title": "BioWare", "text": "Canadian video game developer\nBioWare is a Canadian video game developer based in Edmonton, Alberta. It was founded in 1995 by newly graduated medical doctors Ray Muzyka, Greg Zeschuk and Augustine Yip. Since 2007, the company has been owned by American publisher Electronic Arts.\nBioWare specializes in role-playing video games, and achieved recognition for developing highly praised and successful licensed franchises: \"Baldur's Gate\", \"Neverwinter Nights\", and '. They proceeded to make several other successful games based on original intellectual property: \"Jade Empire\", the \"Mass Effect\" series, and the \"Dragon Age\" series. In 2011, BioWare launched their first massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), '.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nBioWare was founded by Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, and Augustine Yip. Of the founding team, Muzyka, Zeschuk and Yip had recently graduated from medical school at the University of Alberta, and had a background in programming for use in school. Together with Yip, they had created a medical simulation programme. The three also played video games for recreation, eventually deciding to develop their own. Their success in the medical field provided them with the funding they needed to launch a video game company. To make their first game, they pooled their resources, $100,000 CAD each, which resulted in capital of $300,000. The company was incorporated on 1 February 1995, though formally launched on 22 May 1995.\n1990s: \"Shattered Steel\" and \"Baldur's Gate\".\nTheir first game, \"Shattered Steel\", began its life as a proof-of-concept demo, similar to the \"MechWarrior\" games. This demo was submitted to ten publishers, seven of whom returned to the company with an offer. A publishing deal for \"Shattered Steel\" was eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment. Brent Oster and Trent Oster formed Pyrotek Studios, which continued developing \"Shattered Steel\" but broke up a year later, with Trent joining BioWare as an early employee to finish the game. BioWare's first game was released the following year. \"Shattered Steel\"'s release was described by IGN as a \"modest success\" with \"decent sales\". Two noteworthy points were the deformable terrain (player weapon damage caused craters in the environment) and zone damage (well-aimed gunfire could shoot mounted weapons off enemies). A sequel to \"Shattered Steel\" was planned for 1998 but never realized.\nBioWare's founders and staff were keenly interested in both computerized and pen-and-paper variants of role-playing games. Their next development project, therefore, was determined to be a role-playing game. When Interplay financed \"exploratory development\", BioWare presented the publishers with a demo called \"Battleground: Infinity\". Interplay suggested that the demonstrated gameplay engine would be well-suited to the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" licence which it had acquired from Strategic Simulations. Accordingly, \"Infinity\" was reworked in line with the \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" ruleset.\nThe result was \"Baldur's Gate\", with a development cycle of three years. During this time, the three doctors continued to practice medicine. The demands of development later prompted Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave medicine and move into full-time development. Augustine Yip decided to continue with his medical practice. \"Baldur's Gate\" sold more than two million copies after its release, nearly matching the sales of \"Diablo\". Following the success of \"Baldur's Gate\", the Infinity Engine was used for the games ' and the \"Icewind Dale\" series. The success of \"Baldur's Gate\" was followed by an expansion pack for the game: '.\n2000s: EA Acquisition, \"Mass Effect\" &amp; \"Dragon Age\".\nAt this point, BioWare decided to return to the action genre. The company's initial thought was to develop a sequel to \"Shattered Steel\", but eventually a sequel to \"MDK\" from Shiny Entertainment was chosen for development. \"MDK2\" was released on PC, Dreamcast, and eventually PlayStation 2, offering BioWare their first taste of developing games for consoles. \"MDK2\" drew the same level of praise as its predecessor but, despite the success, BioWare returned to the \"Baldur's Gate\" series for their next project.\n' was released in 2000, two years after the release of \"Baldur's Gate\". \"Baldur's Gate II\" sold two million copies, matching the sales of the first game in the series. However, the success of both \"Baldur's Gate II\" and \"MDK2\" was not enough to stabilize Interplay financially. Subsequently, BioWare began to work with Infogrames, which was later renamed to Atari. \"Neverwinter Nights\" was originally to be published by Interplay, but the company lost the licence of the game to Atari and part of their \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\" licence to BioWare. After selling their D&amp;D licence to Atari, BioWare developed ' and \"Jade Empire\". It had publishing relationships with Interplay Entertainment, Infogrames, under its new name Atari, LucasArts, and Microsoft.\nThe next few years saw a number of changes in BioWare's corporate status. In November 2005, it was announced that BioWare and Pandemic Studios (itself founded by former Activision employees) would be joining forces (with each maintaining their own branding), with private equity fund Elevation Partners investing in the newly named VG Holding Corp. partnership. On 11 October 2007, it was announced that VG Holding Corp. had been bought by Electronic Arts for US$million (equivalent to $ billion in 2024). BioWare therefore became a unit of EA, but still retained its own branding.\nIn 2007, BioWare released the science fiction role-playing game \"Mass Effect\". The following year, BioWare released \"\" on the Nintendo DS, its first title for a handheld game console. Later, EA announced that BioWare would merge with Mythic Entertainment, another division of EA who would rename itself as BioWare Mythic after the deal.\nThe growth of the MMORPG group as part of Electronic Arts in 2008 resulted in three additional studios being added to the BioWare group outside BioWare's original home base in Edmonton. The first, located in Austin, Texas, and headed by industry veterans Gordon Walton and Richard Vogel, was created to work on the \"Star Wars: The Old Republic\" MMORPG project. Both the studio and the project were announced on 13 March 2006. On 2 March 2009, BioWare announced it had opened a new studio in Montreal, Quebec, to assist with existing projects as necessary.\nDuring the mid-2000s, BioWare staff developed a number of video game projects which were ultimately canceled. A handheld spin-off for \"Mass Effect\" franchise titled \"Mass Effect: Corsair\", inspired by the gameplay of \"Star Control\" and played from a first-person perspective, was briefly explored as a potential project for the Nintendo DS in 2008. A sequel to \"Jade Empire\" was under development at one point. The project transitioned into a spiritual successor codenamed \"Revolver\", which was canceled by 2008. Trent Oster led a team which worked on a spy-themed role-playing game codenamed \"Agent\" prior to his second departure from BioWare in 2009. Unused concept art for \"Agent\" and \"Revolver\" are featured in the art book \"BioWare: Stories and Secrets from 25 Years of Game Development\", published in January 2021.\nOn 24 June 2009, Electronic Arts announced a restructuring of their role-playing and massively multiplayer online games development into a new group that included both Mythic Entertainment and BioWare. Ray Muzyka, co-founder and general manager of BioWare, was appointed the group general manager of this newly formed \"BioWare Group\". BioWare's other co-founder, Greg Zeschuk, became the Group Creative Officer for the new MMORPG studio group. BioWare's studios remained unchanged and continued to report to Muzyka. Near the end of 2009, BioWare released the critically acclaimed fantasy role-playing game \"\".\n2010s: Muzyka and Zeschuk's departure, \"Mass Effect\" on hiatus, \"Anthem\".\nIn January 2010, BioWare released the sequel to Mass Effect, \"Mass Effect 2\", which would go on to receive critical acclaim and many awards. The company announced that it would be opening up a new customer service office in Galway, Ireland, in 2011. BioWare completed three major games between 2011 and 2012. The massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) \"\" is based on BioWare's previous contribution to the Star Wars franchise, and was announced on 21 October 2008, although BioWare had first mentioned an unspecified new collaboration with LucasArts in October the previous year. The other games were \"Dragon Age II\", the sequel to \"Dragon Age: Origins\", and \"Mass Effect 3\".\nFollowing the release of \"Mass Effect 3\" in March 2012, numerous players complained about its endings failing to fulfill the developer's earlier promises regarding the conclusion of the trilogy. In response to the controversy surrounding the game's ending sequence, BioWare announced on 5 April that they would reschedule their post-release content production and release an \"Extended Cut\" DLC that would expand the original endings and address the most common points of critique. The Extended Cut was released as a free download on 26 June 2012. On 18 September 2012, the next day after the official announcement of the , both Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, two of the remaining co-founders of BioWare, simultaneously announced they would be retiring from the gaming industry. After almost a year without a formal head, EA appointed Matthew Bromberg the group general manager of the BioWare label on 9 September 2013. Former CEO and president of Major League Gaming, Bromberg worked as the general manager of BioWare Austin since 2012; after his promotion, Jeff Hickman took over as the general manager in Austin. Aaryn Flynn remained in charge of BioWare Canada (Edmonton and Montreal) and Jon Van Caneghem, the head of Victory Games and Waystone Studio (also parts of the BioWare label).\nAfter acquiring and dismantling LucasArts, The Walt Disney Company announced in May 2013 that Electronic Arts will produce future \"Star Wars\" games, \"in addition to the BioWare team, which is already developing for the Star Wars franchise.\" In November 2013, teaser images from the next instalment of the \"Mass Effect\" series were released. At E3 2014, BioWare Edmonton announced working on a new (unnamed) original intellectual property in addition to continuing their established series. Another new IP, titled \"Shadow Realms\" is an episodic 4 vs. 1 story-driven online action role-playing game, and was announced on Gamescom 2014. On 9 February 2015, BioWare Austin announced that development on \"Shadow Realms\" would not continue.\nCasey Hudson, the creator of the \"Mass Effect\" series, left BioWare in May 2014, while Drew Karpyshyn, writer of ' and the first two \"Mass Effect\" games, returned in 2015. \"Dragon Age\"'s writer David Gaider left BioWare in January 2016. Chris Wynn and Chris Schlerf, both of whom had an important role in the development of ', left in December 2015 and February 2016 respectively. Alexis Kennedy, co-founder of Failbetter Games and the creative director of \"Dragon Age: The Last Court\", joined BioWare as its \"first ever guest writer\" in September 2016.\nOn 13 September 2016, EA announced the formation of EA Worldwide Studios, which would consist of BioWare Studios, EA Mobile, and Maxis, and led by DICE co-founder Patrick Soderlund. At the same time, Samantha Ryan, head of EA Mobile and Maxis, was appointed the new head of BioWare Studios. Released in March 2017, \"Andromeda\" was at the center of controversy of equal proportions, if not higher than that around the third chapter; starting with heavy criticisms that were addressed before the video game was released to the lukewarm response received by the specialized press and the fandom with sales lower than the previous \"Mass Effect\" games. Given the circumstances Electronic Arts had reportedly frozen the entire \"Mass Effect\" series, downgrading the BioWare Montr\u00e9al branch from a leading development team to a support team, and later merging it into Motive Studios.\nDuring EA's \"EA Play\" pre-E3 press conference on 10 June 2017, BioWare revealed \"Anthem\", a new action role-playing game, with BioWare's story writer, Drew Karpyshyn, who previously worked on \"Mass Effect\" and \"Mass Effect 2\", contributing to the new game. In July 2017, Aaryn Flynn, general manager of BioWare, announced that he would depart from the company. Hudson returned to BioWare as its new general manager. Lead story developer for \"Jade Empire\" and \"Dragon Age\" creative director Mike Laidlaw announced his departure from BioWare in October 2017 after 14 years with the company. James Ohlen, the lead designer of the \"Baldur's Gate\" series, \"Neverwinter Nights\", \"Knights of the Old Republic\", \"Jade Empire\", and \"Dragon Age: Origins\", as well as the game director of \"The Old Republic\" MMO, left the studio after 22 years in July 2018.\nOn 24 September 2019, it was announced that BioWare had moved from their old location on Calgary Trail into 3 stories of the Epcor Tower in downtown Edmonton.\n2020s: New \"Dragon Age\" and \"Mass Effect\" games.\nOn 7 November 2020 or \"N7 Day\", a date first declared in 2012 by BioWare as an annual \"worldwide celebration\" of the \"Mass Effect franchise\", \"\" was announced as well as an all-new entry to the franchise that had just started development. The following month, on 3 December, both Hudson and Mark Darrah, the executive producer on the \"Dragon Age\" series, announced their departures from the studio. Electronic Arts stated that work on the \"Mass Effect\" and \"Dragon Age\" games would still continue at the studio. A week later, a teaser trailer for the next \"Mass Effect\" game was shown at The Game Awards.\nOn 14 May 2021, \" was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and the Xbox One series.\nOn 23 August 2023, about 50 BioWare developers were laid off. A group of former employees later sued EA, seeking better severance following their layoffs.\nOn 31 October 2024, the fourth instalment in the Dragon Age series, \", was released. The game received \"generally favorable\" reviews from critics according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. \"Eurogamer\" described the sales as \"decent\" but said the numbers may not have pleased publisher EA. \"Dragon Age: The Veilguard\" was review bombed by users for being \"'woke,' 'DEI,' 'propaganda,' and 'agenda-driven'\" on \"Metacritic\", causing the platform to respond with a statement and by removing user reviews which had violated their guidelines. \"Veilguard\" is the first BioWare game that allows the player character to identify as transgender. On 7 November 2024, or \"N7 Day\", BioWare released a patch which added several \"Mass Effect\"-inspired costumes into the game. In late October 2024, following the release of \"Veilguard\", creative director John Epler stated that BioWare's attention had \"shifted entirely to the next \"Mass Effect\" [game]\" in an interview with Rolling Stone. \"Veilguard\" game director Corinne Busche exited BioWare for a role at a different company in January 2025.\nAmazon MGM Studios officially confirmed on 7 November 2024 that a \"Mass Effect\" TV series is in development, following negotiations that had started in late 2021. BioWare executive producer Michael Gamble will also act as an executive producer on the TV adaptation.\nIn January 2025, EA lowered its upcoming annual revenue forecast due to the underperformance of both \"EA Sports FC 25\" and \"Veilguard\". EA stated that \"Veilguard\" had \"engaged\" 1.5 million players during the three months ending December 31, 2024, underperforming their expectations by half. Later that month, EA restructured and downsized BioWare. While a small \"Mass Effect\" team was retained to continue work, the studio \"is now down from more than 200 people two years ago to less than 100 today\". This restructuring included layoffs in the \"Dragon Age\" team,\"\" with IGN noting that \"terminated\" employees \"are being offered time to apply to other roles within the company if they so choose\". Bloomberg stated that some BioWare employees were \"loaned out to other teams within their parent company\" and then later informed \"that the loans had morphed into permanent relocations\" to various EA subsidiaries. \"PC Gamer\" highlighted that \"well-known BioWare veterans\" are no longer at the company and \"collectively, the cuts represent a major loss of creative talent for the studio, and bears echoes of BioWare's layoff of roughly 50 employees in 2023\".\nTechnology.\nBetween 1998 and 2011, BioWare developed a number of in-house video game engines to serve as technical basis for their games. Some of these engines were then licensed to other companies to develop their own games. Others came with modding toolkits, allowing the fan community to implement original adventures using the technology of BioWare's games.\nBioWare created the Infinity Engine to use it as a core component for development of the \"Baldur's Gate\" series (1998\u20132001), which were 2D role-playing video games based on \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\". The engine was also used by Black Isle Studios to create the critically acclaimed \"\" (1999) and the \"Icewind Dale\" series (2000\u20132002). When Beamdog sought out a license from BioWare and started engineering enhanced versions of these games in 2012, they created an updated version of the Infinity Engine, referred to as the \"Infinity Enhanced Engine\" (alternatively Infinity Plus Engine or Infinity Bless Engine).\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Aurora Engine was the successor to the Infinity Engine, featuring full 3D environments, real-time lighting and shadows, and surround sound. BioWare used the Aurora Engine to produce their 2002 \"Neverwinter Nights\", as well as two expansion packs. The game included the Aurora toolset, a collection of tools allowing users to create their own digital adventure modules to be played either in single-player or in online multiplayer. The toolset enjoyed great popularity among the modding community, with over a thousand fan-made modules produced in it within half a year after the release. Obsidian Entertainment (successor to Black Isle Studios) used an updated version of BioWare's Aurora, titled \"Electron Engine\", to produce \"Neverwinter Nights 2\" (2006) and its three expansion packs (2007\u20132009). Like the original, the Electron toolset was released with the game. The Polish studio CD Projekt Red used the Aurora Engine to develop \"The Witcher\", the 2007 video game adaptation of the Polish fantasy novel series, although the rendering module was rewritten from scratch.\nBioWare used an updated version of the Aurora, titled the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Odyssey Engine, to produce ' in 2003 and their first original intellectual property role-playing game \"Jade Empire\" in 2005. The Odyssey Engine was the first BioWare engine to allow developing for video game consoles, with both \"Knights of the Old Republic\" and \"Jade Empire\" originally released for the Xbox before being ported to the PC platform. Obsidian Entertainment used the Odyssey Engine to develop ' (2004), a sequel to the original \"Knights of the Old Republic\". BioWare maintained limited oversight on Obsidian's development of \"The Sith Lords\", as well as \"Neverwinter Nights 2\".\nThe &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Eclipse Engine succeeded the Odyssey Engine and, among other things, supported PhysX hardware acceleration. It was used to produce ' (2009) and its expansion pack ' (2010). Like \"Neverwinter Nights\", \"Origins\" was released with a toolset to allow the players to run their own adventure modules on the Eclipse Engine. An upgraded version of the Eclipse Engine, internally known as the Lycium Engine, was used to produce \"Dragon Age II\" (2011).\nIn September 2004, BioWare acquired a license to use Unreal Engine 3 from developer Epic Games. Unreal Engine 3 would ultimately be used to develop the original \"Mass Effect\" trilogy (2007\u20132012), as well as the remastered \"\" in 2021.\nIn 2013, EA confirmed that all future games developed by BioWare will be made on DICE's Frostbite engine.

{"id": "69402", "revid": "34452882", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69402", "title": "Guido of Arezzo", "text": "Italian music theorist and pedagogue (c. 991/2\u20131033)\nGuido of Arezzo (; c.\u2009991\u2013992 \u2013 after 1033) was an Italian music theorist and pedagogue of High medieval music. A Benedictine monk, he is regarded as the inventor\u2014or by some, developer\u2014of the modern staff notation that had a massive influence on the development of Western musical notation and practice. Perhaps the most significant European writer on music between Boethius and Johannes Tinctoris, after the former's \"De institutione musica\", Guido's \"Micrologus\" was the most widely distributed medieval treatise on music.\nBiographical information on Guido is only available from two contemporary documents; though they give limited background, a basic understanding of his life can be unravelled. By around 1013 he began teaching at Pomposa Abbey, but his antiphonary \"Prologus in antiphonarium\" and novel teaching methods based on staff notation brought considerable resentment from his colleagues. He thus moved to Arezzo in 1025 and under the patronage of Bishop Tedald of Arezzo he taught singers at the Arezzo Cathedral. Using staff notation, he was able to teach large amounts of music quickly and he wrote the multifaceted \"Micrologus\", attracting attention from around Italy. Interested in his innovations, Pope John XIX called him to Rome. After arriving and beginning to explain his methods to the clergy, sickness sent him away in the summer. The rest of his life is largely unknown, but he settled in a monastery near Arezzo, probably one of the Avellana of the Camaldolese order.\nContext and sources.\nInformation on Guido's life is scarce; the music historian Charles Burney asserted that the paucity of records was because Guido was a monk. Burney furthered that, in the words of musicologist Samuel D. Miller, \"Guido's modesty, selfless abandon from material gain life, and obedience to authority tended to obscure his moves, work, and motivations\". The scholarly outline of Guido's life has been subject to much mythologization and misunderstandings. These dubious claims include that he spent much of life in France (recorded as early as Johannes Trithemius's 1494 \"De scriptoribus ecclesiasticis\"); that he trained in the Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s near Paris; and unsupported rumours that he was imprisoned because of plots from those hostile to his innovations.\nThe primary surviving documents associated with Guido are two undated letters; a dedicatory letter to Bishop Tedald of Arezzo and a letter to his colleague Michael of Pomposa, known as the \"Epistola ad Michaelem\". These letters provide enough information and context to map the main events and chronology of Guido's life, though Miller notes that they do \"not permit a detailed, authoritative sketch\".\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nGuido was born sometime between 990 and 999. This birthdate range was conjectured from a now lost and undated manuscript of the \"Micrologus\", where he stated that he was age 34 while John XIX was pope (1024\u20131033). Swiss musicologist Hans Oesch's dating of the manuscript to 1025\u20131026 is agreed by scholars Claude V. Palisca, Dolores Pesce and Angelo Mafucci, with Mafucci noting that it is \"now unanimously accepted\". This would suggest a birthdate of c.\u2009991\u2013992.\nGuido's birthplace is even less certain, and has been the subject of much disagreement between scholars, with music historian Cesarino Ruini noting that due to Guido's pivotal significance \"It is understandable that several locations in Italy claim the honor of having given birth to G[uido]\". There are two principal candidates: Arezzo, Tuscany or the Pomposa Abbey on the Adriatic coast near Ferrara. Musicologist Jos. Smits van Waesberghe asserted that he was born in Pomposa due to his strong connection with the Abbey from c.\u20091013\u20131025; according to Van Waesberghe, Guido's epitaph 'of Arezzo' is because of his stay of about a dozen years there later in life. Disagreeing with Van Waesberghe's conclusions, Mafucci argued that were Guido born in Pomposa, he would have spent nearly 35 years there and would thus more likely be known as 'of Pomposa'. Mafucci cites the account of the near-contemporary historian Sigebert of Gembloux (c.\u20091030\u20131112) who referred to Guido as \"Guido Aretinus\" (Guido of Arezzo), suggesting that the early use of such a designation means Guido's birthplace was Arezzo. Citing recently unearthed documents in 2003, Mafucci identified Guido with a \"Guido clerico filius Roze\" of the Arezzo Cathedral. If Mafucci is correct, Guido would have received early musical education at the Arezzo Cathedral from a deacon named Sigizo and was ordained as a subdeacon and active as a cantor.\nPomposa.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Guido [...] perhaps attracted by the fame of what was considered one of the most famous Benedictine abbeys, full of hope of new spiritual and musical life, he enters the monastery of Pomposa, unaware of the storm that, in a few years, it would hit him. In fact [...] it will be his own brothers and the abbot himself who will force him to leave Pomposa.\"\nAngelo Mafucci, trans. from Italian\nAround 1013 Guido went to the Pomposa Abbey, one of the most famous Benedictine monasteries of the time, to complete his education. Becoming a noted monk, he started to develop the novel principles of staff notation (music being written and read from an organized visual system).\nLikely drawing from the writings of Odo of Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s, Guido began to draft his system in the antiphonary \"Regulae rhythmicae\", which he probably worked on with his colleague Michael of Pomposa. In the prologue to the antiphonary, Guido expressed his frustration with the large amount of time singers spent to memorize music. The system, he explained, would prevent the need for memorization and thus permit the singers extra time to diversify their studies into other prayers and religious texts. He began to instruct his singers along these lines and obtained a reputation for being able to teach substantial amounts of music quickly. Though his ideas brought interest from around Italy, they inspired considerable jealousy and resistance from his fellow monks, who felt threatened by his innovations. Among those disapproving was the Abbot Guido of Pomposa. In light of these objections, Guido left Pomposa in around 1025 and moved to\u2014or 'returned to', if following the Arezzo birthplace hypothesis\u2014Arezzo.\nArezzo, Rome and later life.\nArezzo was without a monastery; Bishop Tedald of Arezzo (Bishop from 1023 to 1036) appointed Guido to oversee the training of singers for the Arezzo Cathedral. It was at this time that Guido began work on the \"Micrologus\", or in full \"Micrologus de disciplina artis musicae\". The work was both commissioned by and dedicated to Tedald. It was primarily a musical manual for singers and discussed a wide variety of topics, including chant, polyphonic music, the monochord, melody, syllables, modes, organum, neumes and many of his teaching methods. Resuming the same teaching approach as before, Guido lessened the standard 10-year training for the ideal cantor to only one or two years. Italy-wide attention returned to Guido, and Pope John XIX called him to Rome, having either seen or heard of both his \"Regulae rhythmicae\" and innovative staff notation teaching techniques. Theobald may have helped arrange the visit, and in around 1028, Guido traveled there with the Canon Dom Peter of Arezzo as well as the Abbot Grimaldus of Arezzo. His presentation incited much interest from the clergy and the details of his visit are included in the \"Epistola ad Michaelem\".\nWhile in Rome, Guido became sick and the hot summer forced him to leave, with the assurance that he would visit again and give further explanation of his theories. In the \"Epistola ad Michaelem\", Guido mentions that before leaving, he was approached by the Abbot Guido of Pomposa who regretted his part in Guido's leave from Arezzo and thus invited him to return to the Abbey. Guido of Pomposa's rationale was that he should avoid the cities, as most of their churchmen were accused of simony, though it remains unknown if Guido chose the Pomposa Abbey as his destination. It seems more likely that around 1029, Guido settled in a monastery of the Avellana of the Camaldolese order near Arezzo, as many of the oldest manuscripts with Guidonian notation are Camaldolese. The last document pertaining to Guido places him in Arezzo on 20 May 1033; his death is only known to have been sometime after that date.\nMusic theory and innovations.\nWorks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks by Guido of Arezzo\nFour works are securely attributed to Guido: the \"Micrologus\", the \"Prologus in antiphonarium\", the \"Regulae rhythmicae\" and the \"Epistola ad Michaelem\".\nThe \"Epistola ad Michaelem\" is the only one not a formal musical treatise; it was written directly after Guido's trip to Rome, perhaps in 1028, but no later than 1033. All three musical treatises were written before the \"Epistola ad Michaelem\", as Guido mentions each of them in it. More specifically, the \"Micrologus\" can be dated to after 1026, as in the preliminary dedicatory letter to Tebald, Guido congratulates him for his 1026 plans for the new St Donatus church. Though the \"Prologus in antiphonarium\" was begun in Pomposa (1013\u20131025), it seems to have not been completed until 1030.\nSolmization.\nGuido developed new techniques for teaching, such as staff notation and the use of the \"ut\u2013re\u2013mi\u2013fa\u2013sol\u2013la\" (do\u2013re\u2013mi\u2013fa\u2013so\u2013la) mnemonic (solmization). The syllables ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la (do-re-mi-fa-sol-la) are taken from the six half-lines of the first stanza of the hymn \"Ut queant laxis\", the notes of which are successively raised by one step, and the text of which is attributed to the Italian monk and scholar Paulus Deacon (although the musical line\u00a0either shares a common ancestor with the earlier setting of Horace's Ode to Phyllis (Odes 4.11) recorded in Montpellier manuscript H425, or may have been taken from there). Giovanni Battista Doni is known for having changed the name of note \"Ut\" (C), renaming it \"Do\" (in the \"Do Re Mi ...\" sequence known as solf\u00e8ge). A seventh note, \"Si\" (from the initials for \"Sancte Iohannes,\" Latin for Saint John the Baptist) was added shortly after to complete the diatonic scale. In anglophone countries, \"Si\" was changed to \"Ti\" by Sarah Glover in the nineteenth century so that every syllable might begin with a different letter (this also freed up Si for later use as Sol-sharp). \"Ti\" is used in tonic sol-fa and in the song \"Do-Re-Mi\".\nThe Guidonian hand.\nGuido is somewhat erroneously credited with the invention of the Guidonian hand, a widely used mnemonic system where note names are mapped to parts of the human hand. Only a rudimentary form of the Guidonian hand is actually described by Guido, and the fully elaborated system of natural, hard, and soft hexachords cannot be securely attributed to him.\nIn the 12th century, a development in teaching and learning music in a more efficient manner arose. Guido of Arezzo's alleged development of the Guidonian hand, more than a hundred years after his death, allowed musicians to label a specific joint or fingertip with the gamut (also referred to as the hexachord in the modern era). Using specific joints of the hand and fingertips transformed the way one would learn and memorize solmization syllables. Not only did the Guidonian hand become a standard use in preparing music in the 12th century, its popularity grew more widespread well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The knowledge and use of the Guidonian hand would allow a musician to simply transpose, identify intervals, and aid in the use of notation and the creation of new music. Musicians were able to sing and memorize longer sections of music and counterpoint during performances and the amount of time spent diminished dramatically.\nLegacy.\nAlmost immediately after his death commentaries were written on Guido's work, particularly the \"Micrologus\". One of the most noted is the \"De musica\" of Johannes Cotto (), whose influential treatise was largely a commentary that expanded and revised the \"Micrologus\". Aribo () also dedicated a substantial part of his \"De musica\" as a commentary on chapter 15 of the \"Micrologus\". Other significant commentaries are anonymous, including the \"Liber argumentorum\" and \"Liber specierum\" (both Italian, 1050\u20131100); the \"Commentarius anonymus in Micrologum\" (Belgian or Bavarian, c.\u20091070\u20131100); and the \"Metrologus\" (English, 13th century).\nGuido of Arezzo and his work are frequent namesakes. The controversial mass \"Missa Scala Aretina\" (1702) by Francisco Valls takes its name from Guido's hexachord. Lorenzo Nencini sculpted a statue of Guido in 1847 that is included in the Loggiato of the Uffizi, Florence. A statue to him was erected 1882 in his native Arezzo; it was sculpted by Salvino Salvini. Modern namesakes include the computer music notation system GUIDO music notation, as well as the \"Concorso Polif\u00f3nico Guido d'Arezzo\" (International Guido d'Arezzo Polyphonic Contest) hosted by the Fondazione Guido D'Arezzo in Arezzo. A street in Milan, Via Guido D'Arezzo, is named after him.\nIn 1950, the \"Comitato Nazionale per le Onoranze a Guido Monaco\" (National Committee for Honors to Guido Monaco) held various events for the ninth centenary of Guido's death. Among these was a monograph competition; Jos Smits van Waesberghe won with the Latin work \"De musico-paedagogico et theoretico Guidone Aretino eiusque vita et moribus\" (\"The Musical-Pedagogy of Theoretician Guido of Arezzo Both His Life and Morals\").\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n\"See for an extensive bibliography\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Disaffected crewmen, led by acting-Lieutenant Fletcher Christian, seized control of from the captain, Lieutenant William Bligh, and set him and eighteen loyalists adrift in the ship's open launch. The reasons behind the mutiny are still debated. Bligh and his crew stopped for supplies on Tofua, where a crew member was killed. Bligh navigated more than in the launch to reach safety and began the process of bringing the mutineers to justice. The mutineers variously settled on Tahiti or on Pitcairn Island. \n\"Bounty\" had left England in 1787 on a mission to collect and transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti to the West Indies. A five-month layover in Tahiti, during which many of the men lived ashore and formed relationships with native Polynesians, led those men to be less amenable to naval discipline. Relations between Bligh and his crew deteriorated after he reportedly began handing out increasingly harsh punishments, criticism, and abuse, with Christian being a particular target. After three weeks back at sea, Christian and others forced Bligh from the ship. Twenty-five men remained on board afterwards, including loyalists held against their will, and others for whom there was no room in the launch.\nAfter Bligh reached England in April 1790, the Admiralty despatched HMS \"Pandora\" to apprehend the mutineers. Fourteen were captured in Tahiti and imprisoned on board \"Pandora\", which then searched without success for Christian's party that had hidden on Pitcairn Island. After turning back towards England, \"Pandora\" ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef, with the loss of 31 crew and four \"Bounty\" prisoners. The ten surviving detainees reached England in June 1792 and were court-martialled; four were acquitted, three were pardoned, and three were hanged.\nChristian's group remained undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808, by which time only one mutineer, John Adams, remained alive. His fellow mutineers, including Christian, were dead, killed either by one another or by their Polynesian companions. No action was taken against Adams. Descendants of the mutineers and their accompanying Tahitians have lived on Pitcairn into the 21st century.\nBackground.\n\"Bounty\" and its mission.\nHis Majesty's Armed Vessel (HMAV) \"Bounty\", or HMS \"Bounty\", was built in 1784 at the Blaydes shipyard in Hull, Yorkshire, as a collier named \"Bethia\". It was renamed after being purchased by the Royal Navy for \u00a31,950 in May 1787 (). It was three-masted, long overall and across at its widest point, and registered at 230 tons burthen. Its armament was four short four-pounder carriage guns and ten half-pounder swivel guns, supplemented by small arms such as muskets. As it was rated by the Admiralty as a cutter, the smallest category of warship, its commander would be a lieutenant rather than a post-captain and would be the only commissioned officer on board. Nor did a cutter warrant the usual detachment of Royal Marines that naval commanders could use to enforce their authority.\n\"Bounty\" had been acquired to transport breadfruit plants from Tahiti, then rendered \"Otaheite\", a Polynesian island in the South Pacific Ocean, to the British colonies in the West Indies. The expedition was promoted by the Royal Society and organised by its president Sir Joseph Banks, who shared the view of Caribbean plantation owners that breadfruit might grow well there and provide cheap food for the slaves. \"Bounty\" was refitted under Banks' supervision at Deptford Dockyard on the River Thames. The great cabin, normally the quarters of the ship's captain, was converted into a greenhouse for over a thousand potted breadfruit plants, with glazed windows, skylights, and a lead-covered deck and drainage system to prevent the waste of fresh water. The space required for these arrangements in the small ship meant that the crew and officers would endure severe overcrowding for the duration of the long voyage.\nBligh.\nWith Banks' agreement, command of the expedition was given to Lieutenant William Bligh, whose experiences included Captain James Cook's third and final voyage (1776\u201380) in which he had served as sailing master, or chief navigator, on HMS \"Resolution\". Bligh was born in Plymouth in 1754 into a family of naval and military tradition. Appointment to Cook's ship at the age of 21 had been a considerable honour, although Bligh believed that his contribution was not properly acknowledged in the expedition's official account. With the 1783 ending of the eight-year American War of Independence\u2014in which the French Navy fought from 1778\u2014the vast Royal Navy was reduced in size, and Bligh found himself ashore on half-pay.\nAfter a period of idleness, Bligh took temporary employment in the mercantile service and in 1785 was captain of the \"Britannia\", a vessel owned by his wife's uncle, Duncan Campbell. Bligh assumed the prestigious \"Bounty\" appointment on 16 August 1787, at a considerable financial cost. His lieutenant's pay of four shillings a day (\u00a370 a year) contrasted with the \u00a3500 a year he had earned as captain of \"Britannia\". Because of the limited number of warrant officers allowed on \"Bounty\", Bligh was also required to act as the ship's purser. To survey an important but under-explored passage, Bligh's sailing orders stated that he was to enter the Pacific via Cape Horn around South America and then, after collecting the breadfruit plants, sail westward through the Endeavour Strait. He was then to cross the Indian and South Atlantic Oceans to the West Indies islands in the Caribbean. \"Bounty\" would thus complete a circumnavigation of the Earth in the Southern Hemisphere.\nCrew.\n\"Bounty\"'s complement was 46 men, comprising 44 Royal Navy personnel (including Bligh) and two civilian botanists. Directly beneath Bligh were his warrant officers, appointed by the Navy Board and headed by the sailing master John Fryer. The other warrant officers were the boatswain, the surgeon, the carpenter and the gunner. To the two master's mates and two midshipmen were added several honorary midshipmen\u2014so-called \"young gentlemen\" who were aspirant naval officers. These signed the ship's roster as able seamen but were quartered with the midshipmen and treated on equal terms with them.\nMost of \"Bounty\"'s crew were chosen by Bligh or were recommended to him by influential patrons. The gunner, William Peckover, and the armourer, Joseph Coleman, had been with Cook and Bligh on \"Resolution\"; several others had sailed under Bligh more recently on \"Britannia\". Among these was the 23-year-old Fletcher Christian, who came from a wealthy Cumberland family descended from Manx gentry. Christian had chosen a life at sea rather than the legal career envisaged by his family. He had twice voyaged with Bligh to the West Indies, and the two had formed a master-pupil relationship through which Christian had become a skilled navigator. Christian was willing to serve on \"Bounty\" without pay as one of the \"young gentlemen\"; Bligh gave him one of the salaried master's mate's berths. Another of the young gentlemen recommended to Bligh was 15-year-old Peter Heywood, also from a Manx family and a distant relation of Christian's. Heywood had left school at age 14 to spend a year on , a harbour-bound training vessel at Plymouth. His recommendation to Bligh came from Richard Betham, a Heywood family friend who was Bligh's father-in-law.\nThe two botanists, or \"gardeners\", were chosen by Banks. The chief botanist, David Nelson, was a veteran of Cook's third expedition who had been to Tahiti and had learned some of the natives' language. Nelson's assistant William Brown was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French. Banks also helped to secure the official midshipmen's berths for two of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, Thomas Hayward and John Hallett. Overall, \"Bounty\"'s crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30; at the time of departure, Bligh was 33 years old. Among the older crewmembers were the 39-year-old Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, a year older and formerly sailmaker on \"Britannia\". The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, both aged 15 when they left England.\nLiving space on the ship was allocated on the basis of rank. Bligh, having yielded the great cabin, occupied private sleeping quarters with an adjacent dining area or pantry on the starboard side of the ship, and Fryer a small cabin on the opposite side. The surgeon Thomas Huggan, the other warrant officers, and Nelson the botanist had tiny cabins on the lower deck, while the master's mates and the midshipmen, together with the young gentlemen, berthed together in an area behind the captain's dining room known as the cockpit; as junior or prospective officers, they were allowed use of the quarterdeck. The other ranks had their quarters in the forecastle, a windowless unventilated area measuring with headroom of .\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-float/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExpedition.\nTo Cape Horn.\nOn 15 October 1787, \"Bounty\" left Deptford for Spithead, in the English Channel, to await final sailing orders. Adverse weather delayed arrival at Spithead until 4 November. Bligh was anxious to depart quickly and reach Cape Horn before the end of the short southern summer, but the Admiralty did not accord him high priority and delayed issuing the orders for a further three weeks. When \"Bounty\" finally sailed on 28 November, the ship was trapped by contrary winds and unable to clear Spithead until 23 December. With the prospect of a passage around Cape Horn now in serious doubt, Bligh received permission from the Admiralty to take, if necessary, an alternative route to Tahiti via the Cape of Good Hope.\nAs the ship settled into its sea-going routine, Bligh introduced Cook's strict discipline regarding sanitation and diet. According to the expedition's historian Sam McKinney, Bligh enforced these rules \"with a fanatical zeal, continually fuss[ing] and fum[ing] over the cleanliness of his ship and the food served to the crew.\" He replaced the navy's traditional watch system of alternating four-hour spells on and off duty with a three-watch system, whereby each four-hour duty was followed by eight hours' rest. For the crew's exercise and entertainment, he introduced regular music and dancing sessions. Bligh's despatches to Campbell and Banks indicated his satisfaction; he had no occasion to administer punishment because, he wrote: \"Both men and officers tractable and well disposed, &amp; cheerfulness &amp; content in the countenance of every one\". The only adverse feature of the voyage to date, according to Bligh, was the conduct of the surgeon Huggan, who was revealed as an indolent, unhygienic drunkard.\nFrom the start of the voyage, Bligh had established warm relations with Christian, according him a status which implied that he was Bligh's second-in-command rather than Fryer. On 2 March, Bligh formalised the position by assigning Christian to the rank of acting-Lieutenant. Fryer showed little outward sign of resentment at his junior's advancement, but his relations with Bligh significantly worsened from this point. A week after the promotion, and on Fryer's insistence, Bligh ordered the flogging of seaman Matthew Quintal, who received twelve lashes for \"insolence and mutinous behaviour\", thereby dashing Bligh's expressed hope of a voyage free from such punishment.\nOn 2 April, as \"Bounty\" approached Cape Horn, a strong gale and high seas began an unbroken period of stormy weather which, Bligh wrote, \"exceeded what I had ever met with before\u00a0... with severe squalls of hail and sleet\". The winds drove the ship back; on 3 April, it was further north than it had been a week earlier. Again and again, Bligh forced the ship forward, to be repeatedly repelled. On 17 April, he informed his exhausted crew that the sea had beaten them, and that they would turn and head for the Cape of Good Hope\u2014\"to the great joy of every person on Board\", Bligh recorded.\nCape to Pacific.\nOn 24 May 1788, \"Bounty\" anchored in False Bay, east of the Cape of Good Hope, where five weeks were spent in repairs and reprovisioning. Bligh's log emphasised how fit and well he and his crew were, by comparison with other vessels, and expressed hope that he would receive credit for this. At one stage during the sojourn, Bligh lent money to Christian, a gesture that the historian Greg Dening suggests might have sullied their relationship by becoming a source of anxiety and even resentment to the younger man. In her account of the voyage, Caroline Alexander describes the loan as \"a significant act of friendship\", but one which Bligh ensured Christian did not forget.\nAfter leaving False Bay on 1 July, \"Bounty\" set out across the southern Indian Ocean on the long voyage to their next port of call, Adventure Bay in Van Diemen's Land (now called Tasmania). They passed the remote \u00cele Saint-Paul, a small uninhabited island which Bligh knew from earlier navigators contained fresh water and a hot spring, but he did not attempt a landing. The weather was cold and wintry, conditions akin to the vicinity of Cape Horn, and it was difficult to take navigational observations, but Bligh's skill was such that on 19 August he sighted Mewstone Rock, on the south-west corner of Van Diemen's Land and, two days later, made anchorage in Adventure Bay.\nThe \"Bounty\" party spent their time at Adventure Bay in recuperation, fishing, replenishment of water casks, and felling timber. There were peaceful encounters with the native population. The first sign of overt discord between Bligh and his officers occurred when the captain exchanged angry words with the carpenter, William Purcell, over the latter's methods for cutting wood. Bligh ordered Purcell back to the ship and, when the carpenter stood his ground, Bligh withheld his rations, which \"immediately brought him to his senses\", according to Bligh.\nFurther clashes occurred on the final leg of the journey to Tahiti. On 9 October, Fryer refused to sign the ship's account books unless Bligh provided him with a certificate attesting to his complete competence throughout the voyage. Bligh would not be coerced. He summoned the crew and read the Articles of War, at which Fryer backed down. There was also trouble with the surgeon Huggan, whose careless blood-letting of able seaman James Valentine while treating him for asthma led to the seaman's death from a blood infection. To cover his error, Huggan reported to Bligh that Valentine had died from scurvy, which led Bligh to apply his own medicinal and dietary antiscorbutic remedies to the entire ship's company. By now, Huggan was almost incapacitated with drink, until Bligh confiscated his supply. Huggan briefly returned to duty; before \"Bounty\"'s arrival in Tahiti, he examined all on board for signs of venereal disease and found none. \"Bounty\" came to anchor in Matavai Bay, Tahiti, on 26 October 1788, concluding a journey of .\nTahiti.\nBligh's first action on arrival was to secure the co-operation of the local chieftains, as well as the King of Tahiti, P\u014dmare I. The paramount chief Tynah remembered Bligh from Cook's voyage fifteen years previously and greeted him warmly. Bligh presented the chiefs with gifts and informed them that their own King George wished in return only breadfruit plants. They happily agreed with this simple request. Bligh assigned Christian to lead a shore party charged with establishing a compound in which the plants would be nurtured.\nWhether based ashore or on board, the men's duties during \"Bounty\"'s five-month stay in Tahiti were relatively light. Many led promiscuous lives among the native women\u2014altogether, eighteen officers and men, including Christian, received treatment for venereal infections\u2014while others took regular partners. Christian formed a close relationship with a Polynesian woman named Mauatua, to whom he gave the name \"Isabella\" after a former sweetheart from Cumberland. Bligh remained chaste himself, but was tolerant of his men's activities, unsurprised that they should succumb to temptation when \"the allurements of dissipation are beyond any thing that can be conceived\". Nevertheless, he expected them to do their duty efficiently, and was disappointed to find increasing instances of neglect and slackness on the part of his officers. Infuriated, he wrote: \"Such neglectful and worthless petty officers I believe were never in a ship such as are in this.\"\nHuggan died on 10 December. Bligh attributed this to \"the effects of intemperance and indolence\u00a0... he never would be prevailed on to take half a dozen turns upon deck at a time, through the whole course of the voyage\". For all his earlier favoured status, Christian did not escape Bligh's wrath. He was often humiliated by the captain\u2014sometimes in front of the crew and the Tahitians\u2014for real or imagined slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became increasingly common. On 5 January 1789 three members of the crew\u2014Charles Churchill, William Muspratt and John Millward\u2014deserted, taking a small boat, arms and ammunition. Muspratt had recently been flogged for neglect. Among the belongings Churchill left on the ship was a list of names that Bligh interpreted as possible accomplices in a desertion plot\u2014the captain later asserted that the names included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh was persuaded that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was not planning to desert, and the matter was dropped. Churchill, Millward and Muspratt were found after three weeks and, on their return to the ship, were flogged.\nFrom February onwards, the pace of work increased; more than 1,000 breadfruit plants were potted and carried into the ship, where they filled the great cabin. The ship was overhauled for the long homeward voyage, in many cases by men who regretted the forthcoming departure and loss of their easy life with the Tahitians. Bligh was impatient to be away, but as Richard Hough observes in his account, he \"failed to anticipate how his company would react to the severity and austerity of life at sea\u00a0... after five dissolute, hedonistic months at Tahiti\". The work was done by 1 April 1789, and four days later, after an affectionate farewell from Tynah and his queen, \"Bounty\" left the harbour.\nTowards home.\nIn their \"Bounty\" histories, both Hough and Alexander maintain that the men were not at a stage close to mutiny; however, they were sorry to leave Tahiti. The journal of James Morrison, the boatswain's mate, supports this. The events that followed, Hough suggests, were determined in the three weeks following the departure, when Bligh's anger and intolerance reached paranoid proportions. Christian was a particular target, always seeming to bear the brunt of the captain's rages. Unaware of the effects of his behaviour on his officers and crew, Bligh would forget these displays instantly and attempt to resume normal conversation.\nOn 22 April 1789, \"Bounty\" arrived at Nomuka, in the Friendly Islands (now called Tonga), intending to pick up wood, water, and further supplies on the final scheduled stop before the Endeavour Strait. Bligh had visited the island with Cook and knew that the inhabitants could behave unpredictably. He put Christian in charge of the watering party and equipped him with muskets, but at the same time ordered that the arms should be left in the boat instead of carried ashore. Christian's party was harassed and threatened continually but were unable to retaliate, having been denied the use of arms. He returned to the ship with his task incomplete, and was cursed by Bligh as \"a damned cowardly rascal\". Further disorder ashore resulted in the thefts of a small anchor and an adze, for which Bligh further berated Christian and Fryer. In an attempt to recover the missing property, Bligh briefly detained the island's chieftains on the ship, but to no avail. When he finally gave the order to sail, neither the anchor nor the adze had been restored.\nBy 27 April, Christian was in a state of despair, depressed and brooding. His mood was worsened when Bligh accused him of stealing coconuts from the captain's private supply. Bligh punished the whole crew for this theft, stopping their rum ration and reducing their food by half. Feeling that his position was now intolerable, Christian considered constructing a raft with which he could escape to an island and take his chances with the natives. He may have acquired wood for this purpose from Purcell. In any event, his discontent became common knowledge among his fellow officers. Two of the young gentlemen, George Stewart and Edward Young, urged him not to desert; Young assured him that he would have the support of almost all on board if he were to seize the ship and depose Bligh. Stewart told him the crew were \"ripe for anything\".\nMutiny.\nSeizure.\nIn the early hours of 28 April 1789, \"Bounty\" lay about south of the island of Tofua. After a largely sleepless night, Christian had decided to act. He understood from his discussions with Young and Stewart which crewmen were his most likely supporters and, after approaching Quintal and Isaac Martin, he learned the names of several more. With the help of these men, Christian rapidly gained control of the upper deck; those who questioned his actions were ordered to keep quiet. At about 05:15, Christian went below, dismissed Hallett (who was sleeping on the chest containing the ship's muskets) and distributed arms to his followers before making for Bligh's cabin. Three men took hold of the captain and tied his hands, threatening to kill him if he raised the alarm; Bligh \"however called sufficiently loud to alarm the officers\". The commotion woke Fryer, who saw, from his cabin opposite, the mutineers frogmarching Bligh away. The mutineers ordered Fryer to \"lay down again, and hold my tongue or I was a dead man\".\nBligh was brought to the quarterdeck, his hands bound by a cord held by Christian, who was brandishing a bayonet; some reports maintained that Christian had a sounding plummet hanging from his neck so that he could jump overboard and drown himself if the mutiny failed. Others who had been awakened by the noise left their berths and joined in the general pandemonium. It was unclear at this stage who were or were not active mutineers. Hough describes the scene: \"Everyone was, more or less, making a noise, either cursing, jeering or just shouting for the reassurance it gave them to do so\". Bligh shouted continually, demanding to be set free, sometimes addressing individuals by name, and otherwise exhorting the company generally to \"knock Christian down!\" Fryer was briefly permitted on deck to speak to Christian, but was then forced below at bayonet-point; according to Fryer, Christian told him: \"I have been in hell for weeks past. Captain Bligh has brought this on himself.\"\nChristian originally thought to cast Bligh adrift in \"Bounty\"'s small jolly boat, together with his clerk John Samuel and the loyalist midshipmen Hayward and Hallett. This boat proved unseaworthy, so Christian ordered the launching of a larger ship's boat, with a capacity of around ten. However, Christian and his allies had overestimated the extent of the mutiny\u2014at least half on board were determined to leave with Bligh. Thus the ship's largest boat, a launch, was put into the water. During the following hours the loyalists collected their possessions and entered the boat. Among these was Fryer, who with Bligh's approval sought to stay on board\u2014in the hope, he later claimed, that he would be able to retake the ship\u2014but Christian ordered him into the launch. Soon, the vessel was badly overloaded, with more than twenty persons and others still vying for places. Christian ordered the two carpenter's mates, Norman and McIntosh, and the armourer, Joseph Coleman, to return to the ship, considering their presence essential if he were to navigate \"Bounty\" with a reduced crew. Reluctantly they obeyed, beseeching Bligh to remember that they had remained with the ship against their will. Bligh assured them: \"Never fear, lads, I'll do you justice if ever I reach England\".\nSamuel saved the captain's journal, commission papers and purser's documents, a compass and quadrant, but was forced to leave behind Bligh's maps and charts\u2014fifteen years of navigational work. With the eighteen men who had remained loyal to Bligh, the launch was supplied with about five days' food and water and Purcell's tool chest. Bligh mentions in his journals that a sextant and any time-keeper was refused by the mutineers, but boatswain's mate James Morrison stated Christian handed over his personal sextant saying, \"There, Captain Bligh, this is sufficient for every purpose and you know the sextant to be a good one.\" The ship's K2 chronometer was left on \"Bounty\", but Peckover had his own pocket watch that Bligh used to keep time. At the last minute the mutineers threw four cutlasses down into the boat. Of \"Bounty\"'s complement\u201444 after the deaths of Huggan and Valentine\u201419 men were crowded into the launch, leaving it dangerously low in the water with only seven inches of freeboard. The 25 men remaining on \"Bounty\" included the committed mutineers who had taken up arms, the loyalists detained against their will, and others for whom there was no room in the launch. At around 10:00 the line holding the launch to the ship was cut; a little later, Bligh ordered a sail to be raised. Their immediate destination was the nearby island of Tofua, clearly marked on the horizon by the plume of smoke rising from its volcano.\nBligh's open-boat voyage.\nBligh hoped to find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in provisioning the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded the last of his shore party and their supplies into the boat. In an attempt to free the rope from its captors, the quartermaster John Norton leapt into the water; he was immediately set upon and stoned to death.\nThe launch escaped to the open sea, where the shaken crew reconsidered their options. A visit to Tongatapu, or any island landfall, might incur similarly violent consequences; their best chance of salvation, Bligh reckoned, lay in sailing directly to the Dutch settlement of Kupang in Timor, using the rations presently on board. This was a journey of some to the west, beyond the Endeavour Strait, and it would necessitate daily rations of an ounce of bread and a quarter-pint of water for each man. The plan was unanimously agreed.\nFrom the outset, the weather was wet and stormy, with mountainous seas that constantly threatened to overwhelm the boat. When the sun appeared, Bligh noted in his daily journal that it \"gave us as much pleasure as a winter's day in England\". Bligh endeavoured to continue his journal throughout the voyage, observing, sketching, and charting as they made their way west. To keep up morale, he told stories of his prior experiences at sea, got the men singing, and occasionally said prayers. The launch made the first passage by Europeans through the Fiji Islands, but they dared not stop because of the islanders' reputation for cannibalism. On 17 May, Bligh recorded that \"our situation was miserable; always wet, and suffering extreme cold\u00a0... without the least shelter from the weather\".\nA week later with the skies clearing, birds began to appear, signalling a proximity to land. On 28 May, the Great Barrier Reef was sighted; Bligh found a navigable gap and sailed the launch into a calm lagoon. Late that afternoon, he ran the boat ashore on a small island off the coast of northeast Australia, which he named Restoration Island. Here, the men found oysters and berries in plentiful supply and were able to eat ravenously. Over the next four days, the party island-hopped northward within the lagoon, aware that their movements were being closely monitored by natives on the mainland. Strains were showing within the party; following a heated disagreement with Purcell, Bligh grabbed a cutlass and challenged the carpenter to fight. Fryer told Cole to arrest their captain but backed down after Bligh threatened to kill him if he interfered.\nOn 2 June, the launch cleared Cape York, the extreme northern point of the Australian continent. Bligh turned south-west and steered through a maze of shoals, reefs, sandbanks, and small islands. The route taken was not the Endeavour Strait, but a narrower southerly passage later known as the Prince of Wales Channel. At 20:00 that evening they reached the open Arafura Sea, still from Kupang. The following eight days encompassed some of the toughest travel of the entire journey and, by 11 June, many were close to collapse. The next day, the coast of Timor was sighted: \"It is not possible for me to describe the pleasure which the blessing of the sight of this land diffused among us\", Bligh wrote. On 14 June, with a makeshift Union Jack hoisted, they sailed into Kupang harbour.\nIn Kupang, Bligh reported the mutiny to the authorities, and wrote to his wife: \"Know then, my own Dear Betsey, I have lost the \"Bounty\"\u00a0...\" Nelson the botanist quickly succumbed to the harsh Kupang climate and died. On 20 August, the party departed for Batavia (now called Jakarta) to await a ship for Europe; the cook Thomas Hall died there, having been ill for weeks. Bligh obtained passages home for himself, his clerk Samuel, and his servant John Smith, and sailed on 16 October 1789. Four of the remainder\u2014the master's mate Elphinstone, the quartermaster Peter Linkletter, the butcher Robert Lamb and the assistant surgeon Thomas Ledward\u2014all died either in Batavia or on their journeys home.\n\"Bounty\" under Christian.\nAfter the departure of Bligh's launch, Christian divided the personal effects of the departed loyalists among the remaining crew and threw the breadfruit plants into the sea. He recognised that Bligh could conceivably survive to report the mutiny, and that anyway the non-return of \"Bounty\" would occasion a search mission, with Tahiti as its first port of call. Christian therefore headed \"Bounty\" towards the small island of Tubuai, some south of Tahiti. Tubuai had been discovered and roughly charted by Cook; except for a single small channel, it was entirely surrounded by a coral reef and could, Christian surmised, be easily defended against any attack from the sea.\n\"Bounty\" arrived at Tubuai on 28 May 1789. The reception from the native population was hostile; when a flotilla of war canoes headed for the ship, Christian used a four-pounder gun to repel the attackers. At least a dozen warriors were killed, and the rest scattered. Undeterred, Christian and an armed party surveyed the island and decided it would be suitable for their purposes. However, to create a permanent settlement, they needed compliant native labour and women. The most likely source for these was Tahiti, to which \"Bounty\" returned on 6 June. To ensure the co-operation of the Tahiti chiefs, Christian concocted a story that he, Bligh, and Cook were founding a new settlement at Aitutaki. Although Cook had actually been killed ten years earlier, the use of his name ensured generous gifts of livestock and other goods and, on 16 June, the well-provisioned \"Bounty\" sailed back to Tubuai. On board were nearly thirty Tahitian men and women, some of whom were there by deception.\nFor the next two months, Christian and his forces struggled to establish themselves on Tubuai. They began to construct a large moated enclosure\u2014called \"Fort George\", after the British king\u2014to provide a secure fortress against attack by land or sea. Christian attempted to form friendly relations with the local chiefs, but his party was unwelcome. There were persistent clashes with the native population, mainly over property and women, culminating in a pitched battle in which 66 islanders were killed and many wounded. Discontent was rising among the \"Bounty\" party, and Christian sensed that his authority was slipping. He called a meeting to discuss future plans and offered a free vote. Eight remained loyal to Christian, the hard core of the active mutineers, but sixteen wished to return to Tahiti and take their chances there. Christian accepted this decision; after depositing the majority at Tahiti, he would \"run before the wind, and\u00a0... land upon the first island the ship drives. After what I have done I cannot remain at Tahiti.\" In order to flee, \"Bounty\" cut the ropes to two anchors in the bay; one was recovered by , while the other was rediscovered in 1957.\nMutineers divided.\nWhen \"Bounty\" returned to Tahiti, on 22 September, the welcome was much less effusive than previously. The Tahitians had learned from the crew of a visiting British ship that the story of Cook and Bligh founding a settlement in Aitutaki was a fabrication, and that Cook had been long dead. Christian worried that their reaction might turn violent and did not stay long. Of the sixteen men who had voted to settle in Tahiti, he allowed fifteen ashore; Joseph Coleman was detained on the ship, as Christian required his skills as an armourer.\nThat evening, Christian coaxed aboard \"Bounty\" a party of Tahitians, mainly women, for a social gathering. With the festivities underway, he cut the anchor rope and \"Bounty\" sailed away with its captive guests. Coleman escaped by diving overboard and reached land. Among the abducted group were six elderly women, for whom Christian had no use; he put them ashore on the nearby island of Mo'orea. \"Bounty\"'s complement now comprised nine mutineers\u2014Christian, Young, Quintal, Brown, Martin, John Williams, John Mills, William McCoy and John Adams (known by the crew as \"Alexander Smith\")\u2014and twenty Polynesians, of whom fourteen were women.\nThe sixteen sailors on Tahiti began to organise their lives. One group, led by Morrison and Tom McIntosh, began building a schooner, which they named \"Resolution\" after Cook's ship. Morrison had not been an active mutineer; rather than waiting for recapture, he hoped to sail the vessel to the Dutch East Indies and surrender to the authorities there, hoping that such action would confirm his innocence. Morrison's group maintained ship's routine and discipline, even to the extent of holding divine service each Sunday. Churchill and Matthew Thompson, on the other hand, chose to lead drunken and generally dissolute lives, which ended in the violent deaths of both. Churchill was murdered by Thompson, who was in turn killed by Churchill's native friends. Others, such as Stewart and Heywood, settled into quiet domesticity; Heywood spent much of his time studying the Tahitian language. He adopted native dress and, in accordance with the local custom, was heavily tattooed on his body.\nRetribution.\nHMS \"Pandora\" mission.\nWhen Bligh landed in England on 14 March 1790, news of the mutiny had preceded him and he was f\u00eated as a hero. In October 1790 at a formal court-martial for the loss of \"Bounty\", he was honourably acquitted of responsibility for the loss and was promoted to post-captain. As an adjunct to the court-martial, Bligh brought charges against Purcell for misconduct and insubordination; the former carpenter received a reprimand.\nIn November 1790, the Admiralty despatched the frigate HMS \"Pandora\", under Captain Edward Edwards, to capture the mutineers and return them to England to stand trial. \"Pandora\" arrived at Tahiti on 23 March 1791 and, within a few days, all fourteen surviving \"Bounty\" men had either surrendered or been captured. Edwards made no distinction between mutineers and those who claimed they had been detained on \"Bounty\" unwillingly; all were incarcerated in a specially constructed prison erected on \"Pandora\"'s quarterdeck, dubbed \"Pandora's Box\". \"Pandora\" remained at Tahiti for five weeks while Edwards unsuccessfully sought information on \"Bounty\"'s whereabouts. The ship finally sailed on 8 May to search for \"Bounty\" among the thousands of southern Pacific islands. Apart from a few spars discovered at Palmerston Island, no traces of the fugitive vessel were found. Edwards continued the search until August, when he turned west and headed for the Dutch East Indies. One of the islands \"Pandora\" sailed to, but did not land at, was Pitcairn Island; had Edwards checked his charts and found that this uncharted island was at the correct latitude but wrong longitude for Pitcairn Island, he could very well have fulfilled his mission by capturing the last nine \"Bounty\" mutineers. Edwards' search for the remaining mutineers ultimately proved fruitless.\nWhen passing Vanikoro on 13 August 1791, Edwards observed smoke signals rising from the island. Edwards, single-minded in his search for \"Bounty\" and convinced that mutineers fearful of discovery would not be advertising their whereabouts, ignored the smoke signals and sailed on. Wahlroos argues that the smoke signals were almost certainly a distress message sent by survivors of the Lap\u00e9rouse expedition, which later evidence indicated were still alive on Vanikoro at that time\u2014three years after their ships \"Boussole\" and \"Astrolabe\" had foundered. Wahlroos is \"virtually certain\" that Edwards, whom he characterizes as one of England's most \"ruthless\", \"inhuman\", \"callous\", and \"incompetent\" naval captains, missed his chance to become \"one of the heroes of maritime history\" by solving the mystery of the lost expedition.\nOn 29 August 1791, \"Pandora\" ran aground on the outer Great Barrier Reef. The men in \"Pandora's Box\" were ignored as the regular crew attempted to prevent the ship from foundering. When Edwards gave the order to abandon ship, \"Pandora\"'s armourer began to remove the prisoners' shackles, but the ship sank before he had finished. Heywood and nine other prisoners escaped; four \"Bounty\" men\u2014George Stewart, Henry Hillbrant, Richard Skinner and John Sumner\u2014drowned, along with 31 of \"Pandora\"'s crew. The survivors, including the ten remaining prisoners, then embarked on an open-boat journey that largely followed Bligh's course of two years earlier. The prisoners were mostly kept bound hand and foot until they reached Kupang port on 17 September.\nThe prisoners were confined for seven weeks, at first in prison and later on a Dutch East India Company ship, before being transported to Cape Town. On 5 April 1792, they embarked for England on a British warship, , and arrived at Portsmouth on 19 June. There they were transferred to the guardship to await trial. The prisoners included the three detained loyalists\u2014Coleman, McIntosh and Norman\u2014to whom Bligh had promised justice; the blind fiddler Michael Byrne (or \"Byrn\"); Heywood; Morrison; and four active mutineers: Thomas Burkett, John Millward, Thomas Ellison and William Muspratt. Bligh, who had been given command of HMS \"Providence\" for a second breadfruit expedition, had left England in August 1791 and thus would be absent from the pending court-martial proceedings.\nCourt martial, verdict, and sentences.\nThe court-martial opened on 12 September 1792 on in Portsmouth Harbour, with Vice-Admiral Lord Hood, Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth, presiding. Heywood's family secured him competent legal advisers; of the other defendants, only Muspratt employed legal counsel. The survivors of Bligh's open-boat journey gave evidence against their former comrades\u2014the testimonies from Thomas Hayward and John Hallett were particularly damaging to Heywood and Morrison, who each maintained their innocence of any mutinous intention and had surrendered voluntarily to \"Pandora\". The court did not challenge the statements of Coleman, McIntosh, Norman and Byrne, all of whom were acquitted. On 18 September the six remaining defendants were found guilty of mutiny and were sentenced to death by hanging, with recommendations of mercy for Heywood and Morrison \"in consideration of various circumstances\".\nOn 26 October 1792 Heywood and Morrison received royal pardons from King George III and were released. Muspratt, through his lawyer, won a stay of execution by filing a petition protesting that court-martial rules had prevented his calling Norman and Byrne as witnesses in his defence. He was still awaiting the outcome when Burkett, Ellison and Millward were hanged from the yardarm of in Portsmouth dock on 28 October. Some accounts claim that the condemned trio continued to protest their innocence until the last moment, while others speak of their \"manly firmness that\u00a0... was the admiration of all\". There was some unease expressed in the press\u2014a suspicion that \"money had bought the lives of some, and others fell sacrifice to their poverty.\" A report that Heywood was heir to a large fortune was unfounded; nevertheless, Dening asserts that \"in the end it was class or relations or patronage that made the difference.\" In December Muspratt heard that he was reprieved, and on 11 February 1793 he, too, was pardoned and freed.\nAftermath.\nMuch of the court-martial testimony was critical of Bligh's conduct\u2014by the time of his return to England in August 1793, following his successful conveyance of breadfruit to the West Indies aboard \"Providence\", professional and public opinion had turned against him. He was snubbed at the Admiralty when he went to present his report, and was left on half pay for nineteen months before receiving his next appointment. In late 1794 the jurist Edward Christian, brother of Fletcher, published his \"Appendix\" to the court-martial proceedings, which was said by the press to \"palliate the behaviour of Christian and the Mutineers, and to criminate Captain Bligh\". Bligh's position was further undermined when the loyalist gunner Peckover confirmed that much of what was alleged in the \"Appendix\" was true.\nBligh commanded HMS \"Director\" at the Battle of Camperdown in October 1797 and HMS \"Glatton\" in the Battle of Copenhagen in April 1801. In 1805, while commanding HMS \"Warrior\", he was court-martialled for using bad language to his officers and reprimanded. In 1806, he was appointed Governor of New South Wales in Australia; after two years a group of army officers arrested and deposed him in the Rum Rebellion. After his return to England, Bligh was promoted to rear-admiral in 1811 and vice-admiral in 1814, but was not offered further naval appointments. He died, aged 63, in December 1817.\nOf the pardoned mutineers, Heywood and Morrison returned to naval duty. Heywood acquired the patronage of Hood and, by 1803 at the age of 31, had achieved the rank of captain. After a distinguished career, he died in 1831. Morrison became a master gunner and was eventually lost in 1807 when HMS \"Blenheim\" foundered in the Indian Ocean. Muspratt is believed to have worked as a naval steward before his death, in or before 1798. The other principal participants in the court martial\u2014Fryer, Peckover, Coleman, McIntosh and others\u2014generally vanished from the public eye after the closing of the procedures.\nPitcairn.\nSettlement.\nAfter leaving Tahiti on 22 September 1789, Christian sailed \"Bounty\" west in search of a safe haven. He then formed the idea of settling on Pitcairn Island, far to the east of Tahiti; the island had been reported in 1767, but its exact location was never verified. After months of searching, Christian rediscovered the island on 15 January 1790, east of its recorded position. This longitudinal error contributed to the mutineers' decision to settle on Pitcairn.\nOn arrival the ship was unloaded and stripped of most of its masts and spars, for use on the island. It was set ablaze and destroyed on 23 January, either as an agreed upon precaution against discovery or as an unauthorised act by Quintal\u2014in either case, there was now no means of escape.\nPitcairn Island proved an ideal haven for the mutineers\u2014uninhabited and virtually inaccessible, with plenty of food, water, and fertile land. For a while, the mutineers and Tahitians existed peaceably. Christian settled down with Mauatua; a son, Thursday October Christian, was born, as were other children. Christian's authority as leader gradually diminished, and he became prone to long periods of brooding and introspection.\nGradually, tensions and rivalries arose over the increasing extent to which the Europeans regarded the Tahitians as their property, in particular the women who, according to Alexander, were \"passed around from one 'husband' to the other\". In September 1793 matters degenerated into extreme violence, when several of the mutineers\u2014possibly including Christian, Williams, Martin, Mills, and Brown\u2014were killed by Tahitians in a series of murders. Both Adams and one of the Tahitian women, Teehuteatuaonoa, later claimed that Christian was killed in this massacre. However, Adams' stories were inconsistent; over the years he also claimed that Christian had died of sickness or suicide. At any rate, his gravesite has never been found. According to Teehuteatuaonoa, Christian was shot and killed from behind while in the act of \"clearing away some ground for a garden\".\nIn-fighting continued thereafter, and by 1794 the six Tahitian men were all dead, killed either by the widows of the murdered mutineers or by each other. Two of the four surviving mutineers, Young and Adams, assumed leadership and secured a tenuous calm, which was disrupted by the drunkenness of McCoy and Quintal after the former distilled an alcoholic beverage from a local plant. Some of the women attempted to leave the island in a makeshift boat but could not launch it successfully. Life continued uneasily until McCoy's suicide in 1798. A year later, after Quintal threatened fresh murder and mayhem, Adams and Young killed him and were able to restore peace.\nDiscovery.\nAfter Young succumbed to asthma in 1800, Adams took responsibility for the education and well-being of the nine remaining women and nineteen children. Using the ship's Bible from \"Bounty\", he taught literacy and Christianity, and kept peace on the island. This was the situation in February 1808, when the American sealer \"Topaz\" came unexpectedly upon Pitcairn, landed, and discovered the by-then thriving community. Adams gave \"Bounty\"'s azimuth compass and marine chronometer to \"Topaz\"'s captain, Mayhew Folger. News of the discovery did not reach Britain until 1810, when it was overlooked by an Admiralty preoccupied by war with France.\nIn 1814, two British warships, HMS \"Briton\" and HMS \"Tagus\", chanced upon Pitcairn. Among those who greeted them were Thursday October Christian and George Young (Edward Young's son). The captains, Sir Thomas Staines and Philip Pipon, reported that Christian's son displayed \"in his benevolent countenance, all the features of an honest English face\". On shore they found a population of 46\u2013mainly young islanders led by Adams, upon whom the islanders' welfare was wholly dependent, according to the captains' report. After receiving Staines and Pipon's report, the Admiralty decided to take no action.\nIn the following years, many ships called at Pitcairn Island and heard Adams' various stories of the foundation of the Pitcairn settlement. Adams died in 1829, honoured as the founder and father of a community that became celebrated over the next century as an exemplar of Victorian morality. \nExplorer Luis Marden rediscovered the remains of \"Bounty\" in January 1957. After spotting remains of the rudder (which had been found in 1933 by Parkin Christian, and is still displayed in the Fiji Museum in Suva) he persuaded his editors and writers to let him dive off Pitcairn Island. After several days of dangerous diving, Marden found the remains of the ship: a rudder pin, nails, a ships boat oarlock, fittings and a \"Bounty\" anchor that he raised. Later in life, Marden wore cuff links made of nails from \"Bounty\". He also dived to the wreck of \"Pandora\" and left a \"Bounty\" nail with that vessel. Some of the \"Bounty\"'s remains, such as the ballast stones, are still partially visible in the waters of Bounty Bay. The last of \"Bounty\"'s four-pounder cannon was recovered in 1998 by an archaeological team from James Cook University and was sent to the Queensland Museum in Townsville, Queensland, Australia, to be stabilised through lengthy conservation treatment via electrolysis over a period of nearly forty months. The gun was subsequently returned to Pitcairn Island, where it has been placed on display in a new community hall.\nOver the years, many recovered \"Bounty\" artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs; in 1999, the Pitcairn Project was established by a consortium of Australian academic and historical bodies to survey and document all the remaining material, as part of a detailed study of the settlement's development.\nCultural impact.\nBiographies and history.\nBligh published his journal several months after his return to London. Titled \"Narrative of the Mutiny on the Bounty\", it was a bestseller. He published an expanded account, \"A Voyage to the South Sea\", in 1792. Bligh's narrative called the voyage one of \"uninterrupted prosperity,\" and made no mention of personal differences with the crew. The journal was heavily edited by Joseph Banks, who told Bligh: \"We shall abridge considerably what you wrote ... to satisfy the public and place you in such a point of view as they shall approve.\"\nBligh's narrative was unchallenged until the court-martial of the captured \"Bounty\" crewmembers in September 1792. In their testimony, the crew alleged that Bligh had cut their rations and Christian had been \"in hell\" due to his frequent quarrels with the captain. By contrast, Bligh's journal had claimed that he and Christian were on friendly terms and he believed the lure of Tahiti had caused the mutiny.\nThe perception of Bligh as an overbearing tyrant began with Edward Christian's \"Appendix\" of 1794. The \"Appendix\" was based on interviews with Fryer, Hayward, Purcell, John Smith, Heywood, Muspratt and Morrison. It argued that the day before the mutiny, Bligh had accused Christian of stealing his coconuts and reduced the crew's yam ration to three quarters of a pound as punishment. This left the crew \"greatly discontented ... and their discontent was increased from the consideration that they had plenty of provisions on board, and the captain was his own purser\". As purser, it was in Bligh's interest to be frugal so that he could supplement his salary by selling back surplus provisions on his return.\nApart from Bligh's journal, the first published account of the mutiny was that of Sir John Barrow, published in 1831. Barrow was a friend of the Heywood family; his book mitigated Heywood's role while emphasising Bligh's severity. The book also instigated the legend that Christian had not died on Pitcairn, but had somehow returned to England and been recognised by Heywood in Plymouth, around 1808\u20131809. An account written in 1870 by Heywood's stepdaughter Diana Belcher further exonerated Heywood and Christian and, according to Bligh biographer Caroline Alexander, \"cemented ... many falsehoods that had insinuated their way into the narrative\".\nAmong historians' attempts to portray Bligh more sympathetically are those of Richard Hough (1972) and Caroline Alexander (2003). Hough depicts \"an unsurpassed foul-weather commander ... I would go through hell and high water with him, but not for one day in the same ship on a calm sea\". Alexander presents Bligh as over-anxious, solicitous of his crew's well-being, and utterly devoted to his task. However, Bligh's reputation as the archetypal bad commander remains: \"The Baltimore Sun\"'s reviewer of Alexander's book wrote \"poetry routed science and it has held the field ever since\".\nIn film and theatre.\nIn addition to books and poems, five feature films have been made on the mutiny. The first was a 1916 silent Australian film, subsequently lost. The second, also from Australia, titled \"In the Wake of the Bounty\" (1933), was the screen debut of Errol Flynn, in the role of Christian. The impact of this film was overshadowed by that of the MGM version, \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1935), based on the popular namesake novel by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, and starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable as Bligh and Christian, respectively. The film's story was presented, says Dening, as \"the classic conflict between tyranny and a just cause\"; Laughton's portrayal became in the public mind the definitive Bligh, \"a byword for sadistic tyranny\". The film, \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962) with Trevor Howard and Marlon Brando, largely perpetuates this image of Bligh and that of Christian as tragic hero. \"The Bounty\" (1984) with Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson, attempts a nonjudgmental portrayal of Bligh and a less sympathetic image of Christian. \nIn 1998, in advance of a BBC documentary film aimed at Bligh's rehabilitation, the respective descendants of Bligh and Christian feuded over their contrary versions of the truth. Dea Birkett, the programme's presenter, suggested that \"Christian versus Bligh has come to represent rebellion versus authoritarianism, a life constrained versus a life of freedom, sexual repression versus sexual licence.\" In 2017, Channel 4 undertook a recreating of the voyage of Bligh featuring the former SBS soldier Ant Middleton.\nA musical \"Mutiny!\" played at the Piccadilly Theatre in London's West End for sixteen months from 1985. It was co-written by David Essex based on the novel \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" and starred Essex as Christian. Morecambe and Wise produced a spoof \"play what Ernie wrote\" called \"Monty on the Bonty\", starring Arthur Lowe as Bligh.\nMuseums.\nBoth Pitcairn Island Museum and Bounty Museum on Norfolk Island use objects and memorabilia to interpret the history of the mutineers.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\nOnline.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

While in the group, he adopted the name \"Kahjoh\", though the media misspelled this as \"Cujo\". \nBorn and raised in an upper middle-class family in Connecticut, Wolfe had come west and enrolled at University of California, Berkeley, studying anthropology. He got involved with a prisoner outreach project, through which he was recruited by inmate Donald DeFreeze to the group that formed the SLA. He and six other members died in Los Angeles during a law enforcement shootout and fire in the house where they were staying. His father had commissioned an investigation of the SLA. Discussed at a press conference shortly before the fire and Wolfe's death, it suggested from strong evidence that DeFreeze was a police informant and agent provocateur.\nEarly life.\nWolfe was raised in Connecticut in an upper-middle class family. His father was L.S. Wolfe Jr, a prominent anesthetist. His parents divorced when he was 15. Wolfe boarded at Northfield Mount Hermon School, a Massachusetts prep school, but his father later said he did not thrive there. After graduating from Mount Hermon, Willie chose to delay college, and took a year-long trek to the Arctic Circle. \"He asked me for $200 when he left,\" his father recalled with pride, \"and that kid came back with $60 change.\"\nMove to California and political involvement.\nIn 1971 Wolfe moved to San Francisco, where he enrolled in the University of California, Berkeley and studied anthropology. He took African-American Linguistics through the Department of Afro-American Studies, and was taught by Colston Westbrook. Through this class, Wolfe became involved in prisoners' rights, as Westbrook was associated with a prison outreach project. It had been organized by Venceremos, a largely Chicano leftist group, and a small group of Berkeley students (mostly white) became involved as volunteers as well. They started visiting the prisons to discuss politics and social justice issues with inmates, particularly at Vacaville prison, located about 50 miles away. There African-American prisoners had formed the Black Cultural Association.\nIn 1972, African-American prisoner Donald DeFreeze (Cinque) invited Wolfe and Russ Little, both white, to join his separate study group, Unisight. Inmate Thero Wheeler, a former Black Panther, was also in the clique.\nIn Robert Stone's 2005 documentary, \"\", Russ Little said of Wolfe:\nWillie was kind of like the catalyst. Willie was the one that all these different people met. Willie was like the common denominator. Willie studied anthropology at Berkeley, and it was actually through Berkeley that he got into going to prisons. Through some class, some anthropology class.\nWolfe dropped out of college in 1972 as he became more involved in radical activism.\nPrivate investigation by Willie's father.\nWhen Willie's father learned of his son's involvement in the SLA, he hired private detective Lake Headley to provide him with more information. On May 4, 1974, Headley concluded his investigation and filed a sworn affidavit of his findings. He also held a press conference to discuss them. These included:\nThat Patricia Campbell Hearst and her parents disagreed bitterly over Patricia's political and personal relations. That a love affair between a black man and Patricia Hearst did take place prior to her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Steven Weed. That Mrs. Randolph A. Hearst subjected her daughter to extreme pressure to change her personal and political relationships.\nOn May 4, 1974, Headley, along with freelance writer Donald Freed, held a press conference in San Francisco. They presented 400 pages of documentation of their findings, some of which included:\nOn May 17, 1974, \"The New York Times\" ran an article about the suggestions that DeFreeze was an informant for the Los Angeles Police Department, based on numerous charges against him being dropped, including some for possession of weapons and bombs. \nBut the major story of the day was the LAPD shootout with DeFreeze and five others in the house where they were staying. It caught on fire, and they took shelter in a crawlspace. DeFreeze committed suicide by gunshot; the five other SLA members were overcome by smoke and flames. Wolfe was one of the members who died in this fire. \nMore than 20 years later, Lake Headley co-wrote a book with freelance writer William Hoffman: \"Vegas P.I.: The Life and Times of America's Greatest Detective\" (1993). In it he presented well-documented evidence that Donald DeFreeze was a police informant and agent provocateur from the period when he was organizing the SLA.\nDeath.\nWolfe was burned to death after a gunfight with the Los Angeles Police Department and an ensuing house fire in south-central Los Angeles. His charred remains were found in the crawl space of the house, along with those of DeFreeze and Mizmoon, whose gas masks melted to their faces. Wolfe, who was not wearing a gas mask, had died from smoke inhalation during the fire. He was the first fatality during the shootout.\nNot long after, Patty Hearst, who was still at large, released another SLA recording to the media. On it, she said of Wolfe:\nCujo was the gentlest, most beautiful man I've ever known. We loved each other so much, and his love for people was so deep that he was willing to give his life for them. Neither Cujo nor I had ever loved an individual the way we loved each other. Probably this was because our relationship wasn't based on bourgeois ... values.\"\nBut when Hearst was captured and charged, she alleged that Wolfe was among the SLA men who had raped her in the early days of her kidnapping.\nAfter the fire in LA, three FBI agents knocked on the door of Willie's father at midnight, seeking his son's dental records. They would not confirm if Willie had been in the house during the siege. Two days later, Dr. Wolfe received a call from the Los Angeles County Coroner's office informing him that his son was dead.\nIn popular culture.\nWriter Stephen King gave Wolfe's nickname to the title character (a mad dog) of the novel \"Cujo\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This distinguishes them from parks and pleasure gardens where plants, usually with showy flowers, are grown for public amenity only. Botanical gardens that specialize in trees are sometimes referred to as arboretums. They are occasionally associated with zoos.\nThe earliest botanical gardens were founded in the late Renaissance at the University of Pisa (1543) and the University of Padua (1545) in Italy, for the study and teaching of medical botany. Many universities today have botanical gardens for student teaching and academic research, e.g. the Arnold Arboretum, Harvard University, US, the Bonn University Botanic Garden, Bonn, Germany, the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, Cambridge, England, the Hortus Botanicus, Leiden, Netherlands, and the Kraus Preserve of Ohio Wesleyan University, US.\nThis page lists important botanical gardens throughout the world.

It also features the largest national park in the Netherlands, founded in 2002.\nHistory.\nDuring the Roman Era it was the major mouth of the Scheldt River. Before the St. Felix's Flood of 1530, it flowed north as a river from the east end of the Westerschelde, turned west a little west of Bergen op Zoom, and then west along the north edge of what is now the Verdronken Land van Reimerswaal, and after that widened into an estuary. Parts of that lost land were later reclaimed, restricting part of the connection to the Scheldt River to a narrow channel called the Kreekrak, which silted up and became unnavigable. In 1867 the Kreekrak was closed off with a railway embankment, connecting in the process the island of Zuid-Beveland to the mainland of North Brabant. From that moment on, the Oosterschelde lost its connection with the Scheldt, and is no longer functioning as an estuary.\nNavigation and connections.\nThe Oosterschelde offers a connection to the North Sea to the west via the Roompotsluis at Neeltje Jans, the Grevelingen and Krammer to the northeast via the Grevelingensluis and Krammersluizen at the Grevelingendam and Philipsdam, the Scheldt\u2013Rhine Canal to the east via the Bergsediepsluis at the Oesterdam, the Western Scheldt to the south via the Canal through Zuid-Beveland, and the Veerse Meer to the southwest via the Zandkreeksluis at the Zandkreekdam.\nBetween Schouwen-Duiveland and Noord-Beveland there are two road connections, the Oosterscheldedam on the west and the Zeeland Bridge on the east.\nStorm surge barrier and dam.\nAfter the North Sea flood of 1953, it was decided to close off the Oosterschelde by means of a dam and a storm surge barrier. The Oosterscheldekering (Eastern Scheldt Storm Surge Barrier), between Schouwen-Duiveland and Noord-Beveland, is the largest of 13 ambitious Delta Works designed to protect a large part of the Netherlands from flooding. A four-kilometre section has huge sluice gates, which are normally open but can be closed in adverse weather.\nUpon completion of the Oosterscheldekering and Oesterdam in 1986, the ebb and flow of water decreased and thus the tidal height differential was reduced from to . As a result, the shoals are no longer being naturally replenished with sand, further disrupting the ecosystem of the estuary; the shoals are used for, among other things, food for birds and resting places for seals. To help compensate for the partial loss of the tide resulting in the sand being less stirred up and ending up on the banks, Rijkswaterstaat applied large amounts of sand to the Roggeplaat shoal in the northwestern part of the estuary in 2019 and 2020.\nOosterschelde National Park.\nSince May 8, 2002, the entire Oosterschelde has been designated as a national park. Its boundaries are the dikes of Schouwen-Duiveland, Tholen, Sint Philipsland, Noord-Beveland, Zuid-Beveland, and the dams of the Delta Works. Having an area of , it is the largest national park in the Netherlands. Total shore length is .\nThe park consists primarily of the salt waters of the Oosterschelde, but also includes some mud flats, meadows and shoals. Because of the large variety of sea life, including unique regional species, the park is popular with scuba divers. Other activities include sailing, fishing, cycling and bird watching.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Surgical castration is bilateral orchiectomy (excision of both testicles), while chemical castration uses pharmaceutical drugs to deactivate the testes. Some forms of castration cause sterilization (permanently preventing the castrated person or animal from reproducing); it also greatly reduces the production of hormones, such as testosterone and estrogen. Surgical castration in animals is often called neutering.\nCastration of animals is intended to favor a desired development of the animal or of its habits, as an anaphrodisiac or to prevent overpopulation. The parallel of castration for female animals is spaying. Castration may also refer medically to oophorectomy in female humans and animals.\nThe term \"castration\" may also be sometimes used to refer to emasculation where both the testicles \"and\" the penis are removed together. In some cultures, and in some translations, no distinction is made between the two.\nHistory.\nCastration may have arisen in the Neolithic period in response to animal husbandry, rising populations and population specialisation.\nEither surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration may be carried out in the case of prostate cancer. Testosterone-depletion treatment (either surgical removal of both testicles or chemical castration) is used to slow down the cancer. Surgical removal of one or both testicles, known as orchidectomy, is the most common treatment for testicular cancer.\nCastration has also been used in the United States on sex offenders as a way of averting their incarceration. It can greatly reduce sex drive or interest in those with sexual drives, obsessions, or behaviors, or any combination of those that may be considered deviant .\nInvoluntary castration appears in the history of warfare, sometimes used by one side to torture or demoralize their enemies.\nAfrica and the Middle East.\nOver the 13 centuries of the Arab slave trade in Africa, unknown numbers of Africans were enslaved and shipped to the Middle East.\n\"The Caliphate in Baghdad at the beginning of the 10th Century had 7,000 black eunuchs and 4,000 white eunuchs in his palace.\" The Arab slave trade typically dealt in the sale of castrated male slaves. Black boys at the age of eight to twelve had their penises and scrota completely amputated. Reportedly, about two out of three boys died, but those who survived drew high prices.\nEurope.\nSlavery.\nThe employment or enslavement of eunuchs (castrated men) was practiced in classical and Roman antiquity and continued into the Middle Ages. In the 10th century, slave traders in Verdun in France and in Bec\u00e2ne (Pechina), Spain, castrated captives who were then enslaved as harem attendants in Al-Andalus.\nPunishment.\nEdward Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\" reports castration of defeated Byzantine Greeks at the hands of the Frankish marquis Theobald of Camerino and Spoleto in the course of 10th-century wars in Italy. Gibbon also alludes to a 12th-century incident set out in William Fitzstephen's \"Vita Sancti Thomae\" (\"Life of St. Thomas\") in which Geoffrey of Anjou castrated the members of the cathedral chapter of Sens as a punishment for disobedience. In the medieval kingdom of Georgia, the 12th-century pretender Demna was castrated by his uncle George III of Georgia to ensure the supremacy of George's branch of the family. Another victim of castration was the 12th-century medieval French philosopher, scholar, teacher, and (later) monk Pierre Ab\u00e9lard. He was castrated by relatives of his lover, H\u00e9lo\u00efse. Bishop Wimund, a 12th-century English adventurer and invader of the Scottish coast, was blinded and castrated after losing a power struggle. In medieval England, men found guilty of high treason were hanged, drawn and quartered, which often included emasculation (removal of the genitalia).\nModern era.\nWim Deetman was criticized by the Dutch parliament for excluding evidence of castration in his report on sexual abuse by the Roman Catholic Church, where ten children were allegedly \"punished\" by castration in the 1950s for reporting sexual abuse by Roman Catholic priests. The Deetman Commission had rejected it as the person who reported the incident admitted it was speculative. \nIn Spain, a law against castration was used to deny sex-reassignment surgery to transgender people until the Penal Code was reformed in 1983.\nChina.\nAccording to legend, during the reign of the legendary Emperor Shun and Yu in China, in 2281 BC, castration was passed into law as a punishment, remaining so until the reign of Gaozu of Tang (618\u2013626 AD). However, it was still practiced after his reign. According to historians, it was incorporated into Chinese law during the Zhou dynasty. It was one of the five physical punishments that could be legally inflicted on criminals in China.\nRecords of castrations in China date to the Shang dynasty (c.\u20091700\u20131050 BC), when the Shang kings castrated prisoners of war.\nDuring the reign of Mu of the Zhou dynasty (10th c. BC) the Minister of Crime, Marquis Lu, reformed the law in 950 BC to make it easier for people to be sentenced to castration instead of death. This practice included not only the removal of the testicles but also the penis: both organs were cut off with a knife at the same time.\nMen were castrated and made into state slaves during the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) to perform forced labor for projects such as the Terracotta Army. The Qin government confiscated the property and enslaved the families of rapists who received castration as a punishment. Men punished with castration during the Han dynasty were also used as slave labor.\nIn the Han dynasty (206 BC\u2013220 AD), castration continued to be used as a punishment for various offences. Chinese historian Sima Qian was castrated by order of the Han Emperor of China for dissent. In another incident multiple people, including a chief scribe and his underlings, were subjected to castration.\nDuring the early part of the Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644 AD), China demanded eunuchs to be sent as tribute from Korea. Some of them oversaw the Korean concubines in the harem of the Chinese Emperor.\nWhen the Chinese overthrew Mongol rule, many Mongol captives were castrated and turned into eunuchs. When the Ming army finally captured Yunnan from Mongols in 1382, thousands of prisoners were killed and, according to the custom in times of war, their young sons\u2014including Zheng He\u2014were castrated.\nDuring the Miao Rebellions (Ming dynasty), Chinese commanders castrated thousands of Miao boys when their tribes revolted, and then distributed them as eunuch slaves as gifts to various officials.\nAt the end of the Ming dynasty, there were about 70,000 eunuchs (\u5ba6\u5b98 \"hu\u00e0ngu\u0101n\", or \u592a\u76e3 \"t\u00e0iji\u00e0n\") employed by the emperor, with some serving inside the Forbidden City.\nThe last imperial eunuch in China was Sun Yaoting who died in 1996.\nNon-Han peoples in China.\nThe Khitan people adopted the practice of using eunuchs from the Chinese and the eunuchs used were non-Khitan prisoners of war. The Khitan were a nomadic Mongolic people and originally did not have eunuchs as part of their culture. When the Khitan founded the Liao dynasty they developed a harem system with concubines and wives and adopted eunuchs as part of it. All of the eunuchs captured were ethnic Chinese from the Central Plains that came from two sources. The Khitan captured Chinese people who were already eunuchs at the Jin court when they invaded the Later Jin. Another source was during their war with the Chinese Song dynasty: the Khitan would raid China, capture Han Chinese boys as prisoners of war and emasculate them to become eunuchs. The emasculation of captured Chinese boys guaranteed a continuous supply of eunuchs to serve in the Liao dynasty harem. The Empress Dowager Xiao Chuo (Chengtian) played a large role in the raids to capture and emasculate the boys.\nChengtian took power at age 30 in 982 as a regent for her son. Some reports suggest that she personally led her own army against the Song Chinese in 986. Her army defeated them in battle, fighting the retreating Chinese army. She then ordered the castration of around 100 ethnic Chinese boys she had captured in China, supplementing the Khitan's supply of eunuchs to serve at her court, among them was Wang Ji'en. The boys were all under ten years old and were selected for their good looks.\nThe \"History of Liao\" described and praised Empress Chengtian's capture and mass castration of the Chinese boys in a biography on Wang Ji'en.\nSome legends say that the Mongol Genghis Khan was castrated by a Tangut princess using a knife, who wanted revenge against his treatment of the Tanguts and to stop him from raping her.\nDuring the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911 AD), the sons and grandsons of the rebel Yaqub Beg in China were all sentenced to castration. Surviving members of Yaqub Beg's family included his four sons, four grandchildren (two grandsons and two granddaughters), and four wives. They either died in prison in Lanzhou, Gansu, or were killed by the Chinese. His sons Yima Kuli, K'ati Kuli, Maiti Kuli, and grandson Aisan Ahung were the only survivors in 1879. They were all underage children, and put on trial, sentenced to an agonizing death if they were complicit in their father's rebellious \"sedition\", or if they were innocent of their fathers crimes, were to be sentenced to castration and serving as eunuch slaves to Chinese troops, when they reached 11 years old, and handed over to the Imperial Household to be executed or castrated. Although some sources assert that the sentence of castration was carried out, official sources from the US State Department and activists involved in the incident state that Yaqub Beg's son and grandsons had their sentence commuted to life imprisonment with a fund provided for their support.\nKorea.\nThe eunuchs of Korea, called (Korean:\u00a0; Hanja:\u00a0), were officials to the king and other royalty in traditional Korean society. The first recorded appearance of a Korean eunuch was in Goryeosa (\"History of Goryeo\"), a compilation about the Goryeo period. In 1392, with the founding of the Joseon dynasty, the system was revised, and the department was renamed the \"Department of \" (; ).\nThe system included two ranks, those of (; , \"Chief of \"), who held the official title of senior second rank, and (; , \"Common official \"), both of which held rank as officers. 140 in total served the palace in Joseon dynasty period. They also took the exam on Confucianism every month. The system was repealed in 1894 following Gabo reform.\nAccording to legend, castration consisted of daubing a boy's genitals with human feces and having a dog bite them off. During the Yuan dynasty, eunuchs became a desirable commodity for tributes, and dog bites were replaced by more sophisticated surgical techniques.\nVietnam.\nThe Vietnamese adopted the eunuch system and castration techniques from China. Records show that the Vietnamese performed castration in a painful procedure by removing the entire genitalia with both penis and testicles being cut off with a sharp knife or metal blade. The procedure was agonizing since the entire penis was cut off. The young man's thighs and abdomen would be tied, and others would pin him down on a table. The genitals would be washed with pepper water and then cut off. A tube would be then inserted into the urethra to allow urination during healing. Many Vietnamese eunuchs were products of self-castration in order to gain access to the palaces and power. In other cases, they might be paid to become eunuchs. They served in many capacities, from supervising public works, to investigating crimes, to reading public proclamations.\nL\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t was a prominent eunuch general during the L\u00fd dynasty (1009\u20131225).\nThe Tr\u1ea7n dynasty sent Vietnamese boy eunuchs as tribute to Ming dynasty China several times, in 1383, 1384 and 1385 Nguyen Dao, Nguyen Toan, Tru Ca, and Ngo Tin were among several Vietnamese eunuchs sent to China.\nDuring the Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam, the Ming Chinese under the Yongle Emperor castrated many young Vietnamese boys, choosing them for their handsomeness and ability, and brought them to Nanjing to serve as eunuchs. Among them were the architect-engineer Nguy\u1ec5n An and Nguyen Lang (). Vietnamese were among the many eunuchs of different origins found at Yongle's court. Among the eunuchs in charge of the Capital Battalions of Beijing was Xing An, a Vietnamese.\nIn the L\u00ea dynasty the Vietnamese Emperor L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4ng was aggressive in his relations with foreign countries including China. A large amount of trade between Guangdong and Vietnam happened during his reign. Early accounts recorded that the Vietnamese captured Chinese whose ships had blown off course and detained them. Young Chinese men were selected by the Vietnamese for castration to become eunuch slaves to the Vietnamese. It has been speculated by modern historians that the Chinese who were captured and castrated by the Vietnamese were involved in trade between China and Vietnam instead of actually being blown off course by the wind and they were punished as part of a crackdown on foreign trade by Vietnam.\nSeveral Malay envoys from the Malacca sultanate were attacked and captured in 1469 by the L\u00ea dynasty of Annam (Vietnam) as they were returning to Malacca from China. The Vietnamese enslaved and castrated the young from among the captured.\nA 1472 entry in the Ming Shilu reported that when some Chinese from Nanhai county escaped back to China after their ship had been blown off course into Vietnam, where they had been forced to serve as soldiers in Vietnam's military. The escapees also reported that they found out up to 100 Chinese men remained captives in Vietnam after they were caught and castrated by the Vietnamese after their ships were blown off course into Vietnam. The Chinese Ministry of Revenue responded by ordering Chinese civilians and soldiers to stop going abroad to foreign countries. China's relations with Vietnam during this period were marked by the punishment of prisoners by castration.\nA 1499 entry in the Ming Shilu recorded that 13 Chinese men from Wenchang including a young man named Wu Rui were captured by the Vietnamese after their ship was blown off course while traveling from Hainan to Guangdong's Qin subprefecture (Qinzhou), after which they ended up near the coast of Vietnam, during the Chenghua Emperor's rule (1447\u20131487). Twelve of them were enslaved to work as agricultural laborers, while the youngest, Wu Rui was selected for castration since he was the only young man and he became a eunuch attendant at the Vietnamese imperial palace in Thang Long. After years of service, he was promoted at the death of the Vietnamese ruler in 1497 to a military position in northern Vietnam. A soldier told him of an escape route back to China and Wu Rui escaped to Longzhou. The local chief planned to sell him back to the Vietnamese, but Wu was rescued by the Pingxiang magistrate and then was sent to Beijing to work as a eunuch in the palace.\nThe \"\u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t s\u1eed k\u00fd to\u00e0n th\u01b0\" records that in 1467 in An Bang province of Dai Viet (now Qu\u1ea3ng Ninh Province) a Chinese ship blew off course onto the shore. The Chinese were detained and not allowed to return to China as ordered by Le Thanh Tong. This incident may be the same one where Wu Rui was captured.\nIn the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty the poet H\u1ed3 Xu\u00e2n H\u01b0\u01a1ng mocked eunuchs in her poem as a stand-in for criticizing the government.\nCommoners were banned from undergoing castration in Vietnam; only adult men of high social rank could be castrated. Most eunuchs were born as such with a congenital abnormality. The Vietnamese government mandated that boys born with defective genitalia were to be reported to officials, in exchange for the town being freed from mandatory labor requirements. The boy would have the option of serving as a eunuch official or serving the palace women when he became ten years old. This law was put in place in 1838 during the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. The only males allowed inside the Forbidden City at Hu\u1ebf were the Emperor and his eunuchs.\nThe presence of eunuchs in Vietnam was used by the French colonizers to degrade the Vietnamese.\nAmericas.\nIn 1778, Thomas Jefferson wrote a bill in Virginia reducing the punishment for rape, polygamy, or sodomy from death to castration. Over the years, several U.S. states have passed laws regarding chemical castration for sex offenders but not one state has mandatory castration. In 2016, Alabama lawmaker Steve Hurst proposed a bill requiring certain sex offenses to require the perpetrator be castrated prior to their release from state custody.\nA 1969 study found that men institutionalized at the same facility in Kansas lived an extra 14 years, on average, if they were castrated.\nIn 1983, Judge C. Victor Pyle sentenced three men convicted of rape to choose between 30 years in prison or castration. The South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that the castration option would be cruel, however, and the men were sentenced to prison.\nPrevention of crime.\nChemical or surgical castration is practiced in many countries for people convicted of sex crimes as a prerequisite for their release from prison. The castration may be voluntary or mandated. The assumption is that it prevents future crimes. Reports are available from American and European countries for over 80 years (chemical for circa 30). The effectiveness and ethics of this treatment are heavily debated.\nA \"temporary\" \"chemical castration\" has been studied and developed as a preventive measure and punishment for several repeated sex crimes, such as rape or other sexually related violence. Where homosexuality has been criminalised or treated as a mental illness, chemical castration has been used on gay men, as in the case of Alan Turing.\nIn modern times, the Czech Republic practices surgical castration of convicted sex offenders. According to the reports compiled by Council of Europe, a human-rights forum, the central European country physically castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to April 2008. The Czech Republic defends this procedure as voluntary and effective. According to Dr. Martin Holl\u00fd, director of the Psychiatric Hospital Bohnice in Prague, none of the nearly 100 sex offenders who had been physically castrated had committed further offences. One serial offender stated that being castrated was the \"best decision\" he ever made: \"On the one hand you have to protect the potential victims and on the other hand I wanted to be protected from myself, I wanted to live like a normal person.\" Don Grubin, a professor at Newcastle University's Institute of Neuroscience who also runs a chemical castration program backed by the UK's Ministry of Justice, was initially opposed to physical castration. After visiting the Czech Republic, however, he agreed that some form of castration might be of benefit to some sex offenders.\nIn 2020, the Pakistani-controlled section of Kashmir passed a bill allowing for convicted child sex abusers to be chemically or surgically castrated.\nIn 2020, a motion calling for surgical castration of convicted rapists was defeated in the Nigerian House of Representatives. However, there remains support for the policy.\nIn 2024, Louisiana became the first U.S. state to allow judges to impose chemical castration on sex offenders. Previously, in several states, convicted offenders could choose castration, including where it was a prerequisite for parole. However, should the person choose to remain in prison, they would not be forced to be castrated.\nCriticism.\nSome criminologists argue that the reported lower recidivism rates in castrated male sex offenders compared to non-castrated ones does not conclusively prove that it is a biological effect of castration, but might be explained by other factors. One suggested factor from game theory is that men who are willing to accept castration to get a shorter prison sentence are those who value freedom from prison higher than men who are not willing to pay the price for freedom in the form of their testicles. This hypothesis could explain their apparent lower recidivism as a result of working harder to conceal the evidence for their crimes, and argue that their parole is a danger of releasing offenders who only hide their crimes more efficiently and are not any less likely to commit new crimes. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and self-fulfilling prophecy.\nTorture and war crimes.\nCastration and other forms of male genital mutilation have been practiced against enemy soldiers and civilians from ancient times to the twenty-first century. Sometimes it is practiced against living boys and men and other times against corpses.\nThe castration of defeated enemies and the taking of body parts as trophies were traditional in Ethiopia, and Ethiopian forces practiced castration and emasculation during the Second Italo-Ethiopian War (1935\u20131937). Italian aviator Tito Minniti was allegedly one victim of this practice.\nOne British RAF officer, G. C. Gardiner DSO DFC, is recorded as having been castrated after a crash landing in Syria. During the Mau Mau uprising, there were reported instances of British security forces castrating Kenyan detainees in internment camps.\nA video released during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine appeared to show Russian soldiers castrating a Ukrainian captive with a box cutter. This led to a wave of international condemnation against the Russian military for its use of torture in wartime. Many other cases of Russian troops castrating Ukrainian prisoners of war have also emerged. According to the prosecutors, 101 cases of sexual violence against Ukrainian men by occupying Russian forces have been recorded, including 50 in the Kherson region. But this is almost certainly a vast undercount, since experts say men are often reluctant to report sexual violence. \nWhen Ukrainian cities were liberated, numerous abuses by Russian forces were exposed, including castrations, in attempts to terrorize and demoralize the Ukrainian population to break their will to fight.\nMusic.\nIn Europe, when women were not permitted to sing in church or cathedral choirs in the Roman Catholic Church, boys were castrated to develop a special high voice and to prevent their voices breaking at puberty. The first documents mentioning \"castrati\" are Italian church records from the 1550s. In the baroque and classical music eras these singers were highly appreciated by opera composers as well. Mozart's \"Exultate Jubilate\", Allegri's \"Miserere\" and other pieces from this period now sung by sopranos and countertenors were written for \"castrati\". Some of the alto parts of Handel's Messiah were first sung by a \"castrato\". \"Castrati\" include Farinelli, Senesino, Carestini, and Caffarelli. The last true \"castrato\" was Alessandro Moreschi (1858\u20131922) who served in the Sistine Chapel Choir. It was not until the late 19th century that the Roman Catholic Church officially condemned the production of \"castrati\". In modern times, the Mexican Javier Medina is the only professional opera singer who can perform as a castrato, since he had an involuntary chemical castration, as a result of a cancer treatment that he had before he reached puberty.\nReligion.\nHinduism.\nIn South Asia, many hijras live in well-defined, organized, all-hijra communities, led by a guru. The power of the hijras as a sexually ambiguous category can only be understood in the religious context of Hinduism. In some Hindu beliefs, ritual, and art, the power of the combined man/woman, or androgyne, is a frequent and significant theme. Bahuchara Mata, the main object of hijra veneration, is specifically associated with transgender topics.\nChristianity.\nIn the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus of Nazareth mentions castration in a discussion about avoiding adultery and divorce that some are involuntarily castrated or born that way, while some others \"make themselves eunuchs\" willingly out of a desire to be chaste (). Given Jesus' frequent use of metaphor and hyperbole, e.g. , the Catholic Church has broadly discouraged any understanding of this passage as recommending literal \"self-castration\". That is consistent with Jesus' claims (as a rabbi) to uphold the Law given to Moses, e.g. , a Law which also discouraged literal castration . However, in his own comments Jesus had no condemnation for any of the above. In , a eunuch is baptized by Philip the Evangelist, demonstrating acceptance of castrated individuals in his church.\nThe first canon of the First Council of Nicaea in 325 AD forbade clergy members to voluntarily castrate themselves \"when in perfect health\", but freely accepted those who had been either castrated by others against their will, castrated due to a medical sickness or necessity, or those born as eunuchs.\nPaul, arguing against self-righteousness regarding circumcision in , says \"As for those agitators, I wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves!\" (NIV)\nWell-known Christian eunuchs (or alleged eunuchs) include:\nJudaism.\nJudaism strictly forbids the castration of either humans or animals. Deuteronomy 23:1 expels castrated men from the assembly of Israel; they are forbidden to marry or if married must divorce from their wives (though permitting the castrated to marry or remain married to female converts to Judaism). The laws of castration also apply to cases of irreversible or un-reversed vasectomy and all other cases where the flow of sperm is known to have been placed into a permanent state of dysfunction with either no hope or no desire to take the steps to repair.\nIsaiah 56:3\u20135 references in a positive welcoming manner eunuchs who follow after God's laws. \"Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant; Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.\"\nAccording to Rashi, Kham (Ham) castrated his father Noah and was cursed as a result.\nIn Judaism, castrated animals are deemed unfit for sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem (). Castrated members of the priestly caste are forbidden to enter certain parts of the temple, to approach the altar, or to make sacrifices, although they could eat their share of the offerings and receive the priestly and Levite gifts (Lev. 21:16\u201324).\nIslam.\nThe Muslim conquest of Persia as well as later conquests in the Byzantine Empire and India brought them into contact with eunuchs. By the eighth century, the palaces of the caliphs were staffed with many eunuch slaves which sold at a premium. A regular trade in eunuchs developed with slaves being taken to locations in Spain or Africa to be castrated, as the practice of castration was forbidden for Muslims. Eunuchs were used as harem supervisors, as mediators or servile roles, but they could also rise to be trusted advisors or military commanders.\nIn Islam, castration is considered a sin and strictly forbidden, whether one performs it on oneself or on another. In the history of slavery in the Muslim world, a fair proportion of male slaves were imported as eunuch. Levy states that according to the Quran and Islamic traditions, such emasculation was objectionable. Some jurists such as al-Baydawi considered castration to be mutilation, stipulating laws to prevent it. However, in practice, emasculation was frequent. In eighteenth-century Mecca, the majority of eunuchs were in the service of the mosques.\nMedical consequences.\nA subject of castration who is altered before the onset of puberty will retain a high voice, as well as the effects of hypogonadism, which include non-muscular build, an infantile penis, a lack of a beard, more developed subcutaneous fat. He may be taller than average, with long limbs, so called \"eunuchoid appearance\", as the production of sex hormones in puberty\u2014more specifically, estrogen via aromatization of testosterone\u2014stops long bone growth in a process called osseous maturation. The subject may lack the male distribution of axillary hair, and may develop pubic hair distributed in female pattern. They may have a low sex drive or none at all.\nCastration stops the progression of male pattern baldness. However, hair regrowth \u2013 if it occurs at all \u2013 may be limited to hair that was lost shortly before castration.\nHistorically, many eunuchs who additionally underwent a penectomy reportedly had urinary incontinence associated with the removal of the penis.\nA study of 81 historical eunuchs in Korea's royal court found a 14- to 19-year increase in lifespan compared to intact men of similar socioeconomic background; these eunuchs had a centenarian rate of over 3%.\nChemical castration.\nIn the case of chemical castration, ongoing regular injections of anti-androgens are required. Chemical castration does not actually remove the testicles or ovaries of the subject, nor is it a form of sterilization.\nWith the advent of chemical castration, physical castration in humans has been widely superseded, though some have undergone the procedure voluntarily.\nOther animals.\nHumans commonly castrate domestic animals not intended for breeding.\nDomestic animals are usually castrated to avoid unwanted or uncontrolled reproduction; to reduce or prevent other manifestations of sexual behaviour such as defending the herd from humans and other threats, or intra-herd aggression (e.g. fighting between groups of entire (uncastrated) males of a species); or to reduce other consequences of sexual behavior that may make animal husbandry more difficult, such as boundary/fence/enclosure destruction when attempting to get to nearby females of the species.\nMale horses are usually castrated (gelded) using emasculators, because stallions are rather aggressive and troublesome. The same applies to male mules, although they are sterile. Male cattle are castrated to improve fattening and docility in feedlots or for use as oxen.\nBreeding individuals are kept entire and used for breeding: they may fetch higher prices when sold.\nLivestock may be castrated when used for food to prevent indiscriminate breeding, control aggression, and improve meat and carcass quality. In domestic pigs the undesirable odour or taint of uncastrated males, called boar taint, is caused by androstenone and skatole concentrations stored in the fat tissues of the animal after sexual maturity. Boar taint is only found in a small minority of pigs and can be controlled through breeding selection, diet and management. It is released when the fat is heated and has a distinct odor and flavor that is widely considered unpalatable to consumers. Consequently, in commercial meat production, male pigs are either castrated shortly after birth or slaughtered before they reach sexual maturity. Recent research in Brazil has shown that castration of pigs is unnecessary because most pigs do not have the 'boar taint'. This is due to many breeds of pigs simply not having the heredity for the boar taint and the fact that pigs are normally slaughtered at a young market weight.\nIn the case of pets, castration is usually called neutering, and is encouraged to prevent overpopulation of the community by unwanted animals, and to reduce certain diseases such as prostate disease and testicular cancer in male dogs (oophorectomy in female pets is often called spaying). Testicular cancer is rare in dogs, and also prostate problems are somewhat common in castrated male dogs when they get older. Neutered individuals have a much higher risk of developing prostate problems in comparison to intact males. Castrated male cats are more likely to develop an obstruction in their urethra, preventing them from urinating to some degree. A specialized vocabulary has arisen for neutered animals of given species:\nAn incompletely castrated male in livestock species (horse and cattle) is known as a \"rig\".\nThe term \"stag\" is used for a male animal castrated after the secondary sex characteristics have developed to such a point as to give him the appearance of sexual maturity.\nMethods of veterinary castration include instant surgical removal, the use of an elastrator tool to secure a band around the testicles that disrupts the blood supply, the use of a Burdizzo tool or emasculators to crush the spermatic cords and disrupt the blood supply, pharmacological injections and implants and immunological techniques to inoculate the animal against his own sexual hormones.\nCertain animals, like horses and swine, are usually surgically treated with a scrotal castration (which can be done with the animal standing while sedated and after local anesthetic has been applied), while others, like dogs and cats, are anesthetised and recumbent when surgically castrated with a pre-scrotal incision in the case of dogs, or a pre-scrotal or scrotal incision used for cats.\nCastration of cattle has historically been done without pain medications. All methods of castration cause pain and distress, which can be minimized by castrating as early as possible, preferably within the first week of life. The Canadian Code of Practice for the Care and Handling of Beef Cattle requires that, as of 2018, calves older than six months be castrated using pain control.\nIn veterinary practice an \"open\" castration refers to a castration in which the inguinal tunic is incised and not sutured. A \"closed\" castration refers to when the procedure is performed so that the inguinal tunic is sutured together after incision.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69415", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69415", "title": "Economic growth", "text": "Measure of increase in market value of goods\nIn economics, economic growth is an increase in the quantity and quality of the economic goods and services that a society produces. It can be measured as the increase in the inflation-adjusted output of an economy in a given year or over a period of time.\nThe rate of growth is typically calculated as real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate, real GDP per capita growth rate or GNI per capita growth. The \"rate\" of economic growth refers to the geometric annual rate of growth in GDP or GDP per capita between the first and the last year over a period of time. This growth rate represents the trend in the average level of GDP over the period, and ignores any fluctuations in the GDP around this trend. Growth is usually calculated in \"real\" value, which is inflation-adjusted, to eliminate the distorting effect of inflation on the prices of goods produced. GDP per capita is the GDP of the entire country divided by the number of people in the country. Measurement of economic growth uses national income accounting.\nEconomists refer to economic growth caused by more efficient use of inputs (increased productivity of labor, of physical capital, of energy or of materials) as \"intensive growth\". In contrast, economic growth caused only by increases in the amount of inputs available for use (increased population, for example, or new territory) counts as \"extensive growth\". Innovation also generates economic growth. In the U.S. about 60% of consumer spending in 2013 went on goods and services that did not exist in 1869.\nThe U.S. economy experienced accelerated growth in the spring of 2025, fueled by increasing consumer expenditure and decreasing imports, as reported by new government statistics. The gross domestic product (GDP) expanded at an annualized rate of 3.8 percent during the April to June timeframe. In the initial quarter of 2025, the U.S. economy contracted at a rate of 0.6 percent as businesses relied on imports to navigate President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nDeterminants of economic growth.\nIn national income accounting, per capita output can be calculated using the following factors: output per unit of labor input (labor productivity), hours worked (intensity), the percentage of the working-age population actually working (participation rate) and the proportion of the working-age population to the total population (demographics). \"The rate of change of GDP/population is the sum of the rates of change of these four variables plus their cross products.\"\nShort-term economic changes happen around long-term changes, though they are unpredictable. Recessions may occur, causing GDP to fall, along with productivity, causing unemployment to rise.\nProductivity.\nIncreases in labor productivity (the ratio of the value of output to labor input) have historically been the most important source of real per capita economic growth. In a famous estimate, MIT Professor Robert Solow concluded that technological progress has accounted for 80 percent of the long-term rise in U.S. per capita income, with increased investment in capital explaining only the remaining 20 percent.\nIncreases in productivity lower the real cost of goods. Over the 20th century, the real price of many goods fell by over 90%.\nEconomic growth has traditionally been attributed to the accumulation of human and physical capital and the increase in productivity and creation of new goods arising from technological innovation. Further division of labour (specialization) is also fundamental to rising productivity.\nBefore industrialization, technological progress resulted in an increase in the population, which was kept in check by food supply and other resources, which acted to limit per capita income, a condition known as the Malthusian trap. The rapid economic growth that occurred during the Industrial Revolution was remarkable because it was in excess of population growth, providing an escape from the Malthusian trap. Countries that industrialized eventually saw their population growth slow down, a phenomenon known as the demographic transition.\nIncreases in productivity are the major factor responsible for per capita economic growth\u2014this has been especially evident since the mid-19th century. Most of the economic growth in the 20th century was due to increased output per unit of labor, materials, energy, and land (less input per widget). The balance of the growth in output has come from using more inputs. Both of these changes increase output. The increased output included more of the same goods produced previously and new goods and services.\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, mechanization began to replace hand methods in manufacturing, and new processes streamlined production of chemicals, iron, steel, and other products. Machine tools made the economical production of metal parts possible, so that parts could be interchangeable. (See: Interchangeable parts.)\nDuring the Second Industrial Revolution, a major factor of productivity growth was the substitution of inanimate power for human and animal labor. Also there was a great increase in power as steam-powered electricity generation and internal combustion supplanted limited wind and water power. Since that replacement, the great expansion of total power was driven by continuous improvements in energy conversion efficiency. Other major historical sources of productivity were automation, transportation infrastructures (canals, railroads, and highways), new materials (steel) and power, which includes steam and internal combustion engines and electricity. Other productivity improvements included mechanized agriculture and scientific agriculture including chemical fertilizers and livestock and poultry management, and the Green Revolution. Interchangeable parts made with machine tools powered by electric motors evolved into mass production, which is universally used today.\nGreat sources of productivity improvement in the late 19th century were railroads, steam ships, horse-pulled reapers and combine harvesters, and steam-powered factories. The invention of processes for making cheap steel were important for many forms of mechanization and transportation. By the late 19th century both prices and weekly work hours fell because less labor, materials, and energy were required to produce and transport goods. However, real wages rose, allowing workers to improve their diet, buy consumer goods and afford better housing.\nMass production of the 1920s created overproduction, which was arguably one of several causes of the Great Depression of the 1930s. Following the Great Depression, economic growth resumed, aided in part by increased demand for existing goods and services, such as automobiles, telephones, radios, electricity and household appliances. New goods and services included television, air conditioning and commercial aviation (after 1950), creating enough new demand to stabilize the work week. The building of highway infrastructures also contributed to post-World War II growth, as did capital investments in manufacturing and chemical industries. The post-World War II economy also benefited from the discovery of vast amounts of oil around the world, particularly in the Middle East. By John W. Kendrick's estimate, three-quarters of increase in U.S. per capita GDP from 1889 to 1957 was due to increased productivity.\nEconomic growth in the United States slowed down after 1973. In contrast, growth in Asia has been strong since then, starting with Japan and spreading to Four Asian Tigers, China, Southeast Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Asia Pacific. In 1957 South Korea had a lower per capita GDP than Ghana, and by 2008 it was 17 times as high as Ghana's. The Japanese economic growth has slackened considerably since the late 1980s.\nProductivity in the United States grew at an increasing rate throughout the 19th century and was most rapid in the early to middle decades of the 20th century. U.S. productivity growth spiked towards the end of the century in 1996\u20132004, due to an acceleration in the rate of technological innovation known as Moore's law. After 2004 U.S. productivity growth returned to the low levels of 1972\u201396.\nFactor accumulation.\nCapital in economics ordinarily refers to physical capital, which consists of structures (largest component of physical capital) and equipment used in business (machinery, factory equipment, computers and office equipment, construction equipment, business vehicles, medical equipment, etc.). Up to a point increases in the amount of capital per worker are an important cause of economic output growth. Capital is subject to diminishing returns because of the amount that can be effectively invested and because of the growing burden of depreciation. In the development of economic theory, the distribution of income was considered to be between labor and the owners of land and capital. In recent decades there have been several Asian countries with high rates of economic growth driven by capital investment.\nThe work week declined considerably over the 19th century. By the 1920s the average work week in the U.S. was 49 hours, but the work week was reduced to 40 hours (after which overtime premium was applied) as part of the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.\nDemographic factors may influence growth by changing the employment to population ratio and the labor force participation rate. Industrialization creates a demographic transition in which birth rates decline and the average age of the population increases.\nWomen with fewer children and better access to market employment tend to join the labor force in higher percentages. There is a reduced demand for child labor and children spend more years in school. The increase in the percentage of women in the labor force in the U.S. contributed to economic growth, as did the entrance of the baby boomers into the workforce.\nConventional growth domain.\nIt has been observed that GDP growth is influenced by the size of the economy. The relation between GDP growth and GDP across the countries at a particular point of time is convex. Growth increases as GDP reaches its maximum and then begins to decline. There exists some extremum value. This is not exactly middle-income trap. It is observed for both developed and developing economies. Actually, countries having this property belong to \"conventional growth domain\". However, the extremum could be extended by technological and policy innovations and some countries move into \"innovative growth domain\" with higher limiting values.\nHuman capital.\nMany theoretical and empirical analyses of economic growth attribute a major role to a country's level of human capital, defined as the skills of the population or the work force. Human capital has been included in both neoclassical and endogenous growth models.\nA country's level of human capital is difficult to measure since it is created at home, at school, and on the job. Economists have attempted to measure human capital using numerous proxies, including the population's level of literacy, its level of numeracy, its level of book production/capita, its average level of formal schooling, its average test score on international tests, and its cumulative depreciated investment in formal schooling. The most commonly used measure of human capital is the level (average years) of school attainment in a country, building upon the data development of Robert Barro and Jong-Wha Lee. This measure is widely used because Barro and Lee provide data for numerous countries in five-year intervals for a long period of time.\nOne problem with the schooling attainment measure is that the amount of human capital acquired in a year of schooling is not the same at all levels of schooling and is not the same in all countries. This measure also presumes that human capital is only developed in formal schooling, contrary to the extensive evidence that families, neighborhoods, peers, and health also contribute to the development of human capital. Despite these potential limitations, Theodore Breton has shown that this measure can represent human capital in log-linear growth models because across countries GDP/adult has a log-linear relationship to average years of schooling, which is consistent with the log-linear relationship between workers' personal incomes and years of schooling in the Mincer model.\nEric Hanushek and Dennis Kimko introduced measures of students' mathematics and science skills from international assessments into growth analysis. They found that this measure of human capital was very significantly related to economic growth. Eric Hanushek and Ludger W\u00f6\u00dfmann have extended this analysis. Theodore Breton shows that the correlation between economic growth and students' average test scores in Hanushek and W\u00f6\u00dfmann's analyses is actually due to the relationship in countries with less than eight years of schooling. He shows that economic growth is not correlated with average scores in more educated countries. Hanushek and W\u00f6\u00dfmann further investigate whether the relationship of knowledge capital to economic growth is causal. They show that the level of students' cognitive skills can explain the slow growth in Latin America and the rapid growth in East Asia.\nJoerg Baten and Jan Luiten van Zanden employ book production per capita as a proxy for sophisticated literacy capabilities and find that \"Countries with high levels of human capital formation in the 18th century initiated or participated in the industrialization process of the 19th century, whereas countries with low levels of human capital formation were unable to do so, among them many of today's Less Developed Countries such as India, Indonesia, and China.\"\nHealth.\nHere, health is approached as a functioning from Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum's capability approach that an individual has to realise the achievements like economic success. Thus health in a broader sense is not the absence of illness, but the opportunity for people to biologically develop to their full potential their entire lives It is established that human capital is an important asset for economic growth, however, it can only be so if that population is healthy and well-nourished. One of the most important aspects of health is the mortality rate and how the rise or decline can affect the labour supply predominant in a developing economy. Mortality decline triggers greater investments in individual human capital and an increase in economic growth. Matteo Cervellati and Uwe Sunde and Rodrigo.R Soares consider frameworks in which mortality decline has an influence on parents to have fewer children and to provide quality education for those children, as a result instituting an economic-demographic transition.\nThe relationship between health and economic growth is further nuanced by distinguishing the influence of specific diseases on GDP per capita from that of aggregate measures of health, such as life expectancy Thus, investing in health is warranted both from the growth and equity perspectives, given the important role played by health in the economy. Protecting health assets from the impact of systemic transitional costs on economic reforms, pandemics, economic crises and natural disasters is also crucial. Protection from the shocks produced by illness and death, are usually taken care of within a country's social insurance system. In areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa, where the prevalence of HIV and AIDS, has a comparative negative impact on economical development. It will be interesting to see how research in the areas of health in near future uncover how the world will be performing living with the SARS-CoV-2, especially looking at the economic impacts it already has in a space of two years. Ultimately, when people live longer on average, human capital expenditures are more likely to pay off, and all of these mechanisms center around the complementarity of longevity, health, and education, for which there is ample empirical evidence.\nPolitical institutions.\n\"As institutions influence behavior and incentives in real life, they forge the success or failure of nations.\"\nIn economics and economic history, the transition from earlier economic systems to capitalism was facilitated by the adoption of government policies which fostered commerce and gave individuals more personal and economic freedom. These included new laws favorable to the establishment of business, including contract law, laws providing for the protection of private property, and the abolishment of anti-usury laws.\nMuch of the literature on economic growth refers to the success story of the British state after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, in which high fiscal capacity combined with constraints on the power of the king generated some respect for the rule of law. However, others have questioned that this institutional formula is not so easily replicable elsewhere as a change in the Constitution\u2014and the type of institutions created by that change\u2014does not necessarily create a change in political power if the economic powers of that society are not aligned with the new set of rule of law institutions. In England, a dramatic increase in the state's fiscal capacity followed the creation of constraints on the crown, but elsewhere in Europe increases in state capacity happened before major rule of law reforms.\nThere are many different ways through which states achieved state (fiscal) capacity and this different capacity accelerated or hindered their economic development. Thanks to the underlying homogeneity of its land and people, England was able to achieve a unified legal and fiscal system since the Middle Ages that enabled it to substantially increase the taxes it raised after 1689. On the other hand, the French experience of state building faced much stronger resistance from local feudal powers keeping it legally and fiscally fragmented until the French Revolution despite significant increases in state capacity during the seventeenth century. Furthermore, Prussia and the Habsburg empire\u2014much more heterogeneous states than England\u2014were able to increase state capacity during the eighteenth century without constraining the powers of the executive. Nevertheless, it is unlikely that a country will generate institutions that respect property rights and the rule of law without having had first intermediate fiscal and political institutions that create incentives for elites to support them. Many of these intermediate level institutions relied on informal private-order arrangements that combined with public-order institutions associated with states, to lay the foundations of modern rule of law states.\nIn many poor and developing countries much land and housing are held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system. In many urban areas the poor \"invade\" private or government land to build their houses, so they do not hold title to these properties. Much unregistered property is held in informal form through various property associations and other arrangements. Reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building; failures to notarize transaction documents; or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency. According to Hernando De Soto, unclear property rights limits economic growth, as people cannot use land as collateral to secure loans, depriving many poor countries of one of their most important potential sources of capital. Unregistered businesses and lack of accepted accounting methods are other factors that limit potential capital. Businesses and individuals participating in unreported business activity and owners of unregistered property face costs such as bribes and pay-offs that offset much of any taxes avoided.\nAccording to Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson and James Robinson, the positive correlation between high income and cold climate is a by-product of history. Europeans adopted very different colonization policies in different colonies, with different associated institutions. In places where these colonizers faced high mortality rates (e.g., due to the presence of tropical diseases), they could not settle permanently, and they were thus more likely to establish extractive institutions, which persisted after independence; in places where they could settle permanently (e.g. those with temperate climates), they established institutions with this objective in mind and modeled them after those in their European homelands. In these 'neo-Europes' better institutions in turn produced better development outcomes. Thus, although other economists focus on the identity or type of legal system of the colonizers to explain institutions, these authors look at the environmental conditions in the colonies to explain institutions. For instance, former colonies have inherited corrupt governments and geopolitical boundaries (set by the colonizers) that are not properly placed regarding the geographical locations of different ethnic groups, creating internal disputes and conflicts that hinder development. In another example, societies that emerged in colonies without solid native populations established better property rights and incentives for long-term investment than those where native populations were large.\nUNESCO and the United Nations consider that cultural property protection, high-quality education, cultural diversity and social cohesion in armed conflicts are particularly necessary for qualitative growth.\nEconomic growth, its sustainability and its distribution remain central aspects of government policy. For example, the UK Government recognises that \"Government can play an important role in supporting economic growth by helping to level the playing field through the way it buys public goods, works and services\", and \"Post-Pandemic Economic Growth\" has been featured in a series of inquiries undertaken by the parliamentary Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, which argues that the UK Government \"has a big job to do in helping businesses survive, stimulating economic growth and encouraging the creation of well-paid meaningful jobs\".\nDemocracy and economic growth.\n\"Democracy Does Cause Growth\", according to Acemoglu \"et al.\" Specifically, they state that \"democracy increases future GDP by encouraging investment, increasing schooling, inducing economic reforms, improving public goods provision, and reducing social unrest\".\nIn \"Why Nations Fail\", Acemoglu and Robinson said that the English in North America started by trying to repeat the success of the Spanish Conquistadors in extracting wealth (especially gold and silver) from the countries they had conquered. This system repeatedly failed for the English. Their successes rested on giving land and a voice in the government to every male settler to incentivize productive labor. In Virginia it took twelve years and many deaths from starvation before the governor decided to try democracy.\nEntrepreneurs and new products.\nPolicymakers and scholars frequently emphasize the importance of entrepreneurship for economic growth. However, surprisingly few research empirically examine and quantify entrepreneurship's impact on growth. This is due to endogeneity\u2014forces that drive economic growth also drive entrepreneurship. In other words, the empirical analysis of the impact of entrepreneurship on growth is difficult because of the joint determination of entrepreneurship and economic growth. A few papers use quasi-experimental designs, and have found that entrepreneurship and the density of small businesses indeed have a causal impact on regional growth.\nAnother major cause of economic growth is the introduction of new products and services and the improvement of existing products. New products create demand, which is necessary to offset the decline in employment that occurs through labor-saving technology (and to a lesser extent employment declines due to savings in energy and materials). In the U.S. by 2013 about 60% of consumer spending was for goods and services that did not exist in 1869. Also, the creation of new services has been more important than invention of new goods.\nStructural change.\nEconomic growth in the U.S. and other developed countries went through phases that affected growth through changes in the labor force participation rate and the relative sizes of economic sectors. The transition from an agricultural economy to manufacturing increased the size of the sector with high output per hour (the high-productivity manufacturing sector), while reducing the size of the sector with lower output per hour (the lower productivity agricultural sector). Eventually high productivity growth in manufacturing reduced the sector size, as prices fell and employment shrank relative to other sectors. The service and government sectors, where output per hour and productivity growth is low, saw increases in their shares of the economy and employment during the 1990s. The public sector has since contracted, while the service economy expanded in the 2000s.\nGrowth theories.\nAdam Smith.\nAdam Smith pioneered modern economic growth and performance theory in his book The Wealth of Nations\",\" first published in 1776. For Smith, the main factors of economic growth are division of labour and capital accumulation. However, these are conditioned by what he calls \"the extent of the market\". This is conditioned notably by geographic factors but also institutional ones such as the political-legal environment.\nMalthusian theory.\nMalthusianism is the idea that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population die off. The Malthusian theory also proposes that over most of human history technological progress caused larger population growth but had no impact on income per capita in the long run. According to the theory, while technologically advanced economies over this epoch were characterized by higher population density, their level of income per capita was not different from those among technologically regressed society.\nThe conceptual foundations of the Malthusian theory were formed by Thomas Malthus, and a modern representation of these approach is provided by Ashraf and Galor. In line with the predictions of the Malthusian theory, a cross-country analysis finds a significant positive effect of the technological level on population density and an insignificant effect on income per capita significantly over the years 1\u20131500.\nClassical growth theory.\nIn classical (Ricardian) economics, the theory of production and the theory of growth are based on the theory of sustainability and law of variable proportions, whereby increasing either of the factors of production (labor or capital), while holding the other constant and assuming no technological change, will increase output, but at a diminishing rate that eventually will approach zero. These concepts have their origins in Thomas Malthus's theorizing about agriculture. Malthus's examples included the number of seeds harvested relative to the number of seeds planted (capital) on a plot of land and the size of the harvest from a plot of land versus the number of workers employed. (See also Diminishing returns)\nCriticisms of classical growth theory are that technology, an important factor in economic growth, is held constant and that economies of scale are ignored.\nOne popular theory in the 1940s was the big push model, which suggested that countries needed to jump from one stage of development to another through a virtuous cycle, in which large investments in infrastructure and education coupled with private investments would move the economy to a more productive stage, breaking free from economic paradigms appropriate to a lower productivity stage. The idea was revived and formulated rigorously, in the late 1980s by Kevin Murphy, Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny.\nSolow\u2013Swan model.\nRobert Solow and Trevor Swan developed what eventually became the main model used in growth economics in the 1950s. This model assumes that there are diminishing returns to capital and labor. Capital accumulates through investment, but its level or stock continually decreases due to depreciation. Due to the diminishing returns to capital, with increases in capital/worker and absent technological progress, economic output/worker eventually reaches a point where capital per worker and economic output/worker remain constant because annual investment in capital equals annual depreciation. This condition is called the 'steady state'.\nIn the Solow\u2013Swan model if productivity increases through technological progress, then output/worker increases even when the economy is in the steady state. If productivity increases at a constant rate, output/worker also increases at a related steady-state rate. As a consequence, growth in the model can occur either by increasing the share of GDP invested or through technological progress. But at whatever share of GDP invested, capital/worker eventually converges on the steady state, leaving the growth rate of output/worker determined only by the rate of technological progress. As a consequence, with world technology available to all and progressing at a constant rate, all countries have the same steady state rate of growth. Each country has a different level of GDP/worker determined by the share of GDP it invests, but all countries have the same rate of economic growth. Implicitly in this model rich countries are those that have invested a high share of GDP for a long time. Poor countries can become rich by increasing the share of GDP they invest. One important prediction of the model, mostly borne out by the data, is that of \"conditional convergence\"; the idea that poor countries will grow faster and catch up with rich countries as long as they have similar investment (and saving) rates and access to the same technology.\nThe Solow\u2013Swan model is considered an \"exogenous\" growth model because it does not explain why countries invest different shares of GDP in capital nor why technology improves over time. Instead, the rate of investment and the rate of technological progress are exogenous. The value of the model is that it predicts the pattern of economic growth once these two rates are specified. Its failure to explain the determinants of these rates is one of its limitations.\nAlthough the rate of investment in the model is exogenous, under certain conditions the model implicitly predicts convergence in the rates of investment across countries. In a global economy with a global financial capital market, financial capital flows to the countries with the highest return on investment. In the Solow-Swan model countries with less capital/worker (poor countries) have a higher return on investment due to the diminishing returns to capital. As a consequence, capital/worker and output/worker in a global financial capital market should converge to the same level in all countries. Since historically financial capital has not flowed to the countries with less capital/worker, the basic Solow\u2013Swan model has a conceptual flaw. Beginning in the 1990s, this flaw has been addressed by adding additional variables to the model that can explain why some countries are less productive than others and, therefore, do not attract flows of global financial capital even though they have less (physical) capital/worker.\nIn practice, convergence was rarely achieved. In 1957, Solow applied his model to data from the U.S. gross national product to estimate contributions. This showed that the increase in capital and labor stock only accounted for about half of the output, while the population increase adjustments to capital explained eighth. This remaining unaccounted growth output is known as the Solow Residual. Here the A of (t) \"technical progress\" was the reason for increased output. Nevertheless, the model still had flaws. It gave no room for policy to influence the growth rate. Few attempts were also made by the RAND Corporation the non-profit think tank and frequently visiting economist Kenneth Arrow to work out the kinks in the model. They suggested that new knowledge was indivisible and that it is endogenous with a certain fixed cost. Arrow's further explained that new knowledge obtained by firms comes from practice and built a model that \"knowledge\" accumulated through experience.\nEndogenous growth theory.\nUnsatisfied with the assumption of exogenous technological progress in the Solow\u2013Swan model, economists worked to \"endogenize\" (i.e., explain it \"from within\" the models) productivity growth in the 1980s. The resulting endogenous growth theory, most notably advanced by Robert Lucas, Jr. and his student Paul Romer, includes a mathematical explanation of technological advancement. This model was notable for its incorporation of human capital, which is interpreted from changes to investment patterns in education, training, and healthcare by private sector firms or governments. Notwithstanding the implications this component has for policy, the endogenous perspective on human capital investment emphasizes the possibility for broad-based effects which can be realized by other firms in the economy. Accordingly, human capital is theorized to deliver increasing rates of return unlike physical capital. Research done in this area has focused on what increases human capital (e.g. education) or technological change (e.g. innovation). \nOn Memorial Day weekend in 1988, a conference in Buffalo brought together influential thinkers to evaluate the conflicting theories of growth. Romer, Krugman, Barro, and Becker were in attendance along with many other high profiled economists of the time. Amongst many papers that day the one that stood out was Romer's \"Micro Foundations for Aggregate Technological Change.\" The Micro Foundation claimed that endogenous technological change had the concept of Intellectual Property imbedded and that knowledge is an input and output of production. Romer argued that outcomes to the national growth rates were significantly affected by public policy, trade activity, and intellectual property. He stressed that cumulative capital and specialization were key, and that not only population growth can increase capital of knowledge, it was human capital that is specifically trained in harvesting new ideas.\nWhile intellectual property may be important, Baker (2016) cites multiple sources claiming that \"stronger patent protection seems to be associated with slower growth\". That's particularly true for patents in the ethical health care industry. In effect taxpayers pay twice for new drugs and diagnostic procedures: First in tax subsidies and second for the high prices of diagnostic procedures treatments. If the results of research paid by taxpayers were placed in the public domain, Baker claims that people everywhere would be healthier, because better diagnoses and treatment would be more affordable the world over.\nOne branch of endogenous growth theory was developed on the foundations of the Schumpeterian theory, named after the 20th-century Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter. The approach explains growth as a consequence of innovation and a process of creative destruction that captures the dual nature of technological progress: in terms of creation, entrepreneurs introduce new products or processes in the hope that they will enjoy temporary monopoly-like profits as they capture markets. In doing so, they make old technologies or products obsolete. This can be seen as an \"annulment\" of previous technologies, which makes them obsolete, and \"destroys the rents generated by previous innovations\". A major model that illustrates Schumpeterian growth is the Aghion\u2013Howitt model.\nUnified growth theory.\nUnified growth theory was developed by Oded Galor and his co-authors to address the inability of endogenous growth theory to explain key empirical regularities in the growth processes of individual economies and the world economy as a whole. Unlike endogenous growth theory that focuses entirely on the modern growth regime and is therefore unable to explain the roots of inequality across nations, unified growth theory captures in a single framework the fundamental phases of the process of development in the course of human history: (i) the Malthusian epoch that was prevalent over most of human history, (ii) the escape from the Malthusian trap, (iii) the emergence of human capital as a central element in the growth process, (iv) the onset of the fertility decline, (v) the origins of the modern era of sustained economic growth, and (vi) the roots of divergence in income per capita across nations in the past two centuries. The theory suggests that during most of human existence, technological progress was offset by population growth, and living standards were near subsistence across time and space. However, the reinforcing interaction between the rate of technological progress and the size and composition of the population has gradually increased the pace of technological progress, enhancing the importance of education in the ability of individuals to adapt to the changing technological environment. The rise in the allocation of resources towards education triggered a fertility decline enabling economies to allocate a larger share of the fruits of technological progress to a steady increase in income per capita, rather than towards the growth of population, paving the way for the emergence of sustained economic growth. The theory further suggests that variations in biogeographical characteristics, as well as cultural and institutional characteristics, have generated a differential pace of transition from stagnation to growth across countries and consequently divergence in their income per capita over the past two centuries.\nInequality and growth.\nTheories.\nThe prevailing views about the role of inequality in the growth process has radically shifted in the past century.\nThe classical perspective, as expressed by Adam Smith, and others, suggests that inequality fosters the growth process. Specifically, since the aggregate saving increases with inequality due to higher property to save among the wealthy, the classical viewpoint suggests that inequality stimulates capital accumulation and therefore economic growth.\nThe Neoclassical perspective that is based on representative agent approach denies the role of inequality in the growth process. It suggests that while the growth process may affect inequality, income distribution has no impact on the growth process.\nThe modern perspective which has emerged in the late 1980s suggests, in contrast, that income distribution has a significant impact on the growth process. The modern perspective, originated by Galor and Zeira, highlights the important role of heterogeneity in the determination of aggregate economic activity, and economic growth. In particular, Galor and Zeira argue that since credit markets are imperfect, inequality has an enduring impact on human capital formation, the level of income per capita, and the growth process. In contrast to the classical paradigm, which underlined the positive implications of inequality for capital formation and economic growth, Galor and Zeira argue that inequality has an adverse effect on human capital formation and the development process, in all but the very poor economies.\nLater theoretical developments have reinforced the view that inequality has an adverse effect on the growth process. Specifically, Alesina and Rodrik and Persson and Tabellini advance a political economy mechanism and argue that inequality has a negative impact on economic development since it creates a pressure for distortionary redistributive policies that have an adverse effect on investment and economic growth.\nIn accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, a study by Roberto Perotti showed that inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, while lower level of human capital is associated with lower growth and lower levels of economic growth. In contrast, his examination of the political economy channel found no support for the political economy mechanism. Consequently, the political economy perspective on the relationship between inequality and growth have been revised and later studies have established that inequality may provide an incentive for the elite to block redistributive policies and institutional changes. In particular, inequality in the distribution of land ownership provides the landed elite with an incentive to limit the mobility of rural workers by depriving them from education and by blocking the development of the industrial sector.\nA unified theory of inequality and growth that captures that changing role of inequality in the growth process offers a reconciliation between the conflicting predictions of classical viewpoint that maintained that inequality is beneficial for growth and the modern viewpoint that suggests that in the presence of credit market imperfections, inequality predominantly results in underinvestment in human capital and lower economic growth. This unified theory of inequality and growth, developed by Oded Galor and Omer Moav, suggests that the effect of inequality on the growth process has been reversed as human capital has replaced physical capital as the main engine of economic growth. In the initial phases of industrialization, when physical capital accumulation was the dominating source of economic growth, inequality boosted the development process by directing resources toward individuals with higher propensity to save. However, in later phases, as human capital become the main engine of economic growth, more equal distribution of income, in the presence of credit constraints, stimulated investment in human capital and economic growth.\nIn 2013, French economist Thomas Piketty postulated that in periods when the average annual rate on return on investment in capital (\"r\") exceeds the average annual growth in economic output (\"g\"), the rate of inequality will increase. According to Piketty, this is the case because wealth that is already held or inherited, which is expected to grow at the rate \"r\", will grow at a rate faster than wealth accumulated through labor, which is more closely tied to \"g\". An advocate of reducing inequality levels, Piketty suggests levying a global wealth tax in order to reduce the divergence in wealth caused by inequality.\nEvidence: reduced form.\nThe reduced form empirical relationship between inequality and growth was studied by Alberto Alesina and Dani Rodrik, and Torsten Persson and Guido Tabellini. They find that inequality is negatively associated with economic growth in a cross-country analysis.\nRobert Barro reexamined the reduced form relationship between inequality on economic growth in a panel of countries. He argues that there is \"little overall relation between income inequality and rates of growth and investment\". However, his empirical strategy limits its applicability to the understanding of the relationship between inequality and growth for several reasons. First, his regression analysis control for education, fertility, investment, and it therefore excludes, by construction, the important effect of inequality on growth via education, fertility, and investment. His findings simply imply that inequality has no direct effect on growth beyond the important indirect effects through the main channels proposed in the literature. Second, his study analyzes the effect of inequality on the average growth rate in the following 10 years. However, existing theories suggest that the effect of inequality will be observed much later, as is the case in human capital formation, for instance. Third, the empirical analysis does not account for biases that are generated by reverse causality and omitted variables.\nRecent papers based on superior data, find negative relationship between inequality and growth. Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry of the International Monetary Fund, find that \"lower net inequality is robustly correlated with faster and more durable growth, controlling for the level of redistribution\". Likewise, Dierk Herzer and Sebastian Vollmer find that increased income inequality reduces economic growth.\nEvidence: mechanisms.\nThe Galor and Zeira's model predicts that the effect of rising inequality on GDP per capita is negative in relatively rich countries but positive in poor countries. These testable predictions have been examined and confirmed empirically in recent studies. In particular, Br\u00fcckner and Lederman test the prediction of the model by in the panel of countries during the period 1970\u20132010, by considering the impact of the interaction between the level of income inequality and the initial level of GDP per capita. In line with the predictions of the model, they find that at the 25th percentile of initial income in the world sample, a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient increases income per capita by 2.3%, whereas at the 75th percentile of initial income a 1 percentage point increase in the Gini coefficient decreases income per capita by -5.3%. Moreover, the proposed human capital mechanism that mediates the effect of inequality on growth in the Galor-Zeira model is also confirmed. Increases in income inequality increase human capital in poor countries but reduce it in high and middle-income countries.\nThis recent support for the predictions of the Galor-Zeira model is in line with earlier findings. Roberto Perotti showed that in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, developed by Galor and Zeira, inequality is associated with lower level of human capital formation (education, experience, apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, while lower level of human capital is associated with lower levels of economic growth. Princeton economist Roland Benabou's finds that the growth process of Korea and the Philippines \"are broadly consistent with the credit-constrained human-capital accumulation hypothesis\". In addition, Andrew Berg and Jonathan Ostry suggest that inequality seems to affect growth through human capital accumulation and fertility channels.\nIn contrast, Perotti argues that the political economy mechanism is not supported empirically. Inequality is associated with lower redistribution, and lower redistribution (under-investment in education and infrastructure) is associated with lower economic growth.\nLong-term growth.\nLiving standards vary widely from country to country, and furthermore, the change in living standards over time varies widely from country to country. Below is a table which shows GDP per person and annualized per person GDP growth for a selection of countries over a period of about 100 years. The GDP per person data are adjusted for inflation, hence they are \"real\".\nSeemingly small differences in yearly GDP growth lead to large changes in GDP when compounded over time. For instance, in the above table, GDP per person in the United Kingdom in the year 1870 was $4,808. At the same time in the United States, GDP per person was $4,007, lower than the UK by about 20%. However, in 2008 the positions were reversed: GDP per person was $36,130 in the United Kingdom and $46,970 in the United States, i.e. GDP per person in the US was 30% more than it was in the UK. As the above table shows, this means that GDP per person grew, on average, by 1.80% per year in the US and by 1.47% in the UK. Thus, a difference in GDP growth by only a few tenths of a percent per year results in large differences in outcomes when the growth is persistent over a generation. This and other observations have led some economists to view GDP growth as the most important part of the field of macroeconomics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;...if we can learn about government policy options that have even small effects on long-term growth rates, we can contribute much more to improvements in standards of living than has been provided by the entire history of macroeconomic analysis of countercyclical policy and fine-tuning. Economic growth [is] the part of macroeconomics that really matters.\nImportance of long-run growth.\nOver long periods of time, even small rates of growth, such as a 2% annual increase, have large effects. For example, the United Kingdom experienced a 1.97% average annual increase in its inflation-adjusted GDP between 1830 and 2008. In 1830, the GDP was 41,373 million pounds. It grew to 1,330,088 million pounds by 2008. A growth rate that averaged 1.97% over 178 years resulted in a 32-fold increase in GDP by 2008.\nThe large impact of a relatively small growth rate over a long period of time is due to the power of exponential growth. The rule of 72, a mathematical result, states that if something grows at the rate of x% per year, then its level will double every 72/x years. For example, a growth rate of 2.5% per annum leads to a doubling of the GDP within 28.8 years, whilst a growth rate of 8% per year leads to a doubling of GDP within nine years. Thus, a small difference in economic growth rates between countries can result in very different standards of living for their populations if this small difference continues for many years.\nConsiderations.\nQuality of life.\nOne theory that relates economic growth with quality of life is the \"Threshold Hypothesis\", which states that economic growth up to a point brings with it an increase in quality of life. But at that point \u2013 called the threshold point \u2013 further economic growth can bring with it a deterioration in quality of life. This results in an upside-down-U-shaped curve, where the vertex of the curve represents the level of growth that should be targeted. Happiness has been shown to increase with GDP per capita, at least up to a level of $15,000 per person.\nEconomic growth has the indirect potential to alleviate poverty, as a result of a simultaneous increase in employment opportunities and increased labor productivity. A study by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) of 24 countries that experienced growth found that in 18 cases, poverty was alleviated.\nIn some instances, quality of life factors such as healthcare outcomes and educational attainment, as well as social and political liberties, do not improve as economic growth occurs.\nProductivity increases do not always lead to increased wages, as can be seen in the United States, where the gap between productivity and wages has been rising since the 1980s.\nEquitable growth.\nWhile acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development, poverty reduction and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth. The effect of economic growth on poverty reduction \u2013 the growth elasticity of poverty \u2013 can depend on the existing level of inequality. For instance, with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2% per head and 40% of its population living in poverty, can halve poverty in ten years, but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction. In the words of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon: \"While economic growth is necessary, it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Environmental impact.\nCritics such as the Club of Rome argue that a narrow view of economic growth, combined with globalization, is creating a scenario where we could see a systemic collapse of our planet's natural resources.\nConcerns about negative environmental effects of growth have prompted some people to advocate lower levels of growth, or the abandoning of growth altogether. In academia, concepts like uneconomic growth, steady-state economy, eco-taxes, green investments, basic income guarantees, along with more radical approaches associated with degrowth, commoning, eco-socialism and eco-anarchism have been developed in order to achieve this and to overcome possible growth imperatives. In politics, green parties embrace the Global Greens Charter, recognising that \"... the dogma of economic growth at any cost and the excessive and wasteful use of natural resources without considering Earth's carrying capacity, are causing extreme deterioration in the environment and a massive extinction of species.\"\nThe 2019 \"Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services\" published by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services warned that given the substantial loss of biodiversity, society should not focus solely on economic growth. Anthropologist Eduardo S. Brondizio, one of the co-chairs of the report, said \"We need to change our narratives. Both our individual narratives that associate wasteful consumption with quality of life and with status, and the narratives of the economic systems that still consider that environmental degradation and social inequality are inevitable outcomes of economic growth. Economic growth is a means and not an end. We need to look for the quality of life of the planet.\" \nThose more optimistic about the environmental impacts of growth believe that, though localized environmental effects may occur, large-scale ecological effects are minor. The argument, as posited by commentator Julian Lincoln Simon, stated in 1981 that if these global-scale ecological effects exist, human ingenuity will find ways to adapt to them. Conversely Partha Dasgupta, in a 2021 report on the economics of biodiversity commissioned by the British Treasury, argued that biodiversity is collapsing faster than at any time in human history as a result of the demands of contemporary human civilization, which \"far exceed nature's capacity to supply us with the goods and services we all rely on. We would require 1.6 Earths to maintain the world's current living standards.\" He says that major transformative changes will be needed \"akin to, or even greater than, those of the Marshall Plan,\" including abandoning GDP as a measure of economic success and societal progress. Philip Cafaro, professor of philosophy at the School of Global Environmental Sustainability at Colorado State University, wrote in 2022 that a scientific consensus has emerged which demonstrates that humanity is on the precipice of unleashing a major extinction event, and that \"the cause of global biodiversity loss is clear: other species are being displaced by a rapidly growing human economy.\"\nIn 2019, a warning on climate change signed by 11,000 scientists from over 150 nations said economic growth is the driving force behind the \"excessive extraction of materials and overexploitation of ecosystems\" and that this \"must be quickly curtailed to maintain long-term sustainability of the biosphere.\" They add that \"our goals need to shift from GDP growth and the pursuit of affluence toward sustaining ecosystems and improving human well-being by prioritizing basic needs and reducing inequality.\" A 2021 paper authored by top scientists in \"Frontiers in Conservation Science\" posited that given the environmental crises including biodiversity loss and climate change, and possible \"ghastly future\" facing humanity, there must be \"fundamental changes to global capitalism,\" including the \"abolition of perpetual economic growth.\"\nGlobal warming.\nUp to the present, there is a close correlation between economic growth and the rate of carbon dioxide emissions across nations, although there is also a considerable divergence in carbon intensity (carbon emissions per GDP). Up to the present, there is also a direct relation between global economic wealth and the rate of global emissions. The Stern Review notes that the prediction that, \"Under business as usual, global emissions will be sufficient to propel greenhouse gas concentrations to over 550 ppm CO2 by 2050 and over 650\u2013700 ppm by the end of this century is robust to a wide range of changes in model assumptions.\" The scientific consensus is that planetary ecosystem functioning without incurring dangerous risks requires stabilization at 450\u2013550 ppm.\nAs a consequence, growth-oriented environmental economists propose government intervention into switching sources of energy production, favouring wind, solar, hydroelectric, and nuclear. This would largely confine use of fossil fuels to either domestic cooking needs (such as for kerosene burners) or where carbon capture and storage technology can be cost-effective and reliable. The Stern Review, published by the United Kingdom Government in 2006, concluded that an investment of 1% of GDP (later changed to 2%) would be sufficient to avoid the worst effects of climate change, and that failure to do so could risk climate-related costs equal to 20% of GDP. Because carbon capture and storage are as yet widely unproven, and its long term effectiveness (such as in containing carbon dioxide 'leaks') unknown, and because of current costs of alternative fuels, these policy responses largely rest on faith of technological change.\nBritish conservative politician and journalist Nigel Lawson has deemed carbon emission trading an 'inefficient system of rationing'. Instead, he favours carbon taxes to make full use of the efficiency of the market. However, in order to avoid the migration of energy-intensive industries, the whole world should impose such a tax, not just Britain, Lawson pointed out. There is no point in taking the lead if nobody follows suit.\nResource constraint.\nMany earlier predictions of resource depletion, such as Thomas Malthus' 1798 predictions about approaching famines in Europe, \"The Population Bomb\", and the Simon\u2013Ehrlich wager (1980) have not materialized. Diminished production of most resources has not occurred so far, one reason being that advancements in technology and science have allowed some previously unavailable resources to be produced. In some cases, substitution of more abundant materials, such as plastics for cast metals, lowered growth of usage for some metals. In the case of the limited resource of land, famine was relieved firstly by the revolution in transportation caused by railroads and steam ships, and later by the Green Revolution and chemical fertilizers, especially the Haber process for ammonia synthesis.\nResource quality is composed of a variety of factors including ore grades, location, altitude above or below sea level, proximity to railroads, highways, water supply and climate. These factors affect the capital and operating cost of extracting resources. In the case of minerals, lower grades of mineral resources are being extracted, requiring higher inputs of capital and energy for both extraction and processing. Copper ore grades have declined significantly over the last century. Another example is natural gas from shale and other low permeability rock, whose extraction requires much higher inputs of energy, capital, and materials than conventional gas in previous decades. Offshore oil and gas have exponentially increased cost as water depth increases.\nSome physical scientists like Sanyam Mittal regard continuous economic growth as unsustainable. Several factors may constrain economic growth \u2013 for example: finite, peaked, or depleted resources.\nIn 1972, \"The Limits to Growth\" study modeled limitations to infinite growth; originally ridiculed, some of the predicted trends have materialized, raising concerns of an impending collapse or decline due to resource constraints.\n\"Malthusians\" such as William R. Catton, Jr. are skeptical of technological advances that improve resource availability. Such advances and increases in efficiency, they suggest, merely accelerate the drawing down of finite resources. Catton claims that increasing rates of resource extraction are \"...stealing ravenously from the future\".\nEnergy.\nEnergy economic theories hold that rates of energy consumption and energy efficiency are linked causally to economic growth. The Garrett Relation holds that there has been a fixed relationship between current rates of global energy consumption and the historical accumulation of world GDP, independent of the year considered. It follows that economic growth, as represented by GDP growth, requires higher rates of energy consumption growth. Seemingly paradoxically, these are sustained through increases in energy efficiency. Increases in energy efficiency were a portion of the increase in Total factor productivity. Some of the most technologically important innovations in history involved increases in energy efficiency. These include the great improvements in efficiency of conversion of heat to work, the reuse of heat, the reduction in friction and the transmission of power, especially through electrification. There is a strong correlation between per capita electricity consumption and economic development.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He had also served in the Roman army, fighting in Africa during the Third Punic War and in Spain during the Numantine War. \nHis political future was imperilled during his quaestorship when he was forced to negotiate a humiliating treaty with the Numantines after they had surrounded the army he was part of in Spain. Seeking to rebuild that future and reacting to a supposed decline in the Roman population which he blamed on rich families buying up Italian land, he carried a land reform bill against strong opposition by another tribune during his term as tribune of the plebs in 133\u00a0BC. To pass and protect his reforms, Tiberius unprecedentedly had the tribune who opposed his programme deposed from office, usurped the senate's prerogatives over foreign policy, and attempted to stand for a consecutive tribunate. Fears of Tiberius' popularity and his willingness to break political norms led to his death, along with many supporters, in a riot instigated by his enemies.\nHis land reforms survived his death; family allies, including his younger brother Gaius, took places on the land commission set up by the law and distributed over of land over the next few years. A decade later, Gaius too was plebeian tribune and proposed in his year much more wide-ranging reforms that also led to his death. Tiberius and his brother Gaius are known collectively as the Gracchi brothers. The date of Tiberius' death marks the traditional start of the Roman Republic's decline and eventual collapse.\nEarly life.\nTiberius Sempronius Gracchus was born in 163 or 162\u00a0BC. He was, from birth, a member of the Roman Republic's aristocracy.\nHis homonymous father was part of one of Rome's leading families. He served as consul for 177 and 163\u00a0BC, and was elected censor in 169. He also had celebrated two triumphs during the 170s, one for the victorious establishment of a twenty-year-long peace in Spain. His mother, Cornelia, was the daughter of the renowned general Scipio Africanus. His sister Sempronia was the wife of Scipio Aemilianus, another important general and politician. Tiberius was brought up by his mother, who dedicated herself after the elder Tiberius' death to her children's education.\nMilitary career.\nTiberius began his military career in 147\u00a0BC, serving as a legate or military tribune under his brother-in-law, Scipio Aemilianus during his campaign to take Carthage during the Third Punic War. According to Plutarch, Tiberius \u2013 along with Gaius Fannius \u2013 was among the first to scale Carthage's walls. He served through to the next year. Some time in his youth, perhaps before his Numantine campaign, he was co-opted into the augural college.\nIn 137\u00a0BC he was quaestor to consul Gaius Hostilius Mancinus and served his term in Hispania Citerior (nearer Spain) during the Numantine War. The campaign was unsuccessful; Mancinus and his army lost several skirmishes outside the city before a confused retreat in the night led to the army being surrounded. Mancinus then sent Tiberius to negotiate a treaty of surrender.\nThe Numantines had previously signed a treaty with Rome a few years earlier under Quintus Pompeius, but Rome had reneged on its terms; the senate refused to ratify the treaty on the grounds that its terms were too favourable to the Numantines. Tiberius' negotiations were successful in part because of the influence with the Numantines he inherited from his father's praetorship in the area in 179\u201378\u00a0BC. During the negotiations, Tiberius requested the return of his quaestorian account books which were taken when the Numantines had captured the Roman camp; the Numantines acquiesced. \nThe new treaty brought back in defeat was also rejected: the Romans rejected the terms as humiliating, revoked Mancinus' citizenship, and sent him stripped and bound to the Numantines. However, by the time the terms of this agreement were being debated in the senate, Numantine ambassadors had also arrived and Mancinus likely argued in favour of his own ritual surrender, felt confident in his safety, and wanted to look towards making a soft landing for his career. Tiberius offered no forceful support for the treaty and seems to have distanced himself from it; it was proposed to send Tiberius in chains along with Mancinus, but that proposal was defeated.\nTribunate.\nTiberius was elected as plebeian tribune for 133\u00a0BC. While Livy's depiction of the domestically placid middle republic is an overstatement, the political culture in Rome at this time still was able to find solutions through negotiation, peer pressure, and deference to superiors.\nThere was substantial demand among the poor for land redistribution; Tiberius enjoyed unprecedented levels of popularity in bringing the matter before the assemblies. Tiberius' unwillingness to stand aside or compromise broke with political norms. A similar land reform proposal by Gaius Laelius Sapiens during his consulship in 140\u00a0BC was withdrawn after bitter opposition and its defeat in the senate. Tiberius' stubbornness, however, was motivated in part by his need to recover politically from the affair with the treaty.\nMoreover, victory on the matter of the would have, for Tiberius, won him considerable support among the people and buttressed his prospects for higher office. His refusals to compromise or withdraw his proposals led to suspicion among the elite that the bill was for his personal and familial political interests instead of his stated objectives. The complex motives of Tiberius and his ally and father-in-law Appius Claudius Pulcher were not limited to pro-natalist policymaking and its concomitant effects for army levies; they also may have calculated that land distributions would co-opt the loyalties of the soon-to-return Numantine war veterans. Passage would have served to balance against Aemilianus' political influence \u2013 he was the commander in the final campaign of the Numantine war \u2013 after his expected victory.\nRoman land in the second century.\nAt the time of Tiberius' tribunate in the late 130s\u00a0BC, there were a number of economic issues before the Roman people: wage labour was scarce due to a dearth of public building, grain prices were likely high due to the ongoing slave rebellion in Sicily, population growth meant there were more mouths to feed, and declining willingness to serve on long army campaigns had increased migration to the cities. Altogether, these trends reduced urban workers' incomes, driving them closer to subsistence. Most of the population remained outside the cities in the countryside but similar issues plagued the rural poor as well. The end of colonisation projects caused an oversupply of rural free labour, driving down wages.\nThe Roman state owned a large amount of public land (\"ager publicus\") acquired from conquest. The state, however, did not exploit this land heavily. While it was theoretically Roman property, Rome had allowed allies to work and enjoy it after its de jure seizure. In the traditional story, derived from Appian and Plutarch (two historians writing during the imperial period), the had been occupied by rich landowners operating large staffed largely by slaves, driving poor farmers into destitution between military service and competition with slave labour. This narrative is both incompatible with two republican censuses and the ancient necessity for productive lands to be close to market. Illegal occupation of the for commercial production was unlikely due to the 's inaccessibility by urban markets; if displacement consistent with the ancient sources happened, it likely occurred only in farmlands areas close to Rome. Slave-staffed estates, the driver for displacement in that narrative, also did not become common until the first century BC, after the .\nIt is more likely that the expanded population of Italy through the second century\u00a0BC had led to greater demands for land redistribution and pressure on food supplies. Due to partible inheritance, modest farms had become divided into plots too small to feed a family. This led to underemployment of farmers; close to Rome, where demand for land was high, those farmers sold their lands to richer men and engaged in wage labour, which was a major source of employment around harvest time. Some of those farmers also found wage work in the cities, such as jobs in public works, itinerant manual labour, and selling food; their material livelihoods declined, however, after 140\u00a0BC when a pause in monumental building projects caused wage rates to fall. \nAlternate occupations included the army, but by the late 130s\u00a0BC, army life was hard; the plunder of the early 2nd century's armies had ended and Rome was instead engaged in sanguinary and unprofitable wars in Hispania. There are many contemporaneous reports of endemic desertion, draft evasion, and poor morale. A recent census also recorded a fall in Rome's population and, therefore, the number of leviable citizens; modern archaeology, however, has shown that this apparent decline was illusory. Nobody at the time connected unwillingness to serve in Spain with evasion of conscription by avoiding censorial registration. The Romans eventually righted their census undercount in the census of 125/4\u00a0BC, which showed the population had actually increased.\nTiberius believed that a previous law \u2013 commonly identified by modern scholars as the Licinio-Sextian rogations of the early fourth century\u00a0BC \u2013 had limited the amount of public land that any person could hold to 500 jugera (approximately 120 hectares). This legal maximum on land holdings, if it actually existed, was largely ignored and many people possessed far more than the limit, including Marcus Octavius, also serving as tribune in that year, and Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, then pontifex maximus.\nThe accounts of Appian and Plutarch are largely based on Tiberius and his supporters' political rhetoric and argumentation. Modern scholars have argued that those arguments were tendentious and did not reflect contemporaneous conditions objectively. Source difficulties also emerge, inasmuch as some modern scholars also doubt whether the Gracchan narratives in Plutarch and Appian are based more on tragic dramas about their deaths rather than credible historical narratives.\nAccording to Plutarch, referencing a pamphlet attributed to Tiberius' brother Gaius, Tiberius developed his measures after being moved by the dearth of free Italians tilling the fields in Etruria on the march to the Numantine war. The poor, without land, became unavailable for military service and stopped reproducing, causing population decline. A quote from Tiberius Gracchus is preserved in Plutarch:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The wild beasts that roam over Italy... have every one of them a cave or lair to lurk in; but the men who fight and die for Italy enjoy the common air and light, indeed, but nothing else; houseless and homeless they wander about with their wives and children. And it is with lying lips that their [commanders] exhort the soldiers in their battles to defend sepulchres and shrines from the enemy; for not a man of them has an hereditary altar, not one of all these many Romans an ancestral tomb, but they fight and die to support others in wealth and luxury, and though they are styled masters of the world, they have not a single clod of earth that is their own.\nTo resolve what he identified as the problem, Tiberius proposed a to enforce a limit on the amount of public land that one person could hold; surplus land would then be transferred into the hands of poor Roman citizens. Benefitting the poor was not the only goal of his legislation: Tiberius also intended to reduce the level of inflammation in the city by moving the poor into the countryside while also endowing those people with the necessary land to meet army property qualifications and reverse apparent population decline.\nThis agrarian policy, focusing on people with agricultural skills, led to much of his support coming from the poor rural plebs rather than the plebs in the city. Thousands reportedly flooded in from the countryside to support Tiberius and his programme. Tiberius was not, however, alone in his views: he was supported by one of the consuls for the year (the jurist Publius Mucius Scaevola), his father-in-law Appius Claudius Pulcher (who had served as consul for 143\u00a0BC), Publius Licinius Crassus Mucianus (elected the next year), and other younger, junior senators.\nThe amount of land each beneficiary would have received is unknown. Thirty is often suggested. That amount, however, is greatly in excess of the regular amount of land distributed in colonisation programmes (only 10 ). There were also restrictions on alienation and possibly rents (a ). While these conditions place the private ownership of the distributed land into question, and therefore also question whether an owner could be registered in the census as owning that land. Later laws indicate that it was legally treated as private with tenure maintained given payment of the \"\". An unpaid would trigger reverter to the state, which would then be able to redistribute it again.\nThe law would also create a commission, staffed following elections, by Tiberius Gracchus, his brother Gaius Gracchus, and his father-in-law, Appius Claudius Pulcher, to survey land and determine which illegally occupied land was to be seized for redistribution.\nPassage of the \"lex agraria\".\nPeople possessing more than 500 of land opposed the law strongly. While previous laws had fined occupation in excess of the limit, those fines were rarely enforced and the land possession itself was not disturbed. This led them to invest into improvements to that land, with some protests that the land was part of wives' dowries or the site of family tombs. Tiberius Gracchus' law would seize the land explicitly, a novelty. According to Plutarch, Tiberius initially proposed compensation, but the compromise offer was withdrawn after opposition; his later proposal was to compensate by securing tenure over a cap of 500 (with an additional 250 for up to two sons).\nThe exact legislative history of the bill is disputed: Appian and Plutarch's accounts of the bill's passage differ considerably. At a broad level, the bill was proposed before the \"concilium plebis\"; Tiberius forwent the approval of the senate before a bill was to be introduced. In response, the senate secured one of his tribunician colleagues to veto the proceedings. Both versions agree on obstruction from Marcus Octavius, one of the other tribunes, and his deposition.\nIn Plutarch's account, Tiberius proposes a bill with various concessions, which is then vetoed by Marcus Octavius, one of the other tribunes. In response, he withdraws the bill and removes the concessions. This latter bill is the one debated heavily in the forum. Tiberius tries various tactics to induce Octavius to abandon his opposition: offering him a bribe and shutting down the Roman treasury, and thereby, most government business. When the Assembly eventually assembles to vote, a veto is presumed. They attempt to adjudicate the matter in the senate, to no avail, and the Assembly votes to depose Octavius from office when he maintains his veto. Following the deposition, Tiberius' freedmen drag Octavius from the Assembly and the Assembly passes the bill.\nIn Appian's account, however, there is only one bill: opposition from Octavius appears only at the final vote, leading to the dispute to be taken to the senate, and then Octavius' deposition followed by the bill's passage. Prior to the vote, Tiberius gives a number of speeches, in which Appian asserts that Tiberius passed the bill on behalf of all Italians.\nThe political dispute between Tiberius and Octavius lacked clear resolution because of the unwritten Roman constitution's flexibility. The system, which worked best when magistrates worked cooperatively, broke down when magistrates exploited the legal extent of their powers fully and contrary to existing norms. Both men, being tribunes, represented the plebs and their interests. Octavius insisted on maintaining his veto against his constituents; Tiberius' response was to unconstitutionally depose Octavius. Tiberius had extra-constitutionally bypassed the senate by bringing the without its consent; Octavius similarly extra-constitutionally attempted to obstruct the manifest will of the people by veto.\nOpposition and death.\nAfter passage of the bill, the senate allocated very little money for the commissioners, making it impossible for the commission to do its job when it needed to pay for surveyors, pack animals, and other expenses. After this meagre allotment, however, news arrived that Attalus III of Pergamum had died and that he had bequeathed his treasury and devised his kingdom to Rome. Tiberius proposed using the bequest to finance the land commission, which triggered a wave of opposition. The ancient sources disagree on what the bequest would be used for: Plutarch asserts it was to be used to buy tools for the farmers, Livy's epitome asserts it was to be used to purchase more land for redistribution in response to an apparent shortage. The latter is unlikely, as the process of surveying and distribution were incipient; it is also possible the money was to be used to finance the commission itself.\nAfter this proposal, Tiberius was attacked in the senate by Quintus Pompeius and accused of harbouring regal ambitions. One of the former consuls also brought a lawsuit against Tiberius arguing the deposition of Octavius violated magisterial collegiality and was a dangerous precedent which a sufficiently powerful tribune could exploit to bypass all checks on his power.\nTiberius' proposal usurped senatorial prerogatives over finance and foreign policy, breaking a major political norm. Senators also feared that Tiberius intended to appropriate Attalus' bequest to hand out money to his personal benefit. This was compounded by his attempt to stand for re-election, claiming that he needed to do so to prevent repeal of the agrarian law or possibly to escape prosecution for his deposition of Octavius. Attempts at such consecutive terms may have been illegal. The bid, however, certainly violated Roman constitutional norms: magistrates were immune while in office and continuous officeholding implied continual immunity. Some ancient historians also report that Tiberius, to smooth his bid for re-election, brought laws to create mixed juries of senators and but this likely emerges from confusion with his brother's law to that effect. The deadly opposition to Tiberius Gracchus' reforms focused more on his subsequent actions \u2013 interpreted by his contemporaries as indicative of a desire to essentially overthrow the republic and institute a popular tyranny \u2013 than on the reforms themselves.\nAt the electoral \"comitia\" counting the votes for the tribunes for 132\u00a0BC, Tiberius and his entourage seized the Capitoline hill where the voting was taking place to dictate the result. At a senate meeting on the tribunician elections, Tiberius' first cousin Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica Serapio, the pontifex maximus, attempted to induce consul Publius Mucius Scaevola use force and stop Tiberius' re-election. When Scaevola refused, Scipio Nasica shouted a formula for levying soldiers in an emergency \u2013 \"anyone who wants the community secure, follow me\" () \u2013 and led a mob to the with his toga drawn over his head. In doing so, he attempted to frame the killing as a religious rite () taken to free the state from an incipient tyrant. Tiberius and supporters did not fight back; killed with stones, wooden chairs and other blunt weapons, their bodies were thrown into the Tiber.\nAftermath of Tiberius' death.\nTiberius' agrarian law was not repealed. His position on the agrarian commission was filled; the commission's business continued over the next few years: its progress can be observed in recovered boundary stones stating the commissioners' names. Most of those boundary stones bear the names of Gaius Gracchus, Appius Claudius Pulcher, and Publius Licinius Crassus. An increase in the register of citizens in the next decade suggests a large number of land allotments. But that registration could also be related to greater willingness to register: registration brought the chance of getting land from the commission. It also could have been related to lowering of the property qualifications for census registration into the fifth class from four thousand to 1.5 thousand \"asses\".\nThe activities of the land commission started to slow after 129\u00a0BC. The senate pounced on complaints from Italian allies that the land commissioners were unfairly seizing land from Italians. Scipio Aemilianus, arguing on behalf of the Italians, convinced the state to move decisions on Italian land away from the land commissioners to the consuls; the consuls promptly did nothing, stalling the commission's ability to acquire new land to distribute. However, over the few years of the commission's most fruitful activities, the amount of land distributed was substantial: the Gracchan boundary stones are found all over southern Italy. They distributed some 1.3 million (or 3,268 square kilometres), accommodating somewhere between 70,000 and 130,000 settlers. Shortly after this intervention, Scipio died mysteriously, leading to unsubstantiated rumours that his wife (also Tiberius Gracchus' sister), Gaius Gracchus, or other combinations of Gracchan allies had murdered him. These charges are not believed by modern historians.\nSome Gracchan supporters were prosecuted in special courts established by the senate under the supervision of the consuls for 132\u00a0BC. The special court, however, was not some kind of political purge; it largely acted against politically unimportant people and non-citizens. Scipio Nasica, after being brought up on the charge of murdering Tiberius Gracchus, was sent on a convenient delegation to Pergamum, where he died the following year. The senate, in so doing, conveyed at least a tacit approval of Tiberius' murder.\nPersonal life.\nTiberius married Claudia, daughter of the Appius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 143\u00a0BC. Appius was a major opponent of the Scipios, a family with which Tiberius was related in his maternal line. The date of the marriage is uncertain; it could have been related to a plan to reconcile the two families. His marriage to Pulcher's daughter, however, did cement an intergenerational friendship between their two families.\nLegacy.\nTiberius' brother, Gaius Sempronius Gracchus, continued his career without incident until he too stood for the tribunate and proposed similarly radical legislation, before also being killed with now explicit approval of the senate. Part of Gaius' land programmes was to start establishing Roman colonies outside of Italy, which later became standard policy in consequence of the more general realisation that Italy was insufficiently large to fulfil popular demands for agricultural land.\nPersonally, the killing of Tiberius also caused a greater break between Scipio Aemilianus and his Claudian and Gracchan relatives, especially after Scipio Aemilianus approved of Tiberius' murder.\nPolitical impact.\nThe impact of Tiberius' murder started a cycle of increased aristocratic violence to suppress popular movements. By introducing violent repression, the senatorial oligarchy created norms making future repression more acceptable. Political disputes in the middle republic were not resolved by killing political opponents and purging them from the body politic; before this point domestic political strife basically never resulted in violent death. Roman republican law, when passing ostensibly capital sentences, permitted convicts to flee the city into permanent exile.\nHis death also suggested that the republic itself was temperamentally unsuited for producing the types of economic reforms wanted or hypothetically needed, as in Tiberius' framing, by the people. However, Tiberius' actions did not mark him as an enemy of the senate seeking to destroy its authority: he sought a traditional career in the senate and irresponsibly engaged in excessive popular indulgences to further his career. Yet, his aggressive political tactics also showed that the republic's norms and institutions were far weaker than expected, that a non-existential political issue such as distributing public land to help with army recruitment, could overwhelm the republican constitution.\nThe senate's continued pursuit of Tiberius Gracchus' supporters also entrenched polarisation in the Roman body politic, while at the same time endorsing private use of violence to enforce or suppress a group, even a majority, of fellow countrymen. While the framing of Tiberius Gracchus' murder in terms of religious ritual sets it aside from the explicitly political killings of Gaius Gracchus and Marcus Fulvius Flaccus that were authorised by the senate, the use of violence in of itself subverted the norms of consensual republican government.\nPeriodisation.\nThe death of Tiberius Gracchus in 133\u00a0BC has been viewed, both in the Roman period and in modern scholarship, as the start of a new period in which politics was polarised and political violence normalised.\nIn the ancient period, Cicero remarked as much in saying \"the death of Tiberius Gracchus, and, even before his death, the whole character of his tribunate, divided one people into two factions\". Modern historians such as Mary Beard, however, warn that Cicero's claim is \"rhetorical oversimplification [and that] the idea there had been a calm consensus at Rome between rich and poor until [133\u00a0BC] is at best a nostalgic fiction\".\nMore modern commentators also express similar views. For example, Andrew Lintott writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this way Sigonio has helped to create the standard modern periodisation, whereby the Conflict of the Orders ends in 287 and the decline of the Republic begins in 133, the intervening period displaying the constitution at its best.\nIn the second edition of \"The Cambridge Companion to the Roman Republic\", J\u00fcrgen von Ungern-Sternberg similarly writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It was Tiberius' assassination that made the year 133\u00a0BC a turning point in Roman history and the beginning of the crisis of the Roman Republic.\nImpact on the Italian allies.\nContrary to Appian's claims about how Tiberius acted to give Rome's Italian allies land, there are no seeming indications that Tiberius Gracchus' reforms helped them in any way. Moreover, it was the Italian allies who launched the fiercest opposition to the land reform programme; Tiberius Gracchus' supporters also are never Italians in Appian's account, but only rural plebeians. \nAfter Rome acquired its public lands via conquest, the Italians expected that their rights to use it continually were surety for their loyal conduct. While those who complained the most were likely rich over-occupiers, Appian also reports that the commission's work was rushed and inaccurate. Furthermore, the land given in exchange for land taken per the might have been of inferior quality, also stoking resentment.\nBy altering this implicit agreement, the loyalty of the Italian allies during the Punic Wars and other conflicts therefore had won nothing. In the end, Roman enforcement of its long-unexercised rights over the , stoking resentment and removing disincentives to rebellion, contributed to the Social War between Rome and its Italian allies. This interaction between the Italians and land reform also brought up later proposals, including those of Tiberius' younger brother, to trade the Italian aristocracy's occupied lands for Roman citizenship or rights.\nModern legacy.\nThe French revolutionary Fran\u00e7ois-No\u00ebl Babeuf took up the name \"Gracchus Babeuf\" in emulation of the then-contemporary view of the Roman brothers as revolutionaries who were misinterpreted as seeking limitations on private property. He also published a newspaper, (\"the tribune of the people\"). Modern perspectives see the comparison as unapt, as Babeuf intended abolish private land ownership entirely and overthrow the French republic, goals incompatible with Tiberius'.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAncient sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It maintains a scientific as well as a plant-growing staff, and publication is one of its major modes of expression.\nThis broad outline is then expanded:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The botanic garden may be an independent institution, a governmental operation, or affiliated to a college or university. If a department of an educational institution, it may be related to a teaching program. In any case, it exists for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands. It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.\nRole and functions.\nAll botanical gardens have their own special interests. In a paper on the role of botanical gardens, Ferdinand von Mueller (1825\u20131896), the director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne (1852\u20131873), stated, \"in all cases the objects [of a botanical garden] must be mainly scientific and predominantly instructive\". He detailed many of the objectives being pursued by the world's botanical gardens in the middle of the 19th century, when European gardens were at their height. Many of these are listed below to give a sense of the scope of botanical gardens' activities at that time, and the ways in which they differed from parks or what he called \"public pleasure gardens\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nBotanical gardens have always responded to the interests and values of the day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but they became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. Their focus has been on creating an awareness of the threat to the Earth's ecosystems from human populations and its consequent need for biological and physical resources. Botanical gardens provide an excellent medium for communication between the world of botanical science and the general public. Education programs can help the public develop greater environmental awareness by understanding the meaning and importance of ideas like conservation and sustainability.\nWorldwide network.\nWorldwide, there are now about 1800 botanical gardens and arboreta in about 150 countries (mostly in temperate regions) of which about 550 are in Europe (150 of which are in Russia), 200 in North America, and an increasing number in East Asia. These gardens attract about 300 million visitors a year.\nHistorically, botanical gardens exchanged plants through the publication of seed lists (called in the 18th century). This was a means of transferring both plants and information between botanical gardens. This system continues today, though with attention to the risks of genetic piracy and transmission of invasive species.\nThe International Association of Botanic Gardens was formed in 1954 as a worldwide organisation affiliated to the International Union of Biological Sciences. More recently, coordination has also been provided by Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI), which has the mission \"To mobilise botanic gardens and engage partners in securing plant diversity for the well-being of people and the planet\". \nRegional co-ordination is seen in the United States with the American Public Gardens Association (formerly the American Association of Botanic Gardens and Arboreta), while in Australasia there is the Botanic Gardens of Australia and New Zealand (BGANZ).\nHistory.\nThe history of botanical gardens is closely linked to the history of botany itself. The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were medicinal gardens, but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful, strange, new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands. In the 18th century, they became more educational in function, demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures. Then, in the 19th and 20th centuries, the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating aspects of both horticulture and botany.\nPrecursors.\nThe idea of \"scientific\" gardens used specifically for the study of plants dates back to antiquity. The origin of modern botanical gardens is generally traced to the appointment of botany professors to the medical faculties of universities in 16th-century Renaissance Italy, which entailed curating a medicinal garden. However, the objectives, content, and audience of today's botanic gardens more closely resembles that of the grandiose gardens of antiquity and the educational garden of Theophrastus in the Lyceum of ancient Athens.\nGrand gardens of ancient history.\nNear-eastern royal gardens set aside for economic use or display and containing at least some plants gained by special collecting trips or military campaigns abroad, are known from the second millennium BCE in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Crete, Mexico and China. In about 2800\u00a0BCE, the Chinese Emperor Shen Nung sent collectors to distant regions searching for plants with economic or medicinal value. It has also been suggested that the Spanish colonization of Mesoamerica influenced the history of the botanical garden as gardens in Tenochtitlan established by king Nezahualcoyotl, also gardens in Chalco (alt\u00e9petl) and elsewhere, greatly impressed the Spanish invaders, not only with their appearance, but also because the indigenous Aztecs employed many more medicinal plants than did the classical world of Europe.\nEarly medieval gardens in Islamic Spain resembled later botanic gardens, an example being the 11th-century Huerta del Rey garden of physician and author Ibn Wafid (999\u20131075 CE) in Toledo. This was taken over by garden chronicler Ibn Bassal (fl. 1085\u00a0CE) until the Christian conquest in 1085\u00a0CE. Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville, most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included Morocco, Persia, Sicily, and Egypt. The medical school of Montpellier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians, and by 1250\u00a0CE, it included a physic garden, but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593.\nPhysic gardens.\nBotanical gardens developed from physic gardens, whose main purpose was to cultivate herbs for medical use as well as research and experimentation. Such gardens have a long history. In Europe, for example, Aristotle (384\u00a0BCE \u2013 322\u00a0BCE) is said to have had a physic garden in the Lyceum at Athens, which was used for educational purposes and for the study of botany, and this was inherited, or possibly set up, by his pupil Theophrastus, the \"Father of Botany\". There is some debate among science historians whether this garden was ordered and scientific enough to be considered \"botanical\"; instead, they attribute the earliest known botanical garden in Europe to the botanist and pharmacologist Antonius Castor, mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the 1st century.\nThe forerunners of modern botanical gardens are generally regarded as being the medieval monastic physic gardens that originated after the decline of the Roman Empire at the time of Emperor Charlemagne (742\u2013789 CE). These contained a , a garden used mostly for vegetables, and another section set aside for specially labelled medicinal plants and this was called the or \u2014more generally known as a physic garden, and a or orchard. Such gardens were given impetus by Charlemagne's Capitulary de Villis, which listed 73 herbs to be used in the physic gardens of his dominions. Many of these had already been introduced to British gardens. Pope Nicholas V set aside part of the Vatican grounds in 1447, for a garden of medicinal plants that were used to promote the teaching of botany, and this was a forerunner to the University gardens at Padua and Pisa established in the 1540s. Certainly the founding of many early botanic gardens was instigated by members of the medical profession.\n16th- and 17th-century European gardens.\nIn the 17th century, botanical gardens began their contribution to a deeper scientific curiosity about plants. If a botanical garden is defined by its scientific or academic connection, then the first true botanical gardens were established with the revival of learning that occurred in the European Renaissance. These were secular gardens attached to universities and medical schools, used as resources for teaching and research. The superintendents of these gardens were often professors of botany with international reputations, a factor that probably contributed to the creation of botany as an independent discipline rather than a descriptive adjunct to medicine.\nOrigins in the Italian Renaissance.\nThe botanical gardens of Southern Europe were associated with university faculties of medicine and were founded in Italy at Orto botanico di Pisa (1544), Orto botanico di Padova (1545), Orto Botanico di Firenze (1545), Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Pavia (1558) and Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Bologna (1568). Here the physicians (known in English as apothecaries) delivered lectures on the Mediterranean \"simples\" or \"officinals\" that were being cultivated in the grounds. Student education was no doubt stimulated by the relatively recent advent of printing and the publication of the first herbals.\nNorthern Europe.\nThe tradition of these Italian gardens spread across Europe, including among the earliest gardens \nLeipzig Botanical Garden, Germany, 1543, the Botanical Garden of Valencia, Spain, 1567; \"Hortus Botanicus Leiden\", Netherlands, 1590; and \"Hortus Botanicus (Amsterdam)\", Netherlands, 1638), University of Oxford Botanic Garden, England, 1621; and Chelsea Physic Garden, England, 1673; Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, Scotland, 1670; \"Jardin des plantes de Montpellier\", France, 1593; and \"Jardin des Plantes\", Paris, 1635; University of Copenhagen Botanical Garden, Denmark, 1600; and Uppsala University, Sweden, 1655.\nBeginnings of botanical science.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the first plants were being imported to these major Western European gardens from Eastern Europe and nearby Asia (which provided many bulbs), and these found a place in the new gardens, where they could be conveniently studied by the plant experts of the day. For example, Asian introductions were described by Carolus Clusius (1526\u20131609), who was director, in turn, of the Botanical Garden of the University of Vienna and Hortus Botanicus Leiden. Many plants were being collected from the Near East, especially bulbous plants from Turkey. Clusius laid the foundations of Dutch tulip breeding and the bulb industry, and he helped create one of the earliest formal botanical gardens of Europe at Leyden where his detailed planting lists have made it possible to recreate this garden near its original site. The of Leyden in 1601 was a perfect square divided into quarters for the four continents, but by 1720, though, it was a rambling system of beds, struggling to contain the novelties rushing in, and it became better known as the . His \"Exoticorum libri decem\" (1605) is an important survey of exotic plants and animals that is still consulted today. \nIn the mid to late 17th century, the Paris Jardin des Plantes was a centre of interest with the greatest number of new introductions to attract the public. In England, the Chelsea Physic Garden was founded in 1673 as the \"Garden of the Society of Apothecaries\". The Chelsea garden had heated greenhouses, and in 1723 appointed Philip Miller (1691\u20131771) as head gardener. He had a wide influence on both botany and horticulture, as plants poured into it from around the world. The garden's golden age came in the 18th century, when it became the world's most richly stocked botanical garden. Its seed-exchange programme was established in 1682 and still continues today.\n18th century.\nGardens and orangeries.\nWith the increase in maritime trade, ever more plants were brought back to Europe as trophies from distant lands, and these were triumphantly displayed in the private estates of the wealthy, in commercial nurseries, and in the public botanical gardens. Heated conservatories called \"orangeries\" became a feature of many botanical gardens. \nThe Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew were founded in 1759, initially as part of the Royal Garden set aside as a physic garden. William Aiton (1741\u20131793), the first curator, was taught by garden chronicler Philip Miller of the Chelsea Physic Garden whose son Charles became first curator of the original Cambridge Botanic Garden (1762). In 1759, the \"Physick Garden\" was planted, and by 1767, it was claimed that \"the Exotick Garden is by far the richest in Europe\". Gardens such as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (1759) and , Tenerife (1788) and the Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico de Madrid (1755) were set up to cultivate new species returned from expeditions to the tropics; they also helped found new tropical botanical gardens. From the 1770s, following the example of the French and Spanish, amateur collectors were supplemented by official horticultural and botanical plant hunters. These botanical gardens were boosted by the flora being sent back to Europe from various European colonies around the globe.\nAt this time, British horticulturalists were importing many woody plants from Britain's colonies in North America, and the popularity of horticulture had increased enormously, encouraged by the horticultural and botanical collecting expeditions overseas fostered by the directorship of Sir William Jackson Hooker and his keen interest in economic botany. At the end of the 18th century, Kew, under the directorship of Sir Joseph Banks, enjoyed a golden age of plant hunting, sending out collectors to the South African Cape, Australia, Chile, China, Ceylon, Brazil, and elsewhere, and acting as \"the great botanical exchange house of the British Empire\". From its earliest days to the present, Kew has in many ways exemplified botanic garden ideals, and is respected worldwide for the published work of its scientists, the education of horticultural students, its public programmes, and the scientific underpinning of its horticulture.\nIn 1728, John Bartram founded Bartram's Garden in Philadelphia, one of the continent's first botanical gardens. The garden is now managed as a historical site that includes a few original and many modern specimens as well as extensive archives and restored historical farm buildings.\nPlant classification.\nThe large number of plants needing description were listed in garden catalogues; and from 1753 Carl Linnaeus established the system of binomial nomenclature which greatly facilitated the listing process. Names of plants were authenticated by dried plant specimens mounted on card (a or garden of dried plants) that were stored in buildings called herbaria, these taxonomic research institutions being frequently associated with the botanical gardens, many of which by then had \"order beds\" to display the classification systems being developed by botanists in the gardens' museums and herbaria. Botanical gardens became scientific collections, as botanists published their descriptions of the new exotic plants, and these were recorded for posterity in detail by superb botanical illustrations. Botanical gardens effectively dropped their medicinal function in favour of scientific and aesthetic priorities, and the term \"botanic garden\" came to be more closely associated with the herbarium, library (and later laboratories) housed there than with the living collections \u2013 on which little research was undertaken.\n19th century.\nThe late 18th and early 19th centuries were marked by the establishment of tropical botanical gardens as a tool of colonial expansion (for trade and commerce and, secondarily, science) mainly by the British and Dutch, in India, South-east Asia and the Caribbean. This was also the time of Sir Joseph Banks's botanical collections during Captain James Cook's circumnavigations of the planet and his explorations of Oceania, with plant introductions on a grand scale.\nTropical.\nThere are currently about 230 tropical botanical gardens, many of them in southern and south-eastern Asia. The first botanical garden founded in the tropics was the Pamplemousses Botanical Garden in Mauritius, established in 1735 to provide food for ships using the port, but later trialling and distributing many plants of economic importance. This was followed by the West Indies (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Botanic Gardens, 1764) and in 1786 by the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanical Garden in Calcutta, India founded during a period of prosperity when the city was a trading centre for the Dutch East India Company. Other gardens were constructed in Brazil (Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden, 1808), Sri Lanka (Botanic Gardens of Peradeniya, 1821 and on a site dating back to 1371), Indonesia (Bogor Botanical Gardens, 1817 and Kebun Raya Cibodas, 1852), and Singapore (Singapore Botanical Gardens, 1822). These had a profound effect on the economy of the countries, especially in relation to the foods and medicines introduced. The importation of rubber trees to the Singapore Botanic Garden initiated the important rubber industry of the Malay Peninsula. At this time also, teak and tea were introduced to India and breadfruit, pepper and starfruit to the Caribbean.\nIncluded in the charter of these gardens was the investigation of the local flora for its economic potential to both the colonists and the local people. Many crop plants were introduced by or through these gardens\u00a0\u2013 often in association with European botanical gardens such as Kew or Amsterdam\u00a0\u2013 and included cloves, tea, coffee, breadfruit, cinchona, sugar, cotton, palm oil and \"Theobroma cacao\" (for chocolate). During these times, the rubber plant was introduced to Singapore. Especially in the tropics, the larger gardens were frequently associated with a herbarium and museum of economy. The Botanical Garden of Peradeniya had considerable influence on the development of agriculture in Ceylon where the Para rubber tree () was introduced from Kew, which had itself imported the plant from South America. Other examples include cotton from the Chelsea Physic Garden to the Province of Georgia in 1732 and tea into India by Calcutta Botanic Garden. The transfer of germplasm between the temperate and tropical botanical gardens was undoubtedly responsible for the range of agricultural crops currently used in several regions of the tropics.\nTemperate.\nThe first botanical gardens in Australia were founded early in the 19th century. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, 1816; the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, 1818; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, 1845; Adelaide Botanic Gardens, 1854; and Brisbane Botanic Gardens, 1855. These were established essentially as colonial gardens of economic botany and acclimatisation.\nSouth Africa has 10 national-level botanical gardens, all overseen by the South African National Biodiversity Institute. The oldest in South Africa is the 1851 Durban Botanic Gardens. The Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden is the most famous and developed garden in the country, established in 1913, on a site dating to 1848. It covers 36 hectares, with an additional 528 hectares of mountainside wilderness forming part of the garden. Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden is South Africa's oldest university botanical garden; it was established in 1922. Also in the country is the Karoo Desert National Botanical Garden, founded in 1921 and relocated in 1945. Elsewhere in Africa, Orman Garden at Giza in Egypt was founded in 1875.\nPresidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, all experienced farmers, shared the dream of a national botanic garden, leading to the founding in 1820 of the United States Botanic Garden, next to the Capitol in Washington DC. In 1859, the Missouri Botanical Garden was founded at St Louis, Missouri; it is one of the world's leading gardens specializing in tropical plants. \nRussia's botanical gardens include founded by Tsar Peter the Great, and the Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden, (1714).\n20th century.\nCivic and municipal botanical gardens.\nA large number of civic or municipal botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens in the sense of building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. They tended to become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.\nCommunity engagement.\nThe second half of the 20th century saw increasingly sophisticated educational, visitor service, and interpretation services. Botanical gardens started to cater for many interests and their displays reflected this, often including botanical exhibits on themes of evolution, ecology or taxonomy, horticultural displays of attractive flowerbeds and herbaceous borders, plants from different parts of the world, special collections of plant groups such as bamboos or roses, and specialist glasshouse collections such as tropical plants, alpine plants, cacti and orchids, as well as the traditional herb gardens and medicinal plants. Specialised gardens like the Palmengarten in Frankfurt, Germany (1869), one of the world's leading orchid and succulent plant collections, have been very popular. With decreasing financial support from governments, revenue-raising public entertainment increased, including music, art exhibitions, special botanical exhibitions, theatre and film, this being supplemented by the advent of \"Friends\" organisations and the use of volunteer guides.\nPlant conservation.\nPlant conservation and the heritage value of exceptional historic landscapes were treated with a growing sense of urgency through the 20th century. Specialist gardens were sometimes given a separate or adjoining site, to display native and indigenous plants. In the 1970s, gardens became focused on plant conservation. The Botanic Gardens Conservation Secretariat was established by the IUCN and the World Conservation Union in 1987 with the aim of coordinating the plant conservation efforts of botanical gardens around the world. It maintains a database of rare and endangered species in botanical gardens' living collections. Many gardens hold \"ex situ\" conservation collections that preserve genetic variation. These may be held as seeds dried and stored at low temperature, or in tissue culture (such as the Kew Millennium Seedbank); as living plants, including those that are of special horticultural, historical or scientific interest (such as those in the National Plant Collection in the United Kingdom); or by managing and preserving areas of natural vegetation. Collections are often held and cultivated with the intention of reintroduction to their original habitats. \n21st century.\nNew gardens.\nBotanical gardens have continued to be built in the 21st century, such as the first botanical garden in Oman, which is planned to be one of the largest gardens in the world, with the first large-scale cloud forest in a huge glasshouse. Development of botanical gardens in China over recent years has been remarkable, including the Hainan Botanical Garden of Tropical Economic Plants at Guangzhou, South China Botanical Garden the Xishuangbanna Botanical Garden of Tropical Plants and the Xiamen Botanic Garden. In developed countries, on the other hand, many have closed for lack of financial support, especially those attached to universities. The Palestine Museum of Natural History has a botanic garden, which has been described as a site of nation-building and resistance by Silvia Hassouna.\nMissions and strategy.\nThe Center for Plant Conservation at St Louis, Missouri, coordinates the conservation of native North American species. The 2006 \"North American Botanic Garden Strategy for Plant Conservation\" sets out its goals to document and conserve plant diversity, to use that diversity sustainably, to educate the public about plant diversity, build conservation capacity, and to build support for the strategy itself.\nA 2024 review in a special issue of the \"Journal of Zoological and Botanical Gardens\" on the sustainability of botanic gardens noted their increasing roles in conservation and research, and the many new gardens created since 1950. In its view, the gardens are being \"reinvent[ed]\" to serve the goals of conservation, sustainability, and social engagement. It observes that historically, the gardens emerged in an era that saw both the growth of modern science and the colonial era. In response, the gardens have engaged in decolonising and in \"new socio-environmental missions\". Finally, it attempts to view the gardens on a global scale. \nA 2023 historical review by Chinese botanists similarly notes the long history of botanical gardens from the medicinal gardens of the first universities in Renaissance Europe, and from China's ancient Shennong herbal garden tradition. The gardens have in its view continuously adapted to new demands in a changing environment, coming to serve the \"core mission of \"ex situ\" conservation\".\nBotanical gardens must find a compromise between the need for peace and seclusion, while at the same time satisfying the public need for information and visitor services that include restaurants, information centres and sales areas that bring with them rubbish, noise, and hyperactivity. Attractive landscaping and planting design sometimes compete with scientific interests\u00a0\u2014 with science now often taking second place. Some gardens are now heritage landscapes that are subject to constant demand for new exhibits and exemplary environmental management.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps://"}

He played lead alto in the saxophone section for many years. Hodges was also featured on soprano saxophone, but refused to play soprano after 1940. Along with Benny Carter, Hodges is considered to be one of the definitive alto saxophone players of the big band era.\nAfter beginning his career as a teenager in Boston, Hodges began to travel to New York and played with Lloyd Scott, Sidney Bechet, Luckey Roberts and Chick Webb. When Ellington wanted to expand his band in 1928, Ellington's clarinet player Barney Bigard recommended Hodges. His playing became one of the identifying voices of the Ellington orchestra. From 1951 to 1955, Hodges left the Duke to lead his own band, but returned shortly before Ellington's triumphant return to prominence \u2013 the orchestra's performance at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nJohn Cornelius Hodges was born in the Cambridgeport neighborhood of Cambridge, Massachusetts, to John H. Hodges and Katie Swan Hodges, both originally from Virginia. After moving for a short period of time to North Cambridge, the family moved to Hammond Street in the South End of Boston, where he grew up with saxophonists Harry Carney (who would also become a long-term member of Duke Ellington\u2019s big band), Charlie Holmes and Howard E. Johnson. His first instruments were drums and piano. While his mother was a skilled piano player, Hodges was mostly self-taught.\nOnce he became good enough, he played the piano at dances in private homes for $8 an evening. He had taken up the soprano saxophone by his teens. It was around this time that Hodges developed the nickname \"Rabbit\", which some people believe arose from his ability to win 100-yard dashes and outrun truant officers, while others, including Carney, said he was called by that name because of his rabbit-like nibbling on lettuce and tomato sandwiches.\nWhen Hodges was 14, he went with his eldest sister to see Sidney Bechet play in Jimmy Cooper's \"Black and White Revue\" in a Boston burlesque hall. Hodges's eldest sister introduced him to Bechet, who asked him to play something on the soprano saxophone he had brought with him. Hodges played \"My Honey's Lovin' Arms\" for Bechet, who was impressed with his skill and encouraged him to keep on playing and would also give Hodges formal saxophone lessons. Hodges built a name for himself in the Boston area before moving to New York City in 1924.\nDuke Ellington.\nHodges joined Duke Ellington's orchestra in November 1928. He was one of the prominent Ellington Band members who featured in Benny Goodman's 1938 Carnegie Hall concert. Goodman described Hodges as \"by far the greatest man on alto sax that I ever heard.\" Charlie Parker called him \"the Lily Pons of his instrument.\" John Coltrane considered Hodges his first model on the saxophone, even calling him \u201cthe world's greatest saxophone player.\u201d\nEllington's practice of writing tunes specifically for members of his orchestra resulted in the Hodges specialties, \"Confab with Rab\", \"Jeep's Blues\", \"Sultry Sunset\", and \"Hodge Podge\". Other songs recorded by the Ellington Orchestra which prominently feature Hodges's smooth alto saxophone sound are \"Magenta Haze\", \"Prelude to a Kiss\", \"Haupe\" (from \"Anatomy of a Murder\") \u2013 also notable are the \"seductive\" and hip-swaying \"Flirtibird\", featuring the \"irresistibly salacious tremor\" by Hodges, \"The Star-Crossed Lovers\" from Ellington's \"Such Sweet Thunder\" suite, \"I Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)\", \"Blood Count\" and \"Passion Flower\".\nHe had a pure tone and economy of melody on both the blues and ballads that won him admiration from musicians of all eras and styles, from Ben Webster and John Coltrane, who both played with him when he had his own orchestra in the 1950s, to Lawrence Welk, who featured him in an album of standards. His highly individualistic playing style, which featured the use of a wide vibrato and much sliding between slurred notes, was frequently imitated. As evidenced by the Ellington compositions named after him, he earned the nicknames \"Jeep\" and \"Rabbit\" \u2013 according to Johnny Griffin because \"he looked like a rabbit, no expression on his face while he's playing all this beautiful music.\"\nSaxophones.\nIn the 1940s, Hodges played a Conn 6M (recognizable by its octave-key mechanism being on the underside of the neck) and later on a Buescher 400 (recognizable by its V-shaped bell-brace) alto saxophone. By the end of his career in the late 1960s, Hodges was playing a Vito LeBlanc Rationale alto (serial number 2551A), an instrument with unusual key-mechanisms (providing various alternative fingerings) and tone-hole placement, which gave superior intonation. Fewer than 2,000 were ever made. Hodges's Vito saxophone was silver-plated and extensively engraved on the bell, bow, body and key-cups of the instrument.\nDeath.\nHodges's last performances were at the Imperial Room in Toronto, less than a week before his May 11, 1970, death from a heart attack, suffered during a visit to the office of a dental surgeon. His last recordings are featured on the \"New Orleans Suite\", which was only half-finished when he died. He was married twice; he had a daughter by his first wife, Bertha Pettiford, and a son (John C. Hodges II) and a daughter (Lorna Lee) by his second wife, Edith Cue.\nThe loss of Hodges's sound prompted Ellington, upon learning of the musician's death from a heart attack, to lament to \"JET\" magazine: \"The band will never sound the same without Johnny.\" In Ellington's eulogy of Hodges, he said: \"Never the world's most highly animated showman or greatest stage personality, but a tone so beautiful it sometimes brought tears to the eyes\u2014this was Johnny Hodges. This \"is\" Johnny Hodges.\"\n\"Hodges was not a member of Ellington's Orchestra before 1928, or during 1951\u201355, or after May 11, 1970, when Hodges died. Duke Ellington's earliest recordings date from 1924 and he died on May 24, 1974. The two men's discographies thus match almost exactly, bar exceptions listed above and in this section.\"\nDiscography.\nAs sideman.\nwith Lawrence Brown\nwith Coleman Hawkins\nwith Joya Sherrill\nwith Billy Strayhorn\nwith Billy Taylor\nWith Clark Terry\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Two of these leagues were associated with organized baseball; the third and most recent incarnation was an independent league that operated for two seasons in 2002\u201303.\nHistory.\nClass D league (1910\u201312).\nAfter playing a season in 1897, the Southeastern League reformed and lasted for three years, from 1910 through 1912. At Class D, it was considered on the lowest rung of the minor league ladder, and had six clubs located in the American states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina and Tennessee. Stung by the midseason collapse of two of its six franchises, this league disbanded on August 2, 1912.\nClass B league (1926\u201350).\nIn 1926 a new, Class B Southeastern League took the field, with six teams \u2014 representing Montgomery, Alabama; Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Florida; and Albany, Columbus and Savannah, Georgia. Although this league would be periodically shut down by the Great Depression and World War II, it continued as a Class B circuit, four levels below Major League Baseball, through 1950.\nIts lineup of teams in its final season included the champion Pensacola Fliers, Meridian Millers, Montgomery Rebels, Jackson Senators, Vicksburg Billies, Selma Cloverleafs, Gadsden Pilots and Anniston Rams. Both Gadsden and Anniston withdrew from the league before the end of the season.\nIndependent league (2002\u201303).\nThe most recent version of the Southeastern League was an independent circuit, with member teams were not affiliated with any Major League Baseball team.\nThe league began play in 2002 after the demise of the All-American Association. For its inaugural season, it placed teams in Montgomery, Ozark, and Selma, Alabama, along with Pensacola, Florida, Americus, Georgia, and Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The Ozark Patriots and Americus Arrows franchises folded at mid-season. The Pensacola Pelicans won the inaugural league championship.\nAfter completing the season, the league added two franchises for 2003. The league had high hopes for its new team in Macon, Georgia, and Houma, Louisiana, along with the already successful clubs in Montgomery and Pensacola. However, after just two games the Selma Cloverleafs folded, forcing the league to operate the club as a road team for the duration of the season under the name \"Southeastern Cloverleafs.\" The Macon Peaches also fared a lot worse than expected. Still, the league completed the year, with Pensacola compiling the league's best mark at 42-23 and Baton Rouge defeating Pensacola, 3 games to 1, in the league championship series.\nUltimately, the league could not survive the arrival of affiliated baseball to Montgomery. The Orlando Rays of the Southern League, who had played at Walt Disney World for four years, became the Montgomery Biscuits and effectively drove the Wings out of town. In addition, the Springfield/Ozark Mountain Ducks of the Central Baseball League moved to Pensacola and assumed the Pelicans name. As a result, the league folded prior to the 2004 season.\nCities represented.\n1910-1950.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nStandings &amp; statistics.\nYear 1897.\n1897 Southeastern League\nColumbus disbanded April 29; Asheville entered the league May 6\nYears 1910-1912.\n1910 Southeastern League\n1911 Southeastern League\n1912 Southeastern League\nHuntsville (24-29) moved to Talladega July 9; Bessemer disbanded July 14; Anniston disbanded July 19 \nSecond half started July 22.

Its first team competes in League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. Nicknamed 'The Railwaymen' because of the town's links with the rail industry, and also commonly known as 'The Alex', they have played at their current Gresty Road location (adjacent to the sites of two previous grounds) since 1906. The supporters' fiercest rivalry is with Staffordshire-based side Port Vale.\nThe club was formed in August 1877 as the football division of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club, named after Princess Alexandra. Crewe reached the FA Cup semi-finals in 1888 and were then a founding member of the Football League Second Division in 1892. In 1921, the club was invited to join the newly created Football League Third Division North, where they stayed for the next 37 years before being placed in the new Fourth Division in 1958. The team achieved their first promotion after finishing third in 1962\u201363. Crewe were immediately relegated the next season but were promoted again in 1967\u201368, but again lasted just one season in the Third Division.\nCrewe spent 20 years struggling in the fourth tier before their fortunes were revived under Dario Gradi, manager for 24 years from 1983. Under his leadership, Crewe were twice promoted to the third tier from the fourth, and, in 1997, won the Second Division play-off final to secure a place in the Football League First Division. After an absence of 101 years, they played at this second tier level\u2015renamed the Championship before the start of the 2004\u201305 season\u2015for eight of the following nine seasons. Gradi encouraged Crewe to play attractive, technical football and built a reputation for developing young players, with future England internationals David Platt, Danny Murphy, Seth Johnson and Dean Ashton all emerging at the club. After Crewe dropped down to the fourth tier again in 2009, Steve Davis led the club to promotion to the third tier via the play-offs in 2012. In 2013, the club won its first and only Football League Trophy. Under David Artell, manager from January 2017, Crewe returned to third tier League One in 2020 and finished 12th in the 2020\u201321 season, but were relegated in 2022.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years.\nCrewe Alexandra Football Club was formed in August 1877 as an offshoot of Crewe Alexandra Cricket Club (established in September 1866 by Thomas Abraham and other workers at Crewe locomotive works), and named after Alexandra, Princess of Wales. They were based at the Alexandra Recreation Ground in Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, and played their first match against a side from Basford in North Staffordshire on 1 December 1877, drawing 1\u20131. In 1883, Crewe Alexandra's first match in the FA Cup was against Scottish club Queen's Park of Glasgow, losing 10\u20130. In February 1886, William Bell became the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham. In 1887\u201388, the club reached the FA Cup semi-finals, defeating Swifts, Derby County and Middlesbrough en route, before going out to Preston North End. In 1891, the football club split away from the cricket club\u2014a step that was condemned by Francis Webb, chief engineer of the town's London and North Western Railway (LNWR) Crewe works, who was virulently opposed to professionalism in sport; following the schism, Webb and the LNWR said the company would \"refuse to find employment in the Crewe Works for any professional football player\". Consequently, \"the football section of the Alexandra Club owed little to the LNWR..., despite the teams being closely linked to the local railway industry\" (though one of Webb's successors as LNWR's chief engineer, Charles Bowen Cooke, was \"less intractable\" and \"was President of Crewe Alexandra Football Club and the professional athletics meetings it organised\").\nOn 5 March 1892, John Pearson became the first Crewe player to win an England cap, playing against Ireland in Belfast; he remains the only Crewe player capped for the full England side while playing for the club.\nCrewe secretary J.G. Hall helped found the unsuccessful Combination (launched at Crewe's Royal Hotel in early 1889) and then the Football Alliance (1889\u20131892). When the latter merged with the Football League, Crewe were a founding member of the Football League Second Division in 1892, but lost their league status in 1896 after only four seasons\u2014finishing third from bottom, fourth from bottom, then bottom twice\u2014possibly due to a player budget that was a quarter of that of other clubs. The club left the Alexandra Recreation Ground shortly before the end of the 1895\u201396 season, and after playing at a number of different venues, including in nearby Sandbach, they moved to the first Gresty Road ground in 1897 (in 1906, the club's current ground adjacent to Gresty Road was constructed to the west of its previous site). Incorporated as a limited company on 29 May 1899, Crewe spent two further seasons in the second incarnation of the Combination from 1896 followed by three seasons in the Lancashire League, before competing in the Birmingham &amp; District League for ten years. They also won the Cheshire Senior Challenge Cup in 1907 and 1910. The team spent the 1910s in the Central League, finishing second in 1913\u201314 and 1920\u201321.\nCrewe rejoined the Football League in 1921; they finished 6th in their first two seasons in the Third Division North but did not finish as high again until 1931\u201332 and 1935\u201336. In October 1932, defender Fred Keenor's last Wales appearance marked Crewe's first international cap of the 20th century. Crewe's first major honours were Welsh Cup wins in 1936 and 1937; Crewe is not in Wales but English clubs, usually from border areas, participated by invitation. In 1936, Bert Swindells scored his 100th League goal for Crewe, going on to score 128 League goals for the club, a record that still stands, as well as goals in both Welsh Cup finals.\nPost-World War II.\nFrom the 1950s to the early 1980s, Crewe enjoyed only occasional success. Looking over Gresty Road, Michael Palin, in the 1980 BBC \"Great Railway Journeys of the World\" series, described Crewe as \"like those other railway towns, Swindon and Doncaster, possessed of a football team which is perpetually propping up the bottom of the Fourth Division\". Between 1894 and 1982, Crewe finished last in the Football League eight times, more than any other league club. On 25 December 1954, Crewe embarked on a sequence where they did not win away from home for 56 matches; the run ended with a 1\u20130 win at Southport on 24 April 1957. Crewe finished bottom of Division Three North three times in a row from 1955\u201356 to 1957\u201358, tallying just 28, 21 and 23 points from 46 games in each respective season. The club was placed into the newly formed Fourth Division in 1958\u201359.\nAll-time records were set against First Division Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup fourth round in 1960. A new record Gresty Road attendance of 20,000 saw Crewe hold Spurs to a 2\u20132 draw on 30 January. On 3 February, Tottenham convincingly won the replay 13\u20132, Crewe's record defeat. The following year, however, Jimmy McGuigan's Crewe side defeated another First Division club, Chelsea, 2\u20131 in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge on 7 January 1961. Chelsea's side included former Crewe player Frank Blunstone\u2014who scored Chelsea's goal\u2014as well as England internationals Peter Bonetti, Jimmy Greaves and Terry Venables. Crewe were then again drawn against the eventual double-winning Spurs side, who won 5\u20131 in the fourth round at White Hart Lane.\n1960s promotions and relegations.\nIn 1963, Crewe secured their first promotion to the Third Division, winning the season's final game against Exeter City, with Frank Lord scoring the only goal in front of a crowd of 9,807 at Gresty Road. Lord holds the record for most hat-tricks for the club with eight, and he scored a then record 33 goals that season, forming a strong partnership with Johnny King (17 goals). The club finished in third place, behind champions Brentford and Oldham Athletic, but were relegated back to Division Four the following season. In the 1964\u201365 season, Terry Harkin set a new record of 34 league goals for Crewe. Managed by Ernie Tagg, the club achieved promotion for a second time in 1967\u201368, but again spent just one season in the Third Division.\n1970s and early 1980s.\nFrom 1969, Crewe spent 20 years in Division Four, finishing bottom in 1971\u201372, 1978\u201379 and 1981\u201382, and not achieving a top half finish until 1985. In 1974, they came within two minutes of taking Aston Villa into extra time in a League Cup third round replay at Villa Park. In 1977, Tommy Lowry played his record-setting 475th and last game for the Railwaymen; he had earlier passed Peter Leigh's total of 430 appearances between 1960 and 1972. From February to September 1979, the club went a record 16 matches (15 league, one League Cup tie) without winning at Gresty Road. In December 1979, manager Tony Waddington signed the goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar who kept eight clean-sheets in his 24 matches played, and, on 5 May 1980, scored a penalty\u2014his only professional goal\u2014to seal a 2\u20130 victory over York City.\nGradi years (1983\u20132011).\nIn June 1983, after Crewe finished second from bottom at the end of the 1982\u201383 season, the club chairman Norman Rowlinson appointed Milan-born Dario Gradi as manager. Gradi looked to build an academy structure to develop players that could be sold to help fund the player development programme. Among his early transfer successes were Geoff Thomas and John Pemberton (both signed from Rochdale and sold to Crystal Palace, in 1987 and 1988 respectively), and former Manchester United apprentice David Platt, signed in 1985 and sold to Aston Villa for \u00a3200,000 in February 1988.\nUnder Gradi, and despite some Crewe fans' initial reservations, Crewe played attractive, technical football and gained a reputation for developing young talent. Steve Walters became Crewe's youngest player, aged just 16 years and 119 days when he played against Peterborough United on 7 May 1988. In 1989, Crewe won their third promotion, a 1\u20131 draw at Tranmere Rovers enough to take both teams into the Third Division. Meanwhile, on 7 January 1989, Crewe had hosted Aston Villa\u2014and Platt\u2014at Gresty Road in the FA Cup third round, taking a 2\u20130 lead before the visitors rallied to secure a 3\u20132 win, with Platt netting the winner but refusing to celebrate against his former club. A year later, on 6 January 1990, Crewe were drawn away at Chelsea in the third round; Walters gave Crewe a first-half lead at Stamford Bridge before Chelsea equalised in the 82nd minute to force a replay, which they won 2\u20130. In March 1990, Crewe defender Paul Edwards was sold to Coventry City for \u00a3350,000; he was later named in the 1989-1990 Third Division PFA Team of the Year, Crewe's first player to feature in the awards.\nCrewe were relegated in 1991. However, despite further player sales\u2015defender Rob Jones joined Liverpool for \u00a3300,000, then Craig Hignett was sold for a club record \u00a3500,000 to Middlesbrough\u2015the club reached the 1993 Third Division play-off final but lost against York City at Wembley. Crewe then gained promotion in 1994 after a final day victory at Chester City. In the same year, Neil Lennon became the first Crewe player to win an international cap since Fred Keenor in 1932 when he was selected to play for Northern Ireland against Mexico. Crewe twice lost in play-off semi-finals, to Bristol Rovers in 1995 and Notts County in 1996, then returned to Wembley in the 1997 Division Two play-off final, securing a 1\u20130 victory over Brentford to put the club back in the second tier for the first time since 1896.\nSecond tier survival.\nCrewe achieved their highest finishing position, 11th, in the 1997\u201398 First Division season. Gradi kept his team in the division until 2002, despite a matchday income on which many more lowly clubs could not survive. Boosting the finances, notable player sales included Lennon (to Leicester City for \u00a3750,000), Danny Murphy (to Liverpool for an initial fee of \u00a31.5m), and Seth Johnson (to Derby County for \u00a33m). Gradi celebrated his 1,000th game in charge of Crewe on 20 November 2001.\nAfter one season in the Division Two the team were promoted back to Division One at the end of the 2002\u201303 season, having finished in second place\u2014Crewe's first runner-up position\u2014with Rob Hulse scoring 22 league goals, and being named in the PFA Team of the Year, ahead of a \u00a3750,000 transfer to West Bromwich Albion. Crewe retained their Division One place in the 2003\u201304 season, during which assistant manager Neil Baker took temporary charge between 22 September and 17 October 2003 while Gradi underwent heart surgery. At the start of the 2004\u201305 season, Crewe were rated one of the teams most likely to be relegated from the newly renamed 'Championship'. In the event, they put in a good showing in the first half of the season, but after selling Dean Ashton to Norwich City for \u00a33 million in the January 2005 transfer window, Crewe failed to win until the final match of the season, when they defeated Coventry City 2\u20131 to avoid relegation on goal difference. However, they were relegated to League One (level three) the following season. Nonetheless, Crewe were named the \"Most Admired Club\" in the 2006 Football League Awards.\nStepping back.\nBy the summer of 2007, Gradi was the longest-serving manager in English league football, having completed 24 years in sole charge of the club. Crewe announced that, from 1 July 2007, Gradi would take up a new role as the club's technical director while gradually allowing newly appointed first-team coach Steve Holland control of the team. Holland's first season was a disappointment as the club narrowly avoided relegation, finishing 20th with 50 points. Ahead of his second season, he spent half a million pounds on new signings, while striker Nicky Maynard joined Bristol City for \u00a32.25 million. However, despite a positive pre-season, Crewe took only nine points from their first 16 games. The board sacked Holland as first team coach in November 2008, and re-appointed Gradi as caretaker manager.\nOn 24 December 2008, former Stoke City manager Gudjon Thordarson was appointed as Holland's successor. He made a promising start, and received the February 2009 Manager of the Month award (the first Crewe manager to win the award), but the team suffered a poor end-of-season run, not winning for 10 games, and were relegated to League Two. On 2 October 2009, after nine months in charge and another poor run of results, Thordarson was sacked, and Gradi was reinstated as caretaker manager. Despite lingering close to the playoff places for the majority of the season, another run of poor form saw the club finish 18th. Crewe improved to 10th in the 2010\u201311 season, during which Gradi won the January 2011 Manager of the Month. In November 2011, Gradi finally stepped down as manager and returned to his previous role as director of football focusing on youth development.\n2011 to present day.\nSteve Davis was appointed manager in the same month. Previously manager of nearby Nantwich Town, Davis had been appointed assistant manager in June 2009, replacing former assistant Neil Baker. Davis immediately led the team to a 16-match unbeaten run in early 2012 up to 7th position, earning the club a play-off place. Crewe defeated Southend United in the two-legged semi-final, extending the unbeaten run to a club record 18 matches and securing a play-off final against Cheltenham Town at Wembley on 27 May 2012 which they won 2\u20130; the goalscorers were academy graduates Nick Powell and Byron Moore.\nBefore the 2012\u201313 season, Crewe sold Powell to Manchester United, and on transfer deadline day captain Ashley Westwood joined Aston Villa. However, with new academy players coming into the first team, Crewe returned to Wembley to win the Football League Trophy, beating Southend United 2\u20130 in the final in April 2013. In the league, Crewe finished in mid-table; they ended the season by fielding a team whose starting line-up were all Crewe Academy graduates.\nIn March 2014, John Bowler, Crewe chairman since 1988, was honoured with the Contribution to League Football Award at The Football League Awards. Dario Gradi had earlier won the same award, in 2011. In the 2015 New Year Honours, Bowler was awarded an MBE for services to football; Gradi was presented an MBE in January 1998.\nCrewe retained their place in League One in the 2013\u201314 season, but started the following season poorly, gaining four points from the first 11 League games. Some sustained runs of better results pulled the club out of the relegation places. The team needed at least a home draw against Bradford City to secure safety but lost 1\u20130 and had to rely on results elsewhere to ensure League One football for another year, finishing two points above the bottom four in 20th.\nThe 2015\u201316 season started in a similar pattern, with the team winning just two of their first 15 league games. They also crashed out of the FA Cup in the first round against non-league Eastleigh, forcing Davis to defend his position as the 'right man' for the job. Crewe's relegation to League Two was confirmed following a 3\u20130 defeat at local rivals Port Vale, with five games remaining. After an initially promising start to the following season, Crewe's form slumped in late 2016, and on 8 January 2017, Davis was sacked as Crewe manager.\nFormer Crewe defender and Academy operations manager David Artell replaced Davis. Artell maintained the flow of academy players and, as Crewe improved to 15th at the end of the 2017\u201318 season, he emulated Davis in selecting another starting line-up who were all Crewe Academy graduates.\nAfter 36 years involvement with the club, Gradi, 78, announced his retirement from all positions at Crewe Alexandra on 7 October 2019. In February 2020, further changes to the club's board were announced with local businessman Stuart Whitby and former Nantwich Town chairman Tony Davison joining the board following a \u00a31.75m buy-out of majority shareholder Norman Hassall. The Railwaymen Supporters Society also raised \u00a3250,000, to earn the right for a Crewe fans' representative on the club's new board.\nOn the pitch, Artell's progress since 2017 culminated in Crewe vying for promotion for much of the 2019\u201320 season, with the club top of the table (ahead of Swindon Town on goal difference) when the football season was suspended in March 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. On 9 June, Crewe's promotion to League One was confirmed, but Swindon were crowned League Two champions on the basis of average points per game. Artell was selected as League Two Manager of the Year in the League Managers Association Awards\u2014becoming the first Crewe manager to win such an annual award\u2014and two Academy graduates, Perry Ng and Charlie Kirk, were named in the PFA League Two Team of the Year. Crewe finished 12th in League One at the end of the 2020\u201321 season \u2013 the club's highest finish since relegation from the Championship in 2006.\nHowever, the following season was \"one of the worst\" seasons in Crewe's modern history; the club was relegated with four games still to play after a 2\u20130 defeat at Doncaster Rovers on 9 April 2022. Two days later, Crewe parted company with Artell; assistant manager Alex Morris was appointed interim manager,\nbecoming the permanent manager on 28 April 2022. However, just over six month later, on 4 November 2022, Morris, winless in nine games, stepped down as manager for family reasons and reverted to assistant manager. Lee Bell became interim manager and on 1 December 2022 was given the job on a permanent basis.\nBell managed the side to 13th place at the end of the 2022\u201323 season, improving to 6th place the following season; in the play-offs, they beat Doncaster to reach a fourth play-off final, but lost 2\u20130 to Crawley Town at Wembley on 19 May 2024. Crewe vied for promotion for much of the 2024\u201325 season and were in the automatic promotion places until late January, but won just three of their last 18 games to eventually finish 13th again.\nStadiums.\nAlexandra Recreation Ground.\nUntil 1896, Crewe played at the Alexandra Recreation Ground, located just to the north of the modern-day Gresty Road. After playing at various venues in 1896 and 1897, including in nearby Sandbach, the club returned to the same area of Crewe, adjacent to Crewe railway station, to play at the first Gresty Road ground, located to the south-east of the original stadium. In 1906 the ground was demolished to make way for some new railway lines, and a new Gresty Road stadium was built on a site directly to the west.\nGresty Road.\nThe pitch runs approximately east to west, with teams playing either west towards Gresty Road or east towards the railway station. The main stand has always been situated on the south side of the ground. Until the 1990s, the main stand was a wooden structure, built in 1932 after a fire destroyed the original stand, offering the ground's only (wooden) seating plus a standing area\u2015'The Paddock'\u2015while the other three sides were all standing terraces. This configuration saw the club's record attendance when 20,000 people watched the FA Cup third round tie against Spurs in 1960.\nDuring the 1990s, phased modernisation saw open terracing at the \"Railway End\" (at one time a roughly formed \"ash bank\" terraced with sleepers) replaced by a new family stand in 1993. The \"Gresty Road End\" (then the main away supporters area) was also replaced by an all-seater stand in 1995; and the partially-covered northern stand (the home supporters' \"Pop Side\") was replaced by an all-seater stand in 1996\u201397. Completion of the final phase in 2000, including construction of a new \u00a35.2 million main stand, saw some reorganisation of seating allocations. Away fans are currently accommodated in the stand along the northern touchline, with the option of additional capacity in the family stand for particularly large visiting contingents; Crewe hosted its first crowd of over 10,000 in the now all-seater stadium in 2000 with the record attendance of 10,092 when Crewe played Manchester City on 12 March 2002. The Gresty Road End and main stand are solely for home supporters.\nIn June 2021, the club agreed a \u00a30.5m naming rights deal with its then long-term shirt sponsor Mornflake; the ground would be called the \"Mornflake Stadium\"; in December 2023, Mornflake extended their stadium and shirt sponsorship, and in April 2025 it extended its stadium naming rights deal again. Also known as the Alexandra Stadium, it has an all-seated capacity of 10,153. It features four stands:\nShould the ground require expansion, the most likely change will be redevelopment of the Ice Cream Van Stand to become a two-tiered stand. In February 2023, the club announced plans to install 3,000 solar panels above spaces in the car park south of the main (Boughey) stand, with energy to be used to power the stadium or to bring in cash.\nClub identity.\nSince the late 1890s, the main (home) Crewe playing strip has featured a red or predominantly red top, usually with white shorts (though red and black shorts have also been briefly adopted) and red socks. The team played in white shirts and blue shorts from 1886 to 1896, but have since played mainly in red and white. The red shirts earned the early nickname of the \"Robins\", though the club is more commonly referred to as the \"Alex\" or the \"Railwaymen\" (reflecting the club's railway works founders, the town's associations with the railway industry, and the club's proximity to Crewe railway station).\nCrewe's away colours have varied. Blue, white or blue-and-white shirts have been the most commonly adopted, but during the 21st century, the club has also occasionally played in other colours; black with a gold trim was adopted for the 2021\u20132022 season, then light and dark blue vertical stripes the following season.\nThe town's crest appeared on the team's shirts in the 1958\u201359 season. This included a lion\u2015associated with the Marquess of Crewe\u2015holding a cogged wheel, a larger six-spoked railway wheel, and two wheatsheaves reflecting south Cheshire's agricultural connections. This was replaced in 1975 by a simpler badge with a lion holding a railway wheel\u2015a motif borrowed from British Rail\u2015on a circle containing the words 'Crewe Alexandra Football Club' arranged around a football. The current badge, adopted in 1998, features a lion perched on a football, encircled by a laurel and the club's name; it dropped the railway wheel, prompting some Crewe fans to demand the club \"bring back the wheel\". The club's mascot is also a lion: Gresty the Lion appears on matchdays and in other community activities.\nThe longest-standing shirt sponsor was cereals supplier Mornflake\u2015also based in Gresty Road\u2015whose logo appeared on the shirts from 2005. In December 2023, Mornflake extended their shirt sponsorship, making it the longest continual agreement in the EFL, and October 2024 saw the 1,000th game since Mornflake's shirt sponsorship began. In April 2025, Whitby Morrison was announced as the club's new shirt sponsor, while Mornflake extended their ground naming rights sponsorship.\nSupporters and rivalries.\nAttendances.\nCrewe is the third largest town in Cheshire: its built-up area had a total population of 76,437 in 2021. Founded by employees of the railway works, the club drew many of its supporters from the works, as well as residents from more rural areas surrounding the town. The club's location next to Crewe railway station has also helped supporters travel to and from games at Gresty Road. This enables many Alex fans to travel in from various nearby towns, especially in Cheshire and North Shropshire, and also further afield. From the 1920s through to the 1960s, attendances typically averaged around 6,000, but local derbies could more than double crowds: the visit of Stoke City on 26 October 1926 attracted 15,102, for example, while Port Vale drew 17,883 on 21 September 1953, Crewe's record league crowd. Cup matches against major clubs such as Spurs also drew large crowds (a record 20,000 in 1960). However, league attendances dwindled in the 1970s and 1980s, when seasonal averages of under 2,000 were recorded four times, with 1986-87 being lowest: 1,817; just 1,009 watched a 1\u20131 draw with Peterborough United on 4 February 1986. Crewe's resurgence from the mid-1980s under Gradi boosted local interest, with 5,000-plus attendances increasingly common, even as Gresty Road's transition to an all-seater stadium began to restrict numbers in the late 1990s; average attendance peaked at 7,741 in 2004 during Crewe's years in the Championship. League Two crowds before the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown in 2020 averaged 4,580, just below their all-time average, 4,583. Crewe's average home attendance in the 2024\u20132025 season was 5,397.\nTicket prices at Gresty Road are broadly in line with other clubs' rates for all-seated areas. In the BBC's 2017 Price of Football survey, Crewe's tickets for individual League Two games cost a maximum of \u00a322 (15 other clubs charged higher prices); the most expensive Crewe season ticket cost \u00a3325 (only one other club, Accrington Stanley, charged less for its most expensive season tickets), and its lowest priced season ticket (\u00a3280) was in the mid-range for the division. For the 2021\u20132022 season in League One, matchday tickets cost a maximum of \u00a325.\nRivalries.\nCrewe's main rivals are fellow English Football League team Port Vale. As of November 2024, the clubs have played 84 games since 1892 (8 games against Burslem Port Vale); overall, Crewe have won 20 games, Port Vale have won 40, with the teams drawing 24 games. The rivalry (known by some since the 1980s as the A500 Derby) intensified after the millennium, when both clubs were in Leagues One and Two, with close encounters sometimes resulting in violence and arrests. In January 2015 at Vale Park, Crewe won 1\u20130 to seal their first league double over Port Vale, and two arrests were made at the game, with minor disturbances between rival fans after the match. Six arrests were made at Gresty Road during the 22 September 2018 meeting between the two sides. A 2019 study ranked the Port Vale-Crewe Alexandra rivalry as the 14th biggest rivalry in English professional football.\nCrewe also maintain smaller rivalries with Wrexham, Salford City, Shrewsbury Town, Stoke City and traditional local Cheshire derbies with Macclesfield, Chester City, Stockport County and Tranmere Rovers. The Railwaymen's rivalry with Stockport intensified somewhat in 2009 when Stockport all but relegated Crewe from League One, after beating them 4\u20133 at Edgeley Park. Crewe then returned the favour on 30 April 2011, when they beat County 2\u20130 at Gresty Road, confirming County's relegation to non-League football.\nSongs and music.\nIn the 1950s, Crewe's fans were the first to sing the song \"Blue Moon\"\u2015also sung by fans of Manchester City\u2015(with lyrics that do not quite match the Rodgers and Hart original) and said to be a response to the gloomy days of the 1950s and 1960s, or reflecting an old joke that the team only wins 'once in a blue moon', i.e., rarely. During the 1990s, one Crewe supporter, classically trained musician Richard Sutton, was known for taking a trumpet to games, playing occasional fanfares such as the theme from \"Star Wars\" during matches. The Crewe-based dance trio Dario G were named after Dario Gradi.\nRailwaymen Supporters Society.\nCrewe supporters often sing a song featuring the line \"We are the Railwaymen\". Aggregating and formalising several former Crewe supporters groups, and supported by the national Football Supporters' Association, the independent Railwaymen Supporters Society was established in 2018, and incorporated as a community benefit society on 8 July 2019. Initiatives have included a campaign, Project250, to raise \u00a3250,000 to invest in club shares and gain representation on the club's board (achieved in February 2020), and the establishment of an Ex-Players Association (Gareth Whalley is its president).\nReputation.\nPlayer development.\nAs an early professional club in the late 19th century, several Crewe players achieved international selection, particularly for Wales. During the 20th century, however, Crewe had few stars. Welsh international Fred Keenor played his final league games for the club and his last international cap in 1932 was Crewe's first of the century. Some players started or developed their careers at Crewe before achieving fame elsewhere. For example, forward Frank Blunstone played 48 League games for Crewe in the early 1950s before a move to Chelsea and five England caps, Stan Bowles scored 18 Crewe goals in 51 games in the early 1970s and went on to play for Queens Park Rangers and England, and goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar played 24 Crewe matches at the start of the 1980s before moving to Liverpool.\nCrewe's conscious investment in young players began in the late 1980s when then manager Dario Gradi and club chairman John Bowler got the local council to contribute towards the costs of an all-weather pitch at Gresty Road. This formed the starting point for a youth coaching facility, which by the early 1990s was coaching 120 youngsters every week. In 1995, Crewe leased a 20-acre site at Reaseheath, near Nantwich, planning a \u00a3750,000 training and player development facility largely funded by transfer sales. In 1996, Crewe received a lottery grant to develop a youth coaching facility in nearby Shavington. By 2015, player sales had generated over \u00a320 million which had contributed to modernising Gresty Road and developing Crewe's Academy, making it the only club outside the top two divisions to have a Category Two academy club; in 2022, it was ranked in the top 10 academies in England and Wales.\nPlayers who passed through the ranks since establishment of the academy include England internationals Geoff Thomas and David Platt, Wales international Robbie Savage, and Northern Ireland's Neil Lennon and Steve Jones. These were all youngsters signed from other clubs, but the academy also nurtured Crewe's own trainees\u00a0\u2013 most notably England internationals Rob Jones, Danny Murphy, Seth Johnson and Dean Ashton, plus Wales midfielder David Vaughan.\nSexual abuse scandal.\nOn 16 November 2016, former Crewe defender Andy Woodward revealed that he had been the victim of child sexual abuse by former football coach Barry Bennell (convicted as a paedophile in the US in 1994) at the club in the 1980s. By the time club chairman John Bowler responded to the revelations, on Monday 21 November, six other individuals had contacted the police, with Woodward's Crewe teammate Steve Walters alleging he was another of Bennell's victims. Woodward criticised Crewe for failing to apologise. On 27 November 2016, a third former Crewe player, Anthony Hughes, revealed that he too had been abused by Bennell, as did Crewe trainee, later Wimbledon and Northern Ireland international Mark Williams.\nBennell was tried at Liverpool Crown Court in early 2018, and convicted of 50 offences of sexual abuse against 12 boys (and on 20 February 2018 was sentenced to 30 years in prison). After the guilty verdicts on 15 February, victims including Andy Woodward and Steve Walters read statements outside court. Crewe Alexandra expressed its \"deepest sympathies\" to Bennell's victims, saying it was not aware of any sexual abuse by Bennell nor had it received any complaint about sexual abuse by him before or during his employment with the club, though this has been disputed.\nWalters accused Crewe of \"victim blaming\" in a bid to avoid compensation payouts. He and at least one other former Crewe player launched High Court damages claims of upwards of \u00a3200,000 against the club; an eight-week trial was listed to start in October 2021. On 19 March 2019, the \"Guardian\" reported Crewe Alexandra planned to contest victims' claims, but later (27 March 2019), reported an apparent U-turn in Crewe's approach; it had agreed an out-of-court financial settlement with one of Bennell's victims. Andy Woodward had unsuccessfully sued Crewe for damages in 2004.\nCrewe were additionally criticised for not holding an independent review into how they dealt with historical child sex abuse allegations. In March 2018, the said that, as it had fully co-operated with police investigations, it did \"not intend to commission a further independent investigation,\" and the police's report had also been supplied to the FA review headed by Clive Sheldon. This decision was criticised by local MP Laura Smith, by MP Damian Collins, chair of the DCMS select committee, by Crewe Town Council, and by the Professional Footballers Association's Gordon Taylor. In his final report, Sheldon said he \"liaised with the Club and its lawyers with a view to suggesting other lines of enquiry that could usefully be followed up by the Club. Ultimately, the Club agreed to conduct those further enquiries, and provided me with a report setting out its conclusions.\"\nThe FA's 710-page report, published on 17 March 2021, identified failures to act adequately on complaints or rumours of sexual abuse at eight professional clubs including Crewe. Considering whether senior Crewe people knew about Bennell, Sheldon concluded they had not received specific reports of abuse. However, directors had discussed concerns about inappropriate behaviour, and the club \"should have done more to check on the well-being of the boys\". Following publication of the report, Crewe Alexandra apologised to all survivors of Bennell's abuse, expressing \"wholehearted regret\" about their ignorance of his crimes, and Gradi also apologised. With Gradi \"effectively banned for life\" from football for safeguarding reasons, Crewe chairman John Bowler was pressed to resign and did so on 25 March 2021. Awarded an MBE in 1998, Gradi was stripped of the award in August 2023 following a professional disbarment for failing to protect children from sexual abuse.\nRecords.\nCrewe's biggest league victory came against Rotherham United on 1 October 1932 in the Third Division North when they won 8\u20130. In the FA Cup, their biggest win was 9\u20131 over Northwich Victoria on 16 November 1889. The club's heaviest defeat was in the FA Cup in 1960 when they were beaten 13\u20132 by Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 30 January 1960, a game watched by 64,365: the largest crowd for a match involving Crewe. In the league, Crewe's worst performance saw them beaten 11\u20131 at Lincoln City on 29 September 1951 in the Third Division North.\nTommy Lowry made the most first team appearances in all competitions for Crewe: 482 between 1965 and 1977. Bert Swindells holds the record for most Crewe goals: 128, scored from 1927 to 1937, while Terry Harkin scored the most Crewe goals in a single season: 34 in 1964\u201365. Best match return was five goals, scored by Tony Naylor in Crewe's 7\u20131 league defeat of Colchester United at Gresty Road on 24 April 1993.\nWilliam Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886. Clayton Ince, with 31 caps for Trinidad and Tobago, has won most caps while playing for Crewe. Efe Sodje is the only Crewe player to play in a World Cup Finals tournament, for Nigeria against Argentina, on 2 June 2002, and then against England on 12 June 2002, both in Japan.\nCrewe's most expensive player was Rodney Jack, signed from Torquay United in August 1998 for \u00a3650,000. Crewe were reported to have received \u00a33 million for Nick Powell when he moved to Manchester United on 2 July 2012, with options for the fee to grow to \u00a36 million depending on appearances. Crewe also received \u00a33 million for Seth Johnson's 1999 move to Derby County, and for Dean Ashton's move to Norwich City in 2005.\n \"As of 1 September 2025\"\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFormer players.\nIn 2004 the BBC's \"Football Focus\" asked fans of all professional football clubs in England and Scotland to vote for their cult hero. For Crewe, Seth Johnson won with 59% of the vote; Danny Murphy came second with 33%, and Craig Hignett third with 8%.\nFull international players.\nWilliam Bell was the first Crewe player to win an international cap, playing for Wales against Ireland in Wrexham in February 1886. On 15 March 1890, three Crewe players \u2013 Alfred Davies (also Wales captain), Dick Jones and Billy Lewis \u2013 played in Wales's 3\u20131 defeat by England in Wrexham; Lewis scored Wales's goal, the first international goal scored by a Crewe player. John 'Jackie' Pearson became the first Crewe player to win an international cap for England, playing against Ireland in Belfast on 5 March 1892. He remains the only Crewe player capped for England while playing at the club. Donervon Daniels was the most recent Crewe player to win a full international cap; he played for Montserrat in their FIFA World Cup 2022 qualifier against US Virgin Islands on 2 June 2021.\nManagement.\nManagerial history.\nSince 1892, 29 men have managed Crewe. Dario Gradi holds the record for the most games: 1,359 first team games. Two Crewe managers have been inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame: Gradi in 2004 and Harry Catterick, posthumously, in 2010.\n\"As of 11 November 2025. Only competitive matches are counted.\"\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n \"As of 11 August 2023.\"\nHonours.\nLeague\nCup\nCrewe Alexandra have never won a division title, and have only been division runners-up twice. In addition to play-off promotions, the club also achieved four promotions, all from the fourth tier, by third-place finishes in 1962\u201363 and 1993\u201394 and by fourth-place finishes in 1967\u201368 and 1988\u201389. Crewe's highest finishing league position was 11th in the second tier, the First Division in 1997\u201398.\nIn the major cup competitions, Crewe reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup in 1888. They have reached the third round of the League Cup ten times (1960, 1974, 1975, 1978, 1992, 1999, 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008), losing 1\u20130 to Aston Villa in a replay at Villa Park in 1974, and taking cup holders Manchester United into extra time at Gresty Road in 2006 before losing 2\u20131.\nWhile Crewe is not in Wales, English clubs, usually from border areas, have participated by invitation in the Welsh Cup, which Crewe won twice, in 1936 and 1937. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup 19 times up to 1998, and have won it a further three times, most recently in 2017.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is known for playing Louie the Garbage Man on the TV show \"Chico and the Man\", and Dick Hallorann in Stanley Kubrick's \"The Shining\" (1980). He was also a prolific voice actor who provided the voices of Meadowlark Lemon in the \"Harlem Globetrotters\" animated TV series, Jazz the Autobot in \"The Transformers\" and \"\" (1986), the title character in \"Hong Kong Phooey\", and Scat Cat in the Disney animated film \"The Aristocats\" (1970).\nMusic career.\nCrothers began his musical career as a teenager. He sang and was self-educated on guitar and drums. He was in a band that played in speakeasies in Terre Haute, Indiana. During the 1930s, Crothers formed a band, spending eight years living in Akron, Ohio, and performing five days a week on a radio show in Dayton, Ohio. The station manager thought he needed a catchier name, so Crothers suggested \"Scatman\" for his scat singing. He married Helen Sullivan, a native of Steubenville, Ohio, in 1937. In the 1940s, the couple moved to California.\nHe performed in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York City. Capitol released several of his singles, including \"I'd Rather Be a Hummingbird\", \"Blue-Eyed Sally\", and \"Television Blues\". High Fidelity Records released his album \"Rock and Roll with Scatman Crothers\". He went on USO tours with Bob Hope. Crothers also performed with bandleader Slim Gaillard. According to the jacket notes of the \"Let Freedom Sing\" CD set, Crothers was part of the music group The Ramparts, who sang \"The Death of Emmett Till\" (1955), a song by A. C. Bilbrew.\nFilm and television career.\nCrothers made his film debut in the movie \"Meet Me at the Fair\" (1953). He had roles in the film musical \"Hello Dolly!\" (1969) and \"The Great White Hope\" (1970) before providing the voice of Scat Cat in the animated film \"The Aristocats\" (1970). Crothers appeared in four films with Jack Nicholson: \"The King of Marvin Gardens\" (1972), \"The Fortune\" (1975), \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975), and \"The Shining\" (1980). He had the part of a fable-telling convict in the animated film \"Coonskin\" (1975), a train porter in \"Silver Streak\" (1976), a liveryman in \"The Shootist\" (1976), Mingo in \"Roots\" (1977), Tinker the piano player in Neil Simon's \"The Cheap Detective\" (1978), a ringmaster in \"Bronco Billy\" (1980), a baseball coach in \"Zapped!\" (1982), and angels in \"Two of a Kind\" (1983) and \"\" (1983).\nCrothers became the first black person to appear regularly in a Los Angeles television show when he joined \"Dixie Showboat\". After portraying Scat Cat in \"The Aristocats\" in the 1970s, Crothers found voice acting jobs as Meadowlark Lemon in the \"Harlem Globetrotters\" cartoon series and as the title character in \"Hong Kong Phooey\". For four years, he played the role of Louie the garbage man on \"Chico and the Man\". During his appearance on \"Sanford and Son\" Crothers joined Redd Foxx for two musical numbers. One was a version of the standard \"All of Me\", in which he accompanied Foxx on tenor guitar. In 1966, Hanna-Barbera aired an animated special called \"The New Alice in Wonderland (or What's a Nice Kid like You Doing in a Place like This?)\", an updated version of the Lewis Carroll story featuring Sammy Davis Jr. as the Cheshire Cat. The special was followed by an audio adaptation for HB Records, but since Davis was signed to Reprise Records, Crothers provided the cat's voice for the album.\nCrothers had guest roles on \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" in 1958, \"Dragnet\" in 1967, \"Bewitched\" and \"McMillan &amp; Wife\" in 1971, \"Adam-12\" in 1972 (as \"George Strothers\"), \"Kojak\" and \"Ironside\" in 1973, \", Mannix\" and \"Sanford and Son\" in 1974, \"Starsky &amp; Hutch\" in 1977, \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"The Love Boat\" in 1978, \"Magnum, P.I.\" in 1980, \"Benson\" in 1982, and \"Taxi\" in 1983. Also in 1980, he was on two episodes of \"Laverne &amp; Shirley\" as a porter. In the 1980s, he provided the voice of the Autobot Jazz on the television series \"The Transformers\". He starred in three short-lived 1980s television series: \"One of the Boys\" (1982), \"Casablanca\" (1983), and \"Morningstar/Eveningstar\" (1986).\nDeath.\nAround 1985, Crothers was diagnosed with an inoperable malignant tumor in his lung which metastasized to his esophagus. He was bedridden weeks before his death and had slipped into a coma. On November 22, 1986, Crothers died at age 76 at his home in Van Nuys, California after struggling with lung cancer.

{"id": "69440", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69440", "title": "Edge effects", "text": "Ecological concept\nIn ecology, edge effects are changes in population or community structures that occur at the boundary of two or more habitats. Areas with small habitat fragments exhibit especially pronounced edge effects that may extend throughout the range. As the edge effects increase, the boundary habitat allows for greater biodiversity.\nUrbanization is causing humans to continuously fragment landscapes and thus increase the edge effect. This change in landscape ecology is proving to have consequences. Generalist species, especially invasive ones, have been seen to benefit from this landscape change whilst specialist species are suffering. For example, the alpha diversity of edge-intolerant birds in Lacandona rainforest, Mexico, is decreasing as edge effects increase. \nTypes.\nHeight can create borders between patches as well.\nBiodiversity.\nEnvironmental conditions enable certain species of plants and animals to colonize habitat borders. Plants that colonize forest edges tend to be shade-intolerant. These plants also tend to be tolerant of dry conditions, such as shrubs and vines. Animals that colonize tend to be those that require two or more habitats, such as white-tailed and mule deer, elk, cottontail rabbits, blue jays, and robins. Some animals travel between habitats, while edge species are restricted to edges. Larger patches have increased native species biodiversity compared to smaller patches. The width of the patch also influences diversity: an edge patch must be more pronounced than just a stark border in order to develop gradients of edge effects. \nAnimals traveling between communities can create travel lanes along borders, which in turn increases light reaching plants along the lanes and promotes primary production. As more light reaches the plants, greater numbers and sizes can thrive. Increased primary production can increase numbers of herbivorous insects, followed by nesting birds and so on up the trophic levels.\nIn the case of wide and/or overgrown borders, some species can become restricted to one side of the border despite having the ability to inhabit the other. Sometimes, the edge effects result in abiotic and biotic conditions which diminish natural variation and threaten the original ecosystem. Detrimental edge effects are also seen in physical and chemical conditions of border species. For instance, fertilizer from an agricultural field could invade a bordering forest and contaminate the habitat. The three factors affecting edges can be summarized:\nHuman effects.\nHuman activity creates edges through development and agriculture. Often, the changes are detrimental to both the size of the habitat and to species. Examples of human impacts include:\nExamples.\nWhen edges divide any natural ecosystem and the area outside the boundary is a disturbed or unnatural system, the natural ecosystem can be seriously affected for some distance in from the edge. In 1971, Odum wrote, 'The tendency for increased variety and diversity at community junctions is known as the \"edge effect\"... It is common knowledge that the density of songbirds is greater on estates, campuses and similar settings...as compared with tracts of uniform forest.'. In a forest where the adjacent land has been cut, creating an open/forest boundary, sunlight and wind penetrate to a much greater extent, drying out the interior of the forest close to the edge and encouraging growth of opportunistic species there. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil moisture, light intensity and levels of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) all change at edges.\nAmazon rainforest.\nOne study estimated that the amount of Amazon Basin area modified by edge effects exceeded the area that had been cleared. \"In studies of Amazon forest fragments, micro-climate effects were evident up to 100m (330ft.) into the forest interior.\" The smaller the fragment, the more susceptible it is to fires spreading from nearby cultivated fields. Forest fires are more common close to edges due to increased light availability that leads to increased desiccation and increased understory growth. Increased understory biomass provides fuel that allows pasture fires to spread into the forests. Increased fire frequency since the 1990s is among the edge effects that are slowly transforming Amazonian forests. The changes in temperature, humidity and light levels promote invasion of non-forest species, including invasive species. The overall effect of these fragment processes is that all forest fragments tend to lose native biodiversity depending on fragment size and shape, isolation from other forest areas, and the forest matrix.\nNorth America.\nThe amount of forest edge is orders of magnitude greater now in the United States than when the Europeans first began settling North America. Some species have benefited from this fact, for example, the brown-headed cowbird, which is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of songbirds nesting in forest near the forest boundary. Another example of a species benefiting from the proliferation of forest edge is poison ivy. \nConversely, Dragonflies eat mosquitoes, but have more trouble than mosquitoes surviving around the edges of human habitation. Thus, trails and hiking areas near human settlements often have more mosquitoes than do deep forest habitats. Grasses, huckleberries, flowering currants and shade-intolerant trees such as the Douglas-fir all thrive in edge habitats.\nIn the case of developed lands juxtaposed to wild lands, problems with invasive exotics often result. Species such as kudzu, Japanese honeysuckle and multiflora rose have damaged natural ecosystems. Beneficially, the open spots and edges provide places for species that thrive where there is more light and vegetation that is close to the ground. Deer and elk benefit particularly as their principal diet is that of grass and shrubs which are found only on the edges of forested areas.\nEffects on succession.\nEdge effects also apply to succession, when vegetation spreads rather than losing to competitors. Different species are suited either to the edges or to central sections of the habitat, resulting in a varied distribution. Edges also vary with orientation: edges on the north or south receive less or more sun than the opposite side (depending on hemisphere and convex or concave relief), producing varying vegetation patterns.\nOther usage.\nThe phenomenon of increased variety of plants as well as animals at the community junction (ecotone) is also called the edge effect and is essentially due to a locally broader range of suitable environmental conditions or ecological niches.\nEdge effects in biological assays refer to artifacts in data that are caused by the position of the wells on a screening plate rather than a biological effect.\nThe edge effect in scanning electron microscopy is the phenomenon in which the number of secondary and/or backscattered electrons that escape the sample and reach the detector is higher at an edge than at a surface. The interaction volume spreads far below the surface, but secondary electrons can only escape when close to the surface (generally about 10\u00a0nm, although this depends on the material). However, when the electron beam impacts an area close to the edge, electrons that are generated below an impact point that is close to an edge but that is far below the surface may be able to escape through the vertical surface instead.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge \nof a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.\nWaterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling onto softer rock, which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall. Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.\nHumans have had a distinct relationship with waterfalls since prehistory, travelling to see them, exploring and naming them. They can present formidable barriers to navigation along rivers. Waterfalls are religious sites in many cultures. Since the 18th century, they have received increased attention as tourist destinations, sources of hydropower, and\u2014particularly since the mid-20th century\u2014as subjects of research.\nDefinition and terminology.\nA waterfall is generally defined as a point in a river where water flows over a steep drop that is close to or directly vertical. In 2000 Mabin specified that \"The horizontal distance between the positions of the lip and plunge pool should be no more than 25% of the waterfall height.\" There are various types and methods to classify waterfalls. Some scholars have included rapids as a subsection. What actually constitutes a waterfall continues to be debated.\nWaterfalls are sometimes interchangeably referred to as \"cascades\" and \"cataracts\", though some sources specify a cataract as being a larger and more powerful waterfall and a cascade as being smaller. A plunge pool is a type of stream pool formed at the bottom of a waterfall. A waterfall may also be referred to as a \"foss\" or \"force\".\nFormation.\nWaterfalls are commonly formed in the upper course of a river where lakes flow into valleys in steep mountains.\nA river sometimes flows over a large step in the rocks that may have been formed by a fault line. Waterfalls can occur along the edge of a glacial trough, where a stream or river flowing into a glacier continues to flow into a valley after the glacier has receded or melted. The large waterfalls in Yosemite Valley are examples of this phenomenon, which is referred to as a hanging valley. Another reason hanging valleys may form is where two rivers join and one is flowing faster than the other.\nWhen warm and cold water meets by a gorge in the ocean, large underwater waterfalls can form as the cold water rushes to the bottom.\nCaprock model.\nThe caprock model of waterfall formation states that the river courses over resistant bedrock, erosion happens slowly and is dominated by impacts of water-borne sediment on the rock, while downstream the erosion occurs more rapidly. As the watercourse increases its velocity at the edge of the waterfall, it may pluck material from the riverbed, if the bed is fractured or otherwise more erodible. Hydraulic jets and hydraulic jumps at the toe of a falls can generate large forces to erode the bed, especially when forces are amplified by water-borne sediment. Horseshoe-shaped falls focus the erosion to a central point, also enhancing riverbed change below a waterfall.\nA process known as \"potholing\" involves local erosion of a potentially deep hole in bedrock due to turbulent whirlpools spinning stones around on the bed, drilling it out. Sand and stones carried by the watercourse therefore increase erosion capacity. This causes the waterfall to carve deeper into the bed and to recede upstream. Often over time, the waterfall will recede back to form a canyon or gorge downstream as it recedes upstream, and it will carve deeper into the ridge above it. The rate of retreat for a waterfall can be as high as one-and-a-half metres per year.\nOften, the rock stratum just below the more resistant shelf will be of a softer type, meaning that undercutting due to splashback will occur here to form a shallow cave-like formation known as a rock shelter under and behind the waterfall. Eventually, the outcropping, more resistant cap rock will collapse under pressure to add blocks of rock to the base of the waterfall. These blocks of rock are then broken down into smaller boulders by attrition as they collide with each other, and they also erode the base of the waterfall by abrasion, creating a deep plunge pool in the gorge downstream.\nStreams can become wider and shallower just above waterfalls due to flowing over the rock shelf, and there is usually a deep area just below the waterfall because of the kinetic energy of the water hitting the bottom. However, a study of waterfalls systematics reported that waterfalls can be wider or narrower above or below a falls, so almost anything is possible given the right geological and hydrological setting. Waterfalls normally form in a rocky area due to erosion. After a long period of being fully formed, the water falling off the ledge will retreat, causing a horizontal pit parallel to the waterfall wall. Eventually, as the pit grows deeper, the waterfall collapses to be replaced by a steeply sloping stretch of river bed. In addition to gradual processes such as erosion, earth movement caused by earthquakes or landslides or volcanoes can lead to the formation of waterfalls.\nEcology.\nWaterfalls are an important factor in determining the distribution of lotic organisms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, as they may restrict dispersal along streams. The presence or absence of certain species can have cascading ecological effects, and thus cause differences in trophic regimes above and below waterfalls. Certain aquatic plants and insects also specialize in the environment of the waterfall itself. A 2012 study of the Agbokim Waterfalls, has suggested that they hold biodiversity to a much higher extent than previously thought.\nWaterfalls also affect terrestrial species. They create a small microclimate in their immediate vicinity characterized by cooler temperatures and higher humidity than the surrounding region, which may support diverse communities of mosses and liverworts. Species of these plants may have disjunct populations at waterfall zones far from their core range.\nWaterfalls provide nesting cover for several species of bird, such as the black swift and white-throated dipper. These species preferentially nest in the space behind the falling water, which is thought to be a strategy to avoid predation.\nTypes.\nSome waterfalls are also distinct in that they do not flow continuously. Ephemeral waterfalls only flow after a rain or a significant snowmelt. Waterfalls can also be found underground and in oceans.\nHumans and waterfalls.\nResearch.\nThe geographer Andrew Goudie wrote in 2020 that waterfalls have received \"surprisingly limited research.\" Alexander von Humboldt wrote about them in the 1820s. There is no name for the specific field of researching waterfalls, and in the published literature been described as \"scattered\", though it is popular to describe studying waterfalls as \"waterfallology\". An early paper written on waterfalls was published in 1884 by William Morris Davis, a geologist known as the \"father of American geography\". In the 1930s Edward Rashleigh published a pioneering work on waterfalls. In 1942 Oscar von Engeln wrote of the lack of research on waterfalls:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Waterfall sites more than any other geomorphic feature attract and hold the interest of the general public. Because they have such a popular approval\nwaterfalls are not given serious attention by some students of systematic geomorphology. This attitude is not to be commended. Waterfalls are significant items for geomorphic investigation.\nAs late as 1985 a scholar felt that \"waterfalls remain a very much neglected aspect of river studies\". Studies of waterfalls increased dramatically in the second half of the 20th century. Numerous waterfall guidebooks exist, and the World Waterfall Database is a website cataloging thousands of waterfalls.\nExploration and naming.\nMany explorers have visited waterfalls. European explorers recorded waterfalls they came across. In 1493, Christopher Columbus noted Carbet Falls in Guadeloupe, which was likely the first waterfall Europeans recorded seeing in the Americas. In the late 1600s, Louis Hennepin visited North America, providing early descriptions of Niagara Falls and the Saint Anthony Falls. The geographer Brian J. Hudson argues that it was uncommon to specifically name waterfalls until the 1700s. The trend of Europeans specifically naming falls was in tandem with increased scientific focus on nature, the rise of Romanticism, and increased importance of hydropower with the Industrial Revolution. European explorers often preferred to give waterfalls names in their own language; for instance, David Livingstone named Victoria Falls after Queen Victoria, though it was known by local peoples as Mosi-oa-Tunya. Many waterfalls have descriptive names which can come from the river they are on, places they are near, their features, or events that happened near them.\nSome countries that were colonized by European nations have taken steps to return names to waterfalls previously renamed by European explorers. Exploration of waterfalls continues; the Gocta Cataracts were first announced to the world in 2006.\nWaterfalls can pose major barriers to travel. Canals are sometimes built as a method to go around them, other times things must be physically carried around or a railway built.\nDevelopment and tourism.\nWaterfalls are often visited by people simply to see them. Hudson theorizes that they make good tourism sites because they are generally considered beautiful and are relatively uncommon. Activities at waterfalls can include bathing, swimming, photography, rafting, canyoning, abseiling, rock climbing, and ice climbing. Waterfalls can also be sites for generating hydroelectric power and can hold good fishing opportunities. Wealthy people were known to visit areas with features such as waterfalls at least as early as in Ancient Rome and China. However, many waterfalls were essentially inaccessible due to the treacherous terrain surrounding them until improvements began to be made such as paths to the falls, becoming common across the United Kingdom and America in the 1800s and continuing through the 1900s and into the 21st century. Remote waterfalls are now often visited by air travel.\nHuman development has also threatened many waterfalls. For instance, the Gua\u00edra Falls, once one of the most powerful waterfalls in the world, were submerged in 1982 by a human-made dam, as were the Ripon Falls in 1952. Conversely, other waterfalls have seen significantly lower water levels as a result of diversion for hydroelectricity, such as the Tyssestrengene in Norway. Development of the areas around falls as tourist attractions has also destroyed the natural scene around many of them.\nWaterfalls are included on thirty-eight World Heritage Sites and many others are protected by governments.\nIn culture.\nWaterfalls play a role in many cultures, as religious sites and subjects of art and music.\nMany artists have painted waterfalls and they are referenced in many songs, such as those of the Kaluli people in Papua New Guinea. Michael Harner titled his study of the Jivaroan peoples of Ecuador \"The Jivaro: People of the Sacred Waterfalls.\" Artists such as those of the Hudson River School and J. M. W. Turner and John Sell Cotman painted particularly notable pictures of waterfalls in the 19th century.\nOne of the versions of the Shinto purification ceremony of misogi involves standing underneath a waterfall in ritual clothing. In Japan the Nachi Falls are a site of pilgrimage, as are falls near Tirupati, India, and the Saut-d'Eau, Haiti. The Otavalos use Piguchi waterfall as part of the Churru ritual which serves as a coming of age ceremony. Many waterfalls in Africa were places of worship for the native peoples and got their names from gods in the local religion.\n\"In Chinese tradition, the waterfall represents\" the season of autumn, yin, and the Chinese dragon's power over water that comes from the former two.\nList.\nThere are thousands of waterfalls in the world, though no exact number has been calculated. The World Waterfall Database lists 7,827 as of 2013, but this is likely incomplete; as noted by Hudson, over 90% of their listings are in North America. Many guidebooks to local waterfalls have been published. There is also no agreement how to measure the height of a waterfall, or even what constitutes one. Angel Falls in Venezuela is the tallest waterfall in the world, the Khone Phapheng Falls in Laos are the widest, and the Inga Falls on the Congo River are the biggest by flow rate, while the Dry Falls in Washington are the largest confirmed waterfalls ever. The highest known subterranean waterfall is in Vrtoglavica Cave in Slovenia. The Denmark Strait cataract is an undersea overflow which could be considered a \"waterfall\" under a very broad usage of that term; if so included, it is the largest known waterfall.\nArtificial waterfalls are water features or fountains that imitate a natural waterfall. The Cascata delle Marmore is the tallest artificially built waterfall at .\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69443", "revid": "19735932", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69443", "title": "Mutiny", "text": "Disobeying of superiors\nMutiny is a revolt among a group of people (typically of a military or a crew) to oppose, change, or remove their superiors or orders. The term is commonly used for insubordination by members of the military against an officer or superior, but it can also sometimes mean any type of rebellion against any force. Mutiny does not necessarily need to refer to a military force and can describe a political, economic, or power structure in which subordinates defy superiors.\nDuring the Age of Discovery, mutiny particularly meant open rebellion against a ship's captain. This occurred, for example, during Ferdinand Magellan's journeys around the world, resulting in the killing of one mutineer, the execution of another, and the marooning of others; on Henry Hudson's \"Discovery\", resulting in Hudson and others being set adrift in a boat; and the famous mutiny on the \"Bounty\".\nMutiny is widely considered a serious crime, punishable by imprisonment, penal labour or death. Failure to prevent or suppress a mutiny may also be punishable depending on the circumstances; negligent failure may result in dishonourable discharge while wilful failure may bring any punishment including death. The UK has passed various Mutiny Acts to establish procedure and punishment, the latest of which is the Armed Forces Act 2006. Military mutineers are usually tried at court martial, represented by counsel. Pirate captains have been known to mete out punishment \"ad hoc\" without due process.\nPenalty.\nThose convicted of mutiny often faced capital punishment.\nUnited Kingdom.\nUntil 1689, mutiny was regulated in England by \"Articles of War\" instituted by the monarch and effective only in a period of war. In 1689, the first Mutiny Act was approved, which passed the responsibility to enforce discipline within the military to Parliament. The Mutiny Act, altered in 1803, and the Articles of War defined the nature and punishment of mutiny until the latter were replaced by the Army Discipline and Regulation Act in 1879. This, in turn, was replaced by the Army Act in 1881.\nToday the Armed Forces Act 2006 defines mutiny as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;(2)For the purposes of this section a person subject to service law takes part in a mutiny if\u2014\n(a)in concert with at least one other person subject to service law, he\u2014\n(i)acts with the intention of overthrowing or resisting authority; or\n(ii)disobeys authority in such circumstances as to subvert discipline;\n(b)he agrees with at least one other person subject to service law to overthrow or resist authority; or\n(c)he agrees with at least one other person subject to service law to disobey authority, and the agreed disobedience would be such as to subvert discipline.\nThe same definition applies in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.\nThe military law of England in early times existed, like the forces to which it applied, in a period of war only. Troops were raised for a particular service and were disbanded upon the cessation of hostilities. The crown, by prerogative, made laws known as Articles of War for the government and discipline of the troops while thus embodied and serving. Except for the punishment of desertion, which was made a felony by statute in the reign of Henry VI, these ordinances or Articles of War remained almost the sole authority for enforcing discipline until 1689. That year, the first Mutiny Act was passed and the military forces of the crown were brought under the direct control of Parliament. Even the Parliamentary forces in the time of Charles I and Oliver Cromwell were governed not by an act of the legislature, but by articles of war similar to those issued by the king and authorized by an ordinance of the Lords and Commons exercising in that respect the sovereign prerogative. This power of law-making by prerogative was however held to be applicable during a state of actual war only, and attempts to exercise it in times of peace were ineffectual. Subject to this limitation, it existed for considerably more than a century after the passing of the first Mutiny Act.\nFrom 1689 to 1803, the Mutiny Act occasionally expired during times of peace. Yet statutory power was given to the crown to make Articles of War that operated in the colonies and elsewhere beyond the seas in the same manner as those made by prerogative in times of war.\nIn 1715, in consequence of the rebellion, this power was created in respect of the forces in the kingdom, but apart from and in no respect affected the principle acknowledged all this time that the crown of its mere prerogative could make laws for the government of the army in foreign countries in time of war.\nThe Mutiny Act 1803 effected a great constitutional change in this respect: the power of the Crown to make any Articles of War became altogether statutory, and the prerogative merged in the act of Parliament. The Mutiny Act 1873 was passed in this manner.\nSuch matters remained until 1879 when the last Mutiny Act was passed and the last Articles of War were promulgated. The Mutiny Act legislated for offences in respect of which death or penal servitude could be awarded. Meanwhile, the Articles of War, while repeating those provisions of the act, constituted the direct authority for dealing with offences for which imprisonment was the maximum punishment, as well as with many matters relating to trial and procedure.\nThe act and the articles were found not to harmonize in all respects. Their general arrangement was faulty, and their language sometimes obscure. In 1869, a royal commission recommended that both should be recast in a simple and intelligible shape. In 1878, a committee of the House of Commons endorsed this view and made recommendations for performing the task. In 1879, a measure was passed into law consolidating in one act both the Mutiny Act and the Articles of War, and amending their provisions in certain important respects. This measure was called the Army Discipline and Regulation Act 1879.\nAfter one or two years of experience highlighted the need for improvement, it was superseded by the Army Act 1881, which formed the foundation and main portion of the military law of England. The act contained a proviso saving the right of the crown to make Articles of War, but in such a manner as to render the power in effect a nullity by enacting that no crime made punishable by the act shall be otherwise punishable by such articles. As the punishment of every conceivable offence was provided, any articles made under the act could be no more than an empty formality having no practical effect.\nThus the history of English military law up to 1879 may be divided into three periods, each having a distinct constitutional aspect: (I) prior to 1689, the army, being regarded as so many personal retainers of the sovereign rather than servants of the state, was mainly governed by the will of the sovereign; (2) between 1689 and 1803, the army, being recognised as a permanent force, was governed within the realm by statute and without it by the prerogative of the crown; and (3) from 1803 to 1879, it was governed either directly by statute or by the sovereign under an authority derived from and defined and limited by statute. Although in 1879 the power of making Articles of War became in effect inoperative, the sovereign was empowered to make rules of procedure, having the force of law, to regulate the administration of the act in many matters formerly dealt with by the Articles of War. These rules, however, must not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Army Act itself, and must be laid before parliament immediately after they are made. Thus in 1879, the government and discipline of the army became for the first time completely subject either to the direct action or the close supervision of Parliament.\nA further notable change took place at the same time. The Mutiny Act had been brought into force on each occasion for one year only, in compliance with the constitutional theory:\nthat the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace, unless with the consent of parliament, is against law. Each session therefore the text of the act had to be passed through both Houses clause by clause and line by line. The Army Act, on the other hand, is a fixed permanent code. But constitutional traditions are fully respected by the insertion in it of a section providing that it shall come into force only by virtue of an annual act of parliament. This annual act recites the illegality of a standing army in time of peace unless with the consent of parliament, and the necessity nevertheless of maintaining a certain number of land forces (exclusive of those serving in India) and a body of royal marine forces on shore, and of keeping them in exact discipline, and it brings into force the Army Act for one year.\nSentence.\nUntil 1998, mutiny and another offence of failing to suppress or report a mutiny were each punishable with death. Section 21(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 completely abolished the death penalty in the United Kingdom. (Prior to this, the death penalty had already been abolished for murder, but it had remained in force for certain military offences and treason, although no executions had been carried out for several decades.) This provision was not required by the European Convention on Human Rights, since Protocol 6 of the Convention permitted the death penalty in time of war, and Protocol 13, which prohibits the death penalty for all circumstances, did not then exist. The government introduced section 21(5) as a late amendment in response to parliamentary pressure.\nUnited States.\nThe United States' Uniform Code of Military Justice defines mutiny thus:\nArt. 94. (\u00a7 894.) 2004 Mutiny or Sedition.\n(a) Any person subject to this code (chapter) who\u2014\n(1) with intent to usurp or override lawful military authority, refuses, in concert with any other person, to obey orders or otherwise do his duty or creates any violence or disturbance is guilty of mutiny;\n(2) with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of lawful civil authority, creates, in concert with any other person, revolt, violence, or other disturbance against that authority is guilty of sedition;\n(3) fails to do his utmost to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence, or fails to take all reasonable means to inform his superior commissioned officer or commanding officer of a mutiny or sedition which he knows or has reason to believe is taking place, is guilty of a failure to suppress or report a mutiny or sedition.\n(b) A person who is found guilty of attempted mutiny, mutiny, sedition, or failure to suppress or report a mutiny or sedition shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.\nU.S. military law requires obedience only to lawful orders. Disobedience to unlawful orders (see Superior orders) is the obligation of every member of the U.S. military, a principle established by the Nuremberg and Tokyo Trials following World War II and reaffirmed in the aftermath of the My Lai Massacre during the Vietnam War. However, a U.S. soldier who disobeys an order after deeming it unlawful will almost certainly be court-martialed to determine whether the disobedience was proper. In addition, simple refusal to obey is not mutiny, which requires collaboration or conspiracy to disobedience.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69445", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69445", "title": "Jules Maigret", "text": "Fictional French police detective\nJules Maigret (), or simply Maigret, is a fictional French police detective, a \"commissaire\" (\"commissioner\") of the Paris \"Brigade Criminelle\" (\"Direction R\u00e9gionale de la Police Judiciaire de Paris:36, Quai des Orf\u00e8vres\"), created by writer Georges Simenon. The character's full name is Jules Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ois Maigret.\nBetween 1931 and 1972, 75 novels and 28 short stories about Maigret were published, starting with \"Pietr-le-Letton\" (\"The Strange Case of Peter the Lett\") and concluding with \"Maigret et Monsieur Charles\" (\"Maigret and Monsieur Charles\"). The novels and stories have been translated into more than 50 languages.\nThe Maigret stories have also received numerous film, television, and radio adaptations. Penguin Books published new translations of 75 books in the series over as many months. The project was begun in November 2013 by translators David Bellos, Anthea Bell, and Ros Schwartz.\nCharacter.\nCreation.\nThe character of Maigret was invented by Simenon while drinking in a cafe and imagining a Parisian policeman: \"a large powerfully built gentleman...a pipe, a bowler hat, a thick overcoat.\" Maigret was reputed to be based on Marcel Guillaume, an actual French detective, although Simenon himself variously claimed not to remember the inspiration or that Maigret was influenced by Simenon's own father.\nBiographers Thomas Narcejac and Fenton Bresler both see Simenon himself in his creation.\nDescription.\nMaigret is described as a large, broad-shouldered man; he is gruff but patient and fair.\nRecurring characters in the series include Maigret's wife Louise (usually referred to simply as Madame Maigret) and in particular \"The Faithful Four\", a group consisting of his four loyal police colleagues (Sgt./Inspector Lucas, Janvier, Lapointe, and Torrence).\nOther prominent characters include police surgeon Dr. Paul, Judge Com\u00e9liau, the Examining Magistrate who alternates between being a help and a hindrance to Maigret, and Dr. Pardon, Maigret's friend and physician.\nMaigret doesn't like his first name being used and prefers to be simply called \"Maigret\". Even Maigret's wife largely restricts herself to calling him \"Maigret\", only calling him by his first name a handful of times.\nIn most novels, Maigret is aged around 45 to 55 years. There are contradictory clues to his year of birth. In \"Monsieur Gallet, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9\", which takes place in 1930, Maigret is described as 45, indicating 1885 as his year of birth. In another novel \"La premi\u00e8re enquete de Maigret\", where the investigation takes place in 1913, the author states that Maigret is 26, which establish his year of birth as 1887. In the 1932 novel \"L'affaire Saint-Fiacre\", Maigret is 42, which would mean he was born in 1890, assuming that Maigret is contemporary to the year the novel was written.\nMaigret began working as a police officer in Paris in his twenties. At the age of 30, he entered the Homicide Squad and later, nearing his forties, became chief inspector of the squad. It is mentioned that Maigret retired when in his mid-fifties, which gave him over 30 years of experience in the police.\nHe was from the village of Saint-Fiacre in the Allier Department, where his father Evariste Maigret was the bailiff for the local landowner; see Simenon's novel \"Maigret's Failure\" (\"Un \u00e9chec de Maigret\"), about a school bully and contemporary, \"Fatty\" Ferdinand Fumal from the same village.\nCharacteristics.\nMaigret wears a thick black overcoat and a bowler hat (which he later swaps out for a fedora) and frequently smokes a tobacco pipe. He is described as tall and heavy, with broad shoulders, large hands, a thick face, thick hair, thick eyebrows and bright eyes of a \"greenish gray\" colour. He has strongly growing facial hair and therefore shaves every morning.\nIn his investigations, Maigret's method is to put himself in another person's place in order to discover why the crime was committed, rather than just finding out whodunit. He is described as a person with extraordinary humanity.\nList of Works.\nNovels.\nList of Maigret novels with date of French-language publication as well as the Penguin reissue dates and titles.\nShort stories.\nList of Maigret short stories by date of first publication in French.\nIn other media.\nAudiobooks.\nFollowing the Penguin reissue of the 75 novels, actor Gareth Armstrong started recording each for Audible. Recordings took one day per book. By September 2015, he had recorded 25 of them. He has since completed all 75 recordings.\nTheatre.\nA production called \"Maigret and the Lady\" by Philip Mackie toured in England and Scotland in 1965, before playing at the Strand Theatre in London in October 1965. Madame Maigret was played by Charmian Eyre, and Maigret was Rupert Davies.\nFilm.\nThe cinematic potential of Maigret was realized quickly: the first screen Maigret was Pierre Renoir in 1932's \"Night at the Crossroads\", directed by his brother Jean Renoir; the same year brought \"The Yellow Dog\" with Abel Tarride, and Harry Baur played him in 1933's \"A Man's Neck\", directed by Julien Duvivier.\nIn 1950, Charles Laughton played the first English-language Maigret in \"The Man on the Eiffel Tower\", adapted from the 1931 novel \"A Battle of Nerves\". The film co-starred Franchot Tone, Burgess Meredith, and Wilfrid Hyde-White. Back in France, Michel Simon played the character in \"Full House\".\nAlbert Pr\u00e9jean portrayed Maigret in three films: \"Picpus\", \"Cecile Is Dead\", and \"Majestic Hotel Cellars\". A decade later, Jean Gabin played the part in three other films: \"Maigret Sets a Trap\", \"Maigret et l'Affaire Saint-Fiacre\", and \"Maigret voit rouge\". Maurice Manson appeared in \"Maigret dirige l'enqu\u00eate\" (1956), whilst Heinz R\u00fchmann played the lead in a 1966 European international co-production \"Enter Inspector Maigret\".\nGerard Depardieu starred as Maigret in a 2022 French film, entitled \"Maigret\", adapted from \"Maigret and the Dead Girl\".\nIn 2024, director Pascal Bonitzer announced he will write and direct \"Maigret and the Dead Lover\", starring Denis Podalyd\u00e8s.\nTelevision.\nThere have been numerous incarnations of Maigret on the small screen all around the world. He has been portrayed by French, British, Irish, Austrian, German, Italian, Dutch, Japanese, and Russian actors. A French version, \"Les Enqu\u00eates du Commissaire Maigret\", starred Jean Richard in 88 episodes between 1967 and 1990; however, Simenon himself is said to have disliked Richard's Maigret because he would not take his hat off when entering a room. Later, Bruno Cremer played the character in 54 adaptations between 1991 and 2005.\nRomney Brent played Maigret in the \"Studio One\" episode \"Stan the Killer\", whilst Luis van Rooten starred in an episode of \"Suspense\" entitled \"The Old Lady of Bayeux\". Louis Arbessier appeared in a televised film of \"Liberty Bar\".\nThe Italian actor Gino Cervi played the character on Italian television from 1964 up to 1972 in \"Le inchieste del commissario Maigret\"; Simenon himself considered Cervi's interpretation of the character to be \"very good.\" This series resulted in 14 novels and 2 short stories being adapted.\nIn the late 1960s, Simenon's son Marc created a television spinoff entitled \"\". Pierre Tornade starred as Maigret's former sidekick Torrence, now working for a private investigation agency. The series featured guest appearances by other characters from the Maigret canon, including inspectors Lucas (Pierre Mondy), and Janvier (Louis Arbessier).\nIn the Soviet Union, Russian theatre actor Boris Tenin portrayed Maigret in several TV films in the 1970s. In Soviet cinema, apart from Boris Tenin, Maigret was portrayed by cinema actors Vladimir Samoilov and Armen Dzhigarkhanyan.\nIn Japan, Kinya Aikawa played \"Megure\", a Japanese-born equivalent to the French Maigret, reinvented in a modern Japanese setting, in T\u014dky\u014d. \"Megure Keishi\", a 25-episode TV series aired from 14 April to 29 May 1978 on Asahi TV. Megure's wife was played by Sato Tomomi, who earned the praises of Simenon himself: \"The best 'Madame Maigret' in my opinion, even including the French ones, was the 'Madame Maigret' on Japanese television. She was exactly right\".\nRupert Davies played the title role in the 1960s British \"Maigret\" TV series, which debuted on 31 October 1960. Davies took over the part after Basil Sydney, who appeared as Maigret in the original transmitted pilot, proved unavailable owing to ill-health. Davies went on to star in 52 adaptations for BBC TV in that decade. His portrayal won two of the highest accolades: his versions were dubbed into French and played across the Channel; and Simenon himself said of Davies \"At last, I have found the perfect Maigret!\" The theme tune to the TV series, \"Midnight in Montmartre\", was composed by Ron Grainer. Kees Brusse and Jan Teulings also portrayed the character in separate Dutch adaptations produced around the same time.\nGranada Television produced an adaptation of \"Maigret\" for ITV in 1992 and 1993 in which Michael Gambon starred as Maigret; there were 12 adaptations in the two series. An earlier version, \"Maigret\" (1988) on ITV cast Richard Harris in the lead role.\nIn 2004, Sergio Castellitto played Maigret in two Italian TV movies: \"La trappola\" (\"The Trap\") and \"L'ombra cinese\" (\"The Chinese Shadow\").\nRowan Atkinson played Maigret in four television films made by ITV from 2016 to 2017. The first two episodes were adapted from \"Maigret Sets a Trap\" and \"Maigret's Dead Man\". Two further episodes were broadcast in 2017, adapted from \"Maigret at the Crossroads\" and \"Maigret in Montmartre\".\nIn 2021, the Simenon estate signed a co-production and licensing deal with Playground Entertainment and Red Arrow Studios to produce a new English-language series, with the option extending to the entire Maigret canon. In September 2024, the cast and crew for the series was announced, led by Ben Wainwright as Maigret. The new series first aired in October, 2025.\nRadio.\nMaurice Denham played Chief Inspector Maigret in a series of three-quarter-hour dramatizations of the novels on BBC Radio 4 beginning in 1976, with Michael Gough playing Georges Simenon. The format of each play would begin with Maigret and Simenon sitting together discussing some fact or event which would then lead into Maigret's recounting a particular case, with Simenon asking questions or commenting from time to time. After Denham's death, the series was continued in 2003 with Nicholas Le Prevost playing a gruffer, more earthy Maigret and Julian Barnes playing Simenon.\nIn the interim, Bernard Hepton starred in a 1986 Saturday Night Theatre adaptation of \"Maigret's Special Murder\", whilst Barry Foster played the detective in 1998's \"Maigret's Christmas\" for the Afternoon Play.\nIn 1990-1991, abridgments of some of the novels (including \"Madame Maigret's Case,\" \"Maigret and the Tavern by the Seine,\" and \"Maigret in Montmartre\") were serialized in daily one-minute installments on WNCN, a classical music station in New York City. They were read every night at midnight in a radio program called the \"H.B.J.

Rumeu (drawings) and Camille Dulac (script) adapted the Maigret story L'Affaire Nahour into the comic strip \"Maigret\" in 1969.

It consists of one or more layers of epithelial cells overlying a layer of loose connective tissue. It is mostly of endodermal origin and is continuous with the skin at body openings such as the eyes, eyelids, ears, inside the nose, inside the mouth, lips, the genital areas, the urethral opening and the anus. Some mucous membranes secrete mucus, a thick protective fluid. The function of the membrane is to stop pathogens and dirt from entering the body and to prevent bodily tissues from becoming dehydrated.\nStructure.\nThe mucosa is composed of one or more layers of epithelial cells that secrete mucus, and an underlying lamina propria of loose connective tissue. The type of cells and type of mucus secreted vary from organ to organ and each can differ along a given tract.\nMucous membranes line the digestive, respiratory and reproductive tracts and are the primary barrier between the external world and the interior of the body; in an adult human the total surface area of the mucosa is about 400 square meters while the surface area of the skin is about 2 square meters. Along with providing a physical barrier, they also contain key parts of the immune system and serve as the interface between the body proper and the microbiome.\nExamples.\nSome examples include:\nDevelopment.\nDevelopmentally, the majority of mucous membranes are of endodermal origin. Exceptions include the palate, cheeks, floor of the mouth, gums, lips and the portion of the anal canal below the pectinate line, which are all ectodermal in origin.\nFunction.\nOne of its functions is to keep the tissue moist (for example in the respiratory tract, including the mouth and nose). It also plays a role in absorbing and transforming nutrients. Mucous membranes also protect the body from itself. For instance, mucosa in the stomach protects it from stomach acid, and mucosa lining the bladder protects the underlying tissue from urine. In the uterus, the mucous membrane is called the endometrium, and it swells each month and is then eliminated during menstruation.\nNutrition.\nNiacin and vitamin A are essential nutrients that help maintain mucous membranes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its roots can be traced back to 1858 when the Brighton School of Art was opened in the Royal Pavilion. It achieved university status in 1992.\nThe University focuses on practical, creative, and professional education, with the majority of degrees awarded also recognised by professional organisations or leading to professional qualifications. Subjects include pharmacy, engineering, ecology, computing, art, architecture, geology, nursing, teaching, sport science, journalism, criminology and business. It has around 18,000 students and 2,400 staff. The QS World University Rankings places the university within the top 100 internationally for Art and Design.\nHistory.\n1858\u20141900: Early years.\nIn 1858 the Brighton School of Art opened its doors to its first 110 students, in rooms by the kitchens of the Royal Pavilion. It moved in 1876 to its own building in Grand Parade, with the Prime Minister, William Gladstone, witnessing the laying of the new building's foundation stone.\nThe Municipal School of Science and Technology opened in Brighton in 1897 with 600 enrolled students. In the 1960s new buildings were constructed in Moulsecoomb for what had become the Brighton College of Technology. In 1970 the School of Art and Brighton College of Technology merged to form Brighton Polytechnic.\nWhat became known as the Chelsea College of Physical Education opened in 1898 in London under the headship of Dorette Wilkie. A two year course was offered where teachers were taught to teach. The college moved to Eastbourne in 1947. In 1976 it merged with Eastbourne and Seaford Colleges of Education to form the East Sussex College of Higher Education. The same year, Brighton College of Education (the teacher training college) merged with Brighton Polytechnic, giving the Polytechnic a campus at Falmer. It had opened in 1909 as the Municipal Day Training College in Richmond Terrace, Brighton.\n1900\u20142000: University status.\nThere was a further merger in 1979, when the East Sussex College of Higher Education merged with the polytechnic, creating a campus in Eastbourne. That institution had opened in London in 1898 as an institution training women and girls in physical education and moved to Eastbourne in 1949.\nUK polytechnics were granted university status in 1992 and Brighton Polytechnic became the University of Brighton under the provisions of the Further and Higher Education Act, 1992.\nIn 1994 the Sussex and Kent Institute of Nursing and Midwifery became part of the University, increasing the number of students based in Eastbourne.\n2000\u2014present.\nIn 2003 the Brighton and Sussex Medical School opened as a partnership between the University of Brighton, the University of Sussex and the Universities Hospitals Trust, the first medical school in South East England outside London.\nA Hastings campus was opened in 2003, originally named University Centre Hastings; it was subsequently closed in 2016.\nIn 2011, the Brighton International College, part of Kaplan International Colleges, opened on the Moulsecoomb campus, to provide international students with English language courses and preparatory academic tuition for undergraduate and postgraduate courses.\nIn October 2019 the University launched the first new contemporary publics arts space in the city since 1999, named the Brighton Centre for Contemporary Arts. Brighton CCA is accessible to students and the public, hosting public exhibitions, events and commissioned work.\nIn 2023, students and staff protested in opposition to the university's plans to make 110 staff redundant, the protests ultimately failed to prevent redundancies and 104 lecturers were made redundant through 82 voluntary redundancies and 22 compulsory redundancies.\nIn May 2023, the University's Centre for Contemporary Arts was closed, the university says this is due to rising inflation, the \"tuition fee freeze\", and high energy costs.\nCampuses and facilities.\nThe University currently has three campuses: Falmer, City and Moulsecoomb.\nIn 2018, the University of Brighton gained a first class award in the People &amp; Planet's University League table \u2013 UK universities ranked by environmental and ethical performance.\nFalmer campus, Brighton.\nThe Falmer campus is approximately three miles from Brighton city centre. The School of Education, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Sport and Health Sciences, Centre for Nursing and Midwifery Research, International Health Development and Research Centre, Social Science Policy and Research Centre, Education Research Centre, the Centre for Learning and Teaching and the Brighton and Sussex Medical School are all based on this campus.\nFalmer railway station is immediately adjacent, as is the Falmer Stadium, home to Brighton &amp; Hove Albion FC, which opened in 2011.\nFacilities on the Falmer campus include a library, computer pool rooms, restaurant and cafe/bar, and the Students' Union cafe, aka The Hive, and shop. Sports facilities on the campus include floodlit 3G AstroTurf pitch, netball and tennis courts, a sports centre with fitness suite, two activity studios and a sports hall with six badminton courts, and a new sports pavilion which opened in 2015.\nCity campus, Brighton.\nCity campus in Brighton city centre is home to the University's School of Art and Media, (formerly the Faculty of Arts), the School of Humanities and Social Science, the University of Brighton gallery and Sallis Benney Theatre (presumably named after E.

Facilities include the specialist humanities, art and design library at St Peter's House, computer pool rooms, a media centre, a restaurant and cafe.\nMoulsecoomb campus, Brighton.\nThe Moulsecoomb campus is to the north of Brighton city centre on Lewes Road. Moulsecoomb railway station is nearby. It is the largest of the three campuses with over 8,000 students based there in the School of Applied Sciences, School of Architecture, Technology and Engineering and the School of Business and Law.\nTeaching and learning resources include rapid prototyping and design equipment including 3D scanners, CNS lathes and laser cutters, clinical skills and molecular biology laboratories, specialist labs for structural dynamics, geotechnics, thermal dynamics, hydraulics and avionics, a flight simulator, real-time trading room, and architecture and interior architecture studios. Facilities include Aldrich Library, computer pool rooms, two restaurants and five cafes. The new advanced engineering building opened in September 2017, and Elm House opened in 2021.\nThe University of Brighton and Ricardo UK jointly opened the Sir Harry Ricardo Laboratories on 14 November 2006. The laboratories are one of the largest UK research teams dedicated to internal combustion engines, the development of laser-based measurement techniques, fundamental modelling and computational simulation.\nThe University of Brighton Students' Union has its main offices in Cockcroft Building.\nEastbourne.\nThe Eastbourne campus was in the south-western part of the town of Eastbourne, and had almost 3,000 students before its closure in 2024.\nTeaching and learning facilities at Eastbourne campus included exercise physiology laboratories, an environmental chamber, a human movement laboratory and the Leaf Hospital podiatry and physiotherapy clinic. Study facilities in Eastbourne included Queenwood library, computer pool rooms, a learning technologies suite, restaurants, and a students' Union shop. Sports facilities included a 25-metre swimming pool, sports hall, artificial outdoor pitch and dance studio.\nThe University closed this campus in 2024.\nLibraries.\nThe University has three libraries spread around its campuses.\nEach library is typically open between 55 and 68 hours per week, including evenings and weekends.\nOrganisation and administration.\nThe University is organized in academic schools:\nMedical school.\nThe Brighton and Sussex Medical School is one of four medical schools to have been created as part of the UK government's strategy of increasing the number of qualified doctors from the UK working in the NHS. The school is a joint school of the University of Brighton and the University of Sussex. The University of Brighton provides professional aspects of the course while the University of Sussex provides biological science teaching.\nSchool of Business and Law.\nThe School of Business and Law delivers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, part-time courses for professionals, and programmes for commercial organisations. Formerly part of Brighton Technical College, the school has been teaching business and management courses since the 1960s. It took its current name in 1986. The school is in Elm House on the Moulsecoomb campus, following a large redevelopment.\nThe University of Brighton is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) \u2013 an accreditation achieved by fewer than 6% of business schools globally.\nAcademic profile.\nThe University of Brighton offers over 400 courses in a wide range of subjects.\nUniversity of Brighton's International College provides academic preparatory programmes for students outside the EU. On successful completion of their programme and achievement of the required grades, students can progress to undergraduate and postgraduate degrees offered at the university.\nUniversity of Brighton Doctoral College provides academic, administrative and practical support for the University's community of postgraduate research students. There are Doctoral College campus centres on the Eastbourne and each of the Brighton campuses.\nPartnerships.\nThe University validates degree-level courses taught at a number of partner colleges.\nThe University of Brighton also validates higher education courses taught at the KLC School of Design, London.\nReputation and rankings.\nThe University's Community University Partnership Programme received an honourable mention at the 2010 Community-Campus Partnerships for Health awards and was highly commended in the Social Responsibility category at the 2009 Green Gown Awards.\nBrighton is in the top 50 universities in England for graduate prospects in the Complete University Guide league tables \u2013 reflecting the number of graduates who are in highly skilled employment or further study 15 months after they graduate.\nThe university gained a Silver award in the national Teaching Excellence Framework 2023, recognising the quality of their teaching and student outcomes.\nThe 2008 Research Assessment Exercise confirmed that 79% of the University of Brighton's research output is of international standing. Taking the top three grades, the results show that 15 per cent of the research is 'world-leading' (the highest grade), 29 per cent is internationally excellent (the second highest grade) and 35 per cent is internationally recognised (the third highest grade). The University's RAE ranking rose from 80th place in 2001 to 59th in 2008, leading it to be described as one of the \"rising stars\" in the UK. Sixty-five per cent of research in art and design at the Faculty of Arts was classified as either \"world-leading\" or \"internationally excellent\". This places Brighton amongst the leading research centres in the country for art and design and Research Fortnight ranked the submission second in terms of the volume and quality of research. Brighton is also ranked as one of the leading modern universities in terms of the quality of its research by the Research Fortnight newsletter.\nStudent life.\nStudents on each campus have access to services including a careers advisory service, counselling service, student advice service, disability and dyslexia service, and chaplaincy.\nBrighton Students' Union is the representative body for students. The BSU is a charity and is headed up by four full-time elected student officers. The BSU represent the student voice at the University, ensuring that they're using student feedback to make positive changes that make student life better. They support students with appeals, mitigating circumstances and other academic issues that may occur. \nThe BSU also organises a variety of activities and events throughout the year; including societies, sports, student media and more. Buzz Radio is a student-led campus radio station with studios in Brighton. There are a number of shops and caf\u00e9s across University of Brighton campuses that are run by the BSU.\nNotable alumni, staff and associates.\nMany prominent figures in the arts have attended the University, or the institutions from which it was formed. These include Turner Prize winners Keith Tyson and Rachel Whiteread (1982\u201385) studied at the Faculty of Arts, Brighton, as did Keith Coventry, the winner of 2010 John Moores Painting Prize, the photographer Ewen Spencer, the artist Alison Lapper, the designer Julien Macdonald and the writer-illustrator Emily Gravett.\nFormer students also include the artists Paine Proffitt, Cliff Wright, illustrator of the Harry Potter books, the designer Julien Macdonald OBE, and musicians Natasha Khan, (who performs as Bat for Lashes), and The Haxan Cloak\nThe list of students, lecturers and researchers once at Brighton includes Kate Greenaway Medal winners Emily Gravett, Raymond Briggs and Quentin Blake; children's writer-illustrator Lucy Cousins; Magnum photographer Mark Power; fashion designer Barbara Hulanicki; world champion bridge player Sandra Landy; and adventurer and conservationist Holly Budge.\nLiz Aggiss, the live artist, dance performer, choreographer and film maker, taught visual performance at Brighton from 1982. She is now Emeritus Professor of Visual Performance.\nContributions made to modern visual culture by Brighton Faculty of Arts and Architecture members include Royal Designer for Industry George Hardie's cover designs for Pink Floyd's \"The Dark Side of the Moon\", and several series of Royal Mail stamps, and John Vernon Lord's sleeve for Deep Purple's \"Book of Taliesyn\".\nIn 2000 a group of graduates from the BA Illustration course formed the successful Peepshow Collective.\nThe longer history of the school of art in Brighton includes the artists Conrad Heighton Leigh, and poster designer John Bellany. The artist Helen Chadwick took the sculpture course at Brighton Polytechnic (1973\u201376) and later returned to the institution to teach. The artist Cherryl Fountain also attended the polytechnic. The sculptor/woodcarver Robert Koenig, author of the woodcarving project Odyssey also studied on the sculpture course at the same time as Helen Chadwick. The sculptor Antony Gormley formerly taught at Brighton.

There are multiple villages alongside the seaside resorts of Brighton and Hove in the district. It is administered by Brighton and Hove City Council, which is currently under Labour majority control. \nThe two resorts, along with Worthing and Littlehampton in West Sussex, make up the second most-populous built-up area of South East England, after South Hampshire. In 2014, Brighton and Hove City Council and other nearby councils formed the Greater Brighton City Region local enterprise partnership area.\nUnification.\nIn 1992, a government commission was set up to conduct a structural review of local government arrangements across England. In its draft proposals for East Sussex, the commission suggested two separate unitary authorities be created for the towns of Brighton and Hove, with the latter authority to include Hove, Worthing and the Adur District. Support within Brighton for its own unitary authority was high, however respondents in Hove expressed reservations towards a merger with Worthing and Adur. A report following consultation noted that more than 25% of respondents in both Brighton and Hove had \"unprompted, indicated support for a merger of those two areas.\" Although this option had not been included in the draft proposals, subsequent polling indicated that the merger was the most popular option among residents.\nNevertheless, the proposal of a merger proved controversial, particularly in Hove. Hove Borough Council opposed the move on the grounds that Brighton would dominate affairs in the city, and the commission acknowledged that residents of Hove \"have significant negative feelings towards Brighton\" and greater identification towards Sussex. Ultimately, the view was taken that support for a single tier of government in both towns outweighed opposition to unification, and as a result the commission recommended that the borough councils of Brighton and Hove be made a single unitary authority independent of East Sussex County Council. In 1997, Brighton and Hove Borough Council was formed, and assumed responsibility for all matters of local government across both towns.\nTwenty years earlier, as part of the Queen's Silver Jubilee celebrations, Brighton had been shortlisted as a candidate for city status, though eventually lost out to larger Derby. Following unification of the towns, Brighton and Hove applied for city status again as part of the Millennium City Status Competition, and was subsequently granted city status on 31 January 2001. As a result, the borough council became a city council.\nAlthough the city now operates as a single entity, locals generally still consider Brighton and Hove to be separate settlements with different identities. Hove is largely residential and has its own distinct seafront and established town centre located around George Street, while Brighton has a higher profile as the country's most popular seaside resort, a significant digital economy, and hosts several festivals of national prominence. Recognition of the city's twin identities is evident from the continued popularity of the local saying \"Hove, actually\", a phrase which long predates unification.\nSome organisations such as the local football club, Brighton and Hove Albion, and the bus company Brighton &amp; Hove, predate the unification of the towns by several decades.\nIn 2014, Brighton and Hove formed the Greater Brighton City Region with neighbouring local authorities.\nAreas.\n Brighton and Hove, the downland and coastal city in the South Downs National Park\nThe City of Brighton and Hove consists of many districts, a stretch of coast and some downland areas. Just to the south of Brighton and Hove in the English Channel is the Rampion Wind Farm, which provides renewable energy to the country.\nBrighton.\nBrighton has been the most populous settlement in Sussex since at least the 17th century, and a town hall and evidence of citizen's control over town affairs predates 1580. The original parish of Brighton covered what is today much of central Brighton. The parish border ran from Little Western Street and Boundary Passage in the west, to Whitehawk Road in the east, and roughly followed the Old Shoreham Road and Bear Road to the north. The Reform Act 1832 created the parliamentary constituency of Brighton. Brighton obtained a royal charter for incorporation in 1854 and was organised into six wards: Park, Pavilion, Pier, St Nicholas, St Peter, and West. The ward of Preston was added in 1873, expanding Brighton to the north. In 1889 Brighton attained county borough status.\nThe Brighton Corporation Act 1927 added the settlements of Ovingdean and Rottingdean, as well as western parts of Falmer, Patcham and West Blatchington. These reforms expanded the Brighton the north and west dramatically. Between 1920 and 1950 housing estates were developed in Woodingdean, Moulsecoomb, Bevendean, and Whitehawk increasing the population of the town substantially. As a result, the number of wards had by now increased to 19. The rest of Falmer, Coldean and the parish of Stanmer were added to Brighton by the Brighton Extension Act 1951, completing the northward extension of the town. A final expansion of the town's boundaries was approved in 1968, incorporating reclaimed land from the sea for the Brighton Marina project.\nBrighton was split into two parliamentary constituencies in 1950. The first, Brighton Pavilion, covers the centre and north of the town. The second, Brighton Kemptown, covers the east of the town. The latter has since expanded further east to include the neighbouring towns of East Saltdean, Telscombe Cliffs, and Peacehaven, all of which are administratively within the adjacent Lewes District. Brighton became a municipal borough as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, losing unitary control of town affairs to East Sussex County Council. This reform was later followed by a reduction of wards to 16 in 1983. Brighton Borough Council remained under this structure until unification with Hove.\nHove.\nA small parish at the end of the 18th century, Hove began to expand in the early 19th century alongside the westward development of Brighton, and in 1832 became incorporated into the parliamentary constituency of Brighton. In 1873 commissioners from Hove, West Hove and Brunswick were amalgamated as means to guard against the dominance of Brighton. The first public buildings were completed in the late 19th century, including the original town hall in 1882. The parish of Aldrington was annexed by Hove in 1893. A municipal borough of Hove was formed by royal charter in 1889, granting Hove administrative autonomy. Further expansion took place in 1927, with the addition of the parishes of Preston Rural and Hangleton and westerly sections of West Blatchington and Patcham. Hove gained its own parliamentary constituency in 1950. The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the remaining parishes of Hove, Aldrington and Hangleton and West Blatchington to form the unparished non-metropolitan district of Hove. It also incorporated the nearby town of Portslade-by-Sea into the new district. The new boundaries established by the Act remained largely the same until unification with Brighton a quarter of a century later.\nPortslade, Portslade Village, and Mile Oak.\nTo the west of Brighton and Hove is Portslade. The area has three distinct centres with different histories, and includes Portslade-by-Sea, Portslade Village and Mile Oak. Each is quite different in character.\nPortslade-by-Sea is largely an industrial port, with a busy canal area that opens up to the River Adur and the English Channel. It has a long history of human settlement and the name came from the Roman port, Novus Portus.\nPortslade Village has kept more of its antiquity and retains many elements of the downland village it once was. Many of the buildings have their original flint walls, and there are some early manor house ruins, tree-lined parks, a landmark church and a former convent.\nMile Oak is a newer development. Until the 1920s it was only a small group of farm buildings with surrounding corn fields, sheep downs and market gardens. Then, suburban housing started to be built, and there was considerable further development in the 1960s with the construction of bungalows and other private housing. In the 1990s, after the construction of the new A27 road, Mile Oak's access to the Downs was largely blocked, stopping the spread of development.\nPortslade downland.\nTo the north of Mile Oak, on the other side of the A27, are a number of downland areas that are still in the Brighton and Hove area. These include the ancient chalk grassland slopes of Cockroost Hill, Cockroost Bottom and Mount Zion. They are all special areas because of the remarkable wildlife still surviving there, including rare downland flowers, orchids, butterflies and rare insects. There is a lot of history on the slopes, including a large 4000 year old Bronze Age settlement, a possible 'henge' (as in Stonehenge), now lost under the A27 bypass, and evidence of Iron Age and Romano-British field systems. To the north of the city boundary is Fulking parish. The final stretch of the Monarch's Way passes through Mile Oak and Porstlade. It is a long-distance footpath that runs from Worcester to Shoreham.\nAldrington, Hangleton and West Blatchington.\nAldrington sits between Portslade-by-Sea to its west and Hove to its east. For centuries Aldrington was largely countryside, with very few people living there for most of the Middle Ages, but it is now a residential area.\nLike Aldrington, West Blatchington was once primarily down and sheep grazing area, but is now built up. West Blatchington manor had various lords over the centuries, but unlike Adrington and Hangleton, it was always associated with lords in the east such Lewes, Falmer, and Patcham. It is now known for its windmill and secondary school. To the east of West Blatchington is Westdene.\nHangleton is to the north of Aldrington and sits between Portslade Village and West Blatchington. The manors of Hangleton and Aldrington formed part of the Fishersgate Half Hundred, together with the neighbouring manor of Portslade. The lords of the Hangleton manor from 1291 to 1446 were the de Poynings, a Sussex gentry family that gave their name to the present parish of Poynings.\nHangeton was a medieval downland village in the 13th century, and by the early 14th century it had a population of about 200. Later, the village was abandoned for around six hundred years. It started to grow again in the 1950s with other areas of Brighton and is now popular for its views of the sea and green spaces.\nHangleton and West Blatchingham downland.\nBetween Hangleton and Westdene, south of the A27, is Toads Hole Valley. Its west slope, below Downland Drive, was once an unspoilt place for wildlife and still home to threatened species such as dormice, hedgehogs, and adders. The valley has been unmanaged for many years and the area has turned to scrub. It has now been designated for development and up to three hundred homes are planned to be built on the site.\nTo the north of the A27 are two golf courses, the West Hove and Brighton and Hove Golf courses. The two are divided by the Old Dyke Railway Trail which follows part of the route taken by the old Dyke Railway Branch Line. The line opened in September 1887 and took people from Hove to the popular downland beauty spot of Devil's Dyke. When the railway closed in December 1938, the line lay unused until the Dyke Railway Trail was created in 1988. There are a number of ways through Hangleton to a bridge over the A27 bypass where the trail begins, but the original route took you from Aldrington railway station and above the Hove cemetery. Much of the trail across the Downs is on a hard surface.\nThere are many archaic Down pastures in the area. To the west is Benfield Hill (), a Local Nature Reserve which is famous for its glowworm displays on midsummer evenings. On the steep east side of the hill there is large thyme, autumn gentian and many butterflies. Bee orchids can be also found in some years. To the north of this area is the Poynings parish and the impressive geography of Devil's Dyke.\nTo the east is Round Hill where there are many signs of the past from different periods of human history. There are several old barrows in the area. There is an old flint barn () called the Skeleton Hovel which is thought to commemorate a prehistoric burial site. Round Hill's eastern slope () is the richest chalk grassland site in Hangleton, though it desperately needs grazing management for its many downland flowers such as field fleawort, chalk milkwort, orchids, cowslips, hairy violet, rockrose, crested hair-grass, and devil's bit scabious. There are two rare Forester moth species, fox moth and heath moth, purse-web spider, moss, and pygmy snails. To the north of Round Hill is the Newtimber parish.\nWestdene, Withdean, and Patcham.\nPatcham, Westdene, and Withdean are divided by the London Road. Of the three, Patcham (), has much the longest history of human settlement and retains much from its agricultural past. It was one of the bigger settlements in Sussex at the time of Domesday book, which recorded that it had 10 shepherds and 6 slaves. Even an Archbishop of Canterbury, John Pecham, came from the village. The area still has many old flint cottages, big allotment sites and winding twittens. There is Patcham Place and Park. The best cluster of buildings comprise its Norman church (which has kept part of its medieval wall paintings) and the old buildings of Patcham Court Farm, with a 17th-century flint farmhouse and dovecot.\nThe areas of Withdean and Westdene were historically farmland but have been developed, mainly in the 1920s and 1930s, with a mix of detached, semi-detached and mid-rise flats. The Withdean manor was originally the property of the great Cluniac Priory of St. Pancras at Lewes, until 1537. This was then given to Anne of Cleves in 1541 by Henry VIII. The manor was demolished in 1936. Westdene sits to the north of Brighton, east of West Blatchington and north of Withdean.\nWithdean Park is to the east of the London Road, and is home to the national collection of lilacs with over 250 varieties. Collections of berberis, cotoneaster and viburnum can also be found here. Withdean Woods is next to Withdean stadium and is a wooded hillside nature reserve approximately 2.47 acres (1 ha) in size. It is the home of several woodland birds including the great spotted woodpecker, tawny owl, goldcrest, firecrest, and in winter the stinking hellebore.\nWaterhall downland.\nTo the west of the A23 and north of Westdene and the A27 is Waterhall (), and its lost 18th century farm is now the site of football and rugby pitches. The Waterhall Golf Course has just been given over to a version of rewilding which involves the restoration of species-rich chalk grassland There is still a significant population of adders. By the bridlepath just downhill of the old clubhouse there are the damaged remains of a Bronze Age round barrow () which has long acted as a marker on the old parish boundaries. Since the cessation of golf play harebell, scabious, cowslip, rockrose, betony, Sussex rampion and horseshoe vetch have flowered ebulliently. There are large old anthills and chalkhill, small and adonis blue and brown argus butterflies, and all three species of Forester moth. At the corner of the Saddlescombe Road and the turn-off to the golf clubhouse, there is a sarsen stone () marking this point in the medieval boundary between Patcham and West Blatchington parishes.\nTo the north is Varncombe Hill, which borders the Newtimber parish. Its south-west facing slope() is heavily scrubbed-up, though lovely old pasture glades survive. Rockrose is one of the commonest flowers here, with some of its associated fungi. The west facing slopes of Varncombe Hill () were sold by Brighton Council with the rest of Saddlescombe Farm to the National Trust, but the Trust did not dedicate them as Access land, though they qualified and the National Trust had the power to do so.\nTo the east of Waterhall is Sweet Hill. The Hill has a flowery bank on its western slope (), a bushy lynchet and an old dewpond site on its brow. The Sussex Border Path takes you north to Pangdean Bottom and the Pyecombe parish. Pangdean Bottom is the west of the A23 and is rented by a tenant farmer from Brighton and Hove City Council, who have owned it since 1924. It includes ancient chalk grassland slopes where there are still chalkland flowers and butterflies. In late summer, the valley's north side has one of the largest populations of autumn ladies-tresses orchid has been recorded, together with a large population of the white variety of the self heal violet. The scrub at the head of the valley is old and diverse, with wayfaring tree, old man's beard, honeysuckle, hazel, and gorse.\nIn July 2021 the Sussex-based 'Landscapes of Freedom' group, together with Nick Hayes and Guy Shrubsole of the 'Right to Roam' network, organised a mass trespass in protest against the lack of public access to this valley and its management for game bird shooting, which has badly affected its chalk grassland wildlife. Over 300 people walked from Waterhall, Brighton, to Pangdean Bottom in protest. The public are actively discouraged from walking in the area and scrub has been allowed to grow on the pristine downland, whilst other parts have been ploughed out.\nTo the north of the city boundary in this area is the Pycombe parish.\nPatcham downland.\nThe Downland to the north of Patcham leads up to Ditchling Beacon and the western end of the Clayton to Offham Escarpment. Tegdown Hill is the next hill to the west of the downland Ditchling Road. A remarkable \"ring barrow\" survives () on its brow, together with the slight mounds of two other bowl barrows. Tegdown ring barrow has been described as \"probably the best of this type in the county\". It consists of a circular bank with a ditch and a flattish interior. It lies just south of a big dried up dew pond. From Tegdown you can see the three Iron Age camps of Hollingbury Castle, Ditchling Beacon, and the Devil's Dyke. To the north of the city boundary is the long Ditchling parish.\nThe Mid Sussex track of the Sussex Border Path starts at the A27 roundabout and the eastern track takes you up Ewebottom Hiil leaving Scare Hill to its west, passing the Chattri to the east and on to Holt Hill and the Pyecombe parish. The western track takes you to Waterhall across the A23.\nThose walking from Patcham towards Standean farm descend the hill into Ewe Bottom and have the pleasure of the intact, old Tegdown pastures to their right, where the steepest slope and the lynchets have fine chalk downland flowers. Opposite the slope is the mouth of Deep Bottom (), the southerly slope of which is a colourful old pasture site with abundant rockrose and which rises up to the Chattri. In autumn there are boletes and several old meadow waxcaps and a fairy club fungus.\nTo the south of the A27 and on the western edge of Patcham is Ladies Mile Down (), which has designated as a Local nature reserve. The area is a remarkable survival of plateau chalk grassland on Downland, where almost all such flattish sites have been destroyed by modern farming. The ancient turf has preserved lots of odd linear banks, which are surviving fragments of an Iron Age and Romano-British lynchetted field system. The banks once stretched across the line of the A27 bypass, beyond which one or two more fragments also survive. At the eastern end of the Down, is a Bronze Age burial mound recognisable as a low, grassy tump. The area is rich with summer flowers. Harebell, Sussex rampion flower, rockrose, and yellow rattle are enjoyed by locals here and at midsummer there are still good numbers of glowworms. Later in the summer months, the violet-blue of devil's-bit scabious and the powder-blue lesser scabious radiate.\nThe Chattri.\nThe Chattri () is a place of memorial and a destination for walks. It can be accessed from the Sussex Border Path to its west or by scrambling through the thickets of Deep Bottom. It is a solemn place where the bodies of First World War Indian Sikh and Hindu soldiers who died from wounds whilst being nursed at the Brighton Pavilion \"passed through the fire\", for this was their \"ghat\", or place of cremation. Its white Sicilian marble dome is in good condition, but the surrounding memorial garden is often unkept.\nHollingbury and Hollingdean.\nWhat is now considered to be Hollingbury is the slope facing west, east of Patcham and north of Fiveways. However, old Hollingbury was the crest of the hill by the hillfort, Hollingbury Park and even the east-facing slope. Until the 1930s the area was open downland with farms, small-holdings and piggeries. After World War Two, Hollingbury was used for a factory estate with the housing for the workforce.\nHollingdean is in the combe east of Ditchling Road and rising up to the north-facing slope to Roedale allotments, the golf course and hillfort. It is now mainly a residential area, with many council houses to the east and low-rise flats in the central part, with late 19th- and early 20th-century terraced houses towards Fiveways.\nHollingbury Castle, Hollingbury Woods, and Wild Park.\nThere is an oasis of undeveloped green space at the peak of the Down between Hollingbury, Hollingdean, and Coldean. At its centre is Hollingbury Castle or Hillfort ().This Iron Age hillfort is a scheduled ancient monument, of Iron Age date, whilst the four mounded round barrows within its ramparts are made by Bronze Age people, who held this place sacred. There are thickets of gorse which shine yellow in spring and are home to linnets and goldfinch. European stonechat is a familiar bird, too, and the rarer whinchat and redstart are seen regularly on passage to and from their breeding grounds. The soil within and around the camp has a layer of superficial acidity, with sorrel, bent-grass, and tormentil growing there.\nTo the south is Hollingbury Golf Course, the Roedale allotments and Hollingbury Park (). The park was originally part of the golf course. Its Edwardian pavilion was the original (circa 1908) clubhouse. East of the Park is the two-century-old Hollingbury Woods, now full of the rotting carcasses of beech giants toppled in the 1987 gale. It is a popular walk, with Fittleworth Stone walks, glades, and benches. It has received the loving care of a local \"Friends\" group for many years now.\nTo the west of Moulsecoombe is Wild Park (). The park is a valley/coombe which runs down from Hollingbury Castle and was opened in 1925. In the 1850s the valley, then known as Hollingbury Coombe, was one of the most famous of Sussex sites for lepidopterists (butterfly and moth experts), but dark green and silver-washed fritillary and silver-spotted skipper, once present in numbers, are rarely seen there now. Despite this, there are parts which are still rich in diversity and it is still good for butterflies. In spring one may still see the green hairstreak or orange-tip or find the wacky small bloody-nosed beetle and there are still adonis, chalkhill and common blues and brown argus and glowworms in midsummer. There are also orchids, harebells, sheets of rockrose, Sussex rampion, devil's-bit, and carline thistle. In autumn there are fungi too, including penny-bun bolete, collared earthstar, stinkhorn, and shaggy inkcap in the circling woods.\nColdean, Moulsecoomb, and Bevendean.\nColdean, Moulsecoomb, and Bevendean are suburbs developed by Brighton Corporation in the 1950s necessitated by the acute housing shortage in the area after World War II. The districts are all in beautiful downland areas.\nColdean occupies a deep valley on the historic boundary of Falmer and Stanmer parishes and is only separated from Hollingbury Hillfort by Wild Park. It has recently been approved to build over two hundred new homes in green land adjoining the South Downs and Stanmer Estate that ten years ago had been proposed to be a Local Nature Reserve.\nBevendean is in a valley nestled between Bevendean Down and Heath Hill.\nMoulsecoomb is on the other side of the Lewes Road and backs on to Falmer Hill, and is home to the University of Brighton's Moulsecoomb campus and Moulsecoomb Place. North of Moulsecoomb is the Falmer train station, University of Brighton's Falmer campus, and Falmer Stadium.\nStanmer village and Stanmer park.\nIn this area to the north east of Coldean are two further valleys. The first is occupied by Stanmer village (), a village with much historical value. The upper village street has eighteen flint cottages, with colourful gardens. The church was reconstructed in 1838, but the date of the original church can be guessed from the two huge and knotty yews in the churchyard. Next to the church is a pond, which although often unkempt, is probably the reason why Stanmer is so called, as \"stan mere\" is likely to derive from the Saxon \"stony pool\".:312 Between the church and the barn is a Tudor well 252 feet deep and a wooden donkey wheel, like that at Saddlescombe, contained within a flint well-house. The well was in use until mains water was installed in 1900.\nStanmer Woods were transformed in the 18th century after the Pelhams, later Earls of Chichester, had bought them. They planted a circle of woods along the hill-tops surrounding the dry valley in which the village lay and more shaws and clumps were scattered within. In 2007 the City Council took the initiative after the recent retirement of the Park's farming tenant and opened up all the closed woods and pasture fields to public access. The paths, gates and benches the council made are all popular with Brighton residents and beyond.\nThe largest plantation is called the Great Wood () and has acquired many of the plants of ancient woodland, some by planting and some have made their own way there. Under the council's control there has been much imaginative new planting too: \"The trees are laid out alphabetically, with Acer and Betula at the lower east end and Ulmus and Zelkova high up to the west\"., and on the lawns behind the House is a gigantic Blue Atlas Cedar with several slighter companions.\nThe next valley is occupied by the University of Sussex, which opened in 1961. In 2021, it is the place of study of over 16,000 students. The Brighton and Hove City border is surrounded by the large Falmer parish in this area.\nBevendean Down and Falmer Hill.\nBevendean Down () is a local nature reserve (LNR). Its hot, south-facing slopes and as a result is home to lizards and many butterflies. The area is well looked after by local people in cooperation with the tenant farmer and the Council rangers. There is a dew pond where swallows and house martins skim the water. Chalkhill and adonis blue and brown argus butterflies are found in numbers in the area. Hogtrough Bottom () has a mixture of taller grassland, short sheep's fescue turf, and scrub. On the shorter ground some years are large swarms of autumn ladies tresses. There are lots of scarce species such as bastard toadflax, waxcap, and webcap fungi, four-spot orb-weaver and purseweb spiders, but the tapestry of summer colours is the main delight which come from the purple knapweed and felwort, blue scabious, yellow hawkbit, and rockrose.\nOn the southern side of Bevendean is Heath Hill which runs up to Warren Road and two horse pasture smallholdings, Southdown Riding Stables () and Ingles\u00edde Stables to the east. Neither receive any agro-chemicals and consequently have gathered rich wildlife in the past half century. Swallows and swifts, bats and dung beetles, rooks and woodpecker and the hornet robberfly all survive on the rich supply of insects attracted by the pony dung. Both the farmsteads of Southdown's and Ingleside Stables are targeted for housing development within Brighton and Hove City Council's draft City Plan Part 2. The loss of these two farmsteads, which organise the grazing of these nature-rich pastures, would put them at risk. To the east of Heath Hill is Race Hill which is part of the Bevendean Down LNR. The Brighton Permaculture Trust has created a community orchard on Race Hill.\nFalmer Hill () gives great views across to Hollingbury Castle and Stanmer Park and the higher Downs beyond. The Hill's top remained unploughed till the last World War. It had a cluster of about ten probably Saxon barrows and a couple of round barrows. Nothing remains now except white smears of chalk and flint on the ploughed earth, where the barrows were. To the west of the Hill is City boundary which borders the Kingston near Lewes parish.\nKemptown, Whitehawk and Roedean.\nKemp Town is a district to east of Brighton. It was designed by Thomas Read Kemp (1782\u20131844). It includes the elegant Grade I listed buildings such as those of Sussex Square, Lewes Crescent, Arundel, and Chichester Terraces, and the less prestigious areas such as Rock Gardens to the east. The area includes the Royal Sussex Hospital. The beach south of Kemp Town is known as Black Rock. To the east of Kemp Town is Roedean gap. There is some housing and Roedean school, a public girls school that faces the sea.\nTo the north of Kemp Town is Whitehawk, a district of Brighton that has been built since 1931. On the saddle between Whitehawk Hill and Race Hill is Whitehawk Camp which is a Neolithic causewayed camp, one of eight causewayed camps known to have existed in the Sussex Downs. The camp is a scheduled ancient monument. To the northwest of Whitehawk is Brighton Race Course. Horse racing started on the Hill in the late 18th century next to the causewayed camp.\nWhitehawk Hill, Sheepcote Valley, and East Brighton Golf Course.\nWhitehawk Hill's lower slopes have large allotment sites, and there is a transmitting station on its top. To the north of the hilltop is the Neolithic Whitehawk Camp.\nTo the east of Whitehawk is Sheepcote Valley (). Here over are open to the public. In the 1870s there was a rifle range for volunteer soldiers sited here. The park was acquired in 1913 and laid out with plants and sports pitches in 1925. The northern part of the Valley served for many years as a municipal rubbish dump. When that purpose was completed, however, a kilometre and more of the upper Valley was terraced with six giant steps, which have now softened further with the cover of grass and low scrub. Now many birds breed in the area and many more pass through and stop extended periods on migration. Uncommon bird species are often seen there, such as rare warblers, wryneck, and redstarts. Sheepcote's lower valley has a caravan park where the first municipal site in the country was opened in 1938. There are playing fields embraced by the valley slopes and a caf\u00e9 in East Brighton Park.\nTo its east is East Brighton Golf Course () with extensive roughs, scrub thickets, and woodland. In winter, short-eared owls often reside in the area. Below the course is Roedean Bottom (). It sits between Roedean School and a pitch and putt golf course. On the east slope of the Bottom there is a little piece of aboriginal Downland turf, where in late summer autumn ladies tresses orchid grow, with carline thistle and hairy violet. Tiny moss snail in the turf demonstrates the site's antiquity. East again from the Golf Course (and southwest of Woodingdean) is Wick Bottom (). This peaceful dean takes its name from the medieval farm on the Falmer Road, now long-gone. The name 'wick' may denote a far more ancient, perhaps Roman, farmstead. In modern times it has been a place of arable stubbles, but there be a good array of chalk loving plants such as night flowering catchfly, henbit deadnettle, field madder, round-leaved fluellen, and common fumitory.\nWoodingdean, Ovingdean, and Rottingdean.\nOvingdean () is east of Brighton and slightly set back from the sea. It is a historic settlement that has existed since at least the Iron Age\nabout 600 BC. In ancient documents, the area is described as \"Ofamn-inge-denu\" or \"the valley of the enclosure of Ofa's people\". The Domesday book of 1086 records that the manor of 'hovingedene'. At that time the population of Ovingdean was about 90 people who included the lord of the manor and his family.\nBy 2020 there were nearer 1,200 inhabitants and many new buildings, but the old core of Ovingdean still exists and many flint walls, old cottages, barns (converted) and gentry houses have been retained. The Norman church of St Wulfran's is the oldest surviving building in the village and has lots of surviving early details. North of the church the stonewalled paddock is full of humps and hollows that mark where a Saxon thane had his manor house. To the south of the village in front of the sea is one of Blind Veterans UK's rehabilitation centres. On the beach is a cafe and beach for rock pooling at low tide.\nRottingdean is east of Ovingdean and has more history still. The first settled inhabitants of Rottingdean were the Neolithic people, arriving around 2500 BC. It later became famed for sea faring activities and primarily a centre for smuggling. Rottingdean is its own parish despite being with the Brighton and Hove boundary. Beacon Hill is a Local Nature Reserve (LNR) set up because of its pristine chalk grassland and archaeological features. A historic windmill is at the centre of the nature reserve. \nWoodingdean is north of Ovingdean and east of the Brighton Racecourse. It was extensively developed during the 1950s and 1960s when most of the roads in the north-eastern and southern ends of the village were built. The name Woodingdean came from Woodendean (i.e. wooded valley) Farm which was situated in the south end of what is now Ovingdean. This farm existed from before 1714 until 1979. Perhaps the earliest farming settlement to be identified in the area was situated in Wick Bottom. It was here that the Wick Farm, later Warren Farm was situated.\nEast Brighton downland and undercliff path.\nBetween the Brighton Marina and Saltdean is the undercliff path. It passes cafes at Ovingdean and Rottingdean. Many people use the path to walk, run or cycle either for amusement or to reach their destinations avoiding the up and down of the busy road above. The entire stretch of beach provides excellent home to rock pool loving species and sea and wading birds take advantage. Fulmars, peregrine falcons, ravens and rock pipits are just some of the bird life that nest in the chalk cliffs. This area is the only place on these southern cliffs that sea stock is native. Sea lavender also clings to the cliff ledges. Occasionally one can find samphire, too.\nTo the west of the Falmer Road from Woodingdean is Happy Valley (), a bushy, cattle-grazed slope with old Down pasture herbs, bits of gorse, and thorn. Further south is Mount Pleasant (). The west slope looks over Wick Bottom and is a small triangle of rich chalk grassland. It's rough and derelict, but special wildlife clings on. There's big swarms of Pride of Sussex rampion, dropwort, horseshoe vetch, and hairy violet. European stonechat frequent its thorn and bramble.\nJust east of Woodingdean, is the Bostle barrow field (). There is a cluster of at least twenty-seven small low grassy mounds, which are probably Saxon, and three larger, probably Bronze Age barrows on the top of the hill just south of the bridleway fence line. The barrow field is a 'precious fragment' of antiquity surrounded by agricultural fields. The Bostle combe slope () is an ancient Down pasture slope with the softest sheep's fescue turf, just south of the barrow field.\nEast a little further there is one of the most special natural sites in the Brighton area, Castle Hill (). The area is known for its early spider orchids, Roesel's bush-cricket, wart-biter grasshopper, and dramatic butterfly displays that include dark green fritillary, adonis blue, and thousands of chalkhill blues.\nThe Brighton and Hove boundary.\nFrom west to east the administrative boundary of Brighton and Hove begins on the coast at Gate 4 of Shoreham Port. It crosses the Southwick Ship Canal and the A259 between Brambledean Road and St Richard's Road in Portslade. From here, the border joins Eastbrook Road, and runs north up St Aubrey's Crescent. It then runs along the Sussex Border Path, through Fishersgate Station, separating Portslade from the neighbouring town of Southwick. Running west of Mile Oak, the border crosses the A27 skirting Mile Oak Farm and continues towards Devil's Dyke, before turning east over the Downs. The border then extends north from Tydell Farm to the outskirts of Pyecombe \u2013 its most northerly point. It crosses the A23 at the Patcham Pylons, which signifies the border for incoming traffic.\nContinuing east, the border runs north of the Chattri and Standean Farm, before crossing Ditchling Road at the Upper Lodges and running along the northerly limits of Stanmer Park and Stanmer Village. At this point, the border turns south and runs to the eastern edge of the University of Sussex campus, re-crossing the A27 along The Drove and passing east of Falmer Stadium. It continues along The Drove and Falmer Road to Woodingdean. Running north of Woodingdean, the border then heads southeast through Balsdean before adjoining to a footpath which enters Saltdean at the top of Longridge Avenue. The border runs down Longridge Avenue to the junction with Lynwood Road, where it turns south over houses and back across the A259 before returning the coastline at the eastern end of Saltdean Beach.\nGovernance.\nAs a unitary authority, Brighton and Hove City Council provides local government services, combining the functions of a non-metropolitan county and district council. Elections to the council are held every four years, with the most recent taking place in 2019. Councillors annually elect a Mayor of Brighton and Hove \u2013 a ceremonial position. The current mayor is Councillor Amanda Grimshaw. A proposal to introduce a directly elected mayor to the city was rejected by referendum in 2001. As a result, the council uses a cabinet system to form its executive. Jess Gibbons is the current chief executive. Both Brighton Town Hall in The Lanes, and Hove Town Hall on Church Road are used as meeting places for council.\nThe council was under Labour majority control until 2003, when it fell into no overall control until 2023. During this period the council has been controlled by minority administrations of all three major parties in Brighton and Hove: Labour, the Conservatives and the Greens. The first Green administration, elected in 2011, was the first time any Green Party had run a council in the UK, highlighting the city as the party's primary area of support. A Labour administration was elected in 2015, and the party narrowly retained a plurality in 2019, however expulsions from the Labour group led to the Greens regaining control of the administration in 2020. At the 2023 local elections, Labour regained control of the council. Bella Sankey is the current Leader of the council.\nThree constituencies cover Brighton and Hove in the UK Parliament. Hove is represented by Labour MP Peter Kyle. Brighton Pavilion, which covers central and northern Brighton, was represented by Green MP Caroline Lucas \u2013 the UK's first and, until 2024, only, MP from the Green Party. In 2024 Lucas stood down and was replaced by another member of the Green Party, Si\u00e2n Berry. Brighton Kemptown, which covers East Brighton, as well as areas outside of Brighton and Hove, such as Telscombe Cliffs and Peacehaven, is represented by Labour MP Chris Ward.\nEconomy and demography.\nThe economy of the city is service-based with a strong emphasis on creative, digital and electronic technologies. Tourism and entertainment are important sectors for the city, which has many hotels and amusements, as well as Brighton Pier and Shoreham/Portslade Harbour.\nThe United Kingdom Census 2011 showed a substantial fall in the proportion of the population claiming Jobseeker's Allowance or Income Support, from 10.1% of the resident population in 2001, to 4.5% of the resident population in 2011\".\"\nDemography.\nThe first census of Brighton was in 1801.\nThe resident population of Brighton and Hove at the 2011 census was 273,369 persons, 50% male and 50% female.\nThe 2011 census found the ethnic composition of Brighton and Hove to be 89.1% white (80.5% white British, 1.4% white Irish, 7.1% other white), 4.1% Asian (1.1% Chinese, 1.1% Indian, 0.5% Bangladeshi, 1.2% other Asian), 3.8% mixed race (1.5% mixed black/white, 1.2% mixed white/Asian, 1.0% other mix), 1.5% black, and 0.8% Arab.\nThe 2011 census found the religious composition to be 42.90% Christian, 42.42% nonreligious, 2.23% Muslim, 1.00% Buddhist, and 0.98% Jewish. 1.66% were adherents of some other religion, while 8.81% did not state their religion.\nIn the 2001 census, Brighton and Hove had the highest percentage of citizens indicating their religion as Jedi among all principal areas of England and Wales.\nFreedom of the City.\nThe following have received the Freedom of the City of Brighton and Hove.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This matter includes gas in ionic, atomic, and molecular form, as well as dust and cosmic rays. It fills interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium. The energy that occupies the same volume, in the form of electromagnetic radiation, is the interstellar radiation field. Although the density of atoms in the ISM is usually far below that in the best laboratory vacuums, the mean free path between collisions is short compared to typical interstellar lengths, so on these scales the ISM behaves as a gas (more precisely, as a plasma: it is everywhere at least slightly ionized), responding to electromagnetic radiation, and not as a collection of non-interacting particles.\nThe interstellar medium is composed of multiple phases distinguished by whether matter is ionic, atomic, or molecular, and the temperature and density of the matter. The interstellar medium is composed primarily of hydrogen, followed by helium with trace amounts of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen. The thermal pressures of these phases are in rough equilibrium with one another. Magnetic fields and turbulent motions also provide pressure in the ISM, and are typically more important, dynamically, than the thermal pressure. In the interstellar medium, matter is primarily in molecular form and reaches number densities of 1012 molecules per m3 (1 trillion molecules per m3). In hot, diffuse regions, gas is highly ionized, and the density may be as low as 100 ions per m3. Compare this with a number density of roughly 1025 molecules per m3 for air at sea level, and 1016 molecules per m3 (10 quadrillion molecules per m3) for a laboratory high-vacuum chamber. Within our galaxy, by mass, 99% of the ISM is gas in any form, and 1% is dust. Of the gas in the ISM, by number 91% of atoms are hydrogen and 8.9% are helium, with 0.1% being atoms of elements heavier than hydrogen or helium, known as \"metals\" in astronomical parlance. By mass this amounts to 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 1.5% heavier elements. The hydrogen and helium are primarily a result of primordial nucleosynthesis, while the heavier elements in the ISM are mostly a result of enrichment (due to stellar nucleosynthesis) in the process of stellar evolution.\nThe ISM plays a crucial role in astrophysics precisely because of its intermediate role between stellar and galactic scales. Stars form within the densest regions of the ISM, which ultimately contributes to molecular clouds and replenishes the ISM with matter and energy through planetary nebulae, stellar winds, and supernovae. This interplay between stars and the ISM helps determine the rate at which a galaxy depletes its gaseous content, and therefore its lifespan of active star formation.\n\"Voyager 1\" reached the ISM on August 25, 2012, making it the first artificial object from Earth to do so. Interstellar plasma and dust will be studied until the estimated mission end date of 2025. Its twin \"Voyager 2\" entered the ISM on November 5, 2018.\nInterstellar matter.\nTable 1 shows a breakdown of the properties of the components of the ISM of the Milky Way.\nThe three-phase model.\n put forward the static two \"phase\" equilibrium model to explain the observed properties of the ISM. Their modeled ISM included a cold dense phase (\"T\"\u00a0&lt;\u00a0300\u00a0K), consisting of clouds of neutral and molecular hydrogen, and a warm intercloud phase (\"T\"\u00a0~\u00a0104\u00a0K), consisting of rarefied neutral and ionized gas. added a dynamic third phase that represented the very hot (\"T\"\u00a0~\u00a0106\u00a0K) gas that had been shock heated by supernovae and constituted most of the volume of the ISM.\nThese phases are the temperatures where heating and cooling can reach a stable equilibrium. Their paper formed the basis for further study over the subsequent three decades. However, the relative proportions of the phases and their subdivisions are still not well understood.\nThe basic physics behind these phases can be understood through the behaviour of hydrogen, since this is by far the largest constituent of the ISM. The different phases are roughly in pressure balance over most of the Galactic disk, since regions of excess pressure will expand and cool, and likewise under-pressure regions will be compressed and heated. Therefore, since \"P = n k T\", hot regions (high \"T\") generally have low particle number density \"n\". Coronal gas has low enough density that collisions between particles are rare and so little radiation is produced, hence there is little loss of energy and the temperature can stay high for periods of hundreds of millions of years. In contrast, once the temperature falls to O(105 K) with correspondingly higher density, protons and electrons can recombine to form hydrogen atoms, emitting photons which take energy out of the gas, leading to runaway cooling. Left to itself this would produce the warm neutral medium. However, OB stars are so hot that some of their photons have energy greater than the Lyman limit, \"E\" &gt; 13.6 eV, enough to ionize hydrogen. Such photons will be absorbed by, and ionize, any neutral hydrogen atom they encounter, setting up a dynamic equilibrium between ionization and recombination such that gas close enough to OB stars is almost entirely ionized, with temperature around 8000 K (unless already in the coronal phase), until the distance where all the ionizing photons are used up. This \"ionization front\" marks the boundary between the Warm ionized and Warm neutral medium.\nOB stars, and also cooler ones, produce many more photons with energies below the Lyman limit, which pass through the ionized region almost unabsorbed. Some of these have high enough energy (&gt; 11.3 eV) to ionize carbon atoms, creating a C II (\"ionized carbon\") region outside the (hydrogen) ionization front. In dense regions this may also be limited in size by the availability of photons, but often such photons can penetrate throughout the neutral phase and only get absorbed in the outer layers of molecular clouds. Photons with \"E\" &gt; 4 eV or so can break up molecules such as H2 and CO, creating a photodissociation region (PDR) which is more or less equivalent to the Warm neutral medium. These processes contribute to the heating of the WNM. The distinction between Warm and Cold neutral medium is again due to a range of temperature/density in which runaway cooling occurs.\nThe densest molecular clouds have significantly higher pressure than the interstellar average, since they are bound together by their own gravity. When stars form in such clouds, especially OB stars, they convert the surrounding gas into the warm ionized phase, a temperature increase of several hundred. Initially the gas is still at molecular cloud densities, and so at vastly higher pressure than the ISM average: this is a classical H II region. The large overpressure causes the ionized gas to expand away from the remaining molecular gas (a Champagne flow), and the flow will continue until either the molecular cloud is fully evaporated or the OB stars reach the end of their lives, after a few millions years. At this point the OB stars explode as supernovas, creating blast waves in the warm gas that increase temperatures to the coronal phase (supernova remnants, SNR). These too expand and cool over several million years until they return to average ISM pressure.\nThe ISM in different kinds of galaxy.\nMost discussion of the ISM concerns spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, in which nearly all the mass in the ISM is confined to a relatively thin disk, typically with scale height about 100 parsecs (300 light years), which can be compared to a typical disk diameter of 30,000 parsecs. Gas and stars in the disk orbit the galactic centre with typical orbital speeds of 200\u00a0km/s. This is much faster than the random motions of atoms in the ISM, but since the orbital motion of the gas is coherent, the average motion does not directly affect structure in the ISM. The vertical scale height of the ISM is set in roughly the same way as the Earth's atmosphere, as a balance between the local gravitation field (dominated by the stars in the disk) and the pressure. Further from the disk plane, the ISM is mainly in the low-density warm and coronal phases, which extend at least several thousand parsecs away from the disk plane. This galactic halo or 'corona' also contains significant magnetic field and cosmic ray energy density.\nThe rotation of galaxy disks influences ISM structures in several ways. Since the angular velocity declines with increasing distance from the centre, any ISM feature, such as giant molecular clouds or magnetic field lines, that extend across a range of radius are sheared by differential rotation, and so tend to become stretched out in the tangential direction; this tendency is opposed by interstellar turbulence (see below) which tends to randomize the structures. Spiral arms are due to perturbations in the disk orbits - essentially ripples in the disk, that cause orbits to alternately converge and diverge, compressing and then expanding the local ISM. The visible spiral arms are the regions of maximum density, and the compression often triggers star formation in molecular clouds, leading to an abundance of H\u00a0II regions along the arms. Coriolis force also influences large ISM features.\nIrregular galaxies such as the Magellanic Clouds have similar interstellar mediums to spirals, but less organized. In elliptical galaxies the ISM is almost entirely in the coronal phase, since there is no coherent disk motion to support cold gas far from the center: instead, the scale height of the ISM must be comperable to the radius of the galaxy. This is consistent with the observation that there is little sign of current star formation in ellipticals. Some elliptical galaxies do show evidence for a small disk component, with ISM similar to spirals, buried close to their centers. The ISM of lenticular galaxies, as with their other properties, appear intermediate between spirals and ellipticals.\nVery close to the center of most galaxies (within a few hundred light years at most), the ISM is profoundly modified by the central supermassive black hole: see Galactic Center for the Milky Way, and Active galactic nucleus for extreme examples in other galaxies. The rest of this article will focus on the ISM in the disk plane of spirals, far from the galactic center.\nStructures.\nAstronomers describe the ISM as turbulent, meaning that the gas has quasi-random motions coherent over a large range of spatial scales. Unlike normal turbulence, in which the fluid motions are highly subsonic, the bulk motions of the ISM are usually larger than the sound speed. Supersonic collisions between gas clouds cause shock waves which compress and heat the gas, increasing the sounds speed so that the flow is locally subsonic; thus supersonic turbulence has been described as 'a box of shocklets', and is inevitably associated with complex density and temperature structure. In the ISM this is further complicated by the magnetic field, which provides wave modes such as Alfv\u00e9n waves which are often faster than pure sound waves: if turbulent speeds are supersonic but below the Alfv\u00e9n wave speed, the behaviour is more like subsonic turbulence.\nStars are born deep inside large complexes of molecular clouds, typically a few parsecs in size. During their lives and deaths, stars interact physically with the ISM.\nStellar winds from young clusters of stars (often with giant or supergiant HII regions surrounding them) and shock waves created by supernovae inject enormous amounts of energy into their surroundings, which leads to hypersonic turbulence. The resultant structures \u2013 of varying sizes \u2013 can be observed, such as stellar wind bubbles and superbubbles of hot gas, seen by X-ray satellite telescopes or turbulent flows observed in radio telescope maps.\nStars and planets, once formed, are unaffected by pressure forces in the ISM, and so do not take part in the turbulent motions, although stars formed in molecular clouds in a galactic disk share their general orbital motion around the galaxy center. Thus stars are usually in motion relative to their surrounding ISM. The Sun is currently traveling through the Local Interstellar Cloud, an irregular clump of the warm neutral medium a few parsecs across, within the low-density Local Bubble, a 100-parsec radius region of coronal gas.\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the space beyond the Solar System as detected by the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" space probes. According to the researchers, this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the VLISM (very local interstellar medium) in the general direction of the heliospheric nose\".\nInteraction with interplanetary medium.\nThe interstellar medium begins where the interplanetary medium of the Solar System ends. The solar wind slows to subsonic velocities at the termination shock, 90\u2013100 astronomical units from the Sun. In the region beyond the termination shock, called the heliosheath, interstellar matter interacts with the solar wind. \"Voyager 1\", the farthest human-made object from the Earth (after 1998), crossed the termination shock December 16, 2004 and later entered interstellar space when it crossed the heliopause on August 25, 2012, providing the first direct probe of conditions in the ISM .\nInterstellar extinction.\nDust grains in the ISM are responsible for extinction and reddening, the decreasing light intensity and shift in the dominant observable wavelengths of light from a star. These effects are caused by scattering and absorption of photons and allow the ISM to be observed with the naked eye in a dark sky. The apparent rifts that can be seen in the band of the Milky Way \u2013 a uniform disk of stars \u2013 are caused by absorption of background starlight by dust in molecular clouds within a few thousand light years from Earth. This effect decreases rapidly with increasing wavelength (\"reddening\" is caused by greater absorption of blue than red light), and becomes almost negligible at mid-infrared wavelengths (&gt;\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcm).\nExtinction provides one of the best ways of mapping the three-dimensional structure of the ISM, especially since the advent of accurate distances to millions of stars from the \"Gaia\" mission. The total amount of dust in front of each star is determined from its reddening, and the dust is then located along the line of sight by comparing the dust column density in front of stars projected close together on the sky, but at different distances. By 2022 it was possible to generate a map of ISM structures within 3\u00a0kpc (10,000 light years) of the Sun.\nFar ultraviolet light is absorbed effectively by the neutral hydrogen gas in the ISM. Specifically, atomic hydrogen absorbs very strongly at about 121.5 nanometers, the Lyman-alpha transition, and also at the other Lyman series lines. Therefore, it is nearly impossible to see light emitted at those wavelengths from a star farther than a few hundred light years from Earth, because most of it is absorbed during the trip to Earth by intervening neutral hydrogen. All photons with wavelength &lt;\u00a091.6\u00a0nm, the Lyman limit, can ionize hydrogen and are also very strongly absorbed. The absorption gradually decreases with increasing photon energy, and the ISM begins to become transparent again in soft X-rays, with wavelengths shorter than about 1\u00a0nm.\nHeating and cooling.\nThe ISM is usually far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Collisions establish a Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution of velocities, and the 'temperature' normally used to describe interstellar gas is the 'kinetic temperature', which describes the temperature at which the particles would have the observed Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann velocity distribution in thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the interstellar radiation field is typically much weaker than a medium in thermodynamic equilibrium; it is most often roughly that of an A star (surface temperature of ~10,000 K) highly diluted. Therefore, bound levels within an atom or molecule in the ISM are rarely populated according to the Boltzmann formula .\nDepending on the temperature, density, and ionization state of a portion of the ISM, different heating and cooling mechanisms determine the temperature of the gas.\nHeating mechanisms.\nGrain heating by thermal exchange is very important in supernova remnants where densities and temperatures are very high.\nGas heating via grain-gas collisions is dominant deep in giant molecular clouds (especially at high densities). Far infrared radiation penetrates deeply due to the low optical depth. Dust grains are heated via this radiation and can transfer thermal energy during collisions with the gas. A measure of efficiency in the heating is given by the accommodation coefficient:\nformula_1\nwhere \"T\" is the gas temperature, \"Td\" the dust temperature, and \"T\"2 the post-collision temperature of the gas atom or molecule. This coefficient was measured by as \"\u03b1\"\u00a0=\u00a00.35.\n* Gravitational collapse of a cloud\n* Supernova explosions\n* Stellar winds\n* Expansion of H\u00a0II regions\n* Magnetohydrodynamic waves created by supernova remnants\nObservations of the ISM.\nDespite its extremely low density, photons generated in the ISM are prominent in nearly all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. In fact the optical band, on which astronomers relied until well into the 20th century, is the one in which the ISM is least obvious.\nRadiowave propagation.\nRadio waves are affected by the plasma properties of the ISM. The lowest frequency radio waves, below \u2248 0.1\u00a0MHz, cannot propagate through the ISM since they are below its plasma frequency. At higher frequencies, the plasma has a significant refractive index, decreasing with increasing frequency, and also dependent on the density of free electrons. Random variations in the electron density cause interstellar scintillation, which broadens the apparent size of distant radio sources seen through the ISM, with the broadening decreasing with frequency squared. The variation of refractive index with frequency causes the arrival times of pulses from pulsars and Fast radio bursts to be delayed at lower frequencies (dispersion). The amount of delay is proportional to the column density of free electrons (Dispersion measure, DM), which is useful for both mapping the distribution of ionized gas in the Galaxy and estimating distances to pulsars (more distant ones have larger DM).\nA second propagation effect is Faraday rotation, which affects linearly polarized radio waves, such as those produced by synchrotron radiation, one of the most common sources of radio emission in astrophysics. Faraday rotation depends on both the electron density and the magnetic field strength, and so is used as a probe of the interstellar magnetic field.\nThe ISM is generally very transparent to radio waves, allowing unimpeded observations right through the disk of the Galaxy. There are a few exceptions to this rule. The most intense spectral lines in the radio spectrum can become opaque, so that only the surface of the line-emitting cloud is visible. This mainly affects the carbon monoxide lines at millimetre wavelengths that are used to trace molecular clouds, but the 21-cm line from neutral hydrogen can become opaque in the cold neutral medium. Such absorption only affects photons at the line frequencies: the clouds are otherwise transparent. The other significant absorption process occurs in dense ionized regions. These emit photons, including radio waves, via thermal bremsstrahlung. At short wavelengths, typically microwaves, these are quite transparent, but their brightness approaches the black body limit as formula_2, and at wavelengths long enough that this limit is reached, they become opaque. Thus metre-wavelength observations show H\u00a0II regions as cool spots blocking the bright background emission from Galactic synchrotron radiation, while at decametres the entire galactic plane is absorbed, and the longest radio waves observed, 1\u00a0km, can only propagate 10-50 parsecs through the Local Bubble. The frequency at which a particular nebula becomes optically thick depends on its \"emission measure\"\nformula_3\nthe column density of squared electron number density. Exceptionally dense nebulae can become optically thick at centimetre wavelengths: these are just-formed and so both rare and small ('Ultra-compact H\u00a0II regions')\nThe general transparency of the ISM to radio waves, especially microwaves, may seem surprising since radio waves at frequencies &gt; 10\u00a0GHz are significantly attenuated by Earth's atmosphere (as seen in the figure). But the column density through the atmosphere is vastly larger than the column through the entire Galaxy, due to the extremely low density of the ISM.\nHistory of knowledge of interstellar space.\nThe word 'interstellar' (between the stars) was coined by Francis Bacon in the context of the ancient theory of a literal sphere of fixed stars. Later in the 17th century, when the idea that stars were scattered through infinite space became popular, it was debated whether that space was a true vacuum or filled with a hypothetical fluid, sometimes called \"aether\", as in Ren\u00e9 Descartes' vortex theory of planetary motions. While vortex theory did not survive the success of Newtonian physics, an invisible luminiferous aether was re-introduced in the early 19th century as the medium to carry light waves; e.g., in 1862 a journalist wrote: \"this efflux occasions a thrill, or vibratory motion, in the ether which fills the interstellar spaces.\"\nIn 1864, William Huggins used spectroscopy to determine that a nebula is made of gas. Huggins had a private observatory with an 8-inch telescope, with a lens by Alvan Clark; but it was equipped for spectroscopy, which enabled breakthrough observations.\nFrom around 1889, Edward Barnard pioneered deep photography of the sky, finding many 'holes in the Milky Way'. At first he compared them to sunspots, but by 1899 was prepared to write: \"One can scarcely conceive a vacancy with holes in it, unless there is nebulous matter covering these apparently vacant places in which holes might occur\". These holes are now known as dark nebulae, dusty molecular clouds silhouetted against the background star field of the galaxy; the most prominent are listed in his Barnard Catalogue. The first direct detection of cold diffuse matter in interstellar space came in 1904, when Johannes Hartmann observed the binary star Mintaka (Delta Orionis) with the Potsdam Great Refractor. Hartmann reported that absorption from the \"K\" line of calcium appeared \"extraordinarily weak, but almost perfectly sharp\" and also reported the \"quite surprising result that the calcium line at 393.4\u00a0nanometres does not share in the periodic displacements of the lines caused by the orbital motion of the spectroscopic binary star\". The stationary nature of the line led Hartmann to conclude that the gas responsible for the absorption was not present in the atmosphere of the star, but was instead located within an isolated cloud of matter residing somewhere along the line of sight to this star. This discovery launched the study of the interstellar medium.\nInterstellar gas was further confirmed by Slipher in 1909, and then by 1912 interstellar dust was confirmed by Slipher. Interstellar sodium was detected by Mary Lea Heger in 1919 through the observation of stationary absorption from the atom's \"D\" lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nanometres towards Delta Orionis and Beta Scorpii.\nIn the series of investigations, Viktor Ambartsumian introduced the now commonly accepted notion that interstellar matter occurs in the form of clouds.\nSubsequent observations of the \"H\" and \"K\" lines of calcium by revealed double and asymmetric profiles in the spectra of Epsilon and Zeta Orionis. These were the first steps in the study of the very complex interstellar sightline towards Orion. Asymmetric absorption line profiles are the result of the superposition of multiple absorption lines, each corresponding to the same atomic transition (for example the \"K\" line of calcium), but occurring in interstellar clouds with different radial velocities. Because each cloud has a different velocity (either towards or away from the observer/Earth), the absorption lines occurring within each cloud are either blue-shifted or red-shifted (respectively) from the lines' rest wavelength through the Doppler Effect. These observations confirming that matter is not distributed homogeneously were the first evidence of multiple discrete clouds within the ISM.\nThe growing evidence for interstellar material led to comment: \"While the interstellar absorbing medium may be simply the ether, yet the character of its selective absorption, as indicated by Kapteyn, is characteristic of a gas, and free gaseous molecules are certainly there, since they are probably constantly being expelled by the Sun and stars.\"\nThe same year, Victor Hess's discovery of cosmic rays, highly energetic charged particles that rain onto the Earth from space, led others to speculate whether they also pervaded interstellar space. The following year, the Norwegian explorer and physicist Kristian Birkeland wrote: \"It seems to be a natural consequence of our points of view to assume that the whole of space is filled with electrons and flying electric ions of all kinds. We have assumed that each stellar system in evolutions throws off electric corpuscles into space. It does not seem unreasonable therefore to think that the greater part of the material masses in the universe is found, not in the solar systems or nebulae, but in 'empty' space\" .\n noted that \"it could scarcely have been believed that the enormous gaps between the stars are completely void. Terrestrial aurorae are not improbably excited by charged particles emitted by the Sun. If the millions of other stars are also ejecting ions, as is undoubtedly true, no absolute vacuum can exist within the galaxy.\"\nIn September 2012, NASA scientists reported that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), subjected to \"interstellar medium (ISM)\" conditions, are transformed, through hydrogenation, oxygenation and hydroxylation, to more complex organics, \"a step along the path toward amino acids and nucleotides, the raw materials of proteins and DNA, respectively\". Further, as a result of these transformations, the PAHs lose their spectroscopic signature, which could be one of the reasons \"for the lack of PAH detection in interstellar ice grains, particularly the outer regions of cold, dense clouds or the upper molecular layers of protoplanetary disks.\"\nIn February 2014, NASA announced a greatly upgraded database for tracking polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the universe. According to scientists, more than 20% of the carbon in the universe may be associated with PAHs, possible starting materials for the formation of life. PAHs seem to have been formed shortly after the Big Bang, are widespread throughout the universe, and are associated with new stars and exoplanets.\nIn April 2019, scientists, working with the Hubble Space Telescope, reported the confirmed detection of the large and complex ionized molecules of buckminsterfullerene (C60) (also known as \"buckyballs\") in the interstellar medium spaces between the stars.\nIn September 2020, evidence was presented of solid-state water in the interstellar medium, and particularly, of water ice mixed with silicate grains in cosmic dust grains.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Their home ground has been Falmer Stadium since 2011, having played at the Goldstone Ground for most of the 20th century.\nFounded in 1901, Brighton played their early professional football in the Southern League. They were later elected to the Football League in 1920. Between 1979 and 1983, they played in the First Division, and reached the 1983 FA Cup final, losing to Manchester United after a replay. They were relegated from the First Division in the same season.\nBy the late 1990s, Brighton were in the fourth tier of English football and having financial problems. After narrowly avoiding relegation from the Football League to the Conference in 1997, a boardroom takeover saved the club from liquidation. Successive promotions in 2001 and 2002 brought Brighton back to the second tier, and in 2011, the club moved into the Falmer Stadium after 14 years without a permanent home ground. In the 2016\u201317 season, Brighton finished second in the EFL Championship and were thus promoted to the Premier League, ending a 34-year absence from the top flight. In the 2022\u201323 season, Brighton finished sixth in the Premier League, their highest top flight finish ever, and qualified for the UEFA Europa League; their first participation in European club football.\nBrighton are nicknamed \"the Seagulls\" and have played in blue-and-white striped shirts for most of their history. The club's fiercest and longest-standing rivalry is with Crystal Palace, which emerged in the 1970s for competitive reasons.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1901\u20131972).\nBrighton &amp; Hove Albion F.C. were founded in 1901 and 19 years later, in 1920, they were elected to the Football League's new Third Division \u2013 having previously been members of the Southern League. In the Southern League they won their only national honour to date, the FA Charity Shield, which at that time was contested by the champions of the Southern League, and the Football League, by defeating Football League champions Aston Villa in 1910. Following their switch to the regionalised Third Division South in 1921, they remained in this division until the 1957\u20131958 season, when they won the title, securing promotion to the Second Division at the same time as the regionalised North and South divisions merged into a national Third and Fourth Division for the 1958\u20131959 season. Albion retained their second tier status until relegation in 1962, suffering a successive relegation in 1963 and slipping into the Fourth Division for the first time. They won the Fourth Division title in 1964\u20131965 and remained in the Third Division until 1972 when as runners up they secured promotion back to the Second Division.\nMike Bamber years (1972\u20131987).\nMike Bamber was the chairman of Brighton from October 1972 until 1983. He famously brought Brian Clough to the club in 1973 and later appointed former England player Alan Mullery as manager. Brighton's life as a Football League club had brought little in the way of success and headlines until 1979, when, under Mullery's management, they were promoted to the First Division as Second Division runners-up. The 1982/83 season saw an inconsistent start for the club, with victories over Arsenal and Manchester United mixed in with heavy defeats. Manager Mike Bailey eventually lost his job at the start of December 1982. Jimmy Melia took over as manager, but was unable to turn the situation around and Brighton, after four seasons in the top flight, were relegated in 1983, finishing in last place.\nDespite their relegation, that season Brighton reached their first FA Cup final and drew 2\u20132 with Manchester United in the first match. Brighton's goals were scored by Gordon Smith and Gary Stevens. The final featured an infamous \"miss\" by Gordon Smith with the last kick of the game in extra time, prompting the BBC commentator Peter Jones to utter the well-known phrase \"...and Smith must score\". Smith's kick was saved by the Manchester United goalkeeper, Gary Bailey. In the replay, Manchester United won 4\u20130.\nRelegation, last years, and saved by Knight (1987\u20131997).\nAfter four seasons, relegation to Division Three came in 1987, but the Albion were promoted back the next season. In 1991 they lost the play-off final at Wembley to Notts County 3\u20131, only to be relegated the next season to the newly named Division Two. In 1996 further relegation came to Division Three. The club's financial situation was becoming increasingly precarious, and the club's directors decided that the Goldstone Ground would have to be sold to pay off some of the club's large debts. Manager Jimmy Case was sacked, after a very poor start to the 1996\u201397 season left Brighton at the bottom of the league by a considerable margin. The club's directors appointed Steve Gritt, the former joint manager of Charlton Athletic, as manager\u2014Gritt was relatively unknown. Brighton's league performance steadily improved under Gritt, although their improving chances of survival were put under further threat by a two-point deduction by the Football Association, imposed as punishment for a pitch invasion by fans who were protesting against the sale of the Goldstone ground. A lifelong fan named Dick Knight took control of the club in 1997 having led the fan pressure to oust the previous board following their sale of the club's Goldstone Ground to property developers.\nBy the last day of the season, after being 13 points adrift at one stage, they had risen from the bottom of the table and had to play the team directly below them, Hereford United, to avoid relegation from the league. If Brighton won or drew, they would be safe. Brighton defender Kerry Mayo scored an own goal in the first half, and it appeared that Brighton's 77-year league career was over. But a late goal from Robbie Reinelt ensured that Brighton retained their league status, based on number of goals scored (despite Hereford having a better goal difference as, in the Football League at the time, goals scored took precedence), and Hereford's 25-year league run was instead over.\nWithdean era and Bloom takeover (1997\u20132011).\nThe sale of the Goldstone Ground went through in 1997, leading to Brighton having to play some 70 miles away at Gillingham's Priestfield stadium for two seasons. Micky Adams was appointed Brighton's manager in 1999. For the start of the 1999\u20132000 season the Seagulls secured a lease to play home games at Withdean Stadium, a converted athletics track in Brighton owned by the local council. 2000\u201301 was Brighton's first successful season for 13 years. They were crowned champions of Division Three and promoted to Division Two. Adams left in October 2001 to work as Dave Bassett's assistant at Leicester, being replaced by former Leicester manager Peter Taylor. The transition proved to be a plus point for Brighton, who maintained their good form and ended the season as Division Two champions \u2013 winning a second successive promotion. Just five years after almost succumbing to the double threat of losing their Football League status and going out of business completely, Brighton were one division away from the Premier League.\nIn May 2009, Knight was replaced as chairman at Brighton by Tony Bloom, who successfully secured \u00a393\u00a0million funding for the new Falmer Stadium and 75% shareholding at the club.\nBrighton's final season at Withdean was 2010\u201311, in which they won League One under the management of Gus Poyet. The following season, Brighton changed their crest to a design similar to the crest used from the 1970s to the 1990s. This was to reflect on the club returning home after not having a stadium since 1997.\nMove to new stadium and promotion under Hughton (2011\u20132017).\nThe Falmer Stadium hosted its first league match on the opening day of the 2011\u201312 season against Doncaster Rovers, who were the last opposition to play at the Goldstone in 1997. The game finished 2\u20131 to Brighton. The 2012\u201313 season saw Brighton finish 4th and lose in the play-off semi-finals to Crystal Palace. Poyet was suspended as manager following controversial comments made in his post-match interview, and was later sacked as manager and replaced by \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda.\nOn the final day of the 2013\u201314 season, Brighton beat Nottingham Forest 2\u20131 with a last minute winner from Leonardo Ulloa to secure a 6th-place finish. After losing to Derby County in the play-offs semi-finals, Garc\u00eda resigned. Sami Hyypi\u00e4 was appointed manager for the 2014\u201315 season but resigned after just four months due to a poor run of results, replaced by Chris Hughton. In the following campaign Brighton challenged for promotion again, buoyed by a 21-game unbeaten run from the opening day to 19 December. On the final day of the season Brighton travelled to Middlesbrough and needed to win to secure promotion to the Premier League, but a 1\u20131 draw meant 3rd and a play-off place, where defeat to Sheffield Wednesday was Brighton's third playoff semi-final defeat in four seasons. Midfielder Beram Kayal, who joined from Celtic in January 2015, was voted the club\u2019s Player of the Season for 2015\u201316 and contributed to Brighton\u2019s promotion push and subsequent Premier League survival campaigns.\nBrighton started 2016\u201317 with an 18-match unbeaten run, taking them to the top of the league for much of December and January. They remained in the automatic promotion positions for most of the rest of the season, and clinched promotion to the Premier League after a 2\u20131 win against Wigan Athletic at home on 17 April 2017.\nBack in the top division (2017\u2013present).\nBrighton's first season in the Premier League was largely successful, with the club rising into the top half several times in the season. After being one point above the relegation zone in January, victories over Arsenal and Manchester United in the final months of the campaign helped secure a 15th place finish.\nThe club endured a difficult second season in the top division, narrowly avoiding relegation with a 17th-place finish. In the FA Cup, Brighton reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1983, losing 1\u20130 to Manchester City. Hughton was sacked following the end of the season due to the poor run of results.\nFollowing Hughton's sacking, Swansea City manager Graham Potter was appointed as the new head coach on a four-year contract. Potter extended his contract by two more years in November 2019. From March to June 2020, the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Brighton finished 15th and 16th in Potter's first two seasons, securing a historic fifth season in the Premier League in May 2021 that ensured their current spell in the top flight exceeded their previous run from 1979 to 1983.\nThe club's 2021\u201322 season saw a ninth-place finish in the Premier League, the highest Brighton had ever finished in English top flight football, with a record tally of 51 points. In September 2022, Potter left the club to become head coach of Chelsea, following the dismissal of Thomas Tuchel.\nOn 18 September 2022, Brighton announced Roberto De Zerbi as the club's new head coach. The league season was paused for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, in which Brighton midfielder Alexis Mac Allister played an important role in Argentina's victory in the tournament including starting and assisting in the final. Brighton reached their second FA Cup semi-final in four seasons, losing on penalties to Manchester United following a 0\u20130 draw. On 21 May 2023, Brighton qualified for European football for the first time in their history with a 3\u20131 victory over Southampton. Three days later, after a 1\u20131 draw with Manchester City, Brighton secured qualification for the group stage of the 2023\u201324 UEFA Europa League. Brighton finished the season in sixth-place with a record tally of 62 points.\nOn 14 December 2023, Brighton topped their UEFA Europa League group, qualifying for the round of 16 after defeating Marseille 1\u20130. Brighton would be eliminated in the round of 16 by Roma in a 4\u20131 aggregate loss on 14 March 2024. On 18 May 2024, Brighton and De Zerbi mutually agreed to end his contract at the end of the 2023\u201324 season as Brighton fell to 11th on the final day of the season with 48 points, leapfrogged by their arch rivals Crystal Palace on goal difference after being ahead all season.\nIn June 2024, De Zerbi was replaced by Fabian H\u00fcrzeler who became the youngest permanent manager in Premier League history at 31 years old. H\u00fcrzeler had been manager of FC St. Pauli, where he led the team to promotion back to the top tier of German football after a 13-year absence. His first official match in charge of Brighton was on August 17, 2024, against Everton. Brighton won the match 3\u20130. Brighton finished the 2024\u201325 season in 8th place.\nStadium.\nGoldstone Ground.\nFor 95 years Brighton and Hove Albion were located at the Goldstone Ground in Hove, until the board of directors decided to sell the stadium. The sale, implemented by majority shareholder Bill Archer and his chief executive David Bellotti, proved controversial, and the move provoked widespread protests against the board. The club received little if any money from this sale.\nIn their last season at the Goldstone, 1996\u201397, the Seagulls were in danger of relegation from the Football League. They won their final game at the Goldstone against Doncaster Rovers, setting up a winner-takes-all relegation game at Hereford United, who were level on points with the Seagulls. Brighton drew 1\u20131, and Hereford were relegated to the Football Conference on goals scored.\nWithdean Stadium.\nFor two years, from 1997 to 1999, the club shared Priestfield Stadium, the ground of Gillingham, before returning to Brighton to play at Withdean Stadium. This is not predominantly a football ground, having been used for athletics throughout most of its history, and previously as a zoo.\nBecause of the cost of the public enquiry into planning permission for a new stadium, rent on Withdean Stadium, fees paid to use Gillingham's Priestfield Stadium, and a general running deficit due to the low ticket sales inherent with a small ground, the club had an accumulated deficit of \u00a39.5\u00a0million in 2004. The board of directors paid \u00a37\u00a0million of this; the other \u00a32.5\u00a0million had to be raised from the operations of the club. In an effort to achieve this, a fund-raising appeal known as the \"Alive and Kicking Fund\" was started, with everything from nude Christmas Cards featuring the players to a CD single being released to raise cash. On 9 January 2005 this fund-raising single 'Tom Hark' went straight in at number 17 in the UK chart, gaining it national airplay on BBC Radio 1.\nFalmer Stadium.\nThe club's home ground is Falmer Stadium, located in Village Way, Brighton.\nOn 28 October 2005, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister announced that the application for Falmer had been successful. Lewes District Council contested John Prescott's decision to approve planning permission for Falmer, forcing a judicial review. This was based on a minor error in Prescott's original approval which neglected to state that some car parking for the stadium is in the Lewes district as opposed to the Brighton &amp; Hove unitary authority. This caused further delay. Once the judicial review ruled in favour of the stadium, Lewes District Council said that it would not launch any further appeals.\nBuilding of Falmer Stadium started in December 2008. On 31 May 2011 the club officially completed the handover and was given the keys to the stadium with an initial capacity of 22,374 seats, signifying the end of 14 years without a designated home. During January 2012, the club submitted an application to Brighton and Hove City council to increase the stadium capacity by a further 8,000 seats as well as to add additional corporate boxes, new television facilities and a luxury suite. This was granted unanimously by Brighton &amp; Hove City Council's planning committee on 25 April 2012. The stadium was then expanded to 27,250 for the start of the 2012\u201313 season and then further to 27,750 during December 2012 before reaching 30,750 during May 2013.\nIn 2020, the club submitted plans to expand the stadium from 30,750 seats to 32,500 including additional hospitality. In 2021, the stadium was expanded to 31,800 with additional works yet to be done.\nColours and kits.\nFor most of Brighton's history they have played in blue and white shirts, usually striped, with different combinations of white and blue shorts and socks, though this changed to all white briefly in the 1970s and again to plain royal blue in the early 1980s.\nKit manufacturers and sponsors.\nSince 2014, the club's kit has been manufactured by Nike. Previous manufacturers include Bukta (1971\u201374, 1977\u201380), Admiral (1974\u201375, 1994\u201397), Umbro (1975\u201377), Adidas (1980\u201387), Spall (1987\u201389), Sports Express (1989\u201391), Ribero (1991\u201394), Superleague (1997\u201399), and Erre\u00e0 (1999\u20132014).\nTheir current shirt sponsors are American Express. Previous sponsors have included British Caledonian Airways (1980\u201383), Phoenix Brewery (1983\u201386), NOBO (1986\u201391), TSB Bank (1991\u201393), Sandtex (1993\u201398), Donatello (1998\u201399), Skint Records (1999\u20132008), IT First (2008\u201311), and BrightonandHoveJobs.com (2011\u201313). Their current sleeve sponsors are Experience Kissimmee. Previous sleeve sponsors include JD Sports, and Snickers UK.\nRivalries.\nEven though the two clubs are almost apart, Crystal Palace are Brighton's main rival, dating back to the 1970s and hostility between managers Alan Mullery and Terry Venables, who took charge of Brighton and Palace respectively in 1976 ahead of a close season in the Third Division which saw the two teams vying with Mansfield Town. The season finished with both Palace and Brighton beaten to the title by Mansfield; however both sides were promoted and the hostility between the two managers had forged an intense rivalry between both teams. This continued into the following season in the Second Division as Brighton, who had finished their season at the top, fell into second after Palace won a previously postponed game against Burnley the following weekend to beat Brighton to the title by one point. In addition, the A23 road runs directly between Brighton and Croydon, where Palace's Selhurst Park stadium is based. This has led to the media labelling the rivalry as both the A23 and M23 derby, although fans of both clubs do not use this term.\nSituated in East Sussex, Brighton find themselves isolated from most other teams, leaving them without an established local derby. Matches against fellow south coast outfits Southampton and Portsmouth are occasionally labelled as local derbies by the media, but most fans of either team do not consider the other to be their rivals due to the over distance between the clubs, and the already well-established rivalry between Southampton and Portsmouth.\n \"As of 29 October 2025\"\nPlayers.\nFirst-team squad.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnder 21s and academy.\nThe Under-21s and Academy are the youth teams of Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.

{"id": "69458", "revid": "2628316", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69458", "title": "Pacific Coast League", "text": "AAA baseball league in the Western US\nThe Pacific Coast League (PCL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the Western United States. Along with the International League, it is one of two leagues playing at the Triple-A level, which is one grade below Major League Baseball (MLB). \nThe PCL was one of the premier regional baseball leagues in the first half of the 20th century. Although it was never recognized as a true major league, to which it aspired, its quality of play was considered very high. A number of top stars of the era, including Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams, were products of the league. In 1958, with the arrival of major league teams on the west coast and the availability of televised major league games, the PCL's modern era began with each team signing Player Development Contracts to become farm teams of major league clubs. Following MLB's reorganization of the minor leagues in 2021, it operated as the Triple-A West for one season before switching back to its previous moniker in 2022.\nA league champion is determined at the end of each season. The San Francisco Seals won 14 Pacific Coast League titles, the most in the league's history, followed by the Los Angeles Angels (12) and the Albuquerque Dukes and Portland Beavers (8).\nHistory.\nFormation and early history.\nThe Pacific Coast League was formed on December 29, 1902, when officials from the California State League (1899\u20131902) met in San Francisco for the purpose of expanding the league beyond California. Six franchises were granted. These were the Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Oaks, Portland Beavers, Sacramento Senators, San Francisco Seals, and Seattle Indians. A dispute over territories owned by the Pacific Northwest League, in which the PCL had placed franchises, and the PCL's allowing blacklisted players to compete led to the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (NAPBL) labeling the PCL as an outlaw league.\nThe mild climate of the West Coast, especially California, allowed the league to play longer seasons, sometimes starting in late February and ending as late as the beginning of December. During the 1905 season the San Francisco Seals set the all-time PCL record by playing 230 games. Teams regularly played between 170 and 200 games in a season until the late 1950s. This allowed players, who were often career minor leaguers, to hone their skills, earn an extra month or two of pay, and reduce the need to find off-season work. These longer seasons gave owners the opportunity to generate more revenue. Another outcome was that a number of the all-time minor league records for season statistical totals are held by players from the PCL.\nThe inaugural 1903 season, which consisted of over 200 scheduled games for each team, began on March 26. The Los Angeles Angels finished the season in first place with a 133\u201378 (.630) record, making them the first league champions.\nIn 1904, NAPBL president Patrick T. Powers brokered terms with the PCL, clearing it of its outlaw status and designating it as a Class A league. In 1909, the league classification was raised to Double-A. In 1919, with the earlier addition of the Salt Lake City Bees and Vernon Tigers, league membership reached eight teams for the first time. While the league had experienced little commercial success up to this point, the 1920s were a turning point which saw increased attendance and teams fielding star players.\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s resulted in a lower quality of play due to the league's salary reduction. Still, a number of top stars, including Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Bobby Doerr, and Ox Eckhardt, competed on PCL teams that decade. Also helping attendance was the introduction of night games. At Sacramento's Moreing Field, the Sacramento Solons and the Oakland Oaks played the first night baseball game, five years before any major league night game, on June 10, 1930. The Hollywood Stars and San Diego Padres were added to the league in the 1930s as well.\nA near-major league.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, the Pacific Coast League developed into one of the premier regional baseball leagues. The cities enfranchised by the other two high-minor leagues, the International League and the American Association, were generally coordinated geographically with the major leagues, but such was not the case with the PCL. With no major league baseball team existing west of St. Louis, the PCL was unrivaled for American west coast baseball. Although it was never recognized as a true major league, its quality of play was considered very high. Drawing from a strong pool of talent in the area, the PCL produced many outstanding players, including such future major-league Hall of Famers as Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Tony Lazzeri, Paul Waner, Earl Averill, Bobby Doerr, Joe Gordon, and Ernie Lombardi. Amid success experienced after World War II, league President Pants Rowland began to envision the PCL as a third major league. During 1945 the league voted to become a major league. However, the American League and National League were uninterested in allowing it to join their ranks.\nWhile many PCL players went on to play in the major leagues, teams in the league were often successful enough that they could offer competitive salaries to avoid being outbid for their players' services. Some players made a career out of the minor leagues. One of the better known was Frank Shellenback, whose major league pitching career was brief, but who compiled a record PCL total of 295 wins against 178 losses. (It should be mentioned, however, that Shellenback's long career in the PCL was largely due to his use of the spitball, banned in the major leagues in 1920, not the competitive salaries offered by PCL clubs.) Many former major league players came to the PCL to finish their careers after their time in the majors had ended.\nIn 1952, the PCL became the only minor league in history to be given the \"Open\" classification, a grade above the Triple-A level. This limited the rights of major league clubs to draft players from the PCL, and was considered an act toward the circuit becoming a third major league.\nSudden decline.\nThe shift to the Open classification came just as minor league teams from coast to coast suffered a sharp drop in attendance, primarily due to the availability of major league games on television. The hammer blow to the PCL's major league dreams came in 1958 with the arrival of the first MLB teams on the west coast (the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants). As a result, three of the PCL's flagship teams (the Los Angeles Angels, Hollywood Stars, and San Francisco Seals) were immediately forced to relocate to smaller markets. The Oakland Oaks had moved to Canada two years before the Giants arrived. The San Diego Padres and Seattle Rainiers suffered the same fate when they were displaced by major league teams, the new Padres and the Pilots, respectively, in 1969. Additionally, the PCL lost customers to the major league teams which then occupied the same territory. The league never recovered from these blows. The Pacific Coast League reverted to Triple-A classification in 1958, where it remained, and soon diminished in the public eye to nothing more than another minor league.\nMoving beyond the coast.\nThe PCL began to spread out across the nation, and internationally, in the 1950s. Previously, Salt Lake City had been the easternmost city in the league. In 1956, the Oakland Oaks relocated to Canada where they became the Vancouver Mounties, the circuit's first international team. Two years later, the Los Angeles Angels moved to become the Spokane Indians and the San Francisco Seals became the Phoenix Giants.\nThe league continued to expand throughout the country in the 1960s. Clubs representing new cities during the decade included the Dallas Rangers, Denver Bears, Eugene Emeralds, Hawaii Islanders, Indianapolis Indians, Oklahoma City 89ers, Tacoma/Phoenix Giants, and Tucson Toros. From 1964 to 1968 the PCL swelled to twelve teams. The Albuquerque Dukes and Vancouver Canadians were a few of several teams to begin play in the 1970s. Several new teams arrived in the 1980s, such as the Calgary Cannons, Colorado Springs Sky Sox, Edmonton Trappers, and Las Vegas Stars, but the league began to stabilize as franchise relocations became less frequent.\nFurther expansion.\nIn 1998, the Pacific Coast League took on five teams from the disbanding American Association, which had operated in the Midwest, and a sixth franchise was added to the league as an expansion team, thus providing the scheduling convenience of an even number of teams. The addition of the Iowa Cubs, Nashville Sounds, Oklahoma RedHawks, Omaha Royals, New Orleans Zephyrs, and the expansion Memphis Redbirds grew the league to an all-time-high 16 clubs. Despite its name, the league now extended well beyond the Pacific coast, stretching from Western Washington to Middle Tennessee; half of its teams were located east of the Rocky Mountains.\nThe league's presence in Canada diminished and ended in the early 2000s, as the Vancouver Canadians moved to Sacramento to become the RiverCats in 2000 (however, a short-season A club replaced that one there), the Calgary Cannons moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to become the Albuquerque Isotopes in 2003, and the Edmonton Trappers, the circuit's final Canadian team moved to Round Rock in 2005. Of the cities represented in the PCL in its heyday, only Salt Lake City and Sacramento remain, and even these were represented by franchises different from those that originally called these cities home. In 2005, the Pacific Coast League became the first minor league ever to achieve a season attendance of over 7 million. In 2007, league attendance reached an all-time high of 7,420,095.\nIn 2019, the team previously known as the Colorado Springs Sky Sox relocated to San Antonio, Texas and continued play in the PCL as the San Antonio Missions, assuming the identity of a team which had previously competed in the Double-A Texas League. This move was accompanied by realignment in the American Conference. Nashville and Memphis moved to the Northern Division, and Oklahoma City and San Antonio moved to the Southern Division. After the 2019 season, the New Orleans Baby Cakes relocated to Wichita, Kansas where they became known as the Wichita Wind Surge; the Wind Surge, though, would never play a PCL game due to the cancellation of the 2020 season and Minor League Baseball's subsequent reorganization.\nTakeover by Major League Baseball.\nThe start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. As part of Major League Baseball's 2021 reorganization of the minor leagues, the Pacific Coast League was reduced to 10 teams and temporarily renamed the \"Triple-A West\" for the 2021 season. In that reorganization, Memphis, Nashville, Omaha and Iowa were laterally transferred to the International League, but Wichita was demoted to the Double-A Texas League without ever playing a PCL game and San Antonio was returned to that league and level after a single season, and Fresno was demoted three full levels to the now-Low-A California League. The only team added to the PCL was the formerly-independent Sugar Land Skeeters; the other two teams to fill the Triple-A level went to the IL.\nFollowing MLB's acquisition of the rights to the names of the historical minor leagues, the Triple-A West was renamed the Pacific Coast League effective with the 2022 season.\nStructure and season.\nThe league is divided into two divisions, East and West, of five teams each. As of the 2022 season, all teams play a 150-game schedule, beginning in late March and concluding in late September.\nPlayers.\nThe Pacific Coast League uses a salary cap. As of the 2024 season, clubs are required to spend a maximum of US$1,610,000 on player compensation, with a minimum salary of $35,800 per player. For players aged 23 and younger on standard contracts, only 50% of their salary counts towards the cap (up to $250,000 total). There is also a separate salary cap for coaches and technical staff.\nRosters are limited to a size of 28 players on Opening Day weekend, although up to 9 players can be signed on the roster before the transactions date limit.\nChampionship and interleague play.\nBeginning with the 2023 season, the regular season is split into two halves. After the completion of the season, the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series to determine a league champion. The PCL champion then meets the International League's champion in the Triple-A National Championship Game, a single game to determine an overall champion of Triple-A baseball, which has been held annually since 2006, excluding 2020 and 2021. Previously, the PCL champion also competed in the Triple-A World Series (1983, 1998\u20132000), Junior World Series (1919), and other sporadic postseason competitions throughout the league's history.\nOther interleague play occurred during the Triple-A All-Star Game. Traditionally, the game took place on the day after the mid-summer Major League Baseball All-Star Game. The game was meant to mark a symbolic halfway-point in the season (though not the mathematical halfway-point which, for most seasons, is usually one month prior). During the All-Star break, no regular-season games were scheduled for two days before the All-Star Game itself.\nTeams.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRules.\nThe Pacific Coast League plays by the same rules listed in the \"Official Baseball Rules\" published by Major League Baseball. One exception was the use of the designated hitter (DH). Whereas the application of the DH rule in Major League Baseball is determined by the identity of the home team, with the rules of the home team's league applying to both teams, PCL pitchers hit when both clubs were National League affiliates and they agreed to have their pitchers hit. Two National League affiliated clubs may agree to use the DH instead. The reason for this is that as players move up and get closer to reaching the majors, teams prefer to have the rules follow (as closely as possible) those of the major leagues. The DH is always used when one or both teams are American League affiliates. Since MLB's adoption of the universal DH in 2022, this no longer is an issue.\nOther differences lay in the use of professional baseball's pace-of-play initiatives which began to be implemented in 2015. A 15-second pitch clock is used when no runners were on base; 20 seconds are allowed with runners present. Teams are limited to five mound visits during a nine-inning game. Pitchers are required to face a minimum of three consecutive batters until the side is retired or the pitcher is injured and unable to continue playing.\nTeams timeline.\nNote: Teams in italics are PCL \"classic\" teams from the league's height in the 1950s.\nSource:\nFormer American Association teams.\nOne league team was acquired by the PCL following the disbandment of the American Association after the 1997 season.\nFormer Atlantic League teams.\nOne league team joined the PCL from the independent Atlantic League in the 2021 reorganization.\nFormer teams.\nTwo former league teams played in the PCL from 1964 to 1968. Each one had played in the International League during the 1963 season, and each was transferred to the American Association after the 1968 season.\nSeven former league teams were transferred to other leagues in conjunction with the 2021 reorganization of the minors. Memphis, which was created as an expansion team in 1998, was transferred to the International League along with Iowa, Nashville, and Omaha, which joined the PCL from the American Association in 1998. Wichita, which also traces its roots to the American Association, was moved to the Texas League along with San Antonio. Fresno was transferred to the California League.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPresidents.\nSeventeen presidents led the PCL before its 2021 reorganization:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPast champions.\nLeague champions have been determined by different means since the Pacific Coast League's formation in 1903. With few exceptions, most PCL champions through 1927 were simply the regular season pennant winners. However, a few seasons during this time did feature a postseason championship series to crown a champion. It was not until the mid-1930s that the league instituted regular postseason play that was only sporadically cancelled due to financial problems or other factors. Beginning with 2023, the regular-season is split into two halves, and the winners of each half meet in a best-of-three series for the league championship.\nThe San Francisco Seals won 14 PCL championships, the most among all teams in the league, followed by the Los Angeles Angels (12) and the Albuquerque Dukes and Portland Beavers (8).\nAwards.\nThe PCL recognizes outstanding players and team personnel annually near the end of each season.\nMVP Award.\nThe Most Valuable Player Award, first awarded in 1927, is given to honor the best player in the league. The award is voted on by team managers, general managers, broadcasters, and media representatives from around the league, as are all PCL year-end awards.\nPitcher of the Year Award.\nThe Pitcher of the Year Award, awarded sporadically from 1957 to 1974 and continuously since 2001, serves to recognize the league's best pitcher. Pitchers were also eligible to win the MVP Award from 1927 to 2000.\nTop MLB Prospect Award.\nThe Top MLB Prospect Award, created in 1952 as the Rookie of the Year Award and issued from 1952 to 1972 and since 1998, is given to the best player with no prior PCL experience.\nManager of the Year Award.\nThe Manager of the Year Award, started in 1967, is given to the league's top manager.\nExecutive of the Year Award.\nThe Executive of the Year Award, first awarded in 1974, honored team executives who have achieved success in the area of attendance figures, promotions, and community involvement.\nHall of Fame.\nThe Pacific Coast League Hall of Fame was established in 1942 to honor league players, managers, and executives who have made significant contributions to the league's ideals. The Hall of Fame inducted its first class of 12\u00a0men in 1943. The Hall became dormant after 1957, but was revived in 2003, the PCL's centennial season. Today, the Hall of Fame Committee seeks to recognize worthy players throughout the league's history who have made contributions to the league. New members are elected before the start of each season.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69470", "revid": "42383571", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69470", "title": "Terrassa", "text": "Terrassa (, ) is a city in the autonomous community of Catalonia in Spain, in the province of Barcelona. It is one of the two capitals of Vall\u00e8s Occidental county, being the larger in both area and population, and 228,294 respectively.\nThe name \"Terrassa\" derives from Latin \"Terracia\", either from earlier \"Terracium castellum\" (\u201cearthen castle\u201d), or meaning \"terrace\", \"area of flat land\". Historically, the name of the city has been spelled \"Terra\u00e7a, Terraza, Terraca\" and \"Tarrassa\" in the native Catalan language whilst it's been traditionally spelled \"Tarrasa\" in Spanish. The Spanish spelling is now largely out of use given its ties with the Francoist Regime and the sole official spelling being the Catalan \"Terrassa\" since 1978.\nTerrassa is known for its industrial past and present, its lively cultural scene, its industrial modernist architecture, its status as a \"City of Film\" and as the seat of several universities such as UPC, ESCAC, Institut del Teatre and EUIT. It was also awarded in 2024 the Council of Europe's \"The Europe Prize\" for cities with an outstanding commitment to European values.\nIt is the site of Roman Egara, a former Visigothic bishopric, which became a Latin Catholic titular see. Since 2004, it is again the see of a bishopric.\nThe city is located in the Catalan Prelitoral depression (Depressi\u00f3 Prelitoral), at the feet of the Prelitoral mountain range (natural reserve of Sant Lloren\u00e7 del Munt) and the average altitude of the city is 277 meters above sea level. It is 20 and 18 kilometres from Barcelona and Montserrat respectively. Terrassa's location as the most-inland city in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region makes it sometimes be referred to as the \"entrance to Central Catalonia\".\nAs of 2024, Terrassa is the third largest city in Catalonia, after Barcelona and l'Hospitalet de Llobregat. Terrassa is also the largest municipality in what's considered the second most important urban, economic and cultural center of Catalonia, the Vall\u00e8s region.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nThe remains that have been found indicate that the area where Terrassa stands has been inhabited since prehistory. In 2005, during the construction of a tunnel for one of the city's railway lines, a prehistoric site was found in Vallparad\u00eds Park, with stone tools and fossils of hunted animals dating back 800,000 to 1,000,000 years, making this one of the oldest prehistoric sites in Europe.\nAncient Egara.\nTerrassa originated as the Roman town of \"Egara\" (\"Municipium Flavium Egara\"), which was founded during the time of the emperor Vespasian (69\u201379 CE), alongside the torrent of Vallparad\u00eds (nowadays an urban park) close to the Iberian town of \"Egosa\", on the site of which some ceramics and coins have been found.\nModern Terrasa.\nIn the 17th century it was the sight of the Terrasa witchtrials, where 6 women were arrested, tortured and convicted of witchcraft. Five of them were hanged on 27 October 1619 near a present-day railway bridge.\nOther important remains from the Middle Ages are the former cathedral, the castle of Vallparad\u00eds (from 1344 to 1413 a Carthusian monastery and today a municipal museum) and the tower of the castle-palace of the count-king.\nIn the 19th century the city played an important role in the industrial revolution, specializing in woollen fabrics, and today there is a major \"Modernista\" legacy as a result of the city's importance at that time. Particularly notable \"Modernista\" buildings include the Masia Freixa (1907), the Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover textile mill (1907) (now the Museum of Science and Industry of Catalonia), the Principal theater (1920), the city hall (1902), the Alegre de Sagrera house/museum (1911), the Industrial School (1904), the Gran Casino (1920), the Parc de Desinfecci\u00f3 (1920), and the Independ\u00e8ncia market (1908).\nTerrassa is a partner city of the Art nouveau network, a European network of co-operation created in 1999 for the study, preservation and development of Art Nouveau.\nTerrassa is a famous movie production center in Europe and was named a City of Film by UNESCO. The city is home to the largest film studios in Catalonia and the Iberian Peninsula, the Parc Audiovisual de Catalunya, where numerous movies and TV Shows such as REC, A Monster Calls and Operaci\u00f3n Triunfo have been filmed.\nCatastrophes.\nOn 25 September 1962, after a long dry summer, between 212 and 252 litres of rain per square metre fell in three hours. It caused the rivers Llobregat and Bes\u00f2s and their tributaries to overflow, creating a water avenue that caused 700 victims and heavy material losses.\nThe Vall\u00e8s Occidental \"comarca\" was the most damaged. In particularly Terrassa, with 327 victims. The reason of these numbers was that building was permitted around two dry streams used to bring rain water to the Llobregat river. They met in a wedge shape and were not properly channelized. When the streams overflowed it created what was called \"the dead triangle\", with more than a hundred victims in the \u00c8gara neighbourhood alone.\nEcclesiastical history.\nThe episcopal see of \u00c8gara already existed by about 450 CE, when it was established on territory split off from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Barcelona, under the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Tarragona. Pope Hilarius confirmed its autonomy by denying a request around 469 to unite it with the Barcelona under its own first bishop, Ireneus.\nIt comprised parts of these Comarques of Catalonia (Catalan districts) : Alt Pened\u00e8s, Anoia, Baix Llobregat, Vall\u00e8s Occidental and Vall\u00e8s Oriental. A Provincial Council of Tarragona was held there in 615.\nIt effectively succumbed to the Arab (Muslim) conquest in the 8th century and was probably suppressed, its territory being (rather nominally) returned to the Diocese of Barcelona. The Marian cathedral continued to exist until 718, when it was taken over during the Umayyad conquest of Hispania, but was rebuilt in the 12th century, and remains part of a monumental complex of ancient Visigothic-Romanesque churches of Sant Pere de Terrassa and Sant Miquel on the site.\nAfter the Catholic Reconquista of the region in the tenth century, the see was not restored, its territory being incorporated in the (mother) diocese of Barcelona. Why a request to restore the bishopric by its Metropolitan of Tarragona, Cesareo, wasn't honored by Pope John XII (955\u2013964) is unclear.\nIn 2004, Pope John Paul II created the new Diocese of Terrassa on territory taken from the Archdiocese of Barcelona. Its seat is the Cathedral of Holy Spirit.\nDiocese of Egara.\nIn 1969 Pope Paul VI created the titular see of Egara.\nThe title has been held by:\nGovernment.\nThe Municipal Council has 27 seats and according to the result of the local elections of May 2023 is formed by: \nThe municipal government is formed by a coalition of the left of center municipalist Tot per Terrassa and the center-right pro-independence JUNTS. The Mayor is Jordi Ballart (TxT).\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAs of 2024, the population of Terrassa is 228,294, of whom 49.1% are male and 50.9% are female, compared to the nationwide average of 49.0% and 51.0% respectively. People under 16 years old make up 16.2% of the population, and people over 65 years old make up 17.8%, compared to the nationwide average of 14.3% and 20.4% respectively.\nAs of 2024, the foreign-born population is 45,820, equal to 20.1% of the total population. The 5 largest foreign nationalities are Moroccans (14,163), Colombians (3,537), Ecuadorians (3,268), Venezuelans (3,015) and Argentinians (2,014).\nCulture.\nMusic and theater.\nA lot of musicians and actors are based in Terrassa because of the large number of music schools, a long amateur theater tradition and the local seat of the Institut del Teatre. Since 1982, the Terrassa Jazz Festival has been especially outstanding, with guests like Stan Getz, Chet Baker, Dexter Gordon, Tete Montoliu, Dizzy Gillespie. Local bands and musicians such as Doctor Prats, Lildami or Miki N\u00fa\u00f1ez have also developed a national and international following.\nTraditional Catalan Culture.\nThe city is also home to a lively catalan culture scene. Compared to other cities its size, like Sabadell or l'Hospitalet de Llobregat it houses a significant number of \"colles\" (groups) of different catalan cultural traditions. Most notably the Minyons de Terrassa, one of the three \"colles castelleres\" (human tower groups) of the city, is considered among the best in the world and were the first to complete a 10-story human tower in 1998. Alongside the Minyons, the city also houses two other \"colles castelleres\": the Castellers de Terrassa and the University's \"colla\", the Bergants del Campus Terrassa. \nThe city is also home to a multitude of \"diables\" and \"bestiari de foc\" (fire-centric groups) such as the Diables de Terrassa, P\u00e0jara de Terrassa, Drac de Terrassa, Drac Baluk Asharot i Diables de Ca n'Aurell, Bitxo del Torrent Mitger, among many others. The \"bestiari\" (traditional catalan processional figures representing animals) extends also to non-fire figures such as the water-spewing Hipodragona, Cuca Japonesa or the Papallona de Sant Pere or the purely processional figures like the \u00c0liga de Terrassa or the Mulassa de Terrassa. \nIn the realm of Gegants, the city has a very prominent \"colla\" which manages over 3 pairs of processional giants, as well as a \"colla gegantera\" (processional giant group) from the Les Fonts district and the Gegants Bojos de Terrassa group.\nSeveral Sardana-dancing groups as well as Esbart dancers, two Bastoners groups, Ball de Gitanes dancers and Trabucaires also call the city home.\nMass media.\nTerrasa has a local newspaper, the \"Diari de Terrassa\", that is published daily from Tuesday to Saturday, as well as several radio stations: R\u00e0dio Terrassa/Cadena SER Vall\u00e8s on 828 AM and 89.4 FM, with more than 75 years of history behind it, being one of the pioneering radio stations in Catalonia and Spain; the municipal radio (Noucincpuntdos, 95.2 FM); and Radio Star de Terrassa, the city's cultural station, on 100.5 FM, which was founded in 1984 and is one of the historic local radios of Catalonia.\nAlso, the city has several local channels \u2013 TV20 Loc\u00e0lia Vall\u00e8s and Canal Terrassa, with an audience of more than 50,000 viewers. In addition, there is the free newspaper \"Terrassa Societat\", published monthly with a circulation of 50,000, and \"Terrassa Month\", published of Monday through Friday and also covering local events. Since 2005 the municipal digital newspaper e-newsterrassa.com, in Catalan, has been on line \"(as for 2013, this digital newspaper has been taken down)\". The municipal Web site www.terrassa.cat receives no fewer than 150,000 monthly visitors.\nNotable sites.\nThe churches of Sant Pere (Saint Peter).\nThese three churches were built close to the site of old \u00c8gara to be the seat of the \u00c8gara Diocese, which was founded around 450 CE and remained in existence until the 8th century. This episcopal complex follows the Byzantine model of antiquity, with two churches (Sant Pere and Santa Maria) and a mausoleum (Sant Miquel). After a long period of construction, the churches were finished in the then-current manner about the 11th and 12th centuries and in Romanesque style, on the site of the pre-Romanesque buildings of the Visigothic period.\nThe church of Santa Maria contains outstanding works of art, and there are murals dating from the Romanesque period to the Gothic. There is also an altar stone dating from the 10th century and medieval and Romanesque tombstones (one of which documents the name of the Roman town of Egara). In the transept there are three Gothic altarpieces.\nOther.\nThe city is heir to a rich medieval, \"Modernista\" and industrial legacy, and possesses an extensive network of libraries, historical archives and museums.\nTransport.\nTerrassa is served by Josep Tarradellas Barcelona\u2013El Prat Airport and is well connected with Barcelona's port by highway and railway. The C-58 and C-16 also link the city with (Manresa), (Girona, France), and (Tarragona).\nThe railway reached Terrassa in 1856, and nowadays two lines serve the city. The first, operated by Renfe, connects with Barcelona and Lleida, and the second, operated by FGC, with Barcelona. Recently FGC extended its line to the north of the city, building three new stations; one of them acts as a rail hub with the Renfe line. This extension is known as the Terrassa Metro.\nSeveral interurban bus lines connect Terrassa with the closest cities and towns such as Sabadell, Castellar del Vall\u00e8s, Martorell, Rub\u00ed, Sant Cugat del Vall\u00e8s and Vacarisses.\nTransport inside the city is provided by 14 bus lines operated by a municipal company (Transports Municipals d'\u00c8gara). In the future, when the three new FGC stations and the two planned for the Renfe line are in use, the railway will also serve as urban transport.\nSports.\nTerrassa was a pioneer in the introduction of field hockey and korfball in Catalonia and played an important role in the introduction of basketball. The most important sport in the city is field hockey. During the Barcelona Olympic Games in 1992, Terrassa was the city where the field hockey competition was played. The great number of hockey players from Terrassa who have participated in the Olympic Games over the years has led to Terrassa's being referred to as the \"most Olympic city in the world\". Between 1928 and 2004, Terrassa sent 124 athletes to the Olympic Games, the majority of whom were hockey players. Three local field hockey clubs, Atl\u00e8tic Terrassa, Club Egara and Club Deportiu Terrassa have all won the Divisi\u00f3n de Honor de Hockey Hierba and the Copa del Rey de Hockey Hierba. Atl\u00e8tic Terrassa and Club Egara have also won the EuroHockey Club Champions Cup.\nOther local sports teams include Club de Rugby Carboners de Terrassa, CN Terrassa (water polo), Terrassa FC (association football), CP San Crist\u00f3bal (association football) and Sferic Terrassa (basketball).\nTerrassa is the home and birthplace of FC Barcelona and Spain national football team midfielders Xavi and Dani Olmo.\nThe city's castells teams are the Minyons de Terrassa and the Castellers de Terrassa. On 22 November 2015, Terrassa's Pla\u00e7a Vella was the scene of the world's first successful \"4 de 10 amb folre i manilles\", completed by the Minyons.\nTwin towns - sister cities.\nTerrassa is twinned with five cities:\nTerrassa also signed a protocol of special relations cooperation with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A vice-admiral is a flag officer, the naval equivalent of a general officer. A vice-admiral is senior to a rear-admiral and major general, and junior to an admiral and general.\nThe rank insignia of a Canadian vice-admiral is as follows: \nTwo rows of gold oak leaves are located on the black visor of the white service cap. From 1968 to June 2010, the navy blue service dress tunic featured only a wide gold braid around the cuff with three gold maple leaves, beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by a St. Edward's Crown located on cloth shoulder straps.\nVice-admirals are addressed by rank and name; thereafter by subordinates as \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am\". Vice-admirals are normally entitled to a staff car; the car will normally bear a flag, dark blue with three gold maple leaves arranged one over two.\nA vice-admiral generally holds only the most senior command or administrative appointments, barring only Chief of Defence Staff, which is held by a full admiral or general. Appointments held by vice-admirals may include:\nCharles III holds the honorary rank of vice admiral in the Royal Canadian Navy.\nFrance.\nIn France, \"vice-amiral\" is the most senior of the ranks in the French Navy; higher ranks, \"vice-amiral d'escadre\" and \"amiral\", are permanent functions, styles and positions (in French \"rangs et appellations\") given to a \"vice-amiral\"-ranking officer. The \"vice-amiral\" rank used to be an OF-8 rank in NATO charts, but nowadays, it is more an OF-7 rank.\nThe rank of \"vice-amiral d'escadre\" (literally, \"squadron vice-admiral\", with more precision, \"fleet vice-admiral\") equals a NATO OF-8 rank.\nIn the \"ancien r\u00e9gime\" Navy, between 1669 and 1791. The office of \"Vice-Admiral of France\" (\"Vice-amiral de France\") was the highest rank, the supreme office of \"Admiral of France\" being purely ceremonial.\nDistinct offices were :\nVice-amiral commandant.\nVice-amiral commandant (literally, \"commander of the vice admiral) was unofficial rank in World War I. At the time France had the two-rank system of flag officers; as a temporary measure, to bring its system into alignment with the rank system of flag officers of other countries, it is distingunished by wearing a 3mm silver line on the 3-star cap. Such vice admirals enjoyed the status and treatment of full admirals.\nPhilippines.\nIn the Philippines, the rank vice admiral is the highest-ranking official of the Philippine Navy. He is recognized as the flag officer in-command of the navy, an equivalent post to the Chief of Naval Operations in the U.S. Navy.\nPoland.\nBefore World War II, the vice admiral was the highest rank in the Polish Navy. J\u00f3zef Unrug was one of the only two officers to achieve the rank. The other was Jerzy \u015awirski. Poland had only one sovereign sea port, Port of Gdynia, and was slowly building a small modern navy that was to be ready by 1950. The navy was not a priority for obvious reasons.

In most European navies, the equivalent rank is called counter admiral.\nRear admiral is usually immediately senior to commodore and immediately below vice admiral. It is usually equivalent to the rank of major general in armies. In the U.S. Navy and some other navies, there are two rear admiral ranks.\nThe term originated in the days of naval sailing squadrons and can trace its origins to the British Royal Navy. Each naval squadron was assigned an admiral as its head, who commanded from the centre vessel and directed the squadron's activities. The admiral would in turn be assisted by a vice admiral, who commanded the lead ships that bore the brunt of a battle. In the rear of the squadron, a third admiral commanded the remaining ships and, as this section was considered to be in the least danger, the admiral in command of it was typically the most junior. This has continued into the modern age, with rear admiral the most junior admiralty of many navies.\nAustralia.\nThe Royal Australian Navy maintains a rank of rear admiral; refer to Australian Defence Force ranks and insignia. The abbreviation is RADM.\nSince the mid-1990s, the insignia of a Royal Australian Navy rear admiral is the Crown of St. Edward above a crossed sword and baton, above two silver stars, above the word \"Australia\". Like the Royal Navy version, the sword is a traditional naval cutlass. The stars have eight points, unlike the four pointed Order of the Bath stars used by the army (which are often referred to as \"pips\"). Prior to 1995, the RAN shoulder board was identical to the Royal Navy shoulder board. The Royal Navy shoulder board changed again in 2001 and the Australian and UK shoulder boards are now identical except for the word \"Australia\".\nRear Admiral Robyn Walker became the first female admiral in the Royal Australian Navy when she was appointed Surgeon-General of the Australian Defence Force on 16 December 2011.\nCanada.\nIn the Royal Canadian Navy, the rank of rear-admiral (RAdm) (\"contre-amiral\" or \"CAm\" in French) is the Navy rank equivalent to major-general of the Army and Air Force. A rear-admiral is a flag officer, the naval equivalent of a general officer. A rear-admiral is senior to a commodore and brigadier-general, and junior to a vice-admiral and lieutenant-general.\nThe rank insignia for a rear-admiral is two silver maple leaves beneath a silver crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St Edward's Crown, worn on gold shoulder boards on the white short-sleeved shirt or the tropical white tunic. The service dress features a wide strip of gold braid around the cuff and, since June 2010, above it a narrower strip of gold braid embellished with the executive curl. On the visor of the service cap are two rows of gold oak leaves.\nPakistan.\nA rear admiral in the Pakistani Navy is a senior and two-star rank naval officer, appointed in higher naval commands. Like most Commonwealth navies, the rear admiral rank is superior to commodore and captain. However, the rank is junior to the three-star rank vice-admiral and four-star rank admiral, who is generally a Chief of Naval Staff of the Navy.\nNew Zealand.\nThe highest ordinary rank currently filled in the Royal New Zealand Navy is rear admiral and this is the rank held by the Chief of Navy unless that person is also Chief of Defence Force.\nSingapore.\nThe Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) has two ranks with the title of rear admiral: rear-admiral (one-star), a one-star rank; and rear-admiral (two-star), a two-star rank.\nSri Lanka.\nRear admiral is a two-star rank in the Sri Lanka Navy.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden, rear admiral is a two-star admiral rank of the Swedish Navy.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe Royal Navy maintains a rank of rear admiral. Note that the rank of rear admiral is quite different from the honorary office Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, there have been two ranks with the title of rear admiral since 1985: rear admiral (lower half) (RDML), a one-star rank; and rear admiral (RADM), a two-star rank. Prior to that, a combination of ranks was used. Both the rear admiral (lower half) and rear admiral ranks exist in four of the uniformed services of the United States: the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Commissioned Officer Corps.\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This page lists nonincremental inventions that are widely recognized by reliable sources as having had a direct impact on the course of history that was profound, global, and enduring. The dates in this article make frequent use of the units mya and kya, which refer to millions and thousands of years ago, respectively.\nPaleolithic.\nThe dates listed in this section refer to the earliest evidence of an invention found and dated by archaeologists (or in a few cases, suggested by indirect evidence). Dates are often approximate and change as more research is done, reported and seen. Older examples of any given technology are often found. The locations listed are for the site where the earliest solid evidence has been found, but especially for the earlier inventions, there is little certainty how close that may be to where the invention took place.\nLower Paleolithic.\nThe Lower Paleolithic period lasted over 3 million years, during which there many human-like species evolved including toward the end of this period, \"Homo sapiens\". The original divergence between humans and chimpanzees occurred 13 (Mya), however interbreeding continued until as recently as 4 Mya, with the first species clearly belonging to the human (and not chimpanzee) lineage being \"Australopithecus anamensis\". Some species are controversial among paleoanthropologists, who disagree whether they are species on their own or not. Here Homo ergaster is included under Homo erectus, while Homo rhodesiensis is included under Homo heidelbergensis.\nDuring this period the Quaternary glaciation began (about 2.58 million years ago), and continues to today. It has been an ice age, with cycles of 40\u2013100,000 years alternating between long, cold, more glaciated periods, and shorter warmer periods \u2013 interglacial episodes.\nMiddle Paleolithic.\nThe evolution of early modern humans around 300 kya coincides with the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. During this 250,000-year period, our related archaic humans such as Neanderthals and Denisovans began to spread out of Africa, joined later by \"Homo sapiens\". Over the course of the period we see evidence of increasingly long-distance trade, religious rites, and other behavior associated with Behavioral modernity.\nUpper Paleolithic to Early Mesolithic.\n50 kya was long regarded as the beginning of behavioral modernity, which defined the Upper Paleolithic period. The Upper Paleolithic lasted nearly 40,000 years, while research continues to push the beginnings of behavioral modernity earlier into the Middle Paleolithic. Behavioral modernity is characterized by the widespread observation of religious rites, artistic expression and the appearance of tools made for purely intellectual or artistic pursuits.\nAgricultural and proto-agricultural eras.\nThe end of the Last Glacial Period (\"ice age\") and the beginning of the Holocene around 11.7 ka coincide with the Agricultural Revolution, marking the beginning of the agricultural era, which persisted there until the industrial revolution.\nNeolithic and Late Mesolithic.\nDuring the Neolithic period, lasting 8400 years, stone began to be used for construction, and remained a predominant hard material for toolmaking. Copper and arsenic bronze were developed towards the end of this period, and of course the use of many softer materials such as wood, bone, and fibers continued. Domestication spread both in the sense of how many species were domesticated, and how widespread the practice became.\nBronze Age.\nThe beginning of bronze-smelting coincides with the emergence of the first cities and of writing in the Ancient Near East and the Indus Valley. The Bronze Age starting in Eurasia in the 4th millennia BC and ended, in Eurasia, c.1200 BC.\nIron Age.\nThe Late Bronze Age collapse occurs around 1200 BC, extinguishing most Bronze-Age Near Eastern cultures, and significantly weakening the rest. This is coincident with the complete collapse of the Indus Valley Civilisation. This event is followed by the beginning of the Iron Age. We define the Iron Age as ending in 510 BC for the purposes of this article, even though the typical definition is region-dependent (e.g. 510 BC in Greece, 322 BC in India, 200 BC in China), thus being an 800-year period.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Common uses for radio waves in the VHF band are Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) and FM radio broadcasting, television broadcasting, two-way land mobile radio systems (emergency, business, private use and military), long range data communication up to several tens of kilometers with radio modems, amateur radio, and marine communications. Air traffic control communications and air navigation systems (e.g. VOR and ILS) work at distances of or more to aircraft at cruising altitude.\nIn the Americas and many other parts of the world, VHF Band I was used for the transmission of analog television. As part of the worldwide transition to digital terrestrial television most countries require broadcasters to air television in the VHF range using digital, rather than analog encoding.\nPropagation characteristics.\nRadio waves in the VHF band propagate mainly by line-of-sight and ground-bounce paths; unlike in the HF band there is only some reflection at lower frequencies from the ionosphere (skywave propagation). They do not follow the contour of the Earth as ground waves and so are blocked by hills and mountains, although because they are weakly refracted (bent) by the atmosphere they can travel somewhat beyond the visual horizon out to about 160\u00a0km (100 miles). They can penetrate building walls and be received indoors, although in urban areas reflections from buildings cause multipath propagation, which can interfere with television reception. Atmospheric radio noise and interference (RFI) from electrical equipment is less of a problem in this and higher frequency bands than at lower frequencies. The VHF band is the first band at which efficient transmitting antennas are small enough that they can be mounted on vehicles and portable devices, so the band is used for two-way land mobile radio systems, such as walkie-talkies, and two way radio communication with aircraft (Airband) and ships (marine radio). Occasionally, when conditions are right, VHF waves can travel long distances by tropospheric ducting due to refraction by temperature gradients in the atmosphere.\nLine-of-sight calculation.\nVHF transmission range is a function of transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and distance to the horizon, since VHF signals propagate under normal conditions as a near line-of-sight phenomenon. The distance to the radio horizon is slightly extended over the geometric line of sight to the horizon, as radio waves are weakly bent back toward the Earth by the atmosphere.\nAn approximation to calculate the line-of-sight horizon distance (on Earth) is:\nThese approximations are only valid for antennas at heights that are small compared to the radius of the Earth. They may not necessarily be accurate in mountainous areas, since the landscape may not be transparent enough for radio waves.\nIn engineered communications systems, more complex calculations are required to assess the probable coverage area of a proposed transmitter station.\nAntennas.\nVHF is the first band at which wavelengths are small enough that efficient transmitting antennas are short enough to mount on vehicles and handheld devices, a quarter wave whip antenna at VHF frequencies is 25\u00a0cm to 2.5 meter (10 inches to 8 feet) long. So the VHF and UHF wavelengths are used for two-way radios in vehicles, aircraft, and handheld transceivers and walkie-talkies. Portable radios usually use whips or rubber ducky antennas, while base stations usually use larger fiberglass whips or collinear arrays of vertical dipoles.\nFor directional antennas, the Yagi antenna is the most widely used as a high gain or \"beam\" antenna. For television reception, the Yagi is used, as well as the log-periodic antenna due to its wider bandwidth. Helical and turnstile antennas are used for satellite communication since they employ circular polarization. For even higher gain, multiple Yagis or helicals can be mounted together to make array antennas. Vertical collinear arrays of dipoles can be used to make high gain omnidirectional antennas, in which more of the antenna's power is radiated in horizontal directions. Television and FM broadcasting stations use collinear arrays of specialized dipole antennas such as batwing antennas.\nUniversal use.\nCertain subparts of the VHF band have the same use around the world. Some national uses are detailed below.\nBy country.\nAustralia.\nThe VHF TV band in Australia was originally allocated channels 1 to 10-with channels\u00a02, 7 and 9 assigned for the initial services in Sydney and Melbourne, and later the same channels were assigned in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. Other capital cities and regional areas used a combination of these and other frequencies as available. The initial commercial services in Hobart and Darwin were respectively allocated channels\u00a06 and 8 rather than 7 or 9.\nBy the early 1960s it became apparent that the 10\u00a0VHF channels were insufficient to support the growth of television services. This was rectified by the addition of three additional frequencies-channels 0, 5A and 11. Older television sets using rotary dial tuners required adjustment to receive these new channels. Most TVs of that era were not equipped to receive these broadcasts, and so were modified at the owners' expense to be able to tune into these bands; otherwise the owner had to buy a new TV.\nSeveral TV stations were allocated to VHF channels\u00a03, 4 and 5, which were within the FM radio bands although not yet used for that purpose. A couple of notable examples were NBN-3 Newcastle, WIN-4 Wollongong and ABC Newcastle on channel\u00a05. While some Channel\u00a05 stations were moved to 5A in the 1970s and 80s, beginning in the 1990s, the Australian Broadcasting Authority began a process to move these stations to UHF bands to free up valuable VHF spectrum for its original purpose of FM radio. In addition, by 1985 the federal government decided new TV stations are to be broadcast on the UHF band.\nTwo new VHF channels, 9A and 12, have since been made available and are being used primarily for digital services (e.g. ABC in capital cities) but also for some new analogue services in regional areas. Because channel\u00a09A is not used for television services in or near Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide or Perth, digital radio in those cities are broadcast on DAB frequencies blocks 9A, 9B and 9C.\nVHF radio is also used for marine Radio as per its long-distance reachability comparing UHF frequencies.\nExample allocation of VHF\u2013UHF frequencies: \nNew Zealand.\nUntil 2013, the four main free-to-air TV stations in New Zealand used the VHF television bands (Band I and Band III) to transmit to New Zealand households. Other stations, including a variety of pay and regional free-to-air stations, were forced to broadcast in the UHF band, since the VHF band had been very overloaded with four stations sharing a very small frequency band, which was so overcrowded that one or more channels would not be available in some smaller towns.\nHowever, at the end of 2013, all television channels stopped broadcasting on the VHF bands, as New Zealand moved to digital television broadcasting, requiring all stations to either broadcast on UHF or satellite (where UHF was unavailable) utilising the Freeview service.\nRefer to Australasian television frequencies for more information.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBritish television originally used VHF band I and band III. Television on VHF was in black and white with 405-line format (although there were experiments with all three colour systems-NTSC, PAL, and SECAM-adapted for the 405-line system in the late 1950s and early 1960s).\nBritish colour television was broadcast on UHF (channels 21\u201369), beginning in the late 1960s. From then on, TV was broadcast on both VHF and UHF (VHF being a monochromatic downconversion from the 625-line colour signal), with the exception of BBC2 (which had always broadcast solely on UHF). The last British VHF TV transmitters closed down on January 3, 1985. VHF band III is now used in the UK for digital audio broadcasting, and VHF band II is used for FM radio, as it is in most of the world.\nUnusually, the UK has an amateur radio allocation at 4 metres, 70\u201370.5\u00a0MHz.\nUnited States and Canada.\nFrequency assignments between US and Canadian users are closely coordinated since much of the Canadian population is within VHF radio range of the US border. Certain discrete frequencies are reserved for radio astronomy.\nThe general services in the VHF band are:\nCable television, though not transmitted aerially, uses a spectrum of frequencies overlapping VHF.\nVHF television.\nThe U.S. FCC allocated television broadcasting to a channelized roster as early as 1938 with 19\u00a0channels. That changed three more times: in 1940 when Channel\u00a019 was deleted and several channels changed frequencies, then in 1946 with television going from 18\u00a0channels to 13\u00a0channels, again with different frequencies, and finally in 1948 with the removal of Channel\u00a01 (analog channels\u00a02\u201313 remain as they were, even on cable television). Channels 14\u201319 later appeared on the UHF band, while channel 1 remains unused.\n87.5\u201387.9 MHz.\n87.5\u201387.9\u00a0MHz is a radio band which, in most of the world, is used for FM broadcasting. In North America, however, this bandwidth is allocated to VHF television channel\u00a06 (82\u201388\u00a0MHz). The analog audio for TV channel\u00a06 is broadcast at 87.75\u00a0MHz (adjustable down to 87.74). Several stations, known as Frankenstations, most notably those joining the Pulse 87 franchise, have operated on this frequency as radio stations, though they use television licenses. As a result, FM radio receivers such as those found in automobiles which are designed to tune into this frequency range could receive the audio for analog-mode programming on the local TV channel 6 while in North America. The practice largely ended with the DTV transition in 2009, although some still exist.\nThe FM broadcast channel at 87.9\u00a0MHz is normally off-limits for FM audio broadcasting; it is reserved for displaced class\u00a0D stations which have no other frequencies in the normal 88.1\u2013107.9\u00a0MHz subband to move to. So far, only two stations have qualified to operate on 87.9\u00a0MHz: 10\u2013watt KSFH in Mountain View, California and 34\u2013watt translator K200AA in Sun Valley, Nevada.\nUnlicensed operation.\nIn some countries, particularly the United States and Canada, limited low-power license-free operation is available in the FM broadcast band for purposes such as micro-broadcasting and sending output from CD or digital media players to radios without auxiliary-in jacks, though this is illegal in some other countries. This practice was legalised in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2006.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The story focuses on Victor, a sex addict and con man who also works at a colonial reenactment museum. The novel was later adapted for film by Clark Gregg.\nPlot summary.\n\"Choke\" follows Victor Mancini and his friend Denny through a few months of their lives with frequent flashbacks to the days when Victor was a child. Victor had grown up moving from one foster home to another as his mother was found to be unfit to raise him. During his childhood, his mother would kidnap him from his various foster parents, though every time they would eventually be caught and he would again be remanded over to the child welfare agency.\nIn the present-day setting of the book, Victor has left medical school to support his feeble mother, who is now in a nursing home. In order to pay for elder care for his mother, he resorts to being a con artist. Victor goes to various restaurants and purposely causes himself to choke midway through his meal, luring a \"good Samaritan\" into saving his life. He keeps a detailed list of everyone who saves him and sends them frequent letters about fictional bills he is unable to pay, causing them to send him money out of sympathy. \nVictor works at a re-enactment museum set in colonial times, where most of the employees are drug addicts or, in Denny's case, a fellow recovering sex addict. He spends most of his time on the job guarding Denny (who is constantly being caught with \"contraband\" items that do not correspond with the time period of the museum) in the stocks. The two met at a sex addiction support group and later applied together for the same job. Denny is later fired from the museum, and begins collecting stones from around the city to build his \"dream home\".\nWhile growing up, Victor's mother taught him numerous conspiracy theories and obscure medical facts, which both confused and frightened him. This and his constant moves from one home to another have left Victor unable to form lasting and stable relationships with women. As a result, Victor finds himself getting sexual gratification from women on a solely superficial level. Later on, he starts talking to his mother again for the first time in years.\nFilm adaptation.\nA film adaptation directed by Clark Gregg, starring Sam Rockwell and Anjelica Huston, was released commercially on September 26, 2008. Palahniuk makes a cameo appearance in the film.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Besides the Hall of Fame, it also operates a museum in Alexandria, Virginia, sponsors educational programs, and a collegiate competition.\nAs of 2025, 652\ninventors have been inducted, mostly constituting historic persons from the past three centuries, but also including living inductees. Nominees must hold a US patent of significant contribution to the US welfare, and which advances science and useful arts.\nHistory.\nThe National Inventors Hall of Fame was founded in 1973 on the initiative of H. Hume Mathews, then the chairman of the National Council of Patent Law Associations (now the National Council of Intellectual Property Law Associations). It was launched by Ed Sobey, who was also the first director. In 1974, it gained a major sponsor in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office from Washington, D.C.\nAt first, the Hall was housed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Washington, D.C., near the Washington National Airport but it soon needed more room at a more prominent location. A committee was formed in 1986 to find a new home for it. For a time, the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was the frontrunner. But in 1987, a patent attorney from Akron, Edwin \"Ned\" Oldham, the representative from the National Council of Patent Law Associations, led the drive to move the Hall to Akron. According to Maurice H. Klitzman, one of the founding members of the Board of Directors, because of the guaranteed financial support by the city of Akron that greatly exceeded any other community's proposal, the Board selected Akron as the new home. The construction of the new building was finished in 1995 and the Hall opened to the public with the name of the Inventure Place.\nFrom the beginning, the Inventure Place was intended to be more than a science and technology museum and library. It was designed to double as an inventor's workshop and a national resource center for creativity. Designed by an architect from New York City, James Stewart Polshek, it was a stainless-steel building, shaped like a curving row of white sails, with five tiers of exhibits. One of the exhibits allowed the visitors to use computer programs for making animations and mechanisms for running laser-light shows.\nBut attendance did not meet expectations and the museum never made a profit, although its related ventures and programs, such as Invent Now and Camp Invention, proved to be more successful. In 2002, its name was changed to the National Inventors Hall of Fame Museum (NIHFM). Six years later the NIHFM moved to Alexandria, Virginia. Its former facility was converted to a specialty school for students in grades between 5th and 8th. Since 2010 it has been the National Inventors Hall of Fame STEM Middle School, a middle school for the Akron Public Schools.\nAn annual induction ceremony is held to honor the newest inventor members. The venue is typically held near the NIHFM, though location varies; e.g., Arlington, VA in 1980; Akron, OH in 1990 and 2006; and Washington, DC in 2003 and 2010 onward.\n During the museum's 2009 relocation, inductions were held at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA.\nActivities.\nIn Alexandria, the National Inventors Hall of Fame operates a museum in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office building at 600 Dulany Street, with a gallery of digital portraits of the honorees, interactive kiosks and a theater. Admission is free.\nIn addition to the exhibits of the artifacts and documents from the collections of the Patent and Trademark Office, it also sponsors Camp Invention, Club Invention, and the Collegiate Inventors Competition.\nCamp Invention, founded in 1990, is a daytime summer camp for children, with program sites in 49 states. Camp Invention is the only nationally recognized summer program focused on creativity, innovation, real-world problem solving and the spirit of the invention.\nThe Collegiate Inventors Competition was created in 1990 to encourage college and university students to be creative and innovative with science, engineering, and technology for dealing with the problems of the world. Since then, with the help from the sponsors, it has awarded more than $1 million to the winning students in two categories, undergraduate and graduate. In 2012, the first places were won with a delivery therapy for treating cancer and a way to facilitate suturing in abdominal surgery. Other finalists included the use of CT scanning and 3-D printing technology to replicate an amputee's lost hand, a low-profile shoulder brace that can be applied by the athletes themselves, and an electric motorcycle that runs on spheres instead of wheels.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the fourth and youngest son of King John II of France and Bonne of Luxembourg.\nPhilip was the founder of the Burgundian branch of the House of Valois. His vast collection of territories made him the undisputed premier peer of the Kingdom of France and made his successors formidable subjects, and later rivals, of the kings of France.\nPhilip played an important role in the development of gunpowder artillery in European warfare, making extensive and successful use of it in his military campaigns.\nBy political marriage, from 1384 Philip gained control over Flanders, one of the most wealthy provinces of Europe in that time. He and his successors ruled it until 1482. This period is referred to as the Burgundian Netherlands.\nEarly life.\nPhilip was born in Pontoise in 1342 to John and Bonne of Luxembourg. His father, John, was the eldest son of Philip VI of France and Joan of Burgundy. His father became king of France in 1350. Philip became known as \"the Bold\" at the age of 14, when he fought beside his father at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. They were captured during the battle by the English. He remained in custody with his father until the terms of their ransom were agreed to in the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny of 1360. He was created duke of Touraine in 1360, but in 1363, he returned this duchy to the crown to receive instead the Duchy of Burgundy in apanage from his father as a reward for his courage at the Battle of Poitiers.\nDuke of Burgundy.\nOn 19 June 1369, Philip married the 19-year-old Margaret, daughter of Count Louis II of Flanders, who in 1382 inherited the County of Flanders, the Duchy of Brabant, the County of Artois, and the Free County of Burgundy.\nFrom 1379 to 1382, Philip helped his father-in-law Louis II put down revolts in Flanders, particularly in Ghent, by organising an army against Philip van Artevelde. The revolts were finally ended in 1385, following the death of Louis II, with the Peace of Tournai. As \"jure uxoris\" Count of Flanders, he would keep in mind the economic interests of the Flemish cities, which mainly made their money from weaving and spinning. He was aided in this by the expansion of the Three Members \u2013 a parliament consisting of representatives from the towns of Bruges, Ghent and Ypres \u2013 to the Four Members through the addition of the rural area Franc of Bruges.\nIn 1390, Philip also became the Count of Charolais, a title used by Philip the Good and Charles the Bold as the heirs of Burgundy.\nPhilip was very active at the court of France, particularly after the death in 1380 of his brother King Charles V, whose successor Charles VI became king at the age of 11. During Charles' minority, a council of Regents was set up to govern France that was made up of four of his uncles: Louis, Duke of Anjou, John, Duke of Berry, and Philip himself from his father's side, and from his mother's side, Louis II, Duke of Bourbon. Among Philip's acts while regent was the suppression of a tax revolt in 1382 known as the Harelle. The regency lasted until 1388, always with Philip assuming the dominant role: Louis of Anjou spent much effort fighting for his claim to the Kingdom of Naples after 1382 and died in 1384, John of Berry was interested mainly in the Languedoc and not particularly interested in politics, and Louis of Bourbon was largely an unimportant figure due to his personality (he showed signs of mental instability) and his status (since he was not the son of a king). However, Philip, along with John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon, lost most of their power at court in 1388, when Charles VI chose to favour the advice of the Marmousets, his personal advisors, over that of his uncles when he attained his majority.\nIn 1392, events conspired to allow Philip to seize power once more in France. Charles VI's friend and advisor Olivier de Clisson had recently been the target of an assassination attempt by agents of John V, Duke of Brittany. The would-be assassin, Pierre de Craon, had taken refuge in Brittany. Charles, outraged at these events, determined to punish Craon, and on 1 July 1392 led an expedition against Brittany. While travelling to Brittany, the king, already overwrought by the slow progress, was shocked by a madman who spent half-an-hour following the procession to warn the king that he had been betrayed. When a page dropped a lance, the king reacted by killing several of his knights and had to be wrestled to the ground. Philip, who was present, immediately assumed command and appointed himself regent, dismissing Charles' advisors. He was the principal ruler of France until 1402.\nHis seizure of power, however, had disastrous consequences for the unity of the House of Valois and of France itself. The king's brother Louis, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, resented his uncle taking over as regent instead of himself; the result was a feud between Philip and Louis that continued after their deaths by their families. In particular, both quarreled over royal funds, which each desired to appropriate for his own ends: Louis to fund his extravagant lifestyle, Philip to further his expansionist ambitions in Burgundy and the Low Countries. This struggle only served to enhance the reputation of Philip, since he appeared to be a sober and honest reformer in comparison to the profligate and irresponsible Louis. Although Charles VI confirmed his brother as regent in 1402 in a rare moment of sanity, Louis's misrule allowed Philip to regain control of France as regent in 1404, shortly before his death.\nIn 1395, Philip the Bold outlawed cultivation of the Gamay grape in favour of Pinot Noir in an early example of agricultural regulation related to wine quality.\nPhilip died in Halle, County of Hainaut (modern Belgium), on 27 April 1404. His territories were bequeathed to his eldest son John the Fearless, who also inherited Philip's political position in France and the leadership of the Burgundian branch of the Valois family against the Orl\u00e9ans branch.\nTomb.\nIn 1378, Philip the Bold acquired the domain of Champmol, just outside Dijon, to build the Chartreuse de Champmol (1383\u20131388), a Carthusian monastery (\"Charterhouse\"), which he intended to house the tombs of his dynasty. His tomb, with pleurants and his recumbent effigy, is an outstanding work of Burgundian sculpture. They were created by Jean de Marville (1381\u20131389), Claus Sluter (1389\u20131406) and Claus de Werve (1406\u20131410). Jean Malouel, official painter to the duke, was responsible for the polychrome and gilt decoration. After his death, the body of Philip the Bold was eviscerated and embalmed, then placed in a lead coffin. It was then deposited in the choir of Chartreuse de Champmol on 16 June 1404. His internal organs were sent to the church of Saint Martin at Halle. In 1792, his body was transferred to Dijon Cathedral, and in the following year, his tomb was damaged by revolutionaries and looters. It was restored in the first half of the 19th century and today it is in housed the former palace of the dukes, now part of the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Dijon.\nMarriage and issue.\nPhilip the Bold married the future Countess Margaret III of Flanders on 19 June 1369, a marriage that would eventually reunite not only the Duchy of Burgundy with the Free County of Burgundy and the County of Artois, but also unite it to the rich County of Flanders. Philip and Margaret had the following children:\nIn arranging the marriages of his children, Philip followed an intelligent diplomatic and strategic design that would be followed by his successors in Burgundy as far as Emperor Maximilian I. For example, the double marriage in 1385 at Cambrai of his son, John the Fearless, and his daughter, Margaret, to Margaret of Bavaria and William of Bavaria, son and daughter of Albert, Count of Hainault and Holland, prepared the later union of Hainault and Holland with Burgundy and Flanders, as carried out by Philip's grandson, Philip the Good. The marriages also inserted the new Valois Burgundy dynasty into the Wittelsbach network of alliances: the other daughters of Count Albert married William I, Duke of Guelders and Wenceslaus, King of Bohemia; their cousin, Isabeau of Bavaria married Charles VI of France, and became Queen of France.\nIn addition to his alliance with the Netherlandish Bavarians, Philip also made links with the Dukes of Austria and of Savoy by marrying his daughter Catherine to Leopold IV of Austria and his daughter Mary to Amadeus VIII of Savoy.\nResidences.\nFew of Philip the Bold's residences are still extant. Apart from several elements of the ducal palace in Dijon (Tour de Bar), the Ch\u00e2teau de Germolles is largely preserved. This residence was offered to his wife, Margaret III, Countess of Flanders in 1381. The princess transformed the old fortress into a luxurious home with the help of artists from the Burgundian School Claus Sluter and Jean de Beaumetz.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Known for his piety, charity, and gentle nature, he is venerated by the Catholic Church with a liturgical feast on 30 March. He was beatified by Pope Innocent XI in 1677.\nLife.\nAmadeus was born in Thonon-les-Bains, the son of Louis, Duke of Savoy, and Anne de Lusignan, daughter of Janus of Cyprus, King of Cyprus. In 1452, his mother arranged a political marriage to Yolande of Valois (1434\u20131478), sister of Louis XI of France and daughter of Charles VII of France. Because of his epilepsy and retirement, she was left in control of the state.\nFrance and the Holy Roman Empire competed to gain control of Savoy's strategically important Alpine mountain passes and trade routes. His sister, Charlotte of Savoy, became the second wife of Louis XI of France. French influence increased in Savoy and involved the country in the wars between France and the emperors. The Castle of Moncalleri in Piedmont, Italy had been built around 1100 as a hill fortress, to command the main southern access from Turin. In the mid-15th century, Yolande turned it into a Renaissance Royal Palace.\nAmadeus was a particular protector of Franciscan friars. He also endowed other religious houses as well as homes for the care of the poor and suffering. He made a pilgrimage to Saint-Claude in 1471. He died the following year.\nAmadeus was an avid collector of manuscripts, adding over sixty items to the ducal library started by his great-grandfather Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy.\nFamily.\nAmadeus IX had ten children with Yolande of Valois:\nHis daughter Louise became a nun of the Franciscan Second Order after being widowed at a young age. She was also beatified.\nBeatification.\nA reputation for miracles began to grow around a 1474 painting of Amadeus, which was housed in the Dominican church in Turin.\nMichel Merle suggests that the cult of Amadeus was part of a decades-long effort on the part of the House of Savoy to enhance its political status. 1612 saw the publication in Turin of a brief text extolling Amadeus, by Girolamo Cordieri, canon of the cathedral chapter of Mondovi. Cordieri was later to be appointed theologian to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. Also in 1612, a canon from Vercelli published a compendium of miracles attributed to Amadeus' intercession.\nIn 1613, a \"Historia del Beato Amedeo terzo duca di Savoia\" was composed by Fr. Pietro-Francisco Malletta. Six years later, the Duke of Savoy issued nine-florin coins depicting Amadeus IX on one side. These appear to have been used as religious medals, particularly in the Chablais, where they were distributed by Francis de Sales.\nPresented as a holy prince known for his charity and concern for the poor, Amadeus IX was beatified on 3 March 1677 by Pope Innocent XI.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The language originates from what is now known as Ethiopia and Eritrea.\nAs of today, Ge\u02bdez is used as the main liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Ethiopian Catholic Church, the Eritrean Catholic Church, and the Beta Israel Jewish community.\nHawulti Obelisk is an ancient pre-Aksumite obelisk located in Matara, Eritrea. The monument dates to the early Aksumite period and bears an example of the ancient Ge\u02bdez script.\nIn one study, Tigre was found to have a 71% lexical similarity to Ge\u02bdez, while Tigrinya had a 68% lexical similarity to Ge\u02bdez, followed by Amharic at 62%. Most linguists believe that Ge\u02bdez does not constitute a common ancestor of modern Ethio-Semitic languages but became a separate language early on from another hypothetical unattested common language.\nPhonology.\nVowels.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nHistorically, has a basic correspondence with Proto-Semitic short and , with short , the vowels with Proto-Semitic long respectively, and with the Proto-Semitic diphthongs and . In Ge\u02bdez there still exist many alternations between and , less so between and , e.g. \"taloku\" ~ \"talawku\" (\"I followed\").\nIn the transcription employed by the Encyclopaedia Aethiopica, which is widely employed in academia, the contrast here represented as a/\u0101 is represented as \u00e4/a.\nConsonants.\nTransliteration.\nGe\u02bdez is transliterated according to the following system (see the phoneme table below for IPA values):\nBecause Ge\u02bdez is no longer spoken in daily life by large communities, the early pronunciation of some consonants is not completely certain. Gragg writes that \"[t]he consonants corresponding to the graphemes (Ge\u02bdez ) and (Ge\u02bdez ) have merged with \u1230 and \u1338 respectively in the phonological system represented by the traditional pronunciation\u2014and indeed in all modern Ethiopian Semitic. ... There is, however, no evidence either in the tradition or in Ethiopian Semitic [for] what value these consonants may have had in Ge\u02bdez.\"\nA similar problem is found for the consonant transliterated . Gragg notes that it corresponds in etymology to velar or uvular fricatives in other Semitic languages, but it is pronounced exactly the same as in the traditional pronunciation. Though the use of a different letter shows that it must originally have had some other pronunciation, what that pronunciation was is not certain.\nThe chart below lists and as possible values for () and () respectively. It also lists as a possible value for (). These values are tentative, but based on the reconstructed Proto-Semitic consonants that they are descended from.\nPhonemes of Ge\u02bdez.\nThe following table presents the consonants of the Ge\u02bdez language. The reconstructed phonetic value of a phoneme is given in IPA transcription, followed by its representation in the Ge\u02bdez script and scholarly transliteration.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGe\u02bdez consonants in relation to Proto-Semitic.\nGe\u02bdez consonants have a triple opposition between voiceless, voiced, and ejective (or emphatic) obstruents. The Proto-Semitic \"emphasis\" in Ge\u02bdez has been generalized to include emphatic . Ge\u02bdez has phonologized labiovelars, descending from Proto-Semitic biphonemes. Ge\u02bdez \u015b Sawt (in Amharic, also called \"\u015be-nig\u016b\u015b\", i.e. the \"se\" letter used for spelling the word \"nig\u016b\u015b\" \"king\") is reconstructed as descended from a Proto-Semitic voiceless lateral fricative . Like Arabic, Ge\u02bdez merged Proto-Semitic \u0161 and s in (also called \"se-isat\": the \"se\" letter used for spelling the word \"is\u0101t\" \"fire\"). Apart from this, Ge\u02bdez phonology is comparably conservative; the only other Proto-Semitic phonological contrasts lost may be the interdental fricatives and ghayn.\nStress.\nThere is no evidence within the script of stress rules in the ancient period, but stress patterns exist within the liturgical tradition(s). Accounts of these patterns are, however, contradictory. One early 20th-century account may be broadly summarized as follows:\nAs one example of a discrepancy, a different late 19th-century account says the masculine singular imperative is stressed on the ultima (e.g. \"n\u0259g\u0259\u0301r\", \"speak!\"), and that, in some patterns, words can be stressed on the third-, fourth- or even fifth-to-last syllable (e.g. \"b\u00e1rakata\").\nDue to the high predictability of stress location in most words, textbooks, dictionaries and grammars generally do not mark it. Minimal pairs do exist, however, such as \"y\u0259nagg\u0259r\u0101\u0301\" (\"he speaks to her\", with the pronoun suffix \"-(h)\u0101\u0301\" \"her\") vs. \"y\u0259nagg\u0259\u0301r\u0101\" (\"they speak\", feminine plural), both written .\nMorphology.\nNouns.\nGe\u02bdez distinguishes two genders, masculine and feminine, the latter of which is sometimes marked with the suffix , e.g. (\"sister\"). These are less strongly distinguished than in other Semitic languages, as many nouns not denoting humans can be used in either gender: in translated Christian texts there is even a tendency for nouns to follow the gender of the noun with a corresponding meaning in Greek.\nThere are two numbers, singular and plural. The plural can be constructed either by suffixing to a word (regardless of gender, but often if it is a male human noun), or by using an internal plural.\nNouns also have two cases: the nominative, which is not marked, and the accusative, which is marked with final . As in other Semitic languages, there are at least two \"states\", absolute (unmarked) and construct (marked with as well).\nAs in Classical/Standard Arabic, singular and plural nouns often take the same final inflectional affixes for case and state, as number morphology is achieved via attaching a suffix to the stem and/or an internal change in the stem.\nThere is some morphological interaction between consonant-final nouns and a pronoun suffix (see the table of suffix pronouns below). For example, when followed by (\"my\"), in both nominative and accusative the resulting form is (i.e. the accusative is \"not\" ), but with (\"your\", masculine singular) there's a distinction between nominative and accusative , and similarly with (\"his\") between nominative (&lt; ) and accusative (&lt; ).\nInternal plural.\nInternal plurals follow certain patterns. Triconsonantal nouns follow one of the following patterns.\nQuadriconsonantal and some triconsonantal nouns follow the following pattern. Triconsonantal nouns that take this pattern must have at least one \"long\" vowel (namely ).\nPronominal morphology.\nIn the independent pronouns, gender is not distinguished in the 1st person, and case is only distinguished in the 3rd person singular.\nSuffix pronouns attach at the end of a noun, preposition or verb. The accusative/construct is lost when a plural noun with a consonant-final stem has a pronoun suffix attached (generally replaced by the added , as in , \"his\"), thereby losing the case/state distinction, but the distinction may be retained in the case of consonant-final singular nouns. Furthermore, suffix pronouns may or may not attract stress to themselves. In the following table, pronouns without a stress mark (an acute) are not stressed, and vowel-initial suffixes have also been given the base in the script.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSyntax.\nNoun phrases.\nNoun phrases have the following overall order:\n(demonstratives) noun (adjective)-(relative clause)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAdjectives and determiners agree with the noun in gender and number:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRelative clauses are introduced by a pronoun which agrees in gender and number with the preceding noun:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs in many Semitic languages, possession by a noun phrase is shown through the construct state. In Ge\u02bdez, this is formed by suffixing the construct suffix to the possessed noun, which is followed by the possessor, as in the following examples:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAnother common way of indicating possession by a noun phrase combines the pronominal suffix on a noun with the possessor preceded by the preposition /la=/ 'to, for':\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLambdin notes that in comparison to the construct state, this kind of possession is only possible when the possessor is definite and specific. Lambdin also notes that the construct state is the unmarked form of possession in Ge\u02bdez.\nPrepositional phrases.\nGe\u02bdez is a prepositional language, as in the following example:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThere are three special prepositions, /ba=/ 'in, with', /la=/ 'to, for', /\u02bc\u0259m=/ 'from', which always appear as clitics, as in the following examples:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThese proclitic prepositions in Ge\u02bdez are similar to the Hebrew inseparable prepositions.\nSentences.\nThe normal word order for declarative sentences is VSO. Objects of verbs show accusative case marked with the suffix /-a/:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nQuestions with a wh-word ('who', 'what', etc.) show the question word at the beginning of the sentence:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNegation.\nThe common way of negation is the prefix \"\u02bei-\" which descends from \"\u02be\u0259y-\" (which is attested in Axum inscriptions), from earlier *\"\u02beay\", from Proto-Semitic \"*\u02beal\" by palatalization. It is prefixed to verbs as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWriting system.\nGe\u02bdez is written with Ethiopic or the Ge\u02bdez abugida, a script that was originally developed specifically for this language. In languages that use it, such as Amharic and Tigrinya, the script is called \"\", which means script or alphabet.\nGe\u02bdez is read from left to right.\nThe Ge\u02bdez script has been adapted to write other languages, usually ones that are also Semitic. The most widespread use is for Amharic in Ethiopia and Tigrinya in Eritrea and Ethiopia. It is also used for Sebatbeit, Me\u02bcen, Agew, and most other languages of Ethiopia. In Eritrea it is used for Tigre, and it is often used for Bilen, a Cushitic language. Some other languages in the Horn of Africa, such as Oromo, used to be written using Ge\u02bdez but have switched to Latin-based alphabets.\nIt also uses four series of consonant signs for labialized velar consonants, which are variants of the non-labialized velar consonants:\nHistory and literature.\nIn addition to the Bible including the Deuterocanonical books, there are many medieval and early modern original texts. Most important works are also the literature of the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which include Christian liturgy (service books, prayers, hymns), hagiographies, and Patristic literature. For example, around 200 texts were written about indigenous Ethiopian saints from the fourteenth through the nineteenth century. Traditional education was the responsibility of priests and monks. \"The Church thus constituted the custodian of the nation's culture\", says Richard Pankhurst, who describes the traditional education as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Traditional education was largely biblical. It began with the learning of the alphabet, or more properly, syllabary... The student's second grade comprised the memorization of the first chapter of the first Epistle General of St. John in Geez. The study of writing would probably also begin at this time, and particularly in more modern times some arithmetic might be added. In the third stage the Acts of the Apostles were studied, while certain prayers were also learnt, and writing and arithmetic continued. ... The fourth stage began with the study of the Psalms of David and was considered an important landmark in a child's education, being celebrated by the parents with a feast to which the teacher, father confessor, relatives and neighbours were invited. A boy who had reached this stage would moreover usually be able to write, and might act as a letter writer.\nHowever, works of history and chronography, ecclesiastical and civil law, philology, medicine, and letters were also written in Ge\u02bdez.\nSignificant collections of Ethiopian manuscripts are found outside of Ethiopia in France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The collection in the British Library comprises some 800 manuscripts dating from the 15th to the 20th centuries, notably including magical and divinatory scrolls, and illuminated manuscripts of the 16th to 17th centuries. It was initiated by a donation of 74 codices by the Church of England Missionary Society in the 1830s and 1840s, and substantially expanded by 349 codices, looted by the British from the Emperor Tewodros II's capital at Magdala in the 1868 Expedition to Abyssinia. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City has at least two http://.\nOrigins.\nThe Ge\u02bdez language is classified as a South Semitic language, though an alternative hypothesis posits that the Semitic languages of Eritrea and Ethiopia may best be considered an independent branch of Semitic, with Ge\u02bdez and the closely related Tigrinya and Tigre languages forming a northern branch while Amharic, Argobba, Harari and the Gurage languages form the southern branch.\nInscriptions dating to the mid-1st millennium BCE, written in the Sabaean language in the epigraphic South Arabian script, have been found in the kingdom of D\u02bfmt, serving at least as a witness to a presence of speakers of Semitic languages in the region. There is some evidence of Semitic languages being spoken in Eritrea since approximately 2000 BC. Unlike previously assumed, the Ge\u02bdez language is now not regarded as an offshoot of Sabaean or any other forms of Old South Arabian.\nEarly inscriptions in Ge\u02bdez from the Kingdom of Aksum (appearing varyingly in the epigraphic South Arabian script, and unvocalized or vocalized Ethiopic/Ge\u02bdez script) have been dated to as early as the 4th century CE. The surviving Ge\u02bdez literature properly begins in the same century with the Christianization of the Aksum, during the reign of Ezana of Aksum. The oldest known example of the Ge\u02bdez script, unvocalized and containing religiously pagan references, is found on the Hawulti obelisk in Matara, Eritrea. There exist about a dozen long inscriptions dating to the 4th and 5th centuries, and over 200 short ones.\n5th to 7th centuries.\nThe oldest surviving Ge\u02bdez manuscript is thought to be the second of the Garima Gospels, dating to the 5th or 6th century. Almost all transmitted texts from this early \"Aksumite\" period are religious (Christian) in nature, and translated from Greek. Indeed, the range and scope of the translation enterprise undertaken in the first century of the new Axumite church has few parallels in the early centuries of Christian history. The outcome was an Ethiopic Bible containing 81 Books: 46 of the Old Testament and 35 of the New. A number of these Books are called \"deuterocanonical\" (or \"apocryphal\" according to certain Western theologians), such as the Ascension of Isaiah, Jubilees, Enoch, the Paralipomena of Baruch, Noah, Ezra, Nehemiah, Maccabees, and Tobit. The Book of Enoch in particular is notable since its complete text has survived in no other language; and, for the other works listed, the Ethiopic version is highly regarded as a witness to the original text.\nAlso to this early period dates Qerlos, a collection of Christological writings beginning with the treatise of Saint Cyril (known as \"Hamanot Rete\u02bcet\" or \"De Recta Fide\"). These works are the theological foundation of the Ethiopic Church. In the later 5th century, the Aksumite Collection\u2014an extensive selection of liturgical, theological, synodical and historical materials\u2014was translated into Ge\u02bdez from Greek, providing a fundamental set of instructions and laws for the developing Axumite Church. Included in this collection is a translation of the Apostolic Tradition (attributed to Hippolytus of Rome, and lost in the original Greek) for which the Ethiopic version provides much the best surviving witness. Another important religious document is \"Ser\u02bcata Paknemis\", a translation of the monastic Rules of Pachomius. Non-religious works translated in this period include \"Physiologus\", a work of natural history also very popular in Europe.\nThe use of Ge\u02bdez is also known from many excavated inscriptions. Six Ge\u02bdez inscriptions are known from 6th-century South Arabia, from during the reign of Kaleb of Aksum, the Aksumite king who conquered the Himyarite kingdom. They record his military conquests and contain many religious references, including to biblical figures (such as Jesus, Mary, and David) and scriptural quotations (Isaiah 22:22\u201323, Psalms 65:16 and 68:2, Matthew 6:33, and with less certainty, Genesis 15:7).\n13th to 14th centuries.\nAfter the decline of the Aksumites, a lengthy gap follows; Some writers consider the period beginning from the 14th century an actual \"Golden Age\" of Ge\u02bdez literature\u2014although by this time Ge\u02bdez was no longer a living language; in particular in the major enterprise of translating an extensive library of Coptic Arabic religious works into Ge\u02bdez.\nWhile there is ample evidence that it had been replaced by Amharic in the south and by Tigrinya and Tigre in the north, Ge\u02bdez remained in use as the official written language until the 19th century, its status comparable to that of Medieval Latin in Europe.\nAt this time a lot of works of the Beta Israel had been turned into Hebraized (i.e. written in the Hebrew alphabet) Ge\u02bdez, which made the gradual process of Ge\u02bdez being the liturgical language of the Beta Israel.\nThe \"Ethiopic Alexander Romance\" was produced in this period, the most important Ge\u02bdez-language Alexander legend, translated from an earlier Arabic recension of the Alexander Romance work. Important hagiographies from this period include:\nAlso at this time the \"Apostolic Constitutions\" was retranslated into Ge\u02bdez from Arabic. Another translation from this period is Zena \u02bcAyhud, a translation (probably from an Arabic translation) of Joseph ben Gurion's \"History of the Jews\" (\"Sefer Josippon\") written in Hebrew in the 10th century, which covers the period from the Captivity to the capture of Jerusalem by Titus.\nApart from theological works, the earliest contemporary Royal Chronicles of Ethiopia are date to the reign of Amda Seyon I (1314\u201344). With the appearance of the \"Victory Songs\" of Amda Seyon, this period also marks the beginning of Amharic literature.\nThe 14th century \"Kebra Nagast\" or \"Glory of the Kings\" by the Nebura\u02bced Yeshaq of Aksum is among the most significant works of Ethiopian literature, combining history, allegory and symbolism in a retelling of the story of the Queen of Sheba (i.e., Saba), King Solomon, and their son Menelik I of Ethiopia. Another work that began to take shape in this period is the \"Mashafa Aksum\" or \"Book of Axum\".\n15th to 16th centuries.\nThe early 15th century \"Fekkare Iyasus\" \"The Explication of Jesus\" contains a prophecy of a king called \"Tewodros\", which rose to importance in 19th century Ethiopia as Tewodros II chose this throne name.\nLiterature flourished especially during the reign of Emperor Zara Yaqob. Written by the Emperor himself were \"Mats\u02bchafe Berhan\" (\"The Book of Light\") and \"Matshafe Milad\" (\"The Book of Nativity\"). Numerous homilies were written in this period, notably \"Retu\u02bca Haimanot\" (\"True Orthodoxy\") ascribed to John Chrysostom. Also of monumental importance was the appearance of the Ge\u02bdez translation of the Fetha Negest (\"Laws of the Kings\"), thought to have been around 1450, and ascribed to one Petros Abda Sayd \u2014 that was later to function as the supreme Law for Ethiopia, until it was replaced by a modern Constitution in 1931.\nBy the beginning of the 16th century, the Islamic invasions put an end to the flourishing of Ethiopian literature.\nA letter of Abba \u02bcEnbaqom (or \"Habakkuk\") to Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, entitled \"Anqasa Amin\" (\"Gate of the Faith\"), giving his reasons for abandoning Islam, although probably first written in Arabic and later rewritten in an expanded Ge\u02bdez version around 1532, is considered one of the classics of later Ge\u02bdez literature. During this period, Ethiopian writers begin to address differences between the Ethiopian and the Roman Catholic Church in such works as the \"Confession\" of Emperor Gelawdewos, \"Sawana Nafs\" (\"Refuge of the Soul\"), \"Fekkare Malakot\" (\"Exposition of the Godhead\") and \"Haymanote Abaw\" (\"Faith of the Fathers\"). Around the year 1600, a number of works were translated from Arabic into Ge\u02bdez for the first time, including the \"Chronicle\" of John of Nikiu and the \"Universal History\" of George Elmacin.\nCurrent usage in Eritrea, Ethiopia and Israel.\nGe\u02bdez is the liturgical language of Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo, Ethiopian Catholic and Eritrean Catholic Christians and the Beta Israel, and is used in prayer and in scheduled public celebrations.\nThe liturgical rite used by the Christian churches is referred to as the Ethiopic Rite or the Ge\u02bdez Rite.\nSample.\nThe first sentence of the Book of Enoch:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Interlinear/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\nExternal history.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPhonology and grammar.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLiterature.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nDictionaries.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The only living species of the genus and most commonly known, the cheetah (\"A. jubatus\") inhabits the open grasslands of Africa and Asia along with parts of Iran. This genus represents a highly adapted lineage within the felids, which specialize in speed and open-terrain hunting. Evidence suggest the Acinonyx genus evolved from other feline ancestors early on, to become specialized in stealth and running.\nThe main reasons for all but one species going extinct revolve around climate changes, humans driving these species out of their habitats, and their prey populations shrinking. Climate drastically changed starting in the Pleistocene period, making it difficult to survive in open terrain and grasslands upon which these cats depend. Human civilization also began to change and expand resulting in lots of these species to lose their home or hunting grounds. This also forced some species to be isolated making reproducing more difficult. Another factor of humans expanding was the lack of prey for these cats; their prey were eating being hunted by humans or being forced from their habitats. These problems played a huge role in the extinction of the species in the genus Acinonyx other than the cheetah (A. jubatus).\nFossil remains related to cheetah-like cats were excavated that date back to the late Pliocene and Middle Pleistocene, indicating a wide time range. These cats occurred across much of the old world 10,000 years ago, some extinct species such as A. pardinenesis and A. intermedius were found in parts of Europe and Asia. Several similar species classified in the genus \"Miracinonyx\" lived in North America at the same time; these may have been more closely related to the genus \"Puma\".\nA primary characteristic of this genus are bodies adapted for speed and swiftness; however the species at the time were much different in morphology. Species found 10,000 years ago show a large and vigorous build for these cats compared to the modern day Cheetah which has accommodated to fast prey, with a much slimmer build used for a quick pursuit. Species within the Acinonyx genus are also unable to retract their claws fully, this can be a disadvantage in some cases. However claws give extra traction while running.\nTaxonomy.\n\"Acinonyx\" was proposed by Joshua Brookes in 1828.\nThe word Acinonyx is greek, the first portion of \"akinetos\" translates to \"unmoved\" or \"motionless\" and the second portion \"onyx\" translates to \"nail\" or \"claw\". Which represents one the main traits used to recognize this genus, not being able to retract their claws fully.\nBetween the late 18th century and the early 20th century, the following \"Acinonyx\" species and subspecies were described:\nIn 1993, \"Acinonyx\" was placed in the monophyletic subfamily Acinonychinae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis has shown that it is the sister group of the genus \"Puma\", and it is now placed within the subfamily Felinae.\nIn addition, the following fossil \"Acinonyx\" species were described:\nThe Asiatic cheetah (\"Acinonyx jubatus venaticus\") is part of the last surviving lineages that are outside of Africa. Recent genetic studies have shown that this subspecies separated from African populations roughly 32,000 to 67,000 years ago, suggesting a prolonged adaptation to dry landscapes.\nThe \"Linxia Cheetah\" (\"A. kurteni\") was initially described by Christiansen and Maz\u00e1k in 2009 on the basis of a skull from Pliocene strata in China, and touted as the most primitive member of the genus. In 2012, \"A. kurteni\" was invalidated as a species when the holotype was determined to be a forgery composed of Miocene-aged fragments.\nThe extended duration and broad range of fossil records suggests the long evolutionary presence across the old world into the present day. The fossils also suggest how the genus Acinonyx once ranged widely across Eurasia, eventually population declining to climatic shifts and the habitat being broken into different locations due to human activities.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This earned it the description \"le chiffrage ind\u00e9chiffrable\" (French for 'the indecipherable cipher'). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are essentially Vigen\u00e8re ciphers. In 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a general method of deciphering Vigen\u00e8re ciphers.\nIn the 19th century, the scheme was misattributed to Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re (1523\u20131596) and so acquired its present name.\nHistory.\nThe very first well-documented description of a polyalphabetic cipher was by Leon Battista Alberti around 1467 and used a metal cipher disk to switch between cipher alphabets. Alberti's system only switched alphabets after several words, and switches were indicated by writing the letter of the corresponding alphabet in the ciphertext. Later, Johannes Trithemius, in his work \"Polygraphia\" (which was completed in manuscript form in 1508 but first published in 1518), invented the tabula recta, a critical component of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher. The Trithemius cipher, however, provided a progressive, rather rigid and predictable system for switching between cipher alphabets.\nIn 1586 Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re published a type of polyalphabetic cipher called an autokey cipher \u2013 because its key is based on the original plaintext \u2013 before the court of Henry III of France. The cipher now known as the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, however, is based on that originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book \"La cifra del Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso\". He built upon the tabula recta of Trithemius but added a repeating \"countersign\" (a key) to switch cipher alphabets every letter.\nWhereas Alberti and Trithemius used a fixed pattern of substitutions, Bellaso's scheme meant the pattern of substitutions could be easily changed, simply by selecting a new key. Keys were typically single words or short phrases, known to both parties in advance, or transmitted \"out of band\" along with the message, Bellaso's method thus required strong security for only the key. As it is relatively easy to secure a short key phrase, such as by a previous private conversation, Bellaso's system was considerably more secure.\nNote, however, as opposed to the modern Vigen\u00e8re cipher, Bellaso's cipher didn't have 26 different \"shifts\" (different Caesar's ciphers) for every letter, instead having 13 shifts for pairs of letters. In the 19th century, the invention of this cipher, essentially designed by Bellaso, was misattributed to Vigen\u00e8re. David Kahn, in his book, \"The Codebreakers\" lamented this misattribution, saying that history had \"ignored this important contribution and instead named a regressive and elementary cipher for him [Vigen\u00e8re] though he had nothing to do with it\".\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher gained a reputation for being exceptionally strong. Noted author and mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll) called the Vigen\u00e8re cipher unbreakable in his 1868 piece \"The Alphabet Cipher\" in a children's magazine. In 1917, \"Scientific American\" described the Vigen\u00e8re cipher as \"impossible of translation\". That reputation was not deserved. Charles Babbage is known to have broken a variant of the cipher as early as 1854 but did not publish his work. One hypothesis is that he intentionally kept the general method secret, since he was a cryptographical adviser to his friend, Rear-Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort, during the Crimean War. Kasiski entirely broke the cipher and published the technique in the 19th century, but even in the 16th century, some skilled cryptanalysts could occasionally break the cipher.\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher is simple enough to be a field cipher if it is used in conjunction with cipher disks. The Confederate States of America, for example, used a brass cipher disk to implement the Vigen\u00e8re cipher during the American Civil War. The Confederacy's messages were far from secret, and the Union regularly cracked its messages. Throughout the war, the Confederate leadership primarily relied upon three key phrases: \"Manchester Bluff\", \"Complete Victory\" and, as the war came to a close, \"Come Retribution\".\nA Vigen\u00e8re cipher with a completely random (and non-reusable) key which is as long as the message becomes a one-time pad, a theoretically unbreakable cipher. Gilbert Vernam tried to repair the broken cipher (creating the Vernam\u2013Vigen\u00e8re cipher in 1918), but the technology he used was so cumbersome as to be impracticable.\nDescription.\nIn a Caesar cipher, each letter of the alphabet is shifted along some number of places. For example, in a Caesar cipher of shift 3, codice_3 would become codice_16, codice_17 would become codice_18, codice_19 would become codice_20 and so on. The Vigen\u00e8re cipher has several Caesar ciphers in sequence with different shift values.\nTo encrypt, a table of alphabets can be used, termed a \"tabula recta\", \"Vigen\u00e8re square\" or \"Vigen\u00e8re table\". It has the alphabet written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar ciphers. At different points in the encryption process, the cipher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows. The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.\nFor example, suppose that the plaintext to be encrypted is\ncodice_21.\nThe person sending the message chooses a keyword and repeats it until it matches the length of the plaintext, for example, the keyword \"LEMON\":\ncodice_22\nEach row starts with a key letter. The rest of the row holds the letters A to Z (in shifted order). Although there are 26 key rows shown, a code will use only as many keys (different alphabets) as there are unique letters in the key string, here just 5 keys: {L, E, M, O, N}. For successive letters of the message, successive letters of the key string will be taken and each message letter enciphered by using its corresponding key row. When a new character of the message is selected, the next letter of the key is chosen, and the row corresponding to that char is gone along to find the column heading that matches the message character. The letter at the intersection of [key-row, msg-col] is the enciphered letter.\nFor example, the first letter of the plaintext, codice_3, is paired with codice_24, the first letter of the key. Therefore, row codice_24 and column codice_26 of the Vigen\u00e8re square are used, namely codice_24. Similarly, for the second letter of the plaintext, the second letter of the key is used. The letter at row codice_18 and column codice_29 is codice_30. The rest of the plaintext is enciphered in a similar fashion:\nDecryption is performed by going to the row in the table corresponding to the key, finding the position of the ciphertext letter in that row and then using the column's label as the plaintext. For example, in row codice_24 (from codice_32), the ciphertext codice_24 appears in column codice_26, so codice_3 is the first plaintext letter. Next, in row codice_18 (from codice_37), the ciphertext codice_30 is located in column codice_29. Thus codice_6 is the second plaintext letter.\nAlgebraic description.\nVigen\u00e8re can also be described algebraically. If the letters codice_26\u2013codice_42 are taken to be the numbers 0\u201325 (formula_1, formula_2, etc.), and addition is performed modulo 26, Vigen\u00e8re encryption formula_3 using the key formula_4 can be written as\nformula_5\nand decryption formula_6 using the key formula_4 as\nformula_8\nin which formula_9 is the message, formula_10 is the ciphertext and formula_11 is the key obtained by repeating the keyword formula_12 times in which formula_13 is the keyword length.\nThus, by using the previous example, to encrypt formula_1 with key letter formula_15 the calculation would result in formula_16.\nformula_17\nTherefore, to decrypt formula_18 with key letter formula_19, the calculation would result in formula_20.\nformula_21\nIn general, if formula_22 is the alphabet of length formula_23, and formula_13 is the length of key, Vigen\u00e8re encryption and decryption can be written:\nformula_25\nformula_26\nformula_27 denotes the offset of the \"i\"-th character of the plaintext formula_28 in the alphabet formula_22. For example, by taking the 26 English characters as the alphabet formula_30, the offset of A is 0, the offset of B is 1 etc. formula_31 and formula_32 are similar.\nCryptanalysis.\nThe idea behind the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, like all other polyalphabetic ciphers, is to disguise the plaintext letter frequency to interfere with a straightforward application of frequency analysis. For instance, if codice_43 is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English, one might suspect that codice_43 corresponds to codice_45 since codice_45 is the most frequently used letter in English. However, by using the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, codice_45 can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points in the message, which defeats simple frequency analysis.\nThe primary weakness of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher is the repeating nature of its key. If a cryptanalyst correctly guesses the key's length \"n\", the cipher text can be treated as \"n\" interleaved Caesar ciphers, which can easily be broken individually. The key length may be discovered by brute force testing each possible value of \"n\", or Kasiski examination and the Friedman test can help to determine the key length (see below: and ).\nKasiski examination.\nIn 1863, Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a successful general attack on the Vigen\u00e8re cipher. Earlier attacks relied on knowledge of the plaintext or the use of a recognizable word as a key. Kasiski's method had no such dependencies. Although Kasiski was the first to publish an account of the attack, it is clear that others had been aware of it. In 1854, Charles Babbage was goaded into breaking the Vigen\u00e8re cipher when John Hall Brock Thwaites submitted a \"new\" cipher to the \"Journal of the Society of the Arts\". When Babbage showed that Thwaites' cipher was essentially just another recreation of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, Thwaites presented a challenge to Babbage: given an original text (from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\": Act 1, Scene 2) and its enciphered version, he was to find the key words that Thwaites had used to encipher the original text. Babbage soon found the key words: \"two\" and \"combined\". Babbage then enciphered the same passage from Shakespeare using different key words and challenged Thwaites to find Babbage's key words. Babbage never explained the method that he used. Studies of Babbage's notes reveal that he had used the method later published by Kasiski and suggest that he had been using the method as early as 1846.\nThe Kasiski examination, also called the Kasiski test, takes advantage of the fact that repeated words are, by chance, sometimes encrypted using the same key letters, leading to repeated groups in the ciphertext. For example, consider the following encryption using the keyword codice_48:\n Key: ABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCDABCD\n Plaintext: cryptoisshortforcryptography\n Ciphertext: CSASTPKVSIQUTGQUCSASTPIUAQJB\nThere is an easily noticed repetition in the ciphertext, and so the Kasiski test will be effective.\nThe distance between the repetitions of codice_49 is 16. If it is assumed that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, that implies that the key is 16, 8, 4, 2, or 1 characters long. (All factors of the distance are possible key lengths; a key of length one is just a simple Caesar cipher, and its cryptanalysis is much easier.) Since key lengths 2 and 1 are unrealistically short, one needs to try only lengths 16, 8, and 4. Longer messages make the test more accurate because they usually contain more repeated ciphertext segments. The following ciphertext has two segments that are repeated:\n Ciphertext: VHVSSPQUCEMRVBVBBBVHVSURQGIBDUGRNICJQUCERVUAXSSR\nThe distance between the repetitions of codice_50 is 18. If it is assumed that the repeated segments represent the same plaintext segments, that implies that the key is 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. The distance between the repetitions of codice_51 is 30 characters. That means that the key length could be 30, 15, 10, 6, 5, 3, 2, or 1 characters long. By taking the intersection of those sets, one could safely conclude that the most likely key length is 6 since 3, 2, and 1 are unrealistically short.\nFriedman test.\nThe Friedman test (sometimes known as the kappa test) was invented during the 1920s by William F. Friedman, who used the index of coincidence, which measures the unevenness of the cipher letter frequencies to break the cipher. By knowing the probability formula_33 that any two randomly chosen source language letters are the same (around 0.067 for case-insensitive English) and the probability of a coincidence for a uniform random selection from the alphabet formula_34 (&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u204426 = 0.0385 for English), the key length can be estimated as the following:\n formula_35\nfrom the observed coincidence rate\n formula_36\nin which \"c\" is the size of the alphabet (26 for English), \"N\" is the length of the text and \"n\"1 to \"n\"\"c\" are the observed ciphertext letter frequencies, as integers.\nThat is, however, only an approximation; its accuracy increases with the length of the text. It would, in practice, be necessary to try various key lengths that are close to the estimate. A better approach for repeating-key ciphers is to copy the ciphertext into rows of a matrix with as many columns as an assumed key length and then to compute the average index of coincidence with each column considered separately. When that is done for each possible key length, the highest average index of coincidence then corresponds to the most-likely key length. Such tests may be supplemented by information from the Kasiski examination.\nFrequency analysis.\nOnce the length of the key is known, the ciphertext can be rewritten into that many columns, with each column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher. The Caesar key (shift) is just the letter of the Vigen\u00e8re key that was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the Caesar cipher, the letters in the ciphertext can be discovered.\nAn improvement to the Kasiski examination, known as Kerckhoffs' method, matches each column's letter frequencies to shifted plaintext frequencies to discover the key letter (Caesar shift) for that column. Once every letter in the key is known, all the cryptanalyst has to do is to decrypt the ciphertext and reveal the plaintext. Kerckhoffs' method is not applicable if the Vigen\u00e8re table has been scrambled, rather than using normal alphabetic sequences, but Kasiski examination and coincidence tests can still be used to determine key length.\nKey elimination.\nThe Vigen\u00e8re cipher, with normal alphabets, essentially uses modulo arithmetic, which is commutative. Therefore, if the key length is known (or guessed), subtracting the cipher text from itself, offset by the key length, will produce the plain text subtracted from itself, also offset by the key length. If any \"probable word\" in the plain text is known or can be guessed, its self-subtraction can be recognized, which allows recovery of the key by subtracting the known plaintext from the cipher text. Key elimination is especially useful against short messages. For example, using codice_52 as the key below:\nThen subtract the ciphertext from itself with a shift of the key length 4 for codice_52.\nWhich is nearly equivalent to subtracting the plaintext from itself by the same shift.\nWhich is algebraically represented for formula_37 as:\nformula_38\nIn this example, the words codice_54 are known.\nThis result codice_55 corresponds with the 9th through 12th letters in the result of the larger examples above. The known section and its location is verified.\nSubtract codice_56 from that range of the ciphertext.\nThis produces the final result, the reveal of the key codice_52.\nVariants.\nRunning key.\nThe running key variant of the Vigen\u00e8re cipher was also considered unbreakable at one time. For the key, this version uses a block of text as long as the plaintext. Since the key is as long as the message, the Friedman and Kasiski tests no longer work, as the key is not repeated.\nIf multiple keys are used, the effective key length is the least common multiple of the lengths of the individual keys. For example, using the two keys codice_58 and codice_59, whose lengths are 2 and 3, one obtains an effective key length of 6 (the least common multiple of 2 and 3). This can be understood as the point where both keys line up.\nEncrypting twice, first with the key codice_58 and then with the key codice_59 is the same as encrypting once with a key produced by encrypting one key with the other.\nThis is demonstrated by encrypting codice_21 with codice_63, to produce the same ciphertext as in the original example.\nIf key lengths are relatively prime, the effective key length is the product of the key lengths, and hence grows quickly as the individual key lengths are increased. For example, while the effective length of combined key lengths of 10, 12, and 15 characters is only 60 (2x2x3x5), that of key lengths of 8, 11, and 15 characters is 1320 (8x11x15). If this effective key length is longer than the ciphertext, it achieves the same immunity to the Friedman and Kasiski tests as the running key variant.\nIf one uses a key that is truly random, is at least as long as the encrypted message, and is used only once, the Vigen\u00e8re cipher is theoretically unbreakable. However, in that case, the key, not the cipher, provides cryptographic strength, and such systems are properly referred to collectively as one-time pad systems, irrespective of the ciphers employed.\nVariant Beaufort.\nA simple variant is to encrypt by using the Vigen\u00e8re decryption method and to decrypt by using Vigen\u00e8re encryption. That method is sometimes referred to as \"Variant Beaufort\". It is different from the Beaufort cipher, created by Francis Beaufort, which is similar to Vigen\u00e8re but uses a slightly modified enciphering mechanism and tableau. The Beaufort cipher is a reciprocal cipher.\nGronsfeld cipher.\nDespite the Vigen\u00e8re cipher's apparent strength, it never became widely used throughout Europe. The Gronsfeld cipher is a variant attributed by Gaspar Schott to Count Gronsfeld (Josse Maximilaan van Gronsveld n\u00e9 van Bronckhorst) but was actually used much earlier by an ambassador of Duke of Mantua in 1560s-1570s. It is identical to the Vigen\u00e8re cipher except that it uses just a cipher alphabet of 10 characters, corresponding to the digits 0 to 9: a Gronsfeld key of 0123 is the same as a Vigenere key of ABCD. The Gronsfeld cipher is strengthened because its key is not a word, but it is weakened because it has just a cipher alphabet of 10 characters. It is Gronsfeld's cipher that became widely used throughout Germany and Europe, despite its weaknesses.\nVigen\u00e8re\u02bcs autokey cipher.\nVigen\u00e8re actually invented a stronger cipher, an autokey cipher. The name \"Vigen\u00e8re cipher\" became associated with a simpler polyalphabetic cipher instead. In fact, the two ciphers were often confused, and both were sometimes called \"le chiffre ind\u00e9chiffrable\". Babbage actually broke the much-stronger autokey cipher, but Kasiski is generally credited with the first published solution to the fixed-key polyalphabetic ciphers.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In 1496, Philibert's father surprisingly succeeded as Duke, when his underaged grandnephew Duke Charles II of Savoy died, being the male heir of the line of Savoy.\nThe same year, the 16-year-old Philibert married the 9-year-old Yolande Louise of Savoy, his cousin and the only sister of the deceased young duke. She was daughter of Duke Charles I of Savoy, the Warrior, and Blanche of Montferrat, as well as granddaughter of Philibert's late uncle, Duke Amadeus IX of Savoy. She was the heir-general of her brother, father, grandfather, and her grandmother Yolande of France, the eldest surviving daughter of king Charles VII of France. Her birthright, after the death of her brother, was the succession of the kingdoms of Cyprus, Jerusalem, and Armenia although Philibert's father took those titles.\nAfter a brief reign, Philip II died in 1497 and Philibert succeeded as Duke of Savoy. The young couple then at last advanced their claims, and took the titles Queen and King of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia.\nIn 1499, the 12-year-old first wife of Philibert died, childless. Her heir was her first cousin, Princess Charlotte of Naples, later Countess of Laval. Philibert continued to use the titles of Cyprus etc., despite the death of his first wife.\nHis next marriage tied him into the web of alliances around the Habsburgs, who ruled the Netherlands, Alsace, Franche-Comt\u00e9, Tyrol, Austria, etc. In 1501, he married Margaret of Austria, the only daughter of Maximilian I and his first wife Mary of Burgundy, the duchess of Burgundy. She had previously been married to John, Prince of Asturias, heir to the thrones of Aragon and Castile.\nEarly in Philibert's reign, his first cousin Charles VIII of France died in 1498. The next king, Louis XII, would invade Italy the following year and conquer most of Naples. Louis would also conquer Milan, which neighboured Savoy to the east, thus putting the Savoyards between French possessions.\nPhilibert died in 1504 at the age of 24.

The Bruins compete in the National Hockey League (NHL) as a member of the Atlantic Division in the Eastern Conference. The team has been in existence since 1924, making them the third-oldest active team in the NHL, and the oldest in the United States.\nThe Bruins are one of the \"Original Six\" NHL teams, along with the Detroit Red Wings, Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers, and Toronto Maple Leafs. They have won six Stanley Cup championships, tied for fourth-most of any team with the Blackhawks (trailing the Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Red Wings, with 24, 13, and 11, respectively), and tied for second-most for an NHL team based in the United States. The Bruins have also won the Presidents' Trophy four times, with their most recent win in 2022\u201323 having amassed 135 points\u2014the most in one season in NHL history.\nThe first facility to host the Bruins was the Boston Arena (now known as Matthews Arena), the world's oldest (built 1909\u201310) indoor ice hockey facility still in use for the sport at any level of competition. Following the Bruins' departure from the Boston Arena, the team played its home games at the Boston Garden for 67 seasons, beginning in 1928 and concluding in 1995, when they moved to TD Garden.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1924\u20131942).\nIn 1924, the NHL made the decision to expand to the United States. The previous year in 1923, sports promoter Thomas Duggan received options on three NHL franchises for the United States, and sold one to Boston grocery magnate Charles Adams. The team was one of the NHL's first expansion teams, and the first NHL team to be based in the United States. Adams' first act as owner was to hire Art Ross, a former player and innovator, as general manager. Ross, with assistance from his secretary, came up with \"Bruins\" for a team nickname. The team's nickname also went along with the team's original uniform colors of brown and yellow, which came from Adams' grocery chain, First National Stores.\nOn December 1, 1924, the Bruins won the first ever NHL game played in the United States, hosting the Montreal Maroons at Boston Arena, with Smokey Harris scoring the first-ever Bruins goal, spurring the Bruins to a 2\u20131 win. This would be one of the few high points of the season, as the Bruins lost their next 11 games and only managed a 6\u201324\u20130 record, finishing in last place in its first season. The Bruins played three more seasons at the Arena, after which they became the main tenant of Boston Garden.\nThe Bruins improved in their second season to a winning 17\u201315\u20134 record, which originally held the record for the biggest single-season improvement in NHL history. However, they missed out on the third and final playoff berth by one point to the expansion Pittsburgh Pirates.\nIn their third season, Ross took advantage of the collapse of the Western Hockey League (WHL) to purchase several western stars, including the team's first great star, defenseman Eddie Shore. With the Bruins, he would go on to become one of the greatest players in NHL history. Boston qualified for the then-expanded playoffs. In their first-ever playoff run, the Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Final where they lost to the Ottawa Senators. The Stanley Cup-winning game for the Senators would see Bruins' Billy Coutu attack the referee, earning him a ban from the NHL for life, the only in league history.\nThe 1928\u201329 season was the first played at Boston Garden. It also featured the NHL debut of goaltender Tiny Thompson, who assisted the Bruins in defeating the New York Rangers to win their first Stanley Cup.\nIn 1929\u201330, the Bruins posted the best-ever regular season winning percentage in the NHL (.875, a record which still stands) because of a 38\u20135\u20131 record, but lost to the Montreal Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Final. In 1936, owner Charles Adams transferred ownership to his son Weston Adams.\nIn 1939, the team captured its second Stanley Cup. That year, Thompson was traded to make room for rookie goaltender Frank Brimsek. Brimsek had an award-winning season, capturing the Vezina and Calder Trophies, becoming the first rookie named to the NHL first All-Star team, and earning the nickname \"Mr. Zero\". The team skating in front of Brimsek included Bill Cowley, Shore, Dit Clapper and \"Sudden Death\" Mel Hill (who scored three overtime goals in one playoff series), together with the \"Kraut line\" of center Milt Schmidt, right winger Bobby Bauer and left winger Woody Dumart.\nIn the 1939\u201340 season, Shore was traded to the New York Americans for his final NHL season. In 1941, the Bruins won their third Stanley Cup after losing only eight games and finishing first in the regular season. World War II affected the Bruins more than most teams; Brimsek and the \"Krauts\" all enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force following the 1941 Cup win.\nOriginal Six era (1942\u20131967).\nThe NHL had by 1942 been reduced, for the next 25 years, to the six teams that would come to be called the \"Original Six\".\nIn 1944, Bruins' Herb Cain set the then-NHL record for points in a season with 82.\nThe stars returned from World War II for the 1945\u201346 season, and Clapper led the team back to the Stanley Cup Final as player-coach. He retired as a player after the next season, becoming the first player to play twenty NHL seasons. Clapper retired as a player in 1947 then retired as coach in 1949. His retirement as coach came at the same time as goalie Frank Brimsek requesting a trade, to which he was granted one on September 8, 1949.\nOwner Weston began facing financial trouble at the start of the 1950s. He accepted a buyout offer from Walter A. Brown, the owner of the Boston Celtics and the Garden, in 1951. The Bruins did not have regular success during this era, aside from appearances in the 1953, 1957, and 1958 Stanley Cup Final. In 1954, Art Ross retired and Lynn Patrick took over as general manager. During the 1954\u201355 season, an incident occurred between the Bruins and the Montreal Canadiens. Bruins defenseman Hal Laycoe high-sticked Canadiens star Maurice Richard in the head, and Richard went after Laycoe, going as far as punching a linesman to get to Laycoe. Following his removal from the game, the Montreal fans began to riot, only calming down after Richard told them to. On June 3, 1955, the Bruins completed a nine-player trade with the Detroit Red Wings to acquire goaltender Terry Sawchuk as well as forward Marcel Bonin. However, Sawchuk's playing ability would be affected after contracting infectious mononucleosis and he would quit hockey midway through the 1956\u201357 season. On June 10, 1957, Sawchuk was dealt back to the Red Wings in exchange for Johnny Bucyk.\nOn January 18, 1958, the first-ever black NHL player, Willie O'Ree, stepped onto the ice for the Bruins. He played in 45 games for the Bruins over the 1957\u201358 and 1960\u201361 seasons. The \"Uke Line\"\u2014named for the Ukrainian heritage of Johnny Bucyk, Vic Stasiuk, and Bronco Horvath\u2014was formed in 1957 and enjoyed four seasons together until Stasiuk's trade to the Red Wings in 1961.\nAt the 1964 NHL amateur draft, the Bruins drafted Ken Dryden, but traded his rights to the Montreal Canadiens in exchange for two prospects. In 1966, head coach Milt Schmidt took over as general manager as Lynn Patrick retired.\nExpansion and the Big Bad Bruins (1967\u20131979).\nWeston Adams took back ownership the Bruins in 1964 after Brown's death. Adams signed future superstar defenseman Bobby Orr, who entered the league in 1966. Orr was that season's winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy for Rookie of the Year and named to the second NHL All-Star Team. Despite Orr's stellar rookie season, the Bruins would miss the playoffs.\nThe next season, Boston made the playoffs for the first of 29 consecutive seasons, an all-time record. The Bruins then obtained forwards Phil Esposito, Ken Hodge and Fred Stanfield from Chicago in a deal celebrated as one of the most one-sided in hockey history. Esposito, who centered a line with Hodge and Wayne Cashman, became the league's top goal scorer and the first NHL player to break the 100-point mark. With other stars like forwards Bucyk, John McKenzie, Derek Sanderson, and Hodge, defenders like Dallas Smith and goaltender Gerry Cheevers, the \"Big Bad Bruins\" became one of the league's top teams from the late 1960s into the 1980s.\nIn 1970, a 29-year Stanley Cup drought came to an end in Boston as the Bruins defeated the St. Louis Blues in four games in the 1970 Stanley Cup Final. Orr scored the game-winning goal in overtime to clinch the Stanley Cup. The same season was Orr's most awarded; he won his third of eight consecutive Norris Trophies as the top defenseman in the NHL, the Art Ross Trophy, the Conn Smythe Trophy, and the Hart Memorial Trophy, the only player to win those four awards in the same season.\nWhile head coach Harry Sinden temporarily retired from ice hockey before the 1970\u201371 season to enter business (he was replaced by ex-Bruins and Canadiens defenseman Tom Johnson), the Bruins continued to dominate the league. They had seven of the league's top ten scorers (a feat not achieved before or since), set the record for wins in a season, and in a league that had never seen a 100-point scorer before the 1968\u201369 season, the Bruins had four that year. All four (Orr, Esposito, Bucyk and Hodge) were named First Team All-Stars. Boston was favored to repeat as Cup champions but lost to the Ken Dryden-led Canadiens in seven games.\nWhile the Bruins were not quite as dominant the next season, Esposito and Orr finished first and second in the scoring standings and Boston regained the Stanley Cup by defeating the New York Rangers in six games in the 1972 Stanley Cup Final.\nThe 1972\u201373 season saw upheaval for the Bruins. Former head coach Sinden became the general manager. Bruins players Gerry Cheevers, Derek Sanderson, Johnny McKenzie, and Ted Green left to join the World Hockey Association (WHA). Coach Tom Johnson was fired 52 games into the season, replaced by Bep Guidolin. The Adams family, which had owned the team since its founding in the 1920s, sold it to Storer Broadcasting. The Bruins' season came to a premature end in a first-round loss to the Rangers in the 1973 playoffs. In 1974, the Bruins regained their first-place standing in the regular season, along with another 100-point season from Orr, his fifth consecutive. However, they lost the 1974 Stanley Cup Final in an upset to the Philadelphia Flyers.\nDon Cherry stepped behind the bench as the new coach in 1974\u201375. The Bruins stocked themselves with enforcers and grinders, and remained competitive under Cherry's reign, the so-called \"Lunch Pail A.C\"., behind players such as Gregg Sheppard, Terry O'Reilly, Stan Jonathan and Peter McNab. The Bruins placed second in the Adams Division, and lost to the Chicago Black Hawks in the first round of the 1975 playoffs, losing a best-of-three series, two games to one.\nPrior to the 1975\u201376 season, Sportsystem Corporation, composed of current owner Jeremy Jacobs and his two brothers, purchased the Bruins. Continuing with Sinden's rebuilding of the team, the Bruins traded Esposito and Carol Vadnais to the Rangers for Brad Park, Jean Ratelle, and Joe Zanussi. The Bruins made the semifinals again, but lost to the Flyers. Orr left as a free agent to Chicago in the offseason.\nBefore the 1976\u201377 season, the Bruins completed another trade with the Rangers acquiring Rick Middleton for Hodge. Later in the season, Cheevers returned, and the Bruins defeated the Flyers in the semifinals, but were swept by the Canadiens in the Stanley Cup Final. The story repeated itself in 1978\u2014with a balanced attack that saw Boston have 11 players with 20+ goal seasons, still the NHL record\u2014as the Bruins made the Cup Final once more, but lost in six games to Montreal. After that series, John Bucyk retired, holding virtually every Bruins' career longevity and scoring mark to that time.\nThe 1979 semifinals series against the Canadiens proved to be Cherry's undoing. In the deciding seventh game, the Bruins, up by a goal, were called for having too many men on the ice in the late stages of the third period. Montreal tied the game on the ensuing power play and won in overtime. Cherry was dismissed as head coach thereafter.\nRay Bourque era (1979\u20132000).\nThe 1979\u201380 season saw a new head coach Fred Creighton, and also included a trade of goaltender Ron Grahame to the Los Angeles Kings for a first-round pick which was used to select Ray Bourque, one of the greatest defensemen of all-time and the face of the Bruins for over two decades. During this season, an incident between forward Mike Milbury and a fan at a New York Rangers game occurred when Milbury along with other Bruins players entered the stands to engage some of the fans. During the fray, Milbury managed to take off the shoe of a fan and slap him with the heel-end. The incident became known as the Shoe Incident. Creighton was fired with only 15 days remaining in the season due to poor chemistry with general manager Harry Sinden. Sinden hired former goaltender Gerry Cheevers as the next head coach. They had the league's best record in 1982\u201383 behind a Vezina Trophy-winning season from ex-Flyers goaltender Pete Peeters, but fell short of making the Stanley Cup Final.\nFollowing a slow start to the 1986\u201387 season, Sinden fired head coach Butch Goring and replaced him with Terry O'Reilly. At the 1987 NHL entry draft, the Bruins made a trade with the Vancouver Canucks, moving Barry Pederson for right wing Cam Neely. In March 1988, the Bruins acquired the rights to Andy Moog from the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Geoff Courtnall, Bill Ranford, and future considerations. Bourque and Neely led the Bruins to a Stanley Cup Final appearance in 1988 against the Edmonton Oilers, but Boston lost in a four-game sweep.\nThroughout the 1980s, the Bruins often matched up with the Canadiens in either the division semifinals or division finals, with Montreal defeating them five of the six series. In the 1987\u201388 season, the Bruins defeated their nemesis Canadiens in the playoffs en route to their 1988 Stanley Cup Final appearance. It was their first playoff series victory over the Canadiens since 1943, breaking 18 consecutive losses to them. Following the 1988\u201389 season, O'Reilly resigned as head coach to care for his son. Milbury became the head coach soon after.\nUnder Milbury, and with the play of Neely, Bourque, Craig Janney, Bobby Carpenter, rookie Don Sweeney, and goaltender Andy Moog, Boston returned to the Stanley Cup Final in 1990, but again lost to the Oilers, this time in five games. Following Boston's loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the 1991 Wales of Conference final, Milbury resigned as head coach, staying with the team as assistant GM. His replacement, Rick Bowness only coached one season, taking the Bruins to the conference final for the second consecutive season against the Penguins, before his firing after the playoffs. During the 1991\u201392 season, the Bruins acquired Adam Oates in a trade with the Blues for Craig Janney.\nBrian Sutter was hired as the head coach going into the 1992\u201393 season, which also saw Oates score 142 points. Despite finishing with the second-best regular season record after Pittsburgh, Boston was swept in the first round by the Buffalo Sabres\u2014Boston had won all five previous playoff series against Buffalo. The league realigned into different divisions heading into the 1993\u201394 NHL season; the Bruins were placed into the Northeast Division. In the 1994 playoffs, the Bruins were defeated by the New Jersey Devils in the conference semifinals.\nThe 1994\u201395 season was the Bruins' last at the Boston Garden. The final official match played in the Garden was a 3\u20132 loss to the New Jersey Devils in the 1995 playoffs; the Bruins went on to play the final game at the old arena on September 26, 1995, in an exhibition matchup against the Canadiens. They subsequently moved into the FleetCenter, now known as the TD Garden. Prior to the 1995\u201396 Boston Bruins season, Sutter was fired and replaced by Steve Kasper. Ranford was traded back to the Bruins in the 1995\u201396 season, but in the 1996 playoffs, the Bruins lost their first-round series to the Florida Panthers in five games.\nThe team did not fare well in the 1996\u201397 season as they fell to last place in the NHL and Boston missed the playoffs for the first time in 30 years (and for the first time in the expansion era), which set the North American major professional record for most consecutive seasons in the playoffs. With the frustration of the season, Oates said of upper management, \"The guys upstairs aren't doing their jobs... We\u2019re not good enough.\" During the season, they also traded Oates, Ranford, and Rick Tocchet for Jason Allison, Jim Carey, Anson Carter, and two draft picks. Head coach Kasper was fired after the season. The Bruins selected Joe Thornton with the first overall pick in the 1997 NHL entry draft. Pat Burns was hired as head coach in the offseason. He won the Jack Adams Award for coach of the year in the 1997\u201398 season. However, the Bruins lost in the first round of the 1998 playoffs to the Washington Capitals in six games. In the 1999 playoffs, the Bruins defeated the Carolina Hurricanes in six games during the first round. However, they lost to the Sabres in six games in the second round of the playoffs.\nThe new millennium (2000\u20132015).\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, the Bruins finished in last place in the Northeast Division and failed to qualify for the playoffs. During a game between the Bruins and the Vancouver Canucks on February 21, 2000, Marty McSorley was ejected for using his stick to hit Canucks forward Donald Brashear in the head, and subsequently suspended for what resulted in the rest of his career. McSorley was later charged and convicted for assault and sentenced to 18 months probation. Bourque requested a trade to a playoff contender and on March 6, 2000, he was traded to the Colorado Avalanche.\nAlthough the team started the 2000\u201301 season 3\u20130\u20131, after losing four consecutive games, the Bruins fired coach Pat Burns in favor of Mike Keenan. Following Keenan's hiring, Sinden stepped down as general manager, opting to stay as team president. Mike O'Connell took over as general manager. Despite a 15-point improvement over the previous season, they did not make the playoffs and Keenan was let go.\nRobbie Ftorek was hired as the head coach prior to the start of the 2001\u201302 season. The Bruins won their first Northeast Division title since 1993. They lost in six games to the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs. Joe Thornton was made team captain prior to the 2002\u201303 season. During the regular season, he led the team in scoring with 101 points. Head coach Ftorek was fired with nine games remaining in the season and general manager Mike O'Connell took over in interim and into the playoffs, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils in five games. Mike Sullivan made his head coaching debut for the upcoming 2003\u201304 season. At the 2003 NHL entry draft, the Bruins drafted Patrice Bergeron; he made his debut on October 7, 2003. The Bruins won another division title in 2004 and gained a 3\u20131 series lead on the Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs. However, the Canadiens rallied back to win three consecutive games, upsetting the Bruins.\nPrior to the 2004\u201305 NHL lockout, the team drafted David Krejci at the 2004 draft. On November 30, 2005, the Bruins traded Thornton to the San Jose Sharks for Marco Sturm, Wayne Primeau, and Brad Stuart. However, the Bruins struggled to stay consistent throughout the season and with very few transactions to make the team better, Mike O'Connell was fired. Assistant general manager Jeff Gorton took over as interim GM.\nThe 2006\u201307 offseason came with significant front office shake up as Peter Chiarelli was hired as the new general manager of the team on May 26, 2006. Head coach Mike Sullivan was fired and Dave Lewis, former coach of the Detroit Red Wings, was hired to replace him. Sinden, who was team president, resigned on August 9 to become advisor to the owner. At the entry draft, the Bruins selected with the fifth overall pick, Phil Kessel. The Bruins signed defenseman Zdeno Chara and center Marc Savard. Boston also traded Andrew Raycroft for goalie prospect Tuukka Rask. The 2006\u201307 season ended with the team finishing in last place in the division.\nIn the offseason, Lewis was fired as coach and replaced by Claude Julien. The 2007\u201308 campaign saw the NHL debut of Milan Lucic as well as the Bruins finishing 41\u201329\u201312 and making the playoffs, but at the cost of Bergeron missing most of the season with a concussion. The Bruins faced off against their rival Canadiens in another first round matchup. Although the Bruins came back from a 3\u20131 series deficit to tie the series, they were shut out in game seven by Montreal.\nAfter a slow start to the 2008\u201309 season, the Bruins went on to have the best record in the Eastern Conference and qualified for the playoffs for the fifth time in nine years. At the trade deadline, they acquired Mark Recchi from the Tampa Bay Lightning. They faced the Canadiens in the playoffs for the fourth time during that span, defeating Montreal in four games before losing in seven games to the Carolina Hurricanes in the conference semifinals. Goaltender Tim Thomas won the Vezina Trophy as the league's top goaltender in the season. Julien was also awarded the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the year.\nPrior to the start of the 2009\u201310 season, Kessel was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a 2010 and 2011 first round draft pick along with a 2010 second round draft pick. On January 1, 2010, the Bruins won the 2010 Winter Classic over the Philadelphia Flyers in a 2\u20131 overtime decision at Fenway Park, thus becoming the first home team to win an outdoor classic game. In the playoffs, they faced off against the Buffalo Sabres in the conference quarterfinals and emerged victorious in six games. In the conference semifinals, they gained a 3\u20130 series lead over the Philadelphia Flyers. However, they lost the next three games and were forced into game seven. They had a 3\u20130 lead in the game, but the Flyers came back in the game to defeat the Bruins for Boston to become the third team in NHL history to give up a 3\u20130 series lead.\nDue to the Kessel trade and Toronto's poor performance in the 2009\u201310 season, the Bruins were able to use Toronto's pick at select second overall in the 2010 NHL entry draft. They used the pick to select Tyler Seguin. In the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins eliminated the Montreal Canadiens in seven games in the conference quarterfinals. On May 6, the Bruins swept the Philadelphia Flyers in four games to advance to the conference finals for the first time since 1992. Boston then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in seven games and advanced to the Stanley Cup Final for the first time since 1990 to face the Vancouver Canucks. In the Final, the home team won each game with Boston dominating their home games against the Canucks, until game seven which they won in Vancouver 4\u20130 to win their sixth Stanley Cup. Tim Thomas won the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs setting an NHL record with 798 saves made across the playoffs. Thomas also led the league in save percentage with .938, eclipsing Dominik Hasek's record of .937, which earned him his second Vezina Trophy.\nFollowing their Stanley Cup win, Mark Recchi retired. At the 2012 NHL entry draft, the Bruins used the other first round pick in the Kessell trade to select defenseman Dougie Hamilton. The Bruins went on to finish second in the Eastern Conference with 102 points, winning the Northeast Division title, but losing to the Washington Capitals in the first round of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs in seven games.\nDuring the offseason preceding the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout, Tim Thomas made his decision to sit out the 2012\u201313 season; his rights were traded to the New York Islanders on February 7, 2013. Following the Boston Marathon bombing, the game they had on the next day (April 16, 2013) was postponed. On April 17, the Bruins faced off against the Sabres, Boston's first major sporting event since the bombing. At the end of the game both the Sabres players and Bruins players raised their sticks in a salute. In the opening round of the 2013 playoffs, the Bruins took on the Toronto Maple Leafs. Although the Maple Leafs forced game seven after the Bruins were up 3\u20131 in the series, Boston defeated Toronto by coming back from a 4\u20131 deficit in the third period of the game to win in overtime. They went on to beat the New York Rangers in five games and the Pittsburgh Penguins in a four-game sweep to advance to the Stanley Cup Final. However, the Chicago Blackhawks were victorious in the Final, defeating the Bruins in six games.\nOn July 4, 2013, the Bruins completed a blockbuster trade, sending Tyler Seguin along with Rich Peverley and a prospect to the Dallas Stars for Loui Eriksson and three prospects. Amidst the trade, general manager Chiarelli said Seguin needed to \"become more of a professional.\" In the 2013\u201314 season, the Bruins won the Presidents' Trophy after finishing first in the newly formed Atlantic Division with a record of 54\u201319\u20139 for 117 points. However, their regular season success would not translate into another conference finals appearance. Despite winning their first-round series against the Detroit Red Wings, the team fell to the Canadiens in seven games in the second round during the 2014 playoffs.\nIn the 2014\u201315 season, the Bruins finished with a record of 41\u201327\u201314 for 96 points, missing out on the playoffs by just two points. The Bruins became only the third team to miss the playoffs after winning the Presidents' Trophy in the previous season. The 96 points they earned that season broke the record for the most points earned by a team that did not make the playoffs.\nDon Sweeney era (2015\u2013present).\nOn April 15, 2015, Peter Chiarelli was fired by the Boston Bruins. On May 20, the Bruins named former player Don Sweeney as the team's new general manager for the 2015\u201316 season. Part of Sweeney's offseason moves included trading Milan Lucic to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for goalie Martin Jones, forward Colin Miller, and a 2015 first round draft pick. The Bruins would flip Jones to the San Jose Sharks four days later for Sean Kuraly and a 2016 first round pick. The Bruins played in the 2016 NHL Winter Classic against the Canadiens, but lost 5\u20131. One all-time franchise achievement the Bruins attained in the 2015\u201316 season is shared by only their greatest rival, the Canadiens \u2013 a total of 3,000 wins in the team's existence, achieved by the Bruins on January 8, 2016, in a 4\u20131 road victory against the New Jersey Devils. For the first time since the two seasons following the 2004\u201305 lockout, the Bruins did not qualify for the playoffs in two consecutive seasons.\nDuring the last two months of the 2016\u201317 regular season, the Bruins fired head coach Claude Julien and promoted Bruce Cassidy to interim coach. Under Cassidy, the Bruins achieved an 18\u20138\u20131 record through their remaining regular season games, finishing third in the Atlantic Division and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since the 2013\u201314 season. In the first round of the playoffs, the Bruins lost to the Ottawa Senators in six games.\nCassidy returned as head coach for the 2017\u201318 season, leading the Bruins to the playoffs for a consecutive season. They had a record of 50\u201320\u201312, including an 18-game point streak, which lasted from December 14, 2017, to January 25, 2018. They defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round in seven games, but lost to the Lightning in five games in the second round. The season also saw the debuts of Jake DeBrusk and Charlie McAvoy. The Bruins also acquired veteran Rick Nash trading out Ryan Spooner, Matt Beleskey, Ryan Lindgren, and two draft picks.\nDuring the 2018\u201319 season the Bruins finished the regular season in second place in the division with a 49\u201324\u20139 overall record. During the trade deadline, the team acquired Charlie Coyle and Marcus Johansson. In the first round of the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, they faced the Maple Leafs again, defeating them in seven games. In a six-game series, the Bruins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in the second round and advanced to the conference finals for the first time since 2013. The Bruins won the conference finals by sweeping out the Carolina Hurricanes in four games, thus winning the Prince of Wales Trophy and advancing to the 2019 Stanley Cup Final for the third time in 10 years. They faced the St. Louis Blues in a rematch of the 1970 Stanley Cup Final. However, this time the Blues emerged victorious, winning in seven games.\nDuring the 2019\u201320 season, the Bruins consistently had the best record in the Atlantic Division and were near the top of the league. During the trade deadline, they acquired Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie, both from the Anaheim Ducks, in two separate trades. On March 12, 2020, the NHL season was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of the pause, the Bruins were first overall in the league, with 100 points. On May 26, Commissioner Gary Bettman announced that the 2019\u201320 regular season was completed and that the league would resume with the playoffs. The Bruins were awarded the Presidents' Trophy for the second time in a decade, while David Pastrnak's 48 goals made him the first Bruin to win the Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, which he shared with Alexander Ovechkin. During the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Bruins won the first round against the Carolina Hurricanes in five games, but lost to the Tampa Bay Lightning in the second round, also in five games.\nPrior to the beginning of the 2020\u201321 season, Zdeno Chara left as a free agent, signing with the Washington Capitals. Patrice Bergeron was named captain shortly afterwards. As they neared the trade deadline, the Bruins made a trade with the Buffalo Sabres for Taylor Hall and Curtis Lazar. The Bruins made the 2021 playoffs, where they defeated the Capitals in five games but lost to the New York Islanders in six games. In the 2021\u201322 offseason, goaltender Tuukka Rask underwent hip surgery as a free agent. To offset the goaltender loss, they signed free agent Linus Ullmark. However, after signing a one-year deal in January 2022, Rask retired in February. The Bruins clinched the 2022 playoffs as the first wild card team but were defeated by the Hurricanes in seven games. Following the season, head coach Cassidy was fired. They then hired Jim Montgomery, previously the head coach of the Dallas Stars, as their next head coach.\nDuring the 2022\u201323 season, the Bruins broke NHL records and led the Atlantic Division for the entire season. First, they set an NHL record for longest home winning streak from the start of a season (14) from October 15 to December 3. Then on March 2, 2023, the Bruins recorded their 100th standings point of the season in their 61st game, becoming the fastest team to 100 points in NHL history, and surpassing the record previously held by the 1976\u201377 Montreal Canadiens. Nine days later, they set an all-time NHL record as the fastest team to achieve 50 wins, hitting the mark in 64 games compared to a previous record of 66 games held jointly by the 1995\u201396 Detroit Red Wings and 2018\u201319 Tampa Bay Lightning. In that same game, the Bruins became the third-fastest team in history to clinch a playoff spot during the era of 82-game seasons, trailing only the 1995\u201396 Detroit Red Wings (59 games) and the 1998\u201399 Dallas Stars (63 games). On April 9, 2023, the Bruins set the new all-time record for most games won in a season (63), when they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers. Two days later, the Bruins set the new all-time single-season points record (133), when they defeated the Capitals, and they finished the season with 65 wins and 135 points. The Bruins lost to the Florida Panthers in seven games in the opening round of the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs after giving up a 3\u20131 series lead. Hall was traded after the season, and both Patrice Bergeron and David Krejci retired.\nWith Brad Marchand as captain for the 2023\u201324 season, the Bruins finished in second place in the Atlantic Division with 109 points. Lucic also returned to the team on a one-year contract. However, after an injury to his ankle placed him on long-term injured reserve, and an ensuing domestic assault charge, he played no more than four games in the season. In the first round of the 2024 playoffs, the Bruins eliminated their rival, the Toronto Maple Leafs, in seven games. In the second round, they were eliminated by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers again, this time in six games.\nIn the 2024\u201325 season, the Bruins fired Jim Montgomery amidst a slow start and named Joe Sacco as interim head coach. They would trade captain Marchand to the Panthers for a first round pick. They finished in last place in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2016. Ahead of the 2025\u201326 season, the Bruins replaced Joe Sacco with Marco Sturm, making him the 30th head coach in Boston Bruins history.\nTeam information.\nLogo and uniforms.\nSince 1948, the Bruins' logo is an eight-spoked, black and gold wheel with the letter \"B\" in the center, a nod to Boston's nickname of \"The Hub\". The logo has been tweaked numerous times over the course of its history, reaching its current form in 2025. The general design, in use since 1949, features the circle and \"B\" in black with gold spokes; black borders and a gold outer circle were added in 1995 and serifs on the \"B\" were added in 2007. The black borders were removed as part of a logo update in 2025, and a corresponding gold \"B\" version was added for use in dark backgrounds. The block \"B\" logo itself preceded the \"Spoked B\" and was later modified to include serifs as part of their third jersey.\nThe Bruins have also used an alternate logo featuring a walking bear surrounded by the full team name. The logo was first used from 1924 to 1932, and a modernized version was adopted as the team's secondary logo in 2007. This was then updated in 2025 to feature only the bear itself, with the team name variation used on the black uniform, and the city name variation on the white uniform.\nThe Bruins' colors were originally brown and gold. They wore brown uniforms in their maiden season, but switched to a white uniform with alternating brown and gold stripes the next season. The uniforms were paired with beige pants and either gold or white socks. After the 1932 season the walking bear logo was replaced with a simple block \"B\" logo.\nStarting with the 1935\u201336 season, the Bruins replaced brown with black, while also sporting gold socks full-time. The \"B\" logo moved to the sleeves while the uniform number occupied the front. Black pants also replaced the beige pants.\nFor a majority of the 1940s, the Bruins sported gold numbers on the white uniform. From 1940 to 1944 they also wore a gold uniform with a script \"Bruins\" wordmark in front. To commemorate their 25th anniversary, the Bruins released a new white uniform featuring the first iteration of the \"Spoked B\" logo. The gold \"B\" on the logo was crudely drawn inside a black-spoked wheel, with \"24\" and \"49\" added to represent the foundation year and the franchise's 25th year respectively. They also debuted a black uniform with the block \"B\" logo in front.\nBeginning in 1949, the \"B\" on the \"Spoked B\" logo was changed to block lettering. They also brought back the black numbers. With a few cosmetic changes in the stripes and yoke along with the addition of the primitive bear head logo in 1977, the Bruins kept this overall design until 1995.\nIn 1955, the Bruins brought the \"Spoked B\" logo over to the black uniform; they also released a gold jersey with the \"Spoked B\" in front. The black uniform crest would feature an inverse version of the \"Spoked B\", with the gold and black elements reversed, while the gold uniform featured the same logo but in a black circle. During this period, the gold jersey was used as the primary dark uniform while relegating the black uniform (updated with white numbers) into alternate status for several seasons. Also, for a few games between 1958 and 1965, the Bruins wore gold pants.\nIn 1967, the Bruins retired the gold uniforms and reinstated the black uniforms with gold numbers. As with the white uniforms, they endured several cosmetic changes until 1995. The gold socks, which had numerous striping modifications since 1934, was briefly retired in favor of wearing white socks full-time. It was brought back for the 1969\u201370 season and would be paired with the regular black uniforms for the next 47 seasons.\nStarting with the 1995\u201396 season, the Bruins released a new uniform set, featuring the updated \"Spoked B\" logo. The primary uniforms featured a thick contrasting stripe that extended from sleeve to sleeve. In addition, a gold third jersey was released, featuring the infamous \"Pooh Bear\" logo (an homage to Winnie the Pooh). The gold thirds were used until 2006, after which the Bruins wore throwback black uniforms based on the 1970s design.\nMoving to the Reebok Edge template in 2007, the Bruins unveiled new uniforms with the serifed \"Spoked B\" logo. The overall design borrowed a few elements from the 1970s uniforms, and also unveiled a new rendition of the original walking bear logo on the shoulders. The following season, they released new black third jerseys with the aforementioned bear logo in front and the \"Spoked B\" logo on the shoulders.\nFor the 2010 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore a brown and gold variation of the 1948\u201349 design. Then for the 2016 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore a black and gold variation of the original brown uniforms, a design they carried over the following season as an alternate.\nThe Bruins kept much of the same design upon moving to Adidas' AdiZero template in 2017. However, the black uniforms were now paired with black socks, a feature previously reserved on the alternate black uniforms.\nFor the 2019 Winter Classic, the Bruins wore white uniforms with brown and gold stripes and the \"B\" logo in front, paying homage to the mid-1930s uniforms. The simple \"B\" logo also adorned their new black alternate uniform, which was unveiled in the 2019\u201320 season and paid homage to the team's 1950s uniforms.\nPrior to the 2020\u201321 season, Adidas released its \"Reverse Retro\" series of alternate uniforms, which were alternate color renditions of throwback uniform designs. The Bruins' version was taken from the team's 1977 to 1995 design, but with a gold base and black accents. A second \"Reverse Retro\" uniform was released in the 2022\u201323 season, this time featuring a white version of the 1995\u20132006 \"Pooh Bear\" alternates.\nBoston's 2023 Winter Classic uniform mixed various styles from the team's uniform history. The black-based uniform featured gold stripes and vintage white letters. The \"BOSTON\" wordmark was inspired by the 1949 \"Spoked B\" logo, and the original bear head logo from 1977 to 1995 was positioned below.\nFor the 2023\u201324 centennial season, the Bruins unveiled a new set of uniforms, along with a commemorative logo featuring the modern \"Spoked B\" logo minus the gold outer circle and black borders on the spokes and \"B\", closely resembling the original design worn from 1949 to 1995. The white uniform would feature the aforementioned logo, while the black uniform would feature an inverted version, with the \"B\" and circle in gold with black spokes. The gold used on the primary uniforms is a paler shade called \"Centennial gold\" rather than the traditional yellow gold; the yellow gold version remained in use for promotional purposes. In addition, the three gold stripes on each sleeve represented the six Stanley Cups the team has won, which are accented with thin black and thick white stripes. White numbers returned to the black uniform for the first time since the early 1960s and names featured no additional trim. An alternate beige uniform was also released. This design featured a modern take on the first \"Spoked B\" logo worn during the 1948\u201349 25th anniversary season, modified to include the foundation year \"1924\" along the horizontal spoke. The uniform heavily borrowed elements from the 1967\u20131974 uniforms which featured a gold yoke, but with brown and white trim. The brown-accented alternates were worn in all home games against Original Six teams, and a road game each at the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.\nIn a December 1, 2024, game against the Montreal Canadiens, the Bruins wore a commemorative uniform to honor the 100th anniversary of the franchise's first-ever game. The design featured the modernized version of the 1949\u20131995 \"spoked B\" logo worn during the centennial 2023\u201324 season but in the current yellow gold shade, and an inverted color version of the centennial \"walking bear\" patch along the right chest. The uniform was heavily based on the 1981\u20131995 uniforms, albeit with black tips on the gold socks. The collar featured the score of the team's first-ever game against the Montreal Maroons.\nIn June 2025, the team announced a logo change to take effect with the 2025\u201326 season \u2013 the centennial \"Spoked B\" logo as the team's primary logo, with the black \"B\" version applied to the white uniform and the gold \"B\" version applied to the black uniform. The new uniforms were heavily inspired by the 1977\u20131995 uniforms, and featured an updated \"walking bear\" patch on the left shoulder. This bear patch featured the team name on the black uniform, and the city name on the white uniform.\nTraining facilities.\nThe Bruins had trained at Ristuccia Ice Arena in Wilmington, Massachusetts, which was completed in 1986. They moved in September 2016 to Warrior Ice Arena in the Brighton neighborhood of Boston, where they are currently training.\nBruins' mascots.\nBlades the Bruin is an anthropomorphic bear serves as the Bruins' team mascot.\nTeam songs.\nWhen Boston television station WSBK-TV began broadcasting Bruins games in 1967, The Ventures' instrumental rock version of the Nutcracker's overture, known as \"Nutty\", was selected as the opening piece of music for Bruins telecasts.\nOn ice, \"Paree\", a 1920s hit tune written by Leo Robin and Jose Padilla, has been played as an organ instrumental for decades, typically as the players entered the arena just before the start of each period and, for many years, after each Bruins' goal. It was introduced by John Kiley, the organist for the Bruins from the 1950s through the 1980s.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"This is a partial list of the last five seasons completed by the Bruins.

These include Marty Barry in 1933\u201334, Nels Stewart in 1934\u201335, Eddie Shore in 1935\u201336, Red Beattie in 1936\u201337, Bill Cowley in 1944\u201345 and Bobby Bauer in 1946\u201347. Having not acknowledged these captaincies for many years and declining comment on the issue, on September 20, 2023, the team confirmed these captaincies, stating there have been 27 captains in franchise history.\nHead coaches.\nOn June 5, 2025, the Bruins announced the hiring of Marco Sturm as the 30th head coach in team history. Sturm played for the Bruins from 2005 to 2010, and became the first European head coach for the team.\nGeneral managers.\nFollowing the team's failure to make the 2015 playoffs, Peter Chiarelli was fired as general manager on April 15, 2015, with Don Sweeney hired as Chiarelli's replacement on May 20, 2015.\nPresidents.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nOwnership.\nThe team founder Charles Adams owned the team until 1936, at which point he transferred ownership to his son Weston Adams. Weston Adams remained majority owner until 1951, when the Boston Garden-Arena Corporation purchased controlling interest in the team. Under the Garden-Arena Corporation's management, Boston Celtics founder Walter A. Brown ran the team from 1951 until his death in 1964. After Brown's death, Weston Adams returned to the role of team president. In 1969, he was succeeded by his son, Weston Adams, Jr.\nOn December 7, 1973, Storer Broadcasting, owner of WSBK-TV, and the Garden-Arena Corporation agreed to a merger which resulted in Storer acquiring a 100% interest in the Bruins. Adams remained as team president. In August 1975, Storer Broadcasting then sold the team to an ownership group headed by Jeremy Jacobs. Jacobs had to promise to keep Bobby Orr as a condition of the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as to whether it would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it. However, Orr's agent, Alan Eagleson, rejected the deal.\nJacobs represents the club on the NHL's board of governors, and serves on its executive committee, and he has chaired the finance committee. At the NHL board of governors meeting in June 2007, Jacobs was elected chairman of the board, replacing the Calgary Flames' Harley Hotchkiss, who stepped down after 12 years in the position. Jacobs has frequently been listed by the \"Sports Business Journal\" as one of the most influential people in sports in its annual poll and by \"The Hockey News\". His company owns TD Garden and he is partners with John Henry, owner of Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox, in the New England Sports Network (NESN).\nAfter taking over as owner in 1975, the Bruins have been competitive (making the playoffs for 29 consecutive seasons from 1967\u201368 to 1995\u201396, 20 of which were with Jacobs as owner) but have won the Stanley Cup only once, in 2011 and only in his 36th year as owner. Under previous ownerships, the Bruins had won the Stanley Cup five times. Under Jacobs, the Bruins reached the Stanley Cup Final seven times (twice against the Bruins' arch-rival Montreal Canadiens in 1977 and 1978, twice against the Edmonton Oilers in 1988 and 1990, finally winning in 2011 against the Vancouver Canucks, and losing in 2013 and 2019 to the Chicago Blackhawks and St. Louis Blues respectively). Jacobs' management of the team in the past earned him spots on ESPN.com's \"Page 2\" polls of \"The Worst Owners in Sports\", and number 7 on their 2005 \"Greediest Owners in sports\" list. \"Sports Illustrated\" suggested longtime star defenseman Ray Bourque, who had \"often drawn the ire of the NHLPA for his willingness to re-sign with Boston with minimal negotiations over the years\" instead of setting the \"watermark for defenseman salaries\", requested and received a trade in 2000 since the team's \"hardline and spendthrift ways\" meant he would have to make the move to get his elusive Stanley Cup (Bourque holds the record for most games played before winning the Cup). Prior to the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement signed in 2005, fans felt team management was not willing to spend to win the Stanley Cup.\nThe current administrators in the Bruins front office are:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFirst-round draft picks.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTeam and league honors.\nRetired numbers.\nNotes:\nHall of Famers.\nThe Boston Bruins acknowledge an affiliation with 58 inductees to the Hockey Hall of Fame: 52 former players and six builders of the sport.

In addition to players and builders, two broadcasters for the Bruins were also awarded the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame.

{"id": "69524", "revid": "7611264", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69524", "title": "Charles Emmanuel I", "text": "Duke of Savoy from 1580 to 1630\nCharles Emmanuel I (; 12 January 1562 \u2013 26 July 1630), known as the Great and nicknamed (; \"Hothead\", a sobriquet attributed to his aggressive and rash military character), was the Duke of Savoy and ruler of the Savoyard states from 30 August 1580 until his death on 26 July 1630, nearly 50 years later. At the time of his death, he was the longest-reigning Savoyard monarch, a record later surpassed by his great-grandson Victor Amadeus II.\nA bold and ambitious ruler, Charles Emmanuel sought to expand Savoyard influence throughout northern Italy during a period marked by the French wars of religion, the Thirty Years' War, and intense rivalry between France and Spain. He led multiple military campaigns \u2013 annexing Saluzzo, Trino and Alba but losing Pinerolo and some transalpine territories \u2013 and often played European powers against each other in complex diplomatic maneuvers. He was also a patron of the arts and a writer himself.\nHis campaigns against Spanish influence contributed to the emergence of early Italian nationalist sentiment in 17th-century poetry and political discourse.\nBiography.\nCharles was born in the Castle of Rivoli in Piedmont, the only child of Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy and Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry. He succeeded his father as duke on 30 August 1580.\nHis father was a devout Catholic and advised Charles to follow in his footsteps:\nMy son, I urge you above all to be a true friend and devout servant of God and His holy Catholic religion, as were your ancestors. Never begin anything without first asking His favor and help, for while we men know little, that Majesty sees all and is eternal wisdom. So long as you rely on Him, you will be safe.\nWell-educated and intelligent, Charles spoke Italian, French, Spanish, as well as Latin. He proved an able warrior although short and hunchbacked.\nConflict against France, Geneva and Swiss cantons.\nIn the autumn of 1588, taking advantage of the civil war weakening France, he occupied the Marquisate of Saluzzo, which was a French possession since 1548. \nThe new king, Henry IV, demanded the restitution of that land, but Charles Emmanuel refused, and war ensued. Geneva and Swiss cantons joined the French coalition. However, the offensive against Savoy was repelled (April 1589) and Bern signed a truce (October 1589). In 1590, Charles Emmanuel sent an expedition to Provence in the interests of the Catholic League, and followed it himself later, but the peace of 1593, by which Henry of Navarre was recognized as king of France, put an end to his ambitions.\nOn 1 August 1591, the Duke of Savoy appointed Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Medrano as his Secretary of State and War, Medrano's expertise in diplomacy and military strategy would have greatly benefited the duchy's political and military endeavours. The broader conflict involving France and Spain ended with the Peace of Vervins (2 May 1598), which left the current but separate question of Saluzzo unsolved. After the Duke started talks with Spain, Henry threatened to return to war until, with the Treaty of Lyon (17 January 1601), Saluzzo went to Savoy in exchange for Bresse, Bugey, and Gex.\nHaving made peace with France, Charles Emmanuel attacked the city of Geneva. On 11 December that year, he led his troops to the city during the night and they surrounded the city walls by two in the morning. The Savoyard cuirassiers were ordered to dismount and climb the city walls in full armour as a shock tactic. However, the alarm was raised by a night watchman and Geneva's militia rose to meet the invaders. The attempted raid failed with 54 Savoyards killed and many more captured. Charles Emmanuel's army retreated in a panic and the Savoyard prisoners were executed. The heavy helmets worn by Charles Emmanuel's troops, with visors made in a stylized imitation of a human face, were known as \"Savoyard\" helmets after this notorious incident. A number of these suits of armour were captured by the Swiss and kept as trophies. The Geneva militia's successful defence of the city's walls is still celebrated as an act of heroism during the annual festival of \"L'Escalade\". The treaty of St. Julien in July 1603 ended the conflict between Savoy and Geneva, with each side restoring occupied territories to the other.\nOration of the Duke.\nThe Duke's Secretary of State and War, Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez de Medrano, wrote an important political treatise titled \"Republica Mista\", published in Madrid in 1602, which contains a rare and accurate record of the Duke of Savoy's oration during the French War of Religion. An excerpt reads:\nIf the lord has the authority to command his vassals, and the vassals are obliged to obey the lord in matters not against God, how much more so in matters that serve Him, glorify Him, and are for your own well-being? For over six hundred years, your ancestors have lived under mine, in Christian faith and obedience to the Catholic, Apostolic, and Roman Church, building temples and observing sacraments for our salvation. How can you abandon your noble and ancient lineage, the honor of your Catholic heritage, and the religion embraced by your ancestors? By aligning with heretics\u2014those who, abandoning God\u2019s Church, have chosen false associations\u2014you now become adversaries of Christ and allies of Satan. There is but one true faith, one Church, and one shepherd: the Roman Pontiff. Do you not see that false religions have sown discord, creating factions and undermining both spiritual and temporal authority? A prince must protect the Catholic faith, for without a strong religion, no empire can remain powerful. Religion and arms united ensure the survival of a monarchy for ages. Let us remember: \"'What is best must be honored by the best, and what rules must be served by the ruler\".' Turn back to the true faith of your forebears and embrace the unity of Christ's Church, lest you lose the peace and salvation promised to those who remain faithful.\nCandidate for the Serbian crown.\nCharles Emmanuel was one of the most wanted candidates for the crown of a restored Serbian kingdom, hypothetically presumed after a Christian crusade against the Ottoman Empire during planning for the Great Conspiracy of the late 16th and early 17th centuries under the auspices of Serbian Patriarch Jovan, diplomat Damjan, Herzegovinian Duke Grdan and other chiefs of the Serb clans. At the 1608 Council of Mora\u010da, during a gathering of representatives of the Serb clans and the Serbian Church, Charles was elected \"King of Serbia\" and invited to convert to Eastern Orthodoxy (as a precondition for being crowned by Patriarch John) and to vow to protect Orthodox Christianity. The conspirators, bearing closely in mind the failures of the 1590 decade, did not want to expose themselves in any action before direct support from the West was forthcoming. Thus no broad uprising of the Balkan Christian peoples against the rule of the Ottoman Turks was sparked, as Charles Emmanuel lacked the financial resources to take the crown and restore the Serbian statehood extinguished in the 15th century.\nIn 1609, Charles Emmanuel came in contact with Albanian mercenaries like Giovanni Renesi, his brother Demetrio Renesi and a relative Don Joanne Renesi, who intended to revolt against the Ottomans at the Convention of Ku\u00e7i in 1614.\nAlliance with France.\nWith the Treaty of Bruzolo (25 April 1610), Charles Emmanuel allied with France against Spain, but the assassination of Henry IV changed the situation, as the treaty was not recognized by Marie de' Medici, who immediately assumed the regency for Henry's son Louis XIII, a minor. Continuing his intrigues, on the death in 1612 of Duke Francesco IV Gonzaga of Mantua, who was lord of the Duchy of Montferrat, Charles Emmanuel caused the war of the Montferrat Succession by assaulting that district. This arrayed the Venetians, Tuscany, the Empire and Spain against him, and he was obliged to relinquish his conquest. However, as Charles Emmanuel refused the Spanish request to unilaterally disarm, war continued between Savoy and Spain. Charles Emmanuel defended Asti and then obtained the help of French troops again in January 1617, as the new king of France resumed his father's alliance with Savoy. The conflict overlapped with the Uskok War, during which Chales Emmanuel sided with the Republic of Venice against Austria and Spain. The two wars were solved by a compromise signed in Paris and Madrid (September 1617): both Spain and Savoy disarmed and restored each other the occupied territories, while an Imperial tribunal would solve the issue on the Montferrat succession; the Uskoks were expelled from their strongholds.\nThe sister of Louis XIII, Christine Marie, was married to Charles Emmanuel's son, Victor Amadeus in 1619.\nCharles Emmanuel took part in the Valtellina War (1620\u20131626) on the side of the Grisons and France against Spain. He tried with French help to obtain access to the Mediterranean Sea at the expense of Genoa. After Spanish intervention, Genoa was relieved. Charles then successfully defended Verrua Savoia in a long siege by Spanish troops. The Valtellina conflict ended with another compromise: the Treaty of Mon\u00e7on. The possession of Valtellina was confirmed to the Grisons, with the region keeping its religious autonomy.\nShifting alliances and death.\nWhen the French occupied Casale Monferrato during the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1628, Charles Emmanuel allied again with Spain. During the war, he annexed Trino and Alba to the Savoyard state. However, when Richelieu invaded Piedmont and conquered Susa, the duke changed sides again and returned to an alliance with France. Then, after Philip IV of Spain sent two invasion forces from Genoa and Como under Ambrogio Spinola, Charles Emmanuel declared himself neutral.\nDuring the war, also in 1628 Giovanni Antonio Ansaldo, an agent of Charles Emmanuel, recruited and furnished with ample funds a group of Genoese conspirators led by Giulio Cesare Vachero who were to overthrow the Republic of Genoa and place the city under the protection of the Duchy of Savoy. The plot failed and Vachero and his accomplices were sentenced to death.\nin 1630, Richelieu ordered a French army to march into Savoy to force the duke to abandon his neutrality. The French troops, soon backed by another army, occupied Pinerolo and Avigliana and defeated the Savoy army under his son Victor Amadeus in Lower Valsusa.\nThe duke died suddenly of a stroke, while campaigning during the second Monferrato war, at Savigliano in late July. He was succeeded by his son Victor Amadeus.\nMarriage and issue.\nIn 1585, Charles married Catherine Michaela of Spain, daughter of Philip II of Spain and Elizabeth of Valois. They had:\nIn Riva di Chieri on 28 November 1629, he secretly married his long-time and official mistress, Marguerite de Rossillon, \"Marchesa\" di Riva di Chieri (bap. 24 December 1599 \u2013 10 November 1640), with whom he had four children, legitimised after the wedding but without succession rights:\nIn addition, he had several illegitimate children:\n\u2014 With Luisa de Duyn Mar\u00e9chal, daughter of Jean-Marie de Duyn, called Mar\u00e9chal, baron of Val d'Is\u00e8re:\n\u2014 With Virginia Pallavicino:\n\u2014 With Argentina Provana, daughter of Giovanni Francesco Provana, count of Bussoleno and Collegno, and Anna Maria Grimaldi:\n\u2014 With Anna Felizit\u00e0 Cusani:\n\u2014 With unknown mistress:\nLegacy.\nCharles Emmanuel's military campaigns ignited Italian nationalism and patriotism.\nAlessandro Tassoni took up the defence of Charles Emmanuel. In quick succession he published anonymously two \"Filippiche\" addressed to the Italian nobility. He exhorted the nobles to discard their lethargy, unite and instead of fighting each other, join Savoy in ridding Italy of Spanish hegemony.\nAt about the same time that Tassoni was inspired to write the \"Filippiche\", Fulvio Testi, a young poet at the court of the duke of Este, published a collection of poems dedicated to Charles Emmanuel. Not all the poems were of a patriotic nature, but those that were, clearly revealed the feelings Charles Emmanuel had stirred in freedom-loving Italians.\nVittorio Siri still reminisced more than fifty years later:\nAll Italy broke forth with pen and tongue in praises and panegyrics at the name of Carlo Emanuele, and in demonstrations of joy and applause that he had revived [...] the ancient Latin valor, wishing that he [...] [might] one day become the redeemer of Italy's freedom and the restorer of its greatness.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was also known as the \"Lion of Susa\". \nHe was succeeded by two of his sons; Francis Hyacinth and Charles Emmanuel II. His male-only line became extinct in 1831 with the death of Charles Felix. Therefore, the Kings of Italy are descended from his younger brother, Thomas Francis.\nBiography.\nVictor Amadeus was born in Turin, Piedmont, as the second son and child of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy and Catherine Micaela of Spain, daughter of King Philip II of Spain. He spent much of his childhood in Madrid at the court of his grandfather Philip II. He stayed there until the king's death in 1598, when Victor Amadeus was eleven. As the second son of the Duke, he was not expected to become Duke of Savoy. That changed when his brother, Filippo Emanuele, died in 1605, thus he became heir-apparent to the Duchy of Savoy and received the homage of the court at Racconigi on 21 January 1607.\nVictor Amadeus became Duke of Savoy after his father's death in 1630. Charles Emmanuel's policies had brought great instability in the relationships with both France and Spain, and troops were needed to defend the Duchy. As money was lacking to recruit mercenaries or train indigenous soldiers, Victor Amadeus signed a peace treaty with Spain.\nWith the Treaty of Cherasco, Savoy was forced to give Pinerolo to France. This gave France a strategic route into the heart of Savoy territory and on into the rest of Italy. The rulers of Savoy from that point resented this loss and worked for decades with the goal of regaining that loss. Subsequently, under the direction of Cardinal Richelieu, Victor Amadeus attempted to create an anti-Spanish league in Italy. He achieved two victories against the Spanish: In 1636 in the Battle of Tornavento and on 8 September 1637 in the Battle of Mombaldone.\nDeath.\nOn 25 September 1637, Victor Amadeus fell ill after a dinner offered by the Duke of Cr\u00e9qui. A prominent Savoyard noble (Count Augusto Manfredo Scaglia di Verrua) who attended the dinner also died in the same week, arousing suspicions of poisoning and generating uncertainty in Savoyard-French relations. The duke was carried to Vercelli, where he died on 7 October, aged 50. He was first succeeded by his elder son, Francis Hyacinth. However, Francis died the following year, and his younger son, Charles Emmanuel, became Charles Emmanuel II of Savoy.\nMarriage and issue.\nIn 1619, he married Christine Marie of France (1606\u20131663), a daughter of Henry IV of France and Marie de' Medici.

He was also Marquis of Saluzzo, Count of Aosta, Geneva, Moriana and Nice, as well as claimant king of Cyprus, Jerusalem and Armenia. At his death in 1675, his second wife Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Savoy-Nemours acted as regent for their 9-year-old son.\nBiography.\nHe was born in Turin to Victor Amadeus I, Duke of Savoy, and Christine of France. His maternal grandparents were Henry IV of France and his second wife Marie de' Medici. In 1638 at the death of his older brother Francis Hyacinth, Duke of Savoy, Charles Emmanuel succeeded to the duchy of Savoy at the age of 4. His mother governed in his place, and even after reaching adulthood in 1648, he invited her to continue to rule. Charles Emmanuel continued a life of pleasure, far away from the affairs of state.\nHe became notorious for his persecution of the Vaudois (Waldensians) culminating in the massacre of 1655, known as Piedmontese Easter. The massacre was so brutal that it prompted the English poet John Milton to write the sonnet \"On the Late Massacre in Piedmont\". Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector, called for a general fast in England and proposed to send the British Navy if the massacre was not stopped while gathering funds for helping the Waldensians. Sir Samuel Morland was commissioned with that task. He later wrote \"The History of the Evangelical Churches of the Valleys of Piemont\" (1658). The 1655 massacre was only the beginning of a series of conflicts, the Savoyard\u2013Waldensian wars (1655\u20131690), that saw Waldensian rebels use guerrilla warfare tactics against ducal military campaigns to enforce Roman Catholicism upon the entire population.\nOnly after the death of his mother in 1663, did he really assume power. He was not successful in gaining a passage to the sea at the expense of Genoa (Second Genoese\u2013Savoyard War, 1672\u20131673), and had difficulties in retaining the influence of his powerful neighbour France.\nBut he greatly improved commerce and wealth in the Duchy, developing the port of Nice and building a road through the Alps towards France. He also reformed the army, which until then was mostly composed of mercenaries: he formed instead five Piedmontese regiments and recreated cavalry, as well as introducing uniforms. He also restored fortifications. He constructed many beautiful buildings in Turin, for instance, the Palazzo Reale.\nHe died on 12 June 1675, leaving his second wife as regent for his son. He is buried at Turin Cathedral. \nIn 1672, the duke had allowed Hortense Mancini (1646-1699) to take refuge in Chamb\u00e9ry. She was fleeing from an unhappy marriage to Armand Charles de La Porte, 2nd Duke of La Meilleraye and needed protection. As a young man the duke had unsuccessfully sought her hand in marriage and it is possible that an affair began at this time. Goldsmith notes, \"Charles-Emmanuel\u2019s delight in hosting the runaway Duchess Mazarin quickly developed into an obsessive fascination once he became more closely acquainted with her.\u201d \nHowever, her presence at court led to tension with supporters of the duchess Marie Jeanne Baptiste de Savoie. Goldsmith notes, \"Members of the court who favored the Savoyard duchess, who found herself eclipsed in her husband\u2019s attentions by the exotic Hortense, were quick to pick quarrels with Hortense and her circle.\" When the duke died, his wife became regent and made it clear that Hortense was not welcome in the kingdom any longer. She left Savoy in October 1675.\" \nMarriages and issue.\nCharles Emmanuel first met Marie Jeanne of Savoy in 1659 and fell in love with her. However, his mother disagreed with the pairing, and encouraged him to marry Fran\u00e7oise Madeleine d'Orl\u00e9ans, daughter of his maternal uncle Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, the younger brother of his mother Christine Marie. They were married on 3 April 1663. The couple had no issue. His mother died at the end of 1663, and his first wife died at the start of 1664. This left him free to get married on 20 May 1665 to Marie Jeanne of Savoy. They had one son:\nFrom his relationship with Jeanne Marie Benso (n\u00e9e de Tr\u00e9cesson), Marchioness of Cavour (the wife of Maurizio Pompilio Benso, Marquess of Cavour), he had a daughter, Cristina Ippolita of Savoy (1655\u20131730), who married Carlo Besso Ferrero Fieschi, 4th Prince of Masserano.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the first of his house to acquire a royal crown, ruling first as King of Sicily (1713\u20131720) and then as King of Sardinia (1720\u20131730). Among his other titles were Duke of Savoy, Duke of Montferrat, Prince of Piedmont, Marquis of Saluzzo and Duke of Aosta, Maurienne and Nice.\nLouis XIV arranged his marriage in order to maintain French influence in Savoy, but Victor Amadeus soon broke away from the influence of France. At his father's death in 1675, his mother, Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Nemours, was regent in the name of her nine-year-old son and would remain in \"de facto\" power until 1684 when Victor Amadeus banished her further involvement in the state. Having fought in the War of the Spanish Succession, he was rewarded with the Kingdom of Sicily in 1713, but he was forced to exchange this title for the poorer Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720.\nReigning for over 55 years, he is the longest-reigning monarch in Savoyard history, surpassing Charles Emmanuel I. Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural influence in Turin, remodeling the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi, as well as building the Basilica of Superga where he rests.\nInfancy and regency.\n Victor Amadeus was born in Turin to Charles Emmanuel II, Duke of Savoy and his second wife Marie Jeanne Baptiste of Nemours. Named after his paternal grandfather Victor Amadeus I he was their only child. As an infant he was styled as the \"Prince of Piedmont\", traditional title of the heir apparent to the duchy of Savoy. A weak child, his health was greatly monitored. As an infant he had a passion for soldiers and was noted as being very intelligent.\nHis father died in June 1675 in Turin at the age of forty after a series of convulsive fevers. His mother was declared Regent of Savoy and, known as \"Madame Royale\" at court, took power. In 1677, during her regency, she tried to arrange a marriage between Victor Amadeus and his first cousin Infanta Isabel Lu\u00edsa of Portugal, the presumptive heiress of her father, Peter II and Victor Amadeus' aunt. His mother urged him to agree to the marriage, as this would have left Marie Jeanne permanently in control of the Duchy of Savoy as Regent because her son would have had to live in Portugal with his new wife. The duchy would then revert to the Kingdom of Portugal at her death. Victor Amadeus refused, and a party was even formed which refused to recognise his leaving Savoy. Despite a marriage contract being signed between Portugal and Savoy on 15 May 1679, the marriage between Victor Amadeus and the Infanta came to nothing and was thus cancelled.\nOther candidates included Maria Antonia of Austria, Countess Palatine of Neuburg and Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici. Victor Amadeus was keen on the match with Tuscany and negotiations were kept secret from France even though the match never happened. Under the influence of Louis XIV and Marie Jeanne, Victor Amadeus was forced to marry a French princess Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans. His mother was keen on the match and had always promoted French interests having been born in Paris a member of a cadet branch of the House of Savoy. He asked for Anne Marie's hand in March 1684, Victor Amadeus, who had been using political allies to gain support to end his mother's grip on power, succeeded in 1684 when she was banished from further influence in the state.\nSalt wars.\nA significant event of his mother's regency was the \"Salt Wars\" of 1680. These rebellions were caused by the unpopular taxes on salt in all cities in Savoy. The system had been put in place by Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy to raise money for the crown. The annual payment of a tax which had been in place for over 100 years caused great discontent and rebellion finally broke out in Mondov\u00ec, where the people refused to pay taxes to the emissary of Savoy, Andrea Cantatore di Breo. The unrest caused an army to be sent to stop the unrest in the town, which was pacified quickly. However, in the town of Montaldo, the unrest began again and was more serious than before. 200 soldiers were killed in warfare which lasted for several days.\nThe news of these rebellions soon reached a wider scope and it became clear that soon the whole of Piedmont was on the verge of revolt. Power at this point still being with Victor Amadeus' mother, she ordered representatives of the town of Mondov\u00ec to go to Turin to conclude treaties and were cordially welcomed by the young Victor Amadeus, who agreed to the treaties. The event had allowed Victor Amadeus a chance to exert some power.\nDuke of Savoy.\nHaving succeeded in ending his mother's power in Savoy, Victor Amadeus looked to his oncoming marriage with the youngest child of Philippe I, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (brother of Louis XIV) and Henrietta of England. The contract of marriage between Anne Marie and the Duke of Savoy was signed at Versailles on 9 April; On 10 April 1684, Anne Marie was married at Versailles, by proxy, to Victor Amadeus. The couple were married in person on 6 May 1684.\nThe Vaudois.\nAt the urging of Louis, Victor Amadeus II began a large-scale persecution of the Vaudois (Piedmontese and Savoyard Protestants) in 1685. The state had been bankrupted due to various conflicts and a famine in 1679 which had used all last resources. Due to his alliances with England and the Dutch Republic during the Nine Years' War, he was forced to cease this practice from 1688, and in 1694 granted an Edict of Toleration. However, in 1698 Louis XIV forced him to expel all Protestant immigrants from Savoy in accordance with a treaty of 1696.\nDuring this period he became anxious to free himself of domination by Louis, and his first sign of independence was his independent visit to Venice in 1687, where he conferred with Prince Eugene of Savoy and others. Louis discovered this and demanded that Victor Amadeus launch another expedition against the Vaudois; he grudgingly complied, but as described below soon chose the allies countering France.\nInternal reforms.\nVictor Amadeus II undertook sweeping administrative reforms within Savoy. In 1696 he established a system of intendants, based on the French model, responsible for collecting taxes and law enforcement. In 1697 he began a land survey which was largely completed by 1711, the Perequazione, to examine the land holdings and privileges of the Church and nobility. In 1717 he reformed the secretariat system in Turin establishing individual secretaries for war, internal affairs and foreign affairs. From the 1670s he also had a new administrative zone built in Turin, around the ducal palace. This zone included a military academy, the ministry of war, a mint, and a customs house. This work was still ongoing upon his death.\nVictor Amadeus also undertook a number of military reforms. Often when one of his key fortresses was under attack, he would replace its commanding officer with one of his most reliable and trusted leaders. In 1690 he established a select militia within his territories, and he later overhauled the militia system in 1714 and strictly codified it. This included an obligation for each region under his rule to provide some men for the militia based on population. From 1713 he also began to establish his own navy based on the limited Sicilian naval forces he had been granted.\nVictor Amadeus was able to use the experienced armies he developed in foreign wars to establish more firm control within his territories. Faced with rebellion by Mondov\u00ec at the end of the century, he brought a force of veterans from the Nine Years War there and re-established his authority. He employed a similar strategy against an anti-tax riot in Cigliano in 1724.\nForeign affairs.\nUnder his mother's regency Savoy, despite being a state of the Holy Roman Empire, was closely linked to and heavily dependent upon France, essentially becoming a French satellite. Victor Amadeus II broke this link by joining alliances against France in both the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession. Savoy was considered a valuable ally in both wars due to its geographical position, enabling a second front to be opened against France in the south. Savoy relied heavily on foreign subsidies, particularly from England and the Dutch Republic, in both wars to maintain its armies.\nNine Years' War.\nAt the start of the Nine Years' War, Savoy had three regiments in the service of France in Flanders. Victor Amadeus struggled throughout the early part of the war to bring those troops back to his own use. Part of the agreement he reached with the Grand Alliance against France was that they would enable him to recover Pinerolo, which his predecessor and namesake had lost decades before. In 1692, he was the only member of the Grand Alliance to bring the war to French lands, invading the Dauphin\u00e9. In 1695 and 1696, he secretly negotiated a separate treaty with Louis XIV of France which included the return of Pinerolo to Savoy. Throughout the war, he greatly increased the size of the army of Savoy from about 8,500 to more than 24,000.\nWar of the Spanish Succession.\nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession, foreign subsidies amounted to almost half of the revenue raised by Savoy to fight the war. The end of the Nine Years' War had helped to design a new balance on the continent: at the death of the childless Charles II of Spain he left his throne to Philip, grandson of Louis XIV. The will stated that should Philip not accept it would go to his brother Charles. Victor Amadeus was himself in line to succeed, as a great-grandson of Infanta Catherine Michaela of Spain. As a result, Victor Amadeus expected compensation in the form of a territory which had been owned by the vast Spanish empire. Victor Amadeus had his eye on the Duchy of Milan which, having signed a treaty with Louis XIV, had support in conquering the duchy. With the Treaty of Vigevano in October 1696, however, Louis XIV's support waned. Victor Amadeus subsequently allied himself with Emperor Leopold I.\nEngland and Austria ignored his claim, the latter of which had a candidate in the person of Archduke Charles, who immediately proclaimed himself King of Spain. The Grand Duke of Tuscany also ignored his claims. In the meantime, he pursued the expansion of Savoy and bought various fiefdoms of the Holy Roman Empire.\nVictor Amadeus was in a position where on most sides of Savoy was a Bourbon ruler, the enemy of Philip V, and he was forced to let French troops enter his lands in order to get Milan which Victor Amadeus had wanted so greatly. Forced to ally himself again this time with Louis XIV and his grandson in Spain, his daughter Maria Luisa was used as a pawn to seal this alliance. His daughter subsequently married Philip V in 1701. In 1701, he fought bravely at the Battle of Chiari, fought in the name of Bourbon control of Milan. By 1702, Victor Amadeus was considering changing allegiance to the emperor again having entered secret correspondence with the emperor who promised him the Duchy of Montferrat. In order to appease him, the emperor increased his bribe, adding various territories in Lombardy, Victor Amadeus having ignored him.\nIn 1703, Victor Amadeus switched sides, joining the Grand Alliance as he had in the Nine Years' War. Savoy fared particularly badly against the larger French forces resulting in a siege of Turin in 1706. Anne Marie's uncle, Louis XIV (along with Spanish forces from Anne Marie's second cousin Philip V of Spain), besieged Turin during the \"Battle of Turin\". French troops were under the control of Anne Marie's half-brother, the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. She and her sons were forced to flee Turin with the grandmother for the safety of Genoa. Turin was saved by the combined forces of Victor Amadeus and Prince Eugene of Savoy in September 1706.\nKing of Sicily.\nAs a result of his aid in the War of the Spanish Succession, Victor Amadeus II gained the Kingdom of Sicily in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war. Being crowned King of Sicily in Palermo on 24 December 1713, he returned to Turin in September 1714. \nAs ruler of an independent kingdom and a key player in the recent war, Victor Amadeus significantly expanded his foreign relations. As a duke, he had envoys and embassies in France, the Empire, and Rome. In 1717, he established his own foreign office.\nKing of Sardinia.\nVictor Amadeus in 1720 was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important kingdom of Sardinia after objections from an alliance of four nations, including several of his former allies. The duke was a marquis, prince and perpetual vicar in the Holy Roman Empire.\nAbdication and later years.\nHaving done much to improve the state of his inheritance in 1684, Victor Amadeus decided to abdicate in September 1730. The lonely king had lost most of his family, including his favourite and eldest son the Prince of Piedmont, and sought the security of a previous mistress Anna Canalis di Cumiana. The couple were married in a private ceremony on 12 August 1730 in the Royal Chapel in Turin having obtained permission from Pope Clement XII. Still attractive in her forties, Victor Amadeus had long been in love with her and as a wedding gift, created her the Marchioness of Spigno. The couple made their marriage public on 3 September 1730 much to the dismay of the court. A month later, Victor Amadeus announced his wish to abdicate the throne and did so in a ceremony at the Castle of Rivoli on the day of his marriage. His son succeeded him as Charles Emmanuel III.\nTaking the style of \"King Victor Amadeus\", he and Anna moved into the ch\u00e2teau de Chamb\u00e9ry outside the capital. The couple took a small retinue of servants and Victor Amadeus was kept informed of matters of state. He insisted on having a Louis XIV-style wig with him at all times as his only luxury.\nUnder the influence of Anna, in 1731 having suffered a stroke, Victor Amadeus decided he wanted to resume his tenure on the throne and informed his son of his decision. Arrested by his son, he was transported to the Castle of Moncalieri and Anna was taken to a house for reformed prostitutes at the Castle of Ceva but was later allowed to return to the Castle of Rivoli where her husband was moved. She was returned to him on 12 April. The stroke seemed to have affected Victor Amadeus in a way which caused him to later turn violent towards his wife, blaming her for his misfortunes.\nKing Victor Amadeus died on 31 October 1732 and was buried in the Convent of San Giuseppe di Carignano. His son decided not to bury him in the Basilica of Superga which Victor Amadeus had built and where he asked to be buried, as his son did not want to remind the public of the scandal which his abdication had caused. Anna was moved to the Convent of the Visitation in Pinerolo where she died aged 88.\nCultural legacy.\nDespite his political reforms and his passion for trying to increase the importance of Savoy in Europe, Victor Amadeus left a considerable cultural legacy in the city of his birth. In 1697 Victor Amadeus commissioned Le Notre to lay out large gardens at the Palace of Turin where he had previously commissioned the Viennese Daniel Seiter to paint a famous gallery which exists to this day. Victor Amadeus subsequently had Seiter knighted. He also encouraged musical patronage in Savoy and the court became a centre for various musicians of the period.\nBeing crowned King of Sicily in Palermo on 24 December 1713, he returned to Turin in September 1714. From Palermo he brought back Filippo Juvarra, an Italian architect who had spent many years in Rome. Juvarra was patronised by Victor Amadeus and was the mind behind the remodelling of the Royal Palace of Turin, Palace of Venaria, Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi as well as building the Basilica of Superga. The architect was also responsible for various roads and piazzas in Turin. Victor Amadeus' mother also used Juvarra for the famous staircase within the Palazzo Madama where she lived after being banished.\nIn 1997 the UNESCO added a group of buildings which were connected to Victor Amadeus and his family to be added to have World Heritage status. These buildings including the Royal Palace, the Palazzo Madama, the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi and his wife's Villa della Regina were grouped as the Residences of the Royal House of Savoy.\nFamily and issue.\nHis distant relationship with his mother was always strained and has been blamed on her ambition to keep power to herself. Marie Jeanne spent most of her time relegated to state business which she enjoyed and had little time for her only child whom she kept under close supervision in order to make sure he would not try to assume power. Anne Marie gave her husband six children but also had two stillbirths of each gender, one in 1691 and again in 1697. Three of these children would go on to have further progeny, including the eldest Maria Adelaide, who was the mother of Louis XV of France. His second daughter Maria Luisa, known in the family as \"Louison\", would marry Philip V of Spain in 1701 and was also regent of Spain for various periods. These two marriages were tactics used by Louis XIV to keep Victor Amadeus close to France prior to the War of the Spanish Succession.\nAnne Marie would remain a devoted wife. She quietly accepted his extramarital affairs; the longest one being with the famed beauty Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes by whom he had two children. Jeanne Baptiste was his mistress for eleven years and eventually fled Savoy due to Victor Amadeus' obsession with her. Victor Amadeus subsequently had his daughter with Jeanne Baptiste, Maria Vittoria, marry the Prince of Carignano from which the present Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples is a direct descendant. His favourite child was Victor Amadeus born in 1699 and given the title Prince of Piedmont as heir apparent. The Prince of Piedmont later died in 1715 from smallpox. Anne Marie died in 1728 after a series of heart attacks.\nHis relationship with his younger son and eventual successor Charles Emmanuel was a cold one and the two were never close. Victor Amadeus organised the first two marriages of Charles Emmanuel, the first one being to Anne Christine of Sulzbach, daughter of the Count Palatine of Sulzbach, which produced a son who died in infancy. The second marriage was to Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, a first cousin of Anne Christine and mother of six children, including the future Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia.\nAppearances in media.\nVictor Amadeus II is a main character of the 1990 film, The King's Whore - he's played by Timothy Dalton. The movie focuses a lot on his obsessive relationship with Jeanne de Luynes, portrayed by Valeria Golino.\nReferences and notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the paternal grandfather of the last three mainline kings of Sardinia. In the War of the Polish Succession, he initially gained Lombardy but later ceded it for smaller territorial gains. During the War of the Austrian Succession, he defended Piedmont against a Franco-Spanish army, winning the Battle of Assietta. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle restored lost lands and expanded his territory. He strengthened ties with Spain through marriage alliances. He chose not to get involved in the Seven Years War and instead focused on administrative reforms and maintaining a well-disciplined army.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCharles Emmanuel was born in Turin to Victor Amadeus II of Savoy and his first wife the French Anne Marie d'Orl\u00e9ans. His maternal grandparents were Prince Philippe of France and his first wife Princess Henrietta, the youngest daughter of Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France. Charles Emmanuel was the oldest surviving brother of Princess Maria Adelaide of Savoy \u2013 the mother of Louis XV of France; he was also the brother of Maria Luisa of Savoy, Queen of Spain as wife Philip V of Spain.\nAt the time of his birth, when he was known as Duke of Aosta, Charles Emmanuel was not the heir to Savoy; his older brother Victor Amadeus, Prince of Piedmont, was the heir apparent. Charles Emmanuel was the second of three sons that would be born to his parents. His older brother died in 1715 and Charles Emmanuel then became heir apparent.\nAs a result of his aid in the War of the Spanish Succession, Victor Amadeus II was made king of Sicily in 1713 under the Treaty of Utrecht which ended the war. Victor Amadeus was forced to exchange Sicily for the less important Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720 after objections from an alliance of four nations, including some of his former allies.\nOn 3 September 1730, Victor Amadeus who, in his later years had exhibited reticence and melancholy, abdicated the throne and retired from the royal court. His son became King Charles Emanuel III. He had not been a favorite of his father's, who had neglected his education except on the military field, where the son had sometimes accompanied the father.\nAfter some time spent at his residence in Chamb\u00e9ry, however, the former king started to intervene in his son's government. Victor Amadeus reclaimed the throne, accusing his son of incompetence. He established himself in Moncalieri, but Charles Emmanuel managed to have the former king arrested by the Crown Council, in order to prevent him from attacking Milan and probably causing an invasion of Piedmont. Victor Amadeus was then confined to the Castle of Rivoli, where he later died without further interference with his son's regime.\nThe War of Polish Succession.\nIn the War of the Polish Succession Charles Emmanuel sided with the French-backed king Stanislaw I. After the treaty of alliance signed in Turin, on 28 October 1733, he marched on Milan and occupied Lombardy without significant losses. However, when France tried to convince Philip V of Spain to join the coalition, he asked to receive Milan and Mantua in exchange. This was not acceptable for Charles Emmanuel, as it would recreate a Spanish domination in Italy as it had been in the previous centuries. While negotiations continued about the matter, the Savoy-French-Spanish troops attacked Mantua under the supreme command of Charles Emmanuel himself.\nSure that in the end Mantua would be assigned to Spain, he voluntarily thwarted the expedition. The Franco-Piedmontese army was victorious in two battles at Crocetta and Guastalla. In the end, when Austria and France signed a peace, Charles was forced to leave Lombardy. In exchange, he was given some territories, including Langhe, Tortona and Novara.\nWar of the Austrian Succession.\nCharles Emmanuel sided with Maria Theresa of Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession, receiving financial and naval support from Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. After noteworthy but inconclusive initial successes, he had to face the French-Spanish invasion of Savoy and, after a failed allied attempt to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, the County of Nice. When the enemy army invaded Piedmont, in 1744 he defended Cuneo against the Spanish-French besiegers. The following year, with some 20,000 men, he was faced with an invasion of two armies with a total of some 60,000 troops. The important strongholds of Alessandria, Asti and Casale fell. In 1746, after receiving reinforcements from Austria, he was able to recapture Alessandria and Asti. In 1747, he obtained a crushing victory over the French at the Battle of Assietta, and his territories were saved when the main battleground moved northwards to the Netherlands.\nThe outcome was the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which revealed his qualities as a negotiator, in as much as he both regained the lost provinces of Nice and Savoy, and obtained Vigevano as well as other lands in the Pianura Padana. Ties with Spain were re-established with the marriage of his son Prince Victor Amadeus to the Infanta Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain in 1750.\nHe declined to participate in the Seven Years' War (1756\u201363), preferring to concentrate on administrative reforms, maintaining a well-disciplined army and strengthening his fortresses. In an attempt to improve the poor condition of the newly acquired Sardinia, he also restored the Universities of Sassari and Cagliari.\nCharles Emmanuel died in Turin in 1773. He was buried in the Basilica of Superga.\nArt collector.\nCharles Emmanuel's ancestors were avid art collectors. He added many new paintings to the collection he inherited from his ancestors. He also received paintings from the collection of Prince Eugene of Savoy who had remained childless. The collection contained many works of Flemish and Dutch painters. As a result, the Sabauda Gallery in Turin was the largest collection in Italy of 16th and 17th-century Flemish and Dutch paintings. In 1731 he established a tapestry workshop in Turin. The Flemish battle painter Jan Peeter Verdussen was his court painter and painted many of his military victories.\nMarriages and issue.\nCharles Emmanuel married three times, but all of his three wives died young. There were plans for him to marry his cousin Charlotte Agla\u00e9 d'Orl\u00e9ans, but his mother declined the offer. Amalia d'Este, daughter of Rinaldo, Duke of Modena, and Infanta Francisca Josefa of Portugal, daughter of Pedro II of Portugal, were also candidates.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is referred to as Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder as the surrounding urban area includes the historic townsite of Boulder and the local government area is the City of Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder lies on the traditional lands of the Wangkatja group of peoples. The name \"Kalgoorlie\" is derived from the Wangai word \"Karlkurla\" or \"Kulgooluh\", meaning \"place of the silky pears\". The city was established in 1893 during the Western Australian gold rushes. It soon replaced Coolgardie as the largest settlement on the Eastern Goldfields. Kalgoorlie is the ultimate destination of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme and the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail. The nearby Super Pit gold mine was Australia's largest open-cut gold mine for many years.\nDuring August 2021, Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder had an estimated urban population of 29,072, a slight decline from the recent peak of 32,966 in 2013.\nHistory.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder lies on the traditional lands of the Wangkatja people. Languages including Wangkatja, part of the Wati language family, continue to be spoken there today.\nIn the winter of 1893, prospectors Patrick (Paddy) Hannan, Tom Flanagan, and Dan Shea were travelling to Mount Youle, when one of their horses cast a shoe. During the halt in their journey, the men noticed signs of gold in the area around the foot of what is now the Mount Charlotte gold mine, located on a small hill north of the current city, and decided to stay and investigate. On 17 June 1893, Hannan filed a Reward Claim, leading to hundreds of men swarming to the area in search of gold, and Kalgoorlie, originally called Hannan's Find, was born.\nDuring the ensuing gold rush, significant deposits of calaverite were discovered, but ignored as it was believed at the time that this was a mineral akin to fool's gold. The calaverite was subsequently used for construction in the town, including for buildings and paving. When it was realised in 1896 that calaverite is a compound of tellurium with actual gold, there was a rush to demolish any such structures in order to extract the gold therein. Nearly every structure created in the previous three years was scrapped in the process.\nThe population of the town was 2,018 (1,516 males and 502 females) in 1898.\nThe mining of gold, along with other metals such as nickel, has been a major industry in Kalgoorlie ever since, and today employs about one-quarter of Kalgoorlie's workforce and generates a significant proportion of its income. The concentrated area of large gold mines surrounding the original Hannan's find is often referred to as the Golden Mile, and was sometimes referred to as the world's richest square mile of earth.In 1901, the population of Kalgoorlie was 4,793 (3,087 males and 1,706 females) which increased to 6,790 (3,904 males and 2,886 females) by 1903.\nThe narrow-gauge Government Eastern Goldfields Railway line reached Kalgoorlie station in 1896, and the main named railway service from Perth was the overnight sleeper train \"The Westland\", which ran until the 1970s. In 1917, a railway line was completed, connecting Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta, South Australia, across of desert, and consequently the rest of the eastern states. The standardisation of the railway connecting Perth (which changed route from the narrow-gauge route) in 1968 completed the Sydney\u2013Perth railway, making rail travel from Perth to Sydney possible; the \"Indian Pacific\" rail service commenced soon after. During the 1890s, the Goldfields area boomed as a whole, with an area population exceeding 200,000, composed mainly of prospectors. The area gained a reputation for being a \"wild west\", notorious for its bandits and prostitutes. This rapid increase in population and claims of neglect by the state government in Perth led to the proposition of the new state of Auralia, but with the sudden diaspora after the Gold Rush, these plans fell through.\nPlaces, famous or infamous, for which Kalgoorlie is noted include its water pipeline, designed by C. Y. O'Connor and bringing in fresh water from Mundaring Weir near Perth, its Hay Street brothels, its two-up school, the goldfields railway loopline, the Kalgoorlie Town Hall, the Paddy Hannan statue/drinking fountain, the Super Pit, and Mount Charlotte lookout. Its main street is Hannan Street, named after the town's founder. One of the infamous brothels also serves as a museum and is a major national attraction.\nKalgoorlie and the surrounding district were served by an extensive collection of suburban railways and tramways, providing for both passenger and freight traffic.\nIn 1989, the Town of Kalgoorlie and Shire of Boulder formally amalgamated to create the City of Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder, adjoining the two towns into what is now the fifth most populous city in Western Australia.\nOn 20 April 2010, Kalgoorlie was shaken by an earthquake that reached 5.0 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was 30\u00a0km north east of the town. The quake caused damage to a number of commercial hotels and historic buildings along Burt Street in Boulder. The entire Burt St. precinct was evacuated until 23 April. Work in the Superpit and many other mines around Kalgoorlie was stopped. Two people suffered minor injuries as a result of the quake.\nPopulation.\nAccording to the 2021 census, there were 29,072 people in the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder Significant Urban Area:\nGeography.\nClimate.\nKalgoorlie has a hot semi-arid climate (\"BSh\") bordering both a hot desert climate (\"BWh\") and a cool semi-arid climate (\"BSk\") with hot summers and mild winters. The average annual rainfall is on an average of 68 days and, while the average rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, there is considerable variation from year to year.\nJanuary is the hottest month, with an average maximum temperature of , but temperatures above occur nearly once a week when hot, dry, north to northeasterly winds arrive. Such high temperatures are usually followed by a cool change from the south, and occasionally with a thunderstorm.\nBy contrast, winters are cool, with July average maximum and minimum temperatures being and , respectively. Cold, wet days with a maximum below occur about once every winter. The lowest maximum temperature recorded is , on 19 July 1961. Overnight temperatures fall below freezing about four times in a typical winter. Such events occur on clear nights following a day of cold southerly winds.\nIndustry and commerce.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder is a regional centre and has a Chamber of Commerce and a Chamber of Minerals and Energy.\nMining.\nSince 1992, Kalgoorlie has been home to the Diggers &amp; Dealers conference, held annually in August. It is Australia's premier international mining conference.\nThe Fimiston Open Pit (Super Pit) is an open-cut gold mine about long, wide, and over deep. Originally consisting of a large number of underground mines, including the Paringa, Oroya, Brown Hill, Chaffers, and Hainault mines, they were consolidated into a single open pit mine in 1989. A visitor centre overlooks the mine, which operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The mine blasts at 1:00\u00a0pm every day, unless winds would carry dust over the town. Each of the massive trucks carries 225 tonnes of rock and the round trip takes about 35 minutes, most of that time being the slow uphill haul. Employees must live in Kalgoorlie; there's no fly-in, fly-out operation. The current life of mine plan covers operation until 2035, with investigations for mine extension ongoing.\nSex work.\nKalgoorlie once had a thriving sex industry, with parts of Hay Street once being considered Kalgoorlie's red-light district. Originally, brothels were only allowed to operate in Hay Street. While there were once a number of brothels in Kalgoorlie, this has since decreased.\nProstitutes from all over the world moved to Kalgoorlie for employment in the town's sex work industry.\nToday, only one brothel remains in Kalgoorlie: Questa Casa (Italian for \"This House\"; locally known as the \"Pink House\"). Questa Casa claims to be Australia's oldest operating brothel, having begun operations in 1904. Questa Casa now only employs two sex workers, but also serves as an adult tourist attraction.\nThe demise of the red light district has largely been attributed to the rescinding of the \"Containment Policy\" in 1994. The \"Containment Policy\" was an informal policy that restricted all sex work in Kalgoorlie to one street: Hay Street. Nevertheless, \"skimpy barmaids\" (female bartenders who wear sexually provocative clothing, usually flying into Kalgoorlie from elsewhere) are known to occasionally sell sex.\nCulture.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder has a dynamic and diverse cultural scene.\nArts.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder has many arts organisations and practising artists.\nSports.\nKalgoorlie\u2013Boulder's location, being roughly 600\u00a0km from Perth, enjoys high levels of participation in Australian rules football (the Goldfields Football League), netball, basketball, rugby league, soccer, field hockey, and cricket. Other popular sports in Kalgoorlie include tennis, lawn bowls, roller derby, rugby union, and swimming.\nKalgoorlie also has an international squash tournament held every year at the YMCA.\nIn a statewide sense, the semiprofessional Goldfields Giants basketball team competes in the State Basketball League, and were league champions in 2007 and 2008.\nThe Goldfields Titans play in the Western Australia Rugby League Harvey Norman Premiership state rugby league competition. Home games are at the Oasis playing fields on Saturday afternoons.\nHorse racing is also very popular in the city, and Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder is home to the internationally recognised annual \"Race Round\".\nEvery year the annual Kalgoorlie Desert Race is held. It is a gruelling off-road race.\nAttractions.\nGiven the wealth of its yesteryear, Kalgoorlie features many elaborate heritage buildings that have been retained. Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder \u2013 the largest settlement for many hundreds of kilometres, with many employees at the Super Pit \u2013 is the centre of the area's social life. Of particular interest is the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder Racecourse, a horse racing venue. Two grass sports ovals and a cinema showing recent international releases are in the area.\nWell known in the area are the Kalgoorlie,&lt;ref name=\"griffithreview/kalgoorlie\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Geraldton,&lt;ref name=\"geraldtonguardian/skimpy\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perth,&lt;ref name=\"independent/skimpy-cover\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and Albany&lt;ref name=\"albanyadvertiser/skimpies\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; skimpy barmaids,&lt;ref name=\"thewest/kalgoorlie-too-skimpy\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; mostly flown in,&lt;ref name=\"smh/skimpy-debate\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; employed by pubs like Exchange Hotel,&lt;ref name=\"watoday/overpriced-kalgoorlie\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who walk around \"scantily clad\"&lt;ref name=\"nzherald/skimpies-return\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in bikini, lingerie&lt;ref name=\"theguardian/skimpies-nights\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or burlesque outfits to attract punters and who expect a fee&lt;ref name=\"time/Treasure\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; in return.\nHistoric hotels.\nKalgoorlie has historical hotels still in operation:\nMany hotels have been put to private use, including:\nHotels that have disappeared from the city include:\nSuburbs.\nThe Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder metropolitan area consists of the following suburbs:\nKnown as the home of the Super Pit, it is one of Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder's historical suburbs featuring many buildings and landmarks dating as far back as 1882. It was once the central business district for the Town of Boulder, but since amalgamation with Kalgoorlie, it is now more of a historical local centre. Boulder has its own post office, town hall and many hotels along its main thoroughfare, Burt Street. A significant refurbishment has been commenced as part of the 'Royalties for Regions' initiative.\nA new housing suburb located next to the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder Airport, which was recently expanded.\nThis area derives its name from the golf course that once occupied the area. It was released to provide affordable property to a growing population in Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder. Fairways features a private primary school, church, caravan park and small business.\nAdeline was originally constructed around 1970 by the State Housing Commission. The suburb was built on the \"Radburn concept\", with houses facing away from the street and common pathways linking homes. The area has been plagued by antisocial problems. In 2003, a significant urban renewal project was commenced, including the renaming of the suburb to \"Golden Grove\" and re-aligning of homes. The project has seen some success but has yet to fully eliminate antisocial problems within the area.\nSee Broadwood.\nLocated in Kalgoorlie's far north. Hannans was the first suburb to have its own independent shopping centre (\"Hannans Boulevard\") which includes a IGA SuperMarket (formally Coles supermarket). The area also has a primary school and an 18-hole golf course. The original course was not formally grassed but was recently refurbished. Several surrounding golf clubs joined together to form one club known as 'The Goldfields Golf Club'. A dam has been constructed to service what is now a luxury desert golf course and club. Alongside the golf course project has been the development and release of Greenview estate. It lies on the western border of Hannans. This ongoing project has been designed as an environmentally friendly estate, and will eventually consist of over 2000 homes, apartments and facilities such as parks and schools. As one of Kalgoorlie's highest growth areas there has been a proposal for a new alternative route, out of the suburb onto the Kalgoorlie Bypass, to avoid traffic problems on the already heavily used Graeme Street which is a direct route to the city centre. Other developments include 'Karkurla Rise' and 'Karkurla View' which have added an additional 400 homes to the area.\nThe central business district. Hannan Street, named after Paddy Hannan, is Kalgoorlie's main street and stretches the length of the suburb. The western side of the suburb consists of housing and some light industry. The eastern side contains retail chains, banks, the police station, court house, restaurants, hotels, tourist attractions, schools, university, and a TAFE.\nOne of Kalgoorlie's oldest suburbs. Much like other older suburbs, almost every street is parallel with Hannan Street in Central Kalgoorlie. Streets are noticeably wide. It houses North Kalgoorlie Primary School, small businesses, a medical practice, a hotel, tavern and a non-maintained 18-hole golf course.\nMuch smaller today than it originally was before the Super Pit expansion, Mullingar is located at the far east end of Lamington, between the northern Goldfields railway and Goldfields Highway.\nOfficially O'Connor is the south-east section of the suburb of Somerville. Much of the area is increasingly now known as O'Connor. It is home to a primary school (O'Connor Primary School), a private high school (Goldfields Baptist College), and shopping facilities. It also houses the city's only recreation centre.\nA narrow suburb following Piccadilly street between Central Kalgoorlie and Lamington. It features the city's regional hospital, small businesses, a hotel, sporting arena and two grassed ovals.\nSomerville marks the end of Great Eastern Highway that stretches between Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder and Perth. Much of the area is now referred to locally as O'Connor. Somerville contains a residential area, schools, retail shops, light industry and some horse stables. In the past it also contained market gardens.\nStretching from Boundary Street, Kalgoorlie to Holmes Street, Golden Grove and bordering with Central Kalgoorlie, O'Connor and Golden Grove, South Kalgoorlie is mostly residential but also contains the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder Racecourse, schools, some light industrial and small businesses. The suburb was expanded in the mid-1990s to include a sub-division named \"Sport of Kings\" on Maxwell Street, using a surplus of land from the racecourse.\nA residential-only subdivision within Fairways estate along Burt Street.\nKalgoorlie's main industrial area, it is the first suburb as you approach Kalgoorlie on the Great Eastern Highway. It features the city's airport, as well as small, medium, and heavy industrial areas. Currently under expansion further west (ANZAC Drive Industrial Estate).\nThe western tip of Lamington was built in the 1980s. It includes one shop, sporting facilities and an arboretum nature reserve.\nThis small existing area features mostly housing with one small primary school. It is also home to the Mount Charlotte gold mine (past production of about 5,000,000 ounces of gold), the Cassidy Shaft and Nanny Goat Hill (Mt Gleddon). Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines, owner of the Super Pit to the south on the Golden Mile, from 2015 mined the \"Hidden Secret\" orebody, between and below the surface of Williamstown, using Mount Charlotte's Cassidy Shaft as access.\nTransport.\nRail.\nThe town is located on the main East-West rail corridor across Australia. The \"Transwa Prospector\" operates once to twice daily passenger train services from Kalgoorlie to Perth. The \"Indian Pacific\" train also stops here, operating weekly in each direction.\nBuses.\nTown bus services are provided by TransGoldfields, there are three town routes as well as school services. Transwa also operates road coaches that service the town.\nAir.\nCommercial air services connect Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder with Melbourne and Perth, operating out of the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder Airport. Airlines that provide regular flights include Alliance Airlines, Qantas, QantasLink and Virgin Australia. There is a locally owned and operated charter company with a flight school, Goldfields Air Services.\nRoad.\nKalgoorlie is linked to Perth by the Great Eastern Highway, and is also on the Goldfields Highway.\nMedia.\nRadio\nRadio Services available in Kalgoorlie:\nTelevision\nTelevision services available include:\nThe programming schedule is mainly the same as the Seven, Nine and Ten stations in Perth with variations for news bulletins, sport telecasts such as the Australian Football League and National Rugby League, children's and lifestyle programs and infomercials or \"paid programming\".\nSeven maintains a newsroom in the city. The Seven bureau provides coverage of the surrounding area for the station's nightly 30-minute local news program, \"Seven News\", at 5:30pm on weeknights.\nA Foxtel subscription television service is available via satellite.\nNewspapers\nThe local newspaper for the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder and Goldfields region is \"The Kalgoorlie Miner\".\nNewspapers from Perth, including \"The West Australian\" and \"The Sunday Times\", are also available, as well as national newspapers such as \"The Australian\" and the \"Australian Financial Review\".\nEducation.\nThere are 10 primary schools, four high schools and one university in the Kalgoorlie\u2013Boulder area.\nNotable people.\nNotable people from or who have lived in Kalgoorlie include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; travel guide from Wikivoyage"}

Although he was politically conservative, he carried out numerous administrative reforms until he declared war on Revolutionary France in 1792. He was the father of the last three mainline kings of Sardinia.\nEarly life and personality.\nBorn at the Royal Palace of Turin, he was a son of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and his second wife, Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg. He was styled the \"Duke of Savoy\" from birth until he succeeded to his father's throne. He was the eldest son of his parents and was the heir apparent from birth which was greeted with much celebration. His father had had a son with his first wife, Countess Palatine Anne Christine of Sulzbach, who was also named Victor Amadeus, Duke of Aosta, but died in 1725. His education was entrusted to Gerdil Giacinto Sigismondo, with a particular emphasis on military training. Throughout his life, he had a great interest in the state military, on which he lavished attention.\nAs a young prince, he surrounded himself with intellectuals and ministers, many of whom would come to prominence in his reign. He was privately conservative and a very religious person, and, as a young boy, stayed far from public life. His father felt him to be unsuitable to hold power.\nGood-natured but naive, Savoy was loved by his subjects for his generosity.\nMarriage.\nHe married Infanta Maria Antonia of Spain (1729\u20131785), youngest daughter of Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese. They were married on 31 May 1750 at Oulx and later had twelve children. He had a loving relationship with his wife, who exerted little influence over her husband. The marriage had been arranged by Maria Antonietta's half-brother, the ruling Ferdinand VI. The Spanish Infanta had been previously rejected by Louis, Dauphin of France. The union was used to strengthen relations between Madrid and Turin having fought on opposing sides in the War of the Austrian Succession. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war.\nKing of Sardinia.\nWhen Victor Amadeus came to the throne in 1773 he started working on bureaucratic and military aspects of the reign. He was suspicious of anything innovative. However, he did implement several public works as well as paying a great deal of attention to his administration and armed forces. He approved and set up two new important cultural state institutions on the advice of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy alike. He started works of improvements in the port of Nice, and had dams in the Arce and the road of the C\u00f4te built.At the outbreak of the French Revolution, Victor Amadeus III allowed his two sons-in-law, the Counts of Artois and Provence and the Princesses Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Victoire to stay in his kingdom under his protection. After four years of fighting, the French under Bonaparte had finally beaten the Piedmontese army in the Battle of Montenotte (12 April 1796), the Battle of Millesimo (13\u201314 April 1796) and the Battle of Mondovi (21 April 1796). On 26 April the French proclaimed the Republic of Alba in the occupied territories. Two days later, with the Armistice of Cherasco, the republic was ceded back to Victor Amadeus. \nHe was forced to sign the Treaty of Paris on 15 May, abandoning the First Coalition against the French Republic. The terms of the treaty required him to cede the fortresses of Cuneo, Ceva, Alessandria and Tortona to France, and allow free passage of the latter's armies towards Italy. He was also compelled to cede Nice and Savoy. \nHe died on 16 October 1796 at the Castle of Moncalieri having suffered an attack of apoplexy. Victor Amadeus died leaving an economically damaged kingdom and two key provinces \u2013 Savoy and Nice \u2013 devastated, having suffered at the hands of French revolutionary forces. He was buried at the Basilica of Superga in Turin.\nLegacy.\nIn 1786 Victor Amadeus III moved the remains of many of his ancestors and kinsmen to the Basilica of Superga, where he himself rests today. He established the Gold Medal of Military Valour on 21 May 1793. Like his parents, he carried out improvements to the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi outside Turin. Victor Amadeus III also encouraged the extension of the Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Torino as well as the Societ\u00e0 Agraria di Torino, which he created in 1785. His first cousin the Landgrave of Hesse-Rotenburg was named after him.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Sister-inline/styles.css\"/&gt; Media related to at Wikimedia Commons"}

{"id": "69562", "revid": "25492241", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69562", "title": "Vasectomy", "text": "Surgical procedure for male sterilization\nVasectomy is an elective surgical procedure that results in male sterilization, often as a means of permanent contraception. During the procedure, the vasa deferentia are cut and tied or sealed so as to prevent sperm from entering into the urethra and thereby prevent fertilization of ova through sexual intercourse. Vasectomies are usually performed in a physician's office, medical clinic, or, when performed on a non-human animal, in a veterinary clinic. Hospitalization is not normally required as the procedure is not complicated, the incisions are small, and the necessary equipment routine.\nThere are several methods by which a surgeon might complete a vasectomy procedure, all of which occlude (i.e., \"seal\") at least one side of each vas deferens. To help reduce anxiety and increase patient comfort, those who have an aversion to needles may consider a \"no-needle\" application of anesthesia while the 'no-scalpel' or 'open-ended' techniques help to accelerate recovery times and increase the chance of healthy recovery.\nDue to the simplicity of the surgery, a vasectomy usually takes less than 30 minutes to complete. After a short recovery at the doctor's office (usually less than an hour), the patient is sent home to rest. Because the procedure is minimally invasive, many vasectomy patients find that they can resume their typical sexual behavior within a week, and do so with little or no discomfort.\nBecause the procedure is considered a permanent method of contraception and is not easily reversed, patients are frequently counseled and advised to consider how the long-term outcome of a vasectomy might affect them both emotionally and physically.\nA vasectomy without the patient's consent or knowledge is considered forced sterilization.\nMedical uses.\nA vasectomy is done to prevent fertility in males. It ensures that in most cases the person will be sterile after confirmation of success following surgery. The procedure is regarded as permanent because vasectomy reversal is costly and often does not restore the male's sperm count or sperm motility to prevasectomy levels. Those with vasectomies have a very small (nearly zero) chance of successfully impregnating someone, but a vasectomy does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nAfter vasectomy, the testes remain in the scrotum where Leydig cells continue to produce testosterone and other male hormones that continue to be secreted into the bloodstream.\nWhen the vasectomy is complete, sperm cannot exit the body through the penis. Sperm is still produced by the testicles but is broken down and absorbed by the body. Much fluid content is absorbed by membranes in the epididymis, and much solid content is broken down by the responding macrophages and reabsorbed via the bloodstream. After vasectomy, the membranes must increase in size to absorb and store more fluid; this triggering of the immune system causes more macrophages to be recruited to break down and reabsorb more solid content. Within one year after vasectomy, sixty to seventy percent of those vasectomized develop antisperm antibodies. In some cases, vasitis nodosa, a benign proliferation of the ductular epithelium, can also result. The accumulation of sperm increases pressure in the vas deferens and epididymis. The entry of the sperm into the scrotum can cause sperm granulomas to be formed by the body to contain and absorb the sperm which the body will treat as a foreign biological substance (much like a virus or bacterium).\nEfficacy.\nVasectomy is the most effective permanent form of contraception available to males. (Removing the entire vas deferens would very likely be more effective, but it is not something that is regularly done.) In nearly every way that vasectomy can be compared to tubal ligation it has a more positive outlook. Vasectomy is more cost effective, less invasive, has techniques that are emerging that may facilitate easier reversal, and has a much lower risk of postoperative complications.\nEarly failure rates, i.e. pregnancy within a few months after vasectomy, typically result from unprotected sexual intercourse too soon after the procedure while some sperm continue to pass through the vasa deferentia. Most physicians and surgeons who perform vasectomies recommend one (sometimes two) postprocedural semen specimens to verify a successful vasectomy; however, many people fail to return for verification tests citing inconvenience, embarrassment, forgetfulness, or certainty of sterility. In January 2008, the FDA cleared a home test called SpermCheck Vasectomy that allows patients to perform postvasectomy confirmation tests themselves; however, compliance for postvasectomy semen analysis in general remains low.\nLate failure, i.e. pregnancy following spontaneous recanalization of the vasa deferentia, has also been documented. This occurs because the epithelium of the vas deferens (similar to the epithelium of some other human body parts) is capable of regenerating and creating a new tube if the vas deferens is damaged and/or severed. Even when as much as five centimeters (or two inches) of the vas deferens is removed, the vas deferens can still grow back together and become reattached\u2014thus allowing sperm to once again pass and flow through the vas deferens, restoring one's fertility.\nThe Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists states there is a generally agreed-upon rate of late failure of about one in 2000 vasectomies\u2014better than tubal ligations for which the failure rate is one in every 200 to 300 cases. A 2005 review including both early and late failures described a total of 183 recanalizations from 43,642 vasectomies (0.4%), and 60 pregnancies after 92,184 vasectomies (0.07%).\nComplications and concerns.\nShort-term possible complications include infection, bruising and bleeding into the scrotum resulting in a collection of blood known as a hematoma. A 2012 study demonstrated an infection rate of 2.5% postvasectomy. The stitches on the small incisions required are prone to irritation, though this can be minimized by covering them with gauze or small adhesive bandages. The primary long-term complications are chronic pain conditions or syndromes that can affect any of the scrotal, pelvic or lower-abdominal regions, collectively known as post-vasectomy pain syndrome. \nComplications not withstanding, many men express concerns regarding potential adverse effects of vasectomy. The risk of testicular cancer is not affected by vasectomy. In 2014, the American Urological Association reaffirmed that vasectomy is not a risk factor for prostate cancer and that it is not necessary for physicians to routinely discuss prostate cancer in their preoperative counseling of men undergoing vasectomy. A 2017 meta-analysis found no statistically significant increase in risk of prostate cancer. A 2019 study of 2.1 million Danish males found that vasectomy increased their incidence of prostate cancer by 15%. A 2020 meta-analysis found that vasectomy increased the incidence by 9%. Other studies agree on the 15% increase in risk of developing prostate cancer, but found that people who get a vasectomy are not more likely to die from prostate cancer than those without a vasectomy. \nPostvasectomy pain.\nPost-vasectomy pain syndrome is a chronic and sometimes debilitating condition that may develop immediately or several years after vasectomy. The most robust study of post-vasectomy pain, according to the American Urology Association's Vasectomy Guidelines of 2012 (amended 2015) surveyed people just before their vasectomy and again seven months later. Of those that responded and who said they did not have any scrotal pain prior to vasectomy, 7% had scrotal pain seven months later which they described as \"Mild, a bit of a nuisance\", 1.6% had pain that was \"Moderate, require painkillers\" and 0.9% had pain that was \"quite severe and noticeably affecting their quality of life\". Post-vasectomy pain can be constant orchialgia or epididymal pain (epididymitis), or it can be pain that occurs only at particular times such as with sexual intercourse, ejaculation, or physical exertion.\nPsychological effects.\nA 1990 study indicated that some 90% of men are generally reported in reviews as being satisfied with having had a vasectomy, while 7\u201310% of people regret their decision.\nYounger people who receive a vasectomy are significantly more likely to regret and seek a reversal of their vasectomy, with one study showing people in their twenties being 12.5 times more likely to undergo a vasectomy reversal later in life (and including some who chose sterilization at a young age). Pre-vasectomy counseling is often emphasised for younger patients.\nProcedure.\nThe traditional incision approach of vasectomy involves numbing of the scrotum with local anesthetic (although some people's physiology may make access to the vas deferens more difficult in which case general anesthesia may be recommended) after which a scalpel is used to make two small incisions, one on each side of the scrotum at a location that allows the surgeon to bring each vas deferens to the surface for excision. The vasa deferentia are cut (sometimes a section may be removed altogether), separated, and then at least one side is sealed by ligating (suturing), cauterizing (electrocauterization), or clamping. There are several variations to this method that may improve healing, effectiveness, and which help mitigate long-term pain such as post-vasectomy pain syndrome or epididymitis, however the data supporting one over another are limited.\nOther techniques.\nThe following vasectomy methods have purportedly had a better chance of later reversal but have seen less use by virtue of known higher failure rates (i.e., recanalization). An earlier clip device, the VasClip, is no longer on the market, due to unacceptably high failure rates.\nThe VasClip method, though considered reversible, has had a higher cost and resulted in lower success rates. Also, because the vasa deferentia are not cut or tied with this method, it could technically be classified as other than a vasectomy. Vasectomy reversal (and the success thereof) was conjectured to be higher as it only required removing the Vas-Clip device. This method achieved limited use, and scant reversal data are available.\nVas occlusion techniques.\nBoth vas occlusion techniques require the same basic patient setup: local anesthesia, puncturing of the scrotal sac for access of the vas, and then plug or injected plug occlusion. The success of the aforementioned vas occlusion techniques is not clear and data are still limited. Studies have shown, however, that the time to achieve sterility is longer than the more prominent techniques mentioned in the beginning of this article. The satisfaction rate of patients undergoing IVD techniques has a high rate of satisfaction with regard to the surgery experience itself.\nRecovery.\nSexual intercourse can usually be resumed in about a week (depending on recovery); however, pregnancy is still possible as long as the sperm count is above zero. Another method of contraception must be relied upon until a sperm count is performed either two months after the vasectomy or after 10\u201320 ejaculations have occurred.\nAfter a vasectomy, contraceptive precautions must be continued until azoospermia is confirmed. Usually two semen analyses at three and four months are necessary to confirm azoospermia. The British Andrological Society has recommended that a single semen analysis confirming azoospermia after sixteen weeks is sufficient.\nPost-vasectomy, testicles will continue to produce sperm cells. As before vasectomy, unused sperm are reabsorbed by the body.\nConceiving after vasectomy.\nIn order to allow the possibility of reproduction via artificial insemination after vasectomy, some opt for cryopreservation of sperm before sterilization. Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology at Sheffield University and secretary of the British Fertility Society, notes that those he sees for a vasectomy reversal which has not worked express wishing they had known they could have stored sperm. Pacey notes, \"The problem is you're asking a man to foresee a future where he might not necessarily be with his current partner\u2014and that may be quite hard to do when she's sitting next to you.\"\nThe cost of cryo-preservation (sperm banking) may also be substantially less than alternative vaso-vasectomy procedures, compared to the costs of in-vitro fertilization (IVF) which usually run from $12,000 to $25,000.\nSperm can be aspirated from the testicles or the epididymides, and while there is not enough for successful artificial insemination, there is enough to fertilize an ovum by intracytoplasmic sperm injection. This avoids the problem of antisperm antibodies and may result in a faster pregnancy. IVF may be less costly per cycle than reversal in some health-care systems, but a single IVF cycle is often insufficient for conception. Disadvantages include the need for procedures on the woman, and the standard potential side-effects of IVF for both the mother and the child.\nVasectomy reversal.\nVasectomies are not always reversible. There is a surgical procedure to reverse vasectomies using vasovasostomy (a form of microsurgery first performed by Earl Owen in 1971). Vasovasostomy is effective at achieving pregnancy in a variable percentage of cases, and total out-of-pocket costs in the United States are often upwards of $10,000. The typical success rate of pregnancy following a vasectomy reversal is around 55% if performed within 10 years, and drops to around 25% if performed after 10 years. After reversal, sperm counts and motility are usually much lower than pre-vasectomy levels.\nApproximately 2% of men who have undergone vasectomy will undergo a reversal within 10 years of the procedure. A small number of vasectomy reversals are also performed in attempts to relieve post-vasectomy pain syndrome.\nPrevalence.\nInternationally, vasectomy rates are vastly different. While female sterilisation is the most widely used method worldwide, with 223 million women relying on it, only 28 million women rely on their partner's vasectomy. In the world's 69 least developed countries less than 0.1% of males use vasectomies on average. Of 54 African countries, only ten report measurable vasectomy use and only Eswatini, Botswana, and South Africa exceed 0.1% prevalence.\nIn North America and Europe vasectomy usage is on the order of 10% with some countries reaching 20%. Despite its high efficacy, in the United States, vasectomy is utilized less than half the rate of the alternative female tubal ligation. According to the research, vasectomy in the US is least utilized among black and Latino populations, the groups that have the highest rates of female sterilization.\nNew Zealand, in contrast, has higher levels of vasectomy than tubal ligation; 18% of all males, and 25% of all married males, have had a vasectomy. The age cohort with the highest level of vasectomy was 40\u201349, where 57% of males had taken it up. Canada, the UK, Bhutan and the Netherlands all have similar levels of uptake.\nHistory.\nThe first human vasectomies were performed in the late 19th century. The procedure was initially used mainly as a treatment for prostate enlargement and as a eugenic method for sterilizing \"degenerates\". Vasectomy as a method of voluntary birth control began during the Second World War. \nThe first recorded vasectomy was performed on a dog in 1823. The first human vasectomies were performed to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia, or enlargement of the prostate. Castration had sometimes been used as a treatment for this condition in the 1880s, but, given the serious side effects, doctors sought alternative treatments. The first to suggest vasectomy as an alternative to castration may have been James Ewing Mears (in 1890), or Jean Casimir F\u00e9lix Guyon.\nThe first human vasectomy is thought to have been performed by Reginald Harrison. By 1900, Harrison reported that he had performed more than 100 vasectomies with no adverse outcomes.\nIn the late 1890s, vasectomy also came to be proposed as a eugenic measure for the sterilization of men considered unfit to reproduce. The first case report of vasectomy in the United States was in 1897, by A.\u00a0J. Ochsner, a surgeon in Chicago, in a paper titled, \"Surgical treatment of habitual criminals\". He believed vasectomy to be a simple, effective means for stemming the tide of racial degeneration widely believed to be occurring. In 1902, Harry C. Sharp, the surgeon at the Indiana Reformatory, reported that he had sterilized 42 inmates in an effort to both reduce criminal behavior in those individuals and prevent the birth of future criminals.\nEugen Steinach (1861\u20131944), an Austrian physician, believed that a unilateral vasectomy (severing only one of the two vasa deferentia) in older individuals could restore general vigor and sexual potency, shrink enlarged prostates, and cure various ailments by somehow boosting the hormonal output of the vasectomized testicle. This surgery, which became very popular in the 1920s, was undertaken by many wealthy individuals, including Sigmund Freud and W. B. Yeats. Since these operations lacked rigorous controlled trials, any rejuvenating effect was likely due to the placebo effect, and with the later development of synthetic injectable hormones, this operation fell out of vogue.\nVasectomy began to be regarded as a method of consensual birth control during the Second World War. The first vasectomy program on a national scale was launched in 1954 in India. In the 1970s, India enacted a coercive sterilization campaign which resulted in millions of vasectomies. Today, India's sterilization program focuses on coercing poor women.\nSociety and culture.\nAvailability and legality.\nVasectomy costs are (or may be) covered in different countries, as a method of both contraception or population control, with some offering it as a part of a national health insurance. The procedure was generally considered illegal in France until 2001, due to provisions in the Napoleonic Code forbidding \"self-mutilation\". No French law specifically mentioned vasectomy until a 2001 law on contraception and infanticide permitted the procedure.\nThe U.S. Affordable Care Act (signed into law in 2010) does not cover vasectomies, although eight states require state-health insurance plans to cover the cost. These include: Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington.\nIn 2014, the Iranian parliament voted for a bill that would ban the procedure.\nImpact of legal changes (US).\nAn analysis of medical records of 217 million people in the U.S. compared tubal sterilization and vasectomy rates in the last six months of 2021 with rates in the last six months of 2022\u2014just after the Dobbs ruling (i.e. the overturning of Roe vs Wade) in June 2022. Although the effect of Dobbs was different in various social groups, it had a strong impact on those under age 30 with their vasectomy rates increasing by 59%, and tubal sterilization rates increasing by 29%.\nTourism.\nMedical tourism, where a patient travels to a less-developed location where a procedure is cheaper to save money and combine convalescence with a vacation, is infrequently used for vasectomy due to its low cost, but is more likely to be used for vasectomy reversal. Many hospitals list vasectomy as being available. Medical tourism has been scrutinized by some governments for quality of care and postoperative care issues.\nShooting of Andrew Rynne.\nIn 1990, Andrew Rynne, chairperson of the Irish Family Planning Association, and the Republic of Ireland's first vasectomy specialist, was shot by a former client, but he survived. The incident is the subject of a short film, \"The Vasectomy Doctor\", by Paul Webster.\nNon-human animals.\nVasectomy is regularly performed on bulls.\nVasectomy has been proposed as an alternative to neutering for feral cats, as they maintain their position in the breeding hierarchy instead of letting intact males take over.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

From his birth to his succession to the throne of Sardinia in 1796, Charles Emmanuel was styled \"Prince of Piedmont\".\nIn 1773, Victor Amadeus III became king of Sardinia and began to organise a political marriage for his son. Two of Charles Emmanuel's sisters were married to younger brothers of king Louis XVI of France: Marie Jos\u00e9phine to the count of Provence, who was later king Louis XVIII, and Maria Theresa to the count of Artois, who was later king Charles X. On 21 August 1775, after two years of negotiations, Charles Emmanuel was engaged to Clotilde of France, a sister of Louis XVI. The wedding took place on 6 September 1775 at Chamb\u00e9ry. Although the union was arranged for political reasons, Charles Emmanuel and his wife became devoted to each other. They shared a very strict and sober Catholic faith. Their attempts to have children, however, were unsuccessful.\nCharles Emmanuel was profoundly affected by the French Revolution, which saw his brother-in-law Louis XVI and his wife Marie Antoinette executed in 1793. From 1794, troops of the First French Republic raided the Savoyard domains. Charles Emmanuel sought solace in his faith and became a member of the Third Order of Saint Dominic in 1794.\nReign.\nAt the death of his father on 16 October 1796 Charles Emmanuel succeeded as King of Sardinia. The kingdom included not only the island of Sardinia but also significant territories in northwest Italy including all of Piedmont.\nIn March 1796, Sardinia had been forced to conclude the disadvantageous Treaty of Paris (1796) with the French Republic, giving the French army free passage through Piedmont. On 4 April 1797, Charles Emmanuel decided to make a preliminary deal with France under which he would renounce control of Sardinia in exchange for an equivalent territory in Italy. The treasury of the kingdom was empty, the army was disabled and disorganised, and revolutionary feeling was strong among the populace. Between 1796 and 1798, two conspiracies against the monarchy were foiled and the conspirators condemned to death. On 6 December 1798 the French, under Joubert, occupied Turin and forced Charles Emanuel to abdicate all his territories on the Italian mainland and restrict his realm to the island of Sardinia, which stayed out of the reach of the French army. After this, Piedmont became a French military region. Charles Emmanuel and his wife left Turin for Parma and then Florence. In February 1799, security concerns forced Charles Emmanuel to retire to Sardinia. The following month, the French occupied Florence and expelled the Grand-Duke of Tuscany from his domains.\nIn Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel issued a formal protest against the confiscation of his mainland territories, announced numerous reforms for the island, and closed his ports to the English fleet. In the meanwhile, the Russian army had liberated Turin from the French. At the invitation of tsar Paul I of Russia, who had instructed General Suvorov to send count Alessandro de Rege di Gifflenga to Sardinia to restore the Sardinian throne, Charles Emmanuel decided to leave the island and return to the mainland. When he disembarked at Livorno with his wife on 22 September 1799, he discovered that the Russian army had left Piedmont in Austrian hands and that the latter were not inclined to support his restoration. He then decided to establish himself at the Villa del Poggio Imperiale near Florence, where he met with one of his subjects, Vittorio Alfieri. \nBetween 1800 and 1802, Charles Emmanuel and his wife stayed at Rome, Frascati, Neaples, and Caserta.\nPost-abdication.\nOn 7 March 1802, Charles Emmanuel's wife, Clotilde of France, died, he was so moved by her death that he decided to abdicate, on 4 June 1802, in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I. Charles Emmanuel retained the personal title of king. He lived in Rome and in the nearby town of Frascati.\nIn Frascati he was a frequent guest of his cousin Henry Benedict Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York, last member of the royal House of Stuart. Charles was descended from Henrietta Anne Stuart, the youngest daughter of King Charles I of England, whereas Henry Benedict Stuart was descended from Henrietta Anne's brother James II. When Henry died in 1807, Charles Emmanuel became the heir-general of Charles I, and thus inherited the Jacobite claim to the British thrones. Unlike his three predecessors, however, neither he nor his successors ever made any attempt to claim the throne.\nIn 1815, at the age of sixty-four, Charles Emmanuel took simple vows in the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). He was never ordained to the priesthood but lived the rest of his life at the Jesuit novitiate in Rome.\nCharles Emmanuel died at the Palazzo Colonna in Rome on 6 October 1819. He is buried in the Church of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Subsequently, Euler presented other proofs of the theorem, culminating with his paper of 1763, in which he proved a generalization to the case where n is not prime.\nThe converse of Euler's theorem is also true: if the above congruence is true, then formula_5 and formula_6 must be coprime.\nThe theorem is further generalized by some of Carmichael's theorems.\nThe theorem may be used to easily reduce large powers modulo formula_6. For example, consider finding the ones place decimal digit of formula_8, i.e. formula_9. The integers 7 and 10 are coprime, and formula_10. So Euler's theorem yields formula_11, and we get formula_12.\nIn general, when reducing a power of formula_5 modulo formula_6 (where formula_5 and formula_6 are coprime), one needs to work modulo formula_17 in the exponent of formula_5:\nif formula_19, then formula_20.\nEuler's theorem underlies the RSA cryptosystem, which is widely used in Internet communications. In this cryptosystem, Euler's theorem is used with n being a product of two large prime numbers, and the security of the system is based on the difficulty of factoring such an integer.\nProofs.\n1. Euler's theorem can be proven using concepts from the theory of groups: \nThe residue classes modulo n that are coprime to n form a group under multiplication (see the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo \"n\" for details). The order of that group is \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"). Lagrange's theorem states that the order of any subgroup of a finite group divides the order of the entire group, in this case \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"). If a is any number coprime to n then a is in one of these residue classes, and its powers \"a\", \"a\"2, ... , \"a\"\"k\" modulo n form a subgroup of the group of residue classes, with \"a\"\"k\" \u2261 1 (mod \"n\"). Lagrange's theorem says k must divide \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"), i.e. there is an integer M such that \"kM\" \n \"\u03c6\"(\"n\"). This then implies,\nformula_21\n2. There is also a direct proof: Let \"R\" \n {\"x\"1, \"x\"2, ... , \"x\"\"\u03c6\"(\"n\")} be a reduced residue system (mod \"n\") and let a be any integer coprime to n. The proof hinges on the fundamental fact that multiplication by a permutes the xi: in other words if \"axj\" \u2261 \"axk\" (mod \"n\") then \"j\" \n \"k\". (This law of cancellation is proved in the article Multiplicative group of integers modulo \"n\".) That is, the sets R and \"aR\" \n {\"ax\"1, \"ax\"2, ... , \"ax\"\"\u03c6\"(\"n\")}, considered as sets of congruence classes (mod \"n\"), are identical (as sets\u2014they may be listed in different orders), so the product of all the numbers in R is congruent (mod \"n\") to the product of all the numbers in aR:\nformula_22 and using the cancellation law to cancel each xi gives Euler's theorem:\nformula_23\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nThe \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" has been translated from Gauss's Ciceronian Latin into English and German.

{"id": "69567", "revid": "48658564", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69567", "title": "Potiphar", "text": "Biblical character\nPotiphar ( ; ; ) is a figure in the Hebrew Bible and the Quran. His name possibly indicates the same figure as Potiphera ().\nPotiphar is the captain of the guard for a pharaoh who is said to have purchased Joseph as a slave and, impressed by his intelligence, makes him the master of his household. Potiphar's wife, who was known for her infidelities, took a liking to Joseph and attempted to seduce him. When Joseph refused her advances and ran off, leaving his outer vestment in her hands, she retaliated by falsely accusing him of trying to rape her, and Potiphar had Joseph imprisoned.\nWhat happened to Potiphar after that is unclear; some sources identify him as Potipherah, an Egyptian priest whose daughter, Asenath, marries Joseph. The false accusation by Potiphar's wife plays an important role in Joseph's narrative because had he not been imprisoned, he would not have met the fellow prisoner who introduced him to Pharaoh. Likewise, the fate of Potiphar's wife is unclear but some sources say she was stricken with illness.\nRachel Adelman suggests that both Potiphar and his wife were sexually attracted to Joseph and tried to use him for their own purposes. But Potiphar's attempts were thwarted via castration, according to Talmudic legend. She believes the story is a criticism of Jewish assimilation since foreigners like Potiphar and his wife would seduce Jews to sin.\nThe medieval Sefer HaYashar, a commentary on the Torah, gives Potiphar's wife's name as \"Zuleikha\", as do many Islamic traditions - hence the Persian poem, titled Yusuf and Zulaikha, which also has Persian miniatures of the couple, from Jami's \"Haft Awrang\" (\"Seven thrones\").\nThe story became prevalent in Western art during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, usually depicting the moment when Joseph tears himself away from the bed containing a more or less naked figure of Potiphar's wife.\nReligious references.\nTying Potiphar or Joseph accurately to a particular pharaoh or period is difficult. According to the Jewish calendar, Joseph was purchased in the year 2216, which is 1544 BC, at the end of the Second Intermediate Period or the very beginning of the New Kingdom. The Torah in which the story appears (before the Bible and the Quran) was the earliest written of the three: c. 600 BC during the Babylonian Exile. According to the documentary hypothesis, the story of Potiphar and his wife is credited to the Yahwist source and stands in the same place as the stories of the butler and the baker and Pharaoh's dreams stand in the Elohist text.\nA similar story is found in the Tale of Two Brothers, where the wife of Anpu tries to seduce his brother Bata.\nIslam.\nThe story is first related in Quran 12:21\u201335: an Egyptian purchases Joseph and proposes to adopt him. The Egyptian's wife endeavors to seduce Joseph, but he is preserved from her enticements. She accuses Joseph of an attempt to dishonor her. The rent in his garment testifies to Joseph's innocence. The Azeez believes Joseph and condemns his wife. The sin of the Azeez's wife becomes known in the city (). Seeing Joseph's beauty, the wives of other noblemen call him an angel. The Azeez's wife declares her purpose to imprison Joseph unless he yields to her solicitations. Joseph seeks protection from God, who hears his prayer and turns aside their snares, but Joseph is imprisoned notwithstanding his innocence."}
{"id": "69569", "revid": "13127810", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69569", "title": "Vanir", "text": "Subgroup of Norse deities\nIn Norse mythology, the Vanir (; Old Norse:, singular Vanr) are a group of gods associated with fertility, wisdom, and the ability to see the future. The Vanir are one of two groups of gods (the other being the \u00c6sir) and are the namesake of the location Vanaheimr (Old Norse \"Home of the Vanir\"). After the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, the Vanir became a subgroup of the \u00c6sir. Subsequently, at least some members of the Vanir are at times also referred to as being \u00c6sir.\nThe Vanir are attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the \"Prose Edda\" and \"Heimskringla\", both written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in the poetry of skalds. The Vanir are attested only in these Old Norse sources.\nAll sources describe the god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r, and his children Freyr and Freyja as members of the Vanir. A euhemerized prose account in \"Heimskringla\" adds that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister\u2014whose name is not provided\u2014and Kvasir were Vanir. In addition, \"Heimskringla\" reports a tale involving king Sveig\u00f0ir's visit to Vanaheimr, where he meets a woman by the name of Vana and the two produce a child named Vanlandi (whose name means \"Man from the Land of the Vanir\").\nWhile not attested as Vanir, the gods Heimdall and Ullr have been theorized as potential members of the group. In the \"Prose Edda\", a name listed for boars is \"Van-child\". Scholars have theorized that the Vanir may be connected to small pieces of gold foil found in Scandinavia at some building sites from the Migration Period to the Viking Age and occasionally in graves. They have speculated whether the Vanir originally represented pre-Indo-European deities or Indo-European fertility gods, and have theorized a form of the gods as venerated by the pagan Anglo-Saxons.\nEtymology.\nNumerous theories have been proposed for the etymology of \"Vanir\". Scholar R. I. Page says that, while there is no shortage of etymologies for the word, it is tempting to link the word with Old Norse \"vinr\" ('friend') and Latin \"Venus\" ('goddess of physical love'). \"Vanir\" is sometimes anglicized to \"Wanes\" (singular \"Wane\").\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", the Vanir, as a group, are specifically referenced in the poems \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\", \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\", \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\", \"Alv\u00edssm\u00e1l\", and \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\". In \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", a stanza describes the events of the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, noting that during the war the Vanir broke the walls of the stronghold of the \u00c6sir, and that the Vanir were \"indomitable, trampling the plain\".\nIn \"Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l\", Gagnr\u00e1\u00f0r (the god Odin in disguise) engages in a game of wits with the j\u00f6tunn Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir. Gagnr\u00e1\u00f0r asks Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir where the Van god Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r came from, for though he rules over many hofs and h\u00f6rgrs, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was not raised among the \u00c6sir. Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nir responds that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was created in Vanaheimr (\"home of the Vanir\") by \"wise powers\" and details that during the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was exchanged as a hostage. In addition, when the world ends (Ragnar\u00f6k), Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r \"will return to the wise Vanir\".\n\"Alv\u00edssm\u00e1l\" consists of question and answer exchanges between the dwarf Alv\u00edss and the god Thor. In the poem, Alv\u00edss supplies terms that various groups, including the Vanir, use to refer to various subjects. Alv\u00edss attributes nine terms to the Vanir; one for Earth (\"The Ways\"), Heaven (\"The Weaver of Winds\"), clouds (\"Kites of the Wind\"), calm (\"The Hush of the Winds\"), the sea (\"The Wave\"), fire (\"Wildfire\"), wood (\"The Wand\"), seed (\"growth\"), and ale (\"The Foaming\").\nThe poem \"\u00derymskvi\u00f0a\" states that the god Heimdallr possesses foreknowledge, \"as the Vanir also can\". \"Sigrdr\u00edfum\u00e1l\" records that the Vanir are in possession of a \"sacred mead\". In the poem, the valkyrie Sigrdr\u00edfa provides mystical lore about runes to the hero Sigurd. Sigrdr\u00edfa notes that runes were once carved on to various creatures, deities, and other figures, and then shaved off and mixed with a \"sacred mead\". This mead is possessed by the \u00c6sir, the elves, mankind, and the Vanir.\nIn \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\", the beautiful j\u00f6tunn Ger\u00f0r first encounters the god Freyr's messenger Sk\u00edrnir, and asks him if he is of the elves, of the \u00c6sir, or of the \"wise Vanir\". Sk\u00edrnir responds that he is not of any of the three groups. Later in the poem, Sk\u00edrnir is successful in his threats against Ger\u00f0r (to have Ger\u00f0r accept Freyr's affections), and Ger\u00f0r offers Sk\u00edrnir a crystal cup full of mead, noting that she never thought that she would love one of the Vanir.\n\"Prose Edda\".\nThe Vanir are mentioned in the \"Prose Edda\" books and . In chapter 23 of , the enthroned figure of High relates that Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r was raised in Vanaheimr. High says that during the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, the Vanir sent Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as a hostage to the \u00c6sir, and the \u00c6sir sent to the Vanir the god H\u0153nir. The sending of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r as a hostage resulted in a peace agreement between the \u00c6sir and the Vanir.\nChapter 35 provides information regarding the goddess Freyja, including that one of her names is \"D\u00eds of the Vanir\". In the same chapter, High tells that the goddess Gn\u00e1 rides the horse H\u00f3fvarpnir, and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea. High continues that \"once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air\" and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says, in verse (for which no source is provided):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGn\u00e1 responds:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nIn chapter 57 of , the god Bragi explains the origin of poetry. Bragi says the origin of poetry lies in the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War. During the peace conference held to end the war both the \u00c6sir and the Vanir formed a truce by spitting into a vat. When they left, the gods decided that it should not be poured out, but rather kept as a symbol of their peace, and so from the contents they made a man; Kvasir. Kvasir is later murdered by dwarves, and from his blood the Mead of Poetry is made.\nIn chapter 6, poetic names for Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r are provided, including \"descendant of Vanir or a Van\". As reference, a poem by the 11th century skald \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0r Sj\u00e1reksson is provided where Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r is described as a Vanr. In chapter 7, poetic names for Freyr are listed, including names that reference his association with the Vanir; \"Vanir god\", \"descendant of Vanir\", and \"a Van\". Freyja is also repeatedly cited as a Vanr. In chapter 20, some of Freyja's names are listed and include \"Van-deity\" and \"Van-lady\", and chapter 37 provides skaldic verse referring to Freyja as \"Van-bride\". In chapter 75, names for pigs are provided, including \"Van-child\", a name shared with Freyr.\n\"Heimskringla\".\nThe \"Heimskringla\" book \"Ynglinga saga\" (chapter\u00a04) provides an euhemerized account of the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War. As a peace agreement, the two sides agreed to trade hostages. The Vanir sent Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and Freyr to the \u00c6sir, and in turn the \u00c6sir sent H\u0153nir and M\u00edmir to the Vanir.\nUpon receiving M\u00edmir, the Vanir sent the \"cleverest amongst them\", Kvasir. In Vanaheimr, the Vanir made H\u0153nir a chieftain. However, whenever H\u0153nir appeared at assemblies or meetings where the Vanir asked him his opinion on difficult issues, his response was \"let others decide\". The Vanir suspected that they had been cheated by the \u00c6sir in the hostage exchange, and so grabbed hold of M\u00edmir, cut off M\u00edmir's head, and sent it to the \u00c6sir.\nThe same chapter describes that while Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r lived among the Vanir, his wife (unnamed) was his sister, and the couple had two children: Freyr and Freyja. However, \"among the \u00c6sir it was forbidden to marry so near a kin\". By Odin's appointment, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r and his son Freyr became priests over offerings of sacrifice, and they were recognized as gods among the \u00c6sir. Freyja was priestess at the sacrifices, and \"it was she who first taught the \u00c6sir magic as was practiced among the Vanir\".\nIn chapter\u00a015, the king Sveig\u00f0ir is recorded as having married a woman named Vana in \"Vanaland\", located in Sweden. The two produced a child, who they named Vanlandi (Old Norse \"Man from the Land of the Vanir\".\nArchaeological record.\nSmall pieces of gold foil decorated with pictures of figures dating from the Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as \"gullgubber\") have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, in one case almost 2,500. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves.\nThe figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes a man and a woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings and linked to the Vanir, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Sk\u00edrnism\u00e1l\"; the coming together of the Vanir god Freyr and his love, Ger\u00f0r.\nScholarly reception.\nHistoricists and structuralists.\nMuch of the discussion among scholars on the topic of the Vanir has historically been on the question of whether the Vanir are the reflection of a purported historic meeting between different peoples in the ancient past (\"historicists\") or an extension of Proto-Indo-European mythology where such a narrative may have existed for complex social reasons (\"structuralists\") among the early Indo-European peoples, and thereafter spread to their descendants. Notable proponents of the historicist position include Karl Helm, Ernst Alfred Philippson, Lotte Motz, and Lotte Headegger, whereas notable proponents of the structuralist view include Georges Dum\u00e9zil, Jan de Vries, and Gabriel Turville-Petre. The structuralist view has generally gained the most support among academics, although with caveats, including among Jens Peter Schj\u00f8dt, Margaret Clunies Ross, and Thomas DuBois.\nLike the Vanr goddess Freyja, the Vanir as a group are not attested outside Scandinavia. Traditionally, following \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" and the \"Prose Edda\", scholarship on the Vanir has focused on the \u00c6sir\u2013Vanir War, its possible basis in a war between peoples, and whether the Vanir originated as the deities of a distinct people. Some scholars have doubted that they were known outside Scandinavia; however, there is evidence that the god Freyr is the same god as the Germanic deity Ing (reconstructed as Proto-Germanic \"*Ingwaz\"), and that, if so, he is attested as having been known among the Goths.\nMembership, elves, ship symbolism, \"field of the dead\", and \"vanitates\".\nHilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that all of the wives of the gods may have originally been members of the Vanir, noting that many of them appear to have originally been children of j\u00f6tnar. Davidson additionally notes that \"it is the Vanir and Odin who seem to receive the most hostile treatment in Christian stories about mythological personages\".\nJoseph S. Hopkins and Haukur \u00deorgeirsson, building on suggestions by archaeologist Ole Crumlin-Pedersen and others, link the Vanir to ship burial customs among the North Germanic peoples, proposing an early Germanic model of a ship in a \"field of the dead\" that may be represented both by Freyja's afterlife field F\u00f3lkvangr and by the Old English Neorxnawang (the mysterious first element of which may be linked to the name of Freyja's father, Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r).\nRichard North theorizes that glossing Latin \"vanitates\" (\"vanities\", \"idols\") for \"gods\" in Old English sources implies the existence of \"*uuani\" (a reconstructed cognate to Old Norse \"Vanir\") in Deiran dialect and hence that the gods that Edwin of Northumbria and the northern Angles worshiped in pre-Christian Anglo-Saxon England were likely to have been the *\"uuani\". He comments that they likely \"shared not only the name but also the orgiastic character of the [Old Icelandic] \"Vanir\"\".\nAlaric Hall has equated the Vanir with the elves.\nRudolf Simek's \"Vanir Obituary\".\nIn a 2010 piece building on an earlier proposal by Lotte Motz, Rudolf Simek argues that \"vanir\" was originally nothing more than a general term for deities like \"\u00e6sir\", and that its employment as a name for a distinct group of deities was an invention of Snorri, whom he identifies as the author of the \"Prose Edda\". According to Simek, the Vanir are therefore \"a figment of imagination from the 13th to 20th centuries\". Simek states that he \"believe[s] that these are not mistakes that we are dealing with here, but a deliberate invention on the part of Snorri\".\nSimek's argument receive some level of support from Frog and Jonathan Roper (2011), who analyze the small corpus of poetic usages of \"Vanir\". The authors suggest that this implies that \"vanir\" was a \"suspended archaism\" used as a metrical alternative to \"\u00c6sir\" but with the caveat that \"These observations should not, however, be considered to present a solution to the riddle of \"vanir\"\". In a collection of papers in honor of Simek, Frog (2021) states support for Simek's proposal.\nHowever, Simek's proposal has been rejected by several scholars, including Clive Tolley, Leszek P. S\u0142upecki, Jens Peter Schj\u00f8dt, and Terry Gunnell. Tolley argues that the term must have originated in historical usage, and that \"it is something of a misrepresentation of the evidence to suggest that Snorri is the main source for the \"vanir\"\". Tolley continues:\n \"the evidence affords opportunity to interpret the \"vanir\" as a class of beings with a cohesive functionality, as I have attempted to show. In turn, since this functionality can be shown to mirror concerns with a widespread occurrence within comparative religious studies, there is good reason for maintaining the importance of the \"vanir\" as a discrete group of divine beings. I would even venture to suggest that\u2014far from being minor characters in the Norse pantheon, as Simek and others believe\u2014the \"vanir\" are likely to have been involved in the most intimate and central aspects of human existence, as my analysis of their functions shows.\n It may well be for this very reason that Christian missionaries such as St.\u00a0\u00d3l\u00e1fr were intent upon their eradication, leaving us so little information. If, as \"V\u01eblusp\u00e1\" intimates, the \"vanir\" were particularly the \"sweet scent\", the darlings, of women, there may have been even greater incentive for the new muscular and masculine Christianity to ensure their demise, as a cult fostered by the guardians of the home would be a serious threat to the spread of the new religion.\"\nS\u0142upecki argues that the Vanir remained distinct from the \u00c6sir \u2013 except for Freyja and Freyr, whom he follows the \"Prose Edda\" in seeing as having been born after Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r became a hostage among the \u00c6sir, and thus regards as \u00c6sir \u2013 and therefore that Ragnar\u00f6k \"[has] no importance for their world\".\nAccording to Jens Peter Schj\u00f8dt,\n\"even if the term Vanir were not in existence in pagan times, it does not change substantially the fact that in pre-Christian Scandinavian mythology we deal with two groups of gods who sometimes overlap, whereas at other times they are clearly distinguished, just as to be expected in an anthropomorphic mythology. It would be wrong to look for coherence in any mythology. As I have considered in more detail elsewhere, what we can realistically hope to reconstruct is not a coherent mythological or theological system, as this seems to be more of an ideal dream among scholars who are strongly influenced by an older sort of theology, but rather a set of variants that may be part of a deep structure, although with internal contradictions among the various myth-complexes and various 'loose ends'. In the real world, among real people, such coherence is, as a general rule, absent.\"\nSchj\u00f8dt, in response to Simek's piece, says:\n\"the conclusion, in relation to Simek's article would be, then, that even if he should be right about the Vanir, we would still be better off if we had a designation for the gods we have traditionally seen as belonging to the Vanir group. And perhaps \"Vanir\", then, in spite of all the uncertainties that accrue to it, would still be the most convenient term.\"\nTerry Gunnell proposes that the Vanir's\n\"recurring patterns in the narratives nonetheless imply that in the oral traditions of Norway and Iceland, people seem to have viewed the religious activities connected with the 'Vanir' (with their center in Sweden) as having been different in nature to those encountered elsewhere. They also seem to have been envisioned closer connections between the Vanir and the landscape than existed between the \u00c6sir and the natural environment.\"\nGunnell concludes that\n\"this evidence lends weight to the argument that, in spite of recent arguments to the contrary, the religion associated with the Vanir and \u00c6sir gods had a different nature and origin.\"\nModern influence.\nThe Vanir are featured in the poem \"Om vanerne\" by Oehlenschl\u00e4ger (1819). Some Germanic Neopagans refer to their beliefs as \"Vanatr\u00fa\" (meaning \"those who honor the Vanir\").\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Under his rule, Bulgaria entered the First World War on the side of the Central Powers in 1915.\nFamily background.\nFerdinand was born on 26 February 1861 in Vienna, a German prince of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koh\u00e1ry. He was the son of Prince August of Saxe-Coburg and his wife Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans, daughter of King Louis Philippe I of France. Princess Maria Antonia Koh\u00e1ry was a Hungarian Noble and heiress who married Ferdinand's grandfather, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Ferdinand was raised in his parents\u2019 Catholic faith and baptised in St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna on 27 February, having as godparents Archduke Maximilian of Austria and his wife Princess Charlotte of Belgium. He grew up in the cosmopolitan environment of Austro-Hungarian high nobility and also in their ancestral lands in Hungary and in Germany. The House of Koh\u00e1ry descended from an immensely wealthy Upper Hungarian noble family, who held the princely lands of \u010cabra\u010f and Sitno in present-day Slovakia, among others. The family's property was augmented by Cl\u00e9mentine of Orl\u00e9ans' remarkable dowry.\nFerdinand was a grandnephew of Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and of Leopold I, first king of the Belgians. His father August was a brother of King Ferdinand II of Portugal, and also a first cousin to Queen Victoria, her husband Albert, Empress Carlota of Mexico and her brother Leopold II of Belgium. These last two, Leopold and Carlota, were also first cousins of Ferdinand I's through his mother, a princess of Orl\u00e9ans. This made the Belgian siblings his first cousins, as well as his first cousins once removed. Indeed, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha had contrived to occupy, either by marriage or by direct election, several European thrones in the course of the 19th century. Following the family trend, Ferdinand was himself to found the royal dynasty of Bulgaria.\nPrince of Bulgaria.\nThe previous ruling prince of Bulgaria, Alexander of Battenberg, had abdicated in 1886 after a pro-Russian coup, only seven years after he had been elected. Ferdinand, who was an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, was elected Prince of autonomous Bulgaria by its Grand National Assembly on 7 July 1887 in the Gregorian calendar (the \"New Style\" used hereinafter). The throne had been previously offered, before Ferdinand's acceptance, to princes from Denmark to the Caucasus and even to the King of Romania. The Russian tsar himself had nominated his aide, Nichols Dadian of Mingrelia, but his candidacy was rejected by the Bulgarians. Ferdinand's accession was greeted with disbelief in many of the royal houses of Europe; Queen Victoria, his father's first cousin, stated to her prime minister, \"He is totally unfit\u00a0... delicate, eccentric and effeminate\u00a0... Should be stopped at once.\" To the amazement of his initial detractors, Ferdinand generally gave a good account of himself during the first two decades of his reign.\nBulgaria's domestic political life was dominated during the early years of Ferdinand's reign by liberal party leader Stefan Stambolov, whose foreign policy saw a marked cooling in relations with Russia, formerly seen as Bulgaria's protector.\nStambolov's fall (May 1894) and subsequent assassination (July 1895) \u2014 probably not engineered by Ferdinand \u2014 paved the way for a reconciliation of Bulgaria with Russia, effected in February 1896 with Ferdinand's decision to convert his infant son, Prince Boris, from Roman Catholicism to Eastern Orthodoxy. However, this earned him the animosity of his Catholic Austrian relatives, and he was excommunicated by Pope Leo XIII.\nTsar of Bulgaria.\nOn 5 October 1908 (celebrated on 22 September), Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria's \"de jure\" independence from the Ottoman Empire (though the country had been \"de facto\" independent since 1878). He also proclaimed Bulgaria a kingdom, and assumed the title of \"tsar\"\u2014a deliberate nod to the rulers of the earlier Bulgarian states. However, while the title \"tsar\" was translated as \"emperor\" in the First and Second Bulgarian empires, it was translated as \"king\" under Ferdinand and his successors. The Bulgarian Declaration of Independence was proclaimed by him at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo, and was recognized by the Ottoman Empire and the other European powers. The Tarnovo Constitution was retained, with the word \"prince\" replaced by the word \"\"tsar\".\"\nOn a visit to German Emperor Wilhelm II, his second cousin once removed, in 1909, Ferdinand was leaning out of a window of the New Palace in Potsdam when the Emperor came up behind him and slapped him on the bottom. Ferdinand was affronted by the gesture, but the Kaiser refused to apologize. Ferdinand however exacted his revenge by awarding a valuable arms contract he had intended to give to the Krupp's factory in Essen to French arms manufacturer Schneider-Creusot. Another incident occurred on his journey to the funeral of his second cousin King Edward VII of the United Kingdom in 1910. A tussle broke out over where his private railway carriage would be positioned in relation to the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The Archduke won out, having his carriage positioned directly behind the engine. Ferdinand's was placed directly behind his. Realising the dining car of the train was behind his own carriage, Ferdinand obtained his revenge on the Archduke by refusing him passage through his own carriage to the dining car. On 15 July the same year during a visit to Belgium, Ferdinand also became the first head of state to fly in an airplane. He awarded the pilot of the plane with a medal when they landed.\nBalkan Wars (1912\u20131913).\nLike many other rulers before him, Ferdinand desired the creation of a \"new Byzantium\", a desire that has to be interpreted as wanting to create a significant, essentially Christian, Balkan power, given that Bulgaria and Bulgarians had neither cultural, ethnic, historical nor linguistic affinity with the old Byzantine Empire, which was quintessentially Roman and, evolving through the centuries, Greek. In 1912, Ferdinand joined the other Balkan states in an assault on the Ottoman Empire to free occupied territories. He saw this war as a new crusade declaring it, \"a just, great and sacred struggle of the Cross against the Crescent.\" Bulgaria contributed the most and also lost the greatest number of soldiers. The Great Powers insisted on the creation of an independent Albania. Though the Balkan League allies had fought together against the common enemy in the First Balkan War, that was not enough to overcome their mutual rivalries. In the original documents for the Balkan League, Serbia had been pressured by Bulgaria to hand over most of Vardar Macedonia after it had conquered it from the Ottoman Empire. However Serbia, in response to the new Albanian state receiving territory in the north that it had expected to gain for itself, said that it would keep possession of the areas that its forces had occupied. Soon after, Bulgaria began the Second Balkan War when it invaded its recent allies Serbia and Greece to seize disputed areas, before being attacked itself by Romania and the Ottoman Empire. Although Bulgaria was defeated, the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest granted the Kingdom some territorial gains. The region of Western Thrace, giving access to the Aegean Sea was secured.\nFirst World War and abdication (1915\u20131918).\nOn 11 October 1915, the Bulgarian army attacked Serbia after signing a treaty with Austria-Hungary and Germany stating that Bulgaria would gain the territory it sought at the expense of Serbia. While he was not an admirer of German Emperor Wilhelm II or Austrian Emperor Franz Josef I\u2014whom he described as \"that idiot, that old dotard of a Francis Joseph\"\u2014Ferdinand wanted additional territorial gains after the humiliation of the Balkan Wars. This also entailed forming an alliance with his former enemy, the Ottoman Empire. This ranging of his country with the Central Powers made him a de facto supporter of Germany's war aims and was not well received by the Allies. Edmund Gosse wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In this war, where the ranks of the enemy present to us so many formidable, sinister, and shocking figures, there is one, and perhaps but one, which is purely ridiculous. If we had the heart to relieve our strained feelings by laughter, it would be at the gross Coburg traitor, with his bodyguard of assassins and his hidden coat-of-mail, his shaking hands and his painted face. The world has never seen a meaner scoundrel, and we may almost bring ourselves to pity the Kaiser, whom circumstances have forced to accept on equal terms a potentate so verminous.\nDuring the initial phase of World War I, the Tsardom of Bulgaria achieved several decisive victories over its enemies and laid claim to the disputed territories of Macedonia after Serbia's defeat. For the next two years, the Bulgarian army shifted its focus towards repelling Allied advances from nearby Greece. They were also partially involved in the 1916 conquest of neighboring Romania, now ruled by another Ferdinand I, who was also Ferdinand's first cousin once removed.\nTo save the Bulgarian monarchy after multiple military setbacks in 1918, Tsar Ferdinand in favour of his eldest son, who became Tsar Boris III on 3 October 1918. Under new leadership, Bulgaria surrendered to the Entente and, as a consequence, lost not only the additional territory it had fought for in the major conflict, but also the territory it had won after the Balkan Wars giving access to the Aegean Sea.\nPersonal life.\nAccording to her memoirs, Ferdinand I was vehemently in love with Archduchess Louise of Austria, and proposed marriage to her, but she refused:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let me assure you at once that I do not and could not love you, and should not be happy as your wife. I quite realise your worldly advantages, but you would never be able to give me real happiness. I'm sure you only want to marry me because I am an Austrian Archduchess; the word Archduchess stands for love in your vocabulary, and you have promised your ministers to return to Bulgaria betrothed to me. Well I shall not marry you. You'd better go to the Duke of Parma and ask him for my cousin, Marie-Louise.\nFerdinand married Princess Marie Louise of Bourbon-Parma, daughter of Robert I, Duke of Parma and Princess Maria Pia of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, on 20 April 1893 at the Villa Pianore in Lucca. Steven Constant describes this as a \"marriage of convenience\". The marriage produced four children:\nMarie Louise died on 31 January 1899 after giving birth to her youngest daughter. Ferdinand did not think about remarriage until his mother, Princess Cl\u00e9mentine, died in 1907. To satisfy dynastic obligations and to provide his children with a mother figure, Ferdinand married Princess Eleonore Reuss of K\u00f6stritz, on 28 February 1908. Neither romantic love or physical attraction played any role, and Ferdinand treated her as no more than a member of the household, and showed scant regard.\nIn his private relations, Ferdinand was a somewhat hedonistic individual. He enjoyed affairs with a number of women of humble position, siring a number of illegitimate children whom he then supported financially. In his later life, rumours abounded of Ferdinand's trysts with lieutenants and valets. His regular holidays on Capri, then a popular holiday destination with wealthy epicenes, were common knowledge in royal courts throughout Europe.\nHe was remembered in his cousin's memoir:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Prince Ferdinand, who was a Coburg, was a cousin of my father\u2019s, and I remember the latter saying, when we got back to the hotel, that being the youngest of his family he was naturally looked upon as a fool, \"But,\" said my father, \"for the fool of the family he has not done so badly for himself and I should not be surprised if he did not prove them all to be wrong.\" He was always mocked at by his relations for covering himself with orders and decorations created by himself, and he was rudely nicknamed \u201cthe Christmas-tree.\u201d\nExile and death (1918\u20131948).\nAfter his abdication, Ferdinand returned to live in Coburg, Germany. He had managed to salvage much of his fortune and was able to live in some style. He saw his being in exile simply as one of the hazards of kingship. He commented, \"Kings in exile are more philosophic under reverses than ordinary individuals; but our philosophy is primarily the result of tradition and breeding, and do not forget that pride is an important item in the making of a monarch. We are disciplined from the day of our birth and taught the avoidance of all outward signs of emotion. The skeleton sits forever with us at the feast. It may mean murder, it may mean abdication, but it serves always to remind us of the unexpected. Therefore we are prepared and nothing comes in the nature of a catastrophe. The main thing in life is to support any condition of bodily or spiritual exile with dignity. If one sups with sorrow, one need not invite the world to see you eat.\" He was pleased that the throne could pass to his son. Ferdinand was not displeased with exile and spent much of his time devoted to artistic endeavors, gardening, travel and natural history. In 1922 the Bulgarian government gave former King Ferdinand I, who had been living in exile since 1918, permission to return to Sofia. The Kingdom of Yugoslavia immediately sent an ultimatum objecting to the move.\nHowever, he would live to see the collapse of everything he had held to be precious in life. His eldest son and successor, Boris III, died under mysterious circumstances after returning from a visit to Hitler in Germany in 1943. Boris' son, Simeon II, succeeded him only to be deposed in 1946, ending the Bulgarian monarchy. The Kingdom of Bulgaria was succeeded by the People's Republic of Bulgaria, under which Ferdinand's other son, Kyril, was executed. On hearing of Kyril's death he said, \"Everything is collapsing around me.\"\nIn 1947, Ferdinand (then 86 years old) secretly married his 26-year-old assistant Al\u017ebeta Brez\u00e1kov\u00e1 in Bamberg, Germany, much to the displeasure of the members of his family. After his death, she returned to her homeland Czechoslovakia, where she remarried and had a daughter. Being afraid of what the communist regime might do to her, she only told her daughter about her marriage to Ferdinand two years before her death. She survived her husband by 67 years and died in Bratislava, Slovakia in 2015.\nFerdinand died in B\u00fcrglass-Schl\u00f6sschen on 10 September 1948 in Coburg, Germany, cradle of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha dynasty. He was the last surviving grandchild of Louis-Philippe of France. His final wish was to be buried in Bulgaria. However, the Communist authorities in Bulgaria would not allow it, so he was buried in the family crypt in St. Augustin, Coburg.\nOn 29 May 2024, the remains of Ferdinand I of Bulgaria were transported from Coburg to Sofia by a military plane, which landed at Sofia Airport. They were transported from Germany to Bulgaria by a military aircraft in accordance with the decision adopted by the Council of Ministers. The coffin was taken down and carried by national guards and solemnly placed in a hearse which left for the royal Vrana Palace on the outskirts of Sofia, where Ferdinand I was buried.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Shortly thereafter, his brother Charles Felix ascended the throne as the new king of Sardinia. Victor Emmanuel was the son of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain. In 1789, he married Maria Theresa of Austria-Este, with whom he had seven children, including the future Empress of Austria. He was the King of Sardinia during the Napoleonic Wars, where he regained Piedmont after Napoleon's defeat in 1814.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nVictor Emmanuel was born on 24 July 1754 at the Royal Palace of Turin in Turin, Italy. He was the second son of King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia, son of King Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia and Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg, and his wife, Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain, daughter of King Philip V of Spain and Elisabeth Farnese.\nVictor Emmanuel was known from birth as the Duke of Aosta. From 1792 to 1796, Victor Emmanuel\u2019s father had taken an active part in the struggle of the old powers against the revolutionary forces in France but was defeated and forced to make peace, signing the Treaty of Paris. The old king died shortly thereafter, and in December 1798, his eldest son and successor, Charles Emmanuel IV, was faced with a French occupation and eventually annexation, of his mainland territories.\nFlight to Sardinia and accession.\nCharles Emmanuel and his family were forced to withdraw to Sardinia, which was the only part of his domains not conquered by the French. Charles Emmanuel himself took little interest in the rule of Sardinia, living with his wife on the mainland in Naples and Rome until his wife's death in 1802, which led the childless Charles Emmanuel to abdicate the throne in favour of his younger brother.\nVictor Emmanuel took the throne on 4 June 1802 as Victor Emmanuel I. He ruled Sardinia from Cagliari for the next twelve years, during which time he constituted the Carabinieri, a Gendarmerie corps, still existing as one of the main branches of the Italy's Armed Forces.\nIn 1814, Napoleon was defeated, and Victor Emmanuel was able to return to Turin. His realm was reconstituted by the Congress of Vienna, with the addition of the territories of the former Republic of Genoa, and well he also wanted to annex Monaco, but it only became a protectorate of his Kingdom. The latter became the seat of the Sardinian Navy. Victor Emmanuel abolished all the freedoms granted by the Napoleonic Codices and restored a fiercely oppressive rule: he restored the \"Regie Costituzioni\" of Victor Amadeus II and the \"Jus commune\", strengthened customs barriers, refused to grant a liberal constitution, entrusted education to the Church and reintroduced laws concerning labour and the justice system which discriminated against Jews and Waldensians.\nHe nurtured expansionist ambitions in Lombardy, where nationalist anti-Austrian sentiments had developed, promoted largely by the bourgeoisie. This led to conflict with Austria. In March 1821, a liberal revolution exploded in Italy, largely the work of the Carbonari and it seemed that the anti-Austrian attitude of the revolutionaries matched that of Victor Emmanuel.\nAbdication and later life.\nOn Sunday 11 March 1821, the King called a meeting with the council of the crown, of which the members also included one of his distant cousins, Charles Albert. However, Victor Emmanuel was not willing to grant a liberal constitution as desired by the revolutionaries, so he abdicated the next day in favour of his brother, Charles Felix, on 12 March 1821. Because Charles Felix was in Modena at the time, Victor Emmanuel temporarily entrusted the regency to Charles Albert, who was second in line to the throne.\nSince his abdication, Victor Emmanuel lived in several cities until 1824, when he returned to the Castle of Moncalieri, where he died.

He was the last male-line member of the House of Savoy that started with Victor Amadeus I, and caused the line of Victor Amadeus I's younger brother Thomas Francis to seize the throne after Felix's death.\nEarly life.\nCharles Felix was born in Turin as the eleventh child and fifth son born to Victor Amadeus III of Savoy and Maria Antonia Ferdinanda of Spain. His paternal grandparents were Charles Emmanuel III of Savoy and his German wife Polyxena of Hesse-Rotenburg. His maternal grandparents were French-born King Philip V of Spain and his Italian wife, Elisabeth Farnese.\nHe was a younger brother of two other rulers of Savoy Charles Emmanuel IV and Victor Emmanuel I. He spent his childhood with his sister Maria Carolina and his younger brother, Giuseppe Benedetto Placido, Count of Moriana, at the Castle of Moncalieri.\nFrom his youth, Carlo Felice was reported as having a very complex character: on the one hand consistent and inflexible, private, distrustful, and impulsive, if not touchy and vindictive; on the other hand honest, sincere, and capable of emotion and fondness. He had a clever mind, at times even ironic. He possessed a sacral conception of the monarchy and the right to reign.\nDuring the years of the French Revolution and the Italian campaign, Charles Felix formed part of a \"parallel court\" opposed to Charles Emmanuel IV's circle, along with his brother Victor Emmanuel, the latter's wife Maria Theresa, Maurizio Giuseppe Duke of Monferrat, and Giuseppe Placido, count of Moriana.\nIn this period, Charles Felix began to keep a personal diary, which is an important source for events and his conflicts with the court in Savoy.\nItalian campaign (1792\u20131798).\nWhen war broke out with France, Charles Felix did not distinguish himself as a soldier, despite having received a military education. In 1792, after the French occupation of the Duchy of Savoy and the county of Nice, he followed the troops to Saluzzo and in 1793, he accompanied his father, Victor Amadeus III, who had directed the operations for the reconquest of Nice and Savoy along with the Austrians under general J. de Vins, into the Susa Valley, to Pinerolo, Cuneo, and Tende.\nCharles Felix remained very far from the front lines in any case. In spring 1794, after the arrival in Aosta of his brother the Duke of Monferrat, Charles Felix and Giuseppe Placido went to Morgex in order to retake some positions of relative strategic importance, but they did not achieve anything.\nOn 28 April 1796, Victor Amadeus III was forced to sign the Armistice of Cherasco with the French, which was followed by the Treaty of Paris on 15 May, which accepted French control of Nice, Savoy, Genevoise, and some fortresses. Charles Felix, who had been titled Duke of Genoa, obtained the title of Marquis of Susa in compensation for his nominal loss.\nVictor Amadeus III died in October of the same year and was succeeded as Prince of Piedmont by Charles Emmanuel IV. The relationship between the new king and Charles Felix had never been good but now deteriorated as the king strove to keep his brothers in the dark about affairs of the state.\nTwo years into his reign, Charles Emmanuel IV was forced to surrender all royal control on the mainland. Along with the king and the rest of the royal family, Charles Felix left Turin on the evening of 9 December 1798 for Cagliari, where they arrived on 3 March 1799.\nViceroy of Sardinia (1799\u20131814).\nCharles Emmanuel IV was childless and, after the death of his wife, he abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I on 4 June 1802. The latter did not take possession of the domains in Sardinia himself, preferring to entrust them to Charles Felix as viceroy.\nCharles Felix's government of Sardinia was rather rigid and authoritarian. Since the Sardinian revolutionary movements in 1794, the island had experienced a period of disorder, exacerbated by widespread poverty, which had led to an increase in crime, which the viceroy suppressed with notable harshness, writing to his brother the king, \"slaughter, slaughter, for the good of the human race.\"\nCharles Felix established a military regime, such that his Sardinian subjects referred to him as \"Carlo Feroce\" (Charles the Ferocious). The tool of this regime was the special court of the Viceregal delegation for the investigation of political proceedings, which took action immediately against the \"capopolo\" (popular leader), Vincenzo Sulis, who was guilty of nothing other than having been more successful than the viceroy in defeating the revolutionary movements. When Sulis was condemned to twenty years in jail, the viceroy considered it a lenient sentence. Furthermore, in the persecution of \"state criminals,\" Charles Felix legitimated the adoption of military procedures and granted every power to the police, from spying to censoring letters and placing bounties on suspects.\nIn his reorganisation work, however, he displayed notable energy to control the autonomy of the judiciary and the local bureaucracy and managed to correct some abuses of the feudal regime.\nIn fact, when the Stamenti, the parliament of the kingdom, voted to pay a tax of 400,000 lire, Charles Felix exerted significant pressure to have the poorest classes exempted from the tax and he judged disputes in feudal jurisdiction in favour of vassals rather than feudal lords. When an anti-feudal revolt took place against the Duke of Asinara, who had refused to conform to the regulations of the viceroy, Charles Felix decided to punish both the duke, who was stripped of his property, as well as the revolutionaries.\nDespite the precarious political and social situation, Charles Felix was able to bring some improvements to the agriculture and economy of the island. Under his rule, an agrarian society and an office for the administration of Crown mines and forests were established. Additionally, the farming of olives was encouraged and commercial contracts were granted to encourage local production. Finally, he began a project to systematise the road network.\nMarriage and return to Turin (1814\u20131821).\nOn 7 March 1807, in the Cappella Palatina of the Palazzo dei Normanni in Palermo, Charles Felix married by proxy Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily (17 January 1779 \u2013 11 March 1849), daughter of Ferdinand IV King of Naples and Sicily and Maria Carolina of Austria.\nThe marriage, which had originally been opposed by Charles Felix, had been arranged for dynastic reasons. Neither Charles Emmanuel nor Victor Emmanuel had male children (the son of the latter had become sick and died in Sardinia), while the Duke of Montferrat and the Count of Morian were deceased, so Charles Felix had become the heir presumptive and therefore had to produce a male heir.\nAlthough the marriage to Maria Cristina proved harmonious, she was unable to have children, forcing Victor Emmanuel to consider the succession of Charles Albert, Prince of Carignano, from a collateral line of the House of Savoy.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon and the return of Victor Emmanuel to Turin on 20 May 1814, Charles Felix joined him for a brief period before returning to Sardinia the following year with his wife. He formally retained the role of Viceroy until 1821, although he returned to the court in Turin after a short period.\nRevolution of 1821.\nOrigin.\nFollowing revolts in C\u00e1diz in 1820, King Ferdinand VII of Spain was forced to restore the Spanish Constitution of 1812 and the hope of obtaining similar concessions from their own sovereigns arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo.\nThe initial indications of the crisis were confirmed on 11 January 1821 when four students were stopped by the police at a theatre performance in Turin because they were wearing red caps with black bows, a symbol of the carboneria. The young men offered resistance and were arrested, provoking a large brawl.\nThe next day, all the students and many of their teachers protested, calling for the release of the youths and, when this was refused, they blockaded themselves in the university and the government was forced to call in the army. Although nobody was killed, the wounded were very numerous and the situation escalated.\nA connection was made between the protestors and the secret society of the \"Federati\", whose leaders Santorre di Rossi, Giacinto Collegno, Carlo Emanuele Asinari, and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi (all soldiers, officials, or sons of ministers) and Roberto d'Azeglio met with Charles Albert on 6 March. They were ready to act, having identified the prince as a new man for the House of Savoy, who might be willing to break with the absolutist past.\nThe goal of the conspirators was not to abolish the House of Savoy, but to induce it to enact political and social reforms and then undertake a war against Austria, which seemed possible in light of the deeply anti-Austrian sentiments of the Victor Emmanuel I.\nIn this, the conspirators took advantage of the absence of Charles Felix, who they thought would have been able to induce Victor Emmanuel to oppose their plans. They planned to raise the army, surround the royal residence at Moncalieri castle and force him to grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. The role of Charles Albert would have been to mediate between the conspirators and the king, but the following morning, he changed his mind and attempted to escape from the conspirators, although he did not disavow them.\nBeginning of the revolt.\nThe conspirators grew suspicious and prepared to cancel the insurrection which they had planned for the 10th. The same day, Charles Albert, completely penitent, raced to Moncalieri in order to confess everything to Victor Emmanuel and beg for pardon. In the night the garrison of Alessandria, commanded by one of the conspirators, Guglielmo Ansaldi, rebelled and occupied the city. Although they had been abandoned by the Prince, the rest of the revolutionaries decided to act at this point.\nAbdication of Victor Emmanuel and regency of Charles Albert.\nOn Sunday 11 March 1821, King Victor Emmanuel I met with the Crown Council, of which Charles Albert was a member. As a result of the king's indecision, no action was taken.\nOn 12 March, the Citadel of Turin fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel encouraged Charles Albert and Cesare Balbo to negotiate with the Carbonari, who refused to listen to their messages. Thus, in the evening, in the face of the spreading military uprising, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in Modena at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.\nThe abdication of the king, which followed the dismissal of the ministers of state, led to chaos because it created a dynastic crisis which foreign powers would not ignore and because it split the army and bureaucracy, preventing every possibility of maintaining order.\nThe regent tried to take control by naming a new government (the lawyer, Ferdinando del Pozzo (1768\u20131843) as Minister of the Interior, general Emanuele Pes di Villamarina as minister of war, and Lodovico Sauli d'Igliano as minister of foreign affairs) and attempted to negotiate with the rebels, but he achieved nothing.\nGiven the impossibility of taking any decisions without the agreement of the new king, Charles Albert sent Charles Felix an account of the events, seeking instructions, but the letter took a very long time to reach its destination.\nFearful of becoming the object of popular anger, on the evening of 13 March 1821, Charles Albert signed a decree granting a constitution along the lines of the Spanish constitution of 1812, which would not become law until approved by the king.\nThe next day, the regent decided to form a junta, which was to protect the parliament. Two days after that, he swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, in a Savoyard version which had been slightly altered according to the requests of Victor Emmanuel's consort, Maria Therese.\nIntervention of Charles Felix.\nAt this point, Charles Felix, who had now received the letter from Charles Albert notifying him of his brother's abdication, decided to act. He told the messenger not to address him as \"majesty\", then asserted that since the abdication had been extracted through violence, it could not be considered valid. Finally, he said, \"tell the Prince that, if there is still a drop of our royal blood in his veins, he should set out for Novara immediately and wait there for my orders.\"\nAs for the Spanish constitution, he declared any sovereign acts taken after the abdication of his brother to be null and void, and then he issued the following proclamation, \"Far from consenting to any change in the pre-existing form of government with the nominal abdication of the king, our beloved brother, we consider all the royal subjects who have aided or abetted the traitors or who have presumed to proclaim a constitution, to be rebels.\"\nCharles Albert, deeply discouraged, did as Charles Felix commanded, went to Novara, and issued a proclamation renouncing the regency and calling on everyone to submit to Charles Felix. On the 29th, he received a letter from Charles Felix ordering him to depart with his family for Florence.\nWith Charles Albert out of the way, Charles Felix dispatched several letters to Francis I of Austria, asking him to send troops in order to suppress the revolt.\nOn 3 April, he issued a second proclamation which granted a pardon to the soldiers while applying strict sanctions to rebel officials, which ultimately, prevented any form of compromise. Chancellor Metternich himself said to Francis IV of Modena that this proclamation had been imprudent and was written \"with animosity, passion, and hatred.\"\nThe rebels, realising that no other option remained for them, marched on Novara, where the forces loyal to Charles Felix were gathered under the command of Vittorio Sallier de La Tour. This, inevitably, convinced Metternich to intervene.\nOn 8 April there was a battle (Noara-Borgo Vercelli) with the troops of de La Tour and then with those of the Austrian general Ferdinand von Bubna, who occupied Vercelli and Alessandria on 11 April, while de La Tour, who had received full powers from Charles Felix, occupied Turin on the 10th.\nOn 19 April, despite pressure from the emperors of Russia and Austria, Metternich, Charles Albert, Francis IV, and Charles Felix himself (who hated the idea of receiving the crown \"thanks\" to rebels), Victor Emmanuel reaffirmed his abdication. Thus, on 25 April, Charles Felix acceded to the throne.\nSuppression.\nOnce control of Turin was re-established, Charles Felix, who was still in Modena, entered into personal communication with the Emperor of Austria in order to obtain recognition from the Congress of Laibach, which was then in session, that he would be able to assume full control of his possessions, as an absolute monarch, and that Austria would not be allowed to interfere in any way in his territories.\nAt the subsequent Congress of Verona, Charles Felix feared pressure for constitutional changes and reiterated in his instructions to his ambassadors that the repression of the \"revolutionary spirit\" inspired by the Congress of Laibach belonged exclusively to him and that he was firmly convinced of the necessity of this obligation.\nHaving decided to remain at Modena, he appointed Ignazio Thaon di Revel as Lieutenant General of the Kingdom, and placed G. Piccono della Valle and G.C. Brignole in charge of foreign affairs and financial affairs respectively.\nFinally, he began the suppression of opposition. The following extract from the work of Guido Astuti describes his actions:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The new king, Charles Felix, let loose a reaction with arbitrary repressive methods, using extraordinary commissions to judge the rebels and establishing political investigators in order to purge the army and the bureaucracy\u2014\u200a\nFinally, the king instituted three different jurisdictions: a mixed civil and military tribunal called the Royal Delegation with penal powers, a military commission for investigating the conduct of officers and non-commissioned officers, and a scrutiny commission for investigating the conduct of every employee of the kingdom.\nThe Royal Delegation sat from 7 May to early October, in which time it issued 71 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and 20 sentences of imprisonment for 5 to 20 years. After the delegation's dissolution, the senate issued a further 24 death sentences, 5 sentences of life imprisonment, and another 12 sentences of imprisonment for 15\u201320 years. By the end of October the military commission had dismissed 627 officers.\nThe scrutiny commission, divided into a superior tribunal and seven divisional boards of scrutiny, issued numerous dismissals and suspensions of civil servants and professors of every kind of school, whom it found particularly culpable.\nOn the instructions of the minister of the interior, Roget de Cholex, the University of Turin was closed and many professors received severe admonitions because, as the king wrote in a letter to his brother (9 May 1822): \"everyone who has studied at the university is entirely corrupt: the professors are detestable, but there is no way to replace them... Thus the bad are all taught and the good are all ignorant.\".\nIn any case, although an oppressive climate was established, accompanied by the habituation to accusations and the diversity of political ideas, offering a pretext for pursuing private vendettas, the royal authority, especially the governor of Genoa, Giorgio Des Geneys, did not prevent people from fleeing. Of all the people who were condemned, only two were executed.\nFurther, it is reported by a letter of the Count d'Agli\u00e8 that Charles Felix never prevented anyone from secretly passing subsidies to condemned men who had gone into exile and Angelo Brofferio reports that when the king discovered that one of these subsidies was going to the family of one of the two individuals who had been executed in 1821, the king doubled the sum.\nThe suppression of opposition was terminated on 30 September 1821, when Charles Felix issued a pardon of all individuals who had been implicated in the revolt, excluding the leaders, the financiers and those who had been found guilty of homicide or extortion. A few days later, Charles Felix entered Turin.\nReign (1821\u20131831).\nEven before he reached Turin, Charles Felix repudiated the Regent's promise and, to help restore order, he called in the Austrians, who stayed in Piedmont till 1823. In that same year, Charles Albert went to Spain to extinguish by force of arms the last sparks of revolt, making himself an object of hatred as the betrayer of Italian liberalism, but regaining the confidence of the King, who might have chosen another successor.\nCharles Felix was a true reactionary, convinced that the world would soon be swept clean of all those - in his view - wicked and sacrilegious innovations introduced by the French Revolution and diffused throughout Europe by Napoleon Bonaparte \"the rascal\" as he called him.\nInternal policy.\nCharles Felix was rarely present in Turin as king and did not participate in the social life of the capital, since he had never sought the throne and had no particular affection for the Turinese, whom he considered to have proven themselves traitors to the dynasty through their support for Napoleon and the constitutional protests.\nIn practice, he resided in Turin only during the theatre season and he spent the rest of the time travelling around Savoy, Nice, Genoa (one of his favourite residences) and the castles of Govone and Agli\u00e8, which he had inherited from his sister Maria Anna.\nAs a result, the king tended to delegate large amounts of power to his ministers, especially Count Roget de Cholex, Minister of the Interior, reserving a supervisory role for himself. His government was characterised by Massimo d'Azeglio as follows:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A despotism full of straight and honest intentions but its representatives and arbiters were four old chamberlains, four old maids of honour, with a hive of friars, priests, monks, and jesuits.\u2014\u200a\nNevertheless, the king was not entirely unaware of the need for reform and certainly exerted himself in the defense of the Piedmontese realm from Pontifical and foreign intervention. He limited the privileges and exemptions of the church, which seemed harmful to the state, almost completely abolished the right of sanctuary in holy places, granted secular courts the right to hear cases against priests, and imposed civic oversight of catechisms, sermons, and religious books.\nRegarding the issue of church property which had been secularised in 1792 (with Papal consent) and Franciscan property which had been secularised unilaterally, the king appointed an extraordinary board composed of officials and supporters of the clergy. The proposals, delivered to Pope Leo XII by ambassador-extraordinary Filiberto Avogadro di Collobiano in December 1827, were examined by a council of cardinals, who rejected some financial details and the right of the state to dispose of the property freely. However, on 1 April 1828, the king summoned a new council, to which he professed flexibility on the financial issues and rigidity on the issue of disposal. The resulting agreement was approved on 14 May 1828 by the Holy See.\nThere were also important legislative reforms, which were effected by the Edict of 16 July 1822, which reformed mortgages; the Edict of 27 August 1822, which unified the military penal law; and the Edict of 27 September 1822, which reformed the judicial system. These changes were capped by the \"Civil and Criminal Laws of the Kingdom of Sardinia\", signed on 16 January 1827, which replaced the dated Carta de Logu.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Charles Felix, like every man of the Restoration, which simultaneously included both reactionaries and reformers, had had a great variety of experiences and appeared to oscillate between the open revival of eighteenth-century despotism, which had come to an end with the Napoleonic state, and historic innovations, which had little luck in Italy, however... On the one hand there was a typical effort to update dynastic absolutism, on the other hand there was substantial adoption of the French system - with exceptions and modifications.\u2014\u200a\nIn fact, while Victor Emmanuel had implemented a rigid counter-revolution, which uncritically revoked every arrangement made by the French after the abdication of Charles Emmanuel IV, the state could not continue to ignore the will of the majority of its subjects who called for laws in accordance with the ideas and needs of their contemporary world. Some reforms to fill the gaps were necessary.\nThus, on 27 September 1822, after Charles Felix had re-established the publication of mortgages and codified the military penal law, he promulgated an Edict on the reform of the civil judicial system - excluding Sardinia.\nThe edict abolished a majority of the special jurisdictions (e.g. for gambling offences, or management of ports), instituted 40 collegial prefecture tribunals (which managed 416 \"district courts\"), with original jurisdiction, which were divided into four classes, according to the importance of the area, and he entrusted instruction of the procedures to special members of these tribunals. Civil and penal jurisdiction remained with the Senate in Turin and fiscal jurisdiction with the Court of Audit.\nIn addition, a single appellate jurisdiction was introduced, eliminating the multiplicity of appeals that had previously existed and the ministerial position of fiscal advocate was introduced.\nFinally, he made the act of taking a case to court free, however inadequately, replacing the old system of the \"sportula\", which was a very heavy judicial fee, calculated on the basis of the seriousness of the case, which provided the judges' pay, with a regular system of salaries paid by the state.\nAnother important change was the code of civil and criminal law of the Kingdom of Sardinia promulgated on 16 January 1827, mainly as a result of the work of the Count of Cholex. The code was prepared in Turin by the Supreme Council of Sardinia. It was then examined by an appropriate Sardinian committee and the Reale Udienza of Sardinia. The result was a confection of Sardinian and mainland sources, creating a law which was both traditional and novel.\nThe most novel changes relate to penal law: the abolition of the \"giudatico\" (impunity for criminals who had arrested other criminals) and the \"esemplarit\u00e0\" (cruel extensions of the death penalty, like quartering the corpse and scattering the ashes); restrictions on the imposition of the death penalty; affirmation of the principle that the punishment should fit the crime; and the distinction between attempted crimes and crimes actually committed.\nFinally, the slave trade was abolished and it was declared that any person who was found in captivity on a ship flying the Sardinian flag would instantly be freed.\nEconomic initiatives.\nCharles Felix's reign was characterised by financial and economic difficulties and rigid protectionism, but there were some initiatives relating to services and public works.\nThe road network was improved by the construction of the road between Cagliari and Sassari (now Strada statale 131 Charles Felix) and between Genoa and Nice, as well as bridges over the Bormida and the Ticino (the latter completed in 1828). A large number of public buildings were constructed in the cities: the port of Nice was largely restored, Genoa received a theatre (the Teatro Carlo Felice, named after the king), and Turin benefited from a programme of urban improvement which included the bridge over the Dora, the Piazza Carlo Felice, underground drainage channels, the porticos of the Piazza Castello and various new suburbs.\nCharles Felix paid attention to the steelworking sector, which had already occupied him as Viceroy, as well as the banking and insurance sectors, which were improved significantly by the creation of the Cassa di Risparmio di Torino in 1827 and the establishment of the Royal Mutual Society of Insurers in June 1829. He also encouraged the agricultural and manufacturing sector by granting many exemptions and fiscal benefits and through the creation of trade fairs like that of 1829, in which 500 exhibitors participated.\nForeign policy.\nTheoretically, Charles Felix was committed to the territorial expansion of his realm, but he did not maintain any expansionist illusions and preferred to concentrate on the economic and commercial interests of his realm. Thus in 1821, with the help of the Austrians and English, he signed an advantageous trade agreement with the Sublime Porte.\nIn September 1825, in order to force the Bey of Tripoli to observe the treaty established with him in 1816 under English auspices, and to respect Sardinian ships sailing along the coast of North Africa, he launched a demonstration of force. Towards the end of the month, two frigates (\"Commercio\" and \"Cristina\"), a corvette (\"Tritone\") and a brig (\"Nereide\") under the command of captain Francesco Sivori, appeared off the coast of Tripoli. After a final attempt to pressure the Bey diplomatically, ten Sardinian longboats sailed into the harbour on the night of 27 September and set fire to a Tripolitanian brig and two schooners, routing or killing the Tripolitanian troops. This forced the Bey to take a more conciliatory approach.\nIn 1828, he ended the construction of a bridge over the River Ticino at Boffalora, which had been begun by his brother Victor Emmanuel I some years earlier as a result of a treaty with the Emperor of Austria, who controlled the other side of the river as part of the Kingdom of Lombardy\u2013Venetia.\nPatronage.\nCharles Felix was an avid patron of art and culture. In 1824, he acquired Hautecombe Abbey, where many of his ancestors were buried and entrusted a restoration programme to the architect Ernesto Melano.\nIn the same year, he was responsible for the acquisition of a good part of the collection which now constitutes the Museo Egizio in Turin. The pieces were acquired from Bernardino Drovetti, a native of Barbania, who was then the French consul in Egypt. The collection was placed in the Palazzo dell'Accademia delle Scienze, which is still the site of the museum.\nIn 1827, Charles Felix instituted the Chamber of Commerce and the School of Palaeography and Diplomacy, affiliated with the Academy of Painting and Sculpture.\nDeath and succession.\nCharles Felix died without issue on 27 April 1831, in Turin at the Palazzo Chablais which had been given to him by his sister Princess Maria Anna, Duchess of Chablais, after a reign of ten years. He was buried at Hautecombe Abbey in Savoy, where his wife was also buried in 1849. With his death, the main line of the House of Savoy became extinct. He was succeeded by the senior male member of the House of Savoy-Carignano, the regent Charles Albert (1798\u20131849). The selection of Charles Albert as successor had not been made willingly, since Charles Albert had shown himself to be inclined to liberalism and friendly to the carbonari.\nLegacy.\nThe Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa is named for him. The principal road of the island of Sardinia, the Strada statale 131 Carlo Felice, which connects the towns of Cagliari and Sassari-Porto Torres, constructed in the 19th century, is named for him. At the Cagliari end of that road there is a statue of him, pointing to the city. It is the typical prop for the celebrations of Cagliari Calcio fans, being decked with cloaks and flags in the team's colours of red and blue whenever the team is promoted or escapes relegation.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The pools were fed by the waters of the Gihon Spring, carried there by the Siloam tunnel.\nThe Lower Pool or \"Old Pool\" (, according to Isaiah 22:11) was historically known in Palestinian Arabic as Birket el-\u1e25amra \"the Red Pool.\"\nHistory.\nDuring the Second Temple period, the Pool of Siloam was centrally located in the Jerusalem suburb of Acra (), also known as the Lower City.\nToday, the Pool of Siloam is the lowest place in altitude within the historical city of Jerusalem, with an elevation of about above sea level. The ascent from it unto the Temple Mount meant a gradient of in altitude at a linear distance of about , with a mean elevation in the Temple Mount of above sea level. According to the Jerusalem Talmud, Hagigah, the Pool of Siloam was the starting point for pilgrims who made the annual pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and where they ascended by foot to the inner court of the Temple Mount to bring an offertory to the Temple Court. The Pool of Siloam (perhaps referring to the Lower Pool) was used by pilgrims for ritual purification before visiting the Temple enclosure.\nHezekiah.\nThe Pool of Siloam was built during the reign of Hezekiah (715\u2013687/6 BCE) to leave besieging armies without access to the spring's waters. The newly constructed Siloam tunnel fed the pool. An older Canaanite tunnel had been vulnerable to attackers, so, under threat from the Assyrian king Sennacherib, Hezekiah sealed the old outlet of the Gihon Spring and built the new underground Siloam tunnel in place of the older tunnel (Books of Chronicles, ).\nDuring this period the Pool of Siloam was sometimes known as the Lower Pool according to Isaiah 22:9, as opposed to the more ancient Upper Pool mentioned in 2 Kings 18:17 and formerly fed by the older Canaanite tunnel.\nSecond Temple period.\nThe pool was reconstructed no earlier than the reign of Alexander Jannaeus (103\u201376 BCE), although it is not clear whether this pool was in the same location as the earlier pool built by Hezekiah \u2013 if so, all traces of the earlier construction have been destroyed. The pool remained in use during the time of Jesus. According to the John 9, Jesus sent a man blind from birth to the pool to complete his healing. As a freshwater reservoir, the pool would have been a major gathering place for ancient Jews making religious pilgrimages to the city. Some scholars, influenced by Jesus commanding the blind man to wash in the pool, suggest that it was probably used as a mikvah (ritual bath).\nThe pool was destroyed and covered after the First Jewish\u2013Roman War in 70 CE. Dating was indicated by several coins discovered on the stones of the patio near the pool to the north from the days of the War. The latest coin is dated \"4 years to the day of the Great Revolt, \" meaning 69 CE. In the years following the destruction, winter rains washed alluvia from the hills to the valley and down the slopes of Mount Zion to the west of the pool; the pool was filled with silt layers (up to 4m in some places) until it was covered completely.\nLate Roman and Byzantine periods.\nRoman sources mention a \"Shrine of the Four Nymphs\" (\"Tetranymphon\"), a nymphaeum built by Hadrian during the construction of Aelia Capitolina in the year 135 and mentioned in Byzantine works such as the 7th-century \"Chronicon Paschale\"; other nymphaea built by Hadrian, such as that at Sagalassos, are very similar. It is unlikely that this shrine was built on the site of the Second Temple Pool of Siloam, but it may have been a precursor to the Byzantine reconstruction.\nIn the 5th century, a pool was constructed at the end of the Siloam tunnel at the behest of Aelia Eudocia, empress consort of the Byzantine Empire. This pool survives today, surrounded by a high stone wall with an arched entrance to Hezekiah's Tunnel. The pool is around from the Second Temple period Lower Pool and is significantly smaller. Until the discovery of the Second Temple pool, this pool was wrongly thought to be the one described in the New Testament and Second Temple sources.\nDiscovery in the 21st century.\nThe pool was rediscovered during an excavation work for a sewer in the autumn of 2004, by Ir David Foundation workers, following a request and directions given by archaeologists Eli Shukron accompanied by Ori Orbach from the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Shukron and Ronny Reich (working with the Israel Antiquities Authority) uncovered stone steps, and it became obvious that these steps were likely to have been part of the Second Temple period pool. Excavations commenced and confirmed the initial supposition; the find was formally announced on August 9, 2005, and received substantial international media attention.\nThe excavations also revealed that the pool was wide, and that steps existed on at least three sides of the pool. The pool is not perfectly rectangular, but a soft trapezoid. There are three sets of five steps, two leading to a platform, before the bottom is reached, and it has been suggested that the steps were designed to accommodate various water levels. The pool is stone-lined, but underneath, there is evidence of an earlier version that was merely plastered (to help it retain water). Coins from the reign of Alexander Jannaeus were found embedded in the plaster lining of the pool, and therefore provide a secure earliest date for the pool's (re-)construction.\nFor almost two decades after the initial discovery, most of the pool remained unexcavated, as the land above was owned by a nearby Greek Orthodox church until 2004 (when it was sold to a Jewish development company), and was occupied by an orchard known as the King's Garden (compare ). In late December 2022, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the eviction of the tenants and turned ownership of the plot over to the City of David Foundation. Several months later, the Israel Antiquities Authority commenced a complete excavation of this plot in hopes of uncovering the remaining portion of the pool. \nThe initial excavations surprised archaeologists by uncovering scant additional remains from the pool, but later investigations allowed for carbon dating the pool to roughly 800 BCE, at the time of King Jehoash of Judah. Those investigations indicated the pool may have been built to supply the city with water during times of climate change, and found that the pool was larger than expected at 19 m x 10 m x 11 m. In 2023, it was announced that the steps to the pool, where Jesus was said to have healed a blind man, were found.\nEarlier excavations.\nArchaeologists excavating the site around the Pool of Siloam in the 1880s have noted that there was a stairway of 34 rock-hewn steps to the west of the Pool of Siloam leading up from a court in front of the Pool of Siloam. The breadth of the steps varies from at the top to at the bottom.\nThe remnants of an ancient wall dating to the Bronze Age were unearthed near the older Pool of Siloam, known also as the \"Lower Pool,\" and locally as \"Birket al-\u1e24amrah\", during the excavations conducted by F. J. Bliss and A. C. Dickie (1894\u20131897). At the \"Lower Pool\" of Siloam there was a weir (levee), used to raise the level of water upstream or to regulate its flow. Conrad Schick's research in connection with a partially rock-hewn aqueduct related to the water system of Siloam has led researchers to conclude that the Lower Pool, \"Birket al-\u1e24amrah\", received water directly from the \"Fountain of the Virgin\" (Gihon Spring) at some period and which Schick places prior to the completion of the Siloam Tunnel.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "69577", "revid": "36336112", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69577", "title": "Charles Albert of Sardinia", "text": "King of Sardinia from 1831 to 1849\nCharles Albert (; 2 October 1798 \u2013 28 July 1849) was the King of Sardinia and ruler of the Savoyard state from 27 April 1831 until his abdication in 1849. His name is bound up with the first Italian constitution, the \"Statuto Albertino\", and with the First Italian War of Independence (1848\u20131849).\nDuring the Napoleonic period, Charles Albert resided in France, where he received a liberal education. As Prince of Carignano in 1821, he granted and then withdrew his support for a rebellion which sought to force Victor Emmanuel I to institute a constitutional monarchy. He became a conservative and participated in the legitimist expedition against the Spanish liberals in 1823 known as the \"Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis\".\nCharles Albert became king of Sardinia in 1831 on the death of his distant cousin Charles Felix, who had no heir. As king, after an initial conservative period during which he supported various European legitimist movements, he adopted the neo-Guelph idea of a federal Italy, led by the Pope and freed from the House of Habsburg in 1848. In the same year, he granted the Albertine Statute, the first Italian constitution, which remained in force until 1947.\nCharles Albert led his forces against the Imperial Austrian army in the First Italian War of Independence but was abandoned by Pope Pius IX and Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, and was defeated in 1849 at the Battle of Novara, after which he abdicated in favour of his son, Victor Emmanuel II. Charles Albert died in exile a few months later in the Portuguese city of Porto.\nThe attempt to free northern Italy from Austria represents the first attempt of the House of Savoy to alter the equilibrium established in the Italian peninsula after the Congress of Vienna. These efforts were continued successfully by his son Victor Emmanuel II, who became the first king of a unified Italy in 1861. Charles Albert received several nicknames including \"the Italian Hamlet\" (given to him by Giosu\u00e8 Carducci on account of his gloomy, hesitant, and enigmatic character), as well as \"the Hesitant King\" (\"Re Tentenna\") because he hesitated for a long time between the establishment of a constitutional monarchy and the reinforcement of absolute rule.\nEarly life and studies.\nCharles Albert was born at the Palazzo Carignano in Turin on 2 October 1798 to Charles Emmanuel, Prince of Carignano, and Maria Cristina of Saxony. His father was the great-great-great-grandson of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, youngest legitimate son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, and founder of the Carignano line of the House of Savoy. Since he did not belong to the main line of the House of Savoy his chances at birth of succeeding to the kingdom were slim. Although the reigning king, Charles Emmanuel IV, had no children, at his death the throne would pass to his brother Victor Emmanuel and then to the latter's son Charles Emmanuel. After that, in the line of succession there were two further brothers of Charles Emmanuel IV: Maurizio Giuseppe and Charles Felix. In 1799, two of these heirs died: the young Charles Emmanuel (aged only three years) and Maurizio Giuseppe (from malaria in Sardinia).\nNapoleonic period.\nCharles Albert's father, Charles Emmanuel of Carignano, had studied in France and had been an officer in the French army. Sympathetic to liberalism, he travelled to Turin in 1796, in the wake of the French invasion of 1796 and King Charles Emmanuel IV's flight into exile. There Charles Emmanuel of Carignano and his wife joined the French cause. Despite this, the pair were sent to Paris, where they were placed under surveillance and forced to live in poor conditions in a house in the suburbs. These were the circumstances in which their children, Charles Albert and his sister Maria Elisabeth (born 13 April 1800), grew up.\nOn 16 August 1800, Charles Emmanuel of Carignano died suddenly. It was up to Charles Albert's mother to deal with the French, who had no intention of recognizing her rights, titles or property. She nonetheless refused to send her son to the Savoy family in Sardinia for a conservative education. In 1810, Maria Christina married for a second time, to Giuseppe Massimiliano Thibaut di Montl\u00e9art, whose relationship with Charles Albert was poor.\nWhen he was twelve years old, Charles Albert and his mother were finally granted an audience with Napoleon, who granted the boy the title of count and an annual pension. Since it was no longer appropriate for him to be educated at home, Charles Albert was sent to the Coll\u00e8ge Stanislas in Paris in 1812. He remained at the school for two years, but did not attend regularly; instead, he attended only to sit exams, apparently with success. In the meantime, Albertina had moved to Geneva, where Charles Albert joined her from March 1812 to December 1813, and he studied with the Protestant Pastor, Jean-Pierre Etienne Vaucher (1763\u20131841), a follower of Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\nAfter Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813, the family left Geneva, fearing the arrival of Austrian forces and returned to France. At the beginning of 1814, Charles Albert enrolled in the military school in Bourges, hoping to become an officer in the French army. He was sixteen years old. Napoleon named him a lieutenant of dragoons in 1814.\nFirst period in Turin (1814\u20131821).\nAfter Napoleon was defeated for good, the new king Louis XVIII celebrated the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty in Paris on 16 May 1814. Among those present at the festivities were Princess Maria Christina di Carignano and her children Charles Albert and Elisabetta. Despite their past, the family was treated well, although Charles Albert had to renounce the title of Count of the Empire, which had been conferred upon him at the military school in Bourges and the annuity which Napoleon had granted him.\nThe re-establishment of peace in Europe meant that Charles Albert could return to Turin, and he was advised to do so by his tutor, count Alessandro Di Saluzzo di Menusiglio, and by Albertina. He left Paris (and his step-father) and arrived in Turin on 24 May. There he was welcomed affectionately by King Victor Emmanuel I (Charles Emmanuel IV had abdicated in 1802) and his wife Queen Maria Theresa, by birth a Habsburg archduchess. His property and lands were restored to him and he was granted the Palazzo Carignano as a residence. Given the dynastic situation (neither Victor Emmanuel nor his brother Charles Felix had male children) Charles Albert was now the heir presumptive.\nThus he was assigned a mentor to counter the liberal ideas that he had learned in France. The first of these was Count Filippo Grimaldi del Poggetto, and after he had failed, the dragoon, Policarpo Cacherano d'Osasco. Although he was better equipped for the task, he was not able to influence the mindset of Charles Albert, who began to suffer from anxiety at this time.\nMarriage and personality.\nThe court decided that marriage would provide the prince with internal equilibrium. The chosen bride, accepted by Charles Albert, was the sixteen-year-old daughter of Ferdinand III of Tuscany, Archduchess Maria Theresa, a relative of Queen Maria Theresa. Charles Albert travelled to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany and then to Rome on 18 March 1817 and, after a 6-month engagement, married Maria Theresa on 30 September in Florence Cathedral. The wedding was followed by a ball organized by the Sardinian embassy in Florence. After that, on 6 October, the couple departed for Piedmont. On 11 October, they reached Castello del Valentino and from there they made their formal entrance into Turin.\nThe young Maria Theresa was very shy and religious, quite different from Charles Albert's temperament. The couple resided in the Palazzo Carignano, to which Charles Albert began to invite young intellectuals with whom he shared liberal ideas. The most intimate of these friends were Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Roberto d'Azeglio, Giacinto Collegno, Cesare Balbo, Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio Gribaldi and Carlo Emanuele Asinari di San Marzano.\nIn these years, Charles Albert also suffered from a deep religious crisis. This led to a friendship with the French diplomat Jean Louis de Douhet d'Auzers and a visit by the prince to Rome in 1817 to visit the former king Charles Emmanuel IV, who had retired to a monastery. In the years following his marriage, however, Charles Albert had extramarital affairs with several women, including Marie Caroline de Bourbon, widow of the Duke of Berry. Maria Theresa had two miscarriages \u2013 the second in 1819 as a result of a carriage accident \u2013 but gave birth to a son on 14 March 1820, Victor Emmanuel, the future King of Italy.\nParticipation in the Revolution of 1821.\nAfter the 1820 uprising in C\u00e1diz, King Ferdinand VII of Spain was forced to grant the Spanish Constitution of 1812. The hope of obtaining similar constitutions arose in many European states. Insurrections broke out in Naples and Palermo. On 6 March 1821, Santorre di Rossi de Pomarolo, Giacinto Provana di Collegno, Carlo di San Marzano and Guglielmo Moffa di Lisio (all military officers, officials, or sons of ministers) and Roberto d'Azeglio met with Charles Albert. The young liberals were ready to act and had identified the prince as a new type of man for the House of Savoy \u2014 one ready to break with the absolutist past.\nThe conspirators had no desire to abolish the House of Savoy, but claimed, on the contrary, that they hoped to force it to grant reforms which would grant it the gratitude of the people. During the months of preparation, Charles Albert had assured them of his support and on 6 March he confirmed this, declaring that he supported armed action. They were to raise troops, surround King Victor Emmanuel I's residence at Moncalieri and demand that he grant a constitution and declare war on Austria. Charles Albert was to play the role of mediator between the conspirators and the king.\nOn the morning of the next day, 7 March, Charles Albert had second thoughts and informed the conspirators of this. Indeed, he summoned the Minister of War, Alessandro Di Saluzzo di Menusiglio and told him that he had discovered a revolutionary plot. There was an attempt to halt the conspiracy, which nevertheless continued to grow bolder on the next day, with another visit by di Rossi and di Marzano. Yet, they grew uncertain and gave orders to cancel the insurrection, which was due to break out on 10 March. The same day, Charles Albert, full of regret, raced to Moncalieri, where he revealed everything to Victor Emmanuel I and begged for a pardon. The situation had reached a tipping point. In the night, the garrison of Alessandria, commanded by one of the conspirators (Guglielmo Ansaldi), rose up and took control of the city. At this point, the revolutionaries decided to act, despite the abandonment of the prince.\nRegency and Spanish Constitution.\nOn 11 March 1821, Victor Emmanuel I called a meeting of the council of the Crown, in which Charles Albert also participated. Along with the majority of those who were present, Charles Albert declared his willingness to grant the constitution. Rumours spread however that armed intervention to restore order in Italy by a joint Austrian and Russian force were imminent. The king decided to wait, therefore, but the next day, the Citadel of Turin fell into the hands of the rebels. Victor Emmanuel I then asked Charles Albert and Cesare Balbo to negotiate with the Carbonari, but the latter refused any contact with the two. That evening, as the armed uprising spread, the king abdicated in favour of his brother Charles Felix. Since the latter was in Modena at the time, Charles Albert was appointed regent.\nOnly 23 years of age, Charles Albert found himself in charge of resolving a serious political crisis which he himself had been responsible for provoking. The old ministers abandoned him and he was forced to nominate a new government: the lawyer Ferdinando dal Pozzo as Minister of the Interior, the general Emanuele Pes di Villamarina as Minister of War, and Lodovico Sauli d'Igliano as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He tried to negotiate with the rebels, with no results. Terrified, he claimed that it was impossible to make any decisions without the agreement of the new king and therefore sent Charles Felix a letter with an account of the events that had taken place and a request for instructions. But he was also afraid that he would become the object of popular anger if he continued to delay and so, on 13 March 1821, Charles Albert published a proclamation conceding the Spanish Constitution, with the reservation that this grant was pending the approval of the king.\nOn 14 March, the regent decided to form a Junta which would be able to act as guardians of the parliament. The head was Canon Pier Bernardo Marentini, a Jansenist, who was Vicar-General of the Archdiocese of Turin and had been chosen as Bishop of Piacenza in 1813 but denied the role by the Pope. On 15 March, in the presence of the Junta, Charles Albert swore to observe the Spanish Constitution, which had been amended with a few clauses requested by Victor Emmanuel I's queen, Maria Theresa.\nMeanwhile, the representatives of liberals of Lombardy had arrived: Giorgio Pallavicino Trivulzio, Gaetano Castiglia, and Giuseppe Arconati Visconti. They asked Charles Albert to declare war on Austria in order to free Milan, but the prince refused. Instead, he accepted the advice of Cesare Balbo, who restored discipline within the army, stopped excesses and firmly established the troops loyal to the king. Charles Felix himself, however, had responded very badly to the news of his brother's abdication, which he considered an \"abominable act of violence\" and, from Modena, he sent an order to Charles Albert, ordering him to come to Novara, and declaring any actions taken in the name of the king after the abdication of his brother, including the concession of the Spanish Constitution, to be null and void.\nReactionary period (1821\u20131831).\nAt midnight on 21 March 1821, Charles Albert secretly departed from the Palazzo Carignano. His departure was not discovered by the revolutionaries until the next day. From Rondissone, on 23 March he made for San Germano, from which he intended to travel to Novara, which remained loyal to the king. At Novara he remained for six days before a dispatch arrived from Charles Felix on the 29th, ordering him to depart immediately for Tuscany.\nFlorence.\nOn the afternoon of 2 April 1821, the prince arrived in Florence. His wife and son, who had been in France, followed on the 13th. The Prince's father-in-law, Grand Duke Ferdinand III granted them the Palazzo Pitti as a residence. In May, Charles Felix, who had successfully secured Austrian assistance to restore order, met with Victor Emmanuel I at Lucca. The two discussed Charles Albert's conduct for a long time and, although the new queen Maria Christina spoke in his defence, they decided that he was responsible for the conspiracy.\nAs a result of this decision and the circumstances, Charles Albert decided to disavow his liberal ideas, especially as Charles Felix had entertained the idea of eliminating him from the line of succession and passing the crown straight to his son Victor Emmanuel. Charles Felix asked the opinion of Metternich on this, who was unexpectedly opposed to the idea.\nOn 16 September 1822, the infant Victor Emmanuel barely escaped from a fire in his cot, exposing the tenuous nature of the line of succession, which was taken out of danger by the birth of a second son, Ferdinand, on 15 November. In Florence, Charles Albert cultivated various cultural interests. He became a collector of old books, but was also interested in contemporary authors, acquiring the poetry of Alphonse de Lamartine and the conservative Joseph de Maistre.\nSpanish Expedition.\nAt the beginning of 1823, Duke Louis Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame assumed command of the French expeditionary force which the European powers had entrusted with the task of suppressing the liberal revolution in Spain and restoring King Ferdinand VII to the Spanish throne after he had been captured by Spanish revolutionaries in C\u00e1diz. Charles Albert wished to demonstrate his penitence and therefore asked to be part of the contingent. He wrote to Charles Felix on this subject for the first time on 20 February 1823, but only received permission to depart on 26 April.\nOn 2 May, Charles Albert embarked on the Sardinian frigate \"Commercio\" at Livorno, which arrived in Marseille on 7 May. The next day, Charles Albert set out, arriving in Boceguillas on the 18th. By the time he arrived there, he had been assigned to the division of the French General \u00c9tienne de Bordesoulle. on the 24th, he arrived at Madrid, where he remained until 2 June, and then he set out for the south. At a clash with the enemy during the crossing of the Sierra Morena, he demonstrated courage and the French made him a member of the Legion of Honour. He proceeded to C\u00f3rdoba, Utrera, Jerez de los Caballeros and El Puerto de Santa Mar\u00eda, where he waited for the order to attack the fortress of C\u00e1diz, the Trocadero, which was the last remaining refuge of the Spanish constitutional government.\nAt the end of August 1823, with the French fleet aiding from the sea, the troops launched an assault on the Trocadero. Charles Albert fought at the head of the troops crossing the canal\u2014the sole point of entry to the fortress. He plunged into the water holding the flag of the 6th regiment of the royal guards, forded the canal and leapt into the enemy trenches. He sought to prevent the enemy prisoners from being killed, and the French soldiers gave him the epaulettes of an officer killed in the assault, so that he might be distinguished from a regular grenadier.\nCharles Albert remained at his post until nightfall, and the next day he was among the first to break into Trocadero. King Ferdinand VII and queen Maria Josepha, his cousin, were freed and embraced him in joy at seeing him. On 2 September there was a grand military parade, after which the Duc d'Angoul\u00eame decorated Charles Albert with the Cross of the Order of Saint Louis.\nVisit to Paris and return to Turin.\nWith the dissolution of the expeditionary force, Charles Albert travelled from Seville to Paris, arriving on 3 December 1823. In the French capital, he participated in balls, receptions, and parties, and developed a close relationship with Marie Caroline, widow of the Duc de Berry. On 15 December, King Louis XVIII held a grand reception for the victors of Trocadero, at which Charles Albert was among the guests of honour.\nKing Charles Felix of Sardinia decided that, as a result of his success, it was time for Charles Albert to return to Turin. The prince was required to swear \"to respect and religiously maintain all the fundamental laws of the monarchy when I ascend to power, which have led to fortune and glory over the centuries.\" On 29 January 1824, Charles Albert received permission to depart for Turin. At a final meeting with Louis XVIII, he received some advice on rulership and was enrolled in the Order of the Holy Spirit, the most prestigious chivalrous order of the French monarchy.\nOn 2 February, Charles Albert departed and on the 6th he reached Mont Cenis, where he received orders to enter Turin by night, in order to avoid protests. Charles Albert did so, probably on the 23rd. Once he had returned to Turin, Charles Albert resided mainly at Racconigi Castle, where he began preparations for reigning. He began to study a subject which received little attention at court \u2013 the economy \u2013 and in 1829 he received permission to visit Sardinia. As a result of this visit, he gained an accurate understanding of the conditions on the island. He was a prolific writer. In 1827, along with his wife, he wrote 38 fairy tales for their children in French, the language which the family used at home, entitled \"Contes moraux\" (\"Moral Tales\"). The next year, he tried his hand at comedy and after that, he occupied himself with literary criticism and history. He would publish three works: \"Notes on the Waldensians\", \"Records of Andalusia\" and \"Voyage to Sardinia\". Charles Albert regretted all of these and subsequently ordered them to be withdrawn from circulation. He also wrote a great volume of letters and literary exercises.\nDespite the conservative attitudes of the period, Charles Albert supported literati who held liberal ideas, such as Carlo Giuseppe Guglielmo Botta, whose books were banned in Piedmont. He owned the works of Adam Smith and the \"Collection of Classic Italian Writers on Political Economy\", edited by Pietro Custodi, a supporter of Napoleon.\nAccession to the throne.\nIn 1830, Charles Felix became very ill. He summoned Charles Albert to his sick bed on 24 April 1831. The entire government was present in the room as the king said to the ministers, \"Behold my heir and successor, I am sure that he will act for the good of his subjects\".\nCharles Felix died on 27 April at 2:45 pm. Charles Albert closed the corpse's eyes, kissed its hand and then assumed the throne. He received the dignitaries of court and brought his sons into the Royal Palace. At 5:00 pm, the troops rendered their oaths to the new king at the direction of Governor Ignazio Thaon di Revel, who published the proclamation relating to this. Thus the throne passed to the House of Carignano and the direct line of Savoy came to an end.\nPro-Austrian period (1831\u20131845).\nThus Charles Albert came to the throne aged 33. His health was poor; he had liver disease. His faith added to his suffering; he wore a cilice and slept alone on an iron bed, waking at 5:00 am every morning and celebrating two masses per day. He worked from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm every day without interruption. He ate little and suffered from frequent religious crises, but never renounced extramarital affairs even so. The most significant of these was his relationship with Maria Antonietta di Robilant (1804\u20131882), daughter of Friedrich Truchsess zu Waldburg (1776\u20131844), the Prussian ambassador to Turin and wife of Maurizio di Robilant (1798\u20131862).\nConflict with Louis Philippe's France.\nThe new king was affected by the July Revolution, which had deposed Charles X of France and led to the accession of Louis Philippe, an ex-revolutionary, and as a result, he decided to make an alliance with the Austrian Empire. The treaty, signed on 23 July 1831 and ratified in 1836, entrusted the defence of the Kingdom of Sardinia to Austria. However, in the event of war, the commander of the joint forces was to be Charles Albert. He wrote to the Austrian ambassador, Ludwig Senfft von Pilsach (1774\u20131853), \"... the most beautiful day of my life will be the day on which there is war with France and I have the good fortune to serve in the Austrian army.\"\nIn accordance with this legitimist position, Charles Albert lent support to his close friend Marie-Caroline de Bourbon-Sicile, duchesse de Berry in December 1823 when she sought to place her son, Henri, on the French throne. She was the widow of the Duc de Berry, second son of Charles X, whose eldest son, Louis Antoine had renounced the throne. Henri's claim to the throne had been denied by the king.\nDespite the advice of the French ambassador to exercise prudence, in 1832, Charles Albert loaned Marie-Caroline a million francs and placed a steamer at her disposal for transporting legitimist volunteers to France. The plot was discovered and failed; the steamer was stopped at Marseille and the volunteers were defeated at Vend\u00e9e in a few hours. Marie-Caroline fled, but was soon arrested in Nantes and imprisoned in the Citadel of Blaye, near Bordeaux.\nPhilosophy of rule.\nCharles Albert displayed similar conservativism in internal politics. When the minister of war, Matteo Agn\u00e8s Des Geneys (1763\u20131831) died, he replaced him with Carlo San Martino d'Aglie, who was not very popular at the time. He retained Vittorio Amedeo Sallier della Torre as Minister of Foreign Affairs until 1835, when he replaced him with the extremely conservative Clemente Solaro. These appointments were made with the intent of restoring a ministerial oligarchy. In 1831 he appointed Gaudenzio Maria Caccia, Count of Romentino (1765\u20131834) as minister of Finance, Giuseppe Barbaroux as Minister of Justice, and the reformer, Antonio Tonduti, Count of Escar\u00e8na (1771\u20131856), as minister of the Interior. On 5 April 1832, d'Aglie was replaced as Minister of War by Emanuele Pes di Villamarina.\nIn June 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was in exile in Marseille, addressed a letter to Charles Albert as \"an Italian,\" in which he encouraged him to focus on the unification of Italy, in vain. For the moment, the new King of Sardinia cleaved to almost the same ideas as his predecessors.\nReforms and cultural initiatives.\nNotwithstanding this conservatism, Charles Albert established a Council of State of 14 members who were to investigate the laws and make some moves to modernize the country. He abrogated the special exemptions on import duty for members of the royal family and royal officials, abolished torture, prohibited the mutilation of the corpses of executed criminals and the confiscation of the property of criminals. He also gave notable attention to culture. In 1832, he established the \"Pinacoteca Regia e della Galleria Reale\" in the Palazzo Madama (now the Turin City Museum of Ancient Art) and the library of the Palazzo Reale, he built several monuments and palaces, refounded the Academy of Art as the Accademia Albertina in 1833 and established the \"Royal Foundation for the Study of the History of the Fatherland\", which would become the model for all the similar foundations for historical studies established in the nineteenth century, in the same year.\nCharles Albert accompanied these measures with an economic policy of liberalization of commerce. In 1834, the tax on grain was reduced and the next year, the export of raw silk was made legal. Duties on the import of raw materials (coal, metals, textiles) were subsequently reduced and the acquisition of industrial machinery from abroad was supported. Despite having impinged on some minor sources of state income, the balance of the kingdom was positive from 1835, and it was possible to entertain ambitions for the improvement of agriculture, roads, railroads, and ports.\nCharles Albert also reformed the army, reformed the law codes, instituted a Court of cassation, and eliminated feudalism in Sardinia, in 1838. He enabled the opening of institutes of credit, reformed the public agencies and the state, and reduced the control of the religious hierarchy somewhat. The royal court was full of clerics\u2014at least fifty of them\u2014and the court was sumptuous for such a small kingdom. There were a great number of cooks, butlers, waiters, carpenters, squires, stallers, pages, footmen, masters of ceremonies, etc.\nSupport for Spanish and Portuguese reactionaries.\nAfter the death of king Ferdinand VII of Spain, the nation was divided into two factions: the anti-liberal reactionaries who supported the legitimist aspirations of Don Carlos and the constitutionalists who defended Maria Christina's regency on behalf of Isabella II. The Holy Alliance of Russia, Austria, and Prussia supported Don Carlos; Great Britain, France and Portugal supported the constitutionalists. Charles Albert sides with the former group, but in the Carlist War of 1833\u20131840, the constitutionalists prevailed. Similarly, in the Portuguese Liberal Wars (1828\u20131834), which followed the death of John VI, Charles Albert sided with the absolutists under Dom Miguel, who spent time in Piedmont. In this case, too, the liberals, led by Dom Miguel's brother Dom Pedro, enjoyed the support of Great Britain and Louis-Philippe's France and were ultimately successful.\nOpposition to \"Young Italy\".\nAt the time of Charles Albert's ascent to the throne in 1831, there were riots in Rome, the carbonari revolt of Ciro Menotti in Modena, and an insurrection in Bologna and Parma which led to the flight of Francis IV and Marie Louise. Austria was able to restore order and Charles Albert decided that his alliance with the Habsburgs was essential. The Kingdom of Sardinia was also troubled by the plots of revolutionaries in these years, and even by an attempted invasion. In April 1833, in Genoa, two low-ranking officers were arrested for a scuffle and it was discovered that they belonged to Giuseppe Mazzini's Young Italy. They supplied various names and investigations were expanded to other garrisons. Charles Albert, who considered Mazzini's association the \"most terrible and bloody\", ordered the investigation to continue until it got to the bottom of the matter, acting in accordance with the law but with the utmost severity.\nIn the end, twelve people were executed by firing squad, and two committed suicide in jail. Twenty-one were condemned to death but could not be executed because they had escaped or, like Mazzini, had been abroad the whole time. Charles Albert granted no pardons, and the ambassadors of France and Britain in Turin protested at court about the severity of the punishment and the lack of any mercy. The King of Sardinia showed his gratitude to the investigators by granting honours to those who had played a leading role in the repression.\nSince the insurrections had failed, Mazzini began to plan a military expedition. In 1834, he attempted to organize a force in Switzerland, which would attack Savoy (then part of the Savoyard state) and the population would simultaneously rise against the king. But information about this plan was leaked and Charles Albert arranged an ambush. The invasion, undertaken on 2 February 1834, failed completely. This was partly due to disorganization, and partially to Swiss efforts to prevent Mazzini's expedition. Only a few conspirators attacked a barracks in Les \u00c9chelles. Two of them were captured and executed by firing squad. Carabiniere Giovanni Battista Scapaccino was killed in the process, and to honour him Charles Albert instituted the first gold medal in Italian history. Meanwhile, Giuseppe Garibaldi, who was preparing to lead a rising in the city, received a report that it was all over and fled. He was condemned to death \"in absentia\".\nLaw reform.\nIn these circumstances, Charles Albert realized the necessity of granting reforms to make the kingdom more modern and to satisfy the needs of the populace. Immediately on ascending to the throne he had named a commission which had been tasked with creating new civil, criminal, commercial and procedural laws. This process of reform took a very long time, but eventually, on 20 June 1837, the new civil code, partially inspired by the Napoleonic Code, was promulgated. The king also participated in the drafting of the new criminal code, which was published on 26 October 1839. During the process, Charles Albert insisted on the concept of corrective justice, limiting the death penalty as much as possible. Nevertheless, he ordained very severe penalties for those guilty of sacrilege or suicide (whose last wills and testaments had no legal power). In 1842, finally, the commercial code and the code of criminal procedure, with innovative guarantees of the rights of the accused, were promulgated.\nBeginning of crisis with Austria.\nIn 1840 the Oriental Crisis, which placed Louis Philippe's France in conflict with the other European great powers, inspired Charles Albert to begin thinking about a program of territorial expansion in the Po valley. In the same year, a commercial crisis erupted between Turin and Vienna, regarding an old treaty in which the Kingdom of Sardinia undertook not to provide salt to Switzerland. Following the breach of this treaty, Austria increased the customs duty on Piedmontese wine entering Lombardy-Veneto by 100%. Charles Albert's response was to threaten to build a railroad from Genoa to Lake Maggiore, in order to capture the German commerce which sustained the Austrian port of Trieste for the Ligurian ports.\nThese were still only minor disputes and diplomatic relations between the two states continued to be generally good, culminating in the magnificent wedding of Charles Albert's eldest son, Victor Emmanuel and Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Ranier Joseph of Habsburg-Lorraine, who was the Austrian Viceroy in Lombardy-Veneto and Charles Albert's brother-in-law, since he had married his sister Elisabeth in 1820. Victor Emmanuel and Adelaide were thus first cousins.\nLiberal sovereign (1845\u20131849).\nIn 1845, revolutionary movements erupted in Rimini and in the Papal States. To Massimo d'Azeglio, who had gone to report on the events, Charles Albert said, \"that on the day of conflict with Austria, he would throw himself in with his sons, with his army, with all his substance, to fight for the independence of Italy.\"\nOn 8 June 1846, on the orders of Chancellor Metternich, the Austrian ambassador to Turin, Karl Ferdinand von Buol, asked Charles Albert to clarify his position on whether he was with Austria or with the revolutionaries. The King of Sardinia hesitated. In the meanwhile, on 16 June, Pope Pius IX had been elected as Pope. His first order of business was to grant an amnesty to those condemned of political crimes. The new pope then protested against Austria for having occupied Ferrara, in the Holy See, without its consent. Charles Albert, who saw in Pius IX a way of reconciling his loyalty with his old liberal ideas, wrote to him offering his support.\nIn the same way, in September 1847, Cesare Trabucco, Charles Albert's secretary, was authorized to write a letter on 2 September, in which the king expressed his hope that God would grant him the power to undertake a war of independence in which he would take command of the army and the Guelph cause. These declarations made Charles Albert far more popular. However, he continued to break up anti-Austrian demonstrations because the court and government remained divided. De La Tour, Foreign Minister Solaro della Margarita, and Archbishop Luigi Fransoni considered the anti-Austrian policy exceptionally dangerous, but it was supported by Minister of War Emanuele Pes di Villamarina, Cesare Alfieri di Sostegno, Cesare Balbo, Massimo and Roberto d'Azeglio, and the young Count Cavour.\nMeanwhile, the demands of the people became pressing and were not always accepted. In this period, for example, Charles Albert did not accept a Genoese delegation which called for the expulsion of the Jesuits from the Kingdom, whom he had already banned from political writings. He did, however, implement the so-called Perfect Fusion of the Savoyard state on 29 November 1847, which extended the reforms carried out on the mainland to the island of Sardinia. At the beginning of 1848, news arrived that following the outbreak of the Spring of Nations, Ferdinand II had granted a constitution in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. In Turin there were acclamations for the King of Naples and the Pope, while Charles Albert remained bound by the oath he had sworn to Charles Felix to respect religiously all the fundamental laws of the monarchy, and to retain absolutist rule.\nAlbertine Statute.\nOn 7 January 1848, at the hotel \"Europa\" in Turin, there was a meeting of the city's journalists at which Cavour, director of the \"Risorgimento\", proposed to request a constitution from the king. The majority of the ministers were also in favour of the concession of a constitution, and of ensuring that one was not imposed by the people. Charles Albert was not sure what to do, unwilling to make the wrong decision and considered abdicating as Victor Emmanuel I had in similar circumstances. He sent for his son to prepare him for the succession, but his son managed to convince him to retain his position.\nOn 7 February, an extraordinary Council of State was convented. Seven ministers, the holders of the order of the Annunciation, and other high dignitaries were present. All of them spoke and the discussion went on for many hours. Charles Albert, pale, listened in silence. De La Tour, Carlo Giuseppe Beraudo di Pralormo, and Luigi Provana di Collegno were opposed to the constitution. During the lunch break, Charles Albert received a delegation from the capital, which asked for the constitution for the good of the people and in order to safeguard order.\nIt was now necessary to make a decision and, at last, Giacinto Borelli, Minister of the Interior, was appointed to draft the Constitution immediately. The document was approved and was named the \"Statute.\" Charles Albert had stated that he would not approve the document if it did not clearly state the pre-eminent position of the Catholic religion and the honour of the monarchy. Since he had received these things, he approved it. The meeting was dissolved at dawn.\nAround 3:30 in the afternoon on 8 February, a royal edict was published in the streets of Turin, which laid out the 14 articles which formed the basis of the Statute for a system of representative government. By 6:00 pm, the city was entirely lit up and massive demonstrations in favour of Charles Albert were held.\nThe edict specified that the Catholic faith was the sole state religion, and that executive power belonged to the king, as did command of the armed forces. Legislative power was vested in two chambers, one of which would be elected. The free press and individual liberty were guaranteed. The full version of the Statute, with all its articles, was finally agreed on 4 March 1848 and approved the same day by Charles Albert. The announcement of the Statute was met with great enthusiasm throughout Piedmont. The first constitutional government, presided over by Cesare Balbo, was sworn in on 16 March 1848, two days before the beginning of the Five Days of Milan.\nSpring of Nations.\nElected in 1846, the new pope Pius IX had caught the imagination of the liberals of Italy when he began to dismantle the archaic Vatican institutions: granting a free press, instituting the civic guard in place of foreign mercenaries, and creating a council of ministers. On 12 January 1848, there was a revolt in Palermo and King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies was forced to concede a constitution, but all of Europe was further convulsed when, in February 1848, there was a Revolution in France, King Louis Philippe was deposed, and a Republic was established. The revolution spread to Milan on 18 March, then to Venice, and finally to Vienna, where riots forced Metternich to flee and the abdication of Emperor Ferdinand I.\nIn Milan, it was expected that Charles Albert would take the opportunity to declare war on Austria. A clear message from Turin was delivered by the Milanese liberal, Francesco Arese Lucini on 19/20 March:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;You may be assured, sirs, that I am giving every possible provision: that I burn with desire to bring to your aid all that is in my power and that I will grasp even the smallest pretext that presents itself.\nAlthough the Kingdom's resources were small, the Piedmontese army began to mobilize. The majority of the troops were deployed on the western border since the eastern border was safeguarded by the treaty of alliance with Austria. But Charles Albert realised that this was a unique opportunity to expand his holdings into Lombardy. Thus he told the Milanese that he would intervene on their behalf if they agreed to join the Kingdom of Sardinia.\nOn 23 March 1848, the Piedmontese embassy to Milan returned to Turin with news that the Austrians had been forced to evacuate the city and that a provisional government headed by Gabrio Casati had been established, which asked Charles Albert to become an ally. Clearly not very enthusiastic about the idea of annexation, the Milanese asked the king to keep his troops outside the city and to adopt the tricolour of the Cisalpine Republic as his flag. Although he had received no guarantee that the Milanese would agree to annexation, Charles Albert accepted the conditions of the Milanese and asked only that the flag of the house of Savoy be placed in the middle of the tricolour (This would henceforth be the flag of the Kingdom of Sardinia and then the Kingdom of Italy until the fall of the monarchy in 1946). He was about to enter into a war with a major power, whose troops in Italy were commanded by one of the greatest living generals, Joseph Radetzky von Radetz. His reactionary past forgotten, the king appeared on the balcony of the royal palace, flanked by the Milanese representatives, waving the tricolour, while the people applauded and shouted, \"Long live Italy! Long live Charles Albert. Within a year his reign would be over.\nFirst Italian War of Independence.\nOn 23 March 1848, the proclamation of Charles Albert to the people of Lombardy and Veneto was published, in which he assured them that the Piedmontese troops, \"... go now to offer, in the final trials, that help which a brother expects from a brother, a friend from a friend. We will comply with your just requests, trusting in the aid of God, who is clearly with us, of God, who has given Italy Pius IX, of God, whose miraculous prompting places Italy in the position to act for itself.\" Thus, the war began. The federalist Carlo Cattaneo was not impressed, \"Now that the enemy is in flight, the king wants to come with the whole army. He should have sent us anything \u2212 even a single cart of powder \u2212 three days ago. There was heard, in Piedmont, for five days, the thundering of the guns which consumed us: The king knew and did not move.\"\nInitial campaign.\nCharles Albert left Turin on the evening of 26 March 1848 for Alessandria, to take command of the army and then advanced to Voghera. He was preoccupied with the delay of the provisional government of Milan's acceptance of annexation by the Kingdom of Sardinia. The Austrians however had regrouped on the River Mincio, at one corner of the Quadrilatero. On 29 March, the king entered Pavia in triumph, where he was met by some envoys of the Milanese government. On 2 April, Charles Albert was in Cremona, on 5 April at Bozzolo, on 6 April at Asola, on 8 April at Castiglione delle Stiviere, and on 11 April at Volta Mantovana, only four kilometres from the Mincio. After nearly two weeks, he had made it to the front.\nAt the opening of hostilities, on 8 and 9 April, Italian sharpshooters had achieved success in the first battle of the campaign at the Battle of Goito. After crossing the Mincio with his army, Charles Albert achieved another victory on 30 April at Pastrengo, where he saw the front lines. The units under his command attacked some Austrians who had been dispersed by a charge of the carabinieri on horseback. On 2 May, in the midst of this triumphant atmosphere, news arrived that Pius IX had withdrawn his military and political support for the Italian cause.\nNevertheless, the Papal soldiers in the army did not withdraw, choosing to remain to fight as volunteers, but Charles Albert had lost the moral justification for his mission. His dream of becoming the sword of the papacy and king of an Italy united under the Pope, as Vincenzo Gioberti had proposed, was thwarted. Yet the king was undiscouraged and continued to advance towards Verona, where a harsh and indecisive battle was fought with the Austrians at Santa Lucia on 6 May.\nTwo further events followed in the next few days. On 21 May, the contingent of 14,000 men from the Neapolitan army which were \"en route\" to fight against the Austrians, were ordered by Ferdinand II to return home in light of Pius IX's decision. Then on 25 May, the Austrian reinforcements which had been traveling through Veneto, joined Radetzky's troops at Verona. Charles Albert was ambitious but had only modest strategic abilities and he could not realistically continue the war alone. The Battle of Goito and the surrender of Peschiera on 30 May were his last successes. The Austrians conquered Vicenza on 10 June, dispersing the Papal volunteers and finally obtained a decisive victory over the Piedmontese in the Battle of Custoza, which lasted from the 22 to 27 July.\nIn the meantime, on 8 June, the Milanese and Lombards had voted with an overwhelming majority to join the Kingdom of Sardinia, as had the citizens of the Duchy of Parma on 2 May. But for Charles Albert, things were going sour: the soldiers were angry about the recent defeat and were hungry and exhausted. A council of war suggested seeking a truce.\nEvents in Milan and armistice of Salasco.\nOn the evening of 27 July 1848, the Austrians agreed to grant a truce if the Piedmontese withdrew to the west bank of the Adda (a little more than 20\u00a0km east of Milan), surrendered all the fortresses, including Peschiera and yielded the Duchies of Parma and Modena, whose rulers had been forced into exile. Charles Albert, who disagreed with his son Victor Emmanuel on the conduct of the war, exclaimed \"I would rather die!\" and prepared to make a stand at the Oglio (about 25\u00a0km further east than requested by Radetzky).\nAlthough the Austrian proposal had been rejected, his troops ended up having to withdraw to the Adda river anyway, because the Oglio river was held to be an inadequate defensive line. At the river Adda, some manoeuvres taken by a general on his own initiative left a division isolated and made it necessary to withdraw again, in order to retreat inside the walls of Milan. Charles Albert went to the Palazzo Greppi, ignoring the Milanese desire to resist, he negotiated the surrender of the city to the Austrians in exchange for permitting the safe withdrawal of the army to Piedmont.\nThe next day, the Milanese learned of the agreement and revealed their fury. The crowd protested in front of the Palazzo Greppi and when the King came out on the balcony, they fired their rifles at him. According to the noblewoman Cristina Trivulzio di Belgiojoso, who participated actively in the riots in Milan:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A contingent of the national guard went up to interrogate Charles Albert on the reason for the surrender. He turned them away, but was forced despite himself to follow some deputies onto the balcony, from which he spoke to the people, apologizing for his ignorance of the true feelings of the Milanese, saying that he was delighted that they came to the defence so quickly, and solemnly promising to strive for them with his last drop of blood. A round from a rifle was fired against Charles Albert. At the final words of his speech, the indignant crowd shouted \"If you're so wounded from surrendering!\" Then the king took a piece of paper from his pocket, which he held up for the people to see, and ripped it to pieces. Charles Albert's second son Ferdinand and general Alfonso Ferrero La Marmora carried the king to safety. In the night he departed from Milan with the army. On 8 August, general Carlo Canera di Salasco returned to Milan and negotiated an armistice with the Austrians, known as the Armistice of Salasco, which was signed on 9 August. Charles Albert ratified the armistice despite some opposition, including from Gioberti, who remained confident of aid from France. The king said that the former French foreign minister, Alphonse de Lamartine, had declared that the French would only give such aid to Republicans.\nSecond campaign and abdication.\nThe king was not proud of the campaign and, once he had written a record of the first campaign, Charles Albert decided to break the armistice. On 1 March, at the inauguration of the legislature, he spoke clearly about war and Chamber responded positively. For the imminent resumption of hostilities, the king was convinced to renounce effective command of the army, which he continued to hold formally. Rather than appointing a Piedmontese general, he selected the Polish general Wojciech Chrzanowski as commander of the army. On 8 March, the council of war in Turin decided that the armistice would be broken on the 12th. According to the terms of the armistice, hostilities would then begin eight days later on 20 March.\nThe war did indeed resume on that day. On 22 March, Charles Albert arrived at Novara and a day later, Radetzy attacked the city from the south with superior numbers, near the village of Bicocca. Chrzanowski made some significant tactical errors and despite the bravery of the Piedmontese and Charles Albert himself, who fought along with his son Ferdinand in the front lines, the Battle of Novara proved a disastrous defeat.\nReturning to the Palazzo Bellini in Novara, the king declared, \"Bicocca was lost and retaken three or four times, before our troops were forced to yield... the Major General [Chrzanowski] employed all his strength, my sons did everything they could, the Duke of Genoa [Ferdinand] lost two horses from under himself. Now we have withdrawn within the city, on its walls, with the enemy below, with an exhausted army \u2013 further resistance is impossible. It is necessary to request an armistice.\"\nAustria's conditions were very harsh: occupation of the Lomellina and the fortress of Alessandria, as well as the surrender of all the Lombards who had fought against Austria. Charles Albert asked the generals if it was possible for a final push to open a path to Alessandria. They said it was not: the army was in pieces, discipline had crumbled, many soldiers fighting in the campaign were despoiling the houses in the countryside and they feared an attack on the king himself.\nAt 9:30 pm on the same day, Charles Albert summoned his sons, Chrzanowski, generals Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora, Carlo Emanuele La Marmora, Giovanni Durando, Luigi Fecia di Cossato (who had negotiated the armistice) and minister Carlo Cadorna. He confessed that he had no choice but to abdicate. They tried to dissuade him, but, in the hope that Victor Emmanuel could get better terms, he ended the discussion, \"My decision is the fruit of mature reflection. From this moment, I am no longer the king; the king is Victor, my son.\"\nExile (1849).\nCharles Albert's eldest son became king of Sardinia as Victor Emmanuel II and agreed to an armistice with Radetzky on 24 March 1849 at Vignale, effectively obtaining more favourable terms than previously offered. The Austrians were to occupy Lomellina for a while and only half of the fort of Alessandria, with \"permission\" rather than \"by right\".\nVoyage to Portugal.\nCharles Albert, however, had left Palazzo Bellini in Novara a few minutes after midnight on 23 March. His carriage travelled to Orfengo (on the road halfway between Novara and Vercelli), probably without any specific destination in mind, but after a little while he was stopped at an Austrian roadblock. Charles Albert identified himself as the Count of Barge (a title which he actually possessed) and a colonel of the Piedmontese army. General Georg Thurn Valsassina (1788\u20131866) interrogated him and it is not clear whether he recognized him or not. Having been confirmed as the Count of Barge by a captured sharpshooter (when asked \"can you confirm that this is the Count of Barge?\" the soldier responded, \"He is the Count of Barge.\"), Charles Albert was allowed to pass and continued his journey to the southwest.\nThe former king continued via Moncalvo, Nizza Monferrato, Acqui, Savona, Ventimiglia and Monaco, which he reached on 26 March. At Nice in France, he dispatched instructions to organize his family affairs, without adding any information for his wife. On 1 April, he was at Bayonne, near the Atlantic coast, and on 3 April he received a message from Turin in order to get him to legally confirm his abdication.\nCharles Albert continued through Torquemada, Valladolid, Le\u00f3n, and A Coru\u00f1a, which he reached on 10 April, and which was the end of the carriage road. On horseback, suffering from illness, he reached Lugo on 15 April and entered Portuguese territory at Caminha. From there he went to Viana do Castelo, P\u00f3voa de Varzim and, finally, on 19 April, at noon, he arrived in Porto. From there he may have planned to travel to America, but he was forced to stop because he had become ill with a liver complaint.\nFinal days in Porto.\nOnce his arrival in Porto became known, Charles Albert was hosted at the \"Hotel do Peixe\", where he remained for two weeks, as his condition worsened. Then he accepted a new residence from a private individual on the \"rua de Entre Quintas\", with a view of the ocean. On 3 May, he hosted Giacinto Provana di Collegno and Luigi Cibrario, who brought him greetings from the Piedmontese government. To them, he said: \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Despite my abdication, if ever a new war arises against Austria... I will come running immediately, even if only as a simple soldier, among the ranks of her enemies... I am equally raised up by the thought and the hope that... the day will come which I tried to bring about... The nation could have had a better prince than me, but not one that loved her more. To make her free, independent and great... I carried out every sacrifice with a happy heart... I sought death [in battle] and did not find it...\u2014\u200a\nDuring this time, Charles Albert suffered from progressive decay, coughing and abscesses. He had two heart attacks, but the doctors considered the condition of his liver the most serious issue, for which the former king abstained from eating very much and fasted on Wednesdays. He read the letters and newspapers which arrived from Italy. He wrote occasionally to his wife, but regularly and with feeling to the Countess of Robilant. He forbade his mother, wife, and children from visiting.\nIn the month after his arrival, his health had deteriorated irreparably. From 3 July, he was assisted by the doctor Alessandro Riberi, whom Victor Emmanuel had sent from Turin. He was no longer able to get out of bed and coughing fits were ever more frequent. He passed the night of 27 July in great difficulty. On the morning of 28 July, he seemed better, but then deteriorated as a result of a third heart attack. The Portuguese priest don Antonio Peixoto, who had assisted him spiritually, met with him and administered extreme unction. Charles Albert whispered in Latin, \"In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum\" (Into your hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit). He fell asleep with the crucifix on his chest and died at 3:30 in the afternoon, a little over 51 years old.\nHis body was embalmed and displayed in the Cathedral of Porto. On 3 September, the ships, \"Mozambano\" and \"Goito\" arrived under the command of his cousin Eugene Emmanuel. On 19 September the corpse was brought on board the \"Monzambano\", which departed for Genoa that evening. It arrived on 4 October. The funeral took place in Turin Cathedral on 13 October, with Alexis Billiet, Archbishop of Chamb\u00e9ry, presiding along with five Piedmontese bishops, and was well-attended by the people. The day after, the body was solemnly interred in the crypt of the Basilica of Superga, where it still lies.\nLegacy.\nAbout Charles Albert, Friedrich Engels wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Among the indigenous princes, the number one enemy of Italian freedom was and is Charles Albert. Italians should bear in mind and repeat every hour the old saying: \"God watch over my friends, so that I can watch over my enemies\". From Ferdinand of the House of Bourbon, there is nothing to fear; he has for a long time been discredited. Charles Albert, on the other hand, calls himself pompously the \"liberator of Italy\" while on the very people he is supposed to be liberating he imposes as a condition the yoke of his rule.\nAmerican historian Alfred Thayer Mahan described Charles Albert thusly:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A strange pathetic being, at odds with himself and his time; compounded of monkish asceticism and soldierly courage; autocratic, but irresolute; holding his honor dearer than his life, yet pursued through life by accusations of dishonor: such was Charles Albert, to whom when he had passed beyond the reach of their praises or their blame, his countrymen gave the epithet 'magnanimous'.\nFamily and children.\nIn 1817, Charles Albert married his second cousin once removed, Maria Theresa of Tuscany, the youngest daughter of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany, and Princess Luisa of Naples and Sicily. The couple had the following children:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69578", "revid": "1311402989", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69578", "title": "Fulla", "text": "Norse deity\nFulla (Old Norse: , possibly 'bountiful') or Volla (Old High German, 'plenitude') is a goddess in Germanic mythology. In Norse mythology, Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and as tending to the ashen box and the footwear owned by the goddess Frigg, and, in addition, Frigg confides in Fulla her secrets. Fulla is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry. Volla (\"Folla\") is attested in the \"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation, recorded anonymously in the 10th century in Old High German, in which she assists in healing the wounded foal of Phol and is referred to as Frigg's sister. Scholars have proposed theories about the implications of the goddess.\nName.\nThe Old Norse name \"Fulla\" has been translated as 'bountiful'. It stems from Proto-Germanic \"*full\u014dn\" ('fullness, plenitude'; cf. Gothic \"fullo\" 'fullness', OHG \"folla\" 'plenitude'), itself a derivative of the adjective \"*fullaz\" ('full'; cf. ON \"fullr\", Goth. \"fulls\", OHG \"foll\", all meaning 'full'). The latter derives from Proto-Indo-European *\"plh\u2081-n\u00f3-\" ('filled, full'; cf. Skt \"p\u016br\u1e47\u00e1\" 'full', Lith. \"p\u00eclnas\", OCS \"pl\u044cn\u044c\" 'filled, full'), a past participle of the verbal root \"*pelh\u2081-\" ('to fill').\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the prose introduction to the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\", Frigg makes a wager with her husband the god Odin over the hospitality of their human patrons. Frigg sends her servant maid Fulla to warn the king Geirr\u00f6d\u2014Frigg's patron\u2014that a magician (actually Odin in disguise) will visit him. Fulla meets with Geirr\u00f6d, gives the warning, and advises to him a means of detecting the magician:\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Fulla fifth, stating that, like the goddess Gefjun, Fulla is a virgin, wears her hair flowing freely with a gold band around her head. High describes that Fulla carries Frigg's \"eski\", looks after Frigg's footwear, and that in Fulla Frigg confides secrets.\nIn chapter 49 of \"Gylfaginning\", High details that, after the death of the deity couple Baldr and Nanna, the god Herm\u00f3\u00f0r wagers for their return in the underworld location of Hel. Hel, ruler of the location of the same name, tells Herm\u00f3\u00f0r a way to resurrect Baldr, but will not allow Baldr and Nanna to leave until the deed is accomplished. Hel does, however, allow Baldr and Nanna to send gifts to the living; Baldr sends Odin the ring Draupnir, and Nanna sends Frigg a robe of linen, and \"other gifts.\" Of these \"other gifts\" sent, the only specific item that High mentions is a finger-ring for Fulla.\nThe first chapter of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", Fulla is listed among eight \u00e1synjur who attend an evening drinking banquet held for \u00c6gir. In chapter 19 of \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", poetic ways to refer to Frigg are given, one of which is by referring to her as \"queen [...] of Fulla.\" In chapter 32, poetic expressions for gold are given, one of which includes \"Fulla's snood.\" In chapter 36, a work by the skald Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir is cited that references Fulla's golden headgear (\"the falling sun [gold] of the plain [forehead] of Fulla's eyelashes shone on [...]\"). Fulla receives a final mention in the \"Prose Edda\" in chapter 75, where Fulla appears within a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names.\n\"Horse Cure\" Merseburg Incantation.\nOne of the two Merseburg Charms (the \"horse cure\"), recorded in Old High German, mentions a deity named Volla. The incantation describes how Phol and Wodan rode to a wood, and there Balder's foal sprained its foot. Sinthgunt sang charms, her sister Sunna sang charms, Friia sang charms, her sister Volla sang charms, and finally Wodan sang charms, followed by a verse describing the healing of the foal's bone. The charm reads:\nPhol and Wodan went to the forest.\nThen Balder's horse sprained its foot.\nThen Sinthgunt sang charms, and Sunna her sister;\nThen Friia sang charms, and Volla her sister;\nThen Wodan sang charms, as he well could:\nbe it bone-sprain, be it blood-sprain, be it limb-sprain:\nbone to bone, blood to blood,\nlimb to limb, so be they glued together.\nTheories.\nAndy Orchard comments that the seeming appearance of Baldr with Volla in the Merseburg Incantation is \"intriguing\" since Fulla is one of the three goddesses (the other two being Baldr's mother Frigg and his wife Nanna) the deceased Baldr expressly sends gifts to from Hel. John Lindow says that since the name \"Fulla\" seems to have something to do with fullness, it may also point to an association with fertility.\nRudolf Simek comments that while Snorri notes that Baldr sends Fulla a golden ring from Hel in \"Gylfaginning\", \"this does not prove that she plays any role in the Baldr myth, but merely shows that Snorri associated her with gold\" because of kennings used associating Fulla with gold. Simek says that since Fulla appears in the poetry of Skalds as early as the 10th century that she was likely \"not a late personification of plenty\" but that she is very likely identical with Volla from the Merseburg Incantation. Simek adds that it is unclear as to who Fulla actually is, and argues that she may be an independent deity or simply identical with the goddess Freyja or with Frigg.\nJohn Knight Bostock says that theories have been proposed that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. As a result, this notion has resulted in theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of the goddesses Sinthgunt and Sunna, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.\nHilda Ellis Davidson states that the goddesses Gefjun, Ger\u00f0r, Fulla, and Ska\u00f0i \"may represent important goddesses of early times in the North, but little was remembered about them by the time Snorri was collecting his material.\" On the other hand, Davidson notes that it is also possible that these goddesses are viewable as aspects of a single Great Goddess. Davidson calls Fulla and Volla \"vague, uncertain figures, emerging from odd references to goddesses which Snorri has noted in the poets, but they suggest the possibility that at one time three generations were represented among the goddesses of fertility and harvest in Scandinavia.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Owned by the TATRA TRUCKS a.s. company, it is the third oldest company in the world producing motor vehicles with an unbroken history. The company was founded in 1850 as \"Ignatz Schustala &amp; Cie\". In 1890, it became a joint-stock company and was renamed the \"Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft\". In 1897, the \"Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft\" produced the Pr\u00e4sident, which was the first factory-produced automobile with a petrol engine to be made in Central and Eastern Europe. The First Truck was made a year later, in 1898. In 1918, the company was renamed \"Kop\u0159ivnick\u00e1 vozovka a.s.\", and in 1919 it changed from the Nesselsdorfer marque to the \"Tatra\" badge, named after the nearby Tatra Mountains on the Czechoslovak-Polish border (now on the Polish-Slovak border).\nIn the interwar period, Tatra came to international prominence with its line of affordable cars based on backbone tube chassis and air-cooled engines, starting with Tatra 11 (1923). The company also became the pioneer of automotive aerodynamics, starting with Tatra 77 (1934). Following the 1938 German-Czechoslovak war and Munich Agreement, the town of Kop\u0159ivnice was occupied by Nazi Germany and Tatra's manufacturing capacity was directed towards military production. Trucks like Tatra 111 (1942) became instrumental both for the German Nazi war effort as well as post-war reconstruction in Central Europe and Soviet Union.\nToday, Tatra's production focuses on heavy, off-road trucks based on its century-long development of backbone chassis, swinging half-axles, and air-cooled engines. The core of its production consists of the Tatra 817, intended primarily for military operators, and the Tatra Phoenix (Tatra chassis with DAF cabin and Paccar water-cooled engine), aimed primarily for the civilian market. In 2023, the company plans to produce over 2,000 trucks.\nEarly years.\nIn 1850, Ignaz Schustala founded \"Ignatz Schustala &amp; Cie\" in Kop\u0159ivnice, and the company entered the business of manufacturing horse-drawn vehicles.\nIn the 1880s, the company began manufacturing railroad cars.\nIn 1890, the company became a joint-stock company, and was renamed the \"Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau-Fabriksgesellschaft\". Also that year, Hugo Fischer von R\u00f6slerstamm became the company's technical director. After Schustala died in 1891, von R\u00f6slerstamm took over the management of the business.\nIn 1897, the company began the creation of an automobile with an internal combustion engine. Using a Benz automobile purchased by von R\u00f6slerstamm as inspiration, the company built its first car, the Pr\u00e4sident, under the direction of engineers Hans Ledwinka and Edmund Rumpler. The Pr\u00e4sident was exhibited in Vienna later that year. The company began taking orders for cars, and between 1897 and 1900, nine improved cars based on the Pr\u00e4sident were made.\nThe first car to be completely designed by Ledwinka was the Nesselsdorf A, which was produced in 1900. The Nesselsdorf A was equipped with a rear-mounted engine, and had a top speed of . 22 units were built.\nThe Nesselsdorf A was followed in 1902 by the Type B, which featured a central engine.\nLedwinka then left the company to concentrate on steam engine development. He returned in 1905 and designed a completely new car, the Type S, which was equipped with a 4-cylinder engine.\nIn 1912, production was badly affected by a strike that lasted 23 weeks, and von R\u00f6slerstamm left the company. In 1916, Ledwinka left the company again, this time to work for one of its competitors, Steyr-Werke in Graz.\nTatra concept.\nIn 1919, the company began using the Tatra brand for its cars.\nIn 1921, the company was renamed \"Kop\u0159ivnick\u00e1 vozovka\". That year, the company's director, Leopold Pasching, convinced Ledwinka to return to the company to run its new car plant.\nLedwinka's next design, the Tatra 11, which was released in 1923, featured a rigid backbone tube with swinging semi-axles at the rear, giving independent suspension. The Tatra 11 was fitted with a front-mounted, air-cooled two-cylinder engine.\nIn 1924, the company was renamed \"\"Z\u00e1vody Tatra\".\nThe Tatra 17, released in 1925, featured a water-cooled six-cylinder engine, and fully independent suspension.\nIn 1926, the Tatra 11 was succeeded by the Tatra 12, which was similar to the Tatra 11, but was equipped with four-wheel brakes.\nIn 1927, the company was renamed \"Ringhoffer-Tatra\"\".\nPrewar streamliners.\nTatra's specialty was luxury cars using the most recent technology, going from air-cooled flat-twins to fours and sixes, culminating (briefly) with the OHC 6-litre V12 in 1931. In the 1930s, under the supervision of Austrian engineer Hans Ledwinka, his son Erich and German engineer Erich \u00dcbelacker, and protected by high tariffs and absence of foreign assemblers, Tatra began building advanced, streamlined cars after obtaining licences from Paul Jaray, which started in 1934 with the large Tatra 77, the world's first production aerodynamic car. The average drag coefficient of a 1:5 model of the fastback Tatra 77 was recorded as 0.2455. It featured (as did almost all subsequent big Tatras) a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 engine.\nTatra and the conception of the Volkswagen Beetle.\nBoth Adolf Hitler and Ferdinand Porsche were influenced by the Tatras. Hitler was a keen automotive enthusiast, and had ridden in Tatras during political tours of Czechoslovakia. He had also dined numerous times with Ledwinka. After one of these dinners Hitler remarked to Porsche, \"This is the car for my roads\". From 1933 onwards, Ledwinka and Porsche met regularly to discuss their designs, and Porsche admitted \"Well, sometimes I looked over his shoulder and sometimes he looked over mine\" while designing the Volkswagen. There is no doubt that the Beetle bore a striking resemblance to the Tatras, particularly the Tatra V570. Like the Beetle, the Tatra 97 of 1936 had a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder boxer engine accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet and behind the rear seat. Another similarity between this Tatra and the Beetle is the central structural tunnel. Tatra launched a lawsuit against Volkswagen for patent infringement, but this was stopped when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. At the same time, Tatra was forced to stop producing the T97. The matter was reopened after World War II, and in 1965 Volkswagen paid the Ringhoffer family in an out-of-court settlement.\nTatra and Volkswagen's body design were preceded by similar designs of Hungarian automotive engineer B\u00e9la Bar\u00e9nyi, whose sketches resembling the Volkswagen Beetle date back to 1925.\nWar years.\nAfter the 1938 invasion of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany, Tatras were kept in production, largely because Germans liked the cars. Many German officers died in car accidents caused by driving the heavy, rear-engined Tatras faster around corners than they could handle. At the time, as an anecdote, Tatra became known as the 'Czech Secret Weapon' for the scores of officers who died behind the wheel; at one point official orders were issued forbidding German officers from driving Tatras.\nTatra was instrumental in the production of trucks and tank engines for the German war effort.\nPostwar management.\nThe factory was nationalised in 1945, almost three years before the Communist Party came to power, and in January 1946 was renamed \"\". Although production of prewar models continued, a new model, the Tatra 600 Tatraplan was designed\u2014the name celebrating the new Communist planned economy and the aeroplane inspiration (Colloq. Czech: aeropl\u00e1n). It went into production in 1948. In 1951, the state planning department decided that the Tatraplan should henceforth be built at the \u0160koda plant in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, leaving Tatra free to concentrate on trucks, buses, and railway equipment.\nThe Tatra 603.\nIn 1953, amid much dissatisfaction among Communist party leaders with the poor-quality official cars imported from Russia, Tatra was again permitted to produce a luxury car, the Tatra 603. Much like Tatra's prewar cars, it was driven by a rear-mounted, air-cooled V8 and had the company's trademark aerodynamic styling. The Tatra 603 initially featured three headlights, and the first prototypes had a central rear stabilising fin, though this feature was lost on production vehicles. It was also fitted with almost American-style thick chrome bumpers with bullets (a.k.a. Dagmar bumpers). Almost entirely hand-built, Tatras were not available for normal citizens as they were not permitted to buy them. The cars were reserved for the Communist Party elite and industrial officials, as well as being exported to most other communist nations as official state cars. Notably, Cuban President Fidel Castro had a white Tatra 603, custom-fitted with air conditioning.\nTatra 603s were built until 1975, a twenty-year reign as one of communism's finest cars. Numerous improvements were made during its production run, although not all vehicles built were actually new but rather reconditioned. In exchange for a newer model year car, the older vehicle was returned to the factory. There, it was upgraded to current model year specifications, refinished, and sent out again as a putatively new vehicle to replace another older T603. This makes it difficult to trace the history of surviving vehicles.\n1970s makeover\u2014the Tatra 613.\nIn 1968, a replacement was developed: the Tatra 613. It was styled by the Italian styling house of Vignale and was a more modern, less rounded shape. It was not until 1973 that the car went into production, and volume production did not begin until the following year. Although the layout remained the same, the body was all new, as was the engine, which was equipped with four overhead camshafts, a higher capacity motor (3495\u00a0cc) and an output close to . In addition, it had been moved somewhat forward for improved balance. These cars were built in five series and went through several modifications until production ceased in 1996. Over 11,000 cars were built, and sales slowed to a trickle of just a few dozen per year towards the end of production as Tatras began to seem more and more outdated.\n1990s Tatra 700.\nThe Tatra 700 was a large luxury car released in 1996 by Tatra. It was essentially a heavily restyled version of the Tatra 613 model it replaced, with updated body panels and detailing. The T700 was offered as both a saloon and coup\u00e9 with either a 3.5 or 4.4 litre 90\u00b0 air-cooled V8 petrol engine.\nThe model was neither successful nor produced in large numbers, with a total of 69\u201372 cars manufactured. The T700 was the last passenger car made by Tatra, with production halting in 1999. At this point, Tatra abandoned automobile manufacturing to concentrate on truck design and manufacture.\n1990s Tatra MTX V8.\nThe Tatra MTX V8 was the fastest Czech car of all time. Production started in 1991 in Kop\u0159ivnice. It has a Tatra 623 V8 engine with inlet manifold injection producing 225\u00a0kW at 6500 rpm. It accelerates from 0\u2013 in 5.6 seconds. The top speed is . The Czech designer V\u00e1clav Kr\u00e1l designed this vehicle, with only five ever produced.\n2000s.\nIn February 2008, Tatra announced the world's first and only air-cooled engine meeting the then forthcoming Euro 5 emissions standards. The press release claims 7.5 times lower emissions of particulates and 3.5 times lower emissions of nitrogen oxides compared to the previous engine. Further, production of air-cooled engines should significantly reduce the production of greenhouse gases due to the absence of liquid cooling systems. All Tatra vehicles from February 2008 onwards should use the new engine. A month later, Tatra CEO Ronald Adams told \"The Prague Post\" Tatra could return to producing passenger cars, saying: \"We would not come back to compete with the large automobile mass producers such as Volkswagen, \u0160koda, Toyota etc. But we might come back with a replica of the old Tatra cars using a current undercarriage and driveline from one of the major automotive producers.\" The company has launched a feasibility study, hoping to produce one thousand replicas of their legendary Tatraplan and 603 cars in 2010.\nIn July 2008, pictures of a fuel cell concept car designed by Mike Jelinek, the Tatra 903, were shown.\nA Tatra 87 is on exhibit at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts.\nTrucks.\n1898\u20131914 beginning.\nThe first truck manufactured at Kop\u0159ivnice in 1898 was a flatbed with two liquid-cooled side-by-side-mounted two-cylinder Benz engines each at 2.7\u00a0L capacity with total power output of 8.8\u00a0kW (12\u00a0hp) placed after the rear axle and cargo capacity of 2.5 ton. The unique feature of the engine setup was that the engines could be operated sequentially depending on the load requirements. No. 1 engine was started via a cranking handle and had a flywheel attached, and No. 2 engine, without the flywheel, was connected via a gear clutch and started by the first engine already running.\nThe second truck manufactured was once again a flatbed R type of 2.5 ton cargo capacity built in 1909. Powered by a liquid-cooled petrol four-cylinder engine of 4.1 L capacity and power output of 18.4\u00a0kW (25\u00a0hp) with the engine placed above the front axle, which is the conventional design to this day. The vehicle featured solid rubber tyres and semi-elliptic leaf spring suspension. In 1910, Tatra manufactured its first bus, the Omnibus type SO, with a total production of five units.\n1914\u20131922 serial production.\nThe first true serial truck production at Tatra was instigated by the beginning of World War I. In the year 1914, there were only two trucks made, type T 14/40 HP; however, by 1915's end, the production jumped to a total of 105 TL-2 units, and the following year, 1916, the numbers rose to a total of 196 TL-2 and 30 TL-4. Production peaked in 1917 with 19 TL-2 and 303 TL-4 models, but then production declined, and a similar number of vehicles of one type manufactured in a year was not achieved or surpassed until 1936 with the T 27 model.\nTechnically, models TL-2 and TL-4 were almost identically designed; in fact, TL-4 evolved from TL-2, where both had liquid-cooled OHC engines of max power output of . The TL-2 had a GVM and GCM, TL-4 had GVM and GCM respectively. Both types remained in production in small series until 1927. The TL-4 is considered the first truck to come out of NW (Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau) to carry the name Tatra in 1919.\n1923\u20131938 Tatra concept.\nAfter the introduction of Tatra 11 and Tatra 12 cars with their distinctive backbone tube design and swing axles, Tatra introduced its first truck on the same basis, the light utility Tatra 13 powered by 2-cylinder air-cooled petrol engine with power output 8.8\u00a0kW (12\u00a0hp) and cargo capacity. Further models followed, and in 1926, T23 and T24 were introduced, nicknamed \"bulldogs\", which could be considered Tatra's precursors to COE designed trucks. Improved version T13 was introduced as T26 with a more powerful 4-cylinder flat air-cooled engine and in six-wheeler chassis created capable offroad light utility truck which later evolved into T72 model which was heavily used by Czechoslovakian army at the time and was also manufactured under license by the French company Lorraine-Dietrich. In 1933, Tatra built a limited series of T25 heavy artillery tractors with 4 and 6-cylinder petrol engines. The most popular Tatra truck before World War II was type T27 powered by 4-cylinder petrol or diesel engines, which remained in production for nearly 17 years (1930\u20131947) with total production of 7,620 units. By adding an extra axle to the rear, the type T28 was created; however, it was not successful and only limited production resulted in a mainly bus chassis. In the period from 1931 to 1938, Tatra also built a small utility truck based on the chassis from T30 named Tatra T43 which remained popular with small business owners. T72 model successfully continued the line to T82 built mainly for military in cargo and personnel transport between 1935 and 1938 and further to T92 and T93 built for the Romanian army from 1938 to 1941 which were identical except T93 had also a driven front axle.\n1939\u20131956 World War II and beyond.\nFollowing the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia, the production at Kop\u0159ivnice was annexed by the Germans for the supply of trucks needed by the Wehrmacht. Apart from the existing line-up of T27, T92/92, a new heavy truck, the T81, commenced production featuring a liquid-cooled 12.5 L V8 diesel engine with a power output of , in 6\u00d74 axle configuration. This vehicle evolved in 1942 into the T111 which continued in production until 1962, with a total of 33,690 units made. The T111 also featured Tatra's first air-cooled diesel engine, a massive V12 originally designed for the armoured Sd.Kfz. 234 Puma. In the latter stages of World War II, Tatra was instrumental in the development of air-cooled diesel engines for German tanks. In late 1944, General Heinz Guderian ordered that production of the Type 38(t) Hetzer tank be modified to incorporate a Tatra Type 928 V-8 air-cooled diesel engine, though this order was delayed so production could continue uninterrupted. After the war, the T111 contributed heavily to the rebuilding effort in Central and Eastern Europe, and a memorial was built at Magadan, Siberia, for its exploits in the Far East of the USSR.\n1957\u20131982 moving forward.\nThe decision to replace the reliable but ageing T111 was taken in 1952 based on central planning economy of socialist government where directive was made to Tatra N.P. that it should concentrate on the manufacture of 7 to 10 ton capacity commercial vehicles and in 1956 first T137 and T138 trucks were exhibited at the Czechoslovak machinery expo in Brno. Production of the T111 continued alongside the T138 series until 1962. The T138 itself continued in production until 1969 when it was replaced by the T148, which provided an increase in power output, reliability, and product improvements.\nIn 1967, Tatra began production of the T813 off-road truck using its modular construction technology; the model incorporated the latest trends in commercial vehicle design, such as cab-over-engine (COE) and wide profile tyres. It featured a new V12 engine, and all military versions had a central tyre inflation/deflation system as standard equipment. The T813 was designed to tow loads up to 100 tons GCM, and it was a familiar sight on the roads in Czechoslovakia hauling large, often oversized loads.\n1982\u20132008 T815 and beyond.\nThe Tatra 815 was designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions are derived from the off-road original. After the 53rd session of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, a directive was issued that Tatra N.P. would be the sole supplier of off-road commercial vehicles of &lt;12 ton capacity for Eastern Bloc countries, leading to a modernization of the company and its production models. Following extensive testing at different sites, including Siberia, the type T815 was introduced in 1982, with production starting in 1983. The T815 was made of 142 main assembly components as opposed to the 219 main assembly components of its predecessor. The engine's power output was increased by up to 45% and a new COE tiltable cabin was introduced. Modular engine designs resulted in offerings of V8, V10, or V12 engines with or without a turbocharger.\nT815 was upgraded to T815-2 with minor cosmetic changes and improved ergonomics and safety \u2013 the biggest change was the engine emissions accordance with the \"Euro0\" limits and to Euro I limits in 1993 (turbocharged V8 engine only since this time for the full legislation; the Deutz 513 air-cooled V8 engine was offered as an alternative). The TerrNo1, introduced in 1997, featured a redesigned cabin as well as better sound and heat insulation than the previous models. The TerrNo1 was based on the same frame as the previous models, so its cabin could be retrofitted to all type T815s built since 1993. In 2000, the TerrNo1 cabin was again redesigned, and for the first time, there was an option to fit liquid-cooled engines.\nThe TerrNo1 model introduced the 'KingFrame rear axle suspension setup. Another step in evolution for the T3B engine came with the Euro II emission limits. Following further improvements in 2003, the T815 had the new Euro III T3C V8 engine mated to all new 14-speed range+split gearbox as well as an option for engines from other suppliers such as Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Deutz and MTU to be fitted. In September 2006, Tatra introduced its Euro IV compliant turbocharged T3D engine with the SCR exhaust technology, and in February 2008, the company introduced the world's first Euro V-compliant air-cooled diesel engine based on the T3D engine.\nThe T816 (T815-6) Armax and Force series, derivatives of Tatra 815, were introduced in 1993 after Tatra participated in the tender process to supply heavy duty off-road trucks to the UAE armed forces. After two years of bidding, the company secured a contract worth $180 million.\nThe resulting model became known as T816 \"LIWA\" (Arabic for \"desert\"). The latest model intended for military customers is the T817 (T815-7), marketed primarily toward the armed services of NATO member countries as a high-mobility heavy-duty tactical truck with a low profile cabin for C-130 Hercules transportability.\nDuring the 1990s, Tatra decided to produce a bonneted CBE heavy-duty off-road truck to continue the successful line started with the T111. This resulted in the T163 Jamal, which was put into full production in 1999 after the first prototypes were built in 1997 and following extensive testing. The T163 was purpose-built to be a heavy-duty dump truck due to demand, and was based on Tatra's signature backbone tube chassis construction with its cabin being designed by Ji\u0159\u00ed \u0160panihel. The truck is used mainly on construction sites and in quarries.\nTatra was also a successful bidder for the Czech Army replacement of aging Praga V3S (with the Tatra I6 air-cooled engine \u2013 one half of the T111 V12 one) medium off-road truck with T810 which technically is not a \"genuine\" Tatra as its origin goes back to when former Czech company ROSS, in partnership with Renault Trucks, obtained a contract to supply the army with medium size off-road trucks, the \"ROSS R210 6\u00d76\". The company, however, went bankrupt in 1998, and Tatra bought full rights to the design, then modernized and reintroduced it as T810 while continuing cooperation with Renault. Under the deal Renault supplies the cabins and the engines and Praga supplied axles and transmissions for the prototypes; however, the whole project has been dogged by controversy due to the way Tatra had obtained the contract, its relationship with supplier Praga and the subsequent court case brought against it by Praga.\nThe serial T810 vehicles are equipped with the new design Tatra rigid axles with the WABCO disc brakes, with the ZF Ecolite transmission and Steyr drop box.\nNavistar and Tatra.\nTatra and Navistar Defence introduced at Eurosatory Exposition in Paris, France (Jun 14\u201318, 2010), the results of their strategic alliance since October 2009, the models ATX6 (universal container carrier) and ATX8 (troop carrier). The vehicles appear to be based on Tatra 815-7 (T817) 6\u00d76, 8\u00d78 chassis, suspension and cabins while using Navistar engines and other components. Under the deal Navistar Defence and Tatra A.S. will market the vehicles in North America, which includes sales to the United States military and foreign military sales financed by the United States government. Tatra will source parts and components through Navistar's global parts and support network for Tatra trucks delivered in markets outside of North America, as well as market Navistar-Tatra vehicles around the world in their primary markets.\nOwnership.\nThe Terex Corporation, an American company, acquired the majority ownership (71%) of Tatra in late 2003. As of late 2006, however, majority ownership (80.51%) was in the hands of Tatra Holdings s.r.o., an international consortium comprising Vectra Limited of the UK, Sam Eyde of the U.S., KBC Private Equity of Belgium, Meadowhill s.r.o. of the Czech Republic, and Ronald Adams of the U.S. On 15 December 2006, a contract was signed between Tatra and the Czech Republic for 556 trucks at roughly $130 million, or 2.6 billion Czech crowns. This contract was signed instead of the replacement of older military vehicles.\nIn April 2007, Tatra announced that it had already matched its production in 2006 and produced 1,600 vehicles. In 2007, Tatra planned to produce between 2,300 and 2,500 vehicles. In contrast to previous years, Tatra has increased employment by the hundreds within the past two quarters, has reversed previous errors, and was growing again.\nIn August 2011, DAF Trucks announced it had built up a 19% stake in Tatra to tighten up cooperation between the companies. DAF's cabs and Paccar engines became the mainstay of the civilian Tatra 158 Phoenix, while DAF dealerships started selling Tatra trucks.\nIn early 2013, Tatra was facing mounting financial problems. Even though the company had sufficient orders for new trucks, manufacturing was halted as banks refused to provide further loans, and the company was facing imminent bankruptcy. In March 2013, the majority stake in Tatra was acquired by major Czech defense contractor Czechoslovak Group and Czech metallurgy company Promet Group, which provided the company with necessary financial stability. With new owners, Tatra focused its production primarily towards building specialist vehicles tailored to buyers' custom orders. While in 2013 sales amounted to 722 units, in 2023 the company plans to sell over 2,000 trucks, with future increases in sales requiring enlarging of manufacturing capacity.\nCurrent models.\nTatra mostly supplies individual, highly specialized custom-made vehicles and also sells just the backbone chassis for use in other manufacturers' trucks or specialized vehicles. The current serial production models are:\nWorldwide distribution.\nGermany.\nSeveral fire brigades and civil protection (THW), mostly in eastern Germany, are traditionally using Tatra trucks. Tatra's own conversion company, THT, builds vehicles for fire brigades and civil protection. Popular in Germany is a large Water tender and pumper based on the Tatra 815. The vehicle's water tank has a volume of 4,000 liters or more and a separate tank for foam agent. The 4\u00d74 transmission and a gear wading depth of 1.20m make it suitable for rough terrain. In German use, the vehicle is called \"TLF4000\" (Tankl\u00f6schfahrzeug 4000) and is primarily used at airports and to fight forest fires.\nIn 2021 the Bundeswehr fire brigade ordered 76 Tatra firefighting vehicles to fight forest fires (ordered by BwFuhrparkService GmbH). They are based upon the Tatra T 815-7 4\u00d74 chassis, with equipment by Austrian Rosenbauer Group.\nIndia.\nTatra had a truck-building joint venture in India called Tatra Vectra Motors Ltd, formerly called Tatra Trucks India Ltd. It is a joint venture between Tatra and the Vectra Group from England. In 2002, the company received a 1,070-truck order from the Government of India. Tatra's growing involvement in India's defense industry has been cited as an example of growing relations between the Czech Republic and India.\nIn 2009, Vectra announced a new joint venture with Russia's Kamaz to form Kamaz Vectra Motors Limited to manufacture Kamaz trucks in India. This joint venture replaced the former Tatra Vectra venture. The manufacturing plant is located in Hosur, Tamil Nadu.

The Israel Defense Forces' command was apparently quite impressed with their performance, independent air cooling, and their capabilities as military trucks in long-range raiding operations in desert terrain, and became interested in including these trucks in their arsenal. As direct purchase from Czechoslovakia was impossible due to its alignment with Israeli foes, the lore has it that Israelis used the well-paid services of Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu-led Romania, in cooperation with an American Company called ATC (American Truck Company) to purchase military trucks, including desert-equipped Tatras, leading to jokes that \"Romania has a new desert\". Current photos of various Israeli weapon systems, including SPYDER slated for India, show new Tatras as the carrier vehicles.\nA number of Tatra trucks entered service in the Israeli Army's various sectors, with the brand mark of \"American Truck Company\", under which Tatras were sold from the U.S. market and exported to Israel.\nUnited States.\n\"American Truck Company\" was a quasi-independent company set up by Terex, when they controlled Tatra, to import Tatra vehicles in both knock down kits or fully built and carry out assembly operations, repair and service, body building on chassis in the United States.

Gn\u00e1 and H\u00f3fvarpnir are attested in the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Scholarly have proposed that Gn\u00e1 is a \"goddess of fullness\" and, in the 1800s, as potentially cognate to Fama from Roman mythology. H\u00f3fvarpnir and the eight-legged steed Sleipnir have been cited examples of transcendent horses in Norse mythology.\nAttestations.\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur.

High adds that Gn\u00e1 rides the horse H\u00f3fvarpnir, and that this horse has the ability to ride through the air and atop the sea. High continues that \"once some Vanir saw her path as she rode through the air\" and that an unnamed one of these Vanir says, in verse:\n\"What flies there?\nWhat fares there?\nor moves through the air?\"\nGn\u00e1 responds in verse, in doing so providing the parentage of H\u00f3fvarpnir; the horses Hamskerpir and Gar\u00f0rofa:\n\"I fly not\nthough I fare\nand move through the air\non Hofvarpnir\nthe one whom Hamskerpir got\nwith Gardrofa.\"\nThe source for these stanzas is not provided and they are otherwise unattested. High ends his description of Gn\u00e1 by saying that \"from Gna's name comes the custom of saying that something \"gnaefir\" [looms] when it rises up high.\" In the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\", Gn\u00e1 is included among a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names.\nReception.\nRudolf Simek says that the etymology that Snorri presents in \"Gylfaginning\" for the name \"Gn\u00e1\" may not be correct, yet it is unclear what the name may otherwise mean, though Gn\u00e1 has also been etymologically theorized as a \"goddess of fullness.\" John Lindow calls the verse exchange between the Vanir and Gn\u00e1 \"strange\" and points out that it's unclear why it should specifically be the Vanir that witness Gn\u00e1 flying through the air.\nUlla Loumand cites H\u00f3fvarpnir and the eight-legged horse Sleipnir as \"prime examples\" of horses in Norse mythology as being able to \"mediate between earth and sky, between \u00c1sgar\u00f0r, Mi\u00f0gar\u00f0r and \u00datgar\u00f0r and between the world of mortal men and the underworld.\" In the 19th century, Jacob Grimm proposed a cognate in the personified rumor in Roman mythology; Fama.

{"id": "69583", "revid": "1311403252", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69583", "title": "Hl\u00edn", "text": "Norse deity\nIn Norse mythology, Hl\u00edn is a goddess associated with the goddess Frigg. Hl\u00edn appears in a poem in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson, and in kennings found in skaldic poetry. Scholars have debated whether the stanza referring to her in the \"Prose Edda\" refers to Frigg. \"Hl\u00edn\" serves as a given name in Iceland, and Hl\u00edn receives veneration in the modern era in Germanic paganism's modern extension, Heathenry.\nEtymology.\nScholars frequently explain the meaning behind the goddess's name as 'protector'. The \"Prose Edda\" section \"Gylfaginning\" derives the name from a verb found in a proverb in an obscure and otherwise unattested Old Norse proverb: \"\u00deia\u00f0an af er \u00feat or\u00f0tak at s\u00e1 er for\u00f0ask hleinir\". Scholars generally accept that the theonym \"Hl\u00edn\" derives from the verb \"hleina\". However, the verb \"hleina\" in which the section claims a derivation is obscure (a \"hapax legomenon\"), and translators have attempted to work around it in a variety of manners, in some cases leaving the verb untranslated. Examples include the translations of Anthony Faulkes (\"From this comes the saying that someone who escapes finds refuge (\"hleinir\")\", 1995 [1987]) and Jesse Byock (\"From her name comes the expression that he who escapes finds \"hleinir\" [peace and quiet]\", 2005).\nScholars have proposed a variety of derivations for the verb. The verb is most commonly linked to Old English \"hlinian\" and \"hl\u00e6nan\", ancestors to the modern English verb \"lean\". 19th century scholars, including Jacob Grimm, linked \"hleina\" to the rare Old Norse noun \"hlynr\", meaning 'maple tree'. Grimm links this derivation to a variety of tree figures found in folklore from the modern era in northwest Europe. Joseph Hopkins (2017) comments that this derivation may deserve further investigation in light of the potential connection between the Old Norse goddess name \"Ilmr\" and the Old Norse common noun \"almr\" (Elm tree), and says that \"the potential of a protective tree goddess brings to mind a mysterious passage in the \"Prose Edda\" involving the rowan, in which the tree is referred to as [Thor's] \"bj\u01ebrg\" ['aid, help, salvation, rescue']\".\nAttestations.\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", Hl\u00edn receives a mention regarding the foretold death of the god Odin during the immense battle waged at Ragnar\u00f6k:\nThen is fulfilled Hl\u00edn's\nsecond sorrow,\nwhen \u00d3\u00f0inn goes\nto fight with the wolf,\nand Beli's slayer,\nbright, against Surtr.\nThen shall Frigg's\nsweet friend fall.\nThe death of Odin (the stanza's \"second sorrow\") implies a first death. Scholars all but universally view this as a reference to the death of the god Baldr, Frigg and Odin's son. Some translators replace the reference of Hl\u00edn to a mention of Frigg due to their interpretations of the stanza (see discussion in \"Scholarly reception and interpretation\" section below).\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", Hl\u00edn is listed twelfth among a series of sixteen goddesses. High tells Gangleri (earlier in the book described as King Gylfi in disguise) that Hl\u00edn \"is given the function of protecting people whom Frigg wishes to save from some danger.\" High continues that, from this, comes the saying that \"someone who escapes finds refuge (\"hleinar\").\" The verb \"hleina\" in this passage is obscure and has yielded a variety of translations (see \"etymology\" section above).\nIn chapter 51, the above-mentioned \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" stanza is quoted. In chapter 75 of the book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" Hl\u00edn appears within a list of 27 \u00e1synjur names.\nIn skaldic poetry, the name Hl\u00edn is frequent in kennings for women. Examples include \"Hl\u00edn hringa\" ('Hl\u00edn of rings'), \"Hl\u00edn go\u00f0vefjar\" ('Hl\u00edn of velvet') and \"arm-Hl\u00edn\" ('arm-Hl\u00edn'). The name is already used frequently in this way by the 10th-century poet Korm\u00e1kr \u00d6gmundarson and remains current in skaldic poetry through the following centuries, employed by poets such as \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0r Kolbeinsson, Gizurr \u00deorvaldsson and Einarr Gilsson. The name remained frequently used in woman kennings in r\u00edmur poetry, sometimes as L\u00edn.\nIn a verse in \"H\u00e1var\u00f0ar saga \u00cdsfir\u00f0ings\", the phrase \"\u00e1 Hl\u00edn fallinn\" (\"fallen on Hl\u00edn\") occurs. Some editors have emended the line while others have accepted the reading and taken Hl\u00edn to refer to the earth.\nModern influence.\nIn line with a cultural practice to use Old Norse theonyms as personal names, \"Hl\u00edn\" appears as a given name for females in Iceland. Like other goddesses from the North Germanic corpus, Hl\u00edn receives veneration in Heathenry.\nScholarly reception and interpretation.\nAlthough the \"Prose Edda\" identifies Hl\u00edn as a separate goddess than Frigg, many scholars identify Hl\u00edn as another name for Frigg. For example, Andy Orchard says that in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", Hl\u00edn appears to be just another name for Frigg, and adds that \"the numerous occurrences of the name in skaldic poetry in poetic periphrases or kennings for women do nothing to dispel the confusion.\" Rudolf Simek agrees that Hl\u00edn seems to appear as another name for Frigg in \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\", and that in skaldic poetry Hl\u00edn was a well-known mythological figure by the 10th century. Simek states that Hl\u00edn is likely simply another name for Frigg, and that Snorri \"misunderstood her to be a goddess in her own right in his reading of the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" stanza.\"\nHowever, in the same work, Simek also says that the goddesses S\u00e1ga, Hl\u00edn, Sj\u00f6fn, Snotra, V\u00e1r, and V\u00f6r should be considered vaguely defined figures who \"should be seen as female protective goddesses\" that are all responsible for \"specific areas of the private sphere, and yet clear differences were made between them so that they are in many ways similar to matrons.\"\nSome scholars express uncertainty at identifying Hl\u00edn as another name for Frigg, and others reject the identification altogether. In a 2017 paper on the topic, Hopkins agrees with Simek's comparison to the matrons and compares the scholarly reception of the goddess Fulla, another goddess closely associated with Frigg, to that of Hl\u00edn:\n\"Like Hl\u00edn, the name \"Fulla\" ['full, bountiful'] may be tempting to dismiss as a reading error on the part of a \"Prose Edda\" author or as a poetic invention ... Were it not for the preservation of the cognate theonym Volla in the Second Merseburg Charm, Fulla would remain in a similarly ambiguous position like that of Hl\u00edn, easily overlooked, dismissed, or deconstructed ... the correlations between the \"Prose Edda\" and the Second Merseburg Incantation provide something of a cautionary tale: namely, by dismissing information found solely in the \"Prose Edda\", one risks violating the foundational maxim of \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\". There is no reason to doubt that Hl\u00edn was an independent entity in Old Norse mythology and no positive evidence to suggest that Hl\u00edn was merely a by-name of Frigg.\"\nReferencing the iconography of the early Germanic matrons, Hopkins proposes an alternate reading of the \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" stanza in line with the \"Gylfaginning\" description of the goddess. In Hopkins's reading of the stanza, Hl\u00edn's sorrows are her inability to protect figures close to Frigg: the first sorrow would therefore be the death of Baldr, and the second sorrow the foretold death of Odin.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was founded by Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano (1596\u20131656), an Italian military commander who was the fifth son of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy. His descendants were accepted as \"princes \u00e9trangers\" at the court of France, where some held prominent positions. Upon the extinction of the main Savoy line, they eventually came to reign as kings of Sardinia from 1831 to 1861, and as kings of Italy from 1861 until the dynasty's deposition in 1946. The Savoy-Carignano family also briefly supplied a king each to Spain and Croatia, as well as queens consort to Bulgaria and Portugal.\nOrigin.\nBorn in Turin, Thomas Francis of Savoy was the youngest of the five legitimate sons of Charles Emmanuel I, sovereign Duke of Savoy, by his wife, Catherine Micaela of Spain (daughter of King Philip II of Spain and his consort, Elizabeth of Valois, a French princess). While still a young man, he bore arms in Italy in the service of the king of Spain.\nAlthough in previous reigns younger sons of Savoy had been granted rich appanages in Switzerland (Genevois and Vaud), Italy (Aosta), or France (Nemours and Bresse), the Savoy dukes found that this inhibited their own aggrandizement while encouraging intra-dynastic strife and regional secession. Not only did Thomas Francis have older brothers but he was just one of the twenty-one acknowledged children of Charles Emmanuel. While only nine of these were legitimate, the others, being the widowed duke's offspring by noble mistresses, appear to have been generously endowed or dowered during their father's lifetime.\nThe fief of Carignano had belonged to the Savoys since 1418, and the fact that it was part of the Principality of Piedmont, only twenty kilometers south of Turin, meant that it could be a princedom for Thomas in name only, being endowed neither with independence nor revenues of substance. Instead of receiving a significant patrimony, Thomas was wed in 1625 to Marie de Bourbon, sister and co-heiress of Louis, Count of Soissons, who would be killed in 1641 while fomenting rebellion against Cardinal Richelieu.\nFrance.\nIn anticipation of this inheritance, Thomas Francis and Marie did not establish themselves at his brother's ducal capital, Turin, but dwelt in Paris, where Marie enjoyed the exalted rank of a \"princesse du sang\", being a second cousin of King Louis XIII. It was arranged that Thomas Francis, as son of a reigning monarch, would hold the rank of first among the \"princes \u00e9trangers\" at the French court\u2014taking precedence even before the formerly all-powerful House of Guise, whose kinship to the sovereign Duke of Lorraine was more remote.\nThomas Francis was appointed \"Grand Ma\u00eetre\" of the king's household, briefly replacing the traitorous \"Grand Cond\u00e9\". He engaged the services of the distinguished grammarian and courtier Claude Favre de Vaugelas as tutor for his children. The prospect of Marie's eventual succession to the Swiss principality of Neuch\u00e2tel, near Savoy, was foiled in 1643 by the king's decision to legitimate Louis Henri de Bourbon, \"chevalier\" de Soissons (1640\u20131703), a son of Marie's late brother. Although this prevented the substitution of Savoyard for French influence in that region, it left Thomas with little more than the empty title of prince de Carignan. Marie eventually inherited her brother's main holding in France, the county of Soissons; this would be established as a secundogeniture for the French branch of the family. After Thomas Francis, the senior branch of his descendants repatriated to Savoy, alternately marrying French, Italian, and German princesses.\nService with Spain.\nThe first recorded military service of Thomas Francis is as a commander in the Savoyard army under his father against France during the War of the Mantuan Succession in 1630. Cardinal Mazarin induced him to become in effect a French agent at the Savoyard court between 1630 and 1632. When the new Duke Victor Amadeus I was forced to accept French occupation of Pinerolo in the Peace of Cherasco in 1631, there was widespread dissatisfaction in Savoy, and Thomas Francis, with his brother, Prince Maurice, withdrew from the duchy to join the forces of Spain, prompting Victor Amadeus to confiscate his uncles' Italian revenues. Although his kinship to both the French and Spanish royal families suggested that he could be useful to Spanish interests, Thomas Francis was not entirely trusted, and was obliged to send his wife and children to Madrid as hostages.\nWhen France launched the Franco-Spanish War (1635\u20131659), Thomas Francis served under the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, brother of Philip IV in the Spanish Netherlands. Savoy was reluctantly dragged into the fighting alongside the French, consequently Thomas Francis was strictly fighting against his own homeland. He was completely defeated and his army entirely killed, captured, or scattered\u2014the first in an unbroken career of military defeats. He managed to rally the remnants at Namur, then retreated before the numerically superior French and Dutch forces, and he probably served the rest of the campaign with Ferdinand. In 1636, Thomas Francis served with the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand who organised a joint Spanish-Imperialist army for a major invasion of France from the Spanish Netherlands. The invasion was initially very successful, and seemed capable of reaching Paris, where there was a great panic; if Ferdinand and Thomas had pushed on, they might have ended the war at this point. Instead, they both felt that continuing to Paris was too risky, so they stopped the advance. Later in the campaign, Thomas had problems with the Imperialist general Ottavio Piccolomini, who refused to accept orders from the Prince as a Spanish commander, arguing that his Imperialist troops were an independent force. In this year, when his brother-in-law Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons, fled from France after his failed conspiracy against Cardinal Richelieu, Thomas Francis acted as intermediary between Soissons and the Spanish in negotiations which led to a formal alliance between the count and Philip IV of Spain concluded 28 June 1637, although within a month Soissons had reconciled with France. In 1638, Thomas served in Spanish Flanders, helping to defend the fortress-city of Saint-Omer against a French siege.\nPiedmontese Civil War.\nAfter seeking Spanish support late in 1638 for action against the Regent Christine of Savoy, \"Madame Royale\", Thomas went to Milan early in 1639, and alongside Spanish forces invaded Piedmont, where many towns welcomed him. He took Turin by knavery but the French continued to control its citadel. In 1640, he held the city in the multi-layered siege of Turin. After repeated bouts of negotiations with the Regent and the French, Thomas Francis made peace with both in the first half of 1642, unblushingly changed sides, and started fighting with the French against the Spaniards.\nService with France.\nFor the rest of 1642 and part of the 1643 campaigns, Thomas Francis commanded Savoyard forces fighting alongside the French under Henri II d'Orl\u00e9ans, duc de Longueville, against the Spanish, generally along the Piedmont\u2013Milan border; when Longueville was recalled home, he succeeded him as allied commander-in-chief, with Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, as his second-in-command. Thomas Francis was given the supreme command only because of his birth; another French general, C\u00e9sar de Choiseul du Plessis Praslin, observed a few years later that French marshals would only serve under someone who was superior to them in social rank, and Thomas Francis, with his blood relationship to the French and Spanish royal families, was the only candidate.\nBy late summer, both Thomas Francis and Turenne were seriously ill and du Plessis Praslin was in temporary command. Thomas Francis led the joint armies again in 1644, taking Santya and Asti; he also tried to take Finale Ligure but gave up the attempt, apparently because he feared this valuable port would end up under French control rather than Savoyard. In 1645, now commanding with du Plessis Praslin, he took Vigevano, and repulsed a Spanish attempt to block his withdrawal at the River Mora, the nearest he ever came to a success in the field. In 1646, Thomas Francis was put in command of the French expedition sent south to take the Tuscan forts, after which he was to advance further south to Naples, drive out the Spanish and put himself on the throne of the kingdom; but the expedition set off late, and when he besieged Orbetello, the supporting French fleet was defeated by the Spanish and he was forced to raise the siege and conduct a difficult retreat, which he performed poorly. In the 1647 campaign, Thomas Francis is mentioned as commanding alongside the French general in the forces sent across north Italy to work with the Duke of Modena Francesco I d'Este who had just allied with France and opened up a 'second front' against the Spaniards in Milan, though Mazarin confessed that he had appointed Thomas only because he feared that, if left behind in Piedmont, the Prince's restless spirit would make more trouble.\nDuring his absence, Regent Christine had gained control of the fortresses granted to Thomas Francis as part of the settlement of the Piedmontese Civil War (legally, these reverted to ducal control when the Duke came of age, which under Savoyard law Charles Emmanuel did in 1648, though his mother remained in control of the government; Christine, accompanied by her son and part of the ducal army, entered Ivrea and dismissed Thomas' personal garrison; she appointed Thomas Francis instead as governor or Asti and Alba, positions which sweetened the blow but were entirely under ducal control, not guaranteed by treaty. When he returned to Piedmont, Thomas had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, and soon after this he went to live in Paris. During the Fronde, Thomas Francis linked himself closely with Cardinal Mazarin who, although effectively chief minister of France, was like him an Italian outsider at the French court. In the early 1650s, Thomas Francis was seen as an important member of Mazarin's party, closely linked to the Cardinal, regularly seen in conference with him, and active in his support. In 1651 when Mazarin had been forced into exile, the Prince was for a time brought onto the \"conseil du roi\", and an admittedly very hostile contemporary Marie de Nemours, the Duchess of Nemours, described him as a \"prime minister without being aware of it\". There were suggestions that Mazarin's opponents within the court had raised him up as a rival to the cardinal with the Queen Regent Anne of Austria; this is unlikely, especially since Mazarin himself urged the Queen to follow Thomas' advice, and it is more probable that Mazarin backed the Prince as someone who would keep other rivals from gaining control in his absence but who would never have the status within France to set himself up as a permanent replacement for the Cardinal. By the time Mazarin returned from his second and last exile in February 1653, Thomas Francis, who accompanied the court to St Denis to welcome the Cardinal home, was insignificant again\u2014an analysis of Mazarin's close colleagues at this time by the later historian Pierre Adolphe Ch\u00e9ruel made no mention of him.\nIn January 1654, when the last of the ceremonial offices formerly belonging to the rebel leader Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9, were disposed of, Prince Thomas Francis was made \"Grand Maitre\". The Franco-Spanish war had been continuing in north Italy, and late in 1654 the increasing Savoyard hostility to the current French commander Grancey led to a search for a new allied commander-in-chief; the French would have preferred to send the Duke of York (later King James II); as he was unacceptable to Turin, Thomas Francis was appointed as joint commander, akthough his wife was held in France almost as a hostage for his good behaviour. On 16 December 1654, he arrived in Turin to a ceremonial welcome by the French troops and an unexpectedly friendly reception by Duke Charles Emmanuel. After the 1655 campaign, Thomas Francis returned to Turin where he died the following January.\nSecond generation.\nAmong the children of Prince Thomas Francis and Marie de Bourbon-Soissons were:\nSubsequent generations.\nThe subsequent Princes of Carignano, with their respective dates of tenure in brackets, were as follows:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He engaged the services of the distinguished grammarian and courtier Claude Favre de Vaugelas as tutor for his children.\nThe prospect of Marie's eventual succession to the Swiss principality of Neuch\u00e2tel, near Savoy, was foiled in 1643 by the king's decision to legitimate Louis Henri de Bourbon, \"chevalier\" de Soissons (1640\u20131703), a son of Marie's late brother. This prevented the substitution of Savoyard for French influence in that region, but left Thomas with little more than the empty title of \"prince de Carignano\". Marie did eventually inherit her brother's main holding in France, the county of Soissons, but this would be established as a secundogeniture for the French branch of the family. After Thomas, the senior branch of his descendants repatriated to Savoy, alternately marrying French, Italian and German princesses.\nPublic career.\nEarly actions and service with Spain.\nThomas' first recorded service is as a commander in the Piedmontese army under his father in the war against France in 1630 (see War of the Mantuan Succession). It was probably around this time that he first encountered Mazarin, who (though his public position was quite complex) was during 1630\u201332 in effect a French agent at the Piedmontese court. When the new Duke Victor Amadeus I was forced to accept a French occupation of Pinerolo (Peace of Cherasco, 26 April 1631, and associated secret agreements, implemented 1632), there was widespread dissatisfaction in Piedmont, and Thomas, with his brother Maurice, went to join the Spanish, at which Victor Amadeus confiscated their revenues. (The exact date of the move is unstated, but was probably 1632, certainly no later than 1634.) Though welcomed by the Spanish given that he was related to both the French and Spanish royal families, Thomas was not entirely trusted by them, and had to send his wife and children to Madrid as hostages.\nSpain, during the burst of confidence after its unexpected great victory at Nordlingen in 1634, made plans for major operations in Germany to end the war against the Protestants there and in the Netherlands; these plans included Thomas leading an army in Westphalia, under the overall command of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand, brother of Philip IV. Nothing came of this, but in 1635, when France declared war on Spain (Franco-Spanish war of 1635\u201359), Thomas served under Ferdinand in the Spanish Netherlands: he was given command of a small army (variously given as 8,500 or 13,000) sent against French forces that had advanced into Luxemburg, his orders either to observe them or to prevent them from joining up with a Dutch army. On 22 May 1635 at Les Avins, south of Huy, in what was then the bishopric of Li\u00e8ge, he was defeated by the French army commanded by Breez\u00e9 and Chatillon. He managed to rally the remnants at Namur, then retreated before the numerically-superior French and Dutch forces; and he probably served the rest of the campaign with Ferdinand. Late in the year, the refugee Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine arrived in Brussels and met Thomas; they may have formed a joint court, and Thomas certainly participated in jousts organised by the Duke. (In this Franco-Spanish war, Piedmont was reluctantly dragged into the fighting alongside the French, though initially it avoided a full declaration of war; consequently, Thomas was technically fighting against his own homeland.)\nIn 1636, the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand organised a joint Spanish-Imperial army for a major invasion of France from the Spanish Netherlands, and Thomas was initially in charge, defeating the French army commanded by Soisons, at the Somme, though Ferdinand soon took over supreme command. The invasion was initially very successful, and seemed capable of reaching Paris, where there was a great panic; if Ferdinand and Thomas had pushed on, they might have ended the war at this point, but they both felt that continuing to Paris was too risky, so they stopped the advance. Later in the campaign, Thomas had problems with the Imperial general Ottavio Piccolomini, who refused to accept orders from the Prince as a Spanish commander, arguing that his Imperial troops were an independent force. Military action for Thomas is not recorded in 1637, but in this year, when his brother-in-law Soissons fled from France after his failed conspiracy against Cardinal Richelieu, he acted as intermediary between Soissons and the Spanish in negotiations which led to a formal alliance between the count and Philip IV of Spain concluded 28 June 1637 - although within a month Soissons had reconciled with France! In 1638, Thomas served in Spanish Flanders, helping to defend the fortress-city of Saint-Omer against a French siege; in mid-June, he managed to get reinforcements into the place, then with the rest of his small army entrenched about 15\u00a0km. to the north-west at Ruminghem, opposite the French army under Jacques-Nompar de Caumont, duke of La Force at Zouafques; after being joined by Imperial reinforcements under Ottavio Piccolomini, he marched to attack La Force, and was defeated with the loss of 2,000 men killed or captured (action at Zouafques, exact date unknown but around 21 June). However, he then marched back with his remaining troops to the continuing French siege of Saint-Omer, where he put in more reinforcements and then entrenched himself so securely in the vicinity that the French found it impossible to continue the siege and gave up. Thomas and Piccolimini subsequently stuck so close to La Force that the French were unable to undertake any serious operations.\nPiedmontese Civil War.\nAfter seeking Spanish support late in 1638 for action against Regent Christine Marie, \"Madame Royale\", Thomas went to Spanish Milan early in 1639, and alongside Spanish forces invaded Piedmont, where many towns welcomed him. He took Turin by trickery, but the French continued to control its citadel. In 1640, he held the city in the multi-layered siege of Turin. After repeated bouts of negotiations with the Regent and the French, Thomas made peace with both in the first half of 1642, and unblushingly changed sides and started fighting with the French against the Spaniards.\nService with France.\nFor the rest of 1642 and part of the 1643 campaigns, Thomas commanded Piedmontese forces fighting alongside the French under Henri d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Longueville against the Spanish, generally along the Piedmont/Milan border; when Longueville was recalled home, Thomas succeeded him as allied commander-in-chief, with Turenne as his second-in-command. (Thomas was given the supreme command only because of his birth; another French general, Du Plessis Praslin, noted a few years later that French marshals would only serve under someone who was superior to them in social rank, and Thomas, with his blood relationship to the French and Spanish royal families, was the only candidate.) By late summer, both Thomas and Turenne were seriously ill and Du Plessis Praslin was in temporary command. Thomas led the joint armies again in 1644, taking Santya and Asti; he also tried to take Finale Ligure, but gave up the attempt, apparently because he feared this valuable port would end up in French control rather than Piedmontese. In 1645, now commanding with Du Plessis Praslin, he took Vigevano, but was defeated at the River Mora. In 1646, Thomas was put in command of the French expedition sent south to take the Tuscan forts, after which he was to advance further south to Naples, drive out the Spanish and put himself on the throne of the kingdom; but the expedition set off late, and when he besieged Orbetello, the supporting French fleet was defeated by the Spanish and he was forced to raise the siege and conduct a difficult retreat, which he performed so poorly that Cardinal Mazarin subsequently despised his command ability, viewed him as incompetent, and declined to appoint him to the expedition that France sent to support the Naples revolt late in 1647 (this did not stop Mazarin from considering him as a potential candidate for a French-backed King of Naples, though Paris was so slow to move on this that Henry II, Duke of Guise was adopted by the Neapolitans instead). In the 1647 campaign, Thomas is mentioned as commanding alongside the French general in the forces sent across north Italy to work with the Duke of Modena Francesco I d'Este who had just allied with France and opened up a 'second front' against the Spaniards in Milan, though Mazarin confessed that he had appointed Thomas only because he feared that, if left behind in Piedmont, the Prince's restless spirit would make more trouble. By spring of 1648 however he was back in Piedmont, fighting on the Piedmont-Milan border to distract the Spanish from their pressure on Modena; in the summer, he was put in charge of an army sent on a fleet to Naples - the Naples revolt had already collapsed by then, so the expedition found no support when it landed and after some pointless actions it re-embarked, a complete failure (some details in Naples revolt). On his return with the French fleet, Thomas was delayed in Provence and unable to join the great siege of Cremona where he was expected.\nDuring his absence, Regent Christine had gained control of the fortresses granted to Thomas as part of the settlement of the Piedmontese Civil War (legally, these reverted to ducal control when the Duke came of age), which under Piedmontese law Charles Emmanuel did in 1648, though his mother remained in control of the government; Christine, accompanied by her son and part of the ducal army, entered Ivrea and dismissed Thomas' personal garrison; she appointed Thomas instead as governor or Asti and Alba, positions which sweetened the blow but were entirely under ducal control, not guaranteed by treaty. When he returned to Piedmont, Thomas had no choice but to accept the fait accompli, and soon after this he went to live in Paris.\nDuring the Fronde, Thomas linked himself closely with Cardinal Mazarin, who, although effectively prime minister of France, was like him an Italian outsider at the French court. In the early 1650s, Thomas was seen as an important member of Mazarin's party, closely linked to the Cardinal, regularly seen in conference with him, and active in his support. In 1651 when Mazarin had been forced into exile, the Prince was for a time brought onto the conseil du roi, and an (admittedly very hostile) contemporary the duchesse de Nemours described him as a 'prime minister without being aware of it'; there were suggestions that Mazarin's opponents within the court had raised him up as a rival to the cardinal with the Queen, but this is unlikely, especially since Mazarin himself urged the Queen to follow Thomas' advice, and it is more probable that Mazarin backed the Prince as someone who would keep other rivals from gaining control in his absence but who would never have the status within France to set himself up as a permanent replacement for the Cardinal. By the time Mazarin returned from his second and last exile in February 1653, Thomas, who accompanied the court to St Denis to welcome the Cardinal home, was insignificant again - an analysis of Mazarin's close colleagues at this time by the later historian Ch\u00e9ruel made no mention of him. In January 1654, when the last of the ceremonial offices formerly belonging to the rebel leader Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9 were disposed of, Prince Thomas was made Grand Maitre.\nThe Franco-Spanish war had been continuing in north Italy, and late in 1654, increasing Piedmontese hostility to the current French commander Grancey led to a search for a new allied commander-in-chief; the French would have preferred to send the Duke of York (later King James II), but he too was unacceptable to Turin, so Thomas was appointed as joint commander - though his wife was held in France almost as a hostage for his good behaviour. On 16 December 1654 he arrived in Turin, to a ceremonial welcome by the French troops and an unexpectedly friendly reception by Charles Emmanuel. On 4 April 1655 Thomas Francis commanded the Waldensians to attend Mass or remove to the upper valleys, giving them twenty days in which to sell their lands. The Duke of Savoy sent an army and on 24 April, at 4 a.m., the signal was given for a general massacre so brutal, that it aroused indignation throughout Europe. Oliver Cromwell began petitioning on behalf of the Vaudois, and John Milton wrote his famous poem about this, \"On the Late Massacre in Piedmont.\" In the 1655 campaign, he led an invasion of the Duchy of Milan, though already ill with malaria, and besieged Pavia, where the attack went so badly that he was forced to leave his sick-bed to take direct control of the siege, and even then it had to be raised after nearly two months of fruitless effort.\nDeath.\nAfter the 1655 campaign, Thomas returned to Turin where he died the following January; the suggestion in Spanheim that he died \"at\" the siege of Pavia is not supported - malaria, a common problem in the marshes of the Po valley, carried him off, as it carried off his successor as allied commander-in-chief, Francesco I d'Este.\nFamily.\nThomas and Marie de Bourbon had seven children (Italian names in parentheses):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "69587", "revid": "1319087358", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=69587", "title": "Eir", "text": "Norse deity\nIn Norse mythology, Eir (Old Norse: , \"protection, help, mercy\") is a goddess or valkyrie associated with medical skill. Eir is attested in the \"Poetic Edda\", compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the \"Prose Edda\", written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; and in skaldic poetry, including a runic inscription from Bergen, Norway from around 1300. Scholars have theorized about whether these three sources refer to the same figure, and debate whether Eir may have been originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie. In addition, Eir has been compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia.\nAttestations.\n\"Poetic Edda\".\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\" poem \"Fj\u00f6lsvinnsm\u00e1l\", the watchman Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r presents a list of the maidens that attend the lady of the keep\u2014Mengl\u00f6\u00f0\u2014that includes Eir, and states that they all sit on the hill Lyfjaberg (Old Norse \"hill of healing\" or \"healing mountain\"). The exchange between the hero Svipdagr and Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r mentioning Eir is as follows:\nAfter the exchange, Svipdagr asks if these figures will give aid if bl\u00f3t are made to them. Fj\u00f6lsvi\u00f0r responds that Svipdagr is correct:\n\"Prose Edda\".\nIn chapter 35 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Gylfaginning\", the enthroned figure of High provides brief descriptions of 16 \u00e1synjur. High lists Eir third, and says no more about her other than noting that \"she is an extremely good physician.\" In chapter 75 of the \"Prose Edda\" book \"Sk\u00e1ldskaparm\u00e1l\" Eir appears within a list of valkyrie names, but Eir is not included in the list of \u00e1synjur in the same chapter.\nSkaldic poetry and runic inscription.\nIn skaldic poetry, the name Eir is frequent in kennings for women. A sample construction is \"Eir aura\" (\"Eir of riches\"), occurring in \"G\u00edsla saga\". The name is already used in this way by the 10th century poets Korm\u00e1kr \u00d6gmundarson and Hallfre\u00f0r vandr\u00e6\u00f0ask\u00e1ld. Similarly, the name Eir is used in a woman kenning in a runic inscription inscribed on a stick from Bergen, Norway around the year 1300. The stick records a common mercantile transaction followed by a verse from a displeased scribe (edits applied per the translator's notes):\n'Wise Var of wire [\"woman of filigree,\" meaning \"wise bejeweled woman\"] makes (me) sit unhappy.\nEir [woman] of mackerels' ground [likely gold] takes often and much sleep from me.'\nMindy Macleod and Bernard Mees posit that the first line of the inscription essentially means \"women make me miserable\" or potentially \"marriage makes me miserable,\" whereas the second line means \"women often take a lot of sleep from me.\"\nThe name remained frequently used in woman kennings in r\u00edmur poetry.\nTheories.\nRegarding the seemingly three different, seemingly conflicting, mentions of Eir, Andy Orchard says that the etymology of the name \"Eir\" may appear to fit the role of Eir as a goddess and servant of Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 best, but that one should consider that the valkyries also have the ability to waken the dead. John Lindow is skeptical of there having been a belief in Eir as a goddess, stating that \"whether we should trust Snorri and imagine the existence of a goddess Eir is problematic\". Rudolf Simek says that Eir may originally have been simply a valkyrie rather than a goddess, and lists the servant of Mengl\u00f6\u00f0 by the same name as a separate figure.\nHilda Ellis Davidson comments that \"virtually nothing\" is known about Eir outside of her association with healing, and points out that she is \"singled out as one of the Norns who shape the lives of children\". Davidson adds that \"no satisfactory conclusions\" have been drawn from her name, and considers all mentions of Eir as of the same figure. Davidson says that, in reference to Eir's appearance among Mengl\u00f6\u00f0's maidens, that the names of these maidens \"suggest that they are guardian spirits, and [they are] said to 'shelter and save' those who make offerings of them. They could be akin to protective spirits of the house, guarding both men and women.\" She additionally draws a link between these spirits and Lyfjaberg:\nLyfjaberg is where the goddess sits surrounded by her helpful spirits. Although healing by a goddess\u2014or indeed by a god either\u2014has left little mark on Norse myths as they have come down to us, there is no doubt that the healing power of goddesses was of enormous importance in daily life in the pre-Christian period, as was that of many women saints in Christian times. The goddess who presided over childbirth was held to possess power over life and death, and was revered as a lifegiver, both in the family home and in the courts of kings, though she might also pass sentence of death.\nHenry Adams Bellows proposes a relationship between Eir and the place name \"Lyfjaberg\", which he translates as \"hill of healing\". Bellows notes that manuscripts vary about the spelling of the place name, and that he, like others, has followed 19th-century scholar Sophus Bugge's choice. Bellows states that the stanza mentioning Lyfjaberg \"implies that Mengloth is a goddess of healing, and hence, perhaps an hypostasis of Frigg, as already intimated by her name [...]. In stanza 54, Eir appears as one of Mengloth's handmaidens, and Eir, according to Snorri (\"Gylfaginning, 35\") is herself the Norse Hygieia. Compare this stanza to stanza 32.\"\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Gambia has a mixed economy with a heavy reliance on agriculture, combined with relatively weak centralized economic planning and government regulation. Before 2017 the Gambia had a under Yahya Jammeh liberal, market-based economy characterised by traditional subsistence agriculture, a historic reliance on groundnuts (peanuts) for export earnings, a re-export trade built up around its ocean port, low import duties, minimal administrative procedures, a fluctuating exchange rate with no exchange controls, and a significant tourism industry. The Gambia also has no significant mineral or other natural resources, and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population depends on crops and livestock for its livelihood. Small-scale manufacturing activity features the processing of peanuts, fish, and animal hides.\nShort-run economic progress remains highly dependent on foreign aid, and on responsible government economic management as forwarded by International Monetary Fund technical help and advice.\nEconomic history.\nhttp:// of the Gambia registered a peak growth of 23.3% in the 1970s. Economic growth slowed by 8.30% in the 1980s and a further 5.20% in the 1990s.\nRe-export trade normally constitutes a major segment of economic activity, but the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 made Senegalese goods more competitive and hurt the re-export trade. The Gambia has benefited from a rebound in tourism after its decline in response to the military's takeover in July 1994. Lately, Indian global health expert Dr Edmond Fernandes stated that Gambia presents a global investment opportunity and dissected various areas of business interests.\nMacro-economic trend.\nThis is a chart of trend of gross domestic product of Gambia at market prices estimated by the International Monetary Fund with figures in millions of Dalasi (currency used in Gambia).\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US dollar is exchanged at 4.35 Dalasi only.\nThe Gambia's economy is characterized by traditional subsistence agriculture, a historic reliance on peanuts or groundnuts for export earnings, a re-export trade built up around its ocean port, low import duties, minimal administrative procedures, a fluctuating exchange rate with no exchange controls, and a significant tourism industry. Average wages in 2007 hover around $1\u20132 per day.\nEconomic sectors.\nAgriculture.\nAgriculture accounts for 23% of gross domestic product (GDP) and employs 75% of the labor force. Within agriculture, peanut production accounts for 5.3% of GDP, other crops 8.3%, livestock 4.4%, fishing 1.8%, and forestry 0.5%.\nIndustry.\nIndustry accounts for 12% of GDP. Manufacturing accounts for 6% of GDP. The limited amount of manufacturing is primarily agriculturally based (e.g., peanut processing, bakeries, a brewery, and a tannery). Other manufacturing activities include soap, soft drinks, and clothing. Services account for 19% of GDP.\nTourism.\nTourism in Gambia has three major strands. There is the traditional sun seeking holiday making use of the hot climate and wonderful beaches. The Gambia is also usually the first African destination for many European birders, due to its easily accessed and spectacular avian fauna. There are also a significant number of African Americans tracing their roots in this country, from which many Africans were taken during the slave trade. While not that many American slaves came from Gambia it was made popular by Alex Haleys historic novel and TV miniseries \nThe tourist season is the dry season, during the Northern Hemisphere winter.\nTrade.\nIn 2020 The Gambia's major export markets were Senegal, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, India and China, accounting for 84% of all exports. Neighboring Senegal accounted for 50.5% of exports. This contrasted with 1999 when the UK and other EU countries were The Gambia's major domestic export markets, accounting for 86% of all exports.\nIn 2020 Norway, China, Cote d'Ivoire, Brazil and Turkey were the major sources of imports, accounting for 49% of the total.
