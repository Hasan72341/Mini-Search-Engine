It was produced by Springsteen, Jon Landau, Steven Van Zandt, and Chuck Plotkin, and recorded in New York City with the E Street Band over two years between January 1982 and March 1984. Some of the songs originated from the demo tape from Springsteen's previous album \"Nebraska\" (1982). The recording sessions yielded between 70 and 90 songs; some were released as B-sides, others saw release on compilation albums, while a number remain unreleased.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\"'s sound is more pop-influenced than Springsteen's earlier albums. Its production is typical of mainstream 1980s rock music, with heavy use of synthesizers and a prominent snare drum. The lyrics contrast with the album's lively sound and continue the themes explored on previous records, particularly \"Nebraska\". Topics include working-class struggles, disillusionment, patriotism, and personal relationships, although some tracks contain humorous lyrics. The cover photograph of Springsteen from behind against a backdrop of the American flag has appeared on lists of the best album covers.\nThe album was launched with an extensive promotional campaign that included seven singles, five music videos, and three dance remixes. It was a worldwide commercial success and became the best-selling album of 1985, topping the charts in nine countries, including the U.S. and the U.K. All of the singles, including \"Dancing in the Dark\", \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"I'm on Fire\", and \"Glory Days\", reached the U.S. top ten. The album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it Springsteen's best-selling album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. On its release, critics praised the album's storytelling and musical performances. Springsteen and the E Street Band supported the album on the worldwide Born in the U.S.A. Tour (1984\u20131985).\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" transformed Springsteen into a worldwide superstar. The album helped to popularize American heartland rock and influenced later artists who wanted to mimic its power and impact. In later decades, publications such as \"Rolling Stone\" and \"NME\" ranked it as one of Springsteen's best albums and of all time. \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012. However, Springsteen later expressed reservations about the album and the fame it brought him, and the lessons from its success have since influenced his career path and musical choices.\nBackground.\nFollowing the conclusion of the River Tour in September 1981, Bruce Springsteen rented a ranch in Colts Neck, New Jersey, While there, he wrote new material, including the song \"Vietnam\" about a Vietnam veteran returning to an apathetic community. During the tour, Springsteen had read \"Born on the Fourth of July\", a 1976 autobiography by Ron Kovic, an anti-war activist who was wounded and paralyzed during the Vietnam War. Kovic's story inspired Springsteen to meet with veterans of the war in Los Angeles, which in turn inspired several tracks that center on themes about the Vietnam War, including \"Vietnam\", \"Shut Out the Light\", \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)\", \"Highway Patrolman\", and \"Brothers Under the Bridges\".\nAs Springsteen developed \"Vietnam\", the director Paul Schrader asked him to write music for a planned (but ultimately abandoned) film \"Born in the U.S.A.\" The screenplay centered on a Cleveland factory worker who plays guitar in a bar band at night. Springsteen revised the lyrics and music of \"Vietnam\", using the film's title to create \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Schrader eventually made the film but retitled it \"Light of Day\", which was released in 1987; Springsteen provided its title song.\nUsing a four-track tape recorder, Springsteen demoed tracks written in the bedroom of his Colts Neck house between December 17, 1981, and January 3, 1982. These included \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Nebraska\", \"Atlantic City\", \"Mansion on the Hill\", \"Downbound Train\", and \"Child Bride\". Between February and March, Springsteen demoed further tracks, including \"Wages of Sin\", \"Your Love is All Around Me\", \"Baby I'm So Cold\", and \"Fade to Black\".\nRecording history.\nInitial sessions and \"Nebraska\".\nIn late January 1982, weeks after recording the demos in Colts Neck, Springsteen and the E Street Band \u2013 Roy Bittan (piano), Clarence Clemons (saxophone), Danny Federici (organ), Garry Tallent (bass), Steven Van Zandt (guitar), and Max Weinberg (drums) \u2013 were at the Hit Factory in New York City recording a session for Gary U.S. Bonds' album \"On the Line\", for which Springsteen had written seven songs and was co-producing with Van Zandt. During the session, the band recorded \"Cover Me\", a song Springsteen had written for Donna Summer. His manager-producer Jon Landau convinced Springsteen to keep it for his next album after hearing the finished recording; Springsteen subsequently wrote Summer another song, \"Protection\", and likewise recorded a version of that song with the E Street Band.\nIn April, Springsteen and the E Street Band regrouped at the Power Station in New York City, where \"The River\" (1980) had been recorded. There, he attempted to rerecord some of the Colts Neck demos as full-band versions for release on the next album. Production was handled by Springsteen, Landau, Van Zandt, and \"The River\"'s mixer Chuck Plotkin, while Toby Scott returned from the Hit Factory sessions as engineer. The band spent two weeks attempting full-band arrangements of the Colts Neck tracks, including \"Nebraska\", \"Johnny 99\", and \"Mansion on the Hill\", but Springsteen and his co-producers were dissatisfied with the recordings. Plotkin has described the performances with E Street as \"less meaningful... less compelling... less honest\" than the demo recordings.\nOther songs from the tape, including \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Downbound Train\", \"Child Bride\" (now rewritten as \"Working on the Highway\"), and \"Pink Cadillac\", proved successful in full-band arrangements. According to the author Dave Marsh, the night the band recorded \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was when \"they knew they'd really begun making an album\". Over the next few weeks into May, the band's productivity increased as they recorded material absent from the Colts Neck tape, including \"Darlington County\", \"Frankie\", \"Glory Days\", \"I'm Goin' Down\", \"I'm on Fire\", \"Johnny Bye-Bye\", \"Murder Incorporated\", \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\", \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)\", \"This Hard Land\", \"None but the Brave\", and \"Wages of Sin\". A new recording of \"Cover Me\" was also made. According to Weinberg, these sessions featured little rehearsal as the band went through songs without knowing them fully, often in fewer than five takes.\nDespite the band's productivity and excitement about the recorded material, Springsteen remained focused on the rest of the Colts Neck songs. Realizing the tracks would not work in full-band arrangements, he decided to release the demos as is. Springsteen briefly considered releasing a double album of acoustic and electric songs before deciding to release the acoustic ones on their own to give them \"greater stature\". The album, \"Nebraska\", was released in September 1982. It featured nine songs from the original demo tape, and \"My Father's House\", recorded at Colts Neck in late May. The album sold well, reaching number three in the U.S. and the U.K. charts. According to the pop culture scholar Gillian G. Gaar, music critics praised the album as \"a brave artistic statement\". Springsteen did not promote the album; he conducted no interviews and, for the first time after an album release, did not tour, instead vacationing on a cross-country road trip to California.\nFurther demos and continued sessions.\nIn late 1982, Springsteen and his guitar tech Mike Batlan built an eight-track studio in the former's new Los Angeles home. There, he spent time recording new demos that were similar in style to \"Nebraska\", albeit with a drum machine. Songs demoed from January to April 1983 include \"Shut Out the Light\", \"Johnny Bye-Bye\", \"Cynthia\", \"Unsatisfied Heart\", \"Sugarland\", \"The Klansman\", \"My Hometown\", \"Delivery Man\", and \"Follow That Dream\", a reworking of the 1962 Elvis Presley single of the same name. Like the \"Nebraska\" tracks, Springsteen felt the new material would not work in a band setting. While he considered releasing another solo acoustic album, he ultimately dismissed the idea. During this period, Springsteen made numerous lifestyle changes, including therapy and working on his physique with a weight-training program. At the end of April, he departed California and traveled back to New York to record more material with the E Street Band.\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band reconvened at the Hit Factory between May and June 1983. The sessions included re-recordings of recently demoed solo material (\"Cynthia\" and \"My Hometown\"), as well as new tracks such as \"Pink Cadillac\", \"Car Wash\", \"TV Movie\", \"Stand on It\", and \"County Fair\". These were the first sessions without Van Zandt, who departed the E Street Band in June the year prior and had started a solo career, performing under the name Little Steven. According to the author Fred Goodman, Van Zandt departed due to personal clashes with Landau, although other sources state Van Zandt had felt trapped in the E Street Band and was ready to perform solo. By the summer of 1983, Van Zandt was touring supporting his second solo album, \"Voice of America\". Springsteen's friendship with Van Zandt inspired two new songs, \"Bobby Jean\" and \"No Surrender\".\nBy July 1983, Springsteen and his co-producers had over fifty tracks to choose from for the album, tentatively titled \"Murder Incorporated\". The recorded tracks encompassed numerous styles, including R&amp;B (\"Lion's Den\", \"Pink Cadillac\"), rockabilly (\"Stand on It\", \"Delivery Man\"), hard rock (\"Murder Incorporated\", \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\"), and country and folk (\"This Hard Land\", \"County Fair\", \"None but the Brave\"). At the end of July, Springsteen asked Plotkin to develop a rough mix of the album that included \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Glory Days\", \"My Hometown\", \"Downbound Train\", \"Follow That Dream\", \"Shut Out the Light\", \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\", and \"Sugarland\". Plotkin dismissed the tentative list as \"a conceptual mess\"; he felt the album should begin with \"Born in the U.S.A.\", end with \"My Hometown\", and include \"Working on the Highway\" and \"I'm on Fire\".\nFinal recording and mixing.\nSpringsteen was still unhappy with the recordings as the sessions continued into the new year. Mixing began with Bob Clearmountain, who had mixed \"The River\"'s \"Hungry Heart\". The band recorded \"Bobby Jean\" and \"No Surrender\" in October 1983, and that November put down \"Brothers Under the Bridge\" and other unreleased songs, including \"Shut Down\" and \"100 Miles From Jackson\". Landau had grown tired of the prolonged recording sessions but remained supportive of Springsteen's vision. By December, Springsteen and his co-producers had tentatively settled on \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Glory Days\", \"Downbound Train\", and \"This Hard Land\" as final choices for inclusion. \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was decided upon as the album title by January 1984. The same month, the band recorded \"Rockaway the Days\" and \"Man at the Top\".\nBy February, Landau still felt the album was missing a lead single good enough to break Springsteen into the mainstream. After arguments with his producer, Springsteen introduced \"Dancing in the Dark\" the following day. The sessions ended in March. Springsteen struggled with the final track-list, but was convinced by Landau and Plotkin to stick with a selection of material largely from the May 1982 sessions. He wrote in his 2016 autobiography \"Born to Run\" that he had \"recorded a lot of music... But in the end, I circled back to my original groups of songs. There I found a naturalism and aliveness that couldn't be argued with.\" He had selected eleven songs by that April. When Van Zandt heard the final track listing, he urged Springsteen to include \"No Surrender\", as he felt it acted as a bridge between Springsteen's earlier and current works. Springsteen complied, bringing the final track count to twelve. The album was mastered by Bob Ludwig at Masterdisk in New York City.\nOuttakes.\nAfter over two years of recording, the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" sessions yielded between 70 and 90 songs. Five were released as B-sides between 1984 and 1985: \"Pink Cadillac\", \"Shut Out the Light\", \"Johnny Bye-Bye\", \"Stand on It\", and \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart\". All five later appeared on the 1998 compilation album \"Tracks\". Other outtakes that appeared on \"Tracks\" included \"A Good Man Is Hard to Find (Pittsburgh)\", \"Wages of Sin\", \"Cynthia\", \"My Love Will Not Let You Down\", \"This Hard Land\", \"Frankie\", \"TV Movie\", \"Lion's Den\", \"Car Wash\", \"Rockaway the Days\", \"Brothers under the Bridge\" (titled \"Brothers Under the Bridges '83\"), and \"Man at the Top\". \"Murder Incorporated\" was released on \"Greatest Hits\" (1995), while \"County Fair\" and \"None but the Brave\" appeared on the limited edition bonus disc of \"The Essential Bruce Springsteen\" (2003).\nThe songs recorded in early 1983 in Springsteen's Los Angeles home that had previously appeared on bootlegs were officially released in June 2025 as part of the box set \"\". Titled \"LA Garage Sessions '83\", the album features eighteen songs including \"Sugarland\", \"Richfield Whistle\", \"Don't Back Down\", \"Follow That Dream\", \"Fugitive's Dream\", \"Seven Tears\", \"One Love\", and \"The Klansman\".\nMusic and themes.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" is a rock and roll, heartland rock, and pop album, with elements of folk and rockabilly. The album's sound and production are characteristic of mid-1980s mainstream rock, featuring prominent synthesizers, \"slamming\" guitars, \"massive\" drums, and \"front-and-center\" vocals. A number of contemporary reviewers noted that although Springsteen added electronic textures he retained his rock and roll roots. According to the author Geoffrey Himes, the album is unified by \"pop pleasure\", and that songs such as \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"Glory Days\", \"Dancing in the Dark\", \"I'm Goin' Down\", and \"I'm on Fire\" were earworms, featuring melodies and rhythms that \"resonated with emotions as basic as lust, loneliness, anger, and yearning and gave them shape\". Most of the songs are built around only two or three chords.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMy \"Born in the U.S.A.\" songs were direct and fun and stealthily carried the undercurrents of \"Nebraska\".\n\u2014Bruce Springsteen, \"Born to Run\", 2016\nCritics have described a progression of the characters and their struggles on \"Born in the U.S.A.\" from those on his previous albums. AllMusic's William Ruhlmann argues that following their journeys through Springsteen's first six albums, from being passionate youths to centering their attention on work life to feeling discouragement on \"Nebraska\", the characters on his seventh album were alive with a resolve to succeed. For the author Peter Ames Carlin, both \"Nebraska\" and \"Born in the U.S.A.\" describe troubled times, but on the latter there is more focus on themes including love and on seeking some kind of happiness. Springsteen's characters on the album are married, in their mid-'30s, and dealing with parenthood and recession. Ruhlmann and others have heard humor on \"Born in the U.S.A.\" or in its characters; like Carlin, \"Consequence of Sound\"'s Gabriel Fine identifies overlapping thematic elements with \"Nebraska\", such as working-class characters who face life challenges, but notes that humor distinguishes \"Born in the U.S.A.\" from its predecessor. By contrast, the main theme throughout \"Born in the U.S.A.\" for Stephen Holden is \"the decline of small-town working class life in a post-industrial society\". Holden opines that against the mostly upbeat music is \"a sad and serious album about the end of the American dream \u2013 of economic hope and security, and of community \u2013 for a dwindling segment of our society.\"\nSide one.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" is an energetic, rock and roll protest song driven by synthesizer and pounding drums. The track dissects the mistreatment of Vietnam veterans upon their return home after the war. Its message is widely regarded as misunderstood, as many Americans, including president Ronald Reagan, interpreted it as a patriotic anthem; several critics also noted how the song could be misconstrued in favor of jingoism. Margotin and Guesdon discuss the juxtaposition of the verses, which convey \"the somber reality of a soldier\", with the chorus which \"loudly and proudly proclaims the glory of American civilization\". AllMusic's Mike DeGayne argued that while the song would have been effective as an acoustic ballad, similar to \"My Hometown\" or \"Nebraska\"'s \"Atlantic City\", \"it's the fervor and the might of Springsteen in front of a bombastic array of guitar and drums that help to drive his message home\".\n\"Cover Me\" is a straightforward rock song, with elements of pop, disco, and funk. Lyrically, it describes a love story wherein the narrator, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, pleas for his lover to stay with him and protect him from the outside world. \"Darlington County\" is an upbeat rock song that some critics compared to the music of Creedence Clearwater Revival. It tells the story of two New York friends who embark on a road trip. They come to Darlington, South Carolina to work, but end up spending much of their time with women. The author Rob Kirkpatrick said the song was \"steeped in countrified blue-collarism\".\nThe rockabilly \"Working on the Highway\" sets upbeat music against downbeat lyrics. It tells the story of a man who runs away to Florida with an underage girl against her father's wishes. When he gets there, he is arrested and sentenced to forced labor. Originally \"Child Bride\" from the \"Nebraska\" demo tape, the final track retains the same story and several lines from the original lyrics.\n\"Downbound Train\" is a minimalist rock ballad featuring a synthesizer. The lyrics include themes of disillusionment and loss; \"Billboard\"'s Caryn Rose called it the album's saddest song. It follows a man who has lost everything: after being laid off from his lumberyard job, his wife leaves him, after which he struggles to make a living working at a car wash. Distressed, he dreams of his now ex-wife. The song's narrator is similar to the ones on \"Nebraska\" and \"Stolen Car\" from \"The River\".\n\"I'm on Fire\" is a minimalist ballad whose instrumentation consists of picked guitar, synthesizer, and brushed drums. Musically inspired by Johnny Cash, the song is an ode to adulterous lust, in which the narrator expresses an obsessive and uncontrollable desire for the heroine. Analyzing the song's placement in the track listing at the end of side one, Fine wrote that the song leaves \"a hushed, solemn interlude in the center of a mostly upbeat, ebullient album\", further arguing that \"it seems symbolic, both structurally and musically, as if marking a turning point in Springsteen's career from middle-America heartland rocker to synth- and dance-influenced mainstream star.\"\nSide two.\n\"No Surrender\" is an upbeat 1950s/1960s-style rock song with a \"dense, rich, and heavy sound\". The lyrics are a statement of friendship, freedom, and in Kirkpatrick's words \"youthful defiance with allusions to blood brotherhood and forced warlike metaphors\". The song is complemented by \"Bobby Jean\", another song about friendship. In it, the narrator visits the childhood home of the title character, causing his memories of them to come back in a nostalgic tone. Commentators have interpreted the title character's gender as intentionally ambiguous; they could refer to any close friend the singer had known since he was a teenager. Musically, it is a rock and roll ballad with an accented rhythm and near-dance groove.\n\"I'm Goin' Down\" is a rock song with elements of rockabilly. Its upbeat music contrasts with the lyrics, which tell a melancholic story about a couple on the verge of a break-up. The narrator's girlfriend has lost her passion and turned to indifference.\n\"Glory Days\" is an energetic synth-rock song that follows a protagonist speaking with old high-school classmates \u2013 a former baseball star and a popular girl now divorced with two kids \u2013 in a bar reflecting on the \"glory days\" of their youth with sadness. It was partially based on a true story of Springsteen meeting an old friend at a bar who had had the potential to become a professional baseball player in the early 1970s. Some commentators have argued the song opposes nostalgia rather than embracing it, as the protagonist pities the former high school heroes.\n\"Dancing in the Dark\" is an upbeat synth-pop and dance-rock song. Its protagonist struggles with life \u2013 he is bored with himself, cannot look at himself in a mirror, and feels trapped \u2013 and wants to change his daily routine by finding a spark that will reignite his imagination. Kirkpatrick has argued the song examines its author's creative process, showing Springsteen struggling to live up to expectations as both a songwriter and a performer. The song ends with a jazzy saxophone solo from Clemons.\n\"My Hometown\" is a folk ballad driven by a synthesizer. Throughout its four verses, the narrator grows from child to adult and experiences hardship living in his hometown. Based on Springsteen's personal experiences growing up in the 1960s, the song returns to the social issues raised in the album's first side, with themes centered on working-class life, racial tensions, violence and economic strife. \"Pitchfork\"'s Sam Sodomsky has argued the song \"captures what \"Born in the U.S.A.\" failed to: the tragedy of the American dream, the brutality and injustice that is fundamental to American citizenship, and the complicated, intractable love for one's home that still manages to take root in the midst of it all.\"\nArtwork.\nThe cover photograph shows Springsteen with his back to the camera against the stripes of an American flag. He wears a white T-shirt and jeans, with a red baseball cap tucked into his right back pocket. The cap belonged to the recently deceased father of his friend Lance Larson. Springsteen has said that the flag was included because the first track was called \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and the song's overarching theme reflected his writing of the past six or seven years. The cover became controversial; some commentators believed Springsteen was urinating on the flag, which he denied, telling Kurt Loder in \"Rolling Stone\" that there was no \"secret message\" and that \"the picture of my ass looked better than the picture of my face\". The cover was designed by Andrea Klein, as is one of the few Springsteen's studio album covers that does not show his face.\nThe photograph was taken by the portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz. She did not like the photo, and viewed it as a \"grab shot\". Other photographs by Leibovitz were used for promotional material, such as the cover for \"Dancing in the Dark\" single (capturing Springsteen jumping mid-air wearing a blue shirt, black leather jacket, and black pants) and the Born in the U.S.A. tour program (depicting Springsteen jumping in front of the American flag, wielding a guitar in a Pete Townshend-like windmill pose).\nThe inner sleeve contains black-and-white photographs of Springsteen, the E Street Band, and song lyrics. It includes Springsteen's farewell words to Van Zandt in Italian: \"Buon viaggio, mio fratello, Little Steven\" (\"Safe travels, my brother, Little Steven\"). The cover has appeared on \"Billboard\" and \"Rolling Stone\"'s lists of the 100 best album covers of all time at numbers 31 and 42, respectively.\nRelease and promotion.\nColumbia Records released \"Born in the U.S.A.\" on June 4, 1984. The album was the first compact disc manufactured in the United States for commercial release. It was manufactured by CBS (Columbia's international distributor) and Sony Music at their newly opened plant, Digital Audio Disc Corporation, in Terre Haute, Indiana, in September; Columbia's CDs were previously manufactured in Japan.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" debuted at number nine on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Top 200 Albums chart during the week of June 23, 1984, topping the chart two weeks later, on July 7. It stayed in the top 10 for 84 consecutive weeks and on the chart itself for almost three years. It was also a commercial success in Europe and Oceania. In the United Kingdom, the album entered the UK Albums Chart at number two on June 16, and after 34 weeks, on February 16, 1985, it reached number one and topped the chart for five non-consecutive weeks; it was present on the chart for 135 weeks. It also topped the album charts in Australia, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland. The album reached number two in France, Italy, Spain, and on the European Top 100 Albums chart. It also reached number six in Japan.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" was the best-selling album of 1985 and of Springsteen's career. It is one of the best-selling albums of all time, with worldwide sales of over 30 million copies. It was certified three times platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in July 1985, denoting shipments of 900,000 units in the U.K. After the advent of the North American Nielsen SoundScan tracking system in 1991, the album sold an additional 1,463,000 copies, and in May 2022, it was certified seventeen times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 17 million copies in the U.S.\nSingles.\nBy 1984, the music industry had become reliant on singles and music videos for success following the rise of MTV in the U.S. With the success of Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" (1982), record labels wanted to turn albums into \"mega-albums\". The music industry historian Steve Kropper has said that \"Thriller\" created a \"video-driven blueprint\" to keep an album high in the charts for at least an entire year. Springsteen and Landau had only envisioned one or two singles from \"Born in the U.S.A.\" Feeling otherwise, Columbia planned \"at least half a dozen\" possible singles, each accompanied by dance remixes and music videos to broaden airplay, both on the radio and in clubs. Sodomsky later wrote: \"MTV had evolved into a legitimate arm of the music industry, and Springsteen's new look [muscular with a bandana] helped him gain traction in an image-centric medium.\" Springsteen also conducted interviews with media outlets including \"People\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\".\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" was supported by a record-tying seven top ten singles. The first, \"Dancing in the Dark\" with \"Pink Cadillac\" on the B-side, was released on May 9, 1984. It peaked at number two on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and spent 21 weeks on the chart. Elsewhere, it topped the singles charts in Canada, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and also reached number four in the U.K. The 12\u2033 single featured three dance remixes of \"Dancing in the Dark\" by the producer Arthur Baker; it was the best-selling 12\u2033 single of the year. \"Cover Me\", featuring a 1981 live recording of Tom Waits' \"Jersey Girl\" as the B-side, was released as the second single on July 31. It spent 18 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number seven, as well as number two on \"Billboard\"'s Mainstream Rock chart. A dance remix by Baker appeared on a 12\u2033 single. \"Born in the U.S.A.\", backed by \"Shut Out the Light\", was issued as the third single on October 30. It spent 17 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, reaching number nine. Elsewhere, it topped the charts in Ireland and New Zealand, and peaked at number two in Australia, and number five in the U.K. A dance remix by Baker appeared on a 12\u2033 single in January 1985.\n\"I'm on Fire\", backed by \"Johnny Bye-Bye\", was released as the fourth single on February 6, 1985. It peaked at number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and remained on the chart for 20 weeks. \"Glory Days\" followed on May 13, with \"Stand on It\" as the B-side. It spent 18 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, peaking at number five. The sixth single, \"I'm Goin' Down\", was issued on August 27, backed by \"Janey, Don't You Lose Heart\". It reached number nine on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and also charted in Sweden and Italy. The seventh and final single, \"My Hometown\", was released on November 21, with a 1975 live recording of the Christmas song \"Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town\" as the B-side. It reached numbers six and nine in the U.S. and the U.K., respectively. CBS compiled the three extended dance remixes, two other singles, the five exclusive B-sides, and several songs from Springsteen's previous albums for release on \"The Born in the U.S.A. 12\u2033 Single Collection\" in the U.K. in 1985.\nMusic videos.\nFive of the album's seven singles were supported by music videos. \"Dancing in the Dark\" contains footage of a live performance at the St. Paul Civic Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on June 28 and 29, 1984. The video was directed by Brian De Palma, and contains a scene where Springsteen pulls a young fan, played by the then-unknown actress Courteney Cox, on stage to dance; Springsteen recreated the bit frequently with young female fans throughout the tour. De Palma's video introduced Springsteen to the MTV generation, helping Springsteen to reach a much wider audience. The filmmaker John Sayles directed the videos for \"Born in the U.S.A.\", \"I'm on Fire\", and \"Glory Days\". For the title track, Sayles interspersed concert footage of Springsteen singing the song, shot in Los Angeles in 1984, with footage of small-town America.\nFor the \"I'm on Fire\" video, Springsteen plays an auto mechanic captivated by a young woman in a white dress. The video won the award for Best Male Video at the 1985 MTV Video Music Awards. The video for \"Glory Days\" starred Springsteen as the song's titular baseball player, working on a construction site and practicing baseball pitches alone, reflecting on his \"glory days\". It transitions to a performance of the song at a club with the E Street Band, featuring both Steven Van Zandt and his replacement guitarist Nils Lofgren, alongside new backing vocalist Patti Scialfa. The video ends with Springsteen's character playing a game of catch with his son until his wife, played by Springsteen's first wife Julianne Phillips, picks them up. The video for \"My Hometown\" depicts a live performance of the song. It was directed by Arthur Rosato and was shot towards the end of the tour at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.\nTour.\nThe Born in the U.S.A. Tour consisted of 156 dates between m June 29, 1984, and October 2, 1985. Rehearsals began in early May 1984 at a point when the E Street Band had not performed together in two and a half years. The lineup included returning members Bittan, Clemons, Tallent, Federici, Weinberg; Nils Lofgren (who replaced Van Zandt as a second guitarist) and Patti Scialfa, who was hired by Springsteen as a backing vocalist four days before the tour began. Springsteen reworked his image to be \"highly masculinized\"; he wore sleeveless shirts to show his new muscular physique, was clean-shaven and held his curly hair up with a bandana.\nThe tour began in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where the video for \"Dancing in the Dark\" was filmed. The shows consisted of material spanning Springsteen's whole career. He often opened the shows with tracks from \"Born in the U.S.A.\" or \"Thunder Road\" (1975). The second set was primarily songs written after \"Nebraska\"'s release, such as \"Dancing in the Dark\", \"No Surrender\", and \"Bobby Jean\". Unlike previous tours, the set lists for the Born in the U.S.A. Tour typically remained the same every night, with few exceptions.\nSpringsteen attracted political attention during the initial U.S. leg when the conservative political commentator George Will attended the show in Largo, Maryland, on August 25. Will published a column in \"The Washington Post\" about Springsteen the following month, wherein he praised the performer's work ethic and discussed his \"presumed patriotism\" with the usage of the phrase \"born in the U.S.A.\" Less than a week after the column's publishing, President Ronald Reagan, in the middle of his reelection campaign, praised Springsteen's \"patriotism\" during a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey. Springsteen responded dismissively to Reagan's comments two days later during a show in Pittsburgh, and from around this time he began taking time at his shows to talk about his socialist ideology. Starting in November he donated some concert proceeds to local charities or community organizations.\nThe initial American leg of the tour ran through January 1985. The tour continued from late March to July around the world with shows in Australia, Japan, Europe, and the U.K. Springsteen married Phillips in May, between the Oceania and European legs. The European leg drew large crowds, including a 100,000 attendance in Ireland and three sold-out shows at Wembley Stadium in London. The final U.S. leg ran from August to October 2, ending with four consecutive shows at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The tour's massive success led to the creation of Springsteen's first live album, \"Live 1975\u201385\", released in November 1986.\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band performed the full \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album during a show at the Hard Rock Calling Festival in London at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on June 30, 2013. A DVD of the full performance, titled \"Born in the U.S.A. Live: London 2013\", was packaged with Amazon pre-orders of Springsteen's 18th studio album \"High Hopes\" in January 2014. Besides the 2013 London concert, Springsteen performed the entire \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album in 2009 at shows in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, several other concerts in 2013 including in Munich, Milan, and Rio De Janeiro, and in 2014 in Melbourne and Auckland.\nCritical reception.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" was very favorably reviewed on release. It was described as both accessible and containing new musical elements that critics such as Robert Hilburn and Sandy Robertson believed would both please longtime fans and attract a new audience. Writing for Shreveport, Louisiana's \"The Times\", Marshall Fine wrote: \"It's a superb effort, an album of rich musical and lyrical textures that can only enhance Springsteen's reputation as a rock 'n' roll original.\" Some critics described \"Born in the U.S.A.\" as a more commercial version of \"Nebraska\", one that is more easily digestible for a wider audience. In \"Rolling Stone\", Debby Miller said \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was as well thought-out as \"Nebraska\", but with more sophistication and spirit.\nSpringsteen's storytelling drew particular attention; Miller saw Springsteen creating \"such a vivid sense of these characters\" by \"[giving] them voices a playwright would be proud of\". The trade magazine \"Cash Box\" predicted \"Born in the U.S.A.\" would find success on album-oriented rock radio due to Springsteen's \"special\" ability to convey the lyrical messages of every song. \"Saturday Review\"'s John Swenson commended Springsteen for \"championing traditional rock values at a time when few newer bands show interest in such a direction\", while Robert Christgau of \"The Village Voice\" praised his evolution as an artist. In \"The New York Times\", Stephen Holden highlighted Springsteen as \"one of a very small number of rock performers who uses rock to express an ongoing epic vision of [America], individual social roots and the possibility of heroic self-creation.\" Others praised the instrumentation and vocal performances, and the performances of the E Street Band.\nNot all reviews were positive. Several critics noted that the lyrics bore heavily thematic similarities to those on his earlier albums. Richard Harrington of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the \"problem is that Springsteen's taken us down these mean side streets and through these badlands all too often since 1978's \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\".\" Robertson took less issue, arguing that Springsteen was \"polishing and perfecting his craft\", leading to his best work yet. Critics such as Harrington and the \"NME\"'s Charles Shaar Murray were more negative and wrote that the music \"deadly dull\" and \"dry\", respectively. According to Harrington, Springsteen had \"become a brooding, boorish visionary, with no respite of working class advocacy or the resilient spirit of youth\", while Murray argued that \"by abandoning all that 'rebel triumphant' blabber'n smoke, Springsteen displays the kind of moral and artistic integrity that rock music rarely shows any more.\" He summarized: \"No-one's going to get high on fantasy or rebellion from listening to \"Born in the U.S.A\".\"\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" was voted the best album of the year in the 1984 Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Christgau, the poll's creator, also ranked it number one on his list and in 1990 named it the ninth-best album of the 1980s. \"NME\", in their end-of-the-year list, placed it at number two, behind Bobby Womack's \"The Poet II\". In \"Rolling Stone\", Springsteen and the E Street Band won artist and band of the year, album of the year for \"Born in the U.S.A.\", and single and music video of the year for \"Dancing in the Dark\". At the 27th Annual Grammy Awards in 1985, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, while \"Dancing in the Dark\" was nominated for Record of the Year and won the award for Best Rock Vocal Performance, Male. \"Born in the U.S.A.\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the following year's ceremony.\nLegacy.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" made Springsteen a superstar and was his commercial and critical highpoint, touching off a wave of what the author Chris Smith termed \"Bossmania\". Although he was already well-known, the critic Larry Rodgers wrote that \"it was not until he hit the gym to get buffed up and showed off his rear end in [the] cover photo\" that he became an American pop icon\". The author Bryan K. Garman suggested that this new image helped Springsteen popularize his persona, while tying him to certain political and socio-cultural issues at a time when Ronald Reagan was promoting prosperity and U.S. global influence \"within a decidedly masculine framework\". \"Stereogum\"'s Ryan Leas later called the album \"one of the defining records of the '80s\".\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"Born In the U.S.A.\" changed my life, gave me my largest audience, forced me to think harder about the way I presented my music, and set me briefly at the center of the pop world.\n \u2014Bruce Springsteen, \"Born to Run\", 2016\nDespite \"Born in the U.S.A.\"'s commercial success, Springsteen was wary of his newfound fame. He later expressed reservations about the album, writing in his 2003 book \"Songs\", \"I put a lot of pressure on myself over a long period of time to reproduce the intensity of \"Nebraska\" ... I never got it.\" He felt the title track \"more or less stood by itself\" and that \"the rest of the album contains a group of songs about which I've always had some ambivalence\". Gabriel Fine argued that a \"central\" part of the album's legacy is the title track's misunderstood message and the \"struggle\" to make that message clear. According to Kirkpatrick, the album's legacy is complicated for longtime fans due to its large success and Springsteen's public image of \"muscular patriotism\" that surrounded its release and accompanying tour. The album also created a generational divide between new fans acquired from its success and fans of Springsteen's older works.\nThe album's success ultimately influenced Springsteen's career trajectory for the rest of the 1980s and 1990s. In response to his newfound fame, Springsteen attempted to scale himself back to be viewed as a \"normal\" middle-aged singer-songwriter. He later described the Born in the U.S.A. Tour as representing the end of the first phase of his career, believing he created an \"icon\" image that was not true to himself. For \"Tunnel of Love\" (1987), the follow-up to \"Born in the U.S.A.\", he recorded most of the parts himself using a synthesizer and wrote lyrics about love, romantic commitment, and married life. He used the E Street Band sparingly on the album before disbanding the group in 1989. In the 1990s, Springsteen ignored dominant music trends, such as grunge and alternative rock, as he created the music he wanted to make despite being aware of the potential commercial shortcomings. His albums during this period, \"Human Touch\", \"Lucky Town\" (both 1992), and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\" (1995), suffered commercially as a result. The author Steven Hyden argues that it was not until his and the E Street Band's Reunion Tour from 1999 to 2000, and the accompanying \"\" film and live album, that Springsteen re-established himself as a cultural icon. The following album, \"The Rising\" (2002), was his first full-length album with the E Street Band since \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and his first to top the \"Billboard\" 200 since \"Tunnel of Love\".\nInfluence.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" further popularized American heartland rock. By 1985, the album had boosted the profiles of other heartland rock artists and their albums, such as John Mellencamp (\"Scarecrow\"), Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers (\"Southern Accents\"), Dire Straits (\"Brothers in Arms\"), and Bob Seger. Mellencamp, in particular, was accused at the time of being a pale imitation of Springsteen. \"Born in the U.S.A.\" helped establish synthesizers as a key component of 1980s rock. According to Hyden, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" and the \"End of the Heartland\" which dissects the album and its impact forty years after its release, the album served as an influence for later rock bands who wanted to mimic the album's power and impact, such as the Killers with \"Sam's Town\" (2006), Arcade Fire with \"The Suburbs\" (2010), the War on Drugs with \"Lost in the Dream\" (2014), and Sam Fender with \"Hypersonic Missiles\" (2019).\nRetrospective reviews.\nIn later decades, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" has generally been regarded as one of Springsteen's best records. Sodomsky has called it \"the bold, brilliant, and misunderstood apex of Bruce Springsteen's imperial era\". To Hyden, \"Born in the U.S.A.\" remains Springsteen's most iconic album in the pop-culture zeitgeist and the one that defines his persona the most broadly. The music journalist Matty Karas described a \"quintessential pop album that was also a perfect distillation of the anger and bitterness seething beneath the surface of Reagan-era America.\" Neil McCormick of \"The Daily Telegraph\" praised the way that Springsteen \"deftly juxtaposed\" this anger with a sense of celebration, often within the same track, while producing his most \"tightly honed\" work.\nThe album still attracts mixed assessments. While one critic opined the album aged well into the 2000s, others have felt its production dates it to the 1980s, including critics who maintain that this production was made up for by the quality of the songs, or otherwise added \"historical value\" to the album. More negatively, \"Q\" magazine's journalist Richard Williams has criticized Springsteen's exaggeration of his usual characters and themes in a deliberate attempt at commercial success, accusing the singer of irresponsibly using American patriotism and \"clenched-fist bombast\" to cover up the album's anti-war stance. In a 2003 overview of all the singer's albums, \"The Gazette\"'s Bernard Perusse wrote of \"Born in the U.S.A.\" that \"by [Springsteen's] standards, it was a weak batch of songs\".\nRankings.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" has appeared on several best-of lists. In 1987 it was voted the fifth greatest rock album of all time in Paul Gambaccini's \"\" poll of 81 critics, writers and radio broadcasters. \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number 85 on their 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, 86 in a 2012 revised list, and 142 in a 2020 revised list. In 2013, it was named the 428th greatest album in a similar list published by \"NME\". It was included in the 2016 edition of the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\".\nThe album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2012. The year \"Paste\" magazine described it as the fourth best album of the 1980s. In 2015, \"Ultimate Classic Rock\" included it on a list compiling the best rock albums of the 1980s.\nReissues.\n\"Born in the U.S.A.\" was first reissued by Columbia on CD in 2000, followed by an LP and CD reissue by Sony BMG in 2007 and 2008, respectively. In 2015, Sony Music released a remastered version of the album on both LP and CD. On June 14, 2024, Sony Music reissued the album again on translucent red vinyl, featuring a booklet with new sleeve notes by Springsteen's archivist Erik Flannigan and a lithograph to mark its 40th anniversary.\nPersonnel.\nAccording to the liner notes:\nThe E Street Band\nAdditional musicians\nTechnical\nCharts.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The country's gross domestic product (GDP) was US$6.00 billion in 2024. Attractive for shoppers from France and Spain as a free port, Andorra also has developed active summer and winter tourist resorts. With some 270 hotels and 400 restaurants, as well as many shops, the tourist trade employs a growing portion of the domestic labour force. An estimated 10 million tourists visit annually.\nThere is a fairly active trade in consumer goods, including imported manufactured items, which, because they are duty-free, are less expensive in Andorra than in neighboring countries. Andorra's duty-free status also has had a significant effect on the controversy concerning its relationship with the European Union (EU). Its negotiations on duty-free status and relationship with the EU began in 1987, soon after Spain joined. An agreement that went into effect in July 1991 sets duty-free quotas and places limits on certain items \u2013 mainly milk products, tobacco products and alcoholic beverages. Andorra is permitted to maintain price differences from other EU countries, and visitors enjoy limited duty-free allowances.\nThe results of Andorra's elections thus far indicate that many support the government's reform initiatives and believe the country must, to some degree, integrate into the European Union in order to continue to enjoy its prosperity. Although arable land comprises less than 2% of the country, agriculture was the mainstay of the Andorran economy until the upsurge in tourism. Sheep raising has been the principal agricultural activity, but tobacco growing is lucrative. Most of Andorra's food is imported.\nIn addition to handicrafts, manufacturing includes cigars, cigarettes and furniture for domestic and export markets. A hydroelectric plant at Les Escaldes, with a capacity of 26.5 megawatts, provides 40% of Andorra's electricity; Spain provides the rest.\nOverview.\nTourism is the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounting for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 9 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its \"tax haven\" status, also contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs).\nStatistics.\nGDP: purchasing power parity - US$3.327 billion (2015)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 190\nGDP - real growth rate: 8.95% (2015 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 132\nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - US$49,900 (2015)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 29\nGDP - composition by sector: \n(2015 est.)&lt;br&gt;\"agriculture:\" 11.9%\n&lt;br&gt;\"industry:\" 33.6%\n&lt;br&gt;\"services:\" 54.5%\nPopulation below poverty line: N/A\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\n&lt;br&gt;\"lowest 10%:\" N/A\n&lt;br&gt;\"highest 10%:\" N/A\nInflation rate (consumer prices):\n-0.9% (2015 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 225\nLabor force: 42,230 (2007)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 185\nLabor force - by occupation:\nagriculture 0.3%, industry 20.8%, services 79% (2007)\nUnemployment rate: 3.7%\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 183\nBudget:\n&lt;br&gt;\"revenues:\" US$1.872 billion\n&lt;br&gt;\"expenditures:\" US$2.06 billion (2016)\nIndustries:\ntourism (particularly skiing), banking, timber, furniture\nIndustrial production growth rate: -3.9% (2020 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 184\nElectricity - production: N/A\nElectricity - production by source:\n&lt;br&gt;\"fossil fuel:\" 0%\n&lt;br&gt;\"hydro:\" 40%\n&lt;br&gt;\"nuclear:\" 0%\n&lt;br&gt;\"other:\" 60% imported from Spain\nElectricity - consumption: N/A\nElectricity - exports: N/A\nElectricity - imports: N/A; note - imports electricity from Spain and France; Andorra generates a small amount of hydropower\nAgriculture - products: small quantities of rye, wheat, barley, oats, vegetables, tobacco, sheep, cattle\nExports: US$1.842 billion f.o.b.

Many of these are said to free imagination by producing a creative process free of conscious control. The importance of the unconscious as a source of inspiration is central to the nature of surrealism.\nThe Surrealist movement has been a fractious one since its inception. The value and role of the various techniques has been one of many subjects of disagreement. Some Surrealists consider automatism and games to be sources of inspiration only, while others consider them starting points for finished works. Others consider the items created through automatism to be finished works themselves, needing no further refinement.\nAerography.\nAerography is a technique in which a 3-dimensional object is used as a stencil with spraypainting. Both conceptually and technically the airbrush painting method presented a new point of departure from a traditional way of painting. Man Ray recalled, \"(\u2026) It was thrilling to paint a picture, hardly touching the surface - a purely cerebral act, as it were.\"\nAutomatism.\nAutomatism was used in different ways for each art: \nThe Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal used the method of automatic text in his famous book \"I Served the King of England\". One chapter in the book is written as a single sentence, and at the end of the book Hrabal endorses the use of automatic writing.\nBulletism.\nBulletism is shooting ink at a blank piece of paper. The artist can then develop images based on what is seen.\nCalligram.\nA calligram is a text or poem of a type in which the words or letters make up a shape, particularly a shape connected to the subject of the text or poem. The concept was developed by Guillaume Apollinaire in his 1918 collection \"Calligrammes\".\nCollage.\nCollage is the assemblage of different forms creating a new whole. For example, an artistic collage work may include newspaper clippings, ribbons, bits of colored or hand-made papers, photographs, etc., glued to a solid support or canvas. Tearing papers can suggest an act of artistic experience, connoting an emotional or creative crisis.\nCoulage.\nA coulage is a kind of automatic or involuntary sculpture made by pouring a molten material (such as metal, wax, chocolate or white chocolate) into cold water. As the material cools it takes on what appears to be a random (or aleatoric) form, though the physical properties of the materials involved may lead to a conglomeration of discs or spheres. The artist may use a variety of techniques to affect the outcome.\nThis technique is also used in the divination process known as ceromancy.\nCubomania.\nCubomania is a method of making collages in which a picture or image is cut into squares and the squares are then reassembled without regard for the image. The technique was first used by the Romanian surrealist Gherasim Luca.\nCut-up technique.\nCut-up technique is a literary form or method in which a text is cut up at random and rearranged to create a new text.\nDecalcomania.\nDecalcomania is a process of spreading thick paint upon a canvas then\u2014while it is still wet\u2014covering it with further material such as paper or aluminium foil. This covering is then removed (again before the paint dries), and the resultant paint pattern becomes the basis of the finished painting. The technique was much employed by artists such as Max Ernst.\nDream r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nThe dream r\u00e9sum\u00e9 takes the form of an employment r\u00e9sum\u00e9 but chronicles its subject's achievements, employment, or the like, in dreams, rather than in waking life. Sometimes dream r\u00e9sum\u00e9s contain the achievements of both, however.\nEcho poem.\nAn echo poem is a poem written using a technique invented by Aur\u00e9lien Dauguet in 1972. The poem is composed by one or more persons, working together in a process as follows.\nThe first \"stanza\" of the poem is written on the left-hand column of a piece of paper divided into two columns. Then the \"opposite\", or 'echo', of the first stanza, in whatever sense is appropriate to the poem, is composed in the right-hand column of the page. The writing is done automatically and often the \"opposite\" stanza is composed of a phonetic correspondence to the first stanza.\nFor a longer work, the third stanza can then begin in the left-hand column as an \"opposite\" or a phonetic correspondence to what preceded it in the right-hand column. Then the fourth stanza might be an \"opposite\" or sound correspondence to what preceded it in the left-hand column, and so forth. When the poem is completed, the echo of the last phrase, line, or sentence, generally serves as the title.\nThis is unrelated to the non-Surrealist echo verse form which appears as a dialogue between the questions of a character and the answers of the nymph Echo.\n\u00c9claboussure.\n\u00c9claboussure is a process in Surrealist painting where oil paints or watercolours are laid down and water or turpentine is splattered, then soaked up to reveal random splatters or dots where the media was removed. This technique gives the appearance of space and atmosphere. It was used in paintings by Remedios Varo.\n\u00c9cr\u00e9mage.\nAn automatic technique in which paint or ink is floated on the surface of water before being skimmed off with paper or board. The technique was developed by Conroy Maddox.\nEntopic graphomania.\nEntopic graphomania is a surrealist and automatic method of drawing in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper, and lines are then made between the dots; these can be either \"curved lines... or straight lines\". Ithell Colquhoun described its results as \"the most austere kind of geometric abstraction.\" The technique aims to stimulate creative process and subconscious associations. It is to be distinguished from \"entoptic\" methods of drawing or art-making, inspired by entoptic phenomena.\nThe method was invented by Dolfi Trost, who as the subtitle of his 1945 book (\"Vision dans le cristal. Oniromancie obsessionelle. Et neuf graphomanies entopiques\") suggests, included nine examples therein. Trost believed in transformation of human consciousness through a dialectical process that can lead to a modification of human existence at both the personal and social level. This method of \"indecipherable writing\" was supposedly an example of \"surautomatism\", the controversial theory put forward by Trost and Gherashim Luca in which surrealist methods would be practiced that \"went beyond\" automatism. In \"Dialectique de Dialectique\" they had proposed the further radicalization of surrealist automatism by abandoning images produced by artistic techniques in favour of those \"resulting from rigorously applied scientific procedures,\" allegedly cutting the notion of \"artist\" out of the process of creating images and replacing it with chance and scientific rigour. However, the question has arisen whether an algorithm should be used to determine in what order to connect the dots to maintain the \"automatic\" nature of the method.\nThe method has been compared to the \"voronoi mathematical progression\".\n\u00c9tr\u00e9cissements.\nCollage is perceived as an additive method of visual poetry whereas \u00c9tr\u00e9cissements are a reductive method. This was first employed by Marcel Mari\u00ebn in the 1950s. The results are achieved by the cutting away of parts of images to encourage a new image, by means of a pair of scissors or any other manipulative sharpened instrument.\nExquisite corpse.\nExquisite corpse or Cadavre exquis is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled. It is based on an old parlour game known by the same name (and also as Consequences) in which players wrote in turn on a sheet of paper, folded it to conceal part of the writing, and then passed it to the next player for a further contribution.\nFrottage.\nFrottage is a method of creation in which one takes a pencil or other drawing tool and makes a \"rubbing\" over a textured surface. The drawing can either be left as it is or used as the basis for further refinement. The technique was developed in 1925 by Max Ernst, who was inspired by an ancient wooden floor where the grain of the planks had been accentuated by many years of scrubbing. The patterns of the graining suggested strange images to him. He captured these by laying sheets of paper on the floor and then rubbing over them with a soft pencil.\nFumage.\nFumage is a technique in which impressions are made by the smoke of a candle or kerosene lamp on a piece of paper or canvas. This technique was introduced by Wolfgang Paalen.\nGames.\nIn Surrealism, games are important not only as a form of recreation but as a method of investigation. The intention is to cut away the constraints of rationalism and allow concepts to develop more freely and in a more random manner. The aim is to break traditional thought patterns and create a more original outcome.\nOld games such as Exquisite corpse, and newer ones, notably Time Travelers' Potlatch and Parallel Collage, have played a critical role.\nExquisite corpse is a method by which a collection of words or images are collectively assembled, the result being known as the exquisite corpse or \"cadavre exquis\" in French. Later the game was adapted to drawing and collage.\nTime Travelers' Potlatch is a game in which two or more players say what gift they would give to another person - this is usually an historical person who played a role in, or had an influence on, the formation of Surrealism.\nGrattage.\nGrattage is a surrealist technique in painting in which (usually wet) paint is scraped off the canvas. It was employed by Max Ernst and Joan Mir\u00f3.\nHeatage.\nHeatage is an automatic technique developed and used by David Hare in which an exposed but unfixed photographic negative is heated from below, causing the emulsion (and the resulting image, when developed) to distort in a random fashion.\nIndecipherable writing.\nIn addition to its obvious meaning of writing that is illegibile or for whatever other reason cannot be made out by the reader, indecipherable writing refers to a set of automatic techniques, most developed by Romanian surrealists and falling under the heading of surautomatism. Examples include entoptic graphomania, fumage and the movement of liquid down a vertical surface.\nInvoluntary sculpture.\nSurrealism describes as \"involuntary sculpture\" those made by absent-mindedly manipulating something, such as rolling and unrolling a movie ticket, bending a paper clip, and so forth.\nLatent news.\nLatent news is a game in which an article from a newspaper is cut into individual words (or perhaps phrases) and then rapidly reassembled; see also Cut-up technique.\nMovement of liquid down a vertical surface.\nPictures can be produced by dripping or allowing a flow of some form of liquid down a vertical surface. The technique was invented by surrealists from Romania and said by them to be surautomatic and a form of indecipherable writing.\nParanoiac-critical method.\nParanoiac-critical method is a technique invented by Salvador Dal\u00ed which consists of the artist invoking a paranoid state (fear that the self is being manipulated, targeted or controlled by others). The result is a deconstruction of the psychological concept of identity, such that subjectivity becomes the primary aspect of the artwork.\nParsemage.\nParsemage is a surrealist and automatic method in the visual arts invented by Ithell Colquhoun in which dust from charcoal or colored chalk is scattered on the surface of water and then skimmed off by passing a stiff paper or cardboard just under the water's surface.\nPhotomontage.\nPhotomontage is making of composite picture by cutting and joining a number of photographs.\nSifflage.\nSifflage is the technique used by Jimmy Ernst in which liquid paint is blown to inspire or reveal an image. This is sometimes called \"soufflage\", but Ernst's name was \"sifflage\".\nThe result can be seen in his \"Echo Plasm\".\nSurautomatism.\nSurautomatism is any theory or act of taking automatism to its most absurd limits.\nTriptography.\nTriptography is an automatic photographic technique whereby a roll of film is used three times (either by the same photographer or, in the spirit of Exquisite Corpse, three different photographers), causing it to be triple-exposed in such a way that the chances of any single photograph having a clear and definite subject is nearly impossible. Indeed, finding any edges on the negative itself during the developing process is a nearly impossible task. Typically the developing of such a roll of film is an exercise in automatic technique in and of itself, cutting the film by counting sprocket holes alone, with no regard for the images present on the negative. The results have a quality reminiscent of the transitory period in sleep when one dream suddenly becomes another.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is no public transport, such as bus or rail systems, since there isn't enough need. However, Anguilla's roads are better maintained than on many Caribbean islands. \nCars are the main means of transport, with driving on the left-hand side of the road, as in the United Kingdom. Although speed limits rarely exceed per hour and traffic moves slowly, with the island's small size it doesn't take long to get anywhere. Taxi service is unmetered, with set rates published in tourist guides. In addition to regular transport, taxis often offer island tours lasting several hours. Fares must be paid in cash. \nFerries offer transport from Anguilla to other islands. The ferry from Blowing Point to Marigot, St. Martin, known to the locals as the Haddad Express, runs all day on the half-hour, into the night time. With no reservations required, taking the ferry is simple and inexpensive. Ferries can also be chartered to other destinations. One such Charter Service is from Blowing Point, Anguilla to Princess Juliana Airport to make travel easier. \nOther means of transport include bicycles, mopeds, motorcycles and walking. Because of the territory's small land mass and flatter terrain, these methods make more sense on Anguilla than on many other Caribbean islands.\nCars, bikes, mopeds and motorcycles are all available for rental at reasonable prices.

In subtropical countries like Australia and India, figs are popular choices as shade trees. In tropical countries, trees such as some \"Erythrina\" and African tulip tree species are often planted as shade trees.\nSpecialities.\nThese trees are commonly grown, and/or used, as shade trees due to their protuberant size:\nPlanting.\nThere are a few factors to consider when choosing a shade tree: deciduousness, coverage, longevity, and the ability of the roots to damage foundations. Shade trees can enhance the privacy of a garden, patio, or back yard, by obstructing the view of outsiders. A disadvantage is that in cool climates, an abundance of shade trees may lead to a dank environment in any nearby buildings or gardens. Shade trees must not be planted near chimneys as flying fire sparks can ignite tree branches which could cause rapidly expanding fires.\nPlanting shade trees around a home can also reduce the energy that homeowners use in the summer months. Planting shade trees in locations near a home air conditioner can keep the air conditioner cooler which helps it run more efficiently, so less energy is used.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67611", "revid": "2387872", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67611", "title": "Tennessine", "text": "element with atomic number 117 (Ts)\nTennessine is a synthetic element; it has symbol Ts and atomic number 117. It has the second-highest atomic number, the joint-highest atomic mass of all known elements, and is the penultimate element of the 7th period of the periodic table. It is named after the U.S. state of Tennessee, where key research institutions involved in its discovery are located (however, the IUPAC says that the element is named after the \"region of Tennessee\").\nThe discovery of tennessine was officially announced in Dubna, Russia, by a Russian\u2013American collaboration in April 2010, which makes it the most recently discovered element. One of its daughter isotopes was created directly in 2011, partially confirming the experiment's results. The experiment was successfully repeated by the same collaboration in 2012 and by a joint German\u2013American team in May 2014. In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), which evaluates claims of discovery of new elements, recognized the element and assigned the priority to the Russian\u2013American team. In June 2016, the IUPAC published a declaration stating that the discoverers had suggested the name \"tennessine\", a name which was officially adopted in November 2016.\nTennessine may be located in the \"island of stability\", a concept that explains why some superheavy elements are more stable despite an overall trend of decreasing stability for elements beyond bismuth on the periodic table. The synthesized tennessine atoms have lasted tens and hundreds of milliseconds. In the periodic table, tennessine is expected to be a member of group 17, the halogens. Some of its properties may differ significantly from those of the lighter halogens due to relativistic effects. As a result, tennessine is expected to be a volatile metal that neither forms anions nor achieves high oxidation states. A few key properties, such as its melting and boiling points and its first ionization energy, are nevertheless expected to follow the periodic trends of the halogens.\nHistory.\nPre-discovery.\nIn December\u00a02004, the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) team in Dubna, Moscow Oblast, Russia, proposed a joint experiment with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, United States, to synthesize element\u00a0117 \u2014 so called for the 117\u00a0protons in its nucleus. Their proposal involved fusing a berkelium (element\u00a097) target and a calcium (element\u00a020) beam, conducted via bombardment of the berkelium target with calcium nuclei: this would complete a set of experiments done at the JINR on the fusion of actinide targets with a calcium-48 beam, which had thus far produced the new elements 113\u2013116 and 118. ORNL\u2014then the world's only producer of berkelium\u2014could not then provide the element, as they had temporarily ceased production, and re-initiating it would be too costly. Plans to synthesize element\u00a0117 were suspended in favor of the confirmation of element\u00a0118, which had been produced earlier in 2002 by bombarding a californium target with calcium. The required berkelium-249 is a by-product in californium-252 production, and obtaining the required amount of berkelium was an even more difficult task than obtaining that of californium, as well as costly: It would cost around 3.5\u00a0million dollars, and the parties agreed to wait for a commercial order of californium production, from which berkelium could be extracted.\nThe JINR team sought to use berkelium because calcium-48, the isotope of calcium used in the beam, has 20\u00a0protons and 28\u00a0neutrons, making a neutron\u2013proton ratio of 1.4; and it is the lightest stable or near-stable nucleus with such a large neutron excess. Thanks to the neutron excess, the resulting nuclei were expected to be heavier and closer to the sought-after island of stability. Of the aimed for 117\u00a0protons, calcium has 20, and thus they needed to use berkelium, which has 97\u00a0protons in its nucleus.\nIn February\u00a02005, the leader of the JINR team \u2014 Yuri Oganessian \u2014 presented a colloquium at ORNL. Also in attendance were representatives of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, who had previously worked with JINR on the discovery of elements 113\u2013116 and 118, and Joseph Hamilton of Vanderbilt University, a collaborator of Oganessian.\nHamilton checked if the ORNL high-flux reactor produced californium for a commercial order: The required berkelium could be obtained as a by-product. He learned that it did not and there was no expectation for such an order in the immediate future. Hamilton kept monitoring the situation, making the checks once in a while. (Later, Oganessian referred to Hamilton as \"the father of 117\" for doing this work.)\nDiscovery.\nORNL resumed californium production in spring\u00a02008. Hamilton noted the restart during the summer and made a deal on subsequent extraction of berkelium (the price was about $600,000). During a September\u00a02008 symposium at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, celebrating his 50th year on the Physics faculty, Hamilton introduced Oganessian to James Roberto (then the deputy director for science and technology at ORNL). They established a collaboration among JINR, ORNL, and Vanderbilt. Clarice Phelps was part of ORNL's team that collaborated with JINR; this is particularly notable as because of it the IUPAC recognizes her as the first African-American woman to be involved with the discovery of a chemical element. The eventual collaborating institutions also included The University of Tennessee (Knoxville), Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, The Research Institute for Advanced Reactors (Russia), and The University of Nevada (Las Vegas). \nIn November 2008, the U.S. Department of Energy, which had oversight over the reactor in Oak Ridge, allowed the scientific use of the extracted berkelium.\nThe production lasted 250\u00a0days and ended in late December\u00a02008, resulting in 22\u00a0milligrams of berkelium, enough to perform the experiment. In January 2009, the berkelium was removed from ORNL's High Flux Isotope Reactor; it was subsequently cooled for 90 days and then processed at ORNL's Radiochemical Engineering and Development Center to separate and purify the berkelium material, which took another 90 days. Its half-life is only 330\u00a0days: this means, after that time, half the berkelium produced would have decayed. Because of this, the berkelium target had to be quickly transported to Russia; for the experiment to be viable, it had to be completed within six months of its departure from the United States. The target was packed into five lead containers to be flown from New York to Moscow.\nRussian customs officials twice refused to let the target enter the country because of missing or incomplete paperwork. Over the span of a few days, the target traveled over the Atlantic Ocean five times. On its arrival in Russia in June 2009, the berkelium was immediately transferred to Research Institute of Atomic Reactors (RIAR) in Dimitrovgrad, Ulyanovsk Oblast, where it was deposited as a 300-nanometer-thin layer on a titanium film. In July\u00a02009, it was transported to Dubna, where it was installed in the particle accelerator at the JINR. The calcium-48 beam was generated by chemically extracting the small quantities of calcium-48 present in naturally occurring calcium, enriching it 500 times. This work was done in the closed town of Lesnoy, Sverdlovsk Oblast, Russia.\nThe experiment began in late July\u00a02009. In January 2010, scientists at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions announced internally that they had detected the decay of a new element with atomic number\u00a0117 via two decay chains: one of an odd\u2013odd isotope undergoing 6\u00a0alpha decays before spontaneous fission, and one of an odd\u2013even isotope undergoing 3 alpha decays before fission. The obtained data from the experiment was sent to the LLNL for further analysis. On 9\u00a0April 2010, an official report was released in the journal \"Physical Review Letters\" identifying the isotopes as 294117 and 293117, which were shown to have half-lives on the order of tens or hundreds of milliseconds. The work was signed by all parties involved in the experiment to some extent: JINR, ORNL, LLNL, RIAR, Vanderbilt, the University of Tennessee (Knoxville, Tennessee, U.S.), and the University of Nevada (Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S.), which provided data analysis support. The isotopes were formed as follows:\nBk + Ca \u2192 297117* \u2192 294117 + 3 (1 event)\nBk + Ca \u2192 297117* \u2192 293117 + 4 (5 events)\nConfirmation.\nAll daughter isotopes (decay products) of element\u00a0117 were previously unknown; therefore, their properties could not be used to confirm the claim of discovery. In 2011, when one of the decay products (289115) was synthesized directly, its properties matched those measured in the claimed indirect synthesis from the decay of element\u00a0117. The discoverers did not submit a claim for their findings in 2007\u20132011 when the Joint Working Party was reviewing claims of discoveries of new elements.\nThe Dubna team repeated the experiment in 2012, creating seven atoms of element\u00a0117 and confirming their earlier synthesis of element\u00a0118 (produced after some time when a significant quantity of the berkelium-249 target had beta decayed to californium-249). The results of the experiment matched the previous outcome. In May\u00a02014, a joint German\u2013American collaboration of scientists from the ORNL and the GSI Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Hessen, Germany, claimed to have confirmed discovery of the element. The team repeated the Dubna experiment using the Darmstadt accelerator, creating two atoms of element\u00a0117.\nIn December\u00a02015, the JWP officially recognized the discovery of 293117 on account of the confirmation of the properties of its daughter 289115, and thus the listed discoverers \u2014 JINR, LLNL, and ORNL \u2014 were given the right to suggest an official name for the element. (Vanderbilt was left off the initial list of discoverers in an error that was later corrected.)\nIn May\u00a02016, Lund University (Lund, Scania, Sweden) and GSI cast some doubt on the syntheses of elements\u00a0115 and 117. The decay chains assigned to 289115, the isotope instrumental in the confirmation of the syntheses of elements\u00a0115 and 117, were found based on a new statistical method to be too different to belong to the same nuclide with a reasonably high probability. The reported 293117 decay chains approved as such by the JWP were found to require splitting into individual data sets assigned to different isotopes of element\u00a0117. It was also found that the claimed link between the decay chains reported as from 293117 and 289115 probably did not exist. (On the other hand, the chains from the non-approved isotope 294117 were found to be congruent.) The multiplicity of states found when nuclides that are not even\u2013even undergo alpha decay is not unexpected and contributes to the lack of clarity in the cross-reactions. This study criticized the JWP report for overlooking subtleties associated with this issue, and considered it \"problematic\" that the only argument for the acceptance of the discoveries of elements\u00a0115 and 117 was a link they considered to be doubtful.\nOn 8\u00a0June 2017, two members of the Dubna team published a journal article answering these criticisms, analysing their data on the nuclides 293117 and 289115 with widely accepted statistical methods, noted that the 2016 studies indicating non-congruence produced problematic results when applied to radioactive decay: they excluded from the 90% confidence interval both average and extreme decay times, and the decay chains that would be excluded from the 90% confidence interval they chose were more probable to be observed than those that would be included. The 2017 reanalysis concluded that the observed decay chains of 293117 and 289115 were consistent with the assumption that only one nuclide was present at each step of the chain, although it would be desirable to be able to directly measure the mass number of the originating nucleus of each chain as well as the excitation function of the 243Am + 48Ca reaction.\nNaming.\nUsing Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, element\u00a0117 should be known as \"eka-astatine\". Using the 1979 recommendations by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the element was temporarily called \"ununseptium\" (symbol \"Uus\"), formed from Latin roots \"one\", \"one\", and \"seven\", a reference to the element's atomic number\u00a0117. Many scientists in the field called it \"element\u00a0117\", with the symbol \"E117\", \"(117)\", or \"117\". According to guidelines of IUPAC valid at the moment of the discovery approval, the permanent names of new elements should have ended in \"-ium\"; this included element\u00a0117, even if the element was a halogen, which traditionally have names ending in \"-ine\"; however, the new recommendations published in 2016 recommended using the \"-ine\" ending for all new group\u00a017 elements.\nAfter the original synthesis in 2010, Dawn Shaughnessy of LLNL and Oganessian declared that naming was a sensitive question, and it was avoided as far as possible. However, Hamilton, who teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, declared that year, \"I was crucial in getting the group together and in getting the 249Bk target essential for the discovery. As a result of that, I'm going to get to name the element. I can't tell you the name, but it will bring distinction to the region.\" In a 2015 interview, Oganessian, after telling the story of the experiment, said, \"and the Americans named this a tour de force, they had demonstrated they could do [this] with no margin for error. Well, soon they will name the 117th element.\"\nIn March\u00a02016, the discovery team agreed on a conference call involving representatives from the parties involved on the name \"tennessine\" for element\u00a0117. In June 2016, IUPAC published a declaration stating the discoverers had submitted their suggestions for naming the new elements\u00a0115, 117, and 118 to the IUPAC; the suggestion for the element\u00a0117 was \"tennessine\", with a symbol of \"Ts\", after \"the region of Tennessee\". The suggested names were recommended for acceptance by the IUPAC Inorganic Chemistry Division; formal acceptance was set to occur after a five-month term following publishing of the declaration expires. In November 2016, the names, including tennessine, were formally accepted. Concerns that the proposed symbol \"Ts\" may clash with a notation for the tosyl group used in organic chemistry were rejected, following existing symbols bearing such dual meanings: Ac (actinium and acetyl) and Pr (praseodymium and propyl). The naming ceremony for moscovium, tennessine, and oganesson was held on 2 March 2017 at the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow; a separate ceremony for tennessine alone had been held at ORNL in January 2017.\nPredicted properties.\nOther than nuclear properties, no properties of tennessine or its compounds have been measured; this is due to its extremely limited and expensive production and the fact that it decays very quickly. Properties of tennessine remain unknown and only predictions are available.\nNuclear stability and isotopes.\nThe stability of nuclei quickly decreases with the increase in atomic number after curium, element\u00a096, whose half-life is four orders of magnitude longer than that of any subsequent element. All isotopes with an atomic number above 101 undergo radioactive decay with half-lives of less than 30 hours. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. This is because of the ever-increasing Coulomb repulsion of protons, so that the strong nuclear force cannot hold the nucleus together against spontaneous fission for long. Calculations suggest that in the absence of other stabilizing factors, elements with more than 104 protons should not exist. However, researchers in the 1960s suggested that the closed nuclear shells around 114\u00a0protons and 184\u00a0neutrons should counteract this instability, creating an \"island of stability\" where nuclides could have half-lives reaching thousands or millions of years. While scientists have still not reached the island, the mere existence of the superheavy elements (including tennessine) confirms that this stabilizing effect is real, and in general the known superheavy nuclides become exponentially longer-lived as they approach the predicted location of the island. Tennessine is the second-heaviest element created so far, and all its known isotopes have half-lives of less than one second. Nevertheless, this is longer than the values predicted prior to their discovery: the predicted lifetimes for 293Ts and 294Ts used in the discovery paper were 10\u00a0ms and 45\u00a0ms respectively, while the observed lifetimes were 21\u00a0ms and 112\u00a0ms respectively. The Dubna team believes that the synthesis of the element is direct experimental proof of the existence of the island of stability.\nIt has been calculated that the isotope 295Ts would have a half-life of about 18\u00a0milliseconds, and it may be possible to produce this isotope via the same berkelium\u2013calcium reaction used in the discoveries of the known isotopes, 293Ts and 294Ts. The chance of this reaction producing 295Ts is estimated to be, at most, one-seventh the chance of producing 294Ts. This isotope could also be produced in a pxn channel of the 249Cf+48Ca reaction that successfully produced oganesson, evaporating a proton alongside some neutrons; the heavier tennessine isotopes 296Ts and 297Ts could similarly be produced in the 251Cf+48Ca reaction. Calculations using a quantum tunneling model predict the existence of several isotopes of tennessine up to 303Ts. The most stable of these is expected to be 296Ts with an alpha-decay half-life of 40\u00a0milliseconds. A liquid drop model study on the element's isotopes shows similar results; it suggests a general trend of increasing stability for isotopes heavier than 301Ts, with partial half-lives exceeding the age of the universe for the heaviest isotopes like 335Ts when beta decay is not considered. Lighter isotopes of tennessine may be produced in the 243Am+50Ti reaction, which was considered as a contingency plan by the Dubna team in 2008 if 249Bk proved unavailable; the isotopes 289Ts through 292Ts could also be produced as daughters of element 119 isotopes that can be produced in the 243Am+54Cr and 249Bk+50Ti reactions.\nAtomic and physical.\nTennessine is expected to be a member of group 17 in the periodic table, below the five halogens; fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine, each of which has seven valence electrons with a configuration of \"n\"s2\"n\"p5. For tennessine, being in the seventh period (row) of the periodic table, continuing the trend would predict a valence electron configuration of 7s27p5, and it would therefore be expected to behave similarly to the halogens in many respects that relate to this electronic state. However, going down group\u00a017, the metallicity of the elements increases; for example, iodine already exhibits a metallic luster in the solid state, and astatine is expected to be a metal. As such, an extrapolation based on periodic trends would predict tennessine to be a rather volatile metal.\nCalculations have confirmed the accuracy of this simple extrapolation, although experimental verification of this is currently impossible as the half-lives of the known tennessine isotopes are too short. Significant differences between tennessine and the previous halogens are likely to arise, largely due to spin\u2013orbit interaction\u2014the mutual interaction between the motion and spin of electrons. The spin\u2013orbit interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster\u2014at velocities comparable to the speed of light\u2014than those in lighter atoms. In tennessine atoms, this lowers the 7s and the 7p electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, although two of the 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The stabilization of the 7s electrons is called the inert pair effect; the effect that separates the 7p subshell into the more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts is called subshell splitting. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number \"l\" from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. For many theoretical purposes, the valence electron configuration may be represented to reflect the 7p subshell split as 7s7p7p.\nDifferences for other electron levels also exist. For example, the 6d electron levels (also split in two, with four being 6d3/2 and six being 6d5/2) are both raised, so they are close in energy to the 7s ones, although no 6d electron chemistry has ever been predicted for tennessine. The difference between the 7p1/2 and 7p3/2 levels is abnormally high; 9.8\u00a0eV. Astatine's 6p subshell split is only 3.8\u00a0eV, and its 6p1/2 chemistry has already been called \"limited\". These effects cause tennessine's chemistry to differ from those of its upper neighbors (see below).\nTennessine's first ionization energy\u2014the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom\u2014is predicted to be 7.7\u00a0eV, lower than those of the halogens, again following the trend. Like its neighbors in the periodic table, tennessine is expected to have the lowest electron affinity\u2014energy released when an electron is added to the atom\u2014in its group; 2.6 or 1.8\u00a0eV. The electron of the hypothetical hydrogen-like tennessine atom\u2014oxidized so it has only one electron, Ts116+\u2014is predicted to move so quickly that its mass is 1.90 times that of a non-moving electron, a feature attributable to relativistic effects. For comparison, the figure for hydrogen-like astatine is 1.27 and the figure for hydrogen-like iodine is 1.08. Simple extrapolations of relativity laws indicate a contraction of atomic radius. Advanced calculations show that the radius of a tennessine atom that has formed one covalent bond would be 165\u00a0pm, while that of astatine would be 147\u00a0pm. With the seven outermost electrons removed, tennessine is finally smaller; 57\u00a0pm for tennessine and 61\u00a0pm for astatine.\nThe melting and boiling points of tennessine are not known; earlier papers predicted about 350\u2013500\u00a0\u00b0C and 550\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively, or 350\u2013550\u00a0\u00b0C and 610\u00a0\u00b0C, respectively. These values exceed those of astatine and the lighter halogens, following periodic trends. A later paper predicts the boiling point of tennessine to be 345\u00a0\u00b0C (that of astatine is estimated as 309\u00a0\u00b0C, 337\u00a0\u00b0C, or 370\u00a0\u00b0C, although experimental values of 230\u00a0\u00b0C and 411\u00a0\u00b0C have been reported). The density of tennessine is expected to be between 7.1 and 7.3\u00a0g/cm3.\nChemical.\nThe known isotopes of tennessine, 293Ts and 294Ts, are too short-lived to allow for chemical experimentation at present. Nevertheless, many chemical properties of tennessine have been calculated. Unlike the lighter group 17 elements, tennessine may not exhibit the chemical behavior common to the halogens. For example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine routinely accept an electron to achieve the more stable electronic configuration of a noble gas, obtaining eight electrons (octet) in their valence shells instead of seven. This ability weakens as atomic weight increases going down the group; tennessine would be the least willing group 17 element to accept an electron. Of the oxidation states it is predicted to form, \u22121 is expected to be the least common. The standard reduction potential of the Ts/Ts\u2212 couple is predicted to be \u22120.25\u00a0V; this value is negative, unlike for all the lighter halogens.\nThere is another opportunity for tennessine to complete its octet\u2014by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet they are expected to form a Ts\u2013Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine is predicted to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2. The molecule tennessine chloride (TsCl) is predicted to go further, being bonded with a single pi bond.\nAside from the unstable \u22121 state, three more oxidation states are predicted; +5, +3, and +1. The +1 state should be especially stable because of the destabilization of the three outermost 7p3/2 electrons, forming a stable, half-filled subshell configuration; astatine shows similar effects. The +3 state should be important, again due to the destabilized 7p3/2 electrons. The +5 state is predicted to be uncommon because the 7p1/2 electrons are oppositely stabilized. The +7 state has not been shown\u2014even computationally\u2014to be achievable. Because the 7s electrons are greatly stabilized, it has been hypothesized that tennessine effectively has only five valence electrons.\nThe simplest possible tennessine compound would be the monohydride, TsH. The bonding is expected to be provided by a 7p3/2 electron of tennessine and the 1s electron of hydrogen. The non-bonding nature of the 7p1/2 spinor is because tennessine is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds. Therefore, the destabilized (thus expanded) 7p3/2 spinor is responsible for bonding. This effect lengthens the TsH molecule by 17\u00a0picometers compared with the overall length of 195\u00a0pm. Since the tennessine p electron bonds are two-thirds sigma, the bond is only two-thirds as strong as it would be if tennessine featured no spin\u2013orbit interactions. The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides, showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH. The molecules TlTs and NhTs may be viewed analogously, taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element's p1/2 electrons are stabilized. These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment (product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms) for TlTs; only 1.67\u00a0D, the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the tennessine atom. For NhTs, the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the tennessine atom to the nihonium atom, with the dipole moment value being \u22121.80\u00a0D. The spin\u2013orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the TsF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of tennessine, causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character. Tennessine monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 monofluorides.\nVSEPR theory predicts a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry for the group 17 trifluorides. All known halogen trifluorides have this molecular geometry and have a structure of AX3E2\u2014a central atom, denoted A, surrounded by three ligands, X, and two unshared electron pairs, E. If relativistic effects are ignored, TsF3 should follow its lighter congeners in having a bent-T-shaped molecular geometry. More sophisticated predictions show that this molecular geometry would not be energetically favored for TsF3, predicting instead a trigonal planar molecular geometry (AX3E0). This shows that VSEPR theory may not be consistent for the superheavy elements. The TsF3 molecule is predicted to be significantly stabilized by spin\u2013orbit interactions; a possible rationale may be the large difference in electronegativity between tennessine and fluorine, giving the bond a partially ionic character.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\n* "}

They are distributed over most of the Northern Hemisphere, inhabiting the temperate and tropical-montane regions of North America and Eurasia, ranging southward in Western Asia to Iran, in Africa to Libya, and in Southeast Asia into Indonesia.\nElms are components of many kinds of natural forests. Moreover, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, many species and cultivars were also planted as ornamental street, garden, and park trees in Europe, North America, and parts of the Southern Hemisphere, notably Australasia. Some individual elms reached great size and age. However, in recent decades, most mature elms of European or North American origin have died from Dutch elm disease, caused by a microfungus dispersed by bark beetles. In response, disease-resistant cultivars have been developed, capable of restoring the elm to forestry and landscaping.\nDescription.\nThe genus is hermaphroditic, having apetalous perfect flowers which are wind-pollinated. Elm leaves are alternate, with simple, single- or, most commonly, doubly serrate margins, usually asymmetric at the base and acuminate at the apex. The fruit is a round wind-dispersed samara flushed with chlorophyll, facilitating photosynthesis before the leaves emerge. The samarae are very light, those of British elms numbering around 50,000 to the pound (454 g). (Very rarely anomalous samarae occur with more than two wings.) All species are tolerant of a wide range of soils and pH levels but, with few exceptions, demand good drainage. The elm tree can grow to great height, the American elm in excess of , often with a forked trunk creating a vase profile.\nTaxonomy.\nThere are about 30 to 40 species of \"Ulmus\"; the ambiguity in number results from difficulty in delineating species, owing to the ease of hybridization between them and the development of local seed-sterile vegetatively propagated microspecies in some areas, mainly in the field elm (\"Ulmus minor\") group. Oliver Rackham describes \"Ulmus\" as the most critical genus in the entire British flora, adding that 'species and varieties are a distinction in the human mind rather than a measured degree of genetic variation'. Eight species are endemic to North America and three to Europe, but the greatest diversity is in Asia with approximately two dozen species. The oldest fossils of \"Ulmus\" are leaves dating Paleocene, found across the Northern Hemisphere.\nThe classification adopted in the List of elm species is largely based on that established by Brummitt. A large number of synonyms have accumulated over the last three centuries; their currently accepted names can be found in the list of Elm synonyms and accepted names.\nBotanists who study elms and argue over elm identification and classification are called \"pteleologists\", from the Greek \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1 (elm).\nAs part of the urticalean rosid clade, formerly order Urticales, they are distantly related to cannabis, mulberries, figs, hops, and nettles.\nEcology.\nPropagation.\nElm propagation methods vary according to elm type and location, and the plantsman's needs. Native species may be propagated by seed. In their natural setting, native species, such as wych elm and European white elm in central and northern Europe and field elm in southern Europe, set viable seed in \"favourable\" seasons. Optimal conditions occur after a late warm spring. After pollination, seeds of spring-flowering elms ripen and fall at the start of summer (June); they remain viable for only a few days. They are planted in sandy potting soil at a depth of 1\u00a0cm, and germinate in three weeks. Slow-germinating American elm will remain dormant until the second season. Seeds from autumn-flowering elms ripen in the fall and germinate in the spring. Since elms may hybridize within and between species, seed propagation entails a hybridisation risk. In unfavourable seasons, elm seeds are usually sterile. Elms outside their natural range, such as English elm \"U. minor\" 'Atinia', and elms unable to pollinate because pollen sources are genetically identical, are sterile and are propagated by vegetative reproduction. Vegetative reproduction is also used to produce genetically identical elms (clones). Methods include the winter transplanting of root suckers; taking hardwood cuttings from vigorous one-year-old shoots in late winter, taking root cuttings in early spring; taking softwood cuttings in early summer; grafting; ground and air layering; and micropropagation. A bottom heat of 18\u00a0\u00b0C and humid conditions are maintained for hard- and softwood cuttings. The transplanting of root suckers remains the easiest and most common propagation method for European field elm and its hybrids. For specimen urban elms, grafting to wych-elm rootstock may be used to eliminate suckering or to ensure stronger root growth. The mutant-elm cultivars are usually grafted, the \"weeping\" elms 'Camperdown' and 'Horizontalis' at , the dwarf cultivars 'Nana' and 'Jacqueline Hillier' at ground level. Since the Siberian elm is drought tolerant, in dry countries, new varieties of elm are often root-grafted onto this species. \nPests and diseases.\nDutch elm disease.\nDutch elm disease (DED) devastated elms throughout Europe and much of North America in the second half of the 20th century. It derives its name \"Dutch\" from the first description of the disease and its cause in the 1920s by Dutch botanists Bea Schwarz and Christina Johanna Buisman. Owing to its geographical isolation and effective quarantine enforcement, Australia has so far remained unaffected by DED, as have the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia in western Canada.\nDED is caused by a microfungus transmitted by two species of \"Scolytus\" elm-bark beetles, which act as vectors. The disease affects all species of elms native to North America and Europe, but many Asiatic species have evolved antifungal genes and are resistant. Fungal spores, introduced into wounds in the tree caused by the beetles, invade the xylem or vascular system. The tree responds by producing tyloses, effectively blocking the flow from roots to leaves. Woodland trees in North America are not quite as susceptible to the disease because they usually lack the root grafting of the urban elms and are somewhat more isolated from each other. In France, inoculation with the fungus of over 300 clones of the European species failed to find a single variety that possessed of any significant resistance.\nThe first, less aggressive strain of the disease fungus, \"Ophiostoma ulmi\", arrived in Europe from Asia in 1910, and was accidentally introduced to North America in 1928. It was steadily weakened by viruses in Europe and had all but disappeared by the 1940s. However, the disease had a much greater and longer-lasting impact in North America, owing to the greater susceptibility of the American elm, \"Ulmus americana\", which masked the emergence of the second, far more virulent strain of the disease \"Ophiostoma novo-ulmi\". It appeared in the United States sometime in the 1940s, and was originally believed to be a mutation of \"O. ulmi\". Limited gene flow from \"O. ulmi\" to \"O. novo-ulmi\" was probably responsible for the creation of the North American subspecies \"O. novo-ulmi\" subsp. \"americana\". It was first recognized in Britain in the early 1970s, believed to have been introduced via a cargo of Canadian rock elm destined for the boatbuilding industry, and rapidly eradicated most of the mature elms from western Europe. A second subspecies, \"O. novo-ulmi\" subsp. \"novo-ulmi\", caused similar devastation in Eastern and Central Europe. This subspecies, which was introduced to North America, and like \"O. ulmi\", is thought to have originated in Asia. The two subspecies have now hybridized in Europe where their ranges have overlapped. The hypothesis that \"O. novo-ulmi\" arose from a hybrid of the original \"O. ulmi\" and another strain endemic to the Himalayas, \"Ophiostoma himal-ulmi\", is now discredited.\nNo sign indicates the current pandemic is waning, and no evidence has been found of a susceptibility of the fungus to a disease of its own caused by d-factors: naturally occurring virus-like agents that severely debilitated the original \"O. ulmi\" and reduced its sporulation.\nElm phloem necrosis.\nElm phloem necrosis (elm yellows) is a disease of elm trees that is spread by leafhoppers or by root grafts. This very aggressive disease, with no known cure, occurs in the Eastern United States, southern Ontario in Canada, and Europe. It is caused by phytoplasmas that infect the phloem (inner bark) of the tree. Infection and death of the phloem effectively girdles the tree and stops the flow of water and nutrients. The disease affects both wild-growing and cultivated trees.\nOccasionally, cutting the infected tree before the disease completely establishes itself and cleanup and prompt disposal of infected matter has resulted in the plant's survival via stump sprouts.\nInsects.\nMost serious of the elm pests is the elm leaf beetle \"Xanthogaleruca luteola\", which can decimate foliage, although rarely with fatal results. The beetle was accidentally introduced to North America from Europe. Another unwelcome immigrant to North America is the Japanese beetle \"Popillia japonica\". In both instances, the beetles cause far more damage in North America owing to the absence of the predators in their native lands. In Australia, introduced elm trees are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of hepialid moths of the genus \"Aenetus\". These burrow horizontally into the trunk then vertically down. Circa 2000, the Asian Zig-zag sawfly \"Aproceros leucopoda\" appeared in Europe and North America, although in England, its impact has been minimal and it is no longer monitored.\nBirds.\nSapsucker woodpeckers have a great love of young elm trees. \nCultivation.\nOne of the earliest of ornamental elms was the ball-headed graft narvan elm, \"Ulmus minor\" 'Umbraculifera', cultivated from time immemorial in Persia as a shade tree and widely planted in cities through much of south-west and central Asia. From the 18th century to the early 20th century, elms, whether species, hybrids, or cultivars, were among the most widely planted ornamental trees in both Europe and North America. They were particularly popular as a street tree in avenue plantings in towns and cities, creating high-tunnelled effects. Their quick growth and variety of foliage and forms, their tolerance of air-pollution, and the comparatively rapid decomposition of their leaf litter in the fall were further advantages.\nIn North America, the species most commonly planted was the American elm (\"U. americana\"), which had unique properties that made it ideal for such use - rapid growth, adaptation to a broad range of climates and soils, strong wood, resistance to wind damage, and vase-like growth habit requiring minimal pruning. In Europe, the wych elm (\"U. glabra\") and the field elm (\"U. minor\") were the most widely planted in the countryside, the former in northern areas including Scandinavia and northern Britain, the latter further south. The hybrid between these two, Dutch elm (\"U. \u00d7 hollandica\"), occurs naturally and was also commonly planted. In much of England, the English elm later came to dominate the horticultural landscape. Most commonly planted in hedgerows, it sometimes occurred in densities over 1000/km2. In south-eastern Australia and New Zealand, large numbers of English and Dutch elms, as well as other species and cultivars, were planted as ornamentals following their introduction in the 19th century, while in northern Japan Japanese elm (\"U. davidiana\" var. \"japonica\") was widely planted as a street tree. From about 1850 to 1920, the most prized small ornamental elm in parks and gardens was the 'Camperdown' elm (\"U. glabra\" 'Camperdownii'), a contorted, weeping cultivar of the wych elm grafted on to a nonweeping elm trunk to give a wide, spreading, and weeping fountain shape in large garden spaces.\nIn northern Europe, elms were among the few trees tolerant of saline deposits from sea spray, which can cause \"salt-burning\" and die-back. This tolerance made elms reliable both as shelterbelt trees exposed to sea wind, in particular along the coastlines of southern and western Britain and in the Low Countries, and as trees for coastal towns and cities.\nThis \"belle \u00e9poque\" lasted until the First World War, when the elm began its slide into horticultural decline. The impact of the hostilities on Germany, the origin of at least 40 cultivars, coincided with an outbreak of the early strain of DED, \"Ophiostoma ulmi\". The devastation caused by the Second World War, and the demise in 1944 of the huge Sp\u00e4th nursery in Berlin, only accelerated the process. The outbreak of the new, three times more virulent, strain of DED \"Ophiostoma novo-ulmi\" in the late 1960s, brought the tree to its nadir.\nSince around 1990, the elm has enjoyed a renaissance through the successful development in North America and Europe of cultivars highly resistant to DED. Consequently, the total number of named cultivars, ancient and modern, now exceeds 300, although many of the older clones, possibly over 120, have been lost to cultivation. Some of the latter, however, were by today's standards inadequately described or illustrated before the pandemic, and a number may survive, or have regenerated, unrecognised. Enthusiasm for the newer clones often remains low owing to the poor performance of earlier, supposedly disease-resistant Dutch trees released in the 1960s and 1970s. In the Netherlands, sales of elm cultivars slumped from over 56,000 in 1989 to just 6,800 in 2004, whilst in the UK, only four of the new American and European releases were commercially available in 2008.\nEfforts to develop DED-resistant cultivars began in the Netherlands in 1928 and continued, uninterrupted by World War II, until 1992. Similar programmes were initiated in North America (1937), Italy (1978) and Spain (1986). Research has followed two paths:\nSpecies and species cultivars.\nIn North America, careful selection has produced a number of trees resistant not only to DED, but also to the droughts and cold winters that occur on the continent. Research in the United States has concentrated on the American elm (\"U. americana\"), resulting in the release of DED-resistant clones, notably the cultivars 'Valley Forge' and 'Jefferson'. Much work has also been done into the selection of disease-resistant Asiatic species and cultivars.\nIn 1993, Mariam B. Sticklen and Mark G. Bolyard reported the results of experiments funded by the US National Park Service and conducted at Michigan State University in East Lansing that were designed to apply genetic engineering techniques to the development of DED-resistant strains of American elm trees. In 2007, A. E. Newhouse and F. Schrodt of the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse reported that young transgenic American elm trees had shown reduced DED symptoms and normal mycorrhizal colonization.\nIn Europe, the European white elm (\"U. laevis\") has received much attention. While this elm has little innate resistance to DED, it is not favoured by the vector bark beetles. Thus it becomes colonized and infected only when no other elms are available, a rare situation in western Europe. Research in Spain has suggested that it may be the presence of a triterpene, alnulin, which makes the tree bark unattractive to the beetle species that spread the disease. This possibility, though, has not been conclusively proven. More recently, field elms \"Ulmus minor\" highly resistant to DED have been discovered in Spain, and form the basis of a major breeding programme.\nHybrid cultivars.\nOwing to their innate resistance to DED, Asiatic species have been crossed with European species, or with other Asiatic elms, to produce trees that are both highly resistant to disease and tolerant of native climates. After a number of false dawns in the 1970s, this approach has produced a range of reliable hybrid cultivars now commercially available in North America and Europe. Disease resistance is invariably carried by the female parent.\nSome of these cultivars, notably those with the Siberian elm (\"Ulmus pumila\") in their ancestry, lack the forms for which the iconic American elm and English elm were prized. Moreover, several exported to northwestern Europe have proven unsuited to the maritime climate conditions there, notably because of their intolerance of anoxic conditions resulting from ponding on poorly drained soils in winter. Dutch hybridizations invariably included the Himalayan elm (\"Ulmus wallichiana\") as a source of antifungal genes and have proven more tolerant of wet ground; they should also ultimately reach a greater size. However, the susceptibility of the cultivar 'Lobel', used as a control in Italian trials, to elm yellows has now (2014) raised a question mark over all the Dutch clones.\nSeveral highly resistant \"Ulmus\" cultivars have been released since 2000 by the Institute of Plant Protection in Florence, most commonly featuring crosses of the Dutch cultivar 'Plantijn' with the Siberian elm to produce resistant trees better adapted to the Mediterranean climate.\nCautions regarding novel cultivars.\nElms take many decades to grow to maturity, and as the introduction of these disease-resistant cultivars is relatively recent, their long-term performance and ultimate size and form cannot be predicted with certainty. The National Elm Trial in North America, begun in 2005, is a nationwide trial to assess strengths and weaknesses of the 19 leading cultivars raised in the US over a 10-year period; European cultivars have been excluded. Meanwhile, in Europe, American and European cultivars are being assessed in field trials started in 2000 by the UK charity Butterfly Conservation.\nLandscaped parks.\nCentral Park.\nThe oldest American elm trees in New York City's Central Park were planted in the 1860s by Frederick Law Olmsted, making them among the oldest stands of American elms in the world. Along the Mall and Literary Walk four lines of American elms stretch over the walkway forming a cathedral-like covering. A part of New York City's urban ecology, the elms improve air and water quality, reduce erosion and flooding, and decrease air temperatures during warm days.\nWhile the stand is still vulnerable to DED, in the 1980s the Central Park Conservancy undertook aggressive countermeasures such as heavy pruning and removal of extensively diseased trees. These efforts have largely been successful in saving the majority of the trees, although several are still lost each year. Younger American elms that have been planted in Central Park since the outbreak are of the DED-resistant 'Princeton' and 'Valley Forge' cultivars.\nNational Mall.\nSeveral rows of American elm trees that the National Park Service (NPS) first planted during the 1930s line much of the of the National Mall in Washington, DC. DED first appeared on the trees during the 1950s and reached a peak in the 1970s. The NPS used a number of methods to control the epidemic, including sanitation, pruning, injecting trees with fungicide, and replanting with DED-resistant cultivars. The NPS combated the disease's local insect vector, the smaller European elm bark beetle (\"Scolytus multistriatus\"), by trapping and by spraying with insecticides. As a result, the population of American elms planted on the Mall and its surrounding areas has remained intact for more than 80 years.\nUses.\nWood.\nElm wood is valued for its interlocking grain, and consequent resistance to splitting, with significant uses in wagon-wheel hubs, chair seats, and coffins. The bodies of Japanese \"Taiko\" drums are often cut from the wood of old elm trees, as the wood's resistance to splitting is highly desired for nailing the skins to them, and a set of three or more is often cut from the same tree. The elm's wood bends well and distorts easily. The often long, straight trunks were favoured as a source of timber for keels in ship construction. Elm is also prized by bowyers; of the ancient bows found in Europe, a large portion are elm. During the Middle Ages, elm was also used to make longbows if yew was unavailable.\nThe first written references to elm occur in the Linear B lists of military equipment at Knossos in the Mycenaean period. Several of the chariots are of elm (\"\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5-\u03c1\u03b5-\u03dd\u03b1\", \"pte-re-wa\"), and the lists twice mention wheels of elmwood. Hesiod says that ploughs in Ancient Greece were also made partly of elm.\nThe density of elm wood varies between species, but averages around 560\u00a0kg/m3.\nElm wood is also resistant to decay when permanently wet, and hollowed trunks were widely used as water pipes during the medieval period in Europe. Elm was also used as piers in the construction of the original London Bridge, but this resistance to decay in water does not extend to ground contact.\nViticulture.\nThe Romans, and more recently, Italians, planted elms in vineyards as supports for vines. Lopped at 3 m, the elms' quick growth, twiggy lateral branches, light shade, and root suckering made them ideal trees for this purpose. The lopped branches were used for fodder and firewood. Ovid in his \"Amores\" characterizes the elm as \"loving the vine\": \"ulmus amat vitem, vitis non deserit ulmum\" (the elm loves the vine, the vine does not desert the elm), and the ancients spoke of the \"marriage\" between elm and vine.\nMedicinal products.\nThe mucilaginous inner bark of the slippery elm (\"Ulmus rubra\") has long been used as a demulcent, and is still produced commercially for this purpose in the US with approval for sale as a nutritional supplement by the Food and Drug Administration.\nFodder.\nElms also have a long history of cultivation for fodder, with the leafy branches cut to feed livestock. The practice continues today in the Himalaya, where it contributes to serious deforestation.\nBiomass.\nAs fossil fuel resources diminish, increasing attention is being paid to trees as sources of energy. In Italy, the Istituto per la Protezione delle Piante is (2012) in the process of releasing to commerce very fast-growing elm cultivars, able to increase in height by more than per year.\nFood.\nElm bark, cut into strips and boiled, sustained much of the rural population of Norway during the great famine of 1812. The seeds are particularly nutritious, containing 45% crude protein, and less than 7% fibre by dry mass.\nAlternative medicine.\nElm has been listed as one of the 38 substances that are used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine.\nBonsai.\nChinese elm (\"Ulmus parvifolia\") is a popular choice for bonsai owing to its tolerance of severe pruning.\nGenetic resource conservation.\nIn 1997, a European Union elm project was initiated, its aim to coordinate the conservation of all the elm genetic resources of the member states and, among other things, to assess their resistance to Dutch elm disease. Accordingly, over 300 clones were selected and propagated for testing.\nCulture.\nNotable elm trees.\nMany elm trees of various kinds have attained great size or otherwise become particularly noteworthy.\nIn art.\nMany artists have admired elms for the ease and grace of their branching and foliage, and have painted them with sensitivity. Elms are a recurring element in the landscapes and studies of, for example, John Constable, Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller, Alfred East, George Clausen, Frederick Childe Hassam, Karel Klinkenberg, and George Inness.\nIn mythology and literature.\nIn Greek mythology, the nymph Ptelea (\u03a0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1, Elm) was one of the eight hamadryads, nymphs of the forest and daughters of Oxylos and Hamadryas. In his \"Hymn to Artemis\", poet Callimachus (third century BC) tells how, at the age of three, the infant goddess Artemis practised her newly acquired silver bow and arrows, made for her by Hephaestus and the Cyclopes, by shooting first at an elm, then at an oak, before turning her aim on a wild animal:\n\u03c0\u03c1\u1ff6\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u1f27\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03b4\u03c1\u1fe6\u03bd, \u03c4\u1f78 \u03c4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u1f56\u03c4\u1fbd \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03b8\u1fc6\u03c1\u03b1.\nThe first reference in literature to elms occurs in the \"Iliad\". When Eetion, father of Andromache, is killed by Achilles during the Trojan War, the mountain nymphs plant elms on his tomb (\"\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1\u03c2 \u1f10\u03c6\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03bd\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f40\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03bao\u1fe6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9 \u0394\u03b9\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u03b3\u03b9\u03cc\u03c7o\u03b9o\").\nAlso in the \"Iliad\", when the River Scamander, indignant at the sight of so many corpses in his water, overflows and threatens to drown Achilles, the latter grasps a branch of a great elm in an attempt to save himself (\"\u1f41 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03bd \u1f15\u03bb\u03b5 \u03c7\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u1f76\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c6\u03c5\u03ad\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\").\nThe nymphs also planted elms on the tomb in the Thracian Chersonese of \"great-hearted Protesilaus\" (\"\u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03bf\u03c5\"), the first Greek to fall in the Trojan War. These elms grew to be the tallest in the known world, but when their topmost branches saw far off the ruins of Troy, they immediately withered, so great still was the bitterness of the hero buried below, who had been loved by Laodamia and slain by Hector. The story is the subject of a poem by Antiphilus of Byzantium (first century AD) in the Palatine Anthology:\n\u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u1f72 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c3\u03af\u03bb\u03b1\u03b5, \u03c3\u1f72 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f84\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u1f30\u03ce\u03bd,\nT\u03c1o\u03af\u1fb3 \u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bbo\u03bc\u03ad\u03bdo\u03c5 \u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c1\u03be\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bdo\u03bd\u2022\n\u03c3\u1fb6\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u03c6\u1f72\u03c2 \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bao\u03bc\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c3\u03b7\nN\u03cd\u03bc\u03c6\u03b1\u03b9, \u1f00\u03c0\u03b5\u03c7\u03b8o\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03afo\u03c5 \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03c2.\n\u0394\u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03b4\u03c5\u03c3\u03bc\u03ae\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1, \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f24\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c7o\u03c2 \u1f34\u03b4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\nT\u03c1\u03ce\u03ca\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b1\u1f50\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03b7\u03bd \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c7o\u03b5\u1fe6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7\u03bd.\n\u1f45\u03c3\u03c3o\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f21\u03c1\u03ce\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9 \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u1fbd \u1f26\u03bd \u03c7\u03cc\u03bbo\u03c2, o\u1f57 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1o\u03c2 \u1f00\u03ba\u03bc\u1f74\u03bd\n\u1f10\u03c7\u03b8\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03c8\u03cd\u03c7o\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ce\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u1f00\u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03bco\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.\n[:Thessalian Protesilaos, a long age shall sing your praises,\nOf the destined dead at Troy the first;\nYour tomb with thick-foliaged elms they covered,\nThe nymphs, across the water from hated Ilion.\nTrees full of anger; and whenever that wall they see,\nOf Troy, the leaves in their upper crown wither and fall.\nSo great in the heroes was the bitterness then, some of which still\nRemembers, hostile, in the soulless upper branches.]\nProtesilaus had been king of Pteleos () in Thessaly, which took its name from the abundant elms () in the region.\nElms occur often in pastoral poetry, where they symbolise the idyllic life, their shade being mentioned as a place of special coolness and peace. In the first Idyll of Theocritus (third century BC), for example, the goatherd invites the shepherd to sit \"here beneath the elm\" (\"\u03b4\u03b5\u1fe6\u03c1' \u1f51\u03c0\u1f78 \u03c4\u1f70\u03bd \u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03b1\u03bd\") and sing. Beside elms, Theocritus places \"the sacred water\" (\"\") of the Springs of the Nymphs and the shrines to the nymphs.\nAside from references literal and metaphorical to the elm and vine theme, the tree occurs in Latin literature in the Elm of Dreams in the Aeneid. When the Sibyl of Cumae leads Aeneas down to the Underworld, one of the sights is the Stygian Elm:\nIn medio ramos annosaque bracchia pandit\nulmus opaca, ingens, quam sedem somnia vulgo\nuana tenere ferunt, foliisque sub omnibus haerent.\n[:Spreads in the midst her boughs and ag\u00e9d arms\nan elm, huge, shadowy, where vain dreams, 'tis said,\nare wont to roost them, under every leaf close-clinging.]\nVirgil refers to a Roman superstition (\"vulgo\") that elms were trees of ill-omen because their fruit seemed to be of no value. It has been noted that two elm-motifs have arisen from classical literature: (1) the 'Paradisal Elm' motif, arising from pastoral idylls and the elm-and-vine theme, and (2) the 'Elm and Death' motif, perhaps arising from Homer's commemorative elms and Virgil's Stygian Elm. Many references to elm in European literature from the Renaissance onwards fit into one or other of these categories.\nThere are two examples of \"pteleogenesis\" (:birth from elms) in world myths. In Germanic and Scandinavian mythology the first woman, Embla, was fashioned from an elm,\nwhile in Japanese mythology Kamuy Fuchi, the chief goddess of the Ainu people, \"was born from an elm impregnated by the Possessor of the Heavens\".\nThe elm occurs frequently in English literature, one of the best known instances being in Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", where Titania, Queen of the Fairies, addresses her beloved Nick Bottom using an elm-simile. Here, as often in the elm-and-vine motif, the elm is a masculine symbol:\nSleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.\n... the female Ivy so\nEnrings the barky fingers of the Elm.\nO, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!\nAnother of the most famous kisses in English literature, that of Paul and Helen at the start of Forster's \"Howards End\", is stolen beneath a great wych elm.\nThe elm tree is also referenced in children's literature. \"An Elm Tree and Three Sisters\" by Norma Sommerdorf is a children's book about three young sisters who plant a small elm tree in their backyard.\nIn politics.\nThe cutting of the elm was a diplomatic altercation between the kings of France and England in 1188, during which an elm tree near Gisors in Normandy was felled.\nIn politics, the elm is associated with revolutions. In England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the final victory of parliamentarians over monarchists, and the arrival from Holland, with William III and Mary II, of the Dutch elm hybrid, planting of this cultivar became a fashion among enthusiasts of the new political order.\nIn the American Revolution, the Liberty Tree was an American white elm in Boston, Massachusetts, in front of which, from 1765, the first resistance meetings were held against British attempts to tax the American colonists without democratic representation. When the British, knowing that the tree was a symbol of rebellion, felled it in 1775, the Americans took to widespread Liberty Elm planting, and sewed elm symbols on to their revolutionary flags. Elm planting by American Presidents later became something of a tradition.\nIn the French Revolution, too, \"Les arbres de la libert\u00e9\" (Liberty Trees), often elms, were planted as symbols of revolutionary hopes, the first in Vienne, Is\u00e8re, in 1790, by a priest inspired by the Boston elm. \"L'Orme de La Madeleine\" (:the Elm of La Madeleine), Faycelles, D\u00e9partement de Lot, planted around 1790 and surviving to this day, was a case in point. By contrast, a famous Parisian elm associated with the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\", \"L'Orme de Saint-Gervais\" in the Place St-Gervais, was \"felled\" by the revolutionaries; church authorities planted a new elm in its place in 1846, and an early 20th-century elm stands on the site today. Premier Lionel Jospin, obliged by tradition to plant a tree in the garden of the H\u00f4tel Matignon, the official residence and workplace of Prime Ministers of France, insisted on planting an elm, so-called 'tree of the Left', choosing the new disease-resistant hybrid 'Clone 762' (\"Ulmus\" 'Wanoux' = Vada). In the French Republican Calendar, in use from 1792 to 1806, the 12th day of the month Vent\u00f4se (= 2 March) was officially named \"jour de l'Orme\", Day of the Elm.\nLiberty Elms were also planted in other countries in Europe to celebrate their revolutions, an example being \"L'Olmo di Montepaone, L'Albero della Libert\u00e0\" (:the Elm of Montepaone, Liberty Tree) in Montepaone, Calabria, planted in 1799 to commemorate the founding of the democratic Parthenopean Republic, and surviving until it was brought down by a recent storm (it has since been cloned and 'replanted'). After the Greek Revolution of 1821\u201332, a thousand young elms were brought to Athens from Missolonghi, \"Sacred City of the Struggle\" against the Turks and scene of Lord Byron's death, and planted in 1839\u201340 in the National Garden. In an ironic development, feral elms have spread and invaded the grounds of the abandoned Greek royal summer palace at Tatoi in Attica.\nIn a chance event linking elms and revolution, on the morning of his execution (30 January 1649), walking to the scaffold at the Palace of Whitehall, King Charles I turned to his guards and pointed out, with evident emotion, an elm near the entrance to Spring Gardens that had been planted by his brother in happier days. The tree was said to be still standing in the 1860s.\nIn local history and place names.\nThe name of what is now the London neighbourhood of Seven Sisters is derived from seven elms which stood there at the time when it was a rural area, planted a circle with a walnut tree at their centre, and traceable on maps back to 1619.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The country's population density is of 16.9 people per square kilometer of land area - well below the world average of 62 people. Argentina's population growth rate in 2023 was estimated to be 0.23% annually, with a birth rate of 9.9 per 1,000 inhabitants and a mortality rate of 7.6 per 1,000 inhabitants.\nThe proportion of people under 15, at 20%, is well below the world average (25%), and the cohort of people 65 and older is relatively high, at 12%. The percentage of senior citizens in Argentina has long been second only to Uruguay in Latin America and well above the world average, which is currently 9.8%.\nThe median age is approximately 34 years, and life expectancy at birth is of 78 years. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines speak English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension), 9.3% speak Portuguese and 5.9% speak Italian.\nPopulation size and structure.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSources: Pantelides and National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina\nCities.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nArgentina is highly urbanized, with the ten largest metropolitan areas accounting for half of the population, and fewer than one in ten living in rural areas. About 3\u00a0million people live in Buenos Aires proper, and including suburban Greater Buenos Aires the metropolitan area totals around 14\u00a0million - making it one of the 15 largest urban areas in the world. The metropolitan areas of C\u00f3rdoba and Rosario have around 1.3\u00a0million inhabitants each, and six other cities (Mendoza, Tucum\u00e1n, La Plata, Mar del Plata, Salta and Santa Fe) have at least half a million people each.\nThe population is unequally distributed amongst the provinces, with 61% living in the Pampa region (21% of the total area), including 17.5\u00a0million people in Buenos Aires Province, 4\u00a0million in C\u00f3rdoba Province, and over 3\u00a0million each in Santa Fe Province and the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. Eight other provinces each have over one million people: Mendoza, Tucum\u00e1n, Salta, Entre R\u00edos, Misiones, Corrientes, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. Tucum\u00e1n is the most densely populated (with 75 inhabitants/km2, the only Argentine province more densely populated than the world average), while the southern province of Santa Cruz has just 1.4 inhabitant/km2.\nIn the mid-19th century, a large wave of immigration started to arrive to Argentina due to new constitutional policies that encouraged immigration, and issues in the countries the immigrants came from such as wars, poverty, hunger, famines, pursuit of a better life, among other reasons. The main immigration sources were from Europe, the countries from the Near and Middle East, Russia and Japan. In fact, the immigration torrent was so strong that Argentina eventually received the second-largest number of immigrants in the world, second only to the US and ahead of such immigrant receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.\nMost of these European immigrants settled in the cities which offered jobs, education and other opportunities enabling them to enter the middle class. Many also settled in the growing small towns along the expanding railway system and since the 1930s many rural workers have moved to the big cities.\nUrban areas reflect the influence of European immigration, and most of the larger ones feature boulevards and diagonal avenues inspired by the redevelopment of Paris. Argentine cities were originally built in a colonial Spanish grid style, centered on a plaza overlooked by a cathedral and important government buildings. Many still retain this general layout, known as a \"damero\", meaning checkerboard, since it is based on a pattern of square blocks. The city of La Plata, designed at the end of the 19th century by Pedro Benoit, combines the checkerboard layout with added diagonal avenues at fixed intervals, and was the first in South America with electric street lighting.\nProvinces and districts.\na Not including claims to the Islas Malvinas (Falkland Islands) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.\nStructure of the population.\nAccording to the total population was in - double the number in 1966 (for a 1.27% average annual growth rate in that period). The population below the age of 15 in 2022 was 22%, 66% was between 15 and 64, while 12% was 65 or older.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (18.V.2022): \n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Hidden begin/styles.css\"/&gt;Population by Sex and Age Group (27.X.2010): \nVital statistics.\nThe table below gives an overview of the number of birth and deaths in Argentina during the past century. Several sources were combined to compile the table.\nThe number of births in 2023 (460,902) was 41% below the record set in 2014, while the number of deaths was 353,428. As the population of Argentina showed a five-fold increase during the past century, the birth rate in 2023 (9.9) was a record low - now comparable to most European countries.\nDeath rates declined rapidly in the half century until around 1940 - then more gradually as the country's population aged. The death rate in 2023 (7.6) was near historic lows after having briefly risen in 2021 to the highest rate (9.5) since 1947 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBirth rates were relatively stable from 1934 through 1980, and after declining stabilized from 1995 to 2015 - before again declining sharply since then.\nNotable events in Argentine demographics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nTotal fertility rates by province.\nTotal fertility rate (TFR) in Argentina by province as of 2023:\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nUN estimates.\nThe Population Department of the United Nations prepared the following estimates of vital statistics of Argentina.\nArgentina's population continues to grow but at a slower rate because of its steadily declining birth rate. Argentina's fertility decline began earlier than in the rest of Latin America, occurring most rapidly between the early 20th century and the 1930s and then becoming more gradual.\nLife expectancy has been improving, most notably among the young and the poor.\nDemographic statistics according to the World Population Review.\nEthnic groups.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn colonial times, the ethnic composition of Argentina was the result of the interaction of the pre-Columbian indigenous population with a colonizing population of Spanish origin and with sub-Saharan African slaves. Before the middle 19th century, the ethnic make up of Argentina was very similar to that of other countries of Latin America. Between 1857 and 1950 Argentina was the country with the second biggest immigration wave in the world, at 6.6\u00a0million, second only to the United States in the numbers of immigrants received (27\u00a0million) and ahead of other areas of new settlement like Canada, Brazil and Australia. However, mass European immigration did not have the same impact in the whole country. According to the 1914 national census, 30% of Argentina's population was foreign-born, including 50% of the people in the city of Buenos Aires, but foreigners were only 2% in the provinces of Catamarca and La Rioja (North West region). Strikingly, at those times, the national population doubled every two decades. This belief is endured in the popular saying \"\" ('Argentines descend from the ships'). Therefore, most Argentines are descended from the 19th- and 20th-century immigrants of the great European immigration wave to Argentina (1850\u20131955), with a great majority of these immigrants coming from diverse European countries, particularly Italy and Spain.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nWhite Argentines.\nThere are no official census data or statistically significant studies on the precise number or percentage of hite Argentinians today, but it is known that they are by far the largest group.\nHowever, several ethnographic estimates have attempted to address the issue. According to an ethnic estimate by the UAEM for all Latin American countries, the white population of Argentina was 85% in 2005. Another estimate published in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica gives 89% (of which 86% would be white Europeans and 3% of Arab descent) in the year 2000. A recent estimate by the Joshua Project, updated to 2025, estimates 36,082,000 white Argentinians in a total population of 45,473,000, which is equivalent to 79.4% of the Argentinian population. Adjusted to the 46,735,004 inhabitants estimated by RENAPER, there would be a total of 37,109,200 white people in Argentina. \nIndigenous peoples.\nAccording to the data of INDEC's Complementary Survey of Indigenous Peoples (ECPI) 2004\u20132005, 600,000 officially recognized indigenous people (about 1.4% of the total population) reside in Argentina. The most numerous of these communities are the Mapuches, who live mostly in the south, the Kollas and Wich\u00eds, from the northwest, and the Guaranis and Qom, who live mostly in the northeast.\nIn the census of 2010, 955,032 people self recognized as indigenous or descendants of indigenous peoples, thus representing 2.4% of the national population. This is notwithstanding that more than half of the population has at least one indigenous ancestor, although in most cases family memory lost that origin.\nBlack Argentines.\nSince 2013, November 8 has been celebrated as the National Day of Afro-Argentines and African Culture. The date was chosen to commemorate the recorded date for the death of Mar\u00eda Remedios del Valle, a \"rabona\" and guerrilla fighter, who served with the Army of the North in the war of Independence.\nThe black population in Argentina declined since the middle 19th century from 15% of the total population in 1857 (Blacks and Mulatto people), to less than 0.5% at present (mainly mulattoes and immigrants from Cape Verde).\nAfro-Argentines were up to a third of the population during colonial times; most were slaves brought from Africa to work for the criollos. The 1813 Assembly abolished slavery and led to the Freedom of Wombs Law of 1813, which automatically freed slaves' children at birth. Many Afro-Argentines contributed to the independence of Argentina such as Mar\u00eda Remedios del Valle who is known as ('mother of the fatherland') and Sgt. Juan Bautista Cabral. Also there is a debate, among the historians, as to whether or not Bernardino Rivadavia, the first president of the United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata (Present Argentina) had African ancestors.\nImmigration to Argentina.\nEuropean settlement.\nAs with other areas of new settlement such as Canada, Australia, the United States, Brazil, and New Zealand, Argentina is considered a country of immigrants. By 1914, Argentina was only second to the United States in the number of immigrants received, ahead of Canada and Australia.\nIn the last national census, based on self-identification, 952,032 Argentines (2.4% of the population) declared to be Amerindians. Most of the 6.2\u00a0million European immigrants arriving between 1850 and 1950, regardless of origin, settled in several regions of the country. Due to this large-scale European immigration, Argentina's population more than doubled.\nThe majority of these European immigrants came from Spain and Italy.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France, Germany, England, Portugal, Brazil, Switzerland, Wales, Scotland, Poland, Albania, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, Russia, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Bulgaria, Armenia, Greece, Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia.\nItalian population in Argentina arrived mainly from the northern Italian regions varying between Piedmont, Veneto and Lombardy, later from Campania and Calabria;\nSpanish immigrants were mainly Galicians and Basques.\nThousands of immigrants also came from France (notably B\u00e9arn and the Northern Basque Country), Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Greece, Portugal, Finland, Russia and the United Kingdom. The Welsh settlement in Patagonia, known as \"Y Wladfa\", began in 1865; mainly along the coast of Chubut Province. In addition to the main colony in Chubut, a smaller colony was set up in Santa Fe and another group settled at Coronel Su\u00e1rez, southern Buenos Aires Province. Of the 50,000 Patagonians of Welsh descent, about 5,000 are Welsh speakers. The community is centered on the cities of Gaiman, Trelew and Trevelin.\nRecent immigrants.\nAccording to the INDEC 1,531,940 of the Argentine resident population in 2001 were born outside Argentina, representing 4.22% of the total Argentine resident population. In 2010, 1,805,957 of the Argentine resident population were born outside Argentina, representing 4.50% of the total Argentine resident population. As of July 2023, more than 18,500 Russians have come to Argentina after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\nIllegal immigration has been a recent factor in Argentine demographics. Most illegal immigrants come from Bolivia and Paraguay, countries which border Argentina to the north. Smaller numbers arrive from Peru and Ecuador.\nThe Argentine government estimates that 750,000 inhabitants lack official documents and has launched a program called \"Patria Grande\" (\"Greater Homeland\") to encourage illegal immigrants to regularize their status; so far over 670,000 applications have been processed under the program.\nLanguages.\nThe official language of Argentina is Spanish, and it is spoken by practically the entire population in several different accents. The most common variation of Spanish in Argentina is the Rioplatense Spanish (), and it is so named because it evolved in the central areas around the R\u00edo de la Plata basin. Its distinctive feature is widespread voseo, the use of the pronoun \"vos\" instead of \"t\u00fa\" for the second person singular. Additionally, the Argentinian accent sounds identical to Portuguese in the words that begin with 'll' or 'yo', and all the words in Portuguese that begin with 'ch'. For example, the following sentence English: What is your name? Portuguese: como se chama? Spanish: Como se llama? - 'chama' &amp; 'llama' are pronounced as though they were spelled \"Shama\"in both Argentinian Spanish and Portuguese. Moreover, the sound shift of all of the words in Spanish that begin with \"ll\" or 'y' but sound like 'sh' i.e., 'llorar' 'llama, 'llegar' &amp; 'yo'. In Portuguese the words that begin with 'ch' always sound like 'sh'. There are many more words like these shown above. The mutual intelligibility between Spanish and Portuguese is already high, but the 'sh' sound increases the intelligibility between both languages even more.\nNon-indigenous minority languages.\nMany Argentines also speak other European languages (Italian, German, Portuguese, French, Welsh, Swedish and Croatian, as examples) due to the vast number of immigrants from Europe that came to Argentina.\nEnglish language is a required subject in many schools, and there are also many private English-teaching academies and institutions. Young people have become accustomed to English through movies and the Internet, and knowledge of the language is also required in most jobs, so most middle-class children and teenagers now speak, read and/or understand it with various degrees of proficiency. According to an official cultural consumption survey conducted in 2006, 42.3% of Argentines claim to speak some English (though only 15.4% of those claimed to have a high level of English comprehension).\nThere are sources of around one million Levantine Arabic speakers in Argentina, as a result of immigration from the Middle East, mostly from Syria and Lebanon.\nStandard German is spoken by around 500,000 Argentines of German ancestry, though the number may be as high as 3,800,000 according to some sources. German is the third or fourth most spoken language in Argentina.\nThere is a prosperous community of Argentine Welsh-speakers of approximately 25,000 in the province of Chubut, in the Patagonia region, who descend from 19th century immigrants.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nThe Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but until 1994 the President and Vice President had to be Catholic. The society, culture, and politics of Argentina are deeply imbued with Roman Catholicism.\nEstimates for the number of Roman Catholics vary from 70% of the population, to as much as 90%. The CIA Factbook lists 92% of the country is Catholic, but only 20% are practicing regularly or weekly at a church service. The Jewish population is about 300,000 (around 0.75% of the population), the community numbered about 400,000 after World War II, but the appeal of Israel and economic and cultural pressures at home led many to leave; recent instability in Israel has resulted in a modest reversal of the trend since 2003. Muslim Argentines number about 500,000\u2013600,000, or approximately 1.5% of the population; 93% of them are Sunni. Buenos Aires is home to one of the largest mosques in Latin America. A study from 2010 found that approximately 11% of Argentines are non-religious, including those who believe in God, though not religion, agnostics (4%) and atheists (5%). Overall, 24% attended religious services regularly. Protestants were the only group in which a majority regularly attended services.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Argentine National Congress. The Judiciary is independent, as are the Executive and the Legislature. Elections take place regularly on a multi-party system.\nIn the 20th century, Argentina experienced significant political turmoil and democratic reversals. Argentina's first episode of democratization started with the 1912 Argentine legislative election and ended with the 1930 Argentine coup d'\u00e9tat. Between 1930 and 1976, the armed forces overthrew six governments in Argentina. Some historians see between military rule and periods of restricted democracy also periods of democracy (1946\u20131955, and 1973\u20131976), while other sources only consider the period 1963\u20131965 as barely meeting the standards of democratic transition.\nFollowing a democratization that began in 1983, full-scale democracy in Argentina was reestablished. Argentina's democracy endured through the 2001\u201302 crisis and to the present day; it is regarded as more robust than both its pre-1983 predecessors and other democracies in Latin America.\nNational government.\nThe government structure of Argentina is a democracy; it contains the three branches of government.\nExecutive branch.\nThe current Chief of State and Head of Government is President Javier Milei.\nLegislative branch.\nLegislative Branch is a bicameral Congress, which consists of the Senate (72 seats), presided by the vice-president, and the Chamber of Deputies (257 seats), currently presided by Mart\u00edn Menem of the La Rioja Province. The General Auditing Office of the Nation and the Ombudsman are also part of this branch. Deputies serve for 4 years, while Senators serve for 6 years.\nJudiciary branch.\nThe Judiciary Branch is composed of federal judges and others with different jurisdictions, and a Supreme Court with five judges, appointed by the President with approval of the Senate, who may be deposed by Congress.\nProvincial and municipal governments.\nArgentina is divided into 23 Provinces, the equivalent of States, and one autonomous district, CABA, inside the Buenos Aires province. Because of Argentina's federal structure, every province has its own constitution, and authorities.\nEach province, except for Buenos Aires Province, is divided into departments (\"departamentos\"), or districts, which are in turn divided into municipalities. The Buenos Aires Province is different, its territory is divided into 134 districts called \"partidos,\" not municipalities.\nHistory.\nArgentina's first government, autonomous from the Spanish Crown, can be traced back to May 1810 and the May Revolution, where an assembly of Argentines, called Primera Junta, took power. Because at the time it was difficult to find the right form of government, and even more difficult to consolidate a Republic, Argentina experimented with different forms of assembly, like juntas and triumvirates. The 9th of July 1816, half of Argentina's provinces signed a declaration of independence. The beginnings of Argentine state building were rough and many provinces refused to answer to a central government and sign the first constitution of 1826. In 1853, after several years of centralist power, a new constitution was passed, this one consolidated, almost fully, the Argentine Nation. Buenos Aires, still refused to be considered part of the country. After the Battle of Pav\u00f3n in 1861, Buenos Aires set terms for its inclusion in the Constitution and the Republic of Argentina was born, with Bartolome Mitre as the President.\nArgentina is an example where institutional instability was established after an initial period of historical contingencies. Some random insignificant historical event favors one set of institutions at the beginning. Organizations became dependent on the framework of current institutions and made further investments to profit, making it undesirably costly to switch to other types of institutions. This means that the other potentially better alternative will be unable to catch up later. Consequently, increasing returns gradually locks the economy (or political institutions) to an outcome that is not necessarily superior. People altered their expectations and stopped investing in the system as the country experienced decades of regime changes after the 1930s, seeing both rules and rule-making processes being repeatedly overturned.\nWeakly enforced institutions are by design in some cases for domestic support. For example, anti-abortion was a punitive law in Argentina because many people recognize it as morally legitimate. The government put no resources into enforcing the rules, which allows the middle class to abort pregnancies in private clinics. On the other hand, strong enforcement might undermine the stability of regimes. Between 1930 and 1943, Argentine conservatives maintained power via fraud-ridden elections. After 1943, electoral rules were followed, leading to powerful actors repeatedly modifying the electoral institutions for their benefit.\nLiberal state.\nFrom 1852 until 1930 Argentina experienced liberal government with first oligarchic and then democratic tendencies. From 1852 to 1916 the government, run by the landowning elite, controlled the outcome of elections by committing fraud. This was contested by the rising middle-class and working-class sectors. This fueled the creation of more unions and political parties, including the Radical Civic Union (UCR), which represented the emergent middle-class. In 1912, Law 8871, or the S\u00e1enz Pe\u00f1a Law established universal, secret and obligatory male suffrage, which marked the middle classes entering the government, and displacing the landowning elite.\nWelfare state.\nSince the 1930s coups d'\u00e9tat have disrupted this democracy. After World War II and Juan Per\u00f3n's presidency, recurring economic and institutional crises fostered the rise of military regimes. In 1930, the elected president Hipolito Yrigoyen was ousted by a right-wing led coup. In 1931 the new government held controlled elections and blocked the participation of Yrigoyen's party. This alleged elections gave way to the \"Concordancia,\" a three-party regime. They controlled the Argentine government, through fraud and rigged elections, until 1943. Several factors, including the deaths of the most prominent leaders and World War II, led to another coup that ended the Concordancia regime. This coup was led by the army, which supported the Axis powers, and modeled the new government after Italy's fascist regime. Among the military leaders was Juan Per\u00f3n, who was in charge of the Secretariat of Labor and Social Welfare. He veered off the path set by the conservative army and set forth to improve the living and working conditions of workers, including giving Labor Unions support and governmental positions. He was jailed briefly, but after mass protests, he became president in the elections of 1946. His regime is known as a populist one, aided by the figure of his second wife, Eva Per\u00f3n, or \"Evita\". Their regime produced economic growth and improvements on living and working conditions. It also passed female suffrage (1947), and nationalized the central bank, electricity and gas, urban transport, railroads, and the telephone. After the death of his wife, Per\u00f3n started losing support. He was ousted in 1955 by another coup. Peronism lives on in Argentina. The next stage of the Social State was one characterized by both economic and political instability. Peron regained power in 1973, but died a year later. His third wife, Isabel, became president. She could not run the country and the military took power once again in 1976.\nNeoliberal state.\nJorge Rafael Videla's dictatorship began in 1976 but fell into decline in 1982 after a defeat in the Falklands War (, 1982), and ended in 1983 with the democratic election of President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn of the Radical Civic Union party (UCR). Alfons\u00edn faced significant challenges, including a military uprising, and resigned in 1989, six months before the end of his term, but the country was not in clear danger of becoming subject to a dictatorship again. Carlos Menem of the Justicialist Party (Peronist) served as president for ten years (1989-1999) and made a pact with Alfons\u00edn in order to achieve a 1994 constitutional reform that would allow him to be re-elected. Following a neoliberal program, he ruled until 1999, and then Fernando de la R\u00faa of the Alianza, led by the UCR, won election. This was the first time that a Peronist president properly finished his term and passed on his charge to another democratically elected president.\nDe la R\u00faa mismanaged the 1998\u20132002 Argentine great depression and resigned on December 21, 2001, amid violent riots. Several short-lived interim presidents came and went until Congress chose Eduardo Duhalde of the Justicialist Party (Peronist) to rule until some sort of social and economic peace could be restored. Duhalde took care of the most critical matters and called for democratic elections, which N\u00e9stor Kirchner of the Justicialist Party won (in the first use of the ballotage system). Kirchner took office on 25 May 2003. He did not run for re-election and, in December 2007, his wife Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner won the 2007 elections.\nAnarchist State.\nAfter gaining independence from Spain, Argentina faced tough questions about the direction to take their new nation state. Conservatives favored a pro agriculture society while liberals wanted to industrialize. Both parties only appealed to the small percentage of Argentine's with voting power. The vast majority of Argentine's could not vote in the 19th century because they did not own land, were not born in Argentina or were women. Thus the anarchist movement became popular amongst the non-elites and proposed reforms to the existing political structure.\nWomen in the Anarchist movement.\nWomen were among the largest group in the anarchist movement. Neither liberals or conservatives found much of a purpose for women in their society in roles other than homemakers. Soon women rejected this idea and proposed reforms that combined working class and feminist struggles into a movement. These women were critical of government because of Argentina's 1870 civil code.\nImmigrants in the Anarchist movement.\nIn the early stages of their nation Argentina offered wealthy Europeans land in their country to more emulate Europe. Their particular targets were Germans who were protestant. However the most common groups of people the came to Argentina seeking land were poorer catholic Europeans from Italy and Spain. These immigrants could not vote and were discriminated against because Argentina did not have a separation of church and state yet. They quickly became anarchists and spoke out against the church.\nElections and voting.\nElections.\nElections in Argentina have been regular since the reinstatement of democracy in 1983. Because it is a \"federal\" republic Argentina has national, provincial, municipal and Ciudad de Buenos Aires elections. For legislative positions elections are every two years, and for the executive power and governors every 4.\nApart from General elections and ballotage, Argentines also vote in PASO elections (primary, open, simultaneous, and obligatory elections). This is an instance before every type of election, to decide which candidates will participate in the general elections. Political parties must get at least 1,5% of valid votes to compete in general elections.\nThere are 16,508 elected public service positions. At the National level: the President and Vice President, 72 senators, and 257 deputies. In the Provincial level: 48 positions for Governor and Deputy Governor, 232 senators, 944 deputies, and 72 other elective positions in the provinces of Tierra del Fuego, C\u00f3rdoba, Mendoza, and La Pampa. Of the 23 provinces and CABA, 15 have unicameral legislatures, which do not have senatorial elections, and 9 have bicameral legislatures. In the Municipal level: 1.122 mayors and 8.488 city councils. Other authorities add up to 5.271 positions, such as the ones in municipal commissions in 10 provinces, and members of school commissions and accounts tribunals in 5 provinces.\nIn 2017, Argentina passed a bill that imposed gender parity in national elections in order to reach equal participation in Congress. The bill stipulates that all the lists of candidates for Congress must alternate between male and female candidates, and that half of the list of candidates for national positions have to be made up of women.\nVoting.\nIn Argentina, voting is obligatory for any Argentine, either native or naturalized, who is 18 years old. In November 2012, the government passed a new law that allowed Argentines between the ages of 16\u201318 to vote optionally.\nIn the 2015 national elections, voter turnout was particularly high: Chamber of Deputies 74.18%, Senate 79.83%, Presidential (1st Round) 78.66%, Presidential (2nd Round) 80.90%.\nPolitical parties.\nPolitical parties.\nArgentina's two largest political parties are the Justicialist Party (\"Partido Justicialista\", PJ), which evolved out of Juan Per\u00f3n's efforts in the 1940s to expand the role of labor in the political process (see Peronism), and the Radical Civic Union (\"Uni\u00f3n C\u00edvica Radical\", UCR), founded in 1891. Traditionally, the UCR had more urban middle-class support and the PJ more labor support, but as of 2011[ [update]] both parties are broadly based. Most of the numerous political parties that emerged in the past two decades have their origins or even the bulk of their identity tied to them.\nSmaller parties occupy various positions on the political spectrum and a number of them operate only in certain districts. In the years after Per\u00f3n's first years in office, several provincial parties emerged, often as a vehicle for the continued activities of Peronists, whose party was then banned, or as coalitions of politicians from all sectors wishing to take forward provincial interests. Provincial parties grew in popularity and number after the return of democracy in 1983, and took several of the provincial governor positions. Both these parties and the provincial branches of the UCR and PJ have frequently been dominated by modern \"caudillos\" and family dynasties, such as the Sapags of Neuqu\u00e9n and the Rodr\u00edguez Sa\u00e1's of San Luis. This has in turn been a factor in the ongoing factionalism within the two principal parties at national and local levels.\nHistorically, the organized labor (largely tied to the Justicialist Party) and the armed forces have also played significant roles in national life. Labor's political power was significantly weakened by free market reforms during the 1990s, as well as the cooptation of its leaders by the Menem administration. They now seem to be returning to their former position, since the current government focuses on a productive model with local industry as one of the top priorities.\nThe armed forces are firmly under civilian control. Repudiated by the public after a period of military rule marked by human rights violations, economic decline, and military defeat, the Argentine military today is a downsized, volunteer force focused largely on international peacekeeping. While Menem and de la R\u00faa simply reduced their funding, Kirchner has effected an \"ideological cleansing\", removing a large portion of the top ranks and replacing them with younger leaders with an explicit commitment to preserve human rights and submit to the decisions of the civilian government.\nA grouping of left-leaning parties and dissident Peronists \u2013the Front for a Country in Solidarity (\"Frente por un Pa\u00eds Solidario\", FREPASO)\u2013 emerged in the 1990s as a serious third party, coming second in the 1995 Presidential elections. In August 1997 the UCR and FREPASO joined in a coalition called Alliance for Work, Justice and Education (informally Alianza, \"Alliance\"). The Alliance succeeded in taking Fernando de la R\u00faa (UCR) to the presidency in 1999, with Carlos \"Chacho\" \u00c1lvarez (FrePaSo) as vice president. Shortly after, in October 2000 \u00c1lvarez resigned after a scandal related to presidential bribes in the Senate (the President's party refused to support or investigate the accusations), so the Alliance (and even the FrePaSo) effectively broke down. Moreover, in the midst of serious economic crisis and riots, President Fernando de la R\u00faa resigned on December 21, 2001, leaving the UCR reputation severely damaged. The centennial party lost many of its supporters and a bunch of smaller parties emerged from its ashes.\nTwo of them scored well in the 2003 presidential election: Support for an Egalitarian Republic (ARI), formed on the initiative of Deputy Elisa Carri\u00f3, presented itself as a non-compromising front against corruption and for progressive ideas. ARI somewhat took the center left positions of the defunct Alliance in the ideological spectrum. In those elections, Carri\u00f3 came a close fourth in. Her influence diminished afterward, as the N\u00e9stor Kirchner administration -running on center left policies- succeeded, and she took a more conservative stance, eventually dividing her party and founding a new alliance, the Civic Coalition. In June 2007, Fabiana R\u00edos, a National Deputy enrolled in ARI, was elected Governor of the Province of Tierra del Fuego, becoming the first governor belonging to this party.\nThe other splinter UCR party, called Recrear, was led by former De la R\u00faa Minister of Economy Ricardo L\u00f3pez Murphy. Recrear captured the urban moderate right-wing spectrum of voters. L\u00f3pez Murphy came third in the 2003 presidential elections, with a platform that emphasized transparency, polarizing with former President Carlos Menem. After meagre results for his 2005 senatorial candidacy, and ahead of the 2007 elections, he joined a group of Province-based parties and Macri's Commitment to Change in a new centre-right coalition dubbed Republican Proposal (\"Propuesta Republicana\", PRO). On that ticket, Macri was elected Chief of government of Buenos Aires Autonomous City.\nSince the 2008 agricultural sector strikes, political support for President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and her husband, ex-president N\u00e9stor Kirchner, diminished considerably. The tax on agricultural exports divided the National Congress as much as the public opinion. On 27 July 2008, the tax reform was put down by a votation at the Senate, which came to be decided by the vote of Vice President Julio Cobos, effectively breaking the governmental coalition Plural Consensus. Since then, a fraction of dissident peronists allied with conservative PRO, Julio Cobos -through Federal Consensus (ConFe)- started negotiations with his former party, UCR. The Radical Civic Union, in turn, formalized an alliance with the Socialist Party and Elisa Carri\u00f3's Civic Coalition, styled the Civic and Social Agreement (\"Acuerdo C\u00edvico y Social\", ACyS).\nFor the 2009 legislative elections, former President Kirchner ran himself as a candidate to National Deputy on top of the Front for Victory (\"Frente para la Victoria\", FPV) party in the Province of Buenos Aires. After the defeat of FPV in the 2015 presidential elections, Cristina Kirchen decided to form another party called Citizen's Unity. She ran as senator of Santa Cruz with this party and won.\nLatest presidential elections.\nSummary of the 2023 Argentine general election\nPolicy.\nPolicy in Argentina after the several military dictatorships has been varied and has aimed at stabilizing the country. As stated above, Argentina's politics do not lead to a particular side, but instead take the country in many directions. Since the last military junta gave up its power in 1983, each administration that has been in power has had different priorities. President Alfons\u00edn took office in 1983 and his main task was to ensure a peaceful transition. In the end he was overcome by an economic crisis that led to a bout of hyperinflation.\nAfter Alfonsin, came President Menem who had to control inflation and stabilize the economy. He did so by adopting a series of radical measures including fixed parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar. He then engaged in a program to move Argentina's economy towards a liberal model. This plan included the privatization of the previously state-owned telecommunications company, oil conglomerate (YPF), airline (Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas), railroads and utilities. As a result, large foreign direct investment flowed into Argentina for a short time, improving in some isolated cases the infrastructure and quality of service of those companies. His policies culminated in the highest unemployment rates of Argentine history and the doubling of external debt.\nIn the social arena, Menem pardoned military officers serving sentences for human rights abuses of the Dirty War. To balance the unpopular decision, he also pardoned some of the insurgents convicted of guerrilla attacks in the 1970s. The public scandal after the assassination of the soldier Omar Carrasco forced Menem to end compulsory military conscription.\nFernando de la R\u00faa's term was notoriously ineffective on many accounts. Elected with a popular mandate to reinvigorate the economy and crack down on the corruption of the Menem administration, de la R\u00faa was unable or unwilling to perform these tasks. He continued on the same economic course of Menem, which ultimately led to the 2001 economic crash and de la R\u00faa's resignation. The FrePaSo ministers of the administration, elected on a wave of hope for social changes, also disappointed with a perceived lack of investment in social schemes.\nEduardo Duhalde's interim term was strongly limited by a highly mobilized society. It was marked by the need to pacify the country and soften the impact of the crisis after the forced devaluation of the local currency, the peso, which had lost three quarters of its value in a matter of months. Duhalde employed a mixture of traditional Peronist politics (in the form of a monetary subsidy for heads of families) and neo-Keynesian economic principles to stabilize the economy and bring peace to the streets.\nN\u00e9stor Kirchner, who belonged to the moderate center-left wing of Peronism (rooted in the leftist Peronist factions of the 1970s), continued Duhalde's measures (even keeping his Minister of Economy, Roberto Lavagna) and added some heterodox economics. Heavy taxes on exports have served to keep local prices of valuable commodities in check, while collecting huge revenues (especially from oil products and agricultural exports like soybeans). The restrictive monetary policy of the 1990s has become aggressively expansive; the Central Bank has injected large amounts of cash into the economy and bought dollars from the free currency market in order to accumulate reserves. The fiscal policy is also expansive; the government has raised private and public salaries by decree on several occasions, and has encouraged negotiations between the private sector and the labor movements. Inflation has again become a concern. The government has struck price-freezing agreements with certain sectors of the economy (producers of milk, some foods, natural gas, etc.) and put heavy pressure on others. Failure to comply on the part of Argentine beef producers has been met with a punitive suspension of exports, starting March 2006, intended to increase domestic supply (this was then softened to a quota system).\nCristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner came after her husband with even more liberal policies. She strictly imposed import regulations to encourage local production and exports. She started talks with financial officials to pay off Argentina's debt and promised foreign investment. In 2012, the move to nationalize YPF, an oil firm, scared off the foreign investors. She launched a conditional cash transfer program as well, called Asignaci\u00f3n Universal por Hijo (AUH), which provided financial incentives to low-income or poor citizens for them to send their children to school and get vaccinated. During her presidency, same-sex marriage was legalized, and a new law was passed that allowed name and sex change in official documents for transgender people, even if they had not undergone sex reassignment surgery.\nMauricio Macri was elected in 2015 and he came in as a more conservative politician. Besides this, he did not implement any conservative policy. He only cut subsidies to the energy, but did not cut taxes, did not cut federal spending, did not reduce the national deficit and did not try to free the market. Because of his inability to take in serious reforms, he ordered a 50 billion dollar bailout to the IMF in order to restore the economy, which is currently in an economic crisis.\nOn 10 December 2019, the Centre-Left Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez of the Justicialist Party was inaugurated President, after defeating the incumbent Mauricio Macri in the 2019 Argentine general election.\nOn 14 November 2021, the center-left coalition of Argentina's ruling Peronist party, Frente de Todos (Front for Everyone), lost its majority in Congress, for the first time in almost 40 years, in midterm legislative elections. The election victory of the center-right coalition, Juntos por el Cambio (Together for Change), meant a tough final two years in office for President Alberto Fernandez. Losing control of the Senate made it difficult for him to make key appointments, including to the judiciary. It also forced him to negotiate with the opposition every initiative he sends to the legislature.\nIn April 2023, President Alberto Fernandez announced that he will not seek re-election in the next presidential election. The 19 November 2023 election run-off vote ended in a win for far-right outsider Javier Milei with close to 56% of the vote against 44% of the ruling coalition candidate Sergio Massa. On 10 December 2023, Javier Milei was sworn in as new president of Argentina. At the time of Milei's inauguration, Argentina's economy was suffering 143 percent annual inflation, the currency had plunged and four out of 10 Argentines were in poverty. In October 2025, President Javier Milei's party, La Libertad Avanza, won a landslide victory in midterm elections, making it easier for Milei to push ahead with his programme of radical spending cuts and free-market reforms.\nAbortion.\nIn March 2018, a draft for an abortion law was debated in Parliament. The law allowed legal abortion until the 14th week of pregnancy if pregnant women were in danger of physical, psychological or social danger as well as pregnancy caused by rape or invalid fetuses. On 14 June, Parliament accepted the law with a slim majority of 129\u2013123. The debates surrounding the bill caused demonstrations of supporters and opponents. The question of abortion is still contentious in society due to the strong influence of the Catholic Church.\nPolitical pressure groups.\nSome of the most important political-pressure groups in Argentina include: the Argentine Association of Pharmaceutical Labs (CILFA); the Argentine Industrial Union (manufacturers' association); Sociedad Rural Argentina and CARBAP (landowners' associations); the General Confederation of Labor or CGT (Peronist-leaning umbrella labor organization); the Roman Catholic Church; students.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67623", "revid": "2304267", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67623", "title": "Transport in Argentina", "text": " \nTransport in Argentina is mainly based on a complex network of routes, crossed by relatively inexpensive long-distance buses and by cargo trucks. The country also has a number of national and international airports. The importance of the long-distance train is minor today, though in the past it was widely used and is now regaining momentum after the re-nationalisation of the country's commuter and freight networks. Fluvial transport is mostly used for cargo.\nWithin the urban areas, the main transportation system is by the bus or \"colectivo\"; bus lines transport millions of people every day in the larger cities and their metropolitan areas as well as a bus rapid transport system known as Metrobus. Buenos Aires additionally has an underground, the only one in the country, and Greater Buenos Aires is serviced by a system of suburban trains.\nPublic transportation.\nA majority of people use public transport rather than personal cars to move around in the cities, especially in common business hours, since parking can be both difficult and expensive. Cycling is becoming increasingly common in big cities as a result of a growing network of cycling lanes in cities like Buenos Aires and Rosario.\nBus.\nThe \"Colectivo\" (urban bus) cover the cities with numerous lines. Fares might be fixed for the whole city, or they might depend on the destination. \"Colectivos\" often cross municipal borders into the corresponding metropolitan areas. In some cases there are \"diferenciales\" (special services) which are faster, and notably more expensive. Bus lines in a given city might be run by different private companies and/or by the municipal state, and they might be painted in different colours for easier identification. The city of Buenos Aires has in recent years been expanding its Metrobus BRT system to complement its existing Underground network and it is estimated that, along with other measures, it will increase the city's use of public transport by 30 percent.\nTaxi.\nTaxis are very common and relatively accessible price-wise. They have different colours and fares in different cities, though a highly contrasted black-and-yellow design is common to the largest conurbations. Call-taxi companies (\"radio-taxis\") are very common, while the \"remisse\" is another form of hired transport: they are very much like call-taxis, but do not share a common design, and trip fares are agreed beforehand instead of using the meter. Although, there are often fixed prices for common destinations.\nCommuter rail.\nSuburban trains connect Buenos Aires city with the Greater Buenos Aires area, \"(see: Buenos Aires commuter rail network)\". Every weekday, more than 1.4 million people commute to the Argentine capital for work and other business. These suburban trains work between 4 AM and 1 AM. The busiest lines are electric, several are diesel powered, while some of these are currently being electrified, while the rolling stock is being replaced across the city. Until recently, Trenes de Buenos Aires, UGOFE, Ferrov\u00edas and Metrov\u00edas were some of the private companies which provided suburban passenger services in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. However, with the modernisation and re-nationalisation of these services, many of these companies have had their contracts terminated or have been absorbed into Trenes Argentinos (the state railway operator), though as of 2015 some private operators such as Metrov\u00edas (Urquiza Line) do remain.\nOther cities in Argentina with a system of suburban trains include Resistencia, Paran\u00e1 and Mendoza, which is home to the Metrotranv\u00eda Mendoza - an urban light rail network. A commuter rail network for C\u00f3rdoba is planned to complement the existing Tren de las Sierras which currently runs through the city and to nearby towns and villages.\nUnderground Subway.\nAs of 2015, Buenos Aires is the only Argentine city with an underground metro system, nonetheless there is a project to build a system in the city of C\u00f3rdoba (C\u00f3rdoba Metro) making it the second underground system in Argentina. The Buenos Aires Underground (Subterr\u00e1neo de Buenos Aires) has currently six lines, each labelled with a letter from A to H, though 3 more lines are planned. A modern tram line (PreMetro) line E2 works as a feeder to Underground Line E at their outer terminus as well as the Urquiza Line for Underground Line B in Chacarita. Daily ridership is 1.3 million and on the increase. Most of the lines of the Buenos Aires Undergrounds connect the city centre (Micro-centro) with areas in the outskirts of the city proper, though none go outside the city limits to Greater Buenos Aires.\nIn recent years, the Underground has seen a gradual expansion, with lines H, B and A seeing extensions. As of 2015, the extension of lines E and H are under construction, with work commenced on the new line F and two additional lines (G and I) planned. Similarly, the rolling stock has been gradually replaced in recent years and there are further plans to modernise.\nTram.\nTrams (streetcars), once common, were retired as a form of public transport in the 1960s but are now in the stages of a slow comeback.\nIn 1987 a modern tram line was opened as a feeder for the underground system. A modern light rail line between the Bartolom\u00e9 Mitre suburban railway station and Tigre (\"Tren de la Costa\") inaugurated in 1996 operates in the northern suburbs. A 2-kilometre tram known as the Tranv\u00eda del Este (Eastern Tram) was inaugurated 2007 in the Puerto Madero district of Buenos Aires using loaned French Alstom Citadis trams, but plans for its extension never came to fruition, and declining patronage led the line's closure in 2012.\nTrams were once extremely common in Buenos Aires, with the city having a large 875\u00a0km tramway network and the largest tramway-to-population ratio the world, which gained it notoriety as \"the city of trams\" across the world. The first trams began operating in the 1860s, however by the 1960s the network was dismantled and replaced by buses. There is a Heritage Tramway maintained by enthusiasts that operates a large collection of vintage trams on weekends, near the Primera Junta Underground Line A station in the Caballito neighbourhood.\nThe city of Mendoza also has its own tram system called the Metrotranv\u00eda Mendoza which has 16 stations and connects the city with its conurbation. Other Argentine cities with tram systems are Paran\u00e1 and La Plata, both using the nationally built TecnoTren railbuses. The city of Santiago del Estero is constructing an elevated light rail system to connect itself with its metropolitan area. Trolleybuses are operated in C\u00f3rdoba, Mendoza and Rosario.\nRoad transport.\nSince Argentina is almost 4,000 kilometres long and more than 1,000\u00a0km wide, long distance transportation is of great importance. Several toll expressways spread out from Buenos Aires, serving nearly half the nation's population. The majority of Argentine roads, however, are two-lane national and provincial routes and, though they are spread throughout the country, less than a third of Argentina's 230,000\u00a0km (145,000\u00a0mi) of roads are currently paved.\nThough, by 1929, Argentina was already home to over 400,000 vehicles, virtually all long-distance travel was done on the nation's vast railways. Argentina, then, lacked a road-building program until 1932, when the National Highway Directorate was established. Paid for at first with an excise tax on gasoline, the bureau could claim some important accomplishments, like the 1951 opening of the 200\u00a0km Santa Fe-Rosario expressway.\nArgentina is home to around 9.2 million registered cars, trucks and buses; on a per capita basis, it has long had Latin America's widest accessibility to motor vehicles. Left-lane drivers until 1945, Argentine motorists have since been driving on the right-hand side. The Vehicle registration plates of Argentina are based on a three letters-three numbers per car (with the exception of some trucks) system.\nExpressways have been recently doubled in length (to nearly) and now link most (though not all) important cities. The most important of these is probably the Panamerican National Route 9 Buenos Aires \u2013 Rosario \u2013 C\u00f3rdoba freeway. The longest continuous highways are National Route 40, a 5000-km stretch along the Andes range and the 3000-km sea-side trunk road National Route 3, running from Buenos Aires to Ushuaia.\nLong distance buses.\nArgentine long distance buses are fast, affordable and comfortable; they have become the primary means of long-distance travel since railway privatisations in the early 1990s greatly downsized Argentina's passenger rail service and plane tickets are more expensive. Competing providers differ little on their time-honoured formula, offering three different services regarding the number of stops and type of seats: the \"Regular\", \"Semi-cama\" (semi-bed), and \"Cama\" (bed), with \"Cama\" being similar to an airline's business class but the names vary. They may also be called \"Ejecutivo\", \"Cama-vip\", \"Cama-suite\" and some other names. Some services, usually the ones that are more expensive, have also on-board dining, while others stop at restaurants by the road. Long and middle-distance buses cover almost all paved-accessible cities, towns and villages.\nRail transport.\nLong-distance passenger services.\nServices on Argentina's passenger railway system, once extensive and prosperous, were greatly reduced in 1993 following the break-up of Ferrocarriles Argentinos (FA), the state railway corporation. Despite the decline of the railway under privatisation, Argentina still maintains the 8th largest rail network in the world, with 36,966\u00a0km of track.\nFollowing the break-up, however, several private and provincial railway companies had been created and resurrected some of the major passenger trains that FA once operated, albeit with far more limited services than under state administration. Trenes de Buenos Aires, Ferrocentral, Ferrobaires, and Tren Patag\u00f3nico were some of the private companies that managed Argentina's long distance passenger rail network in this period.\nMore recently, the government has begun nationalising some of these private companies or simply not renewing their contracts, while at the same time, the state-owned Trenes Argentinos began re-opening services and improving on the once private services using completely new rolling stock, including services from Buenos Aires to Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires-Rosario-Cordoba. In many cases, the Argentine Government has completely replaced, or is in the process of replacing, the existing infrastructure with continuous welded rails on concrete sleepers.\nThe national government's official stance on rail transport is to re-open all lines that ceased operation following the privatisation in the 1990s. In April 2015, by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law which re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos as Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos, effectively re-nationalising the country's railways, a move which saw support from all political parties on both sides of the political spectrum.\nHigh-speed rail.\nA high-speed rail line between Buenos Aires, Rosario and C\u00f3rdoba with speeds up to 320\u00a0km/h is in the design stages. Construction was supposed to begin by early 2009 for the first segment to Rosario.\nIn 2007 bids were called for a turnkey contract for a second high speed line, linking Buenos Aires and Mendoza.\nIn February 2008 national government announced another call for bid, this time for construction of a high speed train linking Buenos Aires and Mar del Plata; The Mar del Plata TAVe. As of 2015, the project remains suspended.\nFreight service.\nOver 25 million tonnes of freight were transported by rail in 2007. Currently, five carriers operate freight rail services in Argentina:\nThe government began refurbishing and investing heavily in the country's freight network from 2014, beginning with the re-nationalisation of the Belgrano Cargas freight operator. Further investment of US$2.5 billion has been agreed with China in an effort to improve freight capacity throughout Argentina and refurbish ageing track segments. Through this investment, the government ordered 1000 freight wagons from Argentine state-owned company Fabricaciones Militares, while the deal with China included the purchase of 100 locomotives and 3,500 carriages from the country. This investment was doubled to US$4.8 billion in September 2015.\nA map of the existing freight network in Argentina (as of 2014) can be found here https://.\nTourist railways.\nA number of steam powered heritage railways (tourist trains) are in operation; the Old Patagonian Express (locally known as \"La Trochita\") in Patagonia, the Train of the End of the World (Southern Fuegian Railway) in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego and a short run Tren Hist\u00f3rico de Bariloche.\nA diesel-electric Tren a las Nubes in the province of Salta runs from the city of Salta to San Antonio de los Cobres. The national government had closed the line after nationalising it in order to restore the tracks, however it returned to service in March, 2015 with refurbished rolling stock and rails under the operation of Trenes Argentinos.\nThe Tren de las Sierras, as well as linking together parts of the centre of the city of C\u00f3rdoba, also functions as a tourist railway along the Sierras de C\u00f3rdoba foothills.\nInternational rail links to adjacent countries.\nNew International link proposed.\nA modern railway connection in order to replace the now-defunct Transandine Railway between Argentina and Chile has been proposed and is currently in the planning stages with support from an international consortium of companies. The rail link will carry both passengers and freight through the Andes, linking the cities of Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile. The link would also service Argentina's vast oil fields.\nAir travel.\nThough traditionally more expensive when compared with the other means of transportation, air travel is becoming increasingly common due to more competitive prices. Every provincial capital has its own airport, and there are many others, particularly in tourist areas such as Bariloche and El Calafate (see list of airports in Argentina). Most companies have several daily flights to the most popular destinations, and daily or less frequent flights to other destinations. Since 2003, the Ministry of The Interior and Transport has overseen numerous construction works throughout the country's airports, ranging from the building of new terminals to extending the lengths of runways and improving radar systems.\nThe national flag carrier is \"Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas\", which was re-nationalised from Iberia in 2008 with the government citing mismanagement under the Spanish firm. Under government ownership, the airline has renewed much of its fleet and tripled its size, with passenger numbers increasing significantly. Along with other international carriers, the airline handles most of its international flights from Ministro Pistarini International Airport.\nEven though Buenos Aires is the most important flight hub, for both economical and geographical reasons, there are flights between important cities, such as C\u00f3rdoba, Rosario and Mendoza.\nArgentina had a total of 1,138 airports (including airstrips) in the country in 2013, the 6th highest in the world.\nFluvial transport.\nFluvial transport is not often used for people, with the exception of those who cross the R\u00edo de la Plata from Buenos Aires to Colonia del Sacramento and Montevideo, both in Uruguay. Other services are exclusively used as river crossing, such as those in Tigre.\nRiver traffic is mostly made up of cargo, especially on the Paran\u00e1 River, which is navigable by very large ships (Panamax kind) downstream from the Greater Rosario area. This area produces and/or ships most of the agricultural exports of Argentina.\n \"country comparison to the world: \" 21\n \"country comparison to the world: \" 6\n \"country comparison to the world: \" 11\n \"country comparison to the world: \" 6\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most of Australia's population live close to coastlines.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Largest_cities/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nTotal fertility rate.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nThe total fertility rate is the number of children born per woman. It is based on fairly good data for the entire period. Sources: Our World In Data and Gapminder Foundation.\nThe following figures show the total fertility rates since the first years of British colonisation.\nVital statistics.\nSource:\nNotable events in Australian demographics:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife expectancy.\nAt the time of Australian Federation in 1901, the rate of natural increase was 14.9 persons per 1,000 population. The rate increased to a peak of 17.4 per thousand population in the years 1912, 1913 and 1914. During the Great Depression, the rate declined to a low of 7.1 per thousand population in 1934 and 1935. Immediately after World War II, the rate increased sharply as a result of the start of the post\u2013World War II baby boom and the immigration of many young people who then had children in Australia. A rate plateau of over 13.0 persons per 1,000 population occurred for every year from 1946 to 1962.\nThere has been a fall in the rate of natural increase since 1962 due to falling fertility. In 1971, the rate of natural increase was 12.7 persons per 1,000 population; a decade later it had fallen to 8.5. In 1996 the rate of natural increase fell below seven for the first time, with the downward trend continuing in the late 1990s. Population projections by the Australian Bureau of Statistics indicate that continued low fertility, combined with the increase in deaths from an ageing population, will result in natural increase falling below zero sometime in the mid-2030s. However, in 2006 the fertility rate rose to 1.81, one of the highest rates in the OECD.\nSince 1901, the crude death rate has fallen from about 12.2 deaths per 1,000 population, to 6.4 deaths per 1,000 population in 2006.\nSource: \"Our World in Data\"\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nIndigenous population.\nThe earliest accepted timeline for the first arrivals of indigenous Australians to the continent of Australia places this human migration to at least 40,000 years ago.\nDutch navigators landed on the coasts of modern Western Australia and Queensland several times during the 17th century. Captain James Cook wrote that he claimed the east coast for Great Britain in 1770 while standing on Possession Island off the west coast of Cape York Peninsula. The west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have numbered between as few as 315,000 and as many as 1,100,000, divided into many tribes speaking many different languages. In the 2011 census, 495,757 respondents declared they were Aboriginal, 31,407 declared they were Torres Strait Islander, and a further 21,206 declared they were both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.\nToday, most of Australia's Indigenous population live on the east coast of Australia, where almost 60% of Indigenous Australians live in New South Wales (208,476) and Queensland (188,954) which roughly represents 2\u20135% of those state's populations. The Northern Territory has an Indigenous population of 61,115, which represents 26.3% of the total Northern Territory population.\nThere were 24,737 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander births registered in 2023, an increase of 349 babies from 2022. This represents 8.6% of all births registered in 2023. The total fertility rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women was 2.17 births per woman.\nOf the 24,388 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander births registered in 2022 only 23% were births for which both parents were identified as being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin on the birth certificate. 45% were births where only the mother was of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin (including births where paternity was not acknowledged or the father's Indigenous status was not stated), and 32% were births where only the father was of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander origin (including births where the mother's Indigenous status was not stated).\nAncestry.\nThe earliest accepted timeline for the first arrivals of humans to the continent of Australia places this human migration to at least 65,000 years ago, most probably from the islands of Indonesia and New Guinea.\nCaptain James Cook claimed the east coast for Great Britain in 1770; the west coast was later settled by Britain also. At that time, the indigenous population was estimated to have been between 315,000 and 750,000, divided into as many as 500 tribes speaking many different languages.\nBetween 1788 and the Second World War, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from the British Isles (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following the Second World War, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism, and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century.\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics no longer collects data on race, but does ask each Australian resident to nominate up to two ancestries each census. These ancestry responses are classified into broad standardised ancestry groups. In the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated individual ancestries as a proportion of the total population were: \nAt the 2021 census, 3.2% of the Australian population identified as being Indigenous \u2014 Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders. In 2020, 7.5% of births were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons up from 5.7% in 2010; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander fertility rates have stayed above replacement levels even as the nation's has declined rapidly.\nAlthough the ABS does not collect data on race and ethnic background, various studies have put together results of the census to determine the ethnic composition of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission has estimated the European population at 76% of the Australian population in 2016, while a media diversity study put it at 72% in 2021, the non-European proportion was 21% and 23% respectively, and the Aboriginal Australian population at 3% in both.\nImmigration minister Andrew Giles had pledged to incorporate a question on ethnicity into the 2026 Australian census. However in 2024 the ABS decided against collecting data on ethnicity in favor of ancestry. As recent studies indicate that the public does not have a consistent understanding of ethnic identity, or the difference between ethnic identity and ancestry. The ABS determined that due to these complexities, collecting both ethnic identity and ancestry on the same form is not feasible for the 2026 Census.\nImmigration and country of birth.\nIn 2019, 30% of the Australian resident population, or 7,529,570 people, were born overseas.\nAustralia's population has quadrupled since the end of World War I, much of this increase from immigration. Australia has the world's eighth-largest immigrant population, with immigrants accounting for 30% of the population, a higher proportion than in any other nation with a population of over 10 million. Asia is the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century. Net overseas migration reached a record level of 536,000 in 2022\u201323. Overall migration was 739,000 in 2022-23. Net permanent and long-term arrivals in 2023 were 447,790, the highest on record. Most immigrants are skilled, but the immigration quota includes categories for family members and refugees.\nThe following table shows Australia's population by country of birth as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2023. It shows only countries or regions or birth with a population of over 100,000 residing in Australia.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nAs of 2020, 29.8% of Australia's population was born overseas and 76% as of 2016 had European ancestry. The percentage of Australians with European backgrounds has been declining since the 1960s and 1970s, which is around the time the White Australia policy was abolished.\nLanguage.\nThe vast majority of Australians speak English at home, with the exception of some Aboriginal Australians and first-generation immigrants.\nAlthough Australia has no official language, English has always been the \"de facto\" national language and the only common tongue. Australian English is a major variety of the language, with a distinctive accent and lexicon, and differs slightly from other varieties of English in grammar and spelling. General Australian serves as the standard variety.\nAt the 2021 census English was the only language spoken in the homes of 72% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Mandarin Chinese (2.7%), Arabic (1.4%), Vietnamese (1.3%), and Cantonese (1.2%). Considerable proportions of first- and second-generation immigrants are bilingual.\nOver 250 Indigenous Australian languages are thought to have existed at the time of first European contact; fewer than 20 are still in daily use by all age groups. About 110 others are spoken exclusively by older people. At the time of the 2006 census, 52,000 Indigenous Australians, representing 12% of the Indigenous population, reported that they spoke an Indigenous language at home.\nAustralia has its own sign language, Auslan. The Australian Bureau of Statistics included Auslan as an option for the first time in the 2021 census when asking which language was used at home. According to the census, it is the main language of about 16,000 deaf people.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAt the 2021 Census, 38.9% of the population identified as having \"no religion\", up from 15.5% in 2001. The largest religion is Christianity (43.9% of the population). The largest Christian denominations are the Roman Catholic Church (20% of the population) and the Anglican Church of Australia (9.8%). Multicultural immigration since the Second World War has led to the growth of non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%), Hinduism (2.7%), Buddhism (2.4%), Sikhism (0.8%), and Judaism (0.4%).\nThe Australian Bureau of Statistics 2001 Census Dictionary statement on religious affiliation states the purpose for gathering such information:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Data on religious affiliation are used for such purposes as planning educational facilities, aged persons' care and other social services provided by religion-based organisations; the location of church buildings; the assigning of chaplains to hospitals, prisons, armed services and universities; the allocation of time on public radio and other media; and sociological research.\nHistorically, Australian Aboriginal religion and mythology was the prevalent belief system in Australia until around 1840, when European Australians first outnumbered indigenous Australians. For a period, in the 19th and 20th centuries, Australia was majority Protestant with a large Catholic minority. Catholics first outnumbered Anglicans in the 1986 census. As a result of this history, while Australia has no official religion and \"no religion\" constitutes the largest group by religious identification, the various governments of Australia refer to the Christian God in their ceremonies, as do the various Australian Courts. In all censuses since 1991, the percentage of Christians has been steadily decreasing, while the percentage of non-religious has been increasing.\nAs in many Western countries, the level of active participation in religious services is lower than would be indicated by the proportion of the population identifying themselves as affiliated with a religion; weekly attendance at Christian church services is about 1.5 million, or about 7.5% of the population. Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools play a prominent role in welfare and education services. The is the second biggest sector after government schools, with more than 795,000 students (and around 20 per cent of all secondary school enrolments).\nEconomics.\nIn trend terms, in April 2025, the Australian labour force consisted of 14,622,100 people, representing a seasonal employment rate of 64.4%; on the same time, unemployment and underemployment rates remained at 4.1% and 6.0% respectively. At the 2021 census, the national median weekly personal income across Australia was $789, and the median weekly household income was $1,770. More than half of people had employee wages and salary as their main source of income (56.4% or more than 10.5 million people). Government benefits and allowances were the main source of income for 23.4% or 4.4 million people.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67633", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67633", "title": "Transport in Australia", "text": "There are many forms of transport in Australia. Australia is highly dependent on road transport due to its large size. There are more than 300 airports with paved runways. Passenger rail transport includes widespread commuter networks in the major capital cities with more limited intercity and interstate networks. The Australian mining sector is reliant upon rail to transport its product to Australia's ports for export.\nRoad transport.\nRoad transport is an essential element of the Australian transport network, and an enabler of the Australian economy. There is a heavy reliance on road transport due to Australia's large area and low population density in considerable parts of the country. This is similar to the US. Australia's road network experiences excessive demand during peak periods and very weak demand overnight.\nAnother reason for the reliance upon roads is that the Australian rail network has not been sufficiently developed for a lot of the freight and passenger requirements in most areas of Australia. This has meant that goods that would otherwise be transported by rail are moved across Australia via road trains. Almost every household owns at least one car, and uses it most days.\nThere are three different categories of Australian roads. They are federal highways, state highways and local roads. The road network comprises a total of 913,000\u00a0km broken down into:\nVictoria has the largest network, with thousands of arterial (major, primary and secondary) roads to add.\nThe majority of road tunnels in Australia have been constructed since the 1990s to relieve traffic congestion in metropolitan areas, or to cross significant watercourses.\nCars.\nAustralia has the thirteenth-highest level of car ownership in the world. It has three to four times more road per capita than Europe and seven to nine times more than Asia. Australia also has the third-highest per capita rate of fuel consumption in the world. Melbourne is the most car-dependent city in Australia, according to a data survey in the 2010s, having over 110,000 more cars driving to and from the city each day than Sydney. Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane are rated as being close behind. All these capital cities are rated among the highest in this category in the world (car dependency). The distance travelled by car (or similar vehicle) in Australia is among the highest in the world.\nElectric vehicles.\nThe adoption of plug-in electric vehicles in Australia is driven mostly by state-based electric vehicle targets and monetary incentives to support the adoption and deployment of low- or zero-emission vehicles. The monetary incentives include electric vehicle subsidies, interest-free loans, registration exemptions, stamp duty exemptions, the luxury car tax exemption and discounted parking for both private and commercial purchases. The Victorian and New South Wales governments target between 50% and 53% of new car sales to be electric vehicles by 2030.\nPublic transport in Australia.\nSuburban rail.\nSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide have extensive suburban rail networks which have grown and expanded over time. Australian suburban rail typically operates with bidirectional all-day services with Sydney, Melbourne, and to a lesser extent Perth and Brisbane's systems operating with much higher frequencies, particularly in their underground cores. Sydney Trains operates the busiest system in the country with approximately 1 million trips per day. Metro Trains Melbourne operates a larger system albeit with a lower number of trips.\nTrams and light rail.\nTrams have historically operated in many Australian towns and cities, with the majority of these being shut down before the 1970s in the belief that more widespread car ownership would render them unnecessary. Melbourne is a major exception and today has the largest tram network of any city in the world. Adelaide retained one tram service \u2014 the Glenelg tram line, since 2008 extended to Hindmarsh and the East End. Trams once operated in Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and Hobart, and a number of major regional cities including Ballarat, Bendigo, Broken Hill, Fremantle, Geelong, Kalgoorlie, Launceston, Maitland, Newcastle, Rockhampton, and Sorrento.\nThe Inner West Light Rail opened in Sydney in 1997 with the conversion of a disused section of the Metropolitan Goods line. The CBD and South East Light Rail opened to Randwick in December 2019 and Kingsford in April 2020. A light rail system opened in 2014. A line opened in Newcastle in February 2019 and one in Canberra opened in April 2019.\nRapid transit.\nSydney is the only city in Australia with a rapid transit system. The Sydney Metro currently consists of one 52\u00a0km driverless line, connecting Tallawong and Sydenham, and is scheduled to be extended to Bankstown in 2025 under the Metro North West &amp; Bankstown Line. Upon completion, it will complete the Sydney Metro City &amp; Southwest project to form a 66\u00a0km network with 31 metro stations.\nThe Sydney Metro West and Sydney Metro Western Sydney Airport are currently under construction. The former aims to connect Westmead to the Sydney CBD, via stations including Parramatta, Sydney Olympic Park, Five Dock, and the Bays Precinct, and is scheduled to be completed by 2032. The latter aims to connect St Marys and Badgerys Creek Aerotropolis via Western Sydney Airport, scheduled to be completed in 2026, aligning with the opening of the airport.\nSydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth's commuter systems are all partially underground and reflect some aspects of typical rapid transit systems, particularly in the city centres.\nIntra-city public transport networks.\nThe following table presents an overview of multi-modal intra-city public transport networks in Australia's larger cities. The only Australian capital cities without multi-modal networks are Darwin and Hobart. The table does not include tourist or heritage transport modes (such as the private monorail at Sea World or the tourist Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram).\nIntercity rail transport.\nThe railway network is large, comprising a total of 33,819\u00a0km (2,540\u00a0km electrified) of track: 3,719\u00a0km broad gauge, 15,422\u00a0km standard gauge, 14,506\u00a0km narrow gauge and 172\u00a0km dual gauge. Rail transport started in the various colonies on different dates. Privately owned railways started the first lines, and struggled to succeed on a remote, huge, and sparsely populated continent, and government railways dominated. Although the various colonies had been advised by London to choose a common gauge, the colonies ended up with different gauges.\nInter-state rail services.\nJourney Beyond operates four trains: the \"Indian Pacific\" (Sydney-Adelaide-Perth), \"The Ghan\" (Adelaide-Alice Springs-Darwin), \"The Overland\" (Melbourne-Adelaide), and the \"Great Southern\" (Brisbane-Melbourne-Adelaide). NSW Government owned NSW TrainLink services link Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Dubbo, Broken Hill, Armidale, Moree and Griffith to Sydney. Since the extension of the Ghan from Alice Springs to Darwin was completed in 2004, all mainland Australian capital cities are linked by standard gauge rail, for the first time.\nIntra-state and city rail services.\nThere are various state and city rail services operated by a combination of government and private entities, the most prominent of these include V/Line (regional trains and coaches in Victoria); Metro Trains Melbourne (suburban services in Melbourne); NSW TrainLink (regional trains and coaches in New South Wales); Sydney Trains (suburban services in Sydney); Queensland Rail (QR) operating long-distance Traveltrain services and the City network in South-East Queensland, and Transwa operating train and bus services in Western Australia.\nIn Tasmania, TasRail operates a short-haul narrow gauge freight system, that carries inter-modal and bulk mining goods. TasRail is owned by the Government of Tasmania and is going through significant below and above rail upgrades with new locomotives and wagons entering service. Significant bridge and sleeper renewal have also occurred. The Tasmanian Government also operates the West Coast Wilderness Railway as a tourist venture over an isolated length of track on Tasmania's West Coast.\nMining railways.\nSix heavy-duty mining railways carry iron ore to ports in the northwest of Western Australia. These railways carry no other traffic and are isolated by deserts from all other railways. The lines are standard gauge and are built to the heaviest US standards. Each line is operated by one of either BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue and Hancock Prospecting.\nA common carrier railway was proposed to serve the port of Oakajee Port just north of Geraldton, but this was later cancelled after a collapse in the iron ore price.\nCane railways.\nIn Queensland, 19 sugar mills are serviced by ~3,000\u00a0km of narrow gauge ( gauge) cane tramways that deliver sugar cane to the mills.\nPipelines.\nThere are several pipeline systems including:\n\"Projects under construction or planned:\"\nVictoria\nWaterways.\nBetween 1850 and 1940, paddle steamers were used extensively on the Murray-Darling Basin to transport produce, especially wool and wheat, to river ports such as Echuca, Mannum and Goolwa. However, the water levels of the inland waterways are highly unreliable, making the rivers impassable for large parts of the year. A system of locks was created largely to overcome this variability, but the steamers were unable to compete with rail, and later, road transport. Traffic on inland waterways is now largely restricted to private recreational craft.\nMerchant marine vessels.\nIn 2006, the Australian fleet consisted of 53 ships of 1,000 gross tonnage or over. The use of foreign registered ships to carry Australian cargoes between Australian ports is permitted under a permit scheme, with either Single Voyage Permit (SVP) or a Continuous Voyage Permit (CVP) being issued to ships. Between 1996 and 2002 the number of permits issued has increased by about 350 per cent.\nOver recent years the number of Australian registered and flagged ships has greatly declined, from 75 ships in 1996 to less than 40 in 2007, by 2009 the number is\nnow approaching 30. Marine unions blame the decline on the shipping policy of the Howard government which permitted foreign ships to carry coastal traffic.\nThere have also been cases where locally operated ships have an Australian flag from the vessel, registering it overseas under a flag of convenience, then hiring foreign crews who earn up to about half the monthly rate of Australian sailors. Such moves were supported by the Howard government but opposed by maritime unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The registration of the ships overseas also meant the earnings of the ships are not subject to Australian corporate taxation laws.\nAviation.\nQantas is the flag carrier of Australia. Australian National Airways was the predominant domestic carrier from the mid-1930s to the early 1950s. After World War II, Qantas was nationalised and its domestic operations were transferred to Trans Australia Airlines in 1946. The Two Airlines Policy was formally established in 1952 to ensure the viability of both airlines. However, ANA's leadership was quickly eroded by TAA, and it was acquired by Ansett Airways in 1957. The duopoly continued for the next four decades. In the mid-1990s TAA was merged with Qantas and later privatised. Ansett collapsed in September 2001. In the following years, Virgin Australia became a challenger to Qantas. Both companies launched low-cost subsidiaries Jetstar and Tigerair Australia respectively.\nOverseas flights from Australia to the United Kingdom via the Eastern Hemisphere are known as the Kangaroo Route, whereas flights via the Western Hemisphere are known as the Southern Cross Route. In 1948, the first commercial flight from Australia to Africa was flown by Qantas, launching what is known as the Wallaby Route. In 1954, the first flight from Australia to North America was completed, as a 60-passenger Qantas aircraft connected Sydney with San Francisco and Vancouver, having fuel stops at Fiji, Canton Island and Hawaii. In November 1982, a Pan Am 747SP flew the first non-stop commercial flight from Los Angeles to Sydney. Airport transfer provides a seamless and efficient transportation solution for travelers. A non-stop flight between Australia and Europe was first completed in March 2018 from Perth to London.\nThere are many airports around Australia paved or unpaved. A 2004 estimate put the number of airports at 448. The busiest airports in Australia are:\nAirports by runway length.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\n\u2021 2004 estimate\nEnvironmental impact.\nThe environmental impact of transport in Australia is considerable. In 2009, transport emissions made up 15.3% of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions. Between 1990 and 2009, transport emissions grew by 34.6%, the second-highest growth rate in emissions after stationary energy.\nThe Australian Energy Regulator and state agencies such as the New South Wales Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal set and regulate electricity prices, thereby lowering production and consumer cost.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The Slovenes (also called 'Windische') form a closely knit community. Their rights as well as those of the Croats are protected by law and generally respected in practice. The present boundaries of Austria, once the center of the Habsburg monarchy that constituted the second-largest composite monarchy in Europe, were established in accordance with the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye in 1919. Some Austrians, particularly near Vienna, still have relatives in countries that made up the Monarchy, namely Croatia, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.\nNew ethnic minorities in Austria.\nAustria does not collect data on the ethnicity or race of its citizens but does collect data on the nationality of residents currently in the country.\nAccording to the Austrian Statistical Bureau, 814,800 foreigners legally lived in Austria in mid-2006, representing 9.8% of the total population, one of the highest rates in Europe.\nOf these foreign residents, 305,100 came from the former Yugoslavia and 110,800 from Turkey.\nOwing to a growing naturalization rate, 330,000 people have been naturalized between 1985 and the end of 2003, representing about 4% of the 7.4\u00a0million Austrian citizens living today in the country.\nOf these new citizens 110,000 came from the former Yugoslavia and 90,000 from Turkey. Considering pre-1985 naturalizations, in 2005 at least 18% (in Vienna more than 30%) of the population was either foreign or of foreign origin. Native Austrians have had stagnant demographics since World War I, and have been in absolute decline since the 1970s.\nImmigration.\nAs of 2011, Statistik Austria official estimates have shown that 81% of residents, or 6.75\u00a0million had no migration background and more than 19% or 1.6\u00a0million inhabitants had at least one parent of immigrant background. There are more than 415,000 descendants of foreign-born immigrants residing in Austria, the great majority of whom have been naturalized.\nAccording to Eurostat, there were 1.27\u00a0million foreign-born residents in Austria in 2010, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU member state.\n350,000 ethnic Turks (including a minority of Turkish Kurds) currently live in Austria. At about 3% of the total population, they make up the biggest single ethnic minority in Austria.\nIn 2018, the percentage of foreign born people was around 19% of the total population which is also the second highest foreign born proportion of all EU countries after Luxembourg.\nMigration data of Austria, 2013\u2013present.\nAs of 2023[ [update]], the most common groups of foreign residents in Austria were as follows:\nNaturalisation.\nForeign nationals may apply for Austrian citizenship under the following preconditions: at least 10 years of continuous stay in Austria (a minimum of five years of which as a permanent resident), sufficient financial means/secure income, no criminal record, sufficient knowledge of the German language, positive attitude towards the Republic of Austria. EEA citizens may apply for citizenship after six years of permanent residence in Austria.\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIn 2001, about 74% of Austria's population were registered as Roman Catholic, while about 5% considered themselves Protestants. Austrian Christians, both Catholic and Protestant, are obliged to pay a mandatory membership fee (calculated by income\u2014about 1%) to their church; this payment is called \"Kirchenbeitrag\" (\"Ecclesiastical/Church contribution\"). Since the second half of the 20th century, the number of adherents and churchgoers has declined. Data for the end of 2016 from the Austrian Roman Catholic church lists 5,162,622 members, or 58.8% of the total Austrian population. Sunday church attendance was 605,828 or 7% of the total Austrian population in 2015. The Lutheran church also recorded a loss of 74,421 adherents between 2001 and 2016.\nAbout 12% of the population declared that they have no religion in 2001; this share had grown to 20% by 2015. Of the remaining people, around 340,000 were registered as members of various Muslim communities in 2001, mainly due to the influx from Turkey, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo. The number of Muslims has doubled in 15 years to 700,000 in 2016. About 680,000 are members of Eastern Orthodox Church (mostly Romanians and Serbs), about 21,000 people are active Jehovah's Witnesses and about 8,100 are Jewish.\nAn estimated 15,000 Jews or adherents of Judaism live in Austria, primarily in Vienna \u2013 a remnant of the post-World War II community after the Nazi Holocaust.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67635", "revid": "20542576", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67635", "title": "Politics of Austria", "text": " \nPolitics in Austria reflects the dynamics of competition among multiple political parties, which led to the formation of a Conservative-Green coalition government for the first time in January 2020, following the snap elections of 29 September 2019, and the election of a former Green Party leader to the presidency in 2016.\nAustrian politics takes place within the constitutional framework of a federal semi-presidential republic, with a President (\"Bundespr\u00e4sident\") serving as head of state and a Chancellor (\"Bundeskanzler\") as head of government. Governments, both local and federal, exercise executive power. Federal legislative power is vested both in the Federal Government and in the two chambers of Parliament; the National Council (\"Nationalrat\") and the Federal Council (\"Bundesrat\"). The Judiciary of Austria is independent of the executive and legislative branches of government.\nFollowing the end the Second World War and re-establishment of Austria as a sovereign state, the conservative Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) and the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Austria (SP\u00d6) dominated politics and public life for decades, with only one additional party\u2014the FP\u00d6\u2014playing a significant role at the national level. More recently, the pattern of two-party dominance withered with the rise of newer parties, such as the Greens and the NEOS.\nThe ethnically and culturally heterogeneous nation-state of Austria is one of the many remnant states of Austria-Hungary, a vast multinational empire that ceased to exist in 1918. The Austrian Republic was preceded by a constitutional monarchy, whose legislative body was elected by, as \"The New York Times\" put it, \"quasi-universal (male) suffrage\" for the first time in 1897.\nAustria's first attempt at republican governance after the fall of the monarchy in 1918 was severely hampered by the crippling economic burden of war reparations required by the victorious Allies. Austria's First Republic (1918\u20131938) made some pioneering reforms in the 1920s, particularly in Vienna, that served as models for the social-welfare states of post-World War I Europe. However, the Republic gradually developed into the Austrofascist dictatorship between 1933 and 1934 under Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss, who was assassinated by Nazi party agents in 1934. The First Republic ended with the \"Anschluss\" (annexation) to Nazi Germany in 1938. Following the defeat of the German Reich in 1945 Austria resumed its republican government, after it fully regained its independence from the occupying Allied Powers. Austria's political system after re-establishment of democracy and self-determination is referred to as the Second Republic.\nThe beginning of the 21st century marked, for Austria, a half-century of a stable government under a constitutional federal republican system. It is governed according to the principles of representative democracy and the rule of law. The constitutional framework of the politics of Austria and the marrow of the constitution's practical implementation are widely agreed to be robust and adequately conducive to peaceful change.\nAustria was the 35th most electoral democratic country in the world in 2023 according to the V-Dem Democracy indices.\nConstitution.\nAustria's constitution characterizes the republic as a federation consisting of nine autonomous federal states (\"Bundesl\u00e4nder\"). Both the federation and all its states have written constitutions defining them as republican entities governed according to the principles of representative democracy. Aside from the fact that the states of Austria lack an independent judiciary on the one hand and that their autonomy is largely notional on the other hand, Austria's government structure resembles that of larger federal republics such as Germany.\nExecutive branch.\nHead of State.\nAustria's head of state is the Federal President (\"Bundespr\u00e4sident\"), elected by popular vote for a term of six years and limited to two consecutive terms of office. Former president Heinz Fischer was elected for a second term on 25 April 2010. He was succeeded by President Alexander Van der Bellen, who was elected on 4 December 2016. The office of the Federal President is largely ceremonial, although the constitution allows the president to dismiss the cabinet as a whole or to dissolve the National Council and call new elections.\nHead of Government.\nThe Federal Chancellor (\"Bundeskanzler\") is appointed by the Federal President. Although he is head of government, he has no power to direct other members of the government. Following the Ibiza affair, on 30 May 2019, President Van der Bellen appointed President of the Constitutional Court Brigitte Bierlein to serve as Federal Chancellor of a technocratic interim government until the formation and installation of a new political government following the parliamentary elections to be held later that year.\nGovernment.\nThe federal cabinet consists of the Federal Chancellor appointed by the president and a number of ministers appointed by the president on the recommendation of the chancellor. The federal cabinet answers to the National Council and can be forced to resign through a motion of no confidence.\nBrigitte Bierlein's cabinet consisted of top civil servants (\"Spitzenbeamten)\" and current and retired jurors. Clemens Jabloner was Vice-chancellor.\nBased on the results of the 29 September 2019 National Council elections, in which the \u00d6VP emerged as the strongest party, the president asked Sebastian Kurz to form a new coalition government. Van der Bellen, formerly a leader of the Green Party, expressed the wish for high inclusion of women in the new cabinet. Women had parity in the caretaker government.\nLegislative branch.\nThe Parliament of Austria (\"Parlament\") consists of two chambers. The National Council (\"Nationalrat\") has 183 members, elected for a five-year term by proportional representation. It is the predominant one of the two chambers.\nTo be represented in the National Council, a party needs to either win at least four percent of votes across the nation or win a seat (\"Direktmandat\") in one of the 43 regional constituencies.\nThe Federal Council (\"Bundesrat\") consists of 62 members and is less powerful. Its members are selected by the state legislatures (\"Landtage\"). The apportionment of seats to the individual states is recalculated after each census. The power of the Federal Council is rather limited. In most cases it has only a suspensive veto, which can be overruled by the National Council. In some situations, however, such as for example legislation that imposes limits on the competences of the provinces, Federal Council approval is required.\nThe Federal Assembly (\"Bundesversammlung\"), which is formed by National Council and Federal Council in joint session, is largely a ceremonial institution. Its main responsibility is the swearing-in of the Federal President. It can also call a referendum on the removal of the president from office or bring the president before the Constitutional Court if it concludes that the president violated the constitution, and is ultimately responsible for declaring war.\nFollowing the accession to the European Union, Austria's parliament had to cede some of its power to European Union institutions.\nA convention, the Austrian Convention (\"\u00d6sterreich Konvent\"), was established in 2003 to develop proposals for a reform of the Austrian constitution and central government institutions. It presented a report in 2007, with some of its proposals adopted by parliament.\nDirect democracy.\nAustria's legal system distinguished between three different instruments of direct democracy: referendums (\"Volksabstimmungen\"), popular initiatives (\"Volksbegehren\") and national opinion polls (\"Volksbefragungen\").\nA referendum on a bill is to be held if a majority of the National Council's members demand it or by a resolution of the President, which has to be counter-signed by all members of government. Also, substantial changes to the constitution always require a referendum, while changes to parts of the constitution only require a referendum if at least one third of the members of the National Council or if the Federal Council demands it. The result of a referendum is binding and the bill in question is not passed into law if a majority votes against it. Until now there have been two referendums in Austria, the most recent being on its entry into the European Union.\nPopular initiatives can start a legislative process: if a popular initiative is signed by at least 100,000 registered voters, the National Council has to consider it. It takes precedence over all other matters on the National Council's agenda. As of 2010, 32 initiatives have taken place since their introduction in 1963.\nNational opinion polls or consultative referendums are held, unlike referendums, before the National Council passes a law. Its results are not legally binding. As of 2015, there has only been one national opinion poll.\nPolitical parties.\nAustrian People's Party.\nThe People's Party (\"\u00d6sterreichische Volkspartei\", or \u00d6VP, since rebranded \"Die Neue Volkspartei\") was founded by leaders of the former Christian Social Party in 1945 as a conservative/Centre-right party with loose ties to the Catholic Church. Between 1945 and 1970 it provided the Chancellor of Austria and since 1987 it has continuously been in government, its leader Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel serving as Chancellor between 2000 and 2007. It finds support from farmers, large and small business owners, and lay Catholic groups, but also from voters without party affiliation, with strongholds in the rural regions of Austria. In the nationwide elections in 2008 it finished second with 26% of the vote, the worst result in the party's history. Since 1991 the party is a member of the European People's Party.\nAfter the collapse of the \u00d6VP-led coalition government with the FP\u00d6, the \u00d6VP performed well in the snap elections held on 29 September 2019, gaining 9 additional seats, while support for the FP\u00d6 dropped sharply, resulting in a loss of 20 seats. The President of Austria accordingly asked \u00d6VP leader Sebastian Kurz to commence coalition talks to form a new government.\nA few days later, Kurz formed his second ruling coalition between his conservative \u00d6VP party and the Greens. In July 2020, the coalition set up its new center to deal with \"political Islam\" and its \"dangerous ideology.\"\nSocial Democratic Party of Austria.\nThe Social Democratic Party (, or SP\u00d6) is a social democratic/centre-left political party that was founded in 1888 as the Social Democratic Worker's Party (, or SDAP), when Victor Adler managed to unite the various opposing factions. The party was reconstituted as the Socialist Party of Austria in 1945 (renamed to the Social Democratic Party of Austria in 1991) after being outlawed in 1934. Between 1970 and 1999, it governed the country either alone or with a junior partner, and all but three of the Presidents of Austria since 1945 have either been members of the SP\u00d6 or nominated by it. Originally having a high following among blue-collar workers, it sought to expand its focus on middle class and white-collar workers in the late 1950s. In the 1990s, it started viewing privatisation of nationalised industries more openly, after large losses of state owned enterprises came to light. Following the 2008 financial crisis, the party started advocating a global transaction tax. It finished first in the National Council election of 2008 with 29.3% of the vote. The party is a member of the Socialist International and the Party of European Socialists.\nUnlike the \u00d6VP, the SP\u00d6 has been less successful in reinventing itself and adopting to a new political landscape. It suffered heavy losses in the 2019 National Council elections, ending up with a dozen seats fewer than in the previous legislative session. The party intended to rebuild and serve as opposition to the \u00d6VP-led coalition government under Kurz.\nIn January 2020 the SP\u00d6 received almost 50% of the votes in regional elections in the State of Burgenland under the leadership of Hans Peter Doskozil, which gave him an absolute majority of seats in the Landtag, and allows him to govern without the support of a junior coalition partner. This surprising success raises the possibility that the SP\u00d6 could reverse recent setbacks at the national level likewise.\nFreedom Party of Austria.\nThe Freedom Party (\"Freiheitliche Partei \u00d6sterreichs\", or FP\u00d6) is a right-wing populist political party that was founded in 1955 as a successor to the Federation of Independents. According to polls, it mainly attracts votes from young people and workers. Their nationalist rhetoric targets Muslims, immigrants and the European Union. The party steadily gained support after J\u00f6rg Haider took over leadership of the party in 1986, until it attracted about 27% of the vote in the 1999 elections. After being reduced to 10% in the 2002 elections, they achieved 17.5% in 2008.\nThanks to their strong performance in the 2017 national elections, the FP\u00d6 became the junior partner in a government led by the \u00d6VP under Sebastian Kurz as Chancellor, but the government was ousted through a vote of no confidence as a result of a political scandal involving the FP\u00d6's leader, dubbed the Ibiza affair. The FP\u00d6 suffered punishing losses in subsequent federal and state elections. It expelled its longtime leader H-C Strache, who set up his own party to run in the 2020 Vienna local elections, but failed to reach the 5% threshold to sit in the city parliament.\nThe Greens - The Green Alternative.\nThe Greens (\"Die Gr\u00fcnen\"), a party focusing on environmental and social justice issues as part of the worldwide Green movement, received 10.4% of the vote in 2008. They are particularly strong in the city areas, for example in Vienna, where they received 22% of the votes in the 2004 EU-elections. In Neubau they received 41% of the votes, more than SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP combined. The Greens attract left-liberal intellectuals and voters from 18 to 30. Some insist on characterizing the Greens as leftists because they are perceived to be anti-capitalist and certainly employ anti-corporate rhetoric and less business friendly policies. However, this labeling confuses the differences between the Greens\u2014who place a great deal of faith in local markets and direct democracy\u2014and left-Socialists and Communists who tend to favor centralization and planned economies and economic class issues.\nThe Green Party suffered internal strife and fissure in 2017 and failed to surmount the 4% threshold in the national elections held that year. It thus lost all of its seats in the National Council, but made a spectacular comeback in snap elections of September 2019, with a vote share of 13.9% and 25 seats. Their strong showing, combined with the steep losses of the scandal-ridden FP\u00d6, made them a possible coalition partner for the People's Party, which had won the largest number of votes and seats of all parties with Sebastian Kurz as its candidate to become Chancellor of Austria for the second time. Following two months of intense negotiations, Kurz and Green Party leader Werner Kogler announced a coalition agreement on New Year's Day 2020. The new cabinet was sworn in by President Van der Bellen a week later.\nNEOS \u2013 The New Austria and Liberal Forum.\nThe Liberal Forum (\"Liberales Forum\", or LIF), founded on libertarian ideals, split from the FP\u00d6 in February 1993. It received 3.65% of the vote in the 1999 election and thus failed to pass the 4% threshold necessary for representation in the lower house of parliament (\"Nationalrat\"). After being reduced to under 1% in the 2002 election, they disappeared almost completely from public view, receiving 2.1% of the votes in 2008. In 2013 the LIF made a party alliance with the classic-centre liberal NEOS for the legislative election and entered into the National Council. In 2014, the parties merged.\nThe NEOS achieved their best result ever in the 2019 National Council elections, with 8.1% of the votes and 15 seats, a gain of five seats over the previous elections in 2017, but this number was insufficient to qualify them as a viable junior coalition party with the leading \u00d6VP.\nElections.\nSummary of the 2019 Austrian legislative election results\nSee: 2017 Austrian legislative election and 2019 Austrian legislative election\nPolitical conditions.\nSince World War II, Austria has enjoyed political stability. A Socialist elder statesman, Dr. Karl Renner, organized an Austrian administration in the aftermath of the war, and general elections were held in November 1945. In that election, the conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP) obtained 50% of the vote (85 seats) in the National Council, the Socialists won 45% (76 seats), and the communists won 5% (4 seats). The ensuing three-party government ruled until 1947, when the communists left the government and the \u00d6VP led a governing coalition with the socialists that governed until 1966. In that year, the \u00d6VP won an absolute majority and ruled alone for the next four years. The tables turned in 1970, when the SP\u00d6 became the strongest party for the first time, winning an absolute majority under its charismatic leader Bruno Kreisky in 1971. Between 1971 and 1999, the SP\u00d6 ruled the country either alone or in conjunction with the \u00d6VP, except from 1983 to 1986, when it governed in coalition with the Freedom Party, until the coalition broke when the right-wing politician J\u00f6rg Haider became the leader of the Freedom Party.\nAfter the election of 1999, despite emerging only in third place after the elections, the \u00d6VP formed a coalition with the right wing-populist Freedom Party (FP\u00d6) in early 2000. The SP\u00d6, which was the strongest party in the 1999 elections, and the Greens now form the opposition. As a result of the inclusion of the FP\u00d6 on the government, the EU imposed symbolic sanctions on Austria, which were revoked six months later. The USA and Israel, as well as various other countries, also reduced contacts with the Austrian Government. The \u00d6VP was re-elected, this time with a plurality of votes, in the 2002 elections, and formed another coalition government with the FP\u00d6, this time largely ignored by other countries.\nAfter major disputes inside the FP\u00d6 between Haider and vice-chancellor Susanne Riess-Passer (the so-called \"Knittelfeld Putsch\"), the \u00d6VP broke the coalition in 2002 and called for re-elections. Riess-Passer left the FP\u00d6, and the former Minister of Social Services, Herbert Haupt, was appointed as new leader. In a brilliant marketing move, Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel convinced the then very popular Minister of Finance Karl-Heinz Grasser to change from the FP\u00d6 to the \u00d6VP.\nNot only was the FP\u00d6 publicly blamed for breaking the coalition and had lost Minister Grasser to the \u00d6VP, their style of government and broken promises also left many of their former voters disillusioned. In the elections, which were held on 24 November 2002, they suffered the biggest loss of votes in Austria's history, going down from 27% to only 10%. Most of these losses went to the \u00d6VP, which went up from 26% to 42%, the highest value for decades. Both Greens and Social Democrats gained votes, but not enough to form a coalition with only 85 of 183 seats.\nAgainst public opinion, which was in favour of an \u00d6VP-SP\u00d6 coalition government, Chancellor Sch\u00fcssel renewed the coalition between the \u00d6VP and FP\u00d6.\nDespite being exposed to fierce criticism from the opposition parties for failed or highly unfavorable privatization deals, the highest tax rates and unemployment figures since 1945, a questionable fighter jet purchase and repeated accusations that Finance Minister Grasser may have evaded taxes, the government seems to be the most stable in decades as both parties are afraid of losing votes. Recent law changes concerning the police, the national television and radio company, the federal railways and the social security system have led to an increase of the \u00d6VP's and FP\u00d6's influence in these bodies.\nThe Social Democratic Party of Austria emerged as the strongest party in the 2006 elections forming a government with the Austrian People's Party, SP\u00d6 party leader Alfred Gusenbauer becoming the new Chancellor.\nThe Social Democratic Party under Alfred Gusenbauer emerged as the winner of Austria's general election in October 2006. After negotiations with the \u00d6VP were successfully concluded Alfred Gusenbauer and his SP\u00d6-\u00d6VP coalition government were sworn in on 11 January 2007, by President Heinz Fischer.\nThis coalition broke up again in June 2008. Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties, Social Democrats and People's Party, but together they still hold more than 50% of the votes with the Social Democrats holding the majority. The Freedom Party and the recently deceased J\u00f6rg Haider's new party Alliance for the Future of Austria, both right-wing parties, were strengthened. Due to the surge of the right at the last elections, many speculated that any government coalition would include at least one of the two far-right parties. This idea was put to rest when both the Social Democrats and the People's Party stated that neither of them would work with the Freedom Party or the Alliance for the Future of Austria. Lengthy negotiations led to a renewed \"grand coalition\" consisting of the Social Democrats and the People's Party. Thus A snap election in 2008 saw both government parties losing votes, however, the coalition between SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP was renewed, with Werner Faymann, the new leader of the SP\u00d6, following Alfred Gusenbauer as Chancellor.\nOn 17 May 2016, Christian Kern from Social Democrats (SP\u00d6) was sworn in as new chancellor. He continued governing in a \"grand coalition\" with the conservative People's Party (\u00d6VP). He took the office after former chancellor, also from SP\u00d6, Werner Faymann's resignation.\nThe Austrian People's Party and The Greens \u2013 The Green Alternative formed a coalition government on 1 January 2020, marking the first time the Greens have gained power. A week later, Austria's first female-majority cabinet was sworn in and Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, 33, reclaimed the distinction of being the world's youngest head of government.\nOn 11 October 2021, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz resigned, after pressure triggered by a corruption scandal. Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg of \u00d6VP succeeded him as chancellor. Following a corruption scandal involving the ruling People's Party, Austria got its third conservative chancellor in two months after Karl Nehammer was sworn into office on 6 December 2021. His predecessor Alexander Schallenberg had left the office after less than two months. \u00d6VP and the Greens continued to govern together.\nPolitical pressure groups and lobbies.\nState-approved, compulsory-membership chambers of labour, commerce and agriculture, as well as by trade unions and lobbyist groups exercise sometimes significant influence on the Federal Government. Decisions of the so-called Austrian Social Partnership (\"Sozialpartnerschaft\"), consisting of the trade union and the chambers of commerce, labour and farmers, affect a number of Austrian laws and policies, for example its labour law and labour market policy.\nOverview of groups.\nAustrian National Union of Students (\u00d6H), Austrian Trade Union Federation (\u00d6GB), Chamber of Labor (AK), Conference of the Presidents of Farmers' Chambers, Economic Chamber of Austria (WKO), Federation of Austrian Industry (VOeI), Roman Catholic Church, including its chief lay organization, Catholic Action.\nForeign relations.\nIn 1955 Austria passed the Declaration of Neutrality declaring the country permanently neutral, on which Austria based her foreign policy from then on. In the 1990s the meaning of this neutrality was changed with Austria becoming a member of the European Union in 1995 and her participation in UN peacekeeping missions. Since the start of 2009 Austria is a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.\nInternational organization participation.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

According to international organizations such as Freedom House, Amnesty International, and Human Rights Watch, elections in Azerbaijan are not considered free or fair, political opposition faces repression, and human rights abuses are widespread. Power is largely concentrated in the hands of President Ilham Aliyev and members of his extended family.\nAzerbaijan is nominally a semi-presidential republic, with the President of Azerbaijan as the head of state, and the Prime Minister of Azerbaijan as head of government. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. Checks and balances are nominally ensured by the legislature (Azerbaijan's National Assembly) and the Judiciary but both institutions are in practice firmly controlled by the executive.\nThe politics of Azerbaijan have since 1969 been dominated by the Aliyev family. Heydar Aliyev governed Soviet Azerbaijan from 1969 to 1982 as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan, and as President of Azerbaijan from 1993 to 2003 after seizing power in the aftermath of a 1993 military coup. Ilham Aliyev, Heydar's son, was installed as president in 2003.\nPolitical history.\nAzerbaijan declared its independence from the former Soviet Union on August 30, 1991, with Ayaz Mutalibov, former First Secretary of the Azerbaijani Communist Party, becoming the country's first President. Following a massacre of Azerbaijanis at Khojali in Nagorno-Karabakh in March 1992, Mutalibov resigned and the country experienced a period of political fragility. The old guard returned Mutalibov to power in May 1992, but less than a week later his efforts to suspend scheduled presidential elections and ban all political activity prompted the opposition Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (PFP) to organize a resistance movement and take power. Among its reforms, the PFP dissolved the predominantly Communist Supreme Soviet and transferred its functions to the 50-member upper house of the legislature, the National Council.\nElections in June 1992 resulted in the selection of PFP leader Abulfaz Elchibey as the country's second president. The national presidential elections with 7 candidates were held on 7 June 1992 in which Elchibey was elected the President of Azerbaijan, gaining 54% of votes and becoming Azerbaijan's first democratically elected, non-communist president. During the summer of 1992, Elchibey secured the full withdrawal of the Soviet army from Azerbaijan, which became the first and only former Soviet republic (after the Baltic states) free of Soviet military presence. At the same time, Elchibey's government established the national Caspian Navy and managed to reach an agreement with Russia on receiving one-quarter of the Soviet Caspian Navy based in Baku.\nThe National Council conferred presidential powers upon its new speaker, Heydar Aliyev, former First Secretary of the Azerbaijani Communist Party (1969\u201381) and later a member of the Soviet Union's Politburo, the KGB, and USSR Deputy Prime Minister (until 1987). Elchibey was formally deposed by a national referendum in August 1993, and Aliyev was elected to a 5-year term as President in October with only token opposition. Aliyev won re-election to another 5-year term in 1998. According to conclusions of OSCE ODIHR election observation report \"clear political will was demonstrated by the authorities of the Republic of Azerbaijan to significantly improve on the election practice of the country. The efforts in this direction were initiated in the late spring of 1998 by a review of the election legislation to put it in line with OSCE commitments, by the formal abolishment of censorship in August 1998 and by the final approval of the new Citizenship Law in late September 1998. In this way the authorities responded positively to concerns raised by the international community and indicated their willingness to meet international standards in the conduct of the election process\".\nThe Speaker of Parliament stood next in line to the President, but the constitution was changed at the end of 2002: now the premier is next in line. In August 2003, \u0130lham Aliyev was appointed as premier. In the October 2003 presidential elections, \u0130lham Aliyev was the winner and was sworn in as president at the end of the same month, and Rasizade was appointed premier again.\nElections in Azerbaijan tend to be fairly predictable affairs, with little analysis needed. President Ilham Aliyev and his New Azerbaijan Party keep an iron grip on power through fraudulent votes; international observers have never deemed an election in the country to be free and fair. In April 2018, President Ilham Aliyev secured his fourth consecutive term in the election that was boycotted by the main opposition parties as fraudulent.\nExecutive branch.\nPresident is the head of the state and chief of the executive branch. The people elect the president; the Vice President is appointed by the President and the Prime Minister is nominated by the President and confirmed by the National Assembly of Azerbaijan. Presidential term is seven years. The President appoints all cabinet-level government officials (ministers, heads of other central executive bodies) and heads of local executive bodies.\nSince 2008, the Constitution of Azerbaijan was amended, abolishing any term limit for the office of President. Last Constitutional reform took place in September 2016 and introduced the office of Vice President.\nPresident.\nAccording to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan is the head of state and possesses executive power. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan represents the country in internal and external affairs. The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan ensures the independence and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, and guarantees compliance with international treaties.\nThe President in Azerbaijan is directly elected for a 7-year term, with the candidate required to have the right to vote, residing in Azerbaijani territory for more than 10 years, possess a higher education, lack citizenship or liabilities to the foreign states, and not convicted for a serious crime.\nThe President could be removed by the National Assembly following conviction by the Supreme Court, if the decision is adopted by three-quarters majority of the deputies. Otherwise, the President enjoys personal immunity.\nThe Constitution endows the President with the following powers:\nVice Presidents.\nThe Vice-Presidents of Azerbaijan are high-ranking officials subordinate to the President. First Vice-President and Vice-Presidents are appointed and dismissed by the President. In case of an early resignation of the president, within 60 days, as long as the new elections are called, the president's powers are fulfilled by the First Vice-President of Azerbaijan. The First Vice-President of Azerbaijan enjoys inviolability; can not be detained or brought to criminal responsibility, except in cases of detention at the scene of a crime, can not be searched or personally searched.\nAny citizen with a higher education who has the right to vote and has no obligations to other states can become a vice-president of Azerbaijan. Vice-presidents have the right to immunity.\nLegislative branch.\nThe National Assembly of Azerbaijan () is the legislative branch of government in Azerbaijan. The unicameral National Assembly consists of 125 deputies elected in single-member constituencies. \nOfficially voting is free, individual and secret. Candidates may be self-nominated or nominated by political parties, their blocs or groups of voters. All citizens over 18 years of age have the right to vote, except those recognised as incapable by a court. Every citizen of at least 25 years of age may be elected with certain exceptions (i.e. dual citizenship, liabilities towards a foreign state, holding a position in the executive or judicial branches of power, remunerated activities - with certain exceptions, such as members of religious professions, incapacity confirmed by court, conviction for a serious crime or serving a sentence). The validity of election results is confirmed in respect of each candidate by the Constitutional Court, and the National Assembly is constituted upon confirmation in office of 83 deputies. \nEvery year, the National Assembly of the Republic of Azerbaijan holds two regular, spring and autumn, sessions. Extraordinary sessions are convened by its Speaker at the request of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan or 42 deputies of the National Assembly. The meetings of the sessions of the National Assembly of the Republic of Azerbaijan are open to the public. A meeting of the session of the Milli Majlis may be closed to the public on the proposal of 83 members of parliament or the proposal of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The assembly is headed by the Speaker of Milli Majlis assisted by the First Deputy Speaker and two deputy speakers. Ogtay Asadov is the current speaker of the assembly, Ziyafet Asgarov is the First Deputy Speaker and, Bahar Muradova and Valeh Alasgarov are deputy speakers. Currently (for the term of 2015-2010) 21 women and 104 men deputies are elected in National Assembly. The National Assembly is divided into 15 Committees according to the areas they are focused. Its structure also includes Chamber of Accounts, Toponymic Commission, Disciplinary Commission and Azerbaijan newspaper.\nA legislative initiative can be taken by an MP, the President of the Republic, the Supreme Court, the Prosecutor's Office, the NAR Supreme Council and a group of 40 thousand citizens who are eligible to vote. The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is a constituent part of Azerbaijan with its own elected parliament (the Supreme Council) consisting of 45 deputies. Elections to the Supreme Council are regulated by the Nakhchivan Constitution.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nAzerbaijan is considered a one party dominant state. Opposition parties against the New Azerbaijan Party are repressed and none of the post-1992 elections have been free and fair. Opposition parties are repressed. They have frequently been blocked from running in elections or they have boycotted elections due to the undemocratic conduct of the elections.\nThe ruling New Azerbaijan Party, headed by Ilham Aliyev, controls all the electoral commissions in Azerbaijan.\nCabinet of Ministers.\nThe Cabinet of Ministers is the chief executive body under the authority of the President. The Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, and Heads of other central executive organs are appointed and dismissed by the President. The Cabinet dissolves on the start of term by the newly elected President, who instead appoints a new Cabinet.\nThe powers of the Cabinet include drafting the state budget and presenting it to the president, executing the budget, implementing state economic and social programs, securing financial and credit and monetary policy, managing ministries and other executive bodies of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nThe 8th Government of Azerbaijan is the cabinet in its current formation.\nJudicial branch.\nAlthough the Azerbaijan constitution nominally guarantees judicial independence, the executive firmly controls judges and prosecutors. Judges and prosecutors collaborate in Azerbaijan to repress political opponents.\nJudicial power is administered by the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court, the courts of appeal, ordinary and specialised courts. The judicial system and legal proceedings are determined by law, and the establishment of extraordinary courts is prohibited. The Supreme Court of Azerbaijan is a supreme judicial body on civil, criminal and other cases related to the execution of general and specialized courts. The Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan is the supreme body of constitutional justice on the matters attributed to its jurisdiction by the Constitution, with authority to interpret and apply the Constitution of Azerbaijan. The Constitutional Court consists of nine judges appointed for a non-renewable 15-year term. Judges of Constitutional Court of the Republic of Azerbaijan are appointed by Milli Majlis (National Assembly) of the Republic of Azerbaijan on recommendation by the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Any person may appeal before it for the restoration of their infringed rights and freedoms. The 2003 Law on the Constitutional Court defines the Court's activities, as well as the status and duties of its judges. The Court's decisions are published and their execution is mandatory.\nThe court system comprises three levels. The first level includes 86 district/city courts, 5 serious crime courts, 6 military courts and 7 economic courts. Cases are heard by a single judge or a panel of judges. The second level consists of 6 courts of appeal (\u201chigher courts\u201d), and the third level - the Supreme Court - is the highest judicial body for civil, criminal, economic and military matters. It reviews the decisions of appeal courts and clarifies judicial practice. The courts in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic are part of the court system. The Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic Supreme Court serves as the appeal instance and its rulings are considered in cassation by the Supreme Court of Azerbaijan. \nAccording to the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Prosecutor's Office is defined as a part of the Judicial branch. Prosecutors Office exercises control over fulfilment and application of laws within the legal framework; in cases envisaged by law it undertakes prosecution and carries out investigation; supports state accusation in the court of law; proposes actions in the court of law; and appeals against decisions of the court of law.\nNakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\nThe Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic is autonomous state within the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nMunicipalities.\nLocal self-government in Azerbaijan is exercised by municipalities. Elections to municipalities and the status of municipalities are determined by the National Assembly of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Within the framework of the sovereignty of the Republic of Azerbaijan, municipalities are independent in exercising their powers. The state controls the implementation of the activities of municipalities. The municipalities submit the activity report to the National Assembly of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Municipalities are responsible to the citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\nEvery citizen of the Republic of Azerbaijan, who has the right to participate in elections and who permanently resides in the respective constituencies, may be elected as a member of the municipality. Elections to the municipality are held every 5 years.\nMunicipalities organize their work through meetings that are convened by the chairman of municipalities. The chairman is elected at the meetings of the municipality. In addition, the rules of the local government, the powers of its members, the local budget and its implementation, taxes and fees are approved at meetings, local programs of social security, social and economic development, and economic programs are adopted. In the municipalities of the Republic of Azerbaijan, decisions are taken by a majority of the members of the municipality.\nForeign relations.\nAzerbaijan is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO's Partnership for Peace, Euro-Atlantic Partnership, World Health Organization, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Council of Europe, CFE Treaty, the Community of Democracies, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank.\nTurkey (the first country to recognize Azerbaijan's independence) has been a staunch supporter of Azerbaijan in its efforts to consolidate its independence, preserve its territorial integrity and realize its economic potential arising from the rich natural resources of the Caspian Sea. The Turkish cultural close ties with Azerbaijan is summarized by the slogan \"One nation, two countries\".\nArmenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government; the two countries are still at war, a cease-fire has been in place since 1994 but the fire has been renewed on 27 September 2020. (\"See Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and Second Nagorno-Karabakh War\").\nAzerbaijan is one of the few countries with predominantly Muslim populations that shares a strategic alliance with Israel. Today, Israel is a major arms supplier to the country. (\"See Azerbaijan\u2013Israel relations\").\nAzerbaijan also maintains good relations with the European Union, in the framework of its Eastern European Neighbourhood Policy (\"See Azerbaijan\u2013European Union relations\").\nAzerbaijan was elected as one of the members of the newly established Human Rights Council (HRC) by the General Assembly on May 9, 2006. Term of office began on June 19, 2006. https://\nMilitary.\nThe Azerbaijan Armed Forces consists of four military branches: the army, navy, air force, and air defense forces.

The politics of the Bahamas takes place within a framework of parliamentary democracy, with a Prime Minister as the Head of Government. The Bahamas is an Independent Country and a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. As a former British colony, its political and legal traditions closely follow those of the United Kingdom. King Charles III is the head of state, but executive power is exercised by the cabinet. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of parliament. The Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and jurisprudence is based on English common law. \nThe multi-party system is dominated by the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement. The constitution protects freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association.\nPolitical developments.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the Bahamas was largely controlled by a group of influential white merchants known as the \"Bay Street Boys\", who dominated both the economy and the legislature. Executive power rested with the British Governor-in-Council.\nThe Progressive Liberal Party was formed in 1953 to represent the disenfranchised black majority and this led to the formation of the United Bahamian Party by the Bay Street Boys. In 1964, the British gave the Bahamas internal self-governance and the white UBP leader Roland Symonette became the country's first premier. In 1967, under the leadership of a young black lawyer named Lynden Pindling, the PLP were elected and went on to lead the Bahamas into independence in 1973.\nA coalition of PLP dissidents and former UBP members formed the Free National Movement (FNM) in 1971 under the leadership of Cecil Wallace-Whitfield. After Whitfield's death in 1990, another ex-PLP, Hubert Ingraham, became leader of the FNM and took the party to victory in the 1992 general election. The FNM was re-elected by a landslide in 1997, but lost to a resurgent PLP, under the leadership of his former law partner Perry Christie, in 2002. Ingraham turned the party leadership over to Tommy Turnquest in 2002, but in 2007, due partly to the Anna Nicole Smith scandal, he returned to lead the FNM to victory again by a five-seat margin.\nDue to the inefficiency of the Ingraham government, Christie's PLP regained the government in a massive landslide in 2012. The Christie government was once more libel to charges of massive corruption, and in 2017, there was an even bigger swing back to the FNM, leaving the PLP with a mere four seats in the parliament. general election|in 2002]], when the PLP returned to power under Perry Christie. Ingraham returned to power from 2007 to 2012, followed by Christie again from 2012 to 2017. With economic growth faltering, Bahamians re-elected the FNM in 2017, with Hubert Minnis becoming the fourth prime minister.\nIn September 2021, Prime Minister Hubert Minnis lost in a snap election as the economy struggles to recover from its deepest crash since at least 1971. Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) won 32 of the 39 seats in the House of Assembly. Free National Movement (FNM), led by Minnis, took the remaining seats. On 17 September 2021, the chairman of the Progressive Liberal Party (PLP) Phillip \u201cBrave\u201d Davis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Bahamas.\nExecutive branch.\nThe Bahamas is a constitutional monarchy based on the Westminster system of parliamentary government. King Charles III is the head of state as King of the Bahamas. He is viceregally represented by the Governor-General of the Bahamas who acts on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet.\nThe leader of the majority party in parliament serves as prime minister and head of government. The cabinet consists of at least nine members, including the prime minister and ministers of executive departments. They answer politically to the lower House of Assembly.\nThe governor-general appoints the chief justice of the Supreme Court on the advice of the prime minister and the leader of the opposition. Other justices are appointed on the advice of a judicial commission. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London serves as the highest appellate court for the Bahamas.\nLegislative branch.\nThe House of Assembly consists of 38 members, elected from individual constituencies for five-year terms. As under the Westminster system, the government may dissolve the parliament and call elections at any time. The House of Assembly performs all major legislative functions.\nThe Senate consists of 16 members appointed by the governor-general, including nine on the advice of the prime minister, four on the advice of the leader of the opposition, and three on the advice of the prime minister after consultation with the leader of the opposition.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Of these, approximately are paved. Drivers drive on the left. Golf carts are common in certain low traffic residential communities, resorts, and shopping areas away from main roads.\nThe Sustainable Nassau Action Plan published a report in 2022 suggesting the number of new cars on New Providence over course of the 2010s outpaced population growth, and urged officials to take measures to move away from car dependency and car-oriented development, and decrease congestion.\nPublic transport.\nBuses.\nPrivately operated licensed jitneys are the main mode of public transport and way to get around at a low cost, with rides ranging from $1 to 3. Bus stops typically contain a bench shaded by a yellow and white kiosk. Jitneys can be identified by the route and number displayed on the vehicle.\nIn 2017, the government launched a pilot programme to unify the different routes under one bus system among other improvements such as clearer signage and timetables.\nIn 2023, the Bahamas Unified Public Transportation Company (UPTC) and Bluestone Labs will roll out a unified ridesharing-style digital system. The new UPTC Jitney Pass, available through the Bluestone B-ID app, will cover over 40 routes, provide a routing system and live updates, and eventually phase out cash payments. UPTC president Harrison Moxey stated in February 2023 that the dispatch centre was near completion.\nTaxis and shuttles.\nFor those who do not own or rent a car, taxis with capped fares are available. Many hotels and resorts have their own shuttle services to the airport, beach (if they are not directly on a beach), and other destinations.\nWaterways.\nFerries.\nFerry and water taxi services are found throughout the Bahamas, particularly services that operate between New Providence and the Out Islands. Other ferries connect Downtown Nassau to Paradise Island; Great Abaco to its nearby cays; Acklins, Crooked Island and Long Cay; and South Bimini Airport to North Bimini's resort town.

The Lucayan Harbour Cruise Facility in Freeport and Nassau harbour's Prince George Wharf are built specifically to handle multiple modern cruise ships at one time. Additionally, several major cruise line corporations have each purchased an uninhabited island which they now operate as private island destinations available exclusively to their respective ships. These include Great Stirrup Cay, owned by Norwegian Cruise Line, Little Stirrup Cay otherwise known as Royal Caribbean International's \"Coco Cay\", Carnival Corporation's Little San Salvador Island or \"Half Moon Cay\", and Castaway Cay, of Disney Cruise Line.

However, there have been a few in the past including in Inagua, Abaco, and Grand Bahama used for the salt and logging industries. \nAt Wilson City, Abaco, a mill plant and adjacent town was developed by the Bahamas Timber Company at a cost of around $1 million, including building 12 miles of railway for logging. They operated three locomotives: a Vulcan 2-6-0, a Vulcan 0-4-4 tank, and a shay locomotive built at Lima Locomotive Works in Ohio. Along with the three locomotives, the company invested in almost 60 logging cars to carry the logs from the Forrest. Each train consisted of about 20 log cars. After Wilson City shut down at the end of World War I, Abaco was extensively logged by the Bahamas Cuban company until 1944, when they moved to Pineridge, Grand Bahama.\nThere were 5 camps on Abaco operated by the Bahamas Cuban Company. Norman\u2019s Castle, Millville, Cornwall 1 and 2, and Cross Harbour. They used 4 narrow gauge locomotives produced by the Climax locomotive works. At the last 4 camps, causeways were built so that the rail lines could reach the shore, over the vast expanses of swamp and mangroves. After the sinking of the Norwegian tanker O.A. Knudsen, the survivors were transported to the Cross harbour camp via locomotive so that they could receive medical attention. One sailor, Olaus Johansen, died and was buried at the camp. Once the operation moved and the site was abandoned, his grave was forgotten and was lost for many years.\nIn Inagua, the Morton salt company used small Brookville diesel locomotives to pull trains of salt around the area. The locomotives were phased out eventually, but the tracks remained for a few more years before being removed due to contamination issued with the salt.\nThere have been a handful of smaller railways that operated without locomotives, built for the purpose of transporting salt, sisal, and agricultural produce. These existed in Abaco, Exuma, Inagua (Inagua tramways, 1860s), and New Providence. In Abaco there were two short railways built, one at Cedar harbour and one at a plantation near a large blue hole on Little Abaco. \nOne of these were in Cat Island; the remnants of a short section of (now underwater) track can still be seen from the shore. The railroad was built in the 19th century to carry produce from Old Bight to a port where crops would be shipped to Europe and the US, and was closed when the US stopped foreign exports and plantations were no longer in use. The tracks were subsequently sent to the UK to be repurposed into scrap metal for weapons during World War II.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67651", "revid": "1319706468", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67651", "title": "Geography of Bahrain", "text": " \nThe Kingdom of Bahrain consists of Bahrain Island and 33 of the 37 Bahrain Islands, lying in the Persian Gulf's Gulf of Bahrain off the north shore of West Asia's Arabian Peninsula. Bahrain's capital city is Manama. The islands are about off the east coast of Saudi Arabia and from Qatar. The total area of the country is about , about four times the size of the District of Columbia.\nBahrain Island accounts for about 78% of the kingdom's land area, comprising . It is long from north to south and at its widest point stretches from east to west. The island is surrounded by several of the Middle East's large petroleum fields and commands a strategic position amid the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes.\nGeographical setting and islands.\nFollowing the return of Janan to Qatar in March 2001, the state of Bahrain consists of 33 natural islands in the Bahrain Islands archipelago.\nAround most of Bahrain is a relatively shallow inlet of the Persian Gulf known as the Gulf of Bahrain. The seabed adjacent to Bahrain is rocky and, mainly off the northern part of the island, covered by extensive coral reefs. Most of the island is a low-lying and barren desert. Outcroppings of limestone form low rolling hills, stubby cliffs, and shallow ravines. The limestone is covered by various densities of saline sand, capable of supporting only the hardiest desert vegetation \u2013 chiefly thorn trees and scrub. There is a fertile strip five kilometres wide along the northern coast on which date, almond, fig, and pomegranate trees grow. The interior contains an escarpment that rises to 134 meters, the highest point on the island, to form Jabal al Dukhan (Mountain of Smoke), named for the mists that often wreathe the summit. Most of the country's oil wells are situated in the vicinity of Jabal al Dukhan.\nOne author writes about the geology of the nation: \"Bahrein lies on a portion of the ancient Tethys Ocean geosynclinal belt represented today by the Persian Gulf. The formation of the principal island is the result of pressure from the mountain masses of Persia against the crystalline platform of central Asia, the thrust being absorbed by gentle folding in the geosynclines. The structure of Bahrein is that of a large, single, closed dome covering the entire faulting\".\nRocks exposed at the surface consist of:\nIn addition to Bahrain Island, other islands of significance include Nabih Saleh, which is northwest of Sitrah; Jidda Island and Umm as Sabaan, to the north of Umm a Nasan; and a group of islands, the largest of which is Hawar, near the coast of Qatar. Nabih Saleh contains several freshwater springs that are used to irrigate the island's the extensive date palm groves. The rocky islet of Jiddah formerly housed the state prison but has now been converted to a holiday resort. Hawar and the fifteen small islands near it are the subject of a territorial dispute between Bahrain and Qatar. Hawar is nineteen kilometres long and about one and one-half kilometres wide. The other islands (such as the Al Garum Islands) are uninhabited and are nesting sites for a variety of migratory birds.\nIn Bahrain forest cover is around 1% of the total land area, equivalent to 700 hectares (ha) of forest in 2020, up from 220 hectares (ha) in 1990. For the year 2015, 100% of the forest area was reported to be under public ownership.\nClimate.\nBahrain features an arid climate. Bahrain has two seasons: an extremely hot summer and a relatively mild winter. During the summer months, from April to October, afternoon temperatures average and can reach during May, June and July. The combination of intense heat and high humidity makes this season uncomfortable. In addition, a hot, dry southwest wind, known locally as the qaws, periodically blows sand clouds across the barren southern end of Bahrain toward Manama in the summer. Temperatures moderate in the winter months, from November to March, when the range is between . However, humidity often rises above 90% in the winter. From December to March, prevailing winds from the northwest, known as the shamal, bring damp air over the islands. Regardless of the season, daily temperatures are fairly uniform throughout the archipelago. Note that the coldest temperature ever recorded in Bahrain was on January 20, 1964, when it dropped to \u22125\u00a0\u00b0C (23\u00a0\u00b0F) in Awali and 2.7\u00a0\u00b0C (36\u00a0\u00b0F) at Bahrain International Airport.\nThat particular freeze was accompanied by a white-out, with icicles forming on trees and fences at Awali.\nBahrain receives little precipitation. The average annual rainfall is , usually confined to the winter months. No permanent rivers or streams exist on any of the islands. The winter rains tend to fall in brief, torrential downpours, flooding the shallow wadis that are dry the rest of the year and impeding transportation. Little of the rainwater is saved for irrigation or drinking. However, there are numerous natural springs in the northern part of Bahrain and on adjacent islands. Underground freshwater deposits also extend beneath the Persian Gulf to the Saudi Arabian coast. Since ancient times, these springs have attracted settlers to the archipelago. Despite increasing salinization, the springs remain an important source of drinking water for Bahrain. Since the early 1980s, however, desalination plants, which render seawater suitable for domestic and industrial use, have provided about 60% of daily water consumption needs.\nClimate change.\nDue to climate change Bahrain is experiencing more frequent extreme heat, drought, flooding and dust storms and the threat of sea level rise. These conditions threaten Bahrain's food and water security, and are expected to become more severe in the future. Despite being a relatively low-emitting country overall, Bahrain was the second highest greenhouse gas emitter per capita in 2023, at approximately 42 tonnes per person. Most of Bahrain's emissions arise from burning fossil fuels in the energy sector. The nation has committed to net zero by 2060 and also aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2035.\nArea and boundaries.\nArea:&lt;br&gt; total:780\u00a0km2\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 188\nArea comparative\nLand boundaries: 0\u00a0km\nCoastline: 161\u00a0km\nMaritime claims:\nElevation extremes:\nResources and land use.\nNatural resources: \nLand use:\nIrrigated land:\n40.15\u00a0km2 (2003)\nTotal renewable water resources:\n0.12 m\u00b3 (2011)\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\nEnvironmental concerns.\nNatural hazards: \n&lt;br&gt; periodic droughts; dust storms\nEnvironment \u2013 current issues:&lt;br&gt;\ndesertification resulting from the degradation of limited arable land, periods of drought, and dust storms; coastal degradation (damage to coastlines, coral reefs, and sea vegetation) resulting from oil spills and other discharges from large tankers, oil refineries, and distribution stations; lack of freshwater resources (groundwater and seawater are the only sources for all water needs)\nEnvironment \u2013 international agreements:&lt;br&gt;\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection, Wetlands\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Between 1976 and 2011 the number of baby births roughly doubled but the birth rate of babies decreased from 32 to 13 per 1,000. The death rate of Bahrain (1.9 per 1,000 human beings in 2011) is among the lowest in the world.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"template:sticky header/styles.css\"/&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Sort under/styles.css\" /&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nLife expectancy.\nSource: \"UN World Population Prospects\"\nEthnic groups.\nRegarding the ethnicity of Bahrainis, a \"Financial Times\" article published on 31 May 1983 found that \"Bahrain is a polyglot state, both religiously and racially. Discounting temporary immigrants of the past ten years, there are at least eight or nine communities on the island\". Furthermore, sources claim that the government of Bahrain is said to have naturalised Sunnis from different countries to increase the Sunni population in comparison to the \"Indigenous Shias\" including people from India, Pakistan, Jordan, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Egypt. These may be classified as:\nNon-nationals make up more than half of the population of Bahrain, with immigrants making up about 52.6% of the overall population. Of those, the vast majority come from South and Southeast Asia: according to various media reports and government statistics dated between 2005 and 2012 roughly 350,000 Indians, 150,000 Bangladeshis, 110,000 Pakistanis, 40,000 Filipinos, and 8,000 Indonesians. In 2023, about 4,000 people from the United Kingdom live in Bahrain, although some estimates are double this number.\nThe following is a firm containing estimates from countries' embassies:\nGenetics.\nAncient DNA and genetic history.\nA 2024 study sequenced whole genomes from four individuals who lived in Bahrain during the Tylos period (circa 300 BCE to 600 CE). The genetic makeup of these ancient Bahrainis revealed a blend of ancestries, primarily tracing back to ancient populations of the Near East. Analysis indicated that their genetic heritage is best described as a mixture of Ancient Anatolia, Levant, and Iran/Caucasus.\nSubtle genetic differences were observed among the four individuals, suggesting a degree of population diversity within Bahrain even before the Islamic era. One individual displayed a stronger affinity to Levantine populations, while others showed closer genetic links to groups from Iran and the Caucasus.\nComparing the ancient Bahraini genomes to those of modern populations revealed notable connections. Genetically, the Tylos-period individuals showed closer affinities to present-day inhabitants of Iraq and the Levant than to modern-day Arabians from the peninsula.\nMalaria adaptation.\nThe G6PD Mediterranean mutation, known to provide protection against malaria, was found in three out of the four ancient individuals. Genetic analysis suggests that this mutation began to increase in frequency in Eastern Arabia around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. This timeframe coincides with the emergence of agriculture in the region, which could have inadvertently created environments conducive to malaria-carrying mosquitoes, thus driving natural selection for malaria resistance.\nHaplogroups.\nY-chromosome DNA.\nY-Chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) represents the male lineage. In 2020, a study was made on 562 unrelated Bahraini males. Paternal population structure within Bahrain was investigated using the 27 Y-STRs (short tandem repeats) in the Yfiler Plus kit to generate haplotypes from 562 unrelated Bahraini males, sub-divided into four geographical regions\u2014Northern, Capital, Southern and Muharraq.\nHaplogroup prediction indicated diverse origins of the population with a predominance of haplogroups J2 and J1, but also haplogroups such as B2 and E1b1a likely originating in Africa, and H, L and R2 likely indicative of migration from South Asia. Haplogroup frequencies differed significantly between regions, with J2 significantly more common in the Northern region compared with the Southern, possibly due to differential settlement by Baharna, Ajams and Arabs.\nHaplogroup prediction suggests that haplogroup J2 is the most common in the Bahraini population (It is thought that J-M172 may have originated in the Caucasus, Anatolia or Western Iran) encompassing 27.6% of the sample, followed by J1 (23.0%), E1b1b (8.9%), E1b1a (8.6%) and R1a (8.4%), with other predicted haplogroups (G, T, L, R1b, Q, R2, B2, E2, H and C) occurring at progressively lower frequencies.\nHaplogroup J1 is most frequent in the Southern Governorate (27%) where the highest proportion of Arabs live, and in the Muharraq Governorate (27%) where many migrant Huwala Arabs resettled, and it declines to its lowest frequency in the Northern and Capital Governorates (21% and 19%).\nBy contrast, the Northern and Capital Governorates where the Baharna and Ajam are most represented show higher frequencies of haplogroup J2 (34% and 31%) than in Muharraq and the Southern Governorate (both 17%).\nReligion.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Pie chart/styles.css\"/&gt;\nIslam is the official religion forming 74% of the population. Current census data does not differentiate between the other religions in Bahrain, but in 2022, the country was approximately 12% Christian and had about 40 Jewish citizens.\nAccording to the website of Ministry of Information Affairs, 74% of the population are Muslim, with Christians being the second largest religious group, forming 10.2% of the population, Jews making up 0.21%. The percentage of local Bahraini Christians, Jews, Hindus and Baha'is is collectively 0.2%.\nBahraini citizens of Muslim faith belong to the Shi'a and Sunni branches of Islam. The last official census (1941) to include sectarian identification reported 52% (88,298 citizens) as Shia and\u00a048%\u00a0as\u00a0Sunni of the Muslim population. Unofficial sources, such as the Library of Congress Country Studies, and \"The New York Times\", estimate sectarian identification to be approximately 45% Sunni and 55% Shia. An official Bahraini document revealed that 51% of the country's citizens are Sunnis, while the Shiite population has declined to 49% of the Muslim population.\nForeigners, overwhelmingly from South Asia and other Arab countries, constituted 52.6% of the population in 2020. Of these, 50.9% are Muslim and 49.1% are non-Muslim, including Christians (primarily: Catholic, Protestant, Syriac Orthodox, and Mar Thoma from South India), Hindus, Buddhists, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and Sikhs.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The head of the government since 2020 is Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, who became Prime Minister following the death of Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, and who also serves as Deputy Commander of the Bahrain Defence Force. The parliament is a bicameral legislature, with the Council of Representatives elected by universal suffrage, and the Consultative Council (also called the Shura Council) appointed directly by the king.\nPolitical background.\nIsa bin Salman Al Khalifa.\nBahrain gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1971, with Sheikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa as its ruler. In 1972, Isa issued a decree for the election of a Constituent Assembly to draft and ratify a constitution. The electorate of the constituent assembly was native-born male citizens aged twenty years or older. The Constituent Assembly consisted of 22 elected delegates, plus the 12 members of the Council of Ministers and 8 members directly appointed by the Emir. All elected candidates ran as independents.\nThe draft constitution enshrined the hereditary leadership on the Al Khalifa family and provided for a unicameral legislature (the National Assembly) consisting of 44 members, 30 elected by native-born male citizens, plus 14 royally-appointed government ministers who were ex officio members. The constitution was enacted by decree in December 1973.\nA general election was also held in December 1973, the only election held under the 1973 Constitution. Two distinct political blocs formed amongst the 30 elected members. The \"People's Bloc\" consisted of eight Shia and Sunni members elected from urban areas and associated with left-wing and nationalist organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Bahrain, the National Liberation Front \u2013 Bahrain or the Baathist movement. The \"Religious Bloc\" was made up of six Shia members mostly from rural constituencies. The remaining members were independents with shifting positions. The National Assembly found itself without legislative powers, but closer to a public forum where petitions were heard and government legislation and policies were presented, debated and criticized, though elected members of the assembly sought to gain legislative powers. The government did not acquiesce and the Emir continued to issue laws by decree and in 1974 a proposed security law sparked a political crisis between certain members of the Assembly and the government. The security laws would have granted state authorities extraordinary powers to arrest and detain suspects deemed to threaten national security. A bloc formed within the National Assembly opposed to the security laws and the manner in which the government imposed the law. The crisis came to a head in August 1975 when Isa dissolved the National Assembly, and the country continued to be governed under emergency laws until 2002.\nFollowing the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran in 1981, the Bahraini Shia population orchestrated a failed coup attempt under the auspices of a front organisation, the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shia cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Isl\u0101m H\u0101d\u012b al-Mudarris\u012b, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners for running bare-legged during an international marathon. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.\nA popular uprising occurred between 1994 and 2000 in which leftists, liberals and Islamists joined forces. The event resulted in approximately forty deaths.\nHamad bin Isa Al Khalifa.\nThe repression ended after Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999. He instituted elections for parliament, gave women the right to vote, and released all political prisoners. A referendum on 14\u201315 February 2001 massively supported the National Action Charter, which was adopted on 14 February 2002.\nAn elected representative body was not reintroduced until the rule of Sheikh Isa's son, Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who succeeded as head of state in 1999, and initiated wide-ranging political reforms scrapping the restrictive state security laws, giving women the right to vote, freeing all political prisoners and holding parliamentary elections. The first poll was the 2002 Bahraini general election, with MPs serving four\u2011year terms; the second parliamentary election was the 2006 Bahraini general election.\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has been ruled by HM King Hamad bin Isa since 1999. The Al Khalifa family has ruled Bahrain since the late 1700s. The current ruler Hamad bin Isa became the Emir of Bahrain in 1999. In 2002, he declared Bahrain a kingdom and installed the king.\nThe reforms were based on the National Action Charter, a package of political changes that was endorsed by the people of Bahrain on 14 February 2001, in a popular referendum that saw a 98.4% vote in favour. Among other issues, the referendum paved the way for national elections and for the country to become a constitutional monarchy, changing the country's official name from the State of Bahrain to the Kingdom of Bahrain (a change which took effect in February 2002). Parliamentary elections took place on 26 October 2002 with the new legislature, the National Assembly, beginning work the following month.\nThe opposition led by Islamic parties boycotted the 2002 election in protest at the bicameral nature of the parliament, because the appointed upper chamber, the Shura Council, has the power to veto legislation. Shura members have responded by pointing out that an appointed upper chamber is a feature of long-established democracies such as the United Kingdom (where the upper chamber has the power to delay, but no power to veto legislation)\nand Canada.\nHowever, the principle behind the Al Wefaq's boycott, that only elected MPs should have the right to legislate, was undermined when, in response to proposed changes to the family law to give women more rights, Al Wefaq http:// that no one except religious leaders had the authority to amend the law because MPs could 'misinterpret the word of God.'\nDemocratisation has greatly enhanced clerical influence, through the ability of religious leaders to deliver the votes of their congregations to candidates. Sheikh Abdullah Al Ghraifi, the deputy head of the Islamic Scholars Council, gave a clear warning of the clerics' intent: \"We have at our disposition 150,000 votes that we will forward to the MPs, and I hope that they understand this message clearly.\" Over the showdown with the government and women's rights activists on the introduction of stronger legal rights for women, clerics have taken a lead in mobilising the opposition and threatened to instruct their supporters to vote against MPs that support women's rights.\nThe opening up of politics has seen big gains for both Sh\u012b\u00b4a and Sunn\u012b Islamic parties in elections, which has given them a parliamentary platform to pursue their policies. This has meant that what is termed \"morality issues\" have moved further up the political agenda with parties launching campaigns to impose bans on female mannequins displaying lingerie in shop windows, sorcery and the hanging of underwear on washing lines. Analysts of democratisation in the Middle East cite the Islamic parties' references to respect for human rights in their justification for these programmes as evidence that these groups can serve as a progressive force in the region.\nThe near-total dominance of religious parties in elections has given new prominence to clerics within the political system, with the most senior Shia religious leader, Sheikh Isa Qassim, playing an extremely important role. According to one academic paper, \"In fact, it seems that few decisions can be arrived at in Al Wefaq\u00a0\u2013 and in the whole country, for that matter\u00a0\u2013 without prior consultation with Isa Qassim, ranging from questions with regard to the planned codification of the personal status law to participate in elections\". In 2007, Al Wefaq-backed parliamentary investigations were credited with forcing the government to remove ministers who had frequently clashed with MPs: the Minister of Health, Dr Nada Haffadh and the Minister of Information, Dr Mohammed Abdul Gaffar.\nBahraini liberals have responded to the growing power of religious parties by organising themselves to campaign through civil society to defend basic personal freedoms from being legislated away. In November 2005, al Muntada, a grouping of liberal academics, launched \"We Have A Right\", a campaign to explain to the public why personal freedoms matter and why they need to be defended.\nBoth Sunn\u012b and Sh\u012b\u00b4a Islamic parties suffered a setback in March 2006 when twenty municipal councillors, most of whom represented religious parties, went missing in Bangkok on an unscheduled stopover when returning from a conference in Malaysia http:// . After the missing councillors eventually arrived in Bahrain they defended their Bangkok stay, telling journalists it was a \"fact-finding mission\", explaining: \"We benefited a lot from the trip to Thailand because we saw how they managed their transport, landscaping and roads.\"\nWomen's political rights in Bahrain saw an important step forward when women were granted the right to vote and stand in national elections for the first time in the 2002 election. However, no women were elected to office in that year's polls and instead Sh\u012b\u00b4a and Sunn\u012b Islamic parties dominated the election, collectively winning a majority of seats. In response to the failure of women candidates, six were appointed to the Shura Council, which also includes representatives of the Kingdom's indigenous Jewish and Christian communities. The country's first female cabinet minister was appointed in 2004 when Dr. Nada Haffadh became Minister of Health, while the quasi-governmental women's group, the Supreme Council for Women, trained female candidates to take part in the 2006 general election.\nThe King created the Supreme Judicial Council in 2000 to regulate the country's courts and institutionalize the separation of the administrative and judicial branches of government. The King is the head of the council.\nOn 11\u201312 November 2005, Bahrain hosted the Forum for the Future bringing together leaders from the Middle East and G8 countries to discuss political and economic reform in the region.\nShia and Sunni Islamic parties have both criticised the government over the composition of the appointed Shura Council, after it was given a strongly liberal majority, with Al Meethaq being the biggest group in the chamber. Critics allege that the government is seeking to use the Shura Council as a liberal bulwark to prevent clerical domination of politics.\nDominated by Islamic and tribal MPs, liberals have criticised the lower house for trying to impose a restrictive social agenda and curtailing freedoms. Those MPs who do not have an Islamic ideological agenda have been criticised for tending to approach politics not as a way of promoting principles, but as a means of securing government jobs and investment in their constituencies. The only voices that regularly speak in favour of human rights and democratic values in the lower house are the former communists of the Democratic Bloc and the secular Economists Bloc.\nAntigovernment factions state that the five municipal councils elected in 2002 do not have enough powers. Councillors of Islamic parties have repeatedly complained that their policies are being frustrated by lack of cooperation from central government. This has encouraged councillors to use at times innovative methods to push forward their policies. In January 2006, Dr Salah Al Jowler, an Asalah councillor in Muharraq discussed how the municipality would enforce a decree that would stipulate that all new buildings be fitted with one-way windows so that passersby would be unable to see residents within their homes (after concerns were raised about peeping toms). Dr Al Jowder explained that the municipalities would enforce the measure by using their control over the electricity supply: \"We can't stop someone from building if they do not promise to install one-way windows. But we can make them put in one-way windows if they want permission to install electricity.\" http:// \nIn October 2005, Al Wefaq and the former Maoist National Democratic Action agreed to register under the new Political Societies Law, but continue to object to it because it prevented parties from receiving foreign funding. The move has been widely seen as indicating that the two parties will take part in the 2006 general election, particularly as they have faced considerable pressure from party members to participate. Once the law took effect, Al Wefaq reversed its previous opposition and described it as a https://.\nTo revitalise the Left before the September 2006 general election, leading lawyer, Abdullah Hashem launched the National Justice Movement in March 2006. While Bahrain's liberals have sought to use the opening of civil society to campaign against the domination of Islamic parties in politics, with a campaign to protect personal freedoms, We Have A Right, led by the civic group, Al Muntada.\nBahrain's five governorates are administered by the Minister of State for Municipalities and the Environment in conjunction with each Governorate's Governor. A complex system of courts, based on diverse legal sources, including Sunni and Shi'a Sharia (religious law), tribal law, and other civil codes and regulation, was created with the help of British advisers in the early twentieth century. This judiciary administers the legal code and reviews laws to ensure their constitutionality.\nMajor protests occurred in 2011, coincident with protests in many other countries in the Arab world. The protesters selected 14 February as a day of protest to coincide with the 10th anniversary of the National Action Charter.\nNational security.\nExternal threats.\nThough juxtaposed between much larger neighbours, the tiny island Kingdom of Bahrain does not face any immediate threats from foreign nations. Likewise, it is not currently involved in any international disputes. In the recent past, however, relations between Bahrain and two other Persian Gulf states \u2013 Iran and Qatar \u2013 were less than amicable. The government of Bahrain has made a concerted effort to improve relations with both. Relations with Iran were initially strained over Bahrain's 1981 discovery of an Iranian-sponsored plot to stage a coup. Bahrain's suspicion that Iran had also instigated domestic political unrest in the 1990s fueled the tension. Bahrain's recent efforts to improve relations with Iran include encouraging trade between the respective nations, as well as promoting maritime security cooperation. Hostile relations between Bahrain and Qatar stemmed from a longstanding territorial dispute. On March 16, 2001, an International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling facilitated a peaceful settlement of the matter. The ICJ granted sovereignty over the Hawar Islands and Qit' at Jaradah to Bahrain and sovereignty over Zubarah (part of the Qatar Peninsula), Janan Island and Fasht ad Dibal to Qatar.\nInsurgencies.\nThe government of Bahrain does not face any immediate threats from individuals or organizations that seek to undermine its sovereignty. In the past, however, it has been forced to contend with political uprisings. The government foiled an attempted coup in 1981. The disaffection of Bahrain's Shi\u2019a majority precipitated a series of violent incidents in the 1990s. Legislative reforms aimed at addressing the estranged population's underlying grievances initially held the violence in check. In 1996 tensions resurfaced, however, and a number of hotel and restaurant bombings resulted in numerous casualties. The government subsequently arrested over 1,000 individuals for their alleged participation in the incidents and proceeded to hold them without trial.\nShaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa assumed the throne in March 1999 upon the death of his father, Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the ruler of Bahrain since 1961. He continued to implement democratic reforms, including the transformation of Bahrain from a hereditary emirate to a constitutional monarchy, and in so doing changed his status from emir to king. He also pardoned all political prisoners and detainees, including those who had been arrested for their unsubstantiated participation in the 1996 bombings as well as abolishing the State Security Law and the State Security Court, which had permitted the government to detain individuals without trial for up to 3 years.\nIn February 2011 a series of protests by the Shia majority began which became the Bahraini uprising.\nTerrorism.\nThe government of Bahrain has actively cooperated with the international community in general and the United States in particular to combat global terrorism. Basing and extensive overflight clearances that it has granted U.S. military aircraft contributed to the success of Operation Enduring Freedom. The government of Bahrain has cooperated closely on criminal investigations linked to terrorism. Likewise, it has taken steps to prevent terrorist organizations from using the nation's well-developed financial system. Not all of Bahrain's citizens have applauded their government's efforts, however, particular vis-\u00e0-vis its support for U.S. initiatives. Several anti-American demonstrations took place in 2002, during one of which the U.S. embassy was attacked with firebombs, and again at the onset of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003.\nIn 2005, Bahrain, as one of the six members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), agreed to intensify coordination in the fight against terrorism in response to instability in the region. They called for a clear definition of terrorism so that it could be differentiated from other criminal activities or activities such as rightful struggles against the foreign occupation for example.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As of 2024, the extraction of oil and natural gas is the third biggest sector in the economy. Bahrain advocates for a mixed economy system. The Bahraini Dinar is the second-highest-valued currency unit in the world. Since the late 20th century, Bahrain has heavily invested in the banking and tourism sectors. In 2008, Bahrain was named the world's fastest-growing financial center by the City of London's Global Financial Centres Index. Bahrain's banking and financial services sector, particularly Islamic banking, have benefited from the regional boom driven by demand for oil. Petroleum is Bahrain's most exported product, accounting for 60% of export receipts, 70% of government revenues, and 11% of GDP. Aluminum is the second most exported product, followed by finance and construction materials.\nAccording to the 2020 edition of the \"Index of Economic Freedom\", Bahrain has the fourth-freest economy in the Middle East and North Africa region and is the 40th-freest economy in the world. An alternative index places Bahrain at 70th place. Bahrain was recognised by the World Bank as a high income economy.\nEconomy overview.\nOil and natural gas play a dominant role in Bahrain\u2019s economy. Despite efforts to diversify the economy, according to the CIA World Fact Book, oil still comprises 85% of Bahraini budget revenues, meaning throughout the last few years, lower world energy prices have generated sizeable budget deficits - about 10% of GDP in 2017 alone. Bahrain's economy depends on oil and gas, international banking, and tourism.\nIn 2003 and 2004, the balance of payments improved due to rising oil prices and increased receipts from the services sector. As a result, the current account balance registered a surplus of US$219 million in 2003 and a surplus of US$442 million in 2004, compared to a deficit of US$35 million in 2002. Bahrain's gross international reserves increased substantially in 2004 to US$1.6 billion, up from US$1.4 billion in the previous three years (2001-2003).\nDiversification.\nThough http:// shrank by 2.4% in the 1980s, it bounced back to a growth of 36% in the 1990s as a result of successful diversification initiatives. Bahrain's urgency in embracing economic liberalisation is due to its need to diversify the economy away from its limited oil supplies. Unlike its Persian Gulf neighbours, Bahrain has little oil wealth, and the economy has expanded into banking, heavy industries, retail, and tourism. The Kingdom is the main banking hub for the Persian Gulf and a centre for Islamic finance, which has been attracted by the strong regulatory framework for the industry. According to the International Monetary Fund's Financial System Stability Assessment of Bahrain's financial regulatory environment, published on 6 March 2006, it found:\nIn 2005, Bahrain signed the US-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement, becoming the first Persian Gulf state to sign such a bilateral trade agreement with the United States. A massive privatization programme is underway to sell off key government assets: utilities, banks, financial services, and telecommunications have started to come under the control of the private sector.\nAs a result, the economy has been well-positioned to exploit the extra revenues generated in the region, thanks to the sustained high oil prices since 2002. In January 2006, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia cited Bahrain as the https:// in the Arab world.\nBetween 1981 and 1993, the Bahrain Government's expenditures increased by 64%. During that same time, government revenues continued to be largely dependent on the oil industry and increased by only 4%. Bahrain has at times received significant budgetary support and project grants from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.\nThe government has used its modest oil revenues to build an advanced infrastructure in transportation and telecommunications. Bahrain is a regional financial and business center. Tourism, especially from the region, has proved another significant source of income.\nBahrain has benefited from the oil boom since 2001, with economic growth of 5.5%. It has succeeded in attracting investment from other Persian Gulf states partly because it used the revenues of the 1970s-early 80s boom to invest in infrastructure development and other projects to improve the standard of living; health, education, housing, electricity, water, and roads all received attention.\nThe success of ventures such as the Bahrain Grand Prix has raised the Kingdom's international profile, and combined with the boom in Islamic banking, has encouraged major airlines to resume services to the country, with Lufthansa announcing on 14 March 2006 that it would schedule http:// .\nBahrain has initiated a series of labour reforms under Minister of Labour Majeed Al Alawi to bring the labour market into line with international standards. \nIn 2009, it was announced that the Bahraini Government would be developing land next door to the Bahrain International Circuit. The project being managed by @Bahrain is a mix of facilities including an exhibition and convention facility, a choice of hotel accommodations ranging from mid-market to luxury, a multi-purpose indoor arena, an automotive club and engineering facility, retail and leisure establishments, a tech-tainment (technology interacting with entertainment) centre, a research institute, a technology park and a focus on education and training. @Bahrain is part of the Mumtalakat group of companies and will dedicate more than 1 million square meters of business, entertainment and educational space with a value in excess of $2bn (BD 850 million), making it one of the largest investment projects to take place in Bahrain in the past five years.\nIn July 2023, Bahrain's national origin exports decreased by 23%, valued at BD323 million, while imports fell by 6% to BD441 million, resulting in a trade deficit of BD68 million, according to the Information &amp; eGovernment Authority (iGA) report.\nOverall during 2023, Bahrain's GDP grew by 2.45%, with the non-oil sector increasing by 4.48%.\nMacro-economic trend.\nThis is a chart of the trend of gross domestic product of Bahrain at market prices http:// by the International Monetary Fund, with figures in millions of Bahraini Dinars.\nFor purchasing power parity comparisons, the US Dollar is exchanged at 0.30 Bahraini Dinars only. Mean wages were $19.81 per man-hour in 2009.\nThe following table shows the main economic indicators from 1980\u20132024.\nHydrocarbon industry.\nPetroleum and natural gas are the only significant natural resources in Bahrain. Because of its limited reserves, Bahrain has worked to diversify its economy over the decade prior to 2004. Bahrain has stabilized its oil production at about 40,000 barrels (6,400 m\u00b3) per day, and reserves are expected to last 10 to 15 years. The Bahrain Petroleum Company refinery was built in 1935, has a capacity of about 250,000 barrels (40,000 m\u00b3) per day, and was the first in the Persian Gulf outside of Iran. After selling 60% of the refinery to the state-owned Bahrain National Oil Company in 1980, Caltex, a U.S. company, now owns 40%. Saudi Arabia provides most of the crude for refinery operations via pipeline. Bahrain also receives a large portion of the net output and revenues from Saudi Arabia's Abu Saafa offshore oilfield.\nThe Bahrain National Gas Company operates a gas liquefaction plant that utilizes gas piped directly from Bahrain's oilfields. Gas reserves should last about 50 years at present rates of consumption. The Gulf Petrochemical Industries Company (GPIC) is a joint venture of the petrochemical industries of Kuwait, the Saudi Basic Industries Corporation, and the Government of Bahrain. The plant, completed in 1985, produces ammonia, methanol and urea for export.\nBahrain's other industries include Aluminum Bahrain, which operates an aluminum smelter\u2014the largest in the world with an annual production of about 1,500,000 metric tons\u2014and related factories, such as the Aluminum Extrusion Company and the Gulf Aluminum Rolling Mill Company (GARMCO)http://. Other plants include the Arab Iron and Steel Company's iron ore pelletizing plant (4 million tons annually) and a shipbuilding and repair yard.\nInternational financial institutions operate in Bahrain, both offshore and onshore, without impediments. In 2001, Bahrain's central bank issued 15 new licenses. More than 100 offshore banking units and representative offices are located in Bahrain, as well as 65 American firms. Bahrain's international airport is one of the busiest in the Persian Gulf, serving 22 carriers. A port offers direct and frequent cargo shipping connections to the U.S., Europe, and the Far East. Notable Bahraini companies include Investcorp, a global investment firm founded in 1982 and headquartered in Manama, which has invested in various international brands such as Gucci.\nTaxation.\nTaxation and import laws apply equally to Bahraini and foreign-owned companies, and foreign investors must comply with the same requirements and legislation as local firms.\nOil and gas companies are taxed 46 percent on income derived from the sale of hydrocarbons and derivative products.\nThere is no personal income tax in Bahrain.\nEmployers and workers must pay social insurance contributions as follows:\n(1) for old-age, disability and survivor protection: for Bahraini employees, since May 2022, employers pay 14% of salary plus constant allowances, the percentage will rise by 1% each year (up to 20% in 2028), workers pay 7% plus constant allowances; for non-Bahraini employees, employers pay 3% of salary plus constant allowances (then being entitled only to employment injury benefits).\n(2) for unemployment insurance: since June 1, 2007, all wages are subject to a 2% tax, paid for equally by the employer and the employee, applicable both to nationals and non-citizens, and supplemented by a government contribution of 1%. This makes Bahrain the first of the GCC countries to implement a UI scheme.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67656", "revid": "44585572", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67656", "title": "Prunus", "text": "Genus of trees and shrubs\nPrunus is a genus of flowering trees and shrubs from the family Rosaceae. The genus includes plums, cherries, peaches, nectarines, apricots and almonds (collectively stonefruit). The genus has a cosmopolitan distribution, being native to the temperate regions of North America, the neotropics of South America, and temperate and tropical regions of Eurasia and Africa, There are about 340 accepted species as of \u00a02024[ [update]].\nMany members of the genus are widely cultivated for their sweet, fleshy fruit and for decorative purposes of their flowers. \"Prunus\" fruit are drupes, or stone fruits. The fleshy mesocarp surrounding the endocarp is edible while the endocarp itself forms a hard, inedible shell called the pyrena (\"stone\" or \"pit\"). This shell encloses the seed (or \"kernel\"), which is edible in some species (such as sweet almonds), but poisonous in many others (such as apricot kernels). Besides being eaten off the hand, most \"Prunus\" fruit are also commonly used in processing, such as jam production, canning, drying, and the seeds for roasting.\nDescription.\nMembers of the genus are either deciduous or evergreen. A few species have spiny stems. The leaves are simple, alternate, usually lanceolate, unlobed, and often with nectaries on the leaf stalk along with stipules. The flowers are usually white to pink, sometimes red, with five petals and five sepals. Numerous stamens are present. Flowers are borne singly, or in umbels of two to six or sometimes more on racemes. The fruit is a fleshy drupe (a \"prune\") with a single relatively large, hard-coated seed (a \"stone\").\nTaxonomy.\nWithin the rose family Rosaceae, it was traditionally placed as a subfamily, the Amygdaloideae (incorrectly \"Prunoideae\"), but was sometimes placed in its own family, the Prunaceae (or Amygdalaceae). More recently, \"Prunus\" is thought to have evolved from within a much larger clade now called subfamily Amygdaloideae (incorrectly \"Spiraeoideae\").\nClassification.\nEvolutionary history.\nThe oldest fossils confirmed to belong to \"Prunus\" date to the Eocene, and are found across the Northern Hemisphere. Older potential Late Cretaceous records are unconfirmed.\nThe earliest known fossil \"Prunus\" specimens are wood, drupe, seed, and a leaf from the middle Eocene of the Princeton Chert of British Columbia, Canada. Using the known age as calibration data, a partial phylogeny of some of the Rosaceae from a number of nucleotide sequences was reconstructed. \"Prunus\" and its sister clade Maloideae (apple subfamily) has been suggested to have diverged https://\u00a0million years ago which is within the Lutetian, or older middle Eocene. Stockey and Wehr report: \"The Eocene was a time of rapid evolution and diversification in Angiosperm families such as the Rosaceae ...\" The oldest fossil species is \"Prunus cathybrownae\" from the Klondike Mountain Formation.\nThe Princeton finds are among a large number of angiosperm fossils from the Okanagan Highlands dating to the late early and middle Eocene. \"Crataegus\" is found at three locations: the McAbee Fossil Beds, British Columbia; the Klondike Mountain Formation around Republic, Washington, and the Allenby Formation around Princeton, British Columbia, while \"Prunus\" is found at those locations plus the Coldwater Beds of Quilchena, British Columbia and Chu Chua Formation around Chu Chua, British Columbia. A review of research on the Eocene Okanagan Highlands reported that the Rosaceae were more diverse at higher altitudes. The Okanagan highlands formations date to as early as 52 mya, but the (approximate) 44.3 mya date might still apply. The authors state that \"the McAbee flora records a diverse early middle Eocene angiosperm-dominated forest.\"\nLinnean classification.\nIn 1737, Carl Linnaeus used four genera to include the species of modern \"Prunus\"\u2014\"Amygdalus, Cerasus, Prunus\", and \"Padus\"\u2014but simplified it to \"Amygdalus\" and \"Prunus\" in 1758. Since then, the various genera of Linnaeus and others have become subgenera and sections, as all the species clearly are more closely related. Liberty Hyde Bailey said: \"The numerous forms grade into each other so imperceptibly and inextricably that the genus cannot be readily broken up into species.\"\nTraditional classification.\nHistorical treatments break the genus into several different genera, but this segregation is not currently widely recognised other than at the subgeneric rank. The ITIS recognises just the single genus \"Prunus\", with an open list of species, all of which are given at List of Prunus species.\nOne treatment of the subgenera derives from the work of Alfred Rehder in 1940. Rehder hypothesized five subgenera: \"Amygdalus, Prunus, Cerasus, Padus\", and \"Laurocerasus\". To them C. Ingram added \"Lithocerasus\". The six subgenera are described as follows:\nPhylogenetic classification.\nAn extensive phylogenetic study based on different chloroplast and nuclear sequences divides \"Prunus\" into three subgenera:\nSpecies.\nThe lists below are incomplete, but include most more commonly cultivated species.\nAfro-Eurasian species.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSpecies found in the Americas.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEtymology.\nThe \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" presents the customary derivations of plum and prune from Latin \"pr\u016bnum\", the plum fruit. The tree is \"pr\u016bnus\"; and Pliny uses \"pr\u016bnus silvestris\" to mean the blackthorn. The word is not native Latin, but is a loan from Greek \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (), which is a variant of \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (), origin unknown. The tree is \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7 (). Most dictionaries follow Hoffman, \"Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen\", in making some form of the word a loan from a pre-Greek language of Asia Minor, related to Phrygian.\nThe first use of \"Prunus\" as a genus name was by Carl Linnaeus in \"Hortus Cliffortianus\" of 1737, which went on to become \"Species Plantarum\".\nPests and diseases.\nVarious \"Prunus\" species are winter hosts of the Damson-hop aphid, \"Phorodon humuli\", which is destructive to hops \"Humulus lupulus\" just at the time of their maturity, so plum trees should not be grown in the vicinity of hop fields.\nCorking is the drying or withering of fruit tissue. In stone fruit, it is often caused by a lack of boron and/or calcium.\nGummosis is a nonspecific condition of stone fruits (peach, nectarine, plum, and cherry) in which gum is exuded and deposited on the bark of trees. Gum is produced in response to any type of wound \u2013 insect, mechanical injury, or disease.\n\"Apiosporina morbosa\" is a major fungal disease in the Northern Americas, with many urban centres running black knot fungus management programs. This disease is best managed by physical removal of knot-bearing branches to prevent spore spread and immediate disposal of infected tissue. Chemical treatment is not largely effective, as trees can easily be re-infected by neighbouring knots.\n\"Laetiporus gilbertsoni\" (commonly sulfur shelf and chicken of the woods), is a serious cubic brown rot parasite which attacks certain species of decorative red-leaf plum trees in the genus \"Prunus\" on the Pacific coast of North America.\nCultivation.\nThe genus \"Prunus\" includes the almond, the nectarine and peach, several species of apricots, cherries, and plums, all of which have cultivars developed for commercial fruit and nut production. The almond is not a true nut; the edible part is the seed. Other species are occasionally cultivated or used for their seed and fruit.\nA number of species, hybrids, and cultivars are grown as ornamental plants, usually for their profusion of flowers, sometimes for ornamental foliage and shape, and occasionally for their bark.\nBecause of their considerable value as both food and ornamental plants, many \"Prunus\" species have been introduced to parts of the world to which they are not native, some becoming naturalised.\nThe Tree of 40 Fruit has 40 varieties grafted on to one rootstock.\nSpecies such as blackthorn (\"Prunus spinosa\"), are grown for hedging, game cover, and other utilitarian purposes.\nThe wood of some species (notably black cherry) is prized as a furniture and cabinetry timber, especially in North America.\nMany species produce an aromatic gum from wounds in the trunk; this is sometimes used medicinally. Other minor uses include dye production.\nPygeum, a herbal remedy containing extracts from the bark of \"Prunus africana\", is used as to alleviate some of the discomfort caused by inflammation in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\"Prunus\" species are food plants for the larvae of many Lepidoptera species (butterflies and moths).\n\"Prunus\" species are included in the Tasmanian Fire Service's list of low flammability plants, indicating that it is suitable for growing within a building protection zone.\nOrnamental \"Prunus\".\nOrnamentals include the group that may be collectively called \"flowering cherries\" (including \"sakura\", the Japanese flowering cherries).\nToxicity.\nMany species are cyanogenic; that is, they contain compounds called cyanogenic glucosides, notably amygdalin, which, on hydrolysis, yield hydrogen cyanide. Although the fruits of some may be edible by humans and livestock (in addition to the ubiquitous fructivory of birds), seeds, leaves and other parts may be toxic, some highly so. The plants contain no more than trace amounts of hydrogen cyanide, but on decomposition after crushing and exposure to air or on digestion, poisonous amounts may be generated. The trace amounts may give a characteristic taste (\"bitter almond\") with increasing bitterness in larger quantities, less tolerable to people than to birds, which habitually feed on specific fruits.\nBenefits to human health.\nPeople are often encouraged to consume many fruits because they are rich in a variety of nutrients and phytochemicals that are supposedly beneficial to human health. The fruits of \"Prunus\" often contain many phytochemicals and antioxidants. These compounds have properties that have been linked to preventing different diseases and disorders. Research suggests that the consumption of these fruits reduces the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, and other age-related declines. Many factors can affect the levels of bioactive compounds in the different fruits of the genus \"Prunus\", including the environment, season, processing methods, orchard operations, and postharvest management.\nCherries.\nCherries contain many different phenolic compounds and anthocyanins, which are indicators of being rich in antioxidants. Recent research has linked the phenolic compounds of the sweet cherry (\"Prunus avium\") with antitumor properties.\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) include superoxide radicals, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, and singlet oxygen; they are the byproducts of metabolism. High levels of ROS lead to oxidative stress, which causes damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The oxidative damage results in cell death, which ultimately leads to numerous diseases and disorders. Antioxidants act as a defense mechanism against the oxidative stress. They are used to remove the free radicals in a living system that are generated as ROS. Some of those antioxidants include glutathione S-transferase, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase. The antioxidants present in cherry extracts act as inhibitors of the free radicals. However, the DNA and proteins can be damaged when an imbalance occurs in the level of free radicals and the antioxidants. When not enough antioxidants are available to remove the free radicals, many diseases can occur, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson's disease, etc. Recent studies have shown that using natural antioxidants as a supplement in chemotherapy can decrease the amount of oxidative damage. Some of these natural antioxidants include vitamin C, tocopherol, and epigallocatechin gallate; they can be found in certain cherry extracts.\nAlmonds.\nSimilar to cherries, strawberries, and raspberries, almonds are also rich in phenolics. Almonds have a high oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC), which is another indicator of being rich in antioxidants. As stated before, high levels of free radicals are harmful, thus having the capacity to absorb those radicals is greatly beneficial. The bioactive compounds, polyphenols and anthocyanins, found in berries and cherries are also present in almonds. Almonds also contain nonflavonoid and flavonoid compounds, which contribute to their antioxidant properties. Flavonoids are a group of structurally related compounds that are arranged in a specific manner and can be found in all vascular plants on land. They also contribute to the antioxidant properties of almonds. Some of the nonflavonoid compounds present are protocatechuic, vanillic, and p-hydroxybenzoic acids. Flavonoid compounds that can be found in the skin of the almond are flavanols, dihydroflavonols, and flavanones.\nPlums.\nOf all of the different species of stone fruits, plums are the richest in antioxidants and phenolic compounds. The total antioxidant capacity (TAC) varies within each fruit, but in plums, TAC is much higher in the skin than in the flesh of the fruit.\nApricots.\nApricots are high in carotenoids, which play a key role in light absorption during development. Carotenoids are the pigments that give the pulp and peel of apricots and other \"Prunus\" fruits their yellow and orange colors. Moreover, it is an essential precursor for vitamin A, which is especially important for vision and the immune system in humans. Moreover, these fruits are quite rich in phenolic substances, including catechin, epicatechin, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, and ferulic acid.\nPeaches and nectarines.\nSimilar to the plum, peaches and nectarines also have higher TAC in the skin than in the flesh. They also contain moderate levels of carotenoids and ascorbic acid. Peaches and nectarines are orange and yellow in color, which can be attributed to the carotenoids present.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Due to massive budgetary deficits and low oil prices, the Bahraini government increased the price of gasoline in 2016\u20132017 to $0.37 per litre.\nRoad transport.\nThe widening of roads in the old districts of Manama and the development of a national network linking the capital to other settlements commenced as early as the arrival of the first car in 1914. Due to the continuous increase in the number of cars, a series of ring roads were constructed in Bahrain, notably Isa Al Kabeer Avenue in the 1930s, Exhibition Avenue in the 1960s and Al Fateh Highway in the 1980s. To the north, the foreshore used to be around \"Government Avenue\" in the 1920s but it shifted to a new road, \"King Faisal Road\", in the early 1930s which became the coastal road. To the east, a bridge connected Manama to Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden bridge. Vehicle movement between the two islands peaked after the construction of the Bahrain International Airport in 1932.\nTo the south of Manama, roads connected groves, lagoons and marshes of Hoora, Adliya, Gudaibiya and Juffair. Villages such as Mahooz, Ghuraifa, Seqaya served as the end of these roads. To the west, a major growth in the number of vehicle ma from 3,379 in 1954 and to 18,372 cars in 1970 caused urban development to primarily focus on expanding the road network, widening carriageways and the establishment of more parking spaces. Many tracks previously laid in the pre-oil era (prior to the 1930s) were resurfaced and widened, turning them into 'road arteries'. Initial widening of the roads started in the Manama Souq district, widening its main roads by demolishing encroaching houses.A highway was built that linked Manama to the isolated village port of Budaiya, this highway crossed through the 'green belt' villages of Sanabis, Jidhafs and Duraz. To the south, a road was built that connected Manama to Riffa. The discovery of oil accelerated the growth of the city's road network.\nThe four main islands and all the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads. There were of roadways as of 2010[ [update]], of which were paved. Multiple causeways stretching over , connect Manama with Muharraq Island, and the Sitra Causeway joins Sitra to the main island. A four-lane highway atop a causeway, linking Bahrain with the Saudi Arabian mainland via the island of Umm an-Nasan was completed in December, 1986, and financed by Saudi Arabia.\nPrivate vehicles and taxis are the primary means of transportation in the city.\nBahrain changed from driving on the left to driving on the right in November 1967.\nRailways.\nAs of 2025, there were no railways in Bahrain, but plans were developing for a railway system connecting all the countries in the Persian Gulf and for a light rail network within Bahrain. A subway system has also been proposed. In August 2018, \"Al-Ayam\" reported that transportation officials in Bahrain were looking for \"bids to fund a new metro railway system in the fourth quarter of 2019.\" There were plans for the rail to be international, connecting to local railway systems in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. According to Ehsan Bayat, Bahrain's system will contribute to the network. The project is to be completed in four phases over four years and cost $1\u20132 billion, as a joint venture between the public and private sector. It will be a railway system, and the first in Bahrain. It will be called the GCC Railway, linking all six Gulf States. Along with private funders, it will be funded by the Ministry of Transportation in KSA and King Fahad Causeway Authority.\nAirports.\nBahrain has four airports, all of which have paved runways. One airport is civil (Bahrain International Airport) and three are military (Isa Air Base, Sakhir Air Base, and Riffa Air Base).\nPorts and harbors.\nBahrain has five recognised harbors in Manama, Mina Salman, Sitrah, Muharraq, and the Khalifa bin Salman port in Hidd. The port of Mina Salman can accommodate 16 oceangoing vessels drawing up to .\nOn 6 November 2025, Bahrain and Qatar launched a passenger ferry service connecting Sa'ada Marina on Muharraq island in Bahrain to the northern Qatari port of Al Ruwais. Operated by the Masar group, a subsidiary of Bahrain's sovereign wealth fund Mumtalakat, the 70-minute route is expected to initially run twice a day before increasing services to three times a day. \nMerchant marine.\nSince 2014, Bahrain has sought to promote itself as an open register. As of 2020, there were 234 ships in Bahrain's merchant marine, of which 11 were general cargo ships, four were oil tankers, and 219 were other types of ships.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

All the member states are determined to work with her and to support her, and I think she's going to bring a new dimension to the work here.\" The move follows a series of appointments of women to high-profile positions in the Kingdom (see Women's political rights in Bahrain for further details).\nDuring the Persian Gulf War in 1990\u201391, Bahrain was part of the coalition that fought to liberate Kuwait. Bahraini, RAF, and USAF pilots flew air strikes in Iraq from the Sheik Isa Air Base, while coalition navies operated out of Manama, the capital. Bahrain was hit by Scud missiles fired from Iraq. A number of Bahraini students studying in Iraq and Kuwait at the outbreak of hostilities went missing and are presumed the victims of Saddam Hussein's secret police.\nAfter the liberation of Kuwait, Bahrain and the United States strengthened their already good ties by signing a ten-year agreement in October 1991, which granted American forces access to Bahraini facilities and allowed the U.S. to pre-position war material for future crises. In July 1995 the U.S. 5th Fleet was established in the Persian Gulf with its headquarters at NSA Bahrain in Manama. In 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush designated Bahrain as a major non-NATO ally.\nBahrain was an active member of the coalition that fought to remove the Taliban regime from Afghanistan in 2001; the Kingdom provided ships for the naval cordon in the Indian Ocean put in place to intercept fleeing Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.\nHowever, the Kingdom opposed unilateral action against Iraq in 2003, and to the annoyance of Washington in the run up to the war sought to defuse the crisis by offering Saddam Hussein asylum as a way of avoiding war.\nBahrain-Iran relations have been strained since the Iranian Revolution and the 1981 discovery of a planned Iran-sponsored coup in Bahrain. Bahraini suspicions of the Iranian role in local unrest in the mid-1990s remain. However, with the decline of Iraq as a regional powerbroker, Bahrain has begun taking steps to improve relations with Iran and increase regional harmony. These efforts have included encouraging Bahrain-Iran trade.\nThe long-standing territorial dispute with Qatar over the Hawar Islands and the maritime boundary were resolved in 2001 by a compromise decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).\nTo mark Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October 2007, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs co-sponsored with the Bahrain Centre for Studies and Research and the Indian Embassy a conference on the relevance of Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s philosophy for the Arab world in the 21st Century. The conference, attended by Arab and Indian academics, UN officials and diplomats discussed the Gandhi\u2019s teaching of non-violence, austerity and spiritualism with particular reference to the Arab world today. Among the keynote speakers was leading liberal academic, Dr Abdulla Al Madani, who emphasised Gandhi\u2019s moral vision: \"Had he resorted to kidnapping, suicide-bombings, beheadings, or other barbarian means, his memory would not have remained rooted in the world's conscience. Believing that the credibility of one's action lay in setting a personal example, Gandhi began with himself. He quit his legal practice, gave up wearing Western-style clothing, and embraced a humble lifestyle by making his own clothes and living on a simple vegetarian diet. This, of course, differs from the practice of leaders of some Arab resistance movements, who urge their followers to boycott the West while savouring the Western lifestyle, products, and technology.\"\nRelations with Thailand and the Hakeem al-Araibi incident.\nBahrain's foreign relations were put under strain and its human rights record under the spotlight when in November 2018 Bahraini footballer Hakeem al-Araibi, who had been sentenced in absentia by Bahrain to 10 years in prison for vandalising a police station in 2013, was arrested upon arrival in Thailand with his wife for their honeymoon. The footballer, who had been granted refugee status by Australia in 2014, urged the Thailand authorities not to deport him to Bahrain as he had been previously tortured in Bahrain for his political views.\nHe was kept in detention in Thailand while the Australian government and many international organisations and individuals lobbied for his release, until it was announced on 11 February 2019 by the Thai Office of the Attorney-General (OAG) that the extradition case against al-Araibi had been dropped by the criminal court at Bahrain's request. No reason was given by the foreign ministry, but the decision was made under Section 21 of the Prosecution Act, which allows for cases to be dropped if not in the public interest, and he would be released and allowed to return to Australia as soon as possible.\nDuring the media frenzy surrounding the case, the strong links between Bahrain and Thailand were alluded to in the press. \nAcademics and human rights groups raised the issue of the very close ties between the two countries, both financially and between the two royal families. According to Dr Aim Sinpeng, an expert in South-East Asian politics at the University of Sydney, the Thai and Bahraini royal families have always had a close relationship and the Bahraini royal family visits Thailand every year. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Surapong Tovichakchaikul said in 2012 that the relationship between Thailand and Bahrain \u201cwas very close and strong\u201d and also disclosed that the Bahrain Prime Minister was a \u201cclose personal friend\u201d of former Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and had \u201cdonated roughly $2 million of his own money\u201d to Thailand for flood relief.\nThe latest new business venture between the two countries is a new 6,700 sq. m. Thai shopping centre in Manama, set to launch in the first half of 2019 and described as an opportunity for Thai small and medium-sized enterprises to reach a huge potential market of Saudi shoppers, said to be the biggest economic centre in Bahrain, with import and exports between the two countries expected to be worth around US$400m annually.\nDiplomatic relations.\nList of countries which Bahrain maintains diplomatic relations with:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67668", "revid": "48736052", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67668", "title": "Deimos (moon)", "text": "Smallest and outer moon of Mars\nDeimos () is the smaller and outer of the two natural satellites of Mars, the other being Phobos. Deimos has a mean radius of and takes 30.3\u00a0hours to orbit Mars. Deimos is from Mars, much farther than Mars's other moon, Phobos. It is named after Deimos, the Ancient Greek god and personification of dread and terror.\nDiscovery and etymology.\nDeimos was discovered by Asaph Hall at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., on 12 August 1877, at about 07:48 UTC. Hall, who also discovered Phobos shortly afterwards, had been specifically searching for Martian moons at the time.\nThe moon is named after Deimos, a figure representing dread in Greek mythology. The name was suggested by academic Henry Madan, who drew from Book XV of the \"Iliad\", where Ares (Greek counterpart of the Roman god Mars) summons Dread (Deimos) and Fear (Phobos).\nPlanetary moons other than Earth's were never given symbols in the astronomical literature. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer who designed most of the dwarf planet symbols, proposed a Greek delta (the initial of Deimos) combined with Mars's spear as the symbol of Deimos (). This symbol is not widely used.\nOrigin.\nThe origin of Mars's moons is unknown and the hypotheses are controversial. The main hypotheses are that they formed either by capture or by accretion.\nBecause of the postulated similarity to the composition of C- or D-type asteroids, one hypothesis is that the moons may be objects captured into Martian orbit from the asteroid belt, with orbits that have been circularized either by atmospheric drag or tidal forces, as capture requires dissipation of energy. The current Martian atmosphere is too thin to capture a Phobos-sized object by atmospheric braking. Geoffrey Landis has pointed out that the capture could have occurred if the original body was a binary asteroid that separated due to tidal forces. The main alternative hypothesis is that the moons accreted in the present position. Another hypothesis is that Mars was once surrounded by many Phobos- and Deimos-sized bodies, perhaps ejected into orbit around it by a collision with a planetesimal.\nIn 2021, Amirhossein Bagheri (ETH Zurich), Amir Khan (ETH Zurich), Michael Efroimsky (US Naval Observatory) and their colleagues proposed a new hypothesis on the origin of the moons. By analyzing the seismic and orbital data from the Mars InSight Mission and other missions, they proposed that the moons were born from the disruption of a common parent body around 1 to 2.7 billion years ago. The common progenitor of Phobos and Deimos was most probably hit by another object and shattered to form Phobos and Deimos.\nPhysical characteristics.\nDeimos is a gray-colored body. Like most bodies of its size, Deimos is highly non-spherical with triaxial dimensions of , corresponding to a mean diameter of which makes it about 57% the size of Phobos. Deimos is composed of rock rich in carbonaceous material, much like C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. It is cratered, but the surface is noticeably smoother than that of Phobos, caused by the partial filling of craters with regolith. The regolith is highly porous and has a radar-estimated density of only .\nEscape velocity from Deimos is 5.6\u00a0m/s. This velocity could theoretically be achieved by a human performing a vertical jump. The apparent magnitude of Deimos is 12.45.\nNamed geological features.\nOnly two geological features on Deimos have been given names. The craters Swift and Voltaire are named after writers who speculated on the existence of two Martian moons before Phobos and Deimos were discovered.DEIMOS\nDeimos Crater Names ( \u2022 )\nOrbital characteristics.\nDeimos's orbit is nearly circular and is close to Mars's equatorial plane. Deimos is possibly an asteroid that was perturbed by Jupiter into an orbit that allowed it to be captured by Mars, though this hypothesis is still controversial and disputed. Both Deimos and Phobos have very circular orbits which lie almost exactly in Mars's equatorial plane, and hence a capture origin requires a mechanism for circularizing the initially highly eccentric orbit, and adjusting its inclination into the equatorial plane, most likely by a combination of atmospheric drag and tidal forces; it is not clear that sufficient time was available for this to have occurred for Deimos.\nAs seen from Mars, Deimos would have an angular diameter of no more than 2.5 minutes (sixty minutes make one degree), one twelfth of the width of the Moon as seen from Earth, and would therefore appear almost star-like to the naked eye. At its brightest (\"full moon\") it would be about as bright as Venus is from Earth; at the first- or third-quarter phase it would be about as bright as Vega. With a small telescope, a Martian observer could see Deimos's phases, which take 1.2648 days (Deimos's synodic period) to run their course.\nUnlike Phobos, which orbits so fast that it rises in the west and sets in the east, Deimos rises in the east and sets in the west, slower than Mars's rotation speed. The Sun-synodic orbital period of Deimos of about 30.4 hours exceeds the Martian solar day (\"sol\") of about 24.7 hours by such a small amount that 2.48 days (2.41 sols) elapse between its rising and setting for an equatorial observer. From Deimos-rise to Deimos-rise (or setting to setting), 5.466 days (5.320 sols) elapse.\nBecause Deimos's orbit is relatively close to Mars and has only a very small inclination to Mars's equator, it cannot be seen from Martian latitudes greater than 82.7\u00b0.\nDeimos's orbit is slowly getting larger, because it is far enough away from Mars and because of tidal acceleration. It is expected to eventually escape Mars's gravity.\nSolar transits.\nDeimos regularly passes in front of the Sun as seen from Mars. It is too small to cause a total eclipse, appearing only as a small black dot moving across the Sun. Its angular diameter is only about 2.5 times the angular diameter of Venus during a transit of Venus from Earth. On 4 March 2004 a transit of Deimos was photographed by Mars rover \"Opportunity\", and on 13 March 2004 a transit was photographed by Mars rover \"Spirit\".\nExploration.\nOverall, its exploration history is similar to those of Mars and of Phobos. Deimos has been photographed close-up by several spacecraft whose primary mission has been to photograph Mars, including in March 2023 during a rare close encounter by the Emirates Mars Mission. No landings on Deimos have been made.\nIn 1997 and 1998, the proposed \"Aladdin\" mission was selected as a finalist in the NASA Discovery Program. The plan was to visit both Phobos and Deimos, and launch projectiles at the satellites. The probe would collect the ejecta as it performed a slow flyby (~1\u00a0km/s). These samples would be returned to Earth for study three years later. The principal investigator was Carle M. Pieters of Brown University. The total mission cost, including launch vehicle and operations was $247.7 million. Ultimately, the mission chosen to fly was \"MESSENGER\", a probe to the planet Mercury.\nIn 2008, NASA Glenn Research Center began studying a Phobos and Deimos sample-return mission that would use solar electric propulsion. The study gave rise to the \"Hall\" mission concept, a New Frontiers-class mission currently under further study.\nAlso, the sample-return mission called \"Gulliver\" has been conceptualized and dedicated to Deimos, in which 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of material from Deimos would be returned to Earth.\nAnother concept of sample-return mission from Phobos and Deimos is \"OSIRIS-REx\u00a02\", which would use heritage from the first \"OSIRIS-REx\".\nIn March 2014, a Discovery class mission was proposed to place an orbiter in Mars orbit by 2021 and study Phobos and Deimos. It was called \"Phobos And Deimos &amp; Mars Environment\" (PADME).\nHuman exploration of Deimos could serve as a catalyst for the human exploration of Mars. Recently, it was proposed that the sands of Deimos or Phobos could serve as a valuable material for aerobraking in the colonization of Mars. See Phobos for more detail.\nISRO's Mars Orbiter Mission captured the first pictures of the far side on Deimos.\nIn April 2023, astronomers released close-up global images, for the first time, of Deimos that were taken by the Mars Hope orbiter. Observations reported by this mission contravene the captured asteroid hypothesis and indicate basaltic planetary origin of Deimos.\nDuring its gravity assist from Mars en route to 65803 Didymos, the ESA's \"Hera\" took observations of Deimos in March 2025, approaching at a distance of 300 km (190 mi).\nThe JAXA MMX Mission to Phobos and Deimos is planned for launch in October 2026. It will make flybys of Deimos to investigate its composition and structure, as well as performing a sample return on Phobos and placing a rover on that moon.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67670", "revid": "12668557", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67670", "title": "Politics of Sweden", "text": " \nThe politics of Sweden take place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic constitutional monarchy. Executive power is exercised by the government, led by the Prime Minister. Legislative power is vested in both the government and parliament, elected within a multi-party system. The judiciary is independent, appointed by the government and employed until retirement. Sweden is formally a monarchy with a monarch holding symbolic power.\nSweden has a typical Western European history of democracy, beginning with the old Viking age Ting electing kings, evolving into a hereditary royal power in the 16th century, that in periods became more or less democratic depending on the general European trends. The current democratic regime is a product of a stable development of successively added democratic institutions introduced during the 19th century up to 1921, when women's suffrage was introduced. The Government of Sweden has adhered to parliamentarism \u2014 \"de jure\" since 1975, \"de facto\" since 1917.\nSince the Great Depression, Swedish national politics has largely been dominated by the Social Democratic Workers' Party, which has held a plurality (and sometimes a majority) in the Swedish parliament since 1917. General elections are held every four years. \nThe Economist Intelligence Unit rated Sweden a \"full democracy\" in its report for 2020. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices Sweden was 2023 the third most electoral democratic country in the world. According to Freedom House Sweden scored 40/40 for protection of political rights in 2020.\nConstitution.\nThe Constitution of Sweden consists of four fundamental laws. The most important is the Instrument of Government of 1974 which sets out the basic principles of political life in Sweden, defining rights and freedoms. The Act of Succession is a treaty between the old Riksdag of the Estates and House of Bernadotte regulating their rights to accede to the Swedish throne. The constitution differs from most other Western countries in aspects such as having a unicameral parliament, limited municipal autonomy, and the lack of a supreme court with power to overturn acts of the legislature. Instead of checks and balances the executive power is entrusted to the politicians.\nThe four fundamental laws are:\nMonarchy.\nA hereditary monarch, currently King Carl XVI Gustaf of the House of Bernadotte serves as head of state since 1973. His authority is formal, symbolic, and representational. \nHeiress apparent to the throne is Crown Princess Victoria since 1980.\nExecutive branch.\nHead of government.\nThe prime minister of Sweden is nominated by the speaker of the Riksdag and elected through negative parliamentarism. In practice, this means that the prime minister nominee is confirmed if fewer than 175 members of parliament vote 'no', regardless of the number of 'yes' votes or abstentions.\nFollowing a lengthy government formation process as a result of the general election held on 9 September 2018, Stefan L\u00f6fven of the Swedish Social Democratic Party was re-elected prime minister of Sweden for a second term by the new parliament on 18 January 2019, after initially being ousted by parliament. Together with the Green Party, L\u00f6fven presided over a minority government which relied on confidence and supply from the Centre Party and Liberals.\nThe deputy prime minister was Isabella L\u00f6vin of the Green Party. \nIn August 2021, Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven announced his resignation and Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson was elected as the new head of Sweden's ruling Social Democrats in November 2021. On 30 November 2021, Magdalena Andersson became Sweden's first female prime minister. She formed a minority government made up of only her Social Democrats. Her plan for forming a new coalition government with the Green Party was unsuccessful because her budget proposal failed to pass.\nOn 18 October 2022, Ulf Kristersson of the Moderate Party became the new prime minister of Sweden. Kristersson's Moderates formed a centre-right coalition with the Christian Democrats and the Liberals. The new government is backed by the biggest right-wing party, Sweden Democrats (SD) led by Jimmie \u00c5kesson, with tougher immigration policies being a crucial part of a policy deal with the SD.\nGovernment.\nThe highest executive authority of the state is vested in the government, which consists of a prime minister and roughly 22 ministers who head the ministries.\nThe ministers are appointed at the sole discretion of the prime minister. The prime minister is nominated by the speaker and appointed following a vote in the Riksdag itself. The monarch plays no part in this process. The only way to oust a government is through a motion of no confidence (\"misstroendevotum\") in the Riksdag. This motion must get a majority of the total number of votes in the Riksdag (at least 175). Another example of the power the legislature has given the government is the adoption of the budget in the Riksdag. The government's proposition to budget is adopted, unless a majority of the members of the Riksdag vote against it. This is to make it possible to govern even in minority.\nThe main functions of the government are to:\nLegislative branch.\nThe unicameral Riksdag has 349 members, popularly elected every four years. It is in session generally from September through mid-June.\nLegislation may be initiated by the Cabinet or by members of the Riksdag. Members are elected on the basis of proportional representation for a four-year term. The Riksdag can alter the Constitution of Sweden, but only with approval by a supermajority and confirmation after the following general elections.\nThe Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading political role since 1917, after Reformists confirmed their strength and the revolutionaries left the party. After 1932, the Cabinets have been dominated by the Social Democrats. Only six general elections (1976, 1979, 1991, 2006, 2010 and 2022) have given the centre-right bloc enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government. This is considered one reason for the Swedish post-war welfare state, with a government expenditure of slightly more than 50% of the gross domestic product.\nPolitical parties and elections.\nA general election is held alongside local and regional elections every four years. The last election was held on 11 September 2022.\nJudiciary.\nSwedish law, drawing on Germanic, Roman, and Anglo-American law, is neither as codified as in France and other countries influenced by the Napoleonic Code, nor as dependent on judicial practice and precedents as in the United States.\nGovernment agencies.\nGovernment policy is carried out by the administrative authorities (\"f\u00f6rvaltningsmyndigheter\") and government agencies of Sweden. These bodies are state-controlled and are formally headed by government-appointed directors-general but act independently from the executive and legislative branches of government. Ministerial governance (\"ministerstyre\") is illegal; in accordance with 2 \u00a7, chapter 12 of the Instrument of Government, no member of the Riksdag or government may interfere in the day-to-day operation of an agency, nor in the outcome of individual cases.\nPoliticians.\nSweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its \"popular movements\" (\"folkr\u00f6relser\"), the most notable being trade unions, the women's movement, the temperance movement, and \u2013 more recently \u2013 sports movement. Election turnout in Sweden has always been high in international comparisons, although it has declined in recent decades, and is around 87%, (87.18% in the general election of 2018).\nSome Swedish political figures that have become known worldwide include Joe Hill, Carl Skoglund, Raoul Wallenberg, Folke Bernadotte, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld, Olof Palme, Carl Bildt, Hans Blix, and Anna Lindh.\nAccording to a survey investigation by the sociologist Jenny Hansson, Swedish national parliamentarians have an average work week of 66 hours, including side responsibilities. Hansson's investigation further reports that the average Swedish national parliamentarian sleeps 6.5 hours per night.\nAdministrative divisions.\nSweden is divided into 21 counties. In each county there is a county administrative board and a county council. Each county contains several municipalities, in total 290. Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. The king, the Riksdag and the government have their permanent seat in Stockholm. Up to 1968 when the Overgovernor's Office was incorporated into Stockholm County, it had a special status. \nAs of the 1974 constitutional revision, the number of municipal divisions was reduced from several thousand to 290, while also removing previous functions of the municipal governments (such as local laws, local law enforcement, and more).\nEnergy politics.\nAfter the 1973 oil crisis, the energy politics were determined to become less dependent on the import of petroleum. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. Sweden wants to be independent of petroleum use by 2020. The Three Mile Island accident (United States) prompted the Swedish parliament in 1980 after a referendum to decide that no further nuclear power plants should be built and that a nuclear power phase-out should be completed by 2010. Following the recommendation of the 1980 referendum, two nuclear power reactors were closed by government decision in 1999 and 2005, respectively. However, in February 2009, the Swedish centre-right wing government announced that new nuclear power stations may be constructed if they replace old ones, thus ending the previous de facto phase out policy.\nAs of 2005[ [update]], the use of renewables amounted to 26% of the energy supply in Sweden, most important being hydropower and biomass. In 2003, electricity from hydropower accounted for 53 TWh and 40% of the country's production of electricity with nuclear power delivering 65 TWh (49%). At the same time, the use of biofuels, peat etc. produced 13 TWh of electricity. Sweden was the highest ranked country in the Climate Change Performance Index until 2022, when it was displaced by Denmark.\nIn March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power. Since then however, reports about radioactive leakages at a nuclear waste store in Forsmark, Sweden, have been published. This does not seem to have changed the public support of continued use of nuclear power.\nForeign relations.\nThroughout the 20th century, Swedish foreign policy was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime, neutrality in wartime. This principle has often been criticised in Sweden, allegedly being a facade, claiming that the Swedish government had an advanced collaboration with western countries within NATO.\nDuring Cold War era politics, Sweden was not under the Warsaw Pact and received only minimal aid from the Marshall Plan. In 1952, a Swedish DC-3 was shot down over the Baltic Sea while gathering reconnaissance. It was later revealed that the plane had been shot down by the Soviet Union. Another plane, a Catalina search and rescue craft, was sent out a few days later and shot down by Soviets warplanes as well.\nSweden is also very active in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the Third World.\nIn 1995 Sweden, together with Finland and Austria, joined the European Union, which extended the number of member countries from 12 to 15. Membership and its issues are among the most important questions in Swedish politics. Apart from the European Union, Sweden is also an active member of the United Nations and several other organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and International Monetary Fund.\nIn May 2022, Sweden formally applied to join the NATO alliance. The public opinion in the Nordic region had changed in favour of joining NATO since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.\nSoon after his appointment in October 2022, new foreign minister, Tobias Billstr\u00f6m, announced that Sweden will renounce \"feminist foreign policy\", implemented by the previous left-wing government.\nSweden joined NATO on 7 March 2024.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Founded on 22 September 1989 in D\u00fcsseldorf, then part of West Germany, its vision is to \"make for an inclusive world through Para sport\". Furthermore, the IPC aims to use Para sport as a catalyst to changing attitudes and legislation, creating greater opportunities for the world\u2019s 1.3 billion persons with disabilities.\nThe IPC has a democratic constitution and structure and is composed of representatives from 185 National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), 18 International Federations, three International Organizations of Sport for the Disabled (IOSDs) and five regional organizations. The IPC's headquarters is located in Bonn, Germany.\nOverview.\nOn the basis of being able to organize the Paralympic Games more efficiently and to give the Paralympic Movement one voice, the four international organizations of sports for the disabled founded the International Co-ordination Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled (ICC) in 1982. In the upcoming years, other organizations joined and the need for a democratically guided organization emerged, as demanded by the nations participating in the Paralympic Movement. They desired a democratic structure, to improve national and regional representation, which led to the foundation of the IPC as it is known today. The 1994 Paralympic Winter Games, in Norway, were the first to be organized by the IPC.\nWith its 208 member organisations, the IPC functions as an umbrella organization, in contrast to other international sports organizations for athletes with a disability, which are predominantly limited to a single sport or disability.\nA 14-member Governing Board is responsible for the governance of the IPC between meetings of the General Assembly. Robert D. Steadward became the first President in 1989. Since 2017, Andrew Parsons is President of the IPC.\nPresidents.\nThe International Paralympic Committee has had three presidents to date. Its founding president, who presided over it from 1989 to 2001, was the Canadian Robert Steadward, who had previously founded the Canadian Sports Fund for the Physically Disabled. He was succeeded in 2001 by Philip Craven, a British Paralympian and former President of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation, who served as president until 2017. Craven was succeeded by Brazil's Andrew Parsons, who was IPC Vice President from 2013 to 2017 and a former President of the Brazilian Paralympic Committee.\nGoverning Board.\nThe IPC Governing Board consists of 14 members, of which 12 are elected at the General Assembly, including the President and Vice President. The most recent election for the Governing Board was held on 12 December 2021:\nThe IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson, Vladyslava Kravchenko, and IPC Athletes' Council First Vice Chairperson, Josh Dueck, also have voting rights on the board.\nHistory.\nChronology of milestones in the development of the International Paralympic Committee and the Summer and Winter Paralympics.\nPublications.\nEach year the IPC publishes\u202fits Annual Report and every four years its Strategic Plan following consultation with IPC members. \nAcross social media, the IPC maintains several accounts under the @Paralympics banner including Instagram, TikTok, Facebook and Twitter.\nParalympic Hall of Fame.\nUntil 2016, the IPC inducted former Para athletes into the Hall of Fame in recognition of their sporting achievements.\nParalympic marketing.\nThe Organizing Committees.\nIn June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games. The agreement came into effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing, and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver.\nHowever, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC), chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\" already at the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City, with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Games in Athens and Beijing in 2008.\nThe agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006. A further extension was signed in 2012, valid until 2020. In March 2018, a historic long-term extension was signed establishing a partnership until 2032.\nNational Paralympic Committees (NPCs).\nNPCs are a national organisation recognised by the IPC as the sole representative of the Paralympic Movement in the NPC\u2019s country or territory.\nInternational Sports Federations (IFs).\nThere are 17 international federations recognized by the IPC, and there are three disability specific organizations, while the IPC has served as the international federation for multiple sports. \nAs of January 2025, the IPC through the World Para Sports name manages the governances for five Para sports. They are Para athletics, Para ice hockey, Para powerlifting, Para swimming and shooting Para sport.\nOn 30 November 2016, to distinguish them from the Paralympic Games, the IPC adopted the new blanket branding World Para\u00ae Sports, with the Para sports rebranded accordingly. It also renamed three sports to align with this new name; Paralympic shooting was renamed to \"shooting Para sport\" (to reduce confusion with parachuting) and sledge hockey became \"Para ice hockey\" (for both branding and linguistic reasons). Sports contested in the Summer Paralympics began using the new branding immediately. For winter sports, whose competitive seasons had already started by the announcement, only the world championships were immediately changed to reflect the new branding; the full switchover did not occur until the 2017\u201318 season.\nIn December 2021 during its virtual General Assembly, the IPC voted on an aspirational mandate to transfer its international governance of Para sports to independent bodies by 2026, either by transferring them to an existing governing body, or spinning off subcommittees as independent federations. A governance review published in October 2019 found that the IPC's governance \"created perceptions of conflict of interest, disparity in the application of resources, a sense of unfairness between the IPC Sports and those which are not and confusion about the IPC's role, all of which is impacting its reputation.\"\nIn July 2022, the IPC transferred governance of Para alpine skiing, Para snowboard, Para cross-country skiing and Para biathlon to the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) and International Biathlon Union (IBU) respectively. In June 2023 appointed the British Paralympic Association and UK Sport to assist in spinning off World Para Athletics and World Para Swimming as independent federations that would be based in Manchester.

Her range extended from queens to murderers.\nEarly life.\nFlora McKenzie Robson was born on 28 March 1902 in South Shields, County Durham, daughter of David Robson (1864-1947) and Eliza Robson (nee McKenzie; 1870-1953) both of Scottish descent. She had six siblings. Many of her forebears were engineers, mostly in shipping. Her father was a ship's engineer who moved from Wallsend near Newcastle to Palmers Green in 1907 and Southgate in 1910, both in north London, and later to Welwyn Garden City.\nShe was educated at the Palmers Green High School and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, where she won a bronze medal in 1921.\nCareer.\nHer father discovered that Flora had a talent for recitation and, from the age of five, she was taken around by horse and carriage to recite, and to compete in recitations. This established a pattern that remained with her.\nRobson made her stage debut in 1921. By the 1930s she was appearing in several prominent films both in the UK and in Hollywood, alongside such stars as Laurence Olivier, Paul Muni and George Raft. Her most notable role was that of Queen Elizabeth I in both \"Fire Over England\" (1937) and \"The Sea Hawk\" (1940). In 1934, Robson played the Empress Elizabeth in Alexander Korda's \"The Rise of Catherine the Great\" (1934). She was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as Angelique Buiton, a servant, in \"Saratoga Trunk\" (1945). The same year, audiences in the U.K. and the U.S. watched her performance as Ftatateeta, the nursemaid and royal confidante and murderer-upon-command to Vivien Leigh's Queen Cleopatra in the screen adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's \"Caesar and Cleopatra\" (1945).\nAfter the Second World War, demonstrating her range, she appeared in \"Holiday Camp\" (1947), the first of a series of films which featured the very ordinary Huggett family; as Sister Philippa in \"Black Narcissus\" (1947); as a magistrate in \"Good-Time Girl\" (1948); as a prospective Labour MP in \"Frieda\" (1947); and in the costume melodrama \"Saraband for Dead Lovers\" (1948). Her other film roles included the Empress Dowager Cixi in \"55 Days at Peking\" (1963), Miss Milchrest in \"Murder at the Gallop\" (1963), the Queen of Hearts in \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1972), and Livia in the aborted \"I, Claudius\" in 1937.\nShe struggled to find a footing in the theatre after she graduated from RADA with a bronze medal since she lacked the conventional good looks which were then an absolute requisite for actresses in dramatic roles. After touring in minor parts with Ben Greet's Shakespeare company she may have played small parts for two seasons in the new repertory company at Oxford, but her contract was not renewed. She was told that they required a prettier actress. Unable to secure any acting engagements, she gave up the stage at the age of 23, and she took up work as a welfare officer in the Nabisco shredded wheat factory in Welwyn Garden City. Tyrone Guthrie, due to direct a season at the new Festival Theatre, Cambridge, asked her to join his company. Her performance as the stepdaughter in Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" made her the theatrical talk of Cambridge. She followed with Isabella in \"Measure for Measure\" with Robert Donat, Pirandello's \"Naked\", the title role in \"Iphigenia in Tauris\", Varya in \"The Cherry Orchard\", and Rebecca West in Henrik Ibsen's \"Rosmersholm\".\nIn 1931, she was cast as the adulterous Abbie in Eugene O'Neill's \"Desire Under the Elms\". Her brief, shocking appearance as the doomed prostitute in James Bridie's play \"The Anatomist\" put her firmly on the road to success. \"If you are not moved by this girl's performance, then you are immovable\" the \"Observer\" critic wrote. This success would lead to her famous 1933 season as leading lady at the Old Vic.\nShe continued her acting career late into life, though not on the West End stage, from which she retired at the age of 67, often for American television films, including a lavish production of \"A Tale of Two Cities\" (in which she played Miss Pross). She also performed for British television, including \"The Shrimp and the Anemone\". In the 1960s, she continued to act in the West End, in \"Ring Round the Moon\", \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" and \"Three Sisters\", among others.\nShe continued to act on film and television. She was last briefly seen as a Stygian Witch in the fantasy adventure \"Clash of the Titans\" in 1981. Both the BBC and ITV made special programmes to celebrate her 80th birthday in 1982, and the BBC ran a short season of her best films.\nAwards and honours.\nShe was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Angelique Buiton, a Haitian maid, in \"Saratoga Trunk\" (1945).\nShe was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1952 New Year Honours, and raised to Dame Commander (DBE) in the 1960 Birthday Honours. She was also the first famous name to become president of the Brighton Little Theatre. She has a road named after her in her birthplace of South Shields.\nOn 4 July 1958, she received an honorary DLitt from Durham University at a congregation in Durham Castle.\nPersonal life and death.\nHer private life was largely focused on her large family of sisters Margaret and Shela, and her nephews and nieces.\nShe shared a home in Wykeham Terrace, Brighton with her sisters for 8 years before she died in Brighton, aged 82, in her sleep, of cancer. She was never married and had no children. The sisters died around the same time: Shela shortly before Flora, in 1984, and Margaret on 1 February 1985.\nLegacies.\nDame Flora Robson Avenue, built in 1962, in Simonside, South Shields, is named after her.\nThere is a plaque on the house in Wykeham Terrace, Dyke Road, Brighton, and also one in the doorway of St Nicholas's Church, of which Flora Robson was a great supporter.\nThere is also a plaque to commemorate the opening of the Prince Charles Cinema (Leicester Square, London) by Flora Robson.\nIn 1996, the British Film Institute erected a plaque at number 14 Marine Gardens, location of Flora Robson's other home in Brighton, where she lived from 1961 to 1976.\nA plaque at 40 Handside Lane in Welwyn Garden City records Flora Robson living there from 1923 to 1925.\nA blue plaque sponsored by Southgate District Civic Trust and Robson's former school Palmers Green High School was unveiled at her family home from 1910 to 1921, The Lawe, 65, The Mall, Southgate, on 25 April 2010.\nRobson attended the opening of the Flora Robson Playhouse in Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne, in 1962, which was named in her honour. The building was demolished in 1971 and the theatre company it housed relocated to the new University Theatre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67679", "revid": "48789554", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67679", "title": "Bullet", "text": "Projectile propelled by a firearm, sling, or air gun\nA bullet is a kinetic projectile, a component of firearm ammunition that is shot from a gun barrel. They are made of a variety of materials, such as copper, lead, steel, polymer, rubber and even wax; and are made in various shapes and constructions (depending on the intended applications), including specialized functions such as hunting, target shooting, training, and combat. Bullets are often tapered, making them more aerodynamic. Bullet size is expressed by weight and diameter (referred to as \"caliber\") in both imperial and metric measurement systems. Bullets do not normally contain explosives but strike or damage the intended target by transferring kinetic energy upon impact and penetration.\nDescription.\nThe term \"bullet\" is from Early French, originating as the diminutive of the word \"boulle\" (\"boullet\"), which means \"small ball\". Bullets are available singly (as in muzzle-loading and cap and ball firearms) but are more often packaged with propellant as a cartridge (\"round\" of ammunition) consisting of the \"bullet\" (i.e., the projectile), the \"case\" (which holds everything together), the \"propellant\" (which provides the majority of the energy to launch the projectile), and the \"primer\" (which ignites the propellant). Cartridges, in turn, may be held in a \"magazine\", a clip, or a \"belt\" (for rapid-fire automatic firearms). Although the word \"bullet\" is often used in colloquial language to refer to a cartridge round, a bullet is \"not\" a cartridge but rather a component of one. This use of the term \"bullet\" (when intending to describe a cartridge) often leads to confusion when a cartridge and all its components are specifically being referenced.\nThe sound of gunfire (i.e. the \"muzzle report\") is often accompanied with a loud bullwhip-like crack as the supersonic bullet pierces through the air, creating a sonic boom. Bullet speeds at various stages of flight depend on intrinsic factors such as sectional density, aerodynamic profile and ballistic coefficient, as well as extrinsic factors such as barometric pressure, humidity, air temperature and wind speed. Subsonic cartridges fire bullets slower than the speed of sound, so there are no sonic booms. This means that a subsonic cartridge, such as .45 ACP, can be substantially quieter than a supersonic cartridge, such as the .223 Remington, even without the use of a suppressor.\nBullets shot by firearms can be used for target practice or to injure or kill animals or people. Death can be by blood loss or damage to vital organs, or even asphyxiation if blood enters the lungs. Bullets are not the only projectiles shot from firearm-like equipment: BBs are shot from BB guns, airsoft pellets are shot by airsoft guns, paintballs are shot by paintball markers, and small rocks can be hurtled from slingshots. There are also flare guns, potato guns (and spud guns), tasers, bean bag rounds, grenade launchers, flash bangs, tear gas, RPGs, and missile launchers.\nSpeed.\nBullets used in many cartridges are fired at muzzle velocities faster than the speed of sound\u2014about in dry air at \u2014and thus can travel substantial distances to their targets before any nearby observers hear the sound of the shots.\nRifle bullets, such as that of a Remington 223 firing lightweight varmint projectiles from a barrel, leave the muzzle at speeds of up to . A bullet from a 9\u00a0mm Luger handgun, reaches speeds of only . Similarly, an AK-47, has a muzzle velocity of about .\nHistory.\nThe first true gun evolved in China from the fire lance (a bamboo tube that fired porcelain shrapnel) with the invention of the metal hand cannon sometime around 1288, which the Yuan dynasty used to win a decisive victory against Mongolian rebels. The artillery cannon appeared in 1326 and the European hand cannon in 1364. Early projectiles were made of stone. Eventually it was discovered that stone would not penetrate stone fortifications, which led to the use of denser materials as projectiles. Hand cannon projectiles developed in a similar manner. The first recorded instance of a metal ball from a hand cannon penetrating armor was in 1425. Shot retrieved from the wreck of the \"Mary Rose\" (sunk in 1545, raised in 1982) are of different sizes, and some are stone while others are cast iron.\nThe development of the hand culverin and matchlock arquebus brought about the use of cast lead balls as projectiles. The original round musket ball was smaller than the bore of the barrel. At first it was loaded into the barrel just resting upon the powder. Later, some sort of material was used as a wadding between the ball and the powder as well as over the ball to keep it in place, it held the bullet firmly in the barrel and against the powder. (Bullets not firmly set on the powder risked exploding the barrel, with the condition known as a \"short start\".)\nThe loading of muskets was therefore easy with the old smooth-bore Brown Bess and similar military muskets. The original muzzle-loading rifle, however, was loaded with a piece of leather or cloth wrapped around the ball, to allow the ball to engage the grooves in the barrel. Loading was a bit more difficult, particularly when the bore of the barrel was fouled from previous firings. For this reason, and because rifles were not often fitted for bayonets, early rifles were rarely used for military purposes, compared to muskets.\nThere was a distinct change in the shape and function of the bullet during the first half of the 19th century, although experiments with various types of elongated projectiles had been made in Britain, America and France from the first half of the 18th century onwards. In 1816, Capt. George Reichenbach of the Bavarian army invented a rifled-wall musket using cylindro-conical ammunition. In 1826, Henri-Gustave Delvigne, a French infantry officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which a spherical bullet was rammed down until it caught the rifling grooves. Delvigne's method, however, deformed the bullet and was inaccurate. In 1855, a detachment of 1st U.S. Dragoons, while on patrol, traded lead for gold bullets with Pima Indians along the California\u2013Arizona border.\nSquare bullets have origins that almost pre-date civilization and were used in slings. They were typically made out of copper or lead. The most notable use of square bullet designs was by James Puckle and Kyle Tunis who patented them, where they were briefly used in one version of the Puckle gun. The early use of these in the black-powder era was soon discontinued because of the irregular and unpredictable flight patterns.\nPointed bullets.\nDelvigne continued to develop bullet design and by 1830 had started to develop cylindro-conical bullets. His bullet designs were improved by Francois Tamisier with the addition of \"ball grooves\" which are known as \"cannelures\", which moved the resistance of air behind the center of gravity of the bullet. Tamisier also developed progressive rifling: the rifle grooves were deeper toward the breech, becoming shallower as they progressed toward the muzzle. This causes the bullet to be progressively molded into the grooves which increases range and accuracy.\nAmong the first pointed or \"conical\" bullets were those designed by Captain John Norton of the British Army in 1832. Norton's bullet had a hollow base made of lotus pith that on firing expanded under pressure to engage with a barrel's rifling. The British Board of Ordnance rejected it because spherical bullets had been in use for the previous 300 years. Renowned English gunsmith William Greener invented the Greener bullet in 1836. Greener fitted the hollow base of an oval bullet with a wooden plug that more reliably forced the base of the bullet to expand and catch the rifling. Tests proved that Greener's bullet was effective, but the military rejected it because, being two parts, they judged it as too complicated to produce.\nThe carabine \u00e0 tige, developed by Louis-\u00c9tienne de Thouvenin in 1844, was an improvement of Delvigne's design. The rifle barrel has a forcing plug in the breech of the barrel to mold the bullet into the rifling with the use of a special ramrod. While successful in increasing accuracy, it was difficult to clean.\nThe soft lead Mini\u00e9 ball was first introduced in 1847 by Claude-\u00c9tienne Mini\u00e9, a captain in the French Army. It was another improvement of the work done by Delvigne. The bullet was conical in shape with a hollow cavity in the rear, which was fitted with a small iron cap instead of a wooden plug. When fired, the iron cap forced itself into the hollow cavity at the rear of the bullet, thus expanding the sides of the bullet to grip and engage the rifling. In 1851, the British adopted the Mini\u00e9 ball for their 702-inch Pattern 1851 Mini\u00e9 rifle. In 1855, James Burton, a machinist at the U.S. Armory at Harper's Ferry, West Virginia, improved the Mini\u00e9 ball further by eliminating the metal cup in the bottom of the bullet. The Mini\u00e9 ball first saw widespread use in the Crimean War (1853\u20131856). Roughly 90% of the battlefield casualties in the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) were caused by Mini\u00e9 balls fired from rifled muskets. A similar bullet called the Nessler ball was also developed for smoothbore muskets.\nBetween 1854 and 1857, Sir Joseph Whitworth conducted a long series of rifle experiments and proved, among other points, the advantages of a smaller bore and, in particular, of an elongated bullet. The Whitworth bullet was made to fit the grooves of the rifle mechanically. The Whitworth rifle was never adopted by the government, although it was used extensively for match purposes and target practice between 1857 and 1866. In 1861, W. B. Chace approached President Abraham Lincoln with an improved ball design for muskets. In firing over the Potomac River, where the Chace ball and the round ball were alternated, Lincoln observed that the Chace design carried a third or more farther fired at the same elevation. Although Lincoln recommended testing, it never took place.\nAround 1862, W. E. Metford carried out an exhaustive series of experiments on bullets and rifling, and he invented the important system of light rifling with increasing spiral and a hardened bullet. The combined result was that, in December 1888, the Lee\u2013Metford small-bore (.303\", 7.70\u00a0mm) rifle, Mark I, was adopted for the British army. The Lee\u2013Metford was the predecessor of the Lee\u2013Enfield.\nModern bullets.\nThe next important change in the history of the rifle bullet occurred in 1882, when Lieutenant Colonel Eduard Rubin, director of the Swiss Army Laboratory at Thun, invented the copper-jacketed bullet \u2014 an elongated bullet with a lead core in a copper jacket. It was also small bore (7.5 and 8\u00a0mm) and it is the precursor of the 8\u00a0mm \"Lebel bullet\" adopted for the smokeless powder ammunition of the Lebel Model 1886 rifle. The surface of lead bullets fired at high velocity may melt from the hot gases behind and friction within the bore. Because copper has a higher melting point, and greater specific heat capacity, and higher hardness, copper-jacketed bullets allow greater muzzle velocities.\nEuropean advances in aerodynamics led to the pointed spitzer bullet. By the beginning of the 20th century, most world armies had begun the transition to spitzer bullets. These bullets flew for greater distances more accurately and transferred more kinetic energy. Spitzer bullets combined with machine guns greatly increased lethality on the battlefield.\nSpitzer bullets were streamlined at the base with the boat tail. In the trajectory of a bullet, as air passes over a bullet at high speed, a vacuum is created at the end of the bullet, slowing the projectile. The streamlined boat tail design reduces this form drag by allowing the air to flow along the surface of the tapering end. The resulting aerodynamic advantage is currently seen as the optimum shape for rifle technology. The first combination spitzer and boat-tail bullet, named \"balle\" D by its inventor Captain Georges Desaleux, was introduced as standard military ammunition in 1901, for the French Lebel Model 1886 rifle.\nA ballistic tip bullet is a hollow-point rifle bullet that has a plastic tip on the end of the bullet. This improves external ballistics by streamlining the bullet, allowing it to cut through the air more easily, and improves terminal ballistics by allowing the bullet to act as a jacketed hollow point. As a side effect, it also feeds better in weapons that have trouble feeding rounds that are not full metal jacket rounds.\nDesign.\nBullet designs have to solve two primary problems. In the barrel, they must first form a seal with the gun's bore. If a strong seal is not achieved, gas from the propellant charge leaks past the bullet, thus reducing efficiency and possibly accuracy. The bullet must also engage the rifling without damaging or excessively fouling the gun's bore and without distorting the bullet, which will also reduce accuracy. Bullets must have a surface that forms this seal without excessive friction. These interactions between bullet and bore are termed internal ballistics. Bullets must be produced to a high standard, as surface imperfections can affect firing accuracy.\nThe physics affecting the bullet once it leaves the barrel is termed external ballistics. The primary factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation imparted by the rifling of the gun barrel. Rotational forces stabilize the bullet gyroscopically as well as aerodynamically. Any asymmetry in the bullet is largely canceled as it spins. However, a spin rate greater than the optimum value adds more trouble than good, by magnifying the smaller asymmetries or sometimes resulting in the bullet breaking apart in flight. With smooth-bore firearms, a spherical shape is optimal because no matter how the bullet is oriented, its aerodynamics are similar. These unstable bullets tumble erratically and provide only moderate accuracy; however, the aerodynamic shape changed little for centuries. Generally, bullet shapes are a compromise between aerodynamics, interior ballistic necessities, and terminal ballistics requirements.\nTerminal ballistics and stopping power are aspects of bullet design that affect what happens when a bullet impacts with an object. The outcome of the impact is determined by the composition and density of the target material, the angle of incidence, and the velocity and physical characteristics of the bullet. Bullets are generally designed to penetrate, deform, or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the strike velocity is the primary factor that determines which outcome is achieved.\nBullet shapes are many and varied. With a mold, bullets can be made at home for reloading ammunition, where local laws allow. Hand-casting, however, is only time- and cost-effective for solid lead bullets. Cast and jacketed bullets are also commercially available from numerous manufacturers for handloading and are most often more convenient than casting bullets from bulk or scrap lead.\nIn recent years, manufacturers have introduced bullet designs that rely on computer numerical control (CNC) machining to achieve precise, repeatable geometries not possible with traditional swaging or casting. These designs often feature patented profiles with radial flutes, pressure cavities, or meplat modifications intended to manipulate fluid displacement, induce controlled expansion, or promote bullet tumbling upon impact.\nOne notable example includes the designs patented by Lehigh Defense, which incorporate machined flutes that channel hydraulic force to create large wound cavities and ensure consistent terminal performance. These bullets are often monolithic in composition and used in hunting and self-defense contexts where expansion and barrier penetration are critical.\nPropulsion.\nPropulsion of the ball can happen via several methods:\nMaterials.\nBullets for black powder, or muzzle-loading firearms, were classically molded from pure lead. This worked well for low-speed bullets, fired at velocities of less than 450\u00a0m/s (1,475\u00a0ft/s). For slightly higher-speed bullets fired in modern firearms, a harder alloy of lead and tin or typesetter's lead (used to mold linotype) works very well. For even higher-speed bullet use, jacketed lead bullets are used. The common element in all of these, lead, is widely used because it is very dense, thereby providing a high amount of mass\u2014and thus, kinetic energy\u2014for a given volume. Lead is also cheap, easy to obtain, easy to work, and melts at a low temperature, which results in comparatively easy fabrication of bullets.\nTreaties and prohibitions.\nPoisonous bullets were a subject to an international agreement as early as the Strasbourg Agreement (1675). The Saint Petersburg Declaration of 1868 prohibited the use of explosive projectiles weighing less than 400\u00a0grams. The Hague Conventions prohibits certain kinds of ammunition for use in war. These include poisoned and expanding bullets. Protocol III of the 1983 Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, an annexed protocol to the Geneva Conventions, prohibits the use of incendiary ammunitions against civilians.\nTypes of bullets.\nSome types of bullets include:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The school specialises in the pure and applied social sciences.\nFounded by Fabian Society members Sidney Webb, Beatrice Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw, LSE joined the University of London in 1900 and offered its first degree programmes under the auspices of that university in 1901. In 2008, LSE began awarding degrees in its own name. LSE became a university in its own right within the University of London in 2022.\nLSE is located in the London Borough of Camden and Westminster, Central London, near the boundary between Covent Garden and Holborn in the area historically known as Clare Market. As of 2023/24, LSE had under 13,000 students, with a majority enroled being postgraduate students and just under two thirds coming from outside the United Kingdom. The university has the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK and it had an income of \u00a3525.6\u00a0million in 2023/24, of which \u00a341.4\u00a0million was from research grants.&lt;ref name=\"LSE Financial Statement 23/24\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nLSE is a member of the Russell Group, the Association of Commonwealth Universities and the European University Association, and is typically considered part of the \"golden triangle\" of research universities in the south east of England. The British Library of Political and Economic Science, commonly referred to as \"LSE Library\", is the main library of the university, and one of the largest libraries in the world devoted to the economic and social sciences.\nSince 1990, the London School of Economics (LSE) has educated 24 heads of state or government, the second highest number of any university in the United Kingdom, and since the school's establishment, over 40 world leaders have taught or studied at LSE. The school also educated two presidents of the European Commission, Romano\u202fProdi and Ursula\u202fvon\u202fder\u202fLeyen, billionaire investor George\u202fSoros, chief architect of India's constitution, B.\u202fR.\u202fAmbedkar, and naturalist David Attenborough. As of 2025, LSE alumnus W. Arthur Lewis is the only black person to have ever won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics.\nIn 1942, former LSE director William Beveridge authored the Beveridge Report, which laid the groundwork for the establishment of free healthcare in the United Kingdom, a policy then implemented by British prime minister Clement Attlee, who had lectured at the LSE. As of 2025, LSE has been affiliated with 21 Nobel laureates.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe London School of Economics and Political Science was founded in 1895 by Beatrice and Sidney Webb, Graham Wallas and George Bernard Shaw initially funded by a bequest of \u00a320,000 from the estate of Henry Hunt Hutchinson. Hutchinson, a lawyer and member of the Fabian Society, left the money in trust, to be put \"towards advancing its [The Fabian Society's] objects in any way they [the trustees] deem advisable\". The five trustees were Sidney Webb, Edward Pease, Constance Hutchinson, W. S. de Mattos and William Clark.\nLSE records that the proposal to establish the school was conceived during a breakfast meeting on 4 August 1894, between the Webbs, Louis Flood, and George Bernard Shaw. The proposal was accepted by the trustees in February 1895 and LSE held its first classes in October of that year, in rooms at 9 John Street, Adelphi, in the City of Westminster.\n20th century.\nThe school joined the federal University of London in 1900 and was recognised as a Faculty of Economics of the university. The University of London degrees of BSc (Econ) and DSc (Econ) were established in 1901, the first university degrees dedicated to the social sciences. Expanding rapidly over the following years, the school moved initially to the nearby 10 Adelphi Terrace, then to Clare Market and Houghton Street. The foundation stone of the Old Building, on Houghton Street, was laid by King George V in 1920; the building was opened in 1922.\nThe school's arms, including its motto and beaver mascot, were adopted in February 1922, on the recommendation of a committee of twelve, including eight students, which was established to research the matter. The Latin motto, , is taken from Virgil's Georgics. Its English translation is \"to Know the Causes of Things\" and it was suggested by Professor Edwin Cannan. The beaver mascot was selected for its associations with \"foresight, constructiveness, and industrious behaviour\".\nThe economic debate between the LSE and the University of Cambridge during the 1930s is a well-known chapter in academic circles. The rivalry between academic opinion at LSE and Cambridge goes back to the school's roots when LSE's Edwin Cannan (1861\u20131935), Professor of Economics, and Cambridge's Professor of Political Economy, Alfred Marshall (1842\u20131924), the leading economist of the day, argued about the bedrock matter of economics and whether the subject should be considered as an organic whole. (Marshall disapproved of LSE's separate listing of pure theory and its insistence on economic history.)\nThe dispute also concerned the question of the economist's role, and whether this should be as a detached expert or a practical adviser. Despite the traditional view that the LSE and Cambridge were fierce rivals through the 1920s and 30s, they worked together in the 1920s on the London and Cambridge Economic Service. However, the 1930s brought a return to disputes as economists at the two universities argued over how best to address the economic problems caused by the Great Depression.\nThe main figures in this debate were John Maynard Keynes from Cambridge and the LSE's Friedrich Hayek. The LSE economist Lionel Robbins was also heavily involved. Starting off as a disagreement over whether demand management or deflation was the better solution to the economic problems of the time, it eventually embraced much wider concepts of economics and macroeconomics. Keynes put forward the theories now known as Keynesian economics, involving the active participation of the state and public sector, while Hayek and Robbins followed the Austrian School, which emphasised free trade and opposed state involvement.\nDuring World War II, the school decamped from London to the University of Cambridge, occupying buildings belonging to Peterhouse.\nFollowing the decision to establish a modern business school within the University of London in the mid-1960s, the idea was discussed of setting up a \"Joint School of Administration, Economics, and Technology\" between the LSE and Imperial College. However, this avenue was not pursued and instead, the London Business School was created as a college of the university.\nIn 1966, the appointment of Sir Walter Adams as director sparked opposition from the student union and student protests. Adams had previously been principal of the University College of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and the students objected to his failure to oppose Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence and cooperation with the white minority government. This broadened into wider concerns about links between the LSE and its governors and investments in Rhodesia and South Africa and concerns over LSE's response to student protests. These led to the closure of the school for 25 days in 1969 after a student attempt to dismantle the school gates resulted in the arrest of over 30 students. Injunctions were taken out against 13 students (nine from LSE), with three students ultimately being suspended, two foreign students being deported, and two staff members seen as supporting the protests being fired.\nIn the 1970s, four Nobel Memorial Prizes in Economic Sciences were awarded to economists associated with the LSE: John Hicks (lecturer 1926\u201336) in 1972, Friedrich Hayek (lecturer 1931\u201350) in 1974, James Meade (lecturer 1947\u20131957) in 1977 and Arthur Lewis (BSc Econ 1937, and the LSE's first Black academic 1938\u201344) in 1979.\n21st century.\nIn the early 21st century, the LSE had a wide impact on British politics. \"The Guardian\" described the LSE's influence in 2005 when it stated:\nOnce again the political clout of the school, which seems to be closely wired into parliament, Whitehall, and the Bank of England, is being felt by ministers. ... The strength of LSE is that it is close to the political process: Mervyn King, was a former LSE professor. The former chairman of the House of Commons education committee, Barry Sheerman, sits on its board of governors, along with Labour peer Lord (Frank) Judd. Also on the board are Tory MPs Virginia Bottomley and Richard Shepherd, as well as Lord Saatchi and Lady Howe.\nCommenting in 2001 on the rising status of the LSE, the British magazine \"The Economist\" stated that \"two decades ago the LSE was still the poor relation of the University of London's other colleges. Now... it regularly follows Oxford and Cambridge in league tables of research output and teaching quality and is at least as well-known abroad as Oxbridge\". According to the magazine, the school \"owes its success to the single-minded, American-style exploitation of its brand name and political connections by the recent directors, particularly Mr Giddens and his predecessor, John Ashworth\" and raises money from foreign students' high fees, who were drawn to LSE by the prominence of its academic figures, such as Richard Sennett.\nIn 2006, the school published a report disputing the costs of British government proposals to introduce compulsory ID cards. LSE academics were also represented on numerous national and international bodies in the early 21st century, including the UK Airports Commission, Independent Police Commission, Migration Advisory Committee, UN Advisory Board on Water and Sanitation, London Finance Commission, HS2 Limited, the UK government's Infrastructure Commission and advising on architecture and urbanism for the London 2012 Olympics\nThe LSE gained its own degree-awarding powers in 2006 and the first LSE degrees (rather than degrees of the University of London) were awarded in 2008.\nFollowing the passage of the University of London Act 2018, the LSE (along with other member institutions of the University of London) announced in early 2019 that they would seek university status in their own right while remaining part of the federal university. Approval of university title was received from the Office for Students in May 2022 and updated Articles of Association formally constituting the school as a university were approved by LSE council 5 July 2022.\nControversies.\nIn February 2011, LSE had to face the consequences of matriculating one of Muammar Gaddafi's sons while accepting a \u00a31.5m donation to the university from his family. LSE director Howard Davies resigned over allegations about the institution's links to the Libyan regime. The LSE announced in a statement that it had accepted his resignation with \"great regret\" and that it had set up an external inquiry into the school's relationship with the Libyan regime and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, to be conducted by the former lord chief justice Harry Woolf.\nIn 2013, the LSE was featured in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary on North Korea, filmed inside the repressive regime by undercover journalists attached to a trip by the LSE's Grimshaw Club, a student society of the international relations department. The trip had been sanctioned by high-level North Korean officials. The trip caused international media attention as a BBC journalist was posing as a part of LSE. There was debate as to whether this put the students' lives in jeopardy in the repressive regime if a reporter had been exposed. The North Korean government made hostile threats towards the students and LSE after the publicity, which forced an apology from the BBC.\nIn August 2015, it was revealed that the university was paid approximately \u00a340,000 for a \"glowing report\" for Camila Batmanghelidjh's charity, Kids Company. The study was used by Batmanghelidjh to prove that the charity provided good value for money and was well managed. The university did not disclose that the study was funded by the charity.\nIn 2023, the LSE formally cut ties with the LGBT charity Stonewall, a decision which was sharply criticized as transphobic by the LSE Student Union but praised by gender-critical activists as being conducive to freedom of speech.\nIn 2024 emails between LSE senior staff described students wearing keffiyeh who were protesting the university's investments in Israel as being \"dressed as terrorists\".\nIndustrial disputes.\nIn the summer of 2017, dozens of campus cleaners contracted via Noonan Services went on weekly strikes, protesting outside key buildings and causing significant disruption during end-of-year examinations. The dispute organised by the UVW union was originally over unfair dismissals of cleaners, but had escalated into a broad demand for decent employment rights matching those of LSE's in-house employees. Owen Jones did not cross the picket line after arriving for a debate on grammar schools with Peter Hitchens. It was announced in June 2018 that some 200 outsourced workers at the LSE would be offered in-house contracts.\nSince 2014/15, levels of academic casualisation have increased at the LSE, with the number of academics on fixed-term contracts increasing from 47% in 2016/2017 to 59% in 2021/2022, according to Higher Education Statistical Agency data (internal LSE data puts the latest figure at 58.5%). During this same period, comparable universities such as University of Edinburgh, University College London and Imperial all increased their rates of permanent staff relative to those on fixed term contracts. Only Oxford had a higher proportion of casual academic work for the 2021/2022 year (66%) although in contrast to LSE, the proportion remained constant rather than rising. As a result, the student-to-permanent staff ratio at LSE has worsened and had, as of July 2023, the worst student-to-permanent staff ratio among comparable universities in the UK, according to HESA data. According to research conducted by the LSE UCU Branch into staff well-being, 82% of fixed term academic staff at the LSE experienced regular or constant anxiety about their professional futures. In the same survey, overwork and mental health issues were reported as endemic among respondents, with 40% of fellows reporting that their teaching hours exceeded LSE's universal teaching limit of 100 hours per academic year for LSE Fellows.\nIn response to industrial action, which included not marking student work, taken by UCU in the summer of 2023 over pay and casualised working conditions, the LSE management took the decision to not accept partial performance of duties and to impose pay deductions on academic staff participating in the action. The LSE also introduced an 'Exceptional Degree Classification Schemes' policy, allowing undergraduate and taught postgraduate students to be awarded provisional degrees on the basis of fewer grades than normally required. In the event that the final classification (once all marks are available) is lower than the provisional classification, the higher provisional classification will stand as the degree classification.\n\"The World Turned Upside Down\".\nA sculpture by Mark Wallinger, \"The World Turned Upside Down\", which features a globe resting on its north pole, was installed in Sheffield Street on the LSE campus on 26 March 2019. The artwork attracted controversy for showing Taiwan as a sovereign state rather than as part of China, Lhasa being denoted as a full capital and depicting boundaries between India and China as recognised internationally. The sculpture also did not depict the State of Palestine as a separate country from Israel.\nAfter protests and reactions from both Chinese and Taiwanese students, The university decided later that year that it would retain the original design which coloured the People's Republic of China and Taiwan as different entities, consistent with the status quo, but with the addition of an asterisk beside the name of Taiwan and a corresponding placard that clarified the institution's position regarding the controversy.\nCampus and estate.\nSince 1902, LSE has been based at Clare Market and Houghton Street (first syllable pronounced \"How\") in Westminster. It is surrounded by a number of important institutions including the Royal Courts of Justice, all four Inns of Courts, Royal College of Surgeons, Sir John Soane's Museum, and the West End is immediately across Kingsway from campus, which also borders the City of London and is within walking distance to Trafalgar Square and the Houses of Parliament.\nIn 1920, King George V laid the foundation of the Old Building. The campus now occupies an almost continuous group of around 30 buildings between Kingsway and Aldwych. Alongside teaching and academic space, the institution owns 11 student halls of residence across London, a West End theatre (the Peacock), early years centre, NHS medical centre and extensive sports ground in Berrylands, south London. LSE operates the George IV public house and the students' union operates the Three Tuns bar. The school's campus is noted for its numerous public art installations, which include Richard Wilson's \"Square the Block\", Michael Brown's \"Blue Rain\", Christopher Le Brun's \"Desert Window\", and Turner Prize-winner Mark Wallinger's \"The World Turned Upside Down\".\nSince the early 2000s, the campus has undergone an extensive refurbishment project and a major fund-raising \"Campaign for LSE\" raised over \u00a3100 million in what was one of the largest university fund-raising exercises outside North America. This process began with the \u00a335 million renovation of the British Library of Political and Economic Science by Foster and Partners.\nIn 2003, LSE purchased the former Public Trustee building at 24 Kingsway and engaged Sir Nicholas Grimshaw to redesign it into an ultra-modern educational facility at a total cost of over \u00a345 million \u2013 increasing the size of the campus by . The New Academic Building opened for teaching in October 2008, with an official opening by Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 5 November 2008. In November 2009 the school purchased the adjacent Sardinia House to house three academic departments and the nearby Old White Horse public house, before acquiring the freehold of the grade-II listed Land Registry Building at 32 Lincoln's Inn Fields in October 2010, which was reopened in March 2013 by The Princess Royal as the new home for the Department of Economics, International Growth Centre and its associated economic research centres. In 2015, LSE brought its ownership of buildings on Lincoln's Inn Fields to six, with the purchase of 5 Lincoln's Inn Fields on the north side of the square, which has since been converted into faculty accommodation.\nSaw Swee Hock Student Centre.\nThe first new campus building for more than 40 years, the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre, named after the Singaporean statistician and philanthropist, opened in January 2014 following an architectural design competition managed by RIBA Competitions. The building provides accommodation for the LSE Students' Union, LSE accommodation office and LSE careers service as well as a bar, events space, gymnasium, rooftop terrace, learning caf\u00e9, dance studio, and media centre. Designed by architectural practice O'Donnell &amp; Tuomey, the building achieved a BREEAM 'Outstanding' rating for environmental sustainability, won multiple awards including the RIBA National Award and London Building of the Year Award, and was shortlisted for the Stirling Prize.\nCentre Building.\nThe Centre Building, situated opposite the British Library of Political and Economic Science, opened in June 2019. Designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners following a RIBA competition, the 13-storey building includes 14 seminar rooms seating between 20 and 60, 234 study spaces, a 200-seater auditorium, as well as three lecture theatres. The building hosts the School of Public Policy, the Departments of Government and International Relations, the European Institute, and the International Inequalities Institute. It includes publicly accessible roof terraces and a renovated square at the centre of campus. The building design was recognised with RIBA's London Award and National Award in 2021.\nMarshall Building.\nThe Marshall Building, located at 44 Lincoln's Inn Fields, opened in January 2022. Designed by Grafton Architects and named after British investor Paul Marshall, the building houses the Departments of Management, Accounting, and Finance, sports facilities, and the Marshall Institute for Philanthropy and Social Entrepreneurship. The site was previously home to the Francis Crick Institute's laboratories, which LSE purchased in 2013.\nFuture expansion.\nThe LSE acquired the Nuffield Building at 35 Lincoln's Inn Fields from the Royal College of Surgeons in 2017 in order to redevelop the site as the Firoz Lalji Global Hub, hosting the departments of mathematics and statistics, the data science institute, and conference and executive education facilities. The new building was designed by David Chipperfield Architects, with Adamson Associates as executive architect. Planning permission was granted and demolition work started in 2024, with expected completion of construction by summer 2027.\nSustainability.\nIn 2021, LSE claimed to be the first UK university to be independently verified as carbon-neutral, which it achieved by funding rainforest trees to offset emissions through the Finnish organisation (Oy) Compensate. However, LSE omitted some of its emissions in its calculation and thus did not offset all of them. While it measured and offset emissions from heating, electricity, and faculty air travel, the school left out other travel-related emissions, as well as emissions from construction and on-campus food. LSE plans to offset the remaining emissions (scope 1 through 3) by 2050.\nOrganisation and administration.\nGovernance.\nAlthough LSE is a member institution of the federal University of London, it is also a university in its own right and awards it own degrees.\nLSE is incorporated under the Companies Act as a company limited by guarantee and is an exempt charity within the meaning of Schedule Two of the Charities Act 1993. The principal governance bodies of the LSE are: the LSE Council; the Court of Governors; the academic board; and the director and director's management team.\nThe LSE Council is responsible for strategy and its members are company directors of the school. It has specific responsibilities in relation to areas including the monitoring of institutional performance; finance and financial sustainability; audit arrangements; estate strategy; human resource and employment policy; health and safety; \"educational character and mission\", and student experience. The council is supported in carrying out its role by a number of committees that report directly to it.\nThe Court of Governors deals with certain constitutional matters and has pre-decision discussions on key policy issues and the involvement of individual governors in the school's activities. The court has the following formal powers: the appointment of members of the court, its subcommittees, and the council; election of the chair and vice chairs of the court and council and honorary fellows of the school; the amendment of the memorandum and articles of association; and the appointment of external auditors.\nThe academic board is LSE's principal academic body and considers all major issues of general policy affecting the academic life of the school and its development. It is chaired by the director, with staff and student membership, and is supported by its own structure of committees. The vice chair of the academic board serves as a non-director member of the council and makes a termly report to the council. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Academic Board has moved online and has not yet returned to in-person meetings, changing the dynamic of engagement.\nPresident and vice-chancellor.\nThe president and vice-chancellor (titled director until 2022) is the head of LSE and its chief executive officer, responsible for executive management and leadership on academic issues. The vice-chancellor reports to and is accountable to the council. The vice-chancellor is also the accountable officer for the purposes of the Office for Students financial memorandum. The LSE's current vice-chancellor is Larry Kramer, who took office in April 2024.\nThe vice-chancellor is supported by four pro-vice chancellors with designated portfolios (education; research; planning and resources; faculty development), the school secretary, the chief operating officer, the chief finance officer, and the chief philanthropy and global engagement officer.\nAcademic departments and institutes.\nLSE's research and teaching are organised into a network of independent academic departments established by the LSE Council, the school's governing body, on the advice of the academic board, the school's senior academic authority. There are currently 27 academic departments or institutes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nFinances.\nIn the financial year ending 31 July 2024, LSE had a total income of \u00a3525.6\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3466.1\u00a0million) and total expenditure of \u00a3344.4\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3424.8\u00a0million). Key sources of income included \u00a3316.4\u00a0million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3295.0\u00a0million), \u00a326.8\u00a0million from funding body grants (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a329.1\u00a0million), \u00a341.4\u00a0million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a339.6\u00a0million), \u00a311.6\u00a0million from investment income (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a37.8\u00a0million) and \u00a349.3\u00a0million from donations and endowments (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a322.7\u00a0million).\nAt year end, the LSE had endowments of \u00a3255.5\u00a0million (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3229.3\u00a0million) and total net assets of \u00a31.009\u00a0billion (2022/23 \u2013 \u00a3793.2\u00a0million).\nThe Times Higher Education Pay Survey 2017 revealed that, among larger, non-specialist institutions, LSE professors and academics were the highest paid in the UK, with average incomes of \u00a3103,886 and \u00a365,177 respectively.\nEndowment.\nThe LSE is aiming to increase the size of its endowment fund to more than \u00a31bn, which would make it one of the best resourced institutions in the UK and the world. The effort was initiated in 2016 by Lord Myners, then chairman of the LSE's Council and Court of Governors. The plan includes working with wealthy alumni of LSE to make large contributions, increasing the annual budget surplus, and launching a new, widescale alumni donor campaign. The plan to grow LSE's endowment to more than \u00a31bn has been continued by Lord Myners' successors at the LSE. The LSE stated in 2016 that currently \"limited endowment funding constrains our ability to offer 'needs blind' admission to students\". In the ten-year period between 2015 and 2024, the endowment more than doubled from \u00a3113 million to \u00a3255 million, making it the sixth-largest endowment of any university in the UK. Analysis of university accounts by \"Times Higher Education\" found that the LSE came third for fundraising in 2023\u201324 among the 119 members of Universities UK, with \u00a349.3 million in donations and new endowments, behind only Oxford and Cambridge.\nAcademic year.\nLSE operates on a three-term structure and has not moved to semesters. Michaelmas Term runs from October to mid-December, Lent Term from mid-January to late March, and Summer Term from late April to mid-June. Certain departments operate reading weeks in early November and mid-February.\nLogo, arms and mascot.\nThe school's historic coat of arms is used on official documentation including degree certificates and transcripts and includes the motto \u2013 \"rerum cognoscere causas\", a line taken from Virgil's \"Georgics\" meaning \"to know the causes of things\", together with the school's mascot \u2013 a beaver. Both these symbols, adopted in February 1922, continue to be held in high regard to this day with the beaver chosen because of its representation as \"a hard-working and industrious yet sociable animal\", attributes that the founders hoped LSE students to both possess and aspire to. The school's weekly newspaper is still entitled \"The Beaver\", Rosebery residence hall's bar is called the Tipsy Beaver and LSE sports teams are known as the Beavers. The institution has two sets of colours \u2013 brand and academic \u2013 red being the brand colour used on signage, publications and in buildings across campus and purple, black and gold for academic purposes including presentation ceremonies and graduation dress.\nLSE's present 'red block' logo was modified as part of a rebrand in the early 2000s. As a trademarked brand, it is carefully protected but can be produced in various forms to reflect different requirements. In its full form it contains the full name of the institution to the right of the block with a further small empty red square at the end, but it is adapted for each academic department or professional service division to provide a cohesive brand across the institution.\nAcademic profile.\nAdmissions.\nIn 2025, The London School of Economics received 30,000 applications for roughly 1900 undergraduate places or 16 applicants per place. All undergraduate applications, including international applications, are made through UCAS. LSE had the 8th highest average entry qualification for undergraduates of any UK university in 2021\u201322, with new students averaging 195 UCAS points. The university gave offers of admission to roughly 12.2% of its undergraduate applicants in 2023, one of the lowest offer rates across the UK. Bsc Economics is the most competitive undergraduate course at the LSE with over 4000 applications for just over 200 places. LLB in Laws comes second with 2600 applications for just over 170 places.\nProspective Postgraduate students applying to the LSE are required to have a first or upper second Class UK honours degree, or its foreign equivalent, for master's degrees, while direct entry to the MPhil/PhD programme requires a UK taught master's with merit, or foreign equivalent. Admission to the diploma requires a UK degree or equivalent plus relevant experience. The intake to applications ratio for postgraduate degree programmes is very competitive; the MSc Financial Mathematics had a ratio of just over 4% in 2016.\nProgrammes and degrees.\nAs of 2024,[ [update]] the school offers over 40 undergraduate programmes, over 140 taught master's programmes, and research master's and PhD programmes. Subjects pioneered in Britain by LSE include accountancy and sociology, and the school also employed Britain's first full-time lecturer in economic history. Courses are split across more than thirty research centres and nineteen departments, plus a Language Centre. In partnership with the federal University of London, LSE oversees nine BSc programmes as the lead institution which designs the curriculum. Students who chose to study online experience the same unique academic experience as on-campus, they are considered a part of LSE community and they have a variety of options to interact with their university, such as the LSE general course. Since programmes are all within the social sciences, they closely resemble each other, and undergraduate students usually take at least one course module in a subject outside of their degree for their first and second years of study, promoting a broader education in the social sciences. At undergraduate level, some departments have as few as 90 students across the three years of study. Since September 2010, it has been compulsory for first year undergraduates to participate in LSE 100: Understanding the Causes of Things alongside normal studies.\nFrom 1902, following its absorption into the University of London, until 2007, all degrees were awarded by the federal university in common with all other colleges of the university. This system was changed in 2007 to enable some colleges to award their own degrees. LSE was granted the power to begin awarding its own degrees from July 2008. All students entering from the 2007\u201308 academic year onwards received an LSE degree, while students who started before this date were issued University of London degrees. In conjunction with NYU Stern and HEC Paris, LSE also offers the TRIUM Executive MBA. This was globally ranked third among executive MBAs by the \"Financial Times\" in 2016.\nResearch.\nAccording to the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the London School of Economics was rated joint third (along with the University of Cambridge) in the UK for the quality (GPA) of its research. In the 2014 Research Excellence Framework, LSE had the joint highest percentage of world-leading research among research submitted of any institution that entered more than one unit of assessment and was ranked third by cumulative grade point average with a score of 3.35, beating both University of Oxford and University of Cambridge. It was ranked 23rd in the country for research power by Research Fortnight based on its REF 2014 results, and 28th in research power by the Times Higher Education. This followed the Research Assessment Exercise in 2008 where the school was placed second equal nationally on GPA, first for fraction of world-leading (4*) research and fourth for fraction of world-leading or internationally excellent (3* and 4*) research in LSE's analysis of the results, fourth equal for GPA and 29th for research power in Times Higher Education's analysis, and 27th in research power by Research Fortnight's analysis.\nAccording to analysis of the REF 2014 subject results by Times Higher Education, the school is the UK's leading research university in terms of GPA of research submitted in business and management; area studies; and communication, cultural and media studies, library and information management, and second in law; politics and international studies; economics and econometrics; and social work and social policy.\nResearch centres.\nThe school houses a number of centres including the Centre for the Analysis of Social Exclusion, the Centre for Climate Change Economics and Policy, the Centre for Macroeconomics, the Centre for Economic Performance, LSE Health and Social Care, the Financial Markets Group (founded by former Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King), the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (chaired by Lord Stern), LSE Cities, the UK Department for International Development funded International Growth Centre and one of the six the UK government-backed 'What Works Centres' \u2013 the What Works Centre for Local Economic Growth. The Greater London Group was an influential research centre within LSE from the late 1950s on, before being subsumed into the LSE London research group. In February 2015, Angelina Jolie and William Hague launched the UK's first academic Centre on Women, Peace and Security, based at the school. The centre aims to contribute to global women's rights issues, including violence against women and women's engagement in politics, through academic research, a post-graduate teaching program, public engagement, and collaboration with international organisations. Furthermore, in May 2016 it was announced that Jolie-Pitt and Hague would join Jane Connors and Madeleine Rees as visiting professors in practice from September 2016.\nLSE IDEAS.\nLSE IDEAS is a foreign policy think tank at the London School of Economics and Political Science. IDEAS was founded as a think tank for Diplomacy and Strategy in February 2008. It was founded by Professor Michael Cox and Professor Arne Westad. In 2015 it was jointly ranked as world's second-best university think tank for the third year running alongside the LSE Public Policy Group, after Harvard University's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\nPartnerships.\nLSE has academic partnerships in teaching and research with six universities \u2013 with Columbia University in New York City and University of California, Berkeley, in Asia with Peking University in Beijing and the National University of Singapore, in Africa with the University of Cape Town, and Europe with Sciences Po in Paris.\nTogether they offer a range of double or joint degree programmes including an MA in International and World History (with Columbia) and an MSc in international affairs with Peking University, with graduates earning degrees from both institutions. The school also offers joint degrees for specific departments with various other universities including Fudan University in Shanghai, USC in Los Angeles and a Global Studies programme which is offered with a consortium of four European universities \u2013 Leipzig, Vienna, Roskilde and Wroclaw. It offers the TRIUM Global Executive MBA programme jointly with Stern School of Business of New York University and HEC School of Management, Paris. It is divided into six modules held in five international business locations over a 16-month period. LSE also offers a Dual Master of Public Administration (MPA) with Global Public Policy Network schools such as Sciences Po Paris, the Hertie School of Governance and National University of Singapore, and a dual MPA-Master of Global Affairs (MGA) degree with the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs.\nThe school also runs exchange programmes with a number of international business schools through the Global Master's in Management programme and an undergraduate student exchange programme with the University of California, Berkeley in Political Science. LSE is the only UK member school in the CEMS Alliance, and the LSE Global Master's in Management is the only programme in the UK to offer the CEMS Master's in International Management (CEMS MIM) as a double degree option, allowing students to study at one of 34 CEMS partner universities. It also participates in Key Action 1 of the European Union-wide Erasmus+ programme, encouraging staff and student mobility for teaching, although not the other Key Actions in the programme.\nThe school is a member of the Association of Commonwealth Universities, the European University Association, the G5, the Global Alliance in Management Education, the Russell Group and Universities UK, and is sometimes considered part of the 'Golden Triangle' of universities in south-east England, along with the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, University College London, Imperial College London, and King's College London.\nLSE's European Institute offers a Double Degree in European and International Public Policy and Politics with Bocconi University in Milan.\nLibraries and archives.\nLSE's main library, the British Library of Political and Economic Science, is located in the Lionel Robbins Building, which reopened in 2001 following a two-year renovation by Foster and Partners. Founded in 1896, it is the world's largest library dedicated to social sciences and the United Kingdom's national social sciences library. Its collections are recognised for their national and international significance and hold 'Designation' status by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA). The library welcomes 1.8 million visits per year by students, staff, and the public and contains over 4 million print volumes, 60,000 online journals, and 29,000 electronic books. The Digital Library contains digitised material from LSE Library collections and also born-digital material that has been collected and preserved in digital formats.\nThe Women's Library, Britain's main library and archive on women and the women's movement, is located in a purpose-built facility with a reading room and exhibition space in the Lionel Robbins Building. The library relocated from London Metropolitan University in 2014.\nThe Shaw Library, housed in the Founders' Room in the Old Building, contains the school's collection of fiction and general readings. It functions as a general-purpose reading and common room and hosts lunchtime music concerts, press launches, and the Fabian Window, which was unveiled by Prime Minister Tony Blair in 2006.\nSeveral subject-specific libraries exist at LSE, including the Seligman Library for Anthropology, the Himmelweit Library for Social Psychology, the Leverhulme Library for Statistics, the Robert McKenzie Library for Sociology, the Michael Wise Library for Geography, and the Gender Institute Library. Additionally, LSE staff and some students are permitted to access and borrow items from Senate House Library, the SOAS Library, and select institutions through the SCONUL Access scheme.\nLSE Summer School.\nThe original LSE Summer School was established in 1989 and has since expanded to offer over 70 three-week courses in accounting, finance, economics, English language, international relations, government, law and management each July and August. It is advertised as the largest and one of the most well-established university Summer Schools of its kind in Europe.\nIn recent years, the school has expanded its summer schools both abroad and into executive education with the LSE-PKU Summer School in Beijing (run with Peking University), the LSE-UCT July School in Cape Town (run with the University of Cape Town) and the Executive Summer School at its London campus. In 2011, it also launched a Methods Summer Programme. Together these courses welcome over 5,000 participants from over 130 countries and some of the top colleges and universities around the world, as well as professionals from several multinational institutions. Participants are housed in LSE halls of residence or their overseas equivalents, and the Summer School provides a full social programme including guest lectures and receptions.\nPublic lectures.\nPublic lectures hosted by the LSE Events office, are open to students, alumni and the general public. As well as leading academics and commentators, speakers frequently include prominent national and international figures such as ambassadors, CEOs, Members of Parliament, and heads of state. A number of these are broadcast live around the world via the school's website. LSE organises over 200 public events every year.\nProminent speakers have included Kofi Annan, Ben Bernanke, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Noam Chomsky, Bill Clinton, Philip Craven, Niall Ferguson, Vicente Fox, Milton Friedman, Muammar Gaddafi, Julia Gillard, Alan Greenspan, Tenzin Gyatso, Lee Hsien Loong, Boris Johnson, David Harvey, Jean Tirole, Angelina Jolie, Paul Krugman, Dmitri Medvedev, Mario Monti, George Osborne, Robert Peston, Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era, Kevin Rudd, Jeffrey Sachs, Gerhard Schroeder, Carlos D. Mesa, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Aung San Suu Kyi, Amartya Sen, George Soros and Rowan Williams. Previously, the school has hosted figures including Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher.\nThere are also a number of annual lecture series hosted by various departments. These include but are not limited to the Malinowski Memorial Lectures hosted by the department of anthropology, the Lionel Robbins Memorial Lectures and the Ralph Miliband programme.\nPublishing.\nIn 2018, the university launched LSE Press in partnership with Ubiquity Press. This is intended to publish open-access journals and books in the social sciences. The first journal to be published by the press was the \"Journal of Illicit Economies and Development\", edited by John Collins, executive director of LSE's International Drug Policy Unit. The press is managed through the LSE Library.\nReputation and rankings.\nAnalysis of UK university alumni by Capital on Tap in 2025 showed that the LSE had the highest proportion of business leaders (CEOs, company founders and managing directors) among its graduates on LinkedIn at 19%, although the University of Cambridge (in second at 17%) had higher absolute numbers due to its larger number of alumni.\nLSE is ranked first in the UK in the Times/Sunday Times Good University Guide 2025, in addition to being awarded University of the Year. It was also named as runner-up for University of the Year for Graduate Employment.\nLSE is ranked third in the UK in the Complete University Guide 2025, and fourth in the Guardian University Guide 2025.\nIan Diamond, former chief executive of the Economic and Social Research Council and later vice-chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, a member of the THE editorial board, wrote to \"Times Higher Education\" in 2007, saying: \"The use of a citation database must have an impact because such databases do not have as wide a cover of the social sciences (or arts and humanities) as the natural sciences. Hence the low position of the London School of Economics, caused primarily by its citations score, is a result not of the output of an outstanding institution but the database and the fact that the LSE does not have the counterweight of a large natural science base.\"\nThe 2024 \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\" place LSE 8th for social sciences in the world, 11th for business and economics, 14th for law and 35th for arts and humanities, ranking the university 46th globally. The \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" (\"Shanghai Ranking\") for 2023 ranked LSE 7th in Political Science, 8th in Economics and 8th in Finance, placing it in the 151\u2013200 range.\nAccording to data released by the Department for Education in 2018, LSE was rated as the best university for boosting graduate earnings, with male graduates seeing a 47.2% increase in earnings and female graduates seeing a 38.2% increase in earnings compared to the average graduate.\nAccording to Wealth-X and UBS's \"Billionaire Census\" in 2014, LSE ranked 10th in the list of 20 schools that have produced the most billionaire alumni. The LSE was the only UK university to make the list.\nIn the 2020 National Student Survey LSE came 64th out of 154 for overall student satisfaction. The LSE had scored well below its benchmark on this measure in previous years, coming 145th out of 148 in 2017. The increase in student satisfaction in 2020 led to a climb of 14 places to fifth in the 2021 Guardian ranking.\nStudent life.\nStudent body.\nIn 2023/24, LSE's student body consisted of 12,910 students, composed of 5,680 undergraduates and 7,230 postgraduate students. In 2023/24, 8,225 students came from outside the United Kingdom (64% of the total student body). This were primarily posgraduate students, of which 5,540 (77% of all postgraduates) were from outside the United Kingdom. The undergraduate population was close to evenly split between students from the UK (53%) and international students (47%). The student body in 2024/25 was 57% female and 43% male.\nStudents' union.\nThe LSE Students' Union (LSESU) is affiliated to the National Union of Students and is responsible for campaigning and lobbying the school on behalf of students as well providing student support and the organisation and undertaking of entertainment events and student societies. It is often regarded as the most politically active in Britain \u2013 a reputation it has held since the well documented LSE student riots in 1966\u201367 and 1968\u201369, which made international headlines. In 2015, the school was awarded the top spot for student nightlife by \"The Guardian\" newspaper due in part to its central location and provision of over 200 societies, 40 sports clubs, a Raising and Giving (RAG) branch and a thriving media group. In 2013, the union moved into a purpose-built new building \u2013 the Saw Swee Hock Student Centre on the Aldwych campus.\nA weekly student newspaper \"The Beaver\", is published each Tuesday during term time and is amongst the oldest student newspapers in the country. It sits alongside a radio station, \"Pulse!\" which has existed since 1999 and a television station \"LooSE Television\" since 2005. The \"Clare Market Review\" one of Britain's oldest student publications was revived in 2008. Over \u00a3150,000 is raised for charity each year through the RAG (Raising and Giving), the fundraising arm of the Students' Union, which was started in 1980 by then Student Union Entertainments Officer and former New Zealand MP Tim Barnett.\nSporting activity is coordinated by the LSE Athletics Union, which is a constituent of British Universities &amp; Colleges Sport (BUCS).\nStudent housing.\nLSE owns or operates 10 halls of residence in and around central London and there are also two halls owned by urbanest and five intercollegiate halls (shared with other constituent colleges of the University of London) within a 3-mile radius of the school, for a total of over 4,000 places. Most residences take both undergraduates and postgraduates, although Carr-Saunders Hall and Passfield Hall are undergraduate only, and Butler's Wharf Residence, Grosvenor House and Lillian Knowles House are reserved for postgraduates. Sidney Webb House, managed by Unite Students, takes postgraduates and continuing students. There are also flats available on Anson and Carleton roads, which are reserved for students with children.\nThe school guarantees accommodation for all first-year undergraduate students and many of the school's larger postgraduate population are also catered for, with some specific residences available for postgraduate living. Whilst none of the residences are located at the Aldwych campus, the closest, Grosvenor House is within a five-minute walk from the school in Covent Garden, whilst the farthest residences (Nutford and Butler's Wharf) are approximately forty-five minutes by Tube or Bus.\nEach residence accommodates a mixture of students both home and international, male and female, and, usually, undergraduate and postgraduate. New undergraduate students (including General Course students) occupy approximately 55% of all spaces, with postgraduates taking approximately 40% and continuing students about 5% of places.\nThe largest LSE student residence, Bankside House, a refurbished early 1950s office block and former headquarters of the Central Electricity Generating Board, opened to students in 1996 and is fully catered, accommodating 617 students across eight floors overlooking the River Thames. It is located behind the Tate Modern art gallery on the south bank of the river. The second-largest residence, the High Holborn Residence in High Holborn, was opened in 1995 and is approximately 10 minutes walk from the main campus. It is self-catering, accommodating 447 students in flats of four or five bedrooms with shared facilities.\nNotable people.\nThe LSE has a long list of notable alumni and staff, spanning the fields of all scholarship provided by the school. Since 1990, the London School of Economics has educated 24 heads of state or government, the second highest of any university in the United Kingdom after the University of Oxford. The school has over 50 fellows of the British Academy on its staff, while other notable former staff members include Brian Barry, Christopher Greenwood, Maurice Cranston, Anthony Giddens, Harold Laski, Ralph Miliband, Michael Oakeshott, A. W. Philips, Karl Popper, Lionel Robbins, Susan Strange, Bob Ward and Charles Webster. Mervyn King, the former governor of the Bank of England, is also a former professor of economics.\nIn the political arena notable alumni and staff include 53 past or present heads of state, 20 members of the current British House of Commons and 46 members of the current House of Lords. Former British prime minister Clement Attlee taught at the school from 1912 to 1923. In recent British politics, former LSE students include Virginia Bottomley, Yvette Cooper, Edwina Currie, Frank Dobson, Margaret Hodge, Robert Kilroy-Silk, former UK Labour Party leader Ed Miliband and former UK Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson. Internationally, the current and first female president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, Brazilian defence minister Celso Amorim, Costa Rican president \u00d3scar Arias, former Japanese prime minister Taro Aso, Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, President of India K. R. Narayanan, President of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Tsai Ing-wen, Italian prime minister and president of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, French Foreign Minister and president of the Constitutional Council Roland Dumas as well as Singapore's president Tharman Shanmugaratnam all studied at LSE. A notable number of LSE students have also played a role in the Barack Obama administration, including Pete Rouse, Peter R. Orszag, Mona Sutphen, Paul Volcker and Jason Furman. Physician Vanessa Kerry and American journalist Susan Rasky are also alumnae of the LSE. Notable American Monica Lewinsky pursued her MSc in Social Psychology at the LSE. Current leader of the opposition of the Sri Lankan government Sajith Premadasa, and the CEO and Managing Director of the National Payments Corporation of India, Dilip Asbe, known for pioneering India's widely used UPI system; former attorney general of India, Ashok Desai also studied at the LSE.\nLSE has produced a distinguished group of alumni from across Asia who have held influential positions in politics, governance, and public service. This includes Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, India\u2019s first Law Minister and architect of the Indian Constitution; Zaini Ahmad, Bruneian politician and rebel during the 1962 Brunei revolt; Piyasvasti Amranand, Thailand's Energy Minister; Sonny Angara, senator of the Philippines; Ferdinand Alexander \u201cSandro\u201d Araneta Marcos III, Congressman and member of the prominent Marcos political family; Anna Mae Yu Lamentillo, former Philippine Undersecretary of the Department of Information and Communications Technology; Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Pakistan\u2019s defence minister; Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, former deputy foreign minister of Pakistan; Jyoti Basu, veteran Indian politician and long-serving chief minister of West Bengal; Raghav Chadha, Member of Parliament in India\u2019s Rajya Sabha; Jayant Chaudhary, Indian Rajya Sabha MP from Uttar Pradesh; Mohibul Hasan Chowdhury, Deputy Education Minister of Bangladesh; Audrey Eu, former chairperson of Hong Kong\u2019s Civic Party; Feroze Gandhi, Indian politician and journalist; Leslie Goonewardene, Sri Lankan statesman and Trotskyist activist; Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia\u2019s minister of defence; Lakshmi Kant Jha, former governor of the Reserve Bank of India and Indian ambassador to the U.S.; Yang Jiechi, senior Chinese Communist Party official and former foreign minister; Sir Yuet Keung Kan, Hong Kong politician, banker, and lawyer; Khan Abdul Qayyum Khan, Pakistani political leader and first chief minister of the North-West Frontier Province; Emily Lau, Hong Kong legislator; Marvi Memon, Pakistani National Assembly member; Krishna Menon, former Indian defence minister and UN representative; Marty Natalegawa, former Indonesian foreign minister; Melvyn Ong, Singapore\u2019s chief of defence force; Ong Ye Kung, Singapore\u2019s minister for health and former minister for education and transport; C.

Jeffries, Greek business magnate Spiros Latsis, American banker David Rockefeller, CEO of Newsmax Media Christopher Ruddy, founder of advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi Maurice Saatchi, hedge fund managers George Soros and Michael Platt and Andreas Utermann, former CEO of Allianz Global Investors.\nThe LSE has also produced many notable lawyers and judges, including Manfred Lachs (former president of the International Court of Justice), Dorab Patel (former justice of the Supreme Court of Pakistan), M\u00f3nica Feria Tinta (British-Peruvian barrister specialising in international law), Anthony Kennedy (former justice of the Supreme Court of the United States), chief architect of the Indian Constitution and jurist B. R. Ambedkar.\nA survey by employment specialists Emolument.com found that it on average took LSE graduates 11.6 years in the workforce to begin earning base salaries in excess of \u00a3500,000; the shortest timespan of any university in the United Kingdom.\nConvicted British terrorist, Omar Saeed Sheikh, studied statistics at LSE, but did not graduate. He served five years in an Indian prison for kidnapping British tourists in 1994. In 2002, he was arrested and convicted in the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl. \"The Guardian\" reported that Sheikh came into contact with radical Islamists at the LSE.\nFaculty and Nobel laureates.\nAs of 2025, 21 Nobel Prize laureates in economics, peace and literature are recognised by the school as being LSE alumni and staff.\nLSE in literature and other media.\nThe London School of Economics has been mentioned and formed the basis of setting for numerous works of fiction and in popular culture.\nNovels.\nThe first notable mention of the LSE was in literature was in the epilogue to Bernard Shaw's 1912 play \"Pygmalion\", Eliza Doolittle is sent to the LSE.\nIn around a dozen other novels, the LSE was mentioned as short-hand for a character being witty and clever but outside the establishment. This is best exhibited by Ian Fleming's CV of James Bond that included the detail that his father, Andrew, is an LSE graduate. These occurrences have continued into contemporary fiction: Lenny is the young 'hip' LSE graduate and criminologist in Jake Arnott's tour of the London underworld in \"The Long Firm\". Robert Harris' \"Enigma\" includes Baxter, a code breaker with leftist views, who has been an LSE lecturer before the war and \"My Revolutions\" by Hari Kunzru traces the career of Chris Carver aka Michael Frame who travels from LSE student radical to terrorist and on to middle England.\nLSE alumna Hilary Mantel, in \"The Experience of Love\", never mentions LSE by name but Houghton Street, the corridors of the LSE Old Building and Wright's Bar are immediately recognisable references to the campus of the school. A. S. Byatt's \"The Children's Book\" returns to LSE's Fabian roots with a plot inspired in part by the life of children's writer E. Nesbitt and Fabian Hubert Bland, and characters that choose LSE over older educational establishments (namely Oxford and Cambridge).\nTelevision.\nThe popular 1980s British sitcom \"Yes Minister\" and \"Yes Prime Minister\" make regular references to the LSE with Minister Jim Hacker (later Prime Minister) and Sir Mark Spencer (special advisor to the prime minister) regularly being subtly ridiculed for having attended the LSE. A fictional LSE graduate also appears in season three episode six of the US series, \"Mad Men\". The popular American series \"The West Wing\" following the Democratic administration of Josiah (Jed) Bartlet makes several references to Josiah Bartlet being an alumnus of the LSE. Other fictional LSE alumni are present in \"Spooks\", at least one episode of \"The Professionals\" and \"The Blacklist\" series.\nFilm.\nIn the 2014 action spy thriller \"\", the young Jack Ryan, based on a Tom Clancy character, proves his academic credentials by walking out of the Old Building as he graduates from the LSE before injuring his spine being shot down in Afghanistan. The LSE is acknowledged in \"The Social Network\" naming the institution along with Oxford and Cambridge universities in a reference to the rapid growth Facebook enjoyed both within and outside the United States in its early years.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67709", "revid": "48610686", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67709", "title": "1946 Italian institutional referendum", "text": "Birth of the Italian Republic\nAn institutional referendum (, or ) was held by universal suffrage in the Kingdom of Italy on 2 June 1946, a key event of contemporary Italian history. Until 1946, Italy was a kingdom ruled by the House of Savoy, reigning since the unification of Italy in 1861 and previously rulers of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1922, the rise of Benito Mussolini and the creation of the Fascist regime in Italy, which eventually resulted in engaging the country in World War II alongside Nazi Germany, considerably weakened the role of the royal house.\nFollowing the Italian Civil War and the Liberation of Italy from Axis troops in 1945, a popular referendum on the institutional form of the state was called the next year and resulted in voters choosing the replacement of the monarchy with a republic. The 1946 Italian general election to elect the Constituent Assembly of Italy was held on the same day. As with the simultaneous Constituent Assembly elections, the referendum was not held in the Julian March, in the province of Zara or the province of Bolzano, which were still under occupation by Allied forces pending a final settlement of the status of the territories.\nThe results were proclaimed by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 10 June 1946: 12,717,923 citizens in favor of the republic and 10,719,284 citizens in favor of the monarchy. The event is commemorated annually by the \"Festa della Repubblica\". The former King Umberto II voluntarily left the country on 13 June 1946, headed for Cascais, in southern Portugal, without even waiting for the results to be defined and the ruling on the appeals presented by the monarchist party, which were rejected by the Supreme Court of Cassation on 18 June 1946. With the entry into force of the new Constitution of the Italian Republic, on 1 January 1948, Enrico De Nicola became the first to assume the functions of president of Italy. It marked the first time that most of the Italian Peninsula was under a single republican government since the fall of the Roman Republic.\nBackground.\nRepublican ideas and the unification of Italy.\nIn the history of Italy there are several so-called \"republican\" governments that have followed one another over time. Examples are the ancient Roman Republic and the medieval maritime republics. From Cicero to Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Italian philosophers have imagined the foundations of political science and republicanism. But it was Giuseppe Mazzini who revived the republican idea in Italy in the 19th century.\nAn Italian nationalist in the historical radical tradition and a proponent of a republicanism of social-democratic inspiration, Mazzini helped define the modern European movement for popular democracy in a republican state. Mazzini's thoughts had a very considerable influence on the Italian and European republican movements, in the Constitution of Italy, about Europeanism and more nuanced on many politicians of a later period, among them American president Woodrow Wilson, British prime minister David Lloyd George, Mahatma Gandhi, Israeli prime minister Golda Meir and Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Mazzini formulated a concept known as \"thought and action\" in which thought and action must be joined and every thought must be followed by action, therefore rejecting intellectualism and the notion of divorcing theory from practice.\nIn July 1831, in exile in Marseille, Giuseppe Mazzini founded the Young Italy movement, which aimed to transform Italy into a unitary democratic republic, according to the principles of freedom, independence and unity, but also to oust the monarchic regimes pre-existing the unification, including the Kingdom of Sardinia. The foundation of the Young Italy constitutes a key moment of the Italian Risorgimento and this republican program precedes in time the proposals for the unification of Italy of Vincenzo Gioberti and Cesare Balbo, aimed at reunifying the Italian territory under the presidency of the Pope. Subsequently, the philosopher Carlo Cattaneo promoted a secular and republican Italy in the extension of Mazzini's ideas, but organized as a federal republic.\nThe political projects of Mazzini and Cattaneo were thwarted by the action of the Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour, and Giuseppe Garibaldi. The latter set aside his republican ideas to favor Italian unity. After having obtained the conquest of the whole of southern Italy during the Expedition of the Thousand, Garibaldi handed over the conquered territories to the king of Sardinia Victor Emmanuel II, which were annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia after a plebiscite. This earned him heavy criticism from numerous republicans who accused him of treason. While a laborious administrative unification began, a first Italian parliament was elected and, on 17 March 1861, Victor Emmanuel II was proclaimed king of Italy.\nFrom 1861 to 1946, Italy was a constitutional monarchy founded on the Albertine Statute, named after the king who promulgated it in 1848, Charles Albert of Sardinia. The parliament included a Senate, whose members were appointed by the king, and a Chamber of Deputies, elected by census vote. In 1861 only 2% of Italians had the right to vote. In the political panorama of the time there was a republican political movement which had its martyrs, such as the soldier Pietro Barsanti. Barsanti was a supporter of republican ideas, and was a soldier in the Royal Italian Army with the rank of corporal. He was sentenced to death and shot in 1870 for having favored an insurrectional attempt against the Savoy monarchy and is therefore considered the first martyr of the modern Italian Republic and a symbol of republican ideals in Italy.\nAlbertine Statute and liberal Italy.\nThe balance of power between the Chamber and Senate initially shifted in favor of the Senate, composed mainly of nobles and industrial figures. Little by little, the Chamber of Deputies took on more and more importance with the evolution of the bourgeoisie and the large landowners, concerned with economic progress, but supporters of order and a certain social conservatism.\nThe Republicans took part in the elections to the Italian Parliament, and in 1853 they formed the Action Party around Giuseppe Mazzini. Although in exile, Mazzini was elected in 1866, but refused to take his seat in parliament. Carlo Cattaneo was elected deputy in 1860 and 1867, but refused so as not to have to swear loyalty to the House of Savoy. The problem of the oath of loyalty to the monarchy, necessary to be elected, was the subject of controversy within the republican forces. In 1873 Felice Cavallotti, one of the most committed Italian politicians against the monarchy, preceded his oath with a declaration in which he reaffirmed his republican beliefs. In 1882, a new electoral law lowered the census limit for voting rights, increasing the number of voters to over two million, equal to 7% of the population. In the same year the Italian Workers' Party was created, which in 1895 became the Italian Socialist Party. In 1895 the intransigent republicans agreed to participate in the political life of the Kingdom, establishing the Italian Republican Party. Two years later, the far left reached its historical maximum level in Parliament with 81 deputies, for the three radical-democratic, socialist components and Republican. With the death of Felice Cavallotti in 1898, the radical left gave up on posing the institutional problem.\nIn Italian politics, the socialist party progressively divided into two tendencies: a maximalist one, led among others by Arturo Labriola and Enrico Ferri, and supporting the use of strikes; the other, reformist and pro-government, was led by Filippo Turati. A nationalist movement emerged, led in particular by Enrico Corradini, as well as a Catholic social and democratic movement, the National Democratic League, led by Romolo Murri. In 1904, Pope Pius X authorized Catholics to participate individually in political life, but in 1909 he condemned the National Democratic League created by Romolo Murri, who was excommunicated. Finally, a law of 3 June 1912 marked Italy's evolution towards a certain political liberalism by establishing universal male suffrage. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, Italy began to be counted among the world's liberal democracies.\nFascism.\nAfter World War I, Italian political life was animated by four great movements. Two of these movements were in favor of democratic development within the framework of existing monarchical institutions: the reformist socialists and the Italian People's Party. Two other movements challenged these institutions: the Republican Party on the one hand, and the maximalist socialists. In the 1919 elections, the parties most imbued with republican ideology (the maximalist socialists and the Republican Party) won, obtaining 165 out of 508 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In the 1921 elections, after the foundation of the Italian Communist Party, the three parties republican, maximalist socialist and communist obtained 145 deputies out of 535. Overall, at the beginning of the interwar period, less than 30% of those elected were in favor of the establishment of a republican regime. In this context, the rise of Benito Mussolini's fascist movement was based on the bitterness generated by the \"mutilated victory\", the fear of social unrest and the rejection of revolutionary, republican and Marxist ideology. The liberal political system and part of the aristocracy chose to erect fascism as a bulwark against, in their way of seeing, these dangers.\nIn October 1922, the nomination of Benito Mussolini as prime minister by King Victor Emmanuel III, following the march on Rome, paved the way for the establishment of the dictatorship. The Albertine Statute was progressively emptied of its content. Parliament was subject to the will of the new government. The legal opposition disintegrated. On 27 June 1924, 127 deputies left Parliament and retreated to the Aventine Hill, a clumsy maneuver which, in effect, left the field open to the fascists. They then had the fate of Italy in their hands for two decades.\nNot only did Victor Emmanuel III appeal to Mussolini to form the government in 1922 and allow him to proceed with the domestication of Parliament, but he did not even draw the consequences of the assassination of Giacomo Matteotti in 1924. He accepted the title of emperor in 1936 at the end of Second Italo-Ethiopian War, then the alliance with Nazi Germany and Italy's entry into World War II on 10 June 1940.\nAnti-fascist parties in Italy and abroad.\nWith the implementation of fascist laws (Royal Decree of 6 November 1926), all political parties operating on Italian territory were dissolved, with the exception of the National Fascist Party. Some of these parties expatriated and reconstituted themselves abroad, especially in France. Thus an anti-fascist coalition was formed on 29 March 1927 in Paris, the \"Concentrazione Antifascista Italiana\", which brought together the Italian Republican Party, the Italian Socialist Party, the Socialist Unitary Party of Italian Workers, the Italian League for Human Rights and the foreign representation of the Italian General Confederation of Labour. Some movements remained outside, including the Italian Communist Party, the popular Catholic movement and other liberal movements. This coalition dissolved on 5 May 1934 and, in August of the same year, the pact of unity of action was signed between the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Communist Party.\nIn the meantime, in Italy, clandestine anti-fascist nuclei were formed, in particular in Milan with Ferruccio Parri and in Florence with Riccardo Bauer. Under the impetus of these groups, the Action Party, Mazzini's former republican party, was re-established. Between the end of 1942 and the beginning of 1943, Alcide De Gasperi wrote \"The reconstructive ideas of Christian Democracy\", which laid the foundations of the new Catholic-inspired party, the Christian Democracy. It brought together the veterans of Luigi Sturzo's Italian People's Party and the young people of Catholic associations, in particular of the University Federation.\nInstitutional crisis.\nOn 10 July 1943, the Allies landed in Sicily in Operation Husky. On 25 July 1943, Victor Emmanuel III revoked Mussolini's mandate as prime minister and had him arrested, entrusting the government to Marshal Pietro Badoglio. The new government contacted the Allies to reach an armistice. When the Armistice of Cassibile was announced on 8 September 1943, the Germans reacted by placing under their control all the part of Italian territory that still escaped the Allied advance and by disarming the Italian Royal Army. Victor Emmanuel III and Badoglio's government fled Rome and reached Brindisi, in southern Italy. The war continued, but was also accompanied by the Italian Civil War, with the creation by Mussolini of the Italian Social Republic, heavily dependent on the Germans, and by the division of Italy into two antagonistic territories, one occupied by the allied forces, the other occupied by Nazi Germany. In these dramatic circumstances, in the two territories the civil administration gave way to a military and police administration. However, the parties that existed before fascism were reconstituted, alongside new political parties.\nOn 9 September 1943, in Rome (still occupied by the Germans), a National Liberation Committee (CLN) was created, which brought together the parties and movements opposed to fascism and German occupation. It was made up of representatives of the Italian Communist Party, members of the Action Party, Christian Democrats, liberals, socialists and progressive democrats. The National Liberation Committee gave priority to the fight against the Nazi-fascists, postponing the question of the institutional form of the Italian state until after the victory, but made the abdication of the king in favor of his son a prerequisite for the establishment of an anti-fascist government. The patriotic war of liberation led by the National Liberation Committee was also, for a significant part of its supporters, a war of social liberation, a war against a collaborationist elite. However, the Americans and English, anxious to prepare for the post-war period, facilitated the entry into German-occupied territory of Italian democratic and republican activists aimed at counterbalancing the communist influence in the leadership of the National Liberation Committee. This was the case, for example, of Leo Valiani, future member of the triumvirate responsible for the partisan insurrection in Piedmont and Lombardy.\nInstitutional truce.\nOn 31 March 1944, in Salerno, Palmiro Togliatti, general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, called for the formation of a government of national unity and no longer required the king's abdication as a prerequisite. This declaration pushed the parties of the National Liberation Committee to rally around a compromise drawn up by Enrico De Nicola, president of the Chamber of Deputies until 1924, by Benedetto Croce of the liberal party and by the king's entourage. As foreseen in this agreement, upon the liberation of Rome, on 4 June 1944, Victor Emmanuel III proclaimed his son Umberto lieutenant general of the kingdom, and the parties took political control of the nation, even if the war continued, stabilizing on the front on the Gothic line until April 1945.\nFrom June 1944 to December 1945, three provisional coalition governments followed one another. The first was led by Ivanoe Bonomi, of the Labour Democratic Party. His government included the anti-fascist liberals Carlo Sforza and Benedetto Croce, as well as Palmiro Togliatti. Although temporarily put aside, the question of Italian institutions remained one of the main open political questions. Most of the forces supporting the National Liberation Committee were openly republicans and believed that the monarchy, in particular Victor Emmanuel III, had had a responsibility in the success of the fascist movement. The final agreement between the parties was to ask that at the end of the war, as soon as conditions were favourable, the calling of elections, an institutional referendum and the formation of a constituent assembly. Until then, on 31 January 1945, the Council of Ministers, chaired by Ivanoe Bonomi, issued a decree which recognized women's right to vote. Universal suffrage was thus recognized, after the vain attempts made in 1881 and 1907 by women of the various parties.\nThe Bonomi governments (II then III) were succeeded by the Parri government in June 1945, then by the First De Gasperi government in December 1945. The question of the future form of the state, monarchy or republic, absorbed the minds of political circles. The majority of Christian Democratic activists, especially young people, increasingly distanced themselves from the monarchy. During the local meetings of the leaders of this party, in Rome and Milan, motions were presented aimed at making official a political line favorable to a democratic republic. The central political office tried to curb these pressures and maintain an intermediate position.\nOrganization.\nOn 16 March 1946, Prince Umberto decreed, as expected in 1944, that the question of the institutional form of the state would be decided by a referendum organized simultaneously with the election of a constituent assembly. The date was set for 2 June 1946. The Supreme Court of Cassation was responsible for examining the appeals. Its role was to be limited to observing the progress of voting operations and consolidating the bulletins issued by the offices that communicated the results in each constituency. The counting of the ballots of the candidates for the constituent assembly had to precede that of the referendum. If the monarchy had won, it would have been the Constituent Assembly that would have had to choose the head of state.\nAbdication and departure of King Victor Emmanuel III.\nWanted by the Allies to verify that the conditions existed for voting in a country torn apart by the civil war only a few months earlier, partial municipal and provincial elections were held in March and April 1946 in half of the Italian municipalities and provinces. These elections, which mainly involved left-wing cities, brought out three parties, with a clear advantage for the Christian Democrats, led by Alcide De Gasperi, which exceeded the sum of votes cast for the Italian Communist Party and the Italian Socialist Party. After these administrative elections, the monarchists, already worried about the outcome of the referendum, became even more discouraged.\nBut a political event changed the situation during the referendum campaign. A month before the referendum, Victor Emmanuel III abdicated in favor of his son Umberto, who was proclaimed king and took the name Umberto II. The act of abdication, drawn up privately, is dated 9 May 1946. This abdication was desired by the monarchists, since the crown prince was less compromised than his father in Mussolini's rise to power and in coexistence with the fascist forces. It is also possible that the command of the allied forces present on Italian territory encouraged the sovereign to abdicate in favor of his son. The former king immediately left Italy for Alexandria in Egypt. Umberto II confirmed his promise to respect the popular decision regarding the referendum. The representatives of the parties in favor of the Republic protested, arguing the assumption of royal powers by the lieutenant general conflicted with an article of the legislative decree of 16 March 1946 that aimed at guaranteeing institutional stability before the announcement of the results. For observers, the gap between republicans and monarchists was narrowing, which increased tension in the final phase of the electoral campaign. In fact, some scuffles broke out between activists of the two sides in the tense climate.\nResults.\nThe vote for the choice between monarchy or republic took place on 2 June and on the morning of 3 June 1946. After the transfer of the electoral cards from all of Italy and the minutes of the 31 constituencies to Rome, the results were expected on 8 June. On 10 June, the still provisional results were announced, and the final ones were communicated later due to missing data in some polling stations and after the examination of numerous appeals regarding the contested referendum ballots. In fact, 21,000 disputes occurred over the referendum ballots, most of which were quickly resolved. However, the period of uncertainty between the end of the vote and the final official announcement of the results only strengthened tensions in the country. In the city of Naples, in Apulia, in Calabria and in Sicily, the monarchists carried out protest demonstrations, sometimes violent. On 7 June, a monarchist student, soon transformed into a martyr, was killed.\nOne of the complaints submitted to the Supreme Court of Cassation is particularly delicate. This controversy was over the definition of \"majority\". The monarchists believed that it was necessary to take into account not the majority of votes cast, but the \"majority of electors\", as an article of the electoral law provided. The public prosecutor of the Supreme Court of Cassation, Massimo Pilotti, deemed this appeal admissible. In his indictment Pilotti believed that the spirit and letter of the decrees as well as jurisprudence provide for the counting of voters, without excluding blank or invalid ballots. But the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled against him, with 12 votes against to 7. On the one hand, it was believed that the vote, as a legal act, manifested a will and that the blank or null vote could be assimilated to the absence of expression of will. The Supreme Court of Cassation also identified another decree which specified that only \"validly cast\" votes should be preserved. The Supreme Court of Cassation finally announced that no law or decree dealt with the need for an absolute majority.\nThe final results were announced on 18 June 1946. Voter turnout was 89%, with 54% of the votes cast for the republic and 46% for the monarchy. The analysis of the data by region showed an Italy practically divided in two: in the north the republic won with 66% of the votes cast, and the monarchy in the south with 64% of the votes.\nThe supporters of the republic chose the effigy of the \"Italia turrita\", the national personification of Italy, as their unitary symbol to be used in the electoral campaign and on the referendum ballot on the institutional form of the State, in contrast to the Savoy coat of arms, which represented the monarchy. This triggered various controversies, given that the iconography of the allegorical personification of Italy had, and still has, a universal and unifying meaning that should have been common to all Italians and not only to a part of them: this was the last appearance in the institutional context of \"Italia turrita\".\nHowever, some voters were unable to vote. Before the closure of the electoral lists in April 1945, many Italian soldiers were still outside the national territory, in detention or internment camps abroad. Citizens of the provinces of Bolzano, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume and Zara, located in territories not administered by the Italian government but by the Allied authorities, which were still under occupation pending a final settlement of the status of the territories (in fact in 1947 most of these territories were then annexed by Yugoslavia after the Paris peace treaties of 1947, such as most of the Julian March and the province of Zara). These provinces, however, were all located in the north of the country, an area where the Republican vote obtained a fairly large majority.\nBy district.\nThe conservative, rural \"Mezzogiorno\" (southern Italy) region voted solidly for the monarchy (63.8%) while the more urbanised and industrialised \"Nord\" (northern Italy) voted equally firmly for a republic (66.2%).\nProvinces excluded from voting.\nThe referendum was not held in the Julian March, in the province of Zara or the province of Bolzano, which were still under occupation by Allied forces pending a final settlement of the status of the territories.\nResults of the Constituent Assembly elections.\nThe distribution of votes is as follows:\nAnalysis of voting results.\nAt first glance, the referendum seemed to simply divide Italy in two, between North and South, but the situation was more complex. For example, the districts located to the north of Rome gave the majority to the republic, while those located to the south chose the monarchy. The electoral college of Rome was very divided and gave a slight majority to the choice of the monarchic regime. The Republican choice turned into a plebiscite, with over 80% of the votes cast in the electoral college of Bologna, and even more in that of Trento. In the South, however, the monarchist choice reached nearly 80% in the college of Naples. But, in other regions, the vote was very fragmented. There was not a total break with the past, but an interference between the two possible choices, which was expressed everywhere.\nThe occupation of the North by the German forces and the period of the Italian Civil War, with the fascist forces, undoubtedly favored an increase in the importance of the socialist and communist parties in this region, which were republican in tendency. During these dark years, the populations concerned placed part of their hopes in dreams of revolution, or at least of change. The South, not having experienced this situation and having welcomed King Victor Emmanuel III and his government, was perhaps more wary of these parties and placed its trust in the monarchic regime, preferring continuity to the \"leap into the unknown\" represented by the republican form. Furthermore, the clientelism prevalent in the South favored a vote that tended to be conservative, and therefore monarchist. Some analysts also cite the influence of the Catholic Church or the Catholic press. Other authors have highlighted more structural factors, such as differences in family organization or production by region. Thus Carlo Bacetti compared, in Tuscany, the importance of metayage in the organization of work on the land, and the weight of the Communist Party in this region, which had republican tendencies.\nAftermath.\nFirst results and events in Naples.\nOn 10 June, at 6 pm, in the Sala della Lupa (\"Hall of the Wolf\"), which owes its name to the presence of a bronze sculpture of the Capitoline Wolf, of Palazzo Montecitorio in Rome, the Supreme Court of Cassation read out the partial results of the referendum, postponing the definitive proclamation of the results to Parliament for 18 June, after having taken the relevant decisions on appeals, protests and complaints. At the same time, republican demonstrations took place in many cities. The Milanese newspaper, , on Tuesday 11 June, ran the headline: \"The Italian Republic is born\". \"La Stampa\", a Turin daily newspaper, declared more soberly: \"The government confirms the victory of the republicans\", and completed its coverage by asking: \"the question is whether the republic has been proclaimed or not\".\nIn Naples, a city with a population largely supportive of the monarchy, an incident occurred on 11 June. A procession of supporters of the monarchy advanced towards the municipal buildings and then changed objective and headed towards the headquarters of the Italian Communist Party. The crowd saw a red flag, but also a tricolor flag from which the royal coat of arms had been cut. Despite the presence of armored vehicles, the demonstrators attempted to storm the communist party headquarters. Protesters and law enforcement officers exchange gunfire. According to the prefect's report, the demonstrators shot first. In any case the response was deadly, with machine gun fire. There were nine deaths among royalist demonstrators and a large number of injuries. Calm returned to the city only on 13 June.\nThe protests of the monarchists, like those bloodily repressed the day before in Naples and a new monarchist demonstration dispersed on 12 June, aroused the concerns of the ministers intending to establish the Republic as soon as possible (according to the famous phrase of the socialist leader Pietro Nenni: \"either the Republic or chaos!\").\nEarly establishment of the republic and departure of the former king.\nOn the night of 12 June the government met at Alcide De Gasperi's invitation. The Prime Minister received a written communication from the King, in which he said he was ready to respect the verdict of the electors' vote, but adding that he would await the final declaration of the Supreme Court of Cassation. The letter and the protests of the monarchists, like the bloody events of the day before in Naples, as well as the new demonstrations announced by the monarchists worried the ministers.\nOn 13 June, the Council of Ministers, extending the meeting begun the previous day, resolved that, following the proclamation of the provisional results on 10 June, the functions of provisional head of state would be exercised by Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi, without wait for the final official confirmation from the Court of Cassation. The Prime Minister collected all the votes of the government members, with the exception of the liberal minister Leone Cattani.\nAlthough some members of his entourage encouraged him to oppose this decision, the king, informed, decided to leave the country the following day, thus making a peaceful transfer of power possible, not without having denounced De Gasperi's \"revolutionary gesture\".\nThe former King of Italy, Umberto II, decided to leave Italy on 13 June, without even waiting for the results to be defined and the ruling on the appeals presented by the monarchist party, to avoid the clashes between monarchists and republicans, already manifested in bloody events in various Italian cities, for fear they could extend throughout the country. He went into exile in Cascais, Portugal.\nChanging the national flag and the national anthem.\nOn the same day as the former king's departure, the flag of Italy with the Savoy coat of arms in the centre was lowered from the Quirinal Palace. The Italian flag was modified with the decree of the president of the Council of Ministers No. 1 of 19 June 1946. Compared to the monarchic banner, the Savoy coat of arms was eliminated. This decision was later confirmed in the session of 24 March 1947 by the Constituent Assembly, which decreed the insertion of article 12 of the Italian Constitution, subsequently ratified by the Italian Parliament, which states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\u2014\u200a\nThe Republican tricolour was then officially and solemnly delivered to the Italian military corps on 4 November 1947 on the occasion of National Unity and Armed Forces Day. The universally adopted ratio is 2:3, while the war flag is squared (1:1). Each \"comune\" also has a \"gonfalone\" bearing its coat of arms. On 27 May 1949, a law was passed that described and regulated the way the flag was displayed outside public buildings and during national holidays.\nAfter the birth of the Italian Republic, \"La leggenda del Piave\" was temporarily chosen as the provisional national anthem, which replaced \"Marcia Reale\", the national anthem of the Kingdom of Italy. For the choice of the national anthem a debate was opened which identified, among the possible options: the \"Va, pensiero\" from Giuseppe Verdi's \"Nabucco\", the drafting of a completely new musical piece, \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", the \"Inno di Garibaldi\" and the confirmation of \"La Leggenda del Piave\". The political class of the time then approved the proposal of the War Minister Cipriano Facchinetti, who foresaw the adoption of \"Il Canto degli Italiani\" as a provisional anthem of the State.\n\"La Leggenda del Piave\" then had the function of the national anthem of the Italian Republic until the Council of Ministers of 12 October 1946, when Cipriano Facchinetti (of republican political belief), officially announced that during the celebrations of 4 November for National Unity and Armed Forces Day, in which the armed services of the republic will perform their oath of loyalty to the young republic, as a provisional anthem, \"Il Canto degli Italiani\" would have been adopted. The press release stated that:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;... On the proposal of the Minister of War it was established that the oath of the Armed Forces to the Republic and to its Chief would be carried out on November 4th p.v. and that, temporarily, the anthem of Mameli is adopted as the national anthem ...\u2014\u200a\n\"Il Canto degli Italiani\" was therefore chosen, on 12 October 1946, as the provisional national anthem, a role that it later preserved while remaining the de facto anthem of the Italian Republic. Over the decades there were several unsuccessful attempts to make it the official national anthem, until it finally gained official status on 4 December 2017.\nFinal announcement of results and first steps of the Italian Republic.\nOn 18 June 1946 at 6 pm, in the Sala della Lupa of Palazzo Montecitorio in Rome, the Supreme Court of Cassation proceeded to proclaim the results of the referendum, without accompanying this formalization with reservations as it had done previously. Many years later, in 1960, the president of this Court, Giuseppe Pagano, declared that the law establishing the organization of the referendum was incompatible with the slowness of the counting and the very unequal transmission of the minutes, not giving the Court time to complete all investigations.\nIn the first session of the Constituent Assembly, on 28 June 1946, Enrico De Nicola was elected provisional head of the State, in the first round with 396 votes out of 501. In addition to his personal qualities, the choice of a man born in Naples and long monarchic history, it was a sign of pacification and union towards the populations of southern Italy, in this accelerated transition towards the Republic. He was initially only provisional head of state and not president of Italy, since the latter did not yet have a constitution. Alcide De Gasperi resigned and then regained the task of forming a new government, thus becoming the last Prime Minister of the monarchic era and the first of republican Italy.\nOn 1 January 1948, the Republican Constitution came into force, the content of which was discussed within the Constituent Assembly. It proclaims in particular that \"Italy is a democratic republic founded on labour\" and that \"the former kings of the House of Savoy, their wives and their male descendants are prohibited from entering and staying in the national territory\". Enrico De Nicola then assumed the title of President of Italy. The validity of the provision that prohibited the entry in Italy of some members of the House of Savoy ceased with the entry into force of the Constitutional Law of 23 October 2002, No. 1, after a debate in parliament and in the country that lasted many years and Vittorio Emanuele, Prince of Naples, son of King Umberto II, was able to enter Italy with his family already in the following December for a short visit. The former queen Marie-Jos\u00e9 had already been authorized to return to Italy in 1987 since, with the death of her husband Umberto II and having become a widow, her status as \"spouse\" was recognized as having ceased.\nThe symbolic photo of the birth of the Republic.\nThe photo, which later became a \"symbol\" of the celebrations for the outcome of the referendum, portrays the face of a young woman emerging from a copy of \"Il Corriere della Sera\" of 6 June 1946 with the title \u00ab\"\u00c8 nata la Repubblica Italiana\"\u00bb (\"The Italian Republic is born\").\nThe symbolic photo of the birth of the Republic was taken by Federico Patellani for the weekly \"Tempo\" (n. 22, 15\u201322 June 1946) as part of a photo shoot celebrating the Republic and the new role of women; it was also featured on the front page of the \"Il Corriere della Sera\" itself and was later reused in many campaigns and posters.\nOnly in 2016 was the woman identified as Anna Iberti (1922\u20131997).\n\"Festa della Repubblica\".\n\"Festa della Repubblica\" (; English: \"Republic Day\") is the Italian National Day and Republic Day, which is celebrated on 2 June each year, with the main celebration taking place in Rome. The \"Festa della Repubblica\" is one of the national symbols of Italy. The day commemorates the institutional referendum held by universal suffrage in 1946, in which the Italian people were called to the polls to decide on the form of government following World War II and the fall of Fascism, monarchy or republic. On 2 June the birth of the modern Italian Republic is celebrated in a similar way to the French 14 July (anniversary of the storming of the Bastille) and to 4 July in the United States (anniversary of the declaration of independence from Great Britain). The first celebration of the \"Festa della Repubblica\" took place on 2 June 1947, while in 1948 there was the first military parade in Via dei Fori Imperiali in Rome; 2 June was definitively declared a national holiday in 1949.\nThe official ceremony of the Rome celebration includes the solemn flag-raising ceremony at the Altare della Patria and the tribute to the Italian Unknown Soldier with the deposition of a laurel wreath by the President of Italy in the presence of the most important officers of the State, or of the President of the Senate, the President of the Chamber of Deputies, the President of the Council of Ministers, the President of the Constitutional Court, the Minister of Defense and the Chief of Defense. After the playing of the National Anthem \"Il Canto degli Italiani\", the Frecce Tricolori cross the skies of Rome.\nFollowing the ceremony the President is then driven to Via di San Gregorio with the presidential Lancia Flaminia escorted by a patrol group of Corazzieri on a motorcycle where, together with the military commander of the capital garrison, usually a Major General, he reviews the parade formations presenting arms as the bands play their service or inspection marches. The Head of State then processes to the presidential tribune which is located in Via dei Fori Imperiali, gets down the vehicle, and processes there to meet other dignitaries and as he arrives in his spot in the dais the Corazzieri's mounted troopers, which had provided the rear escort during the review phrase, salute the President as the anthem is played. It is tradition, for the members of the Italian government and for the presidents of the two chambers of parliament, to have pinned on their jacket, during the whole ceremony, an Italian tricolor cockade. Following the anthem, the military parade begins, which the ground columns of military personnel saluting the President with eyes left or right with their colours dipped as they march past the dais. Mobile column crew contingent colour guards perform the salute in a like manner. The military parade also includes some military delegations from the United Nations, NATO, the European Union and representatives of multinational departments with an Italian component.\nOn the holiday, at the Quirinale Palace, the Changing of the Guard with the Corazzieri Regiment and the Fanfare of the Carabinieri Cavalry Regiment in high uniform is carried out in solemn form. This solemn rite is only performed on two other occasions, during the celebrations of the Tricolour Day (7 January) and the National Unity and Armed Forces Day (4 November). Official ceremonies are held throughout the national territory. Among them are the traditional receptions organized by each prefecture for the local authorities, which are preceded by solemn public demonstrations with reduced military parades that have been reviewed by the prefect in his capacity as the highest governmental authority in the province. Similar ceremonies are also organized by the Regions and Municipalities. All over the world, Italian embassies organize ceremonies to which the Heads of State of the host country are invited. Greetings from the other Heads of State reach the President of Italy from all over the world.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The family contains approximately 85 species in two genera, \"Alangium\" and \"Cornus\". They are mostly trees and shrubs, which may be deciduous or evergreen, although a few species are perennial herbs. Members of the family usually have opposite or alternate simple leaves, four- or five-parted flowers clustered in inflorescences or pseudanthia, and drupaceous fruits. The family is primarily distributed in northern temperate regions and tropical Asia. In northern temperate areas, Cornaceae are well known from the dogwoods \"Cornus\".\nThe systematics of Cornaceae has been remarkably unsettled and controversial, and many genera have been added to it and removed from it over time. (One researcher called it a \"dustbin\".) Molecular phylogenetics have clarified the relatedness of some associated genera, and at least nine genera that were previously included in Cornaceae have been eliminated from the order Cornales entirely, but the circumscription of Cornaceae is still unclear. The Angiosperm Phylogeny Group usually defines Cornaceae as comprising the genera \"Cornus\" and \"Alangium\" as well as five genera now separated into the family Nyssaceae. However, many of these genera are sometimes split off into their own families (e.g. Alangiaceae), and the usage remains inconsistent.\nFossil record.\nThe oldest fossil that can be related to Cornaceae is \u2020\"Hironoia fusiformis\", an extinct taxon collected from the Futaba Group sediments at Kamitikaba, Japan. Synapomorphies of the fruits of the fossil occur also in extant Cornaceae. The age of the sediments is of early Coniacian to early Santonian (about 88 Ma). Although the mosaic of characters in \"Hironoia\" precludes assignment to an extant genus, the fiber rather than sclereid composition of the fruit places it within the Nyssaceae-Mastixiaceae. Other possible Cornaceae from Cretaceous sediments include endocarps resembling Cornus from the Santonian-Campanian mesofossil\nassemblage of \u00c5sen.

{"id": "67717", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67717", "title": "American robin", "text": "Species of bird\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory bird of the true thrush genus and Turdidae, the wider thrush family. It is named after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific coast.\nAccording to the Partners in Flight database (2019), the American robin is the most abundant landbird in North America (with 370million individuals), ahead of red-winged blackbirds, introduced European starlings, mourning doves and house finches. It has seven subspecies.\nThe species is active mostly during the day and assembles in large flocks at night. Its diet consists of invertebrates (such as beetle grubs, earthworms, and caterpillars), fruits, and berries. It is one of the earliest bird species to lay its eggs, beginning to breed shortly after returning to its summer range from its winter range. The robin's nest consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers, and is smeared with mud and often cushioned with grass or other soft materials. It is among the earliest birds to sing at dawn, and its song consists of several discrete units that are repeated.\nThe adult's main predator is the domestic cat; other predators include hawks and snakes. When feeding in flocks, it can be vigilant, watching other birds for reactions to predators. Brown-headed cowbirds (\"Molothrus ater\") lay their eggs in robin nests (see brood parasite), but the robins usually reject the egg.\nTaxonomy.\nThis species was first described in 1766 by Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his \"Systema Naturae\" as \"Turdus migratorius\". The binomial name derives from two Latin words: \"turdus\", \"thrush\", and \"migratorius\" from \"migrare\" \"to migrate\". The term \"robin\" for this species has been recorded since at least 1703. \nA 2020 genetic study has shown that the American robin is closest to the rufous-collared thrush (\"T. rufitorques\") of Central America, confirming a 2007 study which also placed this as its closest relative. Though having distinct plumage, the two species are similar in vocalization and behavior. Beyond this, it lies in a group of other Central American thrushes, suggesting a recent spread northwards into North America; the 2007 study suggested rufous-backed thrush (\"T. rufopalliatus\"; not included in the 2020 study) as the next closest relative, with both studies giving the next-closest relatives beyond this trio as the species pair of black thrush (\"T. infuscatus\") and sooty thrush (\"T. nigrescens\"), also of Central America.\nThese results contrast markedly with two older studies of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene which had suggested, though only with weak support, that the American robin might be more closely related to the Kurrichane thrush (\"T. libonyanus\") and the olive thrush (\"T. olivaceus\"), both African species, rather than other American thrushes.\nSubspecies.\nSeven subspecies are accepted. These, except for the isolated \"T. m. confinis\", intergrade with each other and are only weakly defined.\nDescription.\nThe eastern subspecies (\"T. m. migratorius\") is long with a wingspan ranging from , with similar size ranges across all subspecies. The species averages about in weight, with males ranging from and females ranging from . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the culmen is and the tarsus is . The head varies from jet black to gray, with white eye arcs and white supercilia. The throat is white with black streaks, and the belly and undertail coverts are white. The adult has a brown back and a reddish-orange breast, varying from a rich red maroon to peachy orange. The bill is mainly yellow with a variably dark tip, the dusky area becoming more extensive in winter, and the legs and feet are brown.\nThe sexes are similar, but females tend to be duller in color than males, with a brown tint to the head, brown upperparts, and less-bright underparts. However, some birds cannot be accurately sexed on the sole basis of plumage. Juveniles are paler in color than adult males and have dark spots on their breasts and whitish wing coverts. First-year birds are not easily distinguishable from adults, but they tend to be duller, with first-year males resembling adult females, and a small percentage retain a few juvenile wing coverts or other feathers.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe species breeds throughout most of North America, from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico. While robins occasionally overwinter in the northern part of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from Florida and the Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates vary with latitude and climate). The distance by which they migrate varies significantly depending on their initial habitat; a study found that individual robins tagged in Alaska are known to travel as much as 3.5 times further across seasons than robins tagged in Massachusetts.\nThe species is a rare vagrant to western Europe, where the majority of records have been in Great Britain, where 29 had been recorded up to the end of 2022. The species has occurred as a vagrant to Greenland, Sweden, Jamaica, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico and Belize. Vagrants to Europe, where identified to subspecies, are the eastern subspecies (\"T. m. migratorius\"), but the Greenland birds included the Newfoundland subspecies (\"T. m. nigrideus\"), and some of the southern overshots may have been the southern subspecies (\"T. m. achrusterus\").\nThe breeding habitat is woodland and more open farmland and urban areas. It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost part of the Deep South of the United States and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.\nDiseases.\nThe species is a known reservoir (carrier) for West Nile virus spread by \"Culex\" mosquitoes. While crows and jays are often the first noticed deaths in an area with West Nile virus, the American robin is suspected to be a key host and holds a larger responsibility for the transmission of the virus to humans. This is because, while crows and jays die quickly from the virus, the American robin survives the virus longer, hence spreading it to more mosquitoes, which then transmit the virus to humans and other species.\nA successful West Nile virus vaccine has been administered to six 3-5 week old American robins. A DNA vaccine injected intramuscularly resulted in a 400-fold decrease in average viral load that would likely make robins noninfectious and unable to spread disease. An oral bait is the preferred method of distribution of the vaccine as it would be easier and cheaper than intramuscular injection, but more research would be needed as the existing formulation did not work orally.\nBehavior.\nThe American robin is active mostly during the day, and on its winter grounds, it assembles in large flocks at night to roost in trees in secluded swamps or dense vegetation. The flocks break up during the day when the birds feed on fruits and berries in smaller groups. During the summer, males defend a breeding territory and are less social.\nDiet.\nThe diet generally consists of around 40 percent small invertebrates (mainly insects), such as earthworms, beetle grubs, caterpillars, and grasshoppers, and 60 percent wild and cultivated fruits and berries. Their ability to switch to berries allows them to winter much farther north than most other North American thrushes. They will flock to fermented \"Pyracantha\" berries, and after eating sufficient quantities will exhibit intoxicated behavior, such as falling over while walking. Robins forage primarily on the ground for soft-bodied invertebrates, and find worms by sight (and sometimes by hearing), pouncing on them and then pulling them up. Nestlings are fed mainly on earthworms and other soft-bodied animal prey. In some areas, robins, particularly of the northwestern subspecies (\"T. m. caurinus\"), will feed on beaches, taking insects and small mollusks. American robins are common pests of fruit orchards in North America. Due to their insectivorous and frugivorous diet they have evolved to lose sucrase. Sucrose is unpalatable to them and can be used by humans as a deterrent.\nThe species uses auditory, visual, olfactory and possibly vibrotactile cues to find prey, but vision is the predominant mode of prey detection. It is frequently seen running across lawns picking up earthworms, and its \"running and stopping\" behavior is a distinguishing characteristic. In addition to hunting visually, it also has the ability to hunt by hearing. Experiments have shown that it can find earthworms underground by simply using its listening skills. It typically will take several short hops and then cock its head left, right or forward to detect movement of its prey. In urban areas, robins will gather in numbers soon after lawns are mowed or where sprinklers are in use.\nThreats.\nJuveniles and eggs are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds. Adults are primarily taken by \"Accipiter\" hawks, cats, and larger snakes such as rat snakes and gopher snakes. Canids such as foxes and dogs take fledglings from the ground. Raccoons often prey upon nests, while small agile carnivores such as American martens, ring-tailed cats and long-tailed weasels hunt adults. The greatest predatory impact is probably from raptorial birds. 28 raptorial bird species hunt American robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable while breeding activities, whereas feeding flocks are vigilant for predators.\nThe American robin rejects cowbird eggs, so brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird is rare, and the parasite's chick does not often survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with endoparasites, \"Syngamus\" sp. being the most commonly encountered, in 57.1% of the birds.\nBreeding.\nBreeding begins shortly after the returning to the summer range. The species is one of the first North American birds to lay eggs, and normally has two to three broods per breeding season, which lasts from April to July.\nThe nest is most commonly located above the ground in a dense bush or in a fork between two tree branches, and is built by the female alone. The outer foundation consists of long coarse grass, twigs, paper, and feathers. This is lined with smeared mud and cushioned with fine grass or other soft materials. The American robin builds a new nest for each brood; in northern areas the nest for the first clutch will usually be located in an evergreen tree or shrub, while later broods are raised in deciduous trees. The species is not shy about nesting close to human habitations.\nA clutch consists of three to five cyan-colored eggs, and is incubated by the female alone. The eggs hatch after 14\u00a0days, and the chicks leave the nest a further two weeks later. The altricial chicks are naked and have their eyes closed for the first few days after hatching.\nThe chicks are fed earthworms, insects, and berries. Waste accumulation does not occur in the nest because the adults collect and take it away. Chicks are fed, and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging. Chicks become sexually mature at one year of age. Bird banders have found that only 25% of young robins survive their first year. The longest known lifespan of an American robin in the wild is 14\u00a0years; the average lifespan is about two years.\nVocalization.\nThe male, as with many thrushes, has a complex and almost continuous song. It is commonly described as a \"cheery\" carol, made up of discrete units, often repeated, and spliced together into a string with brief pauses in between. The song varies regionally, and its style varies by the time of day. The song period is from late February or early March to late July or early August; some birds, particularly in the east, sing occasionally into September or later. They are often among the first songbirds to sing as dawn rises or hours before, and last as evening sets in. It usually sings from a high perch in a tree. The song of the San Lucas subspecies (\"T. m. confinis\") is weaker than that of the eastern subspecies (\"T. m. migratorius\"), and lacks any clear notes.\nIn addition to its song, the species has a number of calls used for communicating specific information, such as when a ground predator approaches and when a nest or another American robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when they exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to drive away a predator.\nConservation status.\nThe species has an extensive range, estimated at , and a large population of about 370\u00a0million individuals. The western subspecies (\"T. m. propinquus\") in central California is considered to be expanding its range, as is likely the case elsewhere in the United States. It is threatened by climate change and severe weather, but the population trend appears to be stable, and the species does not approach the vulnerable species thresholds under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations), and therefore International Union for Conservation of Nature evaluated it as least concern. At one point, the bird was killed for its meat, but it is now protected throughout its range in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.\nIn culture.\nThe American robin is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. It was depicted on the 1986 Birds of Canada series Canadian $2 note (this note was subsequently withdrawn.) It has a place in Native American mythology. The story of how the robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that surround the European robin. The Tlingit people of northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. The Peace Bridge robins were a family of American robins that attracted minor publicity in the mid-1930s for their prominent nest on the Canadian side of the Peace Bridge connecting Buffalo, New York, to Fort Erie, Ontario.\nAmerican popular songs featuring this bird include \"When the Red, Red Robin (Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along)\", written by Harry M. Woods. Although the comic book superhero Robin was inspired by an N. C. Wyeth illustration of Robin Hood, a later version had his mother nicknaming him Robin because he was born on the first day of spring.\nThe species is considered a symbol of spring. A well-known example is a poem by Emily Dickinson titled \"I Dreaded That First Robin So\". Among other 19th-century poems about the first robin of spring is \"The First Robin\" by William Henry Drummond, which, according to the author's wife, is based on a Quebec superstition that whoever sees the first robin of spring will have good luck. The association has continued down to the present day, as, for example, in one \"Calvin and Hobbes\" cartoon from 1990 that had Calvin celebrating his inevitable wealth and fame after seeing the first robin of spring. The harbinger of spring sobriquet is borne out by the fact that American robins tend to follow the isotherm north in spring, but also south in fall. In a study of 209 psychology students at the University of California, Berkeley, Eleanor Rosch found that the robin was, in the students' minds, the most prototypical example of a bird (though the students did not have the opportunity to specify the species of robin). \"Robin egg blue\" is a color named after the color of the bird's eggs.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is run at Epsom Downs Racecourse in Surrey on the first Saturday of June each year, over a distance of one mile, four furlongs and 10 yards (2,423 metres) or about 1\u00bd miles. It was first run in 1780.\nIt is Britain's richest flat horse race and the most prestigious of the five Classics. It is sometimes referred to as the \"Blue Riband\" of the turf. The race serves as the middle leg of the historically significant Triple Crown of British horse racing, preceded by the 2000 Guineas and followed by the St\u00a0Leger, although the feat of winning all three is rarely attempted in the modern era due to changing priorities in racing and breeding, and the demands it places on horses.\nThe name \"Derby\" (deriving from the sponsorship of the Earl of Derby) has been borrowed many times, notably by the Kentucky Derby in the United States, and to describe many other key racing and sporting events. The term \"Epsom Derby\" is often used in the United States and elsewhere, in order to differentiate the Derby from other races such as the Irish Derby or French Derby. The Derby run at Epsom is usually referred to as \"the Derby\" in Great Britain. It is one of Britain's great national sporting events and has a large worldwide TV audience.\nHistory.\nThe Stanley family, Earls of Derby, had a long history of horse-racing, and James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, who gained the Lordship of Mann in 1627, instituted horse-racing on the Langness Peninsula on the Isle of Man, donating a cup for what became known as the \"Manx Derby\".\nThe Derby originated at a celebration following the first running of the Oaks Stakes in 1779. A new race was planned, and it was decided that it should be named after either the host of the party, the 12th Earl of Derby, or one of his guests, Sir Charles Bunbury (the Bunbury Cup run at Newmarket would later be named in his honour). According to legend the decision was made by the toss of a coin, but it is probable that Bunbury, the Steward of the Jockey Club, deferred to his host. The inaugural running of the Derby was held on Thursday 4 May 1780. It was won by Diomed, a colt owned by Sir Charles Bunbury, who collected prize money of \u00a31,065 15s. The first four runnings were contested over the last mile of the old Orbicular course &lt;49&gt;, this extended in line with the Oaks to the current distance of 1\u00bd miles in 1784. Lord Derby achieved his first success in the event in 1787, with a horse called Sir Peter Teazle.\nThe starting point of the race was moved twice during the 19th century. The first move, suggested by Lord George Bentinck, was in 1848, and the second was in 1872. It was discovered in 1991 that the exact length of the race was one mile, four furlongs and 10 yards.\nInitially, the Derby was run on a Thursday in late May or early June, depending on when Easter occurred. In 1838 the race was moved to a Wednesday to fit in with the railways' timetables, but still followed the moveable feast of Easter. In the 20th century, the race was run mainly on a Wednesday in late May or early June until 1994, after which it was changed to a Saturday in early June. From 1915 to 1918 (during World War I), it was on a Tuesday, with the race's latest ever date being 31 July 1917. From 1942 to 1945 (during World War II), 1947 to 1950, and in 1953, the race was run on a Saturday. From 1969 to 1994, it was on the first Wednesday in June. From 2003 to at least 2022, it has been on the first Saturday in June, apart from a race on 4 July 2020 without spectators, owing to COVID-19.\nThe Derby has been run at Epsom in all years except during the world wars; from 1915 to 1918 and from 1940 to 1945, the Derby was run at Newmarket as the 'New Derby'.\nWith the race's close association with gambling, the most controversial running of the Epsom Derby took place in 1844. The winner, Running Rein, was disqualified on discovery that a four-year-old imposter, a horse by the name Maccabeus, had been substituted in his place as part of a betting coup.\nThe Derby has inspired many similar events around the world. European variations include the Irish Derby, the Prix du Jockey Club (often known as the \"French Derby\"), Derby Italiano and the Deutsches Derby. Several races in the United States include the \"Derby\" name, including the oldest, the Kentucky Derby. Other national equivalents include the Australian Derby, the New Zealand Derby, the Japanese Derby and the Romanian Derby.\nIn 1931, the Derby became the world's first outdoor sporting event to be televised.\nThere is a maximum of 20 runners allowed in the race.\nSince 1993, the Derby has introduced the option of yearling entry.\nEpsom Fair.\nFor many years the Derby was run on a Wednesday or a Thursday and on the day huge crowds would come from London, not only to see the race but to enjoy other entertainment (during some of the 19th century and most of the 20th, Parliament would adjourn to allow members to attend the meeting).\nBy the time that Charles Dickens visited Epsom Downs to view the race in the 1850s, entertainers such as musicians, clowns, and conjurers plied their trades and entertained the crowds; other forms of entertainment included coconut stalls. The crowded meeting was the subject of a painting by William Powell Frith painted in the 1858 and titled \"The Derby Day\"; critics have noted that the foreground of the painting features the entertainment attractions, while the racing is relegated to the margins.\nIn the 1870s, the steam-driven rides were introduced. They were located at the Tattenham Corner end of the grounds and the fair was on for ten days and entertained hundreds of thousands. During the latter half of the 20th century, Derby Day became less popular and the race was moved from Wednesday to Saturday in 1995 with the hope of reviving high attendance. As the number of people attending the fair dwindled in the face of competition for attention and changing tastes, its length was reduced from 10 days to three or four.\nModern format.\nToday, the free-admission Hill still provides a festival atmosphere with a fairground in operation on the Friday and Saturday. The walk-in nature of the Hill typically sees Derby attendances exceed 100,000 spectators, making it one of the largest sporting events in the United Kingdom.\nSponsorship.\nIn 2021 and 2022 the race, along with seven other races at the Derby festival, was sponsored by Cazoo. Cazoo declined an option to extend their sponsorship and in April 2023 the bookmaker Betfred agreed a three-year deal to sponsor the Derby and Oaks.\nInvestec was the previous sponsor of the Derby between 2009 and 2020. The race was previously backed by Ever Ready (1984\u201394) and Vodafone (1995\u20132008).\nPopular culture.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Jockey colours header/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWinners.\nWinning distances are shown in lengths or shorter (dh = dead-heat; shd = short-head; hd = head; snk = short-neck; nk = neck).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Legend/styles.css\" /&gt;\u00a0\u00a0 Wartime substitute race at Newmarket\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n49.

He is best known for creating the first gasoline\u2013electric hybrid vehicle (Lohner\u2013Porsche), the Volkswagen Beetle, the Auto Union racing cars, the Mercedes-Benz SS/SSK, and several other important developments and Porsche automobiles.\nAn important contributor to the German war effort during World War II, Porsche was involved in the production of advanced tanks such as the VK 45.01 (P), the Elefant (initially called \"Ferdinand\") self-propelled gun, and the Panzer VIII Maus super-heavy tank, as well as other weapon systems, including the V-1 flying bomb. Porsche was a member of the Nazi Party and an honorary Oberf\u00fchrer of the Allgemeine SS. He was a recipient of the German National Prize for Art and Science, the SS-Ehrenring and the War Merit Cross.\nPorsche was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1996 and was named the Car Engineer of the Century in 1999.\nEarly life.\nFerdinand Porsche was born to Anna Porsche (n\u00e9e Ehrlich) and Anton Porsche, in Maffersdorf (Vratislavice nad Nisou) in northern Bohemia, part of Austria-Hungary at that time, and today part of the Czech Republic. Ferdinand was his parents' third child. His father was a master panel-beater.\nFerdinand showed a great aptitude for technology and was especially intrigued by electricity from a young age. He was already attending classes at the Imperial Polytechnical College in nearby Reichenberg (), some from his home, at night, while still helping his father in his mechanical shop by day. Thanks to a referral, Porsche landed a job with the B\u00e9la Egger &amp; Co. Electrical company in Vienna (later Brown Boveri, now ABB), and moved there in 1893, at age 18. While working in Vienna, he enrolled as a part-time student at what is now the Vienna University of Technology, and went there whenever he could after work. Besides attending classes there, Porsche did not complete any formal engineering education. During his five years with B\u00e9la Egger, he built their first electric wheel-hub motor, the concept for which had been developed by American inventor Wellington Adams, and Porsche also raced it, in 1897.\nAfter the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I, he chose Czechoslovak citizenship. In 1934, either Adolf Hitler or Joseph Goebbels made Porsche a naturalized German citizen.\nEarly career.\nIn 1897 or 1898, Porsche joined the Vienna-based factory Jakob Lohner &amp; Company, which produced coaches for Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria as well as for the monarchs of the UK, Sweden, and Romania. Jakob Lohner had begun construction of automobiles in 1896 under Ludwig Lohner in the trans-Danubian suburb of Floridsdorf. Their first design \u2014 unveiled in Vienna, Austria, on 26 June 1898 \u2014 was the Egger\u2013Lohner vehicle (also referred to as the C.2 Phaeton).\nThe Egger\u2013Lohner was a carriage-like car driven by two electric motors within the front wheel hubs, powered by batteries. This drivetrain construction was easily expanded to four-wheel drive by mounting two more electric motors to the rear wheels, and a four-motor example was ordered by Englishman E. W. Hart in 1900. In December that year, the car was displayed at the Paris World Exhibition under the name Toujours-Contente. Even though this one-off vehicle had been commissioned for racing and record-breaking, its of lead\u2013acid batteries was a severe shortcoming. Though it \"showed wonderful speed when it was allowed to sprint\", the weight of the batteries rendered it slow to climb hills. It also suffered from a limited range due to limited battery life.\nStill employed by Lohner, Porsche introduced the \"Lohner\u2013Porsche Mixte Hybrid\" in 1901: instead of a massive battery-pack, an internal combustion engine built by the German firm Daimler drove a generator which in turn drove the electric wheel hub motors. As a backup, a small battery pack was fitted. This is the first petroleum-electric hybrid vehicle on record. Since sufficiently reliable gears and couplings were not available at the time, he chose to make it a series-hybrid, an arrangement now more common in diesel\u2013electric or turbo-electric railway locomotives than in automobiles.\nThough over 300 Lohner\u2013Porsche chassis were sold up to 1906, most of them were two-wheel drive; either front- or rear-wheel driven trucks, buses, and fire-engines. Some four-wheel-drive buses were produced, but no four-wheel-drive automobiles.\nThe vehicles achieved speeds of up to , broke several Austrian speed records, and also won the Exelberg Rally in 1901, with Porsche himself driving a front-wheel drive hybrid. It was later upgraded with more powerful engines from Daimler and Panhard, which proved to be enough to gain more speed records. In 1905, Porsche was awarded the \"P\u00f6tting prize\" as Austria's most outstanding automotive engineer.\nIn 1902, he was drafted into military service. He served as a chauffeur to Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, whose assassination has been credited with contributing to the start of WWI.\nAustro-Daimler.\nIn 1906, Austro-Daimler recruited Ferdinand Porsche as their chief designer. Porsche's best-known Austro-Daimler car was designed for the Prince Henry Trial in 1910, named after Wilhelm II's younger brother Prince Heinrich of Prussia. Examples of this streamlined, 85 horsepower (63\u00a0kW) car won the first three places, and the car is still better known by the nickname \"Prince Henry\" than by its model name \"Modell 27/80\". He also created a 30 horsepower model called the Maja, named after Mercedes Jellinek's younger sister, Andr\u00e9e Maja (or Maia) Jellinek.\nPorsche had advanced to managing director by 1916 and received an honorary doctorate from the Vienna University of Technology in 1916: the title \"Dr. Ing. h.c.\" is an abbreviation of \"Doktor Ingenieur Honoris Causa\". Porsche successfully continued to construct racing cars, winning 43 out of 53 races with his 1922 design. In 1923, Porsche left Austro-Daimler after differences ensued about the future direction of car development.\nA few months later, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft hired Porsche to serve as Technical Director in Stuttgart, Germany, which was already a major center for the German automotive industry. In 1924, he received another honorary doctorate from the Stuttgart Technical University for his work at Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in Stuttgart and was later given the honorary title of Professor. While at Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft he came up with several very successful race car designs. The series of models equipped with superchargers that culminated in the Mercedes-Benz SSK dominated its class of motor racing in the 1920s.\nIn 1926, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft and Benz &amp; Cie merged into Daimler-Benz, with their joint products beginning to be called Mercedes-Benz. However, Porsche's idea for a small, lightweight Mercedes-Benz car was not popular with Daimler-Benz's board. He left in 1929 for Steyr Automobile, but due to the Great Depression, Porsche ended up being made redundant.\nFounding of Porsche.\nIn April 1931, Porsche returned to Stuttgart and founded his consulting firm \"Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH, Konstruktionen und Beratungen f\u00fcr Motoren und Fahrzeugbau\" (designs and consulting services for motors and vehicles). With financial backing from his son-in-law, the Austrian attorney Anton Pi\u00ebch, and Adolf Rosenberger, Porsche successfully recruited several former co-workers he had befriended at his former places of employment, including Karl Rabe, Erwin Komenda, Franz Xaver Reimspiess, and his son, Ferry Porsche.\nTheir first project was the design of a middle-class car for Wanderer. Other commissioned designs followed. As the business grew, Porsche decided to work on his own design as well, which was a development of the small car concept from his days at Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart. He financed the project with a loan on his life insurance. Later, Z\u00fcndapp decided to help sponsor the project, but lost interest after their success with motorcycles. NSU then took over the sponsorship, but also lost interest due to the high tooling costs.\nWith car commissions scarce due to the depressed economic climate, Porsche founded a subsidiary company, \"Hochleistungs Motor GmbH (High Performance Engines Ltd.),\" to develop a racing car for which he had no customer. Based on Max Wagner's mid-engined layout the \"1923 Benz Tropfenwagen\", or \"Teardrop\" aerodynamic design, the experimental P-Wagen project racing car (P stood for Porsche) was designed according to the regulations of the 750\u00a0kg formula. The main regulation of this formula was that the weight of the car without driver, fuel, oil, water, and tires was not allowed to exceed .\nIn 1932, Auto Union Gmbh was formed, consisting of struggling auto manufacturers Audi, DKW, Horch and Wanderer. The chairman of the Board of Directors, Baron Klaus von Oertzen, wanted a showpiece project, so at fellow director Adolf Rosenberger's insistence, von Oertzen met with Porsche, who had done work for him before.\nAt the 1933 Berlin Motor Show German Chancellor Adolf Hitler announced his intention to motorize the nation, with every German owning either a car or a tractor in the future, and unveiled two new programs: the \"people's car\", and a state-sponsored motor racing programme to develop a \"high speed German automotive industry\"; to facilitate this, Mercedes-Benz were to be given an annual grant of 500,000\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01.\nVolkswagen Beetle and government commission.\nIn June 1934, Porsche received a contract from Hitler to design a people's car (or \"Volkswagen\"), following on from his previous designs such as the 1931 Type 12 car designed for Z\u00fcndapp. The first two prototypes were completed in 1935. These were followed by several further pre-production batches from 1936 to 1939.\nThe car was similar to the contemporary designs of Hans Ledwinka of Tatra, in particular the Tatra V570 and Tatra 97. This resulted in a lawsuit against Porsche claiming infringement of Tatra's patents regarding air-cooling of the rear engine. The suit was interrupted by the German invasion of Czechoslovakia: several years after World War II Volkswagen paid a settlement.\nSince being engaged by the National-Socialist authorities in building the \"Volksauto\", Porsche was praised as the \"Great German Engineer\". Hitler considered Czechs subhuman and Porsche was urged to apply for German citizenship in 1934. A few days later, he indeed filed a declaration giving up the Czechoslovak citizenship at a Czechoslovak consulate in Stuttgart. In 1937, he joined the Nazi Party (becoming member no. 5,643,287) as well as the SS. By 1938, he was using the SS as security personnel and drivers at his factory, and later set up a special unit called \"SS Sturmwerk Volkswagen\". In 1942, he reached the rank of \"SS-Oberf\u00fchrer\", and during the war, he was further decorated with the SS-Ehrenring and awarded the War Merit Cross. As the war progressed, his proposed solutions to new developments became more complex, and he gained a reputation in certain circles as a \"mad scientist,\" especially with Albert Speer (mainly due to his newfound affinity for \"pointy\" designs).\nA new city, \"Stadt des KdF-Wagens\" was founded near Fallersleben for the Volkswagen factory, but wartime production concentrated almost exclusively on the military K\u00fcbelwagen and Schwimmwagen variants. Mass production of the car, which later became known as the Beetle, began after the end of the war. The city is named Wolfsburg today and is still the headquarters of the Volkswagen Group.\nAuto Union racing car.\nGerman racing driver Hans Stuck had met Hitler before he became Chancellor, and not being able to gain a seat at Mercedes, accepted the invitation of Rosenberger to join him, von Oertzen, and Porsche in approaching the Chancellor. In a meeting in the Reich Chancellery, Hitler agreed with Porsche that for the glory of Germany, it would be better for two companies to take part in the racing car project, resulting in Hitler agreeing to split the money between Mercedes and Auto Union with 250,000\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01 to each company. This highly annoyed Mercedes, who had already developed their Mercedes-Benz W25, and resulted in a heated exchange both on and off the racing track between the two companies for the period until World War II.\nHaving obtained state funds, Auto Union bought \"Hochleistungs Motor GmbH\" and hence the P-Wagen Project for 75,000\u00a0\u211b\ufe01\u2133\ufe01, relocating the company to Chemnitz. As Porsche became more involved with the construction of the Wolfsburg factory, he handed over his racing projects to his son, Ferry. The dominance of the \"Silver Arrows\" of both brands was only stopped by the outbreak of World War II in 1939.\nMilitary vehicles.\nAdolf Hitler had discussed the possibility of military application of the Volkswagen with Porsche as early as April 1934. A Porsche brochure in 1934 said a \"car must be suitable not only for personal use, but also for transport and particular military purposes.\" It was not until January 1938 that high-ranking \"Heereswaffenamt\" officials formally approached him about designing an inexpensive, lightweight military transport vehicle that could operate reliably both on- and off-road, in even the most extreme conditions.\nFull-scale production of the Type 82 K\u00fcbelwagen started in February 1940, as soon as the VW factories had become operational. When Volkswagen production ceased by the end of the war, 50,435 \"K\u00fcbelwagen\" vehicles were produced, and the vehicle proved surprisingly capable, adaptable, and durable. The K\u00fcbelwagen became a ubiquitous military implement and had a similar impact on the German army as did the jeep for the Americans.\nThe Volkswagen Schwimmwagen used the engine and mechanicals of the VW Type 86 four-wheel drive prototype of the K\u00fcbelwagen. Schwimmwagens were produced by the Volkswagen factory at Fallersleben (Stadt des KdF-Wagens) and Porsche's facilities in Stuttgart. 15,584 Type 166 Schwimmwagen were produced from 1941 through 1944, which makes it the most-produced amphibious car in history.\nBy the end of World War II, Volkswagen had built a total of 66,285 vehicles, of which 630 were for civilian use, which the Nazi elite appropriated. None of the 336,000 German citizens who completed their full down payment received a car. Their combined savings of over 380 million Reichsmark went to the war effort. In 1961, some deposit holders received a partial credit towards purchasing a new Volkswagen.\nShortly after the beginning of the war on 1 September 1939, Ferdinand Porsche was appointed chairman of the , an advisory group of engineers and industrialists created by Adolf Hitler. He was removed in 1943 after his tank designs were widely considered a failure.\nPorsche produced a heavy tank prototype, VK 30.01 (P), which evolved into the VK 45.01 (P), also known as \"Tiger (P)\". Due to the complex nature of the drive system, a competing design from Henschel was chosen for production instead. Ninety chassis that had already been built were converted into self-propelled anti-tank guns; these were put into service in 1943 as the \"Panzerj\u00e4ger Tiger\" (P) and known by the nickname \"Ferdinand\".\nThe Ferdinand was driven by a hybrid electric powertrain and was armed with a long-barreled development of the 88mm anti-aircraft gun. The most common reason for losses was that the vehicle became stuck or broke down, and so the crews often had to destroy their own vehicles to avoid allowing them to be captured. It had a kill ratio of nearly 10:1, but as with most German wartime vehicles, the lack of supplies made maintenance a serious problem, reducing the effectiveness of the vehicles and forcing crews to destroy many otherwise operational vehicles.\nPorsche also designed the Panzer VIII Maus. The development of the Maus originates from a contract given to Porsche for the design of a 100-ton tank in March 1942. Porsche's design, known as the \"VK 100.01\" /\u00a0\"Porsche Type 205\", was shown to Adolf Hitler in June 1942, who subsequently approved it. Only two prototypes were produced. As of 2025, it is the heaviest fully enclosed armored fighting vehicle ever built.\nIn November 1941, Hitler demanded that Porsche design an artillery tractor suitable for conditions on the Eastern Front. Leaning on his prior experience with the Austro-Daimler M17, Porsche submitted the Type 175. Final development and production on what became \u0160koda RSO took place at the \u0160koda automobile plant in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav, in what was then the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The RSO went through its first trials in 1942. Due to its poor performance, it never reached the Eastern Front. Instead, it was deployed in France, in the Netherlands, and in the Battle of the Bulge. Only 206 vehicles were built.\nIn late 1944, Porsche was contracted to develop a new turbojet engine for the V1 flying bomb. Although he worked on this project until the final days of the war and blueprints for the Porsche 109-005 turbojet engine were ready to be submitted, it never saw the light of day.\nAfter the war.\nIn November 1945, Porsche was asked to continue the design of the Volkswagen in France and to move the factory equipment there as part of war reparations. Whilst in France, Porsche was also asked to consult on the design/manufacture of the upcoming Renault 4CV, which led to a serious conflict with the recently appointed head of Renault, the former resistance hero, Pierre Lefaucheux. Differences within the French government and objections from the French automotive industry put a halt to the Volkswagen project before it had even begun. On 15 December 1945, French authorities arrested Porsche, Anton Pi\u00ebch, and Ferry Porsche as war criminals. While Ferry was freed after six months, Ferdinand and Anton were imprisoned first in Baden-Baden and then in Paris and Dijon.\nWhile his father was in captivity, Ferry worked diligently to keep the company in business, developing a division for the repair of automobiles, water pumps, and winches. A contract with Piero Dusio was completed for a Grand Prix motor racing car, the \"Type 360 Cisitalia\". The innovative 4WD design never raced.\nThe legal basis of Pi\u00ebch and Porsche's imprisonment was principally Ferdinand Porsche's contribution to his country's war effort and personal friendship with Hitler. In the Porsche family's own account, the affair was a thinly veiled attempt at extorting money and forcing them to collaborate with Renault; at the same time, the family was deceptive about the use of forced labor and the size of their wartime operation. It was later shown that approximately 300 forced laborers were employed, including Poles and Russians. During the war, it was common practice for German factories of this size (about 1,000 workers) to use what was essentially slave labor, often with Slavic prisoners of war, who were frequently worked to death. The post-war French government required a payment of one million francs, variously described as ransom or bail, for the release of Pi\u00ebch and Porsche. Initially unable to obtain this amount of money, the family eventually raised it through their contract with Cisitalia. During a trial, witnesses were brought forward to testify that no French prisoners had been imported to work at the plant.\nIn addition to its work with Cisitalia, the company also started on a new design, the Porsche 356, the first car to carry the Porsche brand name. The company had relocated from Stuttgart to Gm\u00fcnd in Carinthia to avoid Allied bombing. The company started manufacturing the Porsche 356 in an old saw mill in Gm\u00fcnd. The Gm\u00fcnd factory made only 49 cars, entirely by hand.\nReturn to Stuttgart.\nThe Porsche family returned to Stuttgart in 1949, not knowing how to restart their business. While the banks would not give them credit, as the company's plant was still under American embargo and could not serve as collateral, they did still possess considerable resources. So Ferry Porsche took one of the limited series 356 models from Gm\u00fcnd and visited Volkswagen dealers to raise some orders. He asked the dealers to pay for the ordered cars in advance.\nThe series production version made in Stuttgart had a steel body, welded to the central-tube platform chassis, instead of the aluminium body used in the initial limited Gm\u00fcnd-made series. When Ferry Porsche resurrected the company, he counted on series production figures of about 1,500. More than 78,000 Porsche 356s were manufactured in the following 17 years.\nPorsche was later contracted by Volkswagen for additional consulting work and received a royalty on every Volkswagen Beetle manufactured. This provided Porsche with a comfortable income as more than 20 million Type I were built.\nIn November 1950, Porsche visited the Wolfsburg Volkswagen factory for the first time since the end of World War II. Porsche spent his visit chatting with Volkswagen president Heinrich Nordhoff about the future of VW Beetles, which were already being produced in large numbers.\nA few weeks later, Porsche suffered a stroke. He did not fully recover and died on 30 January 1951.\nIn 1996, Porsche was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame and in 1999 posthumously won the award of Car Engineer of the Century.\nViews on labour.\nPorsche visited Henry Ford's operation in Detroit many times, where he learned the importance of productivity. There, he learned to monitor work. He was also surprised at how the workers and the managers treated each other as equals; even he, as a visiting dignitary, had to carry his own tray in the cafeteria and eat with the workers.\nThe need to increase productivity became a primary interest of Porsche's. Conventional methods for increasing productivity included longer working hours, a faster work rate, and new labor-saving techniques. Initially, the Volkswagen project was envisioned as a collaboration among existing German auto manufacturers; however, they withdrew from the project, necessitating a fresh approach with a new, comprehensive workforce. The Volkswagen plant was completed in 1938 after workers from Italy were brought in. Volkswagen, under Ferdinand Porsche, used and profited from forced labour. That included a large number of Soviets. By early 1945, German nationals comprised only 10% of Volkswagen's workforce.\nControversy in Porsche's birthplace.\nFollowing protests and criminal complaints from a local World War II survivors group that Maffersdorf in the Sudetenland, known today as Vratislavice nad Nisou, was promoting Nazism by displaying signs commemorating its native son, the local authorities removed the signs in 2013. They also changed the composition of a local museum display so that it not only commemorates Porsche's automotive achievements, but also mentions his Nazi party and SS membership, and shows the importance of his work for the Nazi cause.\nThe local Porsche car owner association criticized the move as misguided and intended to tarnish the good name of Porsche. Porsche AG subsequently removed the show cars it had previously provided to the museum. The museum is part of \u0160koda, which, like Porsche AG, is a part of the Volkswagen Group. The Porsche-Pi\u00ebch family, through the holding company Porsche SE, is a major shareholder and controls the majority of the Volkswagen Group's voting rights. The Porsche family representatives didn't respond to a request for comment about the controversy.\nAdolf Rosenberger Controversy.\nIn June 2019, a documentary about Adolf Rosenberger, the Jewish co-founder of Porsche, aired on German TV. Despite Rosenberger's contributions to the German automotive industry and German auto racing, when Hitler ascended to power, Rosenberger was arrested for \"Rassenschande\" (racial crimes) and imprisoned at the Kislau concentration camp near Karlsruhe. , who succeeded Rosenberger at Porsche, intervened with the Gestapo and affected his release after three months of imprisonment. \nRosenberger had to leave Germany, and his ownership stake was subject to \"Aryanization\", a Nazi policy that was part of the broader persecution of Jews. That allowed Ferdinand Porsche and Anton Pi\u00ebch to acquire Rosenberger's stake in the company at nominal value, well below its worth. Although Porsche and Pi\u00ebch settled with Rosenberger after the war, his founding role was never fully recognized. Rosenberger's 10% stake in Porsche would have made him a billionaire.\nStreet Naming Controversy.\nIn December 2022, the city council of Linz, a city in Austria, formally renamed \"Porscheweg\" (\"Porsche Road\") due to Porsche's central role in the Nazi war economy. Porsche AG told the Kurier newspaper that it did not support the renaming.\nLegacy.\nFerdinand Porsche's legacy is lasting and complex. The work of his indisputable engineering genius and the results of his resilience and acumen are still felt today. Volkswagen Group, which his heirs control, is the second-largest car manufacturer in the world. He also supported and greatly benefited from one of history's most monstrous regimes.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is a set of UNIX commands that allow multiple users to develop and maintain program code or documents. With RCS, users can make their own revisions of a document, commit changes, and merge them. RCS was originally developed for programs but is also useful for text documents or configuration files that are frequently revised.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nRCS was first released in 1982\nby Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University. It was an alternative tool to the then-popular Source Code Control System (SCCS) which was nearly the first version control software tool (developed in 1972 by early Unix developers). RCS is currently maintained by the GNU Project.\nAn innovation in RCS is the adoption of \"reverse deltas\". Instead of storing every revision in a file like SCCS does with interleaved deltas, RCS stores a set of edit instructions to go back to an earlier version of the file. Tichy claims that it is faster for most cases because the recent revisions are used more often.\nLegal and licensing.\nInitially (through version 3, which was distributed in 4.3BSD), its license prohibited redistribution without written permission from Walter Tichy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Copyright (C) 1982 by Walter F. Tichy [...] All rights reserved. No part of this software may be sold or distributed in any form or by any means without the prior written permission of the author.\nA READ_ME file accompanied some versions of RCS which further restricted distribution, e.g., in 4.3BSD-Reno.\nCa. 1989, the RCS license was altered to something similar to the contemporary BSD licenses, as seen by comments in the source code.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Redistribution and use in source and binary forms are permitted provided that the above copyright notice and this paragraph are duplicated in all such forms and that any documentation, advertising materials, and other materials related to such distribution and use acknowledge that the software was developed by Walter Tichy.\nRCS 4.3, released 26 July 1990, was distributed \"under license by the Free Software Foundation\", under the terms of the GPL.\nOpenBSD provides a different implementation called \"OpenRCS\", which is BSD-licensed.\nBehavior.\nMode of operation.\nRCS works well with standalone files and supports multi-file projects but, by modern standards, that support is limited: RCS can assemble the versions of multiple files into a single release (via \"symbolic names\") but it lacks support for atomic commit across those files. Although it provides branching, the version syntax is cumbersome. Instead of using branches, many teams just use the built-in locking mechanism and work on a single \"head\" branch.\nUsage.\nRCS revolves around the usage of \"revision groups\" or sets of files that have been checked-in via the codice_1 (checkout) and codice_2 (check-in) commands. By default, a checked-in file is removed and replaced with a \",v\" file (so foo.rb when checked in becomes foo.rb,v) which can then be checked out by anyone with access to the revision group. RCS files (again, files with the extension \",v\") reflect the main file with additional metadata on its first lines. Once checked in, RCS stores revisions in a tree structure that can be followed so that a user can revert a file to a previous form if necessary.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Some chemical compounds made from petroleum are also obtained from other fossil fuels, such as coal or natural gas, or renewable sources such as maize, palm fruit or sugar cane.\nThe two most common petrochemical classes are olefins (including ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (including benzene, toluene and xylene isomers).\nOil refineries produce olefins and aromatics by fluid catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions. Chemical plants produce olefins by steam cracking of natural gas liquids like ethane and propane. Aromatics are produced by catalytic reforming of naphtha. Olefins and aromatics are the building-blocks for a wide range of materials such as solvents, detergents, and adhesives. Olefins are the basis for polymers and oligomers used in plastics, resins, fibers, elastomers, lubricants, and gels.\nGlobal ethylene production was 190 million tonnes and propylene was 120 million tonnes in 2019. Aromatics production is approximately 70 million tonnes. The largest petrochemical industries are located in the United States and Western Europe; however, major growth in new production capacity is in the Middle East and Asia. There is substantial inter-regional petrochemical trade.\nPrimary petrochemicals are divided into three groups depending on their chemical structure:\nIn 2007, the amounts of ethylene and propylene produced in steam crackers were about 115 Mt (megatonnes) and 70 Mt, respectively. The output ethylene capacity of large steam crackers ranged up to as much as 1.0 \u2013 1.5 Mt per year.\nThe adjacent diagram schematically depicts the major hydrocarbon sources and processes used in producing petrochemicals.\nLike commodity chemicals, petrochemicals are made on a very large scale. Petrochemical manufacturing units differ from commodity chemical plants in that they often produce a number of related products. Compare this with specialty chemical and fine chemical manufacture where products are made in discrete batch processes.\nPetrochemicals are predominantly made in a few manufacturing locations around the world, for example in Jubail and Yanbu Industrial Cities in Saudi Arabia, Texas and Louisiana in the US, in Teesside in the Northeast of England in the United Kingdom, in Tarragona in Catalonia, in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, in Antwerp in Belgium, in Jamnagar, Dahej in Gujarat, India and in Singapore. Not all of the petrochemical or commodity chemical materials produced by the chemical industry are made in one single location but groups of related materials are often made in adjacent manufacturing plants to induce industrial symbiosis as well as material and utility efficiency and other economies of scale. This is known in chemical engineering terminology as integrated manufacturing. Specialty and fine chemical companies are sometimes found in similar manufacturing locations as petrochemicals but, in most cases, they do not need the same level of large-scale infrastructure (e.g., pipelines, storage, ports, and power, etc.) and therefore can be found in multi-sector business parks.\nThe large-scale petrochemical manufacturing locations have clusters of manufacturing units that share utilities and large-scale infrastructures such as power stations, storage tanks, port facilities, road and rail terminals. In the United Kingdom, for example, there are four main locations for such manufacturing: near the River Mersey in North West England, on the Humber on the East coast of Yorkshire, in Grangemouth near the Firth of Forth in Scotland, and in Teesside as part of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). To demonstrate the clustering and integration, some 50% of the United Kingdom's petrochemical and commodity chemicals are produced by the NEPIC industry cluster companies in Teesside.\nHistory.\nIn 1835, Henri Victor Regnault, a French chemist left vinyl chloride in the sun and found white solid at the bottom of the flask which was polyvinyl chloride. In 1839, Eduard Simon discovered polystyrene by accident by distilling storax. In 1856, William Henry Perkin discovered the first synthetic dye, Mauveine. In 1888, Friedrich Reinitzer, an Austrian plant scientist observed cholesteryl benzoate had two different melting points. In 1909, Leo Hendrik Baekeland invented bakelite made from phenol and formaldehyde. In 1920, Union Carbide built in West Virginia first petrochemical plant in the world. In 1928, synthetic fuels were invented using Fischer-Tropsch process. In 1929, Walter Bock invented synthetic rubber Buna-S which is made up of styrene and butadiene and used to make car tires. In 1933, Otto R\u00f6hm polymerized the first acrylic glass methyl methacrylate. In 1935, Michael Perrin invented polyethylene. In 1937, Wallace Hume Carothers invented nylon. In 1938, Otto Bayer invented polyurethane. In 1941, Roy Plunkett invented Teflon. In 1946, he invented Polyester. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are made from ethylene and paraxylene. In 1949, Fritz Stastny turned polystyrene into foam. After World War II, polypropylene was discovered in the early 1950s. In 1965, Stephanie Kwolek invented Kevlar.\nOlefins.\nThe following is a partial list of major commercial petrochemicals and their derivatives:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Tree list/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67733", "revid": "18481282", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67733", "title": "Chestnut", "text": "Genus of plants\nChestnuts are the deciduous trees and shrubs in the genus Castanea, in the beech family Fagaceae. The name also refers to the edible nuts they produce. They are native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere.\nDescription.\nChestnut trees are of moderate growth rate (for the Chinese chestnut tree) to fast growth rate (for American and European species). Their mature heights vary from the smallest species of chinkapins, often shrubby, to the giant of past American forests, \"C. dentata\" that could reach . Between these extremes are found the Japanese chestnut tree (\"C. crenata\") at 10 m average; followed by the Chinese chestnut tree (\"C. mollissima\") at about 15 m, then the European chestnut tree (\"C.\u00a0sativa\") around 30 m.\nThe Chinese and more so the Japanese chestnut trees are both often multileadered and wide-spreading, whereas European and especially American species tend to grow very erect when planted among others, with little tapering of their columnar trunks, which are firmly set and massive. When standing on their own, they spread on the sides and develop broad, rounded, dense crowns at maturity. The foliage of the European and American species has striking yellow autumn coloring.\nIts bark is smooth when young, of a vinous maroon or red-brown color for the American chestnut, grey for the European chestnut. With age, American species' bark becomes grey and darker, thick, and deeply furrowed; the furrows run longitudinally, and tend to twist around the trunk as the tree ages, sometimes reminiscent of a large cable with twisted strands.\nThe leaves are simple, ovate or lanceolate, 10\u201330 cm long, and 4\u201310 cm wide, with sharply pointed, widely spaced teeth, with shallow rounded sinuates between.\nThe flowers follow the leaves, appearing in late spring or early summer or into July. They are arranged in long catkins of two kinds, with both kinds being borne on every tree. Some catkins are made of only male flowers, which mature first. Each flower has eight stamens, or 10 to 12 for \"C. mollissima\". The ripe pollen carries a heavy, sweet odor that some people find too sweet or unpleasant. Other catkins have these pollen-bearing flowers, but also carry near the twig from which these spring, small clusters of female or fruit-producing flowers. Two or three flowers together form a four-lobed prickly calybium, which ultimately grows completely together to make the brown hull, or husk, covering the fruits.\nChestnut flowers are not self-compatible, so two trees are required for pollination. All \"Castanea\" species readily hybridize with each other.\nFruit.\nThe fruit is contained in a spiny (very sharp) cupule 5\u201311 cm in diameter, also called \"bur\" or \"burr\". The burrs are often paired or clustered on the branch and contain one to seven nuts according to the different species, varieties, and cultivars. Around the time the fruits reach maturity, the burrs turn yellow-brown and split open in two or four sections. They can remain on the tree longer than they hold the fruit, but more often achieve complete opening and release the fruits only after having fallen on the ground; opening is partly due to soil humidity.\nThe chestnut fruit has a pointed end with a small tuft at its tip (called \"flame\" in Italian), and at the other end, a hilum \u2013 a pale brown attachment scar. In many varieties, the fruit is flattened on one or two sides. It has two skins. The first one is a hard, shiny, brown outer hull or husk, called the pericarpus; the industry calls this the \"peel\". Underneath the pericarpus is another, thinner skin, called the pellicle or episperm. The pellicle closely adheres to the seed itself, following the grooves usually present at the surface of the fruit. These grooves are of variable sizes and depths according to the species and variety.\nThe fruit inside these shows a germ with two cotyledons connected to creamy-white flesh throughout. Some varieties have consistently only one embryo per fruit (nut) or have only one large fruit per burr, well rounded (no flat face). The name of varieties with these characteristics may start with \"marron\" for example \"marron de Lyon\" in France, or \"Marrone di Mugello\" in Italy.\nChestnut fruit may not exhibit epigeal dormancy. It may germinate right upon falling to the ground in the autumn, with the roots emerging from the seed right away and the leaves and stem the following spring. The germ can lose viability soon after ripening and under drying conditions.\nThe superior fruiting varieties among European chestnuts have good size, sweet taste, and easy-to-remove inner skins. American chestnuts are usually very small (around 5 g), but sweet-tasting with easy-to-remove pellicles. Some Japanese varieties have very large nuts (around 40 g), with typically difficult-to-remove pellicles. Chinese chestnut pellicles are usually easy to remove, and their sizes vary greatly according to the varieties, although usually smaller than the Japanese chestnut.\nSimilar species.\nThe unrelated horse chestnuts (genus \"Aesculus\") are not true chestnuts, but are named for producing nuts of similar appearance that are mildly poisonous to humans. True chestnuts should also not be confused with water chestnuts, which are tubers of an aquatic herbaceous plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Other species commonly mistaken for chestnut trees are the chestnut oak (\"Quercus prinus\") and the American beech (\"Fagus grandifolia\"), both of which are also in the Fagaceae family. Brazil nuts, called \"Brasil chestnuts\" (\"casta\u00f1as de Brasil\" in Spanish) or \"chestnuts from Par\u00e1\" (\"castanha-do-Par\u00e1\" in Portuguese) are also unrelated.\nTaxonomy.\nSpecies.\nChestnuts belong to the family Fagaceae, which also includes oaks and beeches. The four main species groups are commonly known as American, European, Chinese, and Japanese chestnuts.\nThe taxonomy of the American chestnuts is not completely resolved, particularly between the chinkapins (\"Castanea ozarkensis\" and \"Castanea pumila\"), which are sometimes considered to be the same species. Genetics have indicated the California native \"golden chinkapin\" (Chrysolepis chrysophylla) is worthy of inclusion in a different genus along with a species from Coastal China. There is also another chestnut, \"Castanea alabamensis\", which may be its own species.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"chestnut\" is derived from an earlier English term \"chesten nut\", which descends from the Old French word \"chastain\" (Modern French, \"ch\u00e2taigne\"). The French word in turn derives from Latin \"Castanea\" (also the scientific name of the tree), which traces to the Ancient Greek word \u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd (sweet chestnut). A possible source of the Greek word is the ancient town of Casthanaea in Magnesia. Its location is at the modern village of Keramidi. The town probably took its name, though, from the trees growing around it. In the Mediterranean climate zone, chestnut trees are rarer in Greece because the chalky soil is not conducive to the tree's growth. Kastania is located on one of the relatively few sedimentary or siliceous outcrops. They grow so abundantly there that their presence would have determined the place's name. Still others take the name as coming from the Greek name of \"Sardis glans\" (Sardis acorn) \u2013 Sardis being the capital of Lydia, Asia Minor, from where the fruit had spread.\nThe name is cited twice in the King James Version of the Bible. In one instance, Jacob puts peeled twigs in the water troughs to promote healthy offspring of his livestock. Although it may indicate another tree, it indicates the fruit was a local staple food in the early 17th century.\nThese synonyms are or have been in use: \"Fagus Castanea\" (used by Linnaeus in first edition of \"Species Plantarum\", 1753), Sardian nut, Jupiter's nut, husked nut, and Spanish chestnut (U.S.).\nEcology.\nThe tree is noted for attracting wildlife. The nuts are an important food for jays, pigeons, wild boar, deer, and squirrels. \nAmerican and Chinese chinquapins (\"C. pumila\" and \"C. henryi\") have very small nuts that are an important source of food for wildlife.\nCultivation.\nHistory.\nEurope and the Near East.\nIt has been a staple food in southern Europe, Turkey, and southwestern and eastern Asia for millennia, largely replacing cereals where these would not grow well, if at all, in mountainous Mediterranean areas. Evidence of its cultivation by humans is found since around 2000 BC. Alexander the Great and the Romans planted chestnut trees across Europe while on their various campaigns. A Greek army is said to have survived their retreat from Asia Minor in 401\u2013399 BC thanks to their stores of chestnuts. Ancient Greeks, such as Dioscorides and Galen, wrote of chestnuts to comment on their medicinal properties\u2014and of the flatulence induced by eating too much of it. To the early Christians, chestnuts symbolized chastity. Until the introduction of the potato, whole forest-dwelling communities which had scarce access to wheat flour relied on chestnuts as their main source of carbohydrates. In some parts of Italy, a cake made of chestnuts is used as a substitute for potatoes. In 1583, Charles Estienne and Jean Li\u00e9bault wrote, \"an infinity of people live on nothing else but (the chestnut)\". In 1802, an Italian agronomist said of Tuscany that \"the fruit of the chestnut tree is practically the sole subsistence of our highlanders\", while in 1879 it was said that it almost exclusively fed whole populations for half the year, as \"a temporary but complete substitution for cereals\".\nThe Hundred Horse Chestnut in the chestnut forests on Mount Etna is the oldest living chestnut tree and is said to be even larger. Chestnut trees particularly flourish in the Mediterranean basin. In 1584, the governor of Genoa, which dominated Corsica, ordered all the farmers and landowners to plant four trees yearly, among which was a chestnut tree \u2013 plus olive, fig and mulberry trees. Many communities owe their origin and former richness to the ensuing chestnut woods. In France, the \"marron glac\u00e9\", a candied chestnut involving 16 different processes in a typically French cooking style, is always served at Christmas and New Year's time. In Modena, Italy, they are soaked in wine before roasting and serving, and are also traditionally eaten on Saint Simon's Day in Tuscany. In the Romagna region, roasted chestnuts are often served with a traditional wine, the Cagnina di Romagna. It is traditional to eat roasted chestnuts in Portugal on St. Martin's Day.\nTheir popularity declined during the last few centuries, partly due to their reputation of \"food for poor people\". Many people did not want to take chestnut bread as \"bread\" because chestnut flour does not rise. Some slandered chestnut products in such words as the bread which \"gives a sallow complexion\" written in 1770, or in 1841 \"this kind of mortar which is called a soup\". The last decades' worldwide renewal may have profited from the huge reforestation efforts started in the 1930s in the United States to establish varieties of \"C. sativa\" which may be resistant to chestnut blight, as well as to relieve the strain on cereal supplies.\nThe main region in Italy for chestnut production is the Mugello region; in 1996, the European Community granted the fruit Protected Geographic Indication (equivalent to the French \"Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\") status to the https://. It is markedly sweet, peels easily, is not excessively floury or astringent, and has notes of vanilla, hazelnut, and, more subtly, fresh bread. It has no unpleasant aroma, such as yeast, fungus, mold, or paper, which sometimes occur with other chestnuts. The main regions in France for chestnut production are the d\u00e9partements of Ard\u00e8che, Var (Eastern Provence), C\u00e9vennes (Gard and Loz\u00e8re d\u00e9partements) and the Lyon region. France annually produces over 1,000 metric tons, but still imports about 8,000 metric tons, mainly from Italy.\nIn Portugal's archipelago of Madeira, chestnut liquor is a traditional beverage, and it is gaining popularity with the tourists and in continental Portugal.\nIn Britain, pre-historic pollen records show that the species is an introduced, and not a native, tree. It is associated with sites of Roman-era occupation, but it was already established by that time. Boundary records compiled in the reign of King John showed the famous Tortworth Chestnut in South Gloucestershire was already a landmark; it was known by the name of \"Great Chestnut of Tortworth\" in the days of Stephen. This tree measured over in circumference at from the ground in 1720.\nAsia.\nAlways served as part of the New Year's menu in Japan, chestnuts represent both success and hard times\u2014mastery and strength. The Japanese chestnut (\"kuri\") was in cultivation before rice and the Chinese chestnut (\"C. mollissima\") possibly for 2,000 to 6,000 years.\nDuring British colonial rule in the mid-1700s to 1947, the sweet chestnut, \"C. sativa\", was widely introduced in the temperate parts of the Indian subcontinent, mainly in the lower to middle Himalayas. They are widely found in British-founded hill stations in northern India, and to a lesser extent in Bhutan and Nepal. They are mainly used as an ornamental tree and are found in almost all British-founded botanical gardens and official governmental compounds (such as larger official residences) in temperate parts of the Indian subcontinent.\nChina has about 300 chestnut cultivars. Moreover, the 'Dandong' chestnut (belonging to the Japanese chestnut \"C. crenata\") is a major cultivar in Liaoning Province.\nIn South Korea, roasted chestnuts (\"gunbam\") are a popular winter snack, and serve as a symbol of abundance in ancestral rituals. Roasted chestnuts are also included in folk songs of Korea, which include , a song that celebrates chestnuts, as well as \"Jeongseokga\", a song from the Goryeo period. Gongju, one of Baekje's former capitals, is renowned for its chestnuts, with an annual chestnut festival that takes place in the winter. In the \"Samgukji (Records Of The Three Kingdoms)\", a book that was compiled during the Jin dynasty about the Three Kingdoms, chestnuts are used in the description of Mahan, the former land of Baekje.\nIn the Philippines, the endemic \"talakatak\" or Philippine chestnut (\"Castanopsis philippinensis\") is not cultivated commercially, though its nuts are harvested from the wild and consumed locally. Imported chestnuts (known as \"kastanyas\" in Tagalog, from Spanish \"casta\u00f1as\") are traditionally sold as street food in the Philippines during the Christmas season.\nNorth America.\nNative Americans were eating the American chestnut species, mainly \"C. dentata\" and some others, long before European immigrants introduced their stock to America, and before the arrival of chestnut blight. In some places, such as the Appalachian Mountains, one-quarter of hardwoods were chestnuts. Mature trees often grew straight and branch-free for , up to 100 ft, averaging up to 5 ft in diameter. For three centuries, most barns and homes east of the Mississippi River were made from it. In 1911, the food book \"The Grocer's Encyclopedia\" noted that a cannery in Holland included in its \"vegetables-and-meat\" ready-cooked combinations, a \"chestnuts and sausages\" casserole beside the more classic \"beef and onions\" and \"green peas and veal\". This celebrated the chestnut culture that would bring whole villages out in the woods for three weeks each autumn (and keep them busy all winter), and deplored the lack of food diversity in the United States's shop shelves.\nSoon after that, however, the American chestnuts were nearly wiped out by chestnut blight. The discovery of the blight fungus on some Asian chestnut trees planted on Long Island, New York, was made public in 1904. Within 40 years, the nearly four billion-strong American chestnut population in North America was devastated; only a few clumps of trees remained in Michigan, Wisconsin, California, and the Pacific Northwest. Due to disease, American chestnut wood almost disappeared from the market for decades, although quantities can still be obtained as reclaimed lumber. Today, they only survive as single trees separated from any others (very rare), and as living stumps, or \"stools\", with only a few growing enough shoots to produce seeds shortly before dying. This is just enough to preserve the genetic material used to engineer an American chestnut tree with the minimal necessary genetic input from any of the disease-immune Asiatic species. Efforts started in the 1930s are still ongoing to repopulate the country with these trees, in Massachusetts and many places elsewhere in the United States. In the 1970s, geneticist Charles Burnham began back-breeding Asian chestnut into American chestnut populations to confer blight resistance with the minimum difference in genes. In the 1950s, the Dunstan chestnut was developed in Greensboro, N.C., and constitutes the majority of blight-free chestnuts produced in the United States annually.\nToday, the demand for the nut outstrips supply. The United States imported 4,056 metric tons of European in-shell chestnuts worth $10 million in 2007. The U.S. chestnut industry is in its infancy, producing less than 1% of total world production. Since the mid-20th century, most of the US imports are from Southern Italy, with the large, meaty, and richly flavored Sicilian chestnuts being considered among the best quality for bulk sale and supermarket retail. Some imports come from Portugal and France. The next two largest sources of imports are China and South Korea. The French varieties of \"marrons\" are highly favored and sold at high prices in gourmet shops. As of 2024, the United States imports 7.5 million pounds of non-organic chestnuts per year.\nA study of the sector in 2005 found that U.S. producers are mainly part-timers diversifying an existing agricultural business, or hobbyists. Another recent study indicates that investment in a new plantation takes 13 years to break even, at least within the current Australian market. Starting a small-scale operation requires a relatively low initial investment; this is a factor in the small size of the present production operations, with half of them being between . Another determining factor in the small productivity of the sector is that most orchards have been created less than 10 years ago, so have young trees which are as now barely entering commercial production. Assuming a yield for a 10-year-old tree is a reliable conservative estimate, though some exceptional specimens of that age have yielded . So, most producers earn less than $5,000 per year, with a third of them not having sold anything so far.\nMoreover, the plantings have so far been mostly of Chinese species, but the products are not readily available. The American Chestnut Foundation in collaboration with many partners (SUNY ESF, the American Chestnut Cooperators' Foundation and many others from education, research, and industry sectors contributing to the program) are in the last stages of developing a variety that is as close as possible to the American chestnut, while having incorporated the blight-resistant gene of the Asiatic species. Considering the additional advantage that chestnut trees can be easily grown organically, and assuming the development of brands in the market and everything else being equal, home-grown products would reach higher prices than imports, the high volume of which indicates a market with expanding prospects. As of 2008, the price for chestnuts sold fresh in the shell ranges from $1.50/lb ($3.30/kg) wholesale to about $5/lb ($11/kg) retail, depending mainly on the size.\nAustralia and New Zealand.\nThe Australian gold rush of the 1850s and 1860s led to the first recorded plantings of European chestnut trees, brought from Europe by settlers. Along the years, most chestnut tree plantations were \"C. sativa\" stock, which is still the dominant species. Some of these remain today. Some trees in northern Victoria are around 120 years old and up to 60 m tall. Chestnuts grow well in southwest Western Australia, which has cold winters and warm to hot summers. As of 2008, the country has nearly 350 growers, annually producing around 1,200 metric tons of chestnuts, of which 80% come from northeast Victoria. The produce is mostly sold to the domestic fresh fruit market. Chestnuts are slowly gaining popularity in Australia. A considerable increase in production is expected in the next 10 years, due to the increase in commercial plantings during the last 15 to 25 years. By far, the most common species in Australia is the European chestnut, but small numbers of the other species, as well as some hybrids, have been planted. The Japanese chestnut (\"C. crenata\") does well in wet and humid weather and in hot summers (about 30\u00a0\u00b0C); and was introduced to New Zealand in the early 1900s, more so in the upper North Island region.\nCultivation ecology.\nClimate and seasonal germination cycle.\nChestnuts produce a better crop when subjected to chill temperatures during the dormant period. Frosts and snowfalls are beneficial rather than harmful to the trees. The dormant plant is very cold-hardy in Britain, to the Royal Horticultural Society's H6 hardiness rating, to -20\u00a0\u00b0C. Chestnut is hardy to USDA zone 5, which is lower in average minimal temperature than London in zone 9. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, however, is frost-tender; bud-burst is later than most other fruit trees, so late frosts can be damaging to young buds.\nTrees can be found at altitudes between 200 and 1000 m above sea level; some mention between 300 and 759 m altitude, while the famous Hundred Horse Chestnut on Mount Etna stands at 1200 metres. They can tolerate maritime exposure, although growth is reduced.\nSeeds germinate in late winter or early spring, but the life length is short. If kept moist, they can be stored in a cool place for a few months, but must be checked regularly for signs of germination. Low temperature prolongs dormancy. Sowing them as soon as ripe is better, either in cold frames or seedbeds outdoors, where they can be left \"in situ\" for one to two years before being planted in their permanent positions, or in pots, where the plants can be put out into their permanent positions in summer or autumn. They must be protected from the cold in their first winter, and also from mice and squirrels.\nChestnuts are considered self-sterile, so at least two trees are needed for pollination.\nSoil requirements.\n\"Castanea\" grows best in a soil with good drainage and adequate moisture. The tree prefers sloping, deep soils; it does not like shallow or heavy soils with impermeable, clay subsoils. The Chinese chestnut prefers a fertile, well-drained soil, but it grows well in fairly dry, rocky, or poor soils.\nAlthough \"Castanea\" can grow in very acidic soil, and while these soils are reasonably well tolerated, the preferred range is from pH 5.5-6.0. It does not grow well on alkaline soils, such as chalk, but thrives on soils such as those derived from granite, sandstone, or schist. On alkaline soils, chestnut trees can be grown by grafting them onto oak rootstocks. &lt;br&gt; Recently cleared land is best avoided to help resist the root rot, \"Armillaria mellia\".\nSun exposure.\n\"Castanea\" likes a full sun position. An experiment with \"C. dentata\" seedlings in Ohio confirmed the need for sun for optimal growth. The butt of the tree is sometimes painted with white paint to protect the tree from sunburn until it has developed enough canopy.\nWide spacing between the trees encourages low, broad crowns with maximum exposure to sunshine to increase fruit production. Where chestnut trees touch, virtually no fruit is produced. Current industrial planting spacings can range from 7 x 7 to 20 x 20 m. The closer plantings, which are more popular, mean quicker increases in short-term production, but heavy pruning or even tree removal is required later.\nWatering.\nThe optimum rainfall for chestnut trees is or more, ideally in even distribution throughout the year. Mulching during summer is recommended. Rainfall below per year needs be complemented with, for example, a drip irrigation system. This should water the soil at the outer half of the circle formed by the drip line to encourage root growth.\nIndependently from annual rainfall, watering young trees is recommended at least during summer and early autumn. Once established, they resist droughts well.\nPreservation.\nIn addition to being consumed fresh, chestnuts can also be canned, pureed, or preserved in sugar or syrup (\"marrons glac\u00e9s\"). Shelled and cooked nuts should be covered, refrigerated, and used within 3\u20134 days. Cooked chestnuts, either whole, chopped, or pureed, may be frozen in an airtight container and held up to 9 months. Because of their high water content, transpiration rates, and consequent loss weight, the nuts react as fresh fruits (not as nuts). They should be kept cool at all times, including in shops when on display for sale. To preserve their freshness for a few months with no artificial refrigeration, the chestnuts can be soaked in cold water for about 20 hours immediately after harvest, after which they are dried in the shade, then layered in dry sand. &lt;br&gt; Chestnuts behave similarly to seeds in that they produce very little ethylene, and their respiration rate is low, varying between 5 and 20\u00a0mg/(kg\u00b7h) depending on the temperature.\nCoppicing.\nMost chestnut wood production is done by coppice systems, cut on a 12-year rotation to provide small timber which does not split as badly as large logs. In southern England (particularly in Kent), sweet chestnut has traditionally been grown as coppices, being recut every 10 years or so on rotation for poles used for firewood, and fencing (fence posts and chestnut paling).\nSustainable forest management.\nAn excellent soil-enriching understory in pine forests,\nsustainable forest management incorporates more mixed plantings of proven efficiency, as opposed to monosylviculture. A study presented in 1997 has evaluated positively the potential increase in productivity with mixed stands and plantations, compared to plots of only one species. The relative yield total values of the mixed plantings steadily increase with time. \"C. sativa\" responds well to competitive pressure from \"Pseudotsuga menziesii\", the latter also showing a higher productivity. \"C. dentata\" seedlings in Ohio reforestation efforts are best achieved by planting them in places with little or no arboreous land cover, because of the need for light.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Table alignment/tables.css\" /&gt;\nProduction.\nIn 2020, world production of cultivated chestnuts was 2,322 tonnes, led by China with 75% of the total (table).\nUses.\nNutrition.\nChestnuts depart from the norm for culinary nuts, as they have little protein or fat; their calories come chiefly from carbohydrates. Fresh chestnut fruits provide about of food energy per 100\u00a0g of edible parts, which is much lower than walnuts, almonds, other nuts, and dried fruit (about per 100\u00a0g).\nIn some areas, sweet chestnut trees are called \"bread trees\". When chestnuts are just starting to ripen, the fruits are mostly starch and are firm under finger pressure from the high water content. As the chestnuts ripen, the starch is slowly converted into sugars, and moisture content decreases. Upon pressing the ripe chestnut, a slight \"give\" can be felt; the hull is not so tense, and space occurs between the flesh of the fruit and it.\nRaw chestnuts are 60% water and contain 44 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of protein, one gram of fat, supplying 200 calories in a 100-gram reference amount (table). Chestnuts provide some B vitamins and dietary minerals in significant content (table).\nTheir carbohydrate content compares with that of wheat and rice. Chestnuts have twice as much starch as the potato on an as-is basis. They contain about 8% of various sugars, mainly sucrose, glucose, fructose, and in lesser amounts, stachyose and raffinose, which are fermented in the lower gut, producing gas.\nChestnuts are among the few \"nuts\" that contain vitamin C, with 48% of the Daily Value in a 100-gram serving (table). The amount of vitamin C decreases by roughly 40% upon heating (typically, the vitamin is decreased or destroyed in heated foods). Fresh chestnuts contain about 52% water by weight, which evaporates relatively quickly during storage. They can lose as much as 1% of weight in one day at 20\u00a0\u00b0C (68\u00a0\u00b0F) and 70% relative humidity.\nCulinary.\nThe fruit can be peeled and eaten raw, but it can be somewhat astringent, especially if the pellicle is not removed.\nAnother method of eating the fruit involves roasting, which does not require peeling. Roasting requires scoring the fruit beforehand to prevent explosion of the fruit due to expansion. Once cooked, its texture is slightly similar to that of a baked potato, with a delicate, sweet, and nutty flavour. This method of preparation is popular in many countries, where the scored chestnuts may be cooked mixed with a little sugar.\nChestnuts can be dried and milled into flour, which can then be used to prepare breads, cakes, pies, pancakes, pastas, polenta (known in Corsica as \"pulenda\"), or used as thickener for stews, soups, and sauces. Chestnut cake may be prepared using chestnut flour. In Corsica, the flour is fried into doughnut-like fritters called \"fritelli\" and made into \"necci, pattoni, castagnacci,\" and \"cialdi\". The flour can be light beige like that from Castagniccia, or darker in other regions. It is a good solution for long storage of a nutritious food. Chestnut bread can stay fresh as long as two weeks.\nThe nuts can also be eaten candied, boiled, steamed, deep-fried, grilled, or roasted in sweet or savory recipes. They can be used to stuff vegetables, poultry, fowl, and other edibles. They are available fresh, dried, ground, or canned (whole or in puree).\nCandied chestnuts (whole chestnuts candied in sugar syrup, then iced) are sold under the French name \"marrons glac\u00e9s\" or Turkish name \"kestane \u015fekeri\" (\"sugared chestnuts\"). They appeared in France in the sixteenth century. Toward the end of nineteenth century, Lyon went into a recession with the collapse of the textile market, notably silk. Cl\u00e9ment Faugier, a civil engineer, was looking for a way to revitalize the regional economy. In 1882 at Privas, he invented the technology to make \"marrons glac\u00e9s\" on an industrial scale (although a great number of the more than 20 necessary steps from harvest to the finished product are still accomplished manually). Chestnuts are picked in autumn, and candied from the start of the following summer for the ensuing Christmas. Thus, the \"marrons glac\u00e9s\" eaten at Christmas are those picked the year before.\nIn Spain, on 31 October on the eve of the All Saints' Day, Catalonia celebrates \"la castanyada\", a festivity that consists of eating chestnuts, panellets, sweet potatoes and muscatell. On November, in the regions of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and other Northern provinces and Portugal, the \"Magosto\" is celebrated.\nIn Hungarian cuisine, cooked chestnuts are pur\u00e9ed, mixed with sugar (and usually rum), forced through a ricer, and topped with whipped cream to make a dessert called \"gesztenyep\u00fcr\u00e9\" (chestnut pur\u00e9e). In Swiss cuisine, a similar dish made with kirsch and butter is called \"vermicelles\". A French version is known as \"Mont Blanc\".\nA fine granular sugar can be obtained from the fermentation of the juice, as well as a beer; the roasted fruit provides a coffee substitute. Parmentier, who among other things was a famous potato promoter, extracted sugar from chestnuts and sent a chestnut sugarloaf weighing several pounds to the Academy of Lyon. The continental blockade following shortly after (1806\u20131814) increased the research into developing chestnuts as a source of sugar, but Napoleon chose beets instead.\nSweet chestnuts are not easy to peel when cold. One kilogram of untainted chestnuts yields about 700 g of shelled chestnuts.\nAnimal fodder and litter.\nChestnuts are often added to animal fodder. A first soak in limewater removes their bitter flavour, then they are ground and mixed with the ordinary provender. Other methods of preparation are also used. It is given to horses and cattle in the Orient, and to pigs in England, France and other places. The leaves are not as prone to be insect-eaten as those of the oak, and are also used for fodder.\nTimber.\nChestnut is of the same family as oak, and likewise its wood contains many tannins. This renders the wood very durable, gives it excellent natural outdoor resistance, and saves the need for other protection treatment. It also corrodes iron slowly, although copper, brass, or stainless metals are not affected.\nChestnut timber is decorative. Light brown in color, it is sometimes confused with oak wood. The two woods' textures are similar. When in a growing stage, with very little sap wood, a chestnut tree contains more timber of a durable quality than an oak of the same dimensions. Young chestnut wood has proved more durable than oak for woodwork that has to be partly in the ground, such as stakes and fences.\nAfter most growth is achieved, older chestnut timber tends to split and warp when harvested. The timber becomes neither so hard nor so strong as oak. The American chestnut \"C. dentata\" served as an important source of lumber, because it has long, unbranched trunks. In Britain, chestnut was formerly used indiscriminately with oak for the construction of houses, millwork, and household furniture. It grows so freely in Britain that it was long considered a truly native species, partly because the roof of Westminster Hall and the Parliament House of Edinburgh were mistakenly thought to be constructed of chestnut wood. Chestnut wood, however, loses much of its durability when the tree is more than 50 years old, and despite the local chestnut's quick growth rate, the timber used for these two buildings is considerably larger than a 50-year-old chestnut's girth. It has been proven that the roofs of these buildings are made of Durmast oak, which closely resembles chestnut in grain and color.\nIt is therefore uncommon to find large pieces of chestnut in building structures, but it has always been highly valued for small outdoor furniture pieces, fencing, cladding (shingles) for covering buildings, and pit-props, for which durability is an important factor. In Italy, chestnut is also used to make barrels used for aging balsamic vinegar and some alcoholic beverages, such as whisky or lambic beer. Of note, the famous 18th-century \"berles\" in the French C\u00e9vennes are cupboards cut directly from the hollowed trunk.\nFuel.\nDry, chestnut firewood is best burned in a closed log-burner, because of its tendency to spit when on an open fire.\nLeather.\nChestnut wood is a useful source of natural tannin and was used for tanning leather before the introduction of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark color to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content, which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; so it was not employed in this use. Chestnut tannin is obtained by hot-water extraction of chipped wood. It is an ellagic tannin and its main constituents are identified by castalagin (14.2%) and vescalagin (16.2%).&lt;br&gt;It has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content, and high acids content. This determines its astringency and its capability to fix raw hides. These properties make chestnut extract especially suitable for the tanning of heavy hides and to produce leather soles for high-quality shoes in particular. It is possible to obtain a leather with high yield in weight, which is compact, firm, flexible, and waterproof. Chestnut-tanned leathers are elastic, lightfast, resistant to traction and abrasion, and have warm color.\nChestnut tannin is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins (also known as hydrolysable tannin). As it tends to give a brownish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and valonia. &lt;br&gt; The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin than chestnut trees in northern climates.\nOther uses.\nFabric can be starched with chestnut meal. Linen cloth can be whitened with chestnut meal. The leaves and the skins (husk and pellicle) of the fruits provide a hair shampoo.\nHydrolysable chestnut tannins can be used for partial phenol substitution in phenolic resin adhesives production and also for direct use as resin.\nChestnut buds have been listed as one of the 38 substances used to prepare Bach flower remedies, a kind of alternative medicine promoted for its effect on health. However, according to Cancer Research UK, \"there is no scientific evidence to prove that flower remedies can control, cure or prevent any type of disease, including cancer\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is run at Longchamp Racecourse in Paris over a distance of 2,400 metres (1 mile 4 furlongs). The race is scheduled to take place each year in the autumn, usually on the first Sunday in October.\nWith prize money of \u20ac5\u00a0million, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, often referred to as the Arc, is Europe's richest flat race. The prize money and prestige of the race attract entries and spectators from across the world. Since 2008 the race has been sponsored by Qatar.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'Encouragement, a former governing body of French racing, had initially restricted its races to thoroughbreds born and bred in France. In 1863, it launched the Grand Prix de Paris, an event designed to bring together the best three-year-olds from any country. Thirty years later, it introduced the Prix du Conseil Municipal, an international race for the leading horses of different age groups. It was run over 2,400 metres in October, with weights determined by a horse's previous performances.\nThe creation of a third such race was proposed at a committee meeting on 24 January 1920. The new event would complement the Grand Prix de Paris and serve as a showcase for French thoroughbred breeding. It would have similar characteristics to the Prix du Conseil Municipal, but each horse would compete on equal terms, unpenalised for previous victories.\nComing in the wake of World War I, it was decided that the race would be named after the Arc de Triomphe, a famous monument which had been the scene of a victory parade by the Allies in 1919. The chosen title had been previously assigned to a minor event at Longchamp. Another suggested title was the \"Prix de la Victoire\".\nRace history.\nThe Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe was first run on Sunday, 3 October 1920. The inaugural running was won by Comrade, a three-year-old colt owned by Evremond de Saint-Alary. The winner's prize was 150,000 francs.\nIn 1935, the event secured state funding by the means of a Sweepstake. The system was first used in 1936, and it continued until 1938. The race was cancelled twice during World War II, in 1939 and 1940. It was run at Le Tremblay with a distance of 2,300 metres in 1943 and 1944.\nGovernment funding of the race resumed in 1949, with money obtained through the Loterie Nationale. Offering a jackpot of 50\u00a0million francs, this enabled a rapid increase of the prizes for both the Arc and its supporting races. By the 1970s, however, the assistance of the lottery had diminished, and the system was finally discontinued after the 1982 running. Since then, the race has had several sponsors, including Trusthouse Forte, CIGA Hotels and Groupe Lucien Barri\u00e8re.\nSince 2008, the race has been sponsored by Qatar. The Arc weekend includes seven races classed at Group 1 level, and four with Group 2 status. It also features the Arabian World Cup, the world's richest race for purebred Arabian horses, with \u20ac1 million in prize money.\nDue to renovations at the Hippodrome de Longchamp, the 2016 and 2017 editions of the race took place at Chantilly.\nRecords.\nMost successful horse (2 wins):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLeading jockey (6 wins):\nLeading trainer (8 wins):\nLeading owner (6 wins):\nFastest winning time \u2013 Found (2016), 2m 23.61s (at Chantilly)\nWidest winning margin \u2013 Ribot (1956), Sea Bird (1965) and Sakhee (2001), 6 lengths\nOldest winning horse \u2013 Motrico (1932), aged 7 years\nMost runners \u2013 30, in 1967\nFewest runners \u2013 7, in 1941\nWinners.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;a Cadum finished first in 1925, but he was relegated to second place for hampering Priori.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;b &lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;c The 1943 and 1944 editions were run at Le Tremblay over 2,300 metres.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;d Midnight Sun dead-heated for first in 1959, but he was placed second for hampering Saint Crespin.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;e Sagace finished first in 1985, but he was demoted to second for bumping Rainbow Quest.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Citation/styles.css\"/&gt;f The 2016 and 2017 runnings took place at Chantilly while Longchamp was closed for redevelopment.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67740", "revid": "50166619", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67740", "title": "American chestnut", "text": "Species of chestnut tree\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is a large, fast-growing deciduous tree of the beech family native to eastern North America. As is true of all species in the genus \"Castanea\", the American chestnut produces burred fruit with edible nuts. The American chestnut was once common in the Appalachian Mountain range and was a dominant species in the oak-chestnut forest region of its central and southern range.\nDuring the early to mid-20th century, American chestnut trees were devastated by chestnut blight, a fungal disease that came from Japanese chestnut trees that were introduced into North America from Japan. It is estimated that the blight killed between three and four billion American chestnut trees in the first half of the 20th century, beginning in 1904. Few mature American chestnuts exist within its former range, although many stumps and root systems continue to send up saplings. Most of these saplings get infected by chestnut blight, which girdles and kills them before they attain maturity. There are hundreds of large ( in diameter) American chestnuts outside its historical range, some in areas where less virulent strains of the pathogen are more common, such as the 600 to 800 large trees in Northern Michigan. The species is listed as endangered in Canada under the Species at Risk Act. American chestnuts are also susceptible to ink disease, particularly in the southern part of its native range; this likely contributed to the devastation of the species.\nSeveral groups are attempting to create blight-resistant American chestnuts. Scientists at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry created the Darling 58 cultivar by inserting the oxalate oxidase gene from wheat into the genome of an American chestnut. When expressed in the vascular cambium of the Darling 58 cultivar, the oxalate oxidase enzyme degrades the oxalic acid produced by the chestnut blight, reducing damage to the vascular cambium and resisting girdling of the trunk. As of 2021, the researchers who developed this cultivar are working toward applying for government permission to make these trees available to the public. If approved, these chestnut trees would be the first genetically modified forest trees released into the wild in the United States. Alternate approaches to developing a blight-resistant cultivar include cross-breeding among partially blight-resistant American chestnuts or crossbreeding with the moderately blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, then backcrossing with the American chestnut, with the goal of retaining most of its genes.\nDescription.\n\"Castanea dentata\" is a large, rapidly-growing, deciduous hardwood eudicot tree. A singular specimen manifest in Maine has attained a height of . Pre-blight sources give a maximum height of and a maximum circumference of . Post-blight sources erroneously report a greater maximum size of the species compared with pre-blight, likely the result of nostalgia, interpretations of pre-blight measurements of circumference as being measurements of diameter, and the misapprehension that pre-blight observations of maximum size represented observations of average size. It is considerably larger than the closely related Allegheny chinquapin (\"Castanea pumila\").\nThere are several other chestnut species, such as the European sweet chestnut (\"C. sativa\"), Chinese chestnut (\"C. mollissima\"), and Japanese chestnut (\"C. crenata\"). \"Castanea dentata\" can be distinguished by a few morphological traits, such as petiole length, nut size and number of nuts per burr, leaf shape, and leaf size, with leaves being long and broad\u2014slightly shorter and broader than the sweet chestnut. It has larger and more widely spaced saw-teeth on the edges of its leaves, as indicated by the scientific name \"dentata\", Latin for \"toothed\".\nThe European sweet chestnut was introduced in the United States by Thomas Jefferson in 1773. The European sweet chestnut has hairy twig tips in contrast to the hairless twigs of the American chestnut. This species has been the chief source of commercial chestnuts in the United States. Japanese chestnut was inadvertently introduced into the United States by Thomas Hogg in 1876 and planted on the property of S. B. Parsons in Flushing, New York. The Japanese chestnut has narrow leaves, smaller than either American chestnut or sweet chestnut, with small, sharply-pointed teeth and many hairs on the underside of the leaf and is the most blight-resistant species.\nThe chestnut is monoecious, and usually protandrous producing many small, pale green (nearly white) male flowers found tightly occurring along 6 to 8 inch long catkins. The female parts are found near the base of the catkins (near twig) and appear in late spring to early summer. Like all members of the family Fagaceae, American chestnut is self-incompatible and requires two trees for pollination, which can be with other members of the \"Castanea\" genus. The pollen is considered a mild allergen.\nThe American chestnut is a prolific bearer of nuts, with inflorescence and nut production in the wild beginning when a tree is 8 to 10 years old. Burrs often open while still attached to the tree, around the time of the first frost in autumn, with the nuts then falling to the ground. American chestnut typically have three nuts enclosed in a spiny, green burr, each lined in a tan velvet. In contrast, the Allegheny chinquapin produces one nut per burr.\nEvolution and ecology.\nChestnuts are in the Fagaceae family along with beech and oak. Chestnuts are not closely related to the horse chestnut, which is in the family Sapindaceae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates a westward migration of extant \"Castanea\" species from Asia to Europe to North America, with the American chestnut more closely related to the Allegheny chinquapin (\"Castanea pumila\" v. \"pumila\") than to European or Asian clades. The genomic range of chestnuts can be roughly divided into a clinal pattern of northeast, central, and southwest populations, with southwest populations showing greatest diversity, reflecting an evolutionary bottleneck likely caused by Quaternary glaciation. \nTwo lineages of American chestnut have been identified, one a hybrid between the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinquapin from the southern Appalachians. The other lineage shows a gradual loss of genetic diversity along a northward vector, indicating possible expansion of range following the most recent glacial maximum during the Wisconsin glaciation. Ozark chinkapin (\"C. ozarkensis\"), which is typically considered either a distinct species or a subspecies of the Allegheny chinquapin (\"C.\u00a0pumila\" subsp. \"ozarkensis\"), may be ancestral to both the American chestnut and the Allegheny chinquapin. A natural hybrid of \"C.\u00a0dentata\" and \"C.\u00a0pumila\" has been named \"Castanea\" \u00d7 \"neglecta\".\nThe American chestnut population was reduced to 1\u201310% of its original size as a result of the chestnut blight and has not recovered. The surviving trees are \"frozen in time\" with shoots re-sprouting from survivor rootstock but almost entirely undergoing blight-induced dieback without producing chestnuts. Unexpectedly, American chestnut appears to have retained substantial genetic diversity following the population bottleneck, which is at odds with the limited incidence of blight resistance/tolerance in extant populations.\nThe pre-blight distribution was restricted to moist, well-drained, steep slopes with acidic loam soils. According to analysis of old forest dust data, the tree was rare or absent in New England prior to 2,500 years before present but rapidly established dominance in these forests, becoming a common tree over a range from Maine and southern Ontario to Mississippi, and from the Atlantic coast to the Appalachian Mountains and the Ohio Valley. Within its range, the American chestnut was the dominant timber of mountain ridges and sandstone soils. Along the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, it dominated the area above the range of the Eastern hemlock and below 1,500 meters. In Western Maryland, it comprised 50% of ridge timber and 36% of forested slopes.\nThe tree's abundance was the result of a combination of rapid growth, relative fire resistance, and a large annual nut crop, in comparison to oaks, which do not reliably produce sizable numbers of acorns every year. Historically, the mean fire return interval was 20 years or less in chestnut-predominant ecologies, with a forest stand pattern that was more open than is currently the case.\nThe American chestnut was an important tree for wildlife, providing much of the fall mast for species such as white-tailed deer, wild turkey, Allegheny woodrat and (prior to its extinction) the passenger pigeon. Black bears were also known to eat the nuts to fatten up for the winter. The tree contains more nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium in its leaves than other trees that share its habitat, so they return more nutrients to the soil which helps with the growth of other plants, animals, and microorganisms. The American chestnut is preferred by some avian seed hoarders and was particularly important as a food source during years where the oak mast failed. The functional extinction of the American chestnut may have resulted in the extinction of some of the tree's host-specialist insect associates, including the Greater Chestnut Weevil.\nParasites.\nThe appearance of invasive pathogens of the American Chestnut into the eastern deciduous forest ecosystem is just one instance of the Columbian exchange of pathogens. While the Columbian exchange moved valuable crops between the Americas, Europe and Asia, there was also a downside, as the rapid introduction of invasive and unfamiliar pathogens resulted in serious damage or extinction of some host species.\nChestnut blight.\nPrior to the chestnut blight, the American chestnut was a dominant tree in the ecosystem of the eastern deciduous forest. It was said that a squirrel could walk from New England to Georgia solely on the branches of American chestnuts. Once an important hardwood timber tree, the American chestnut suffered a catastrophic population collapse due to the chestnut blight, a vascular disease caused by an Asian bark fungus (\"Cryphonectria parasitica\", formerly \"Endothia parasitica\"). The fungus was introduced when infected Japanese chestnut trees were brought to North America in the late 19th century. \nChestnut blight was first noticed on American chestnut trees in what was then the New York Zoological Park, now known as the Bronx Zoo, in the borough of The Bronx, New York City, in 1904, by chief forester Hermann Merkel. Merkel estimated that by 1906 blight had infected 98 percent of the chestnut trees in the borough. While Asian chestnut species evolved with the blight and developed a strong resistance, the American chestnut and Allegheny chinquapin have little resistance. \nThe airborne bark fungus spread per year and in a few decades girdled and killed more than three\u00a0billion American chestnut trees. Salvage logging during the early years of the blight may have unwittingly destroyed trees that had high levels of resistance to the disease and thus aggravated the calamity. New shoots often sprout from the roots when the main stem dies, so the species has not yet become extinct. However, the stump sprouts rarely reach more than in height before blight infection returns, so the species is classified as functionally extinct since the chestnut blight only actively kills the above ground portion of the American chestnut tree, leaving behind the below-ground components such as the root systems. \nIn the 1900s, it was recorded that the chestnut blight would commonly reinfect any novel stems that grew from the stumps, therefore maintaining a cycle that would prevent the American chestnut tree from re-establishing. However, some American chestnut trees have survived because of a small natural resistance to the chestnut blight.\nThe high density of American chestnuts within its range and the lack of natural immunity allowed the blight to spread quickly and cause infection and die-off in nearly every tree exposed. Early attempts to treat chestnut blight were both chemical, such as the use of fungicides, and physical, such as removing infected limbs through tree surgery and the removal of infected trees from cultivated and wild stands. Quarantine measures were also put into place, with the later support of the Plant Quarantine Act, which was an attempt to prevent the importation of other potential plant pathogens.\nThese attempts to contain the spread of chestnut blight were unsuccessful. The devastation of the species was worsened because the chestnut blight resulted in isolation of remaining specimens, resulting in asexual propagation of many isolated American chestnuts, low genetic diversity of stands of American chestnuts, and consequent vulnerability to extirpation.\nChestnut blight is not to be confused with sun scald, where winter sun reflects off of snow, warming the bark on the sun-facing trunk (this is the south-facing trunk in the Northern Hemisphere). This snow-reflected sunlight repeatedly warms and thaws the trunk during the day, resulting in vulnerability of the bark and cambium to freezing cold temperatures during the subsequent night, eventually resulting in bark cankers that resemble chestnut blight. Also, sun scald makes the damaged bark vulnerable to invasion by pathogens.\nOak wilt.\nAll chestnut species, including the American chestnut, are vulnerable to oak wilt \u2013 a vascular disease that occludes xylem vessels with tyloses, gums, and fungal hyphae . Oak wilt can kill chestnuts within weeks.\nInk disease.\nBefore the onset of chestnut blight and prior to 1824, an epidemic of ink disease struck American chestnuts, most likely brought to the southern United States on Cork oak trees imported from Portugal. This fungal pathogen is known to also kill the roots and collars of several \"Castanea\" species, including the European sweet chestnut. It affected primarily chestnuts in the Southeastern US and at the later time when chestnut blight struck, the range of \"C.\u00a0dentata\" may have already been reduced. The potential range of blight-resistant American chestnuts is substantially reduced if those chestnuts are susceptible to ink disease. \nThe range of this pathogen will extend northward as the climate warms, which may further limit the potential range of the American chestnut. Potassium phosphonate has been found to induce resistance to infection of \"C.\u00a0sativa\" by both inhibiting \"Phytophthora\" species directly and by improving the host response, inducing resistance to lesions in phloem tissue and formation of callus. Whether or not this effect would occur in \"C.\u00a0dentata\" is uncertain.\nChestnut brown nut rot.\nBrown nut rot is a destructive plant disease caused by the primary agent \"Gnomoniopsis castaneae\" and afflicting \"Castanea\" species. This pathogen also causes mild disease or exists as an endophyte in other hardwoods. The disease is found in Europe and Oceania. More recently, it has been reported in North America.\nChinese gall wasp.\nThe Chinese gall wasp attacks all chestnut species and causes heavy damage. As this species of wasp is a threat to saplings, and is now widely-present in eastern North American forests, it is a potential problem for reintroduction of the American chestnut. The Chinese parasitoid chalcid wasp \"Torymus sinensis\" Kamijo is considered an effective control method for the Chinese gall wasp. There are now established populations of \"Torymus sinensis\" in North America.\nReduced population.\nAmerican chestnuts were a common part of the forest canopy in much of its original range. Although large trees are currently rare east of the Mississippi River, they exist in pockets in the blight-free West, where the habitat was agreeable for planting: settlers took seeds with them in the 19th century. Huge planted chestnut trees can be found in Sherwood, Oregon, as the Mediterranean climate of the West Coast discourages the fungus, which relies on hot, humid summer weather. American chestnut also thrives as far north as Revelstoke, British Columbia.\nAt present, it is believed that survival of \"C.\u00a0dentata\" for more than a decade in its native range is almost impossible. The fungus uses various oak trees as a host, and while the oak is unaffected, American chestnuts nearby will succumb to the blight in approximately a year or more. In addition, the hundreds of chestnut stumps and \"living stools\" dotting eastern woodlands may still contain active pathogens. It is considered extirpated from Florida and Illinois.\nThe reduced population of American chestnuts directly impacted many species of insects that relied upon the tree species for survival. Of approximately 60 species that feed upon the American chestnut, seven rely entirely on the American chestnut as a food source. Some of these, like the American chestnut moth, are now extinct or severely reduced in population.\nAttempts at restoration.\nTransgenic blight-resistant American chestnut.\nResearchers at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY ESF) have developed the Darling 58 chestnut cultivar. This cultivar expresses the gene for wheat oxalate oxidase enzyme, which breaks down the oxalic acid produced by the blight fungus, preventing the death of the tree. When pollen of transgenic fathers fertilizes an ovule of a native mother in the field, those resulting seedlings that express the oxalate oxidase enzyme show growth similar to non-transgenic full siblings, indicating that the transgene does not impede growth under field conditions. The modified chestnut does not affect survival, pollen use, or reproduction of bumble bees. A deregulation petition for the Darling 58 variant has been submitted. If approved, these trees could be the first genetically modified forest trees released in the wild in the United States.\nUnlike American chestnut, Japanese chestnut exhibits resistance to \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\", the fungal pathogen that causes ink disease. The mechanism of resistance of \"C.\u00a0crenata\" to \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\" may derive from its expression of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene (99.6% identical with https://). Transgenic modification of \"C.\u00a0dentata\" with the Cast_Gnk2-like gene may provide a mechanism for developing American chestnut trees resistant to \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\". Stacking of the Cast_Gnk2-like gene and the oxalate oxidase gene may provide a means of developing genetically modified American chestnut trees resistant to both the chestnut blight and to ink disease.\nThe American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at SUNY-ESF is not pursuing intellectual property protection through patents. Dr William Powell, the project's co-director, states that the decision to not pursue a patent on the project's transgenic lines was to allow the plant to be more accessible for conservationists and members of the public. Powell posits that a patent would constrain the spread of the oxalate oxidase transgene into American chestnut populations by limiting the ability to freely plant transgenic trees and cross the trees with surviving American chestnuts or the hybrids produced in the backcross program. Powell states that patents would be a barrier to chestnut restoration and in direct opposition to the program's goals of collaboration. While patent protection is not sought, the non-profit American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) maintains control through a Germplasm Agreement, ensuring authorized use of chestnut germplasm. The agreement safeguards TACF's rights and aligns with the organization's restoration goals.\nA laboratory error resulted in mistaken use of the Darling 54 cultivar instead of the Darling 58 cultivar in some field trials. TACF and colleagues have also reported decreased growth rates, and poor heritability of resistance of the Darling 58 cultivar. In response, the American Chestnut Foundation withdrew its support of development of the Darling 58 cultivar in December 2023. The American Chestnut Research &amp; Restoration Program at SUNY ESF is continuing to pursue deregulation.\nIn 2022, the SUNY ESF group developed transgenic American chestnut trees incorporating both the oxalate oxidase transgene from wheat and the win3.12 promoter transgene from the necklace poplar. Unlike the CAMV 35S promoter which acts at all times, this poplar promoter drives OxO expression at a low level under basal conditions, but elevates to high levels under conditions of wounding or tissue infection. In laboratory bioassays, win3.12-OxO lines showed elevated disease tolerance similar to that exhibited by blight-resistant Chinese chestnut. Limiting expression of the OxO gene to blight infected tissues is expected to reduce the metabolic cost of gene expression, resulting in increased competitiveness of these new cultivars. As of January 2025, the win3.12 OxO chestnut is still in the research and development phase and has not been deployed for restoration purposes.\nIntercrossing surviving American chestnuts.\nAmerican Chestnut Cooperators' Foundation (ACCF) is not using crosses with Asian species for blight resistance, but intercrossing among American chestnuts selected for native resistance to the blight, a breeding strategy described by the ACCF as \"All-American intercrosses\". John Rush Elkins, a research chemist and professor emeritus of chemistry at Concord University, and Gary Griffin, professor of plant pathology at Virginia Tech, think there may be several different characteristics which favor blight resistance. Both Elkins and Griffin have written extensively about the American chestnut. They believe that by making intercrosses among resistant American chestnuts from many locations, they will continue to improve upon the levels of blight resistance to make an American chestnut that can compete in the forest.\nGriffin, who has been involved with American chestnut restoration for many years, developed a scale for assessing levels of blight resistance, which made it possible to make selections scientifically. He inoculated five-year-old chestnuts with a standard lethal strain of the blight fungus and measured growth of the cankers. Chestnuts with no resistance to blight make rapid-growing, sunken cankers that are deep and kill tissue right to the wood. Resistant chestnuts make slow-growing, swollen cankers that are superficial: live tissue can be recovered under these cankers. The level of blight resistance is judged by periodic measurement of cankers.\nGrafts from large survivors of the blight epidemic were evaluated following inoculations, and controlled crosses among resistant American chestnut trees were made beginning in 1980. The first \"All-American intercrosses\" were planted in Virginia Tech's Martin American Chestnut Planting in Giles County, Virginia, and in Beckley, West Virginia. They were inoculated in 1990 and evaluated in 1991 and 1992. Nine of the trees showed resistance equal to their parents. Four of these had resistance comparable to hybrids in the same test. \nMany ACCF chestnuts have expressed blight resistance equal to or greater than an original blight survivor but so far, only a handful have demonstrated superior, durable blight control. Time will tell if the progeny of these best chestnuts exhibit durable blight resistance in different stress environments.\nBackcrossing.\nBackcrossing as a treatment for blight was first proposed by Charles Burnham of the University of Minnesota in the 1970s. Burnham, a professor emeritus in agronomy and plant genetics who was considered one of the pioneers of maize genetics, realized that experiments conducted by the USDA to cross-breed American chestnuts with European and Asian chestnuts erroneously assumed that a large number of genes were responsible for blight resistance, while it is currently believed the number of responsible genes is low. The USDA abandoned their cross-breeding program and destroyed local plantings around 1960 after failing to produce a blight-resistant hybrid. \nBurnham's recognition of the USDA's error led to him joining with others to create The American Chestnut Foundation in 1983, with the sole purpose of breeding a blight-resistant American chestnut. The American Chestnut Foundation is backcrossing blight-resistant Chinese chestnut into American chestnut trees, to recover the American growth characteristics and genetic makeup, and then finally intercrossing the advanced backcross generations to eliminate genes for susceptibility to blight. \nThe first backcrossed American chestnut tree, called \"Clapper\", survived blight for 25 years, and grafts of the tree have been used by The American Chestnut Foundation since 1983. The Pennsylvania chapter of The American Chestnut Foundation, which seeks to restore the American chestnut to the forests of the Mid-Atlantic states, has planted over 22,000 trees.\nThe Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 requires owners of abandoned coal mines to cover at least 80 percent of their land with vegetation. While many companies planted invasive grasses, others began funding research on planting trees, because they can be more cost-effective, and yield better results. Keith Gilland began planting American chestnut trees in old strip mines in 2008 as a student at Miami University, and to date has planted over 5,000 trees. In 2005, a hybrid tree with mostly American genes was planted on the lawn of the White House. \nA tree planted in 2005 in the tree library outside the USDA building was still very healthy seven years later. It contains 98% American chestnut DNA and 2% Chinese chestnut DNA. This tree contains enough Chinese chestnut DNA that encodes for systemic resistance genes to resist the blight. This is essential for restoring the American chestnut trees into the Northeast. The Northern Nut Growers Association (NNGA) has also been active in pursuing viable hybrids. \nFrom 1962 to 1990, Alfred Szego and other members of the NNGA developed hybrids with Chinese varieties which showed limited resistance. Initially the backcrossing method would breed a hybrid from an American chestnut nut and a Chinese chestnut, the hybrid would then be bred with a normal American chestnut, subsequent breeding would involve a hybrid and an American chestnut or two hybrids, which would increase the genetic makeup of the hybrids primarily American chestnut but still retain the blight resistance of the Chinese chestnut.\nA backcross breeding program has integrated desirable American chestnut traits with traits from the Chinese chestnut, achieving intermediate resistance to \"Cryphonectria parasitica\" and \"Phytophthora cinnamomi\" in the hybrid genome.\nThe B3F3 strain, a product of backcrossing and intercrossing with selection for blight resistance, is approximately 94% American chestnut and 6% Chinese chestnut and has been planted experimentally in Maryland in an orchard.\nHypovirulence.\nHypovirus is the only genus in the family Hypoviridae. Members of this genus infect fungal pathogens and reduce their ability to cause disease (hypovirulence). In particular, the virus infects \"Cryphonectria parasitica\", the fungus that causes chestnut blight, which has enabled infected trees to recover from the blight. The use of hypovirulence to control blight originated in Europe where the fungal virus spread naturally through populations of European chestnuts. The reduced ability of the fungus to cause disease allowed the European chestnut to regenerate, creating large stands of trees. Hypovirulence has also been found in North America, but has not spread effectively. \nThe \"Arner Tree\" of Southern Ontario is one of the best examples of naturally occurring hypovirulence. It is a mature American chestnut that has recovered from severe infections of chestnut blight. The cankers have healed over and the tree continues to grow vigorously. Scientists have discovered that the chestnut blight remaining on the tree is hypovirulent, although isolates taken from the tree do not have the fungal viruses found in other isolates. \nTrees inoculated with isolates taken from the Arner tree have shown moderate canker control. The cankers of hypovirulent American chestnut trees occur on the outermost tissues of the tree but the cankers do not spread into the growth tissues of the American chestnut tree, thereby providing it with a resistance.\nUses.\nFood.\nThe nuts were once an important economic resource in North America, being sold on the streets of towns and cities, as they sometimes still are during the Christmas season (usually said to be \"roasting on an open fire\" because their smell is readily identifiable many blocks away). Chestnuts are edible raw or roasted, though typically preferred roasted. One must peel the brown skin to access the yellowish-white edible portion.\nThe nuts were commonly fed on by various types of wildlife and was also in such a high abundance that they were used to feed livestock by farmers, by allowing those livestock to roam freely into the forests that were predominantly filled with American chestnut trees. The tree was important to many Native American tribes in North America as it served as a food source, both for them and the wildlife they hunted, and also as a component in traditional medicine.\nFurniture and other wood products.\nThe January 1888 issue of \"Orchard and Garden\" mentions the American chestnut as being \"superior in quality to any found in Europe\". The wood is straight-grained, strong, and easy to saw and split, and it lacks the radial end grain found on most other hardwoods. The tree was particularly valuable commercially since it grew at a faster rate than oaks. Being rich in tannins, the wood was highly resistant to decay and therefore used for a variety of purposes, including furniture, split-rail fences, shingles, home construction, flooring, piers, plywood, paper pulp, and telephone poles. Tannins were also extracted from the bark for tanning leather. Although larger trees are no longer available for milling, much chestnut wood has been reclaimed from historic barns to be refashioned into furniture and other items.\n\"Wormy\" chestnut refers to a defective grade of wood that has insect damage, having been sawn from long-dead, blight-killed trees. This \"wormy\" wood has since become fashionable for its rustic character.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This necrotrophic fungus is native to East Asia and South East Asia and was introduced into Europe and North America in the early 1900s. Strains of the fungus spread more or less rapidly and caused significant tree loss in both regions. Strains of the fungus can be more or less virulent.\nOverview.\n\"Cryphonectria parasitica\" is a parasitic fungus of chestnut trees. This disease came to be known as chestnut blight. Naturally found in South East Asia, accidental introductions led to invasive populations of \"C. parasitica\" in North America and Europe. In the first half of the 20th century, the fungal disease had a devastating economic and social impact on communities in the eastern United States. It killed an estimated four billion trees; or, by another count, 3.5 billion trees through 2013. Less severe impacts have occurred in Europe due to widespread CHV1-induced \"hypovirulence\". CHV1 is one of at least two viral pathogens that weaken the fungus through hypovirulence and helps trees survive a blight infection.\nThe American chestnut (\"Castanea dentata\") and American chinquapin (\"Castanea pumila\") are highly susceptible to chestnut blight. The European chestnut (\"Castanea sativa\") is also susceptible, but due to widespread CHV1 hypovirulence, blight-induced tree death is less common. The fungus can infect other tree species such as oaks, red maples, staghorn sumacs, and shagbark hickories. Once infected, these trees' bark also exhibit orange cankers but may not die. The pathogen can persist in these trees, producing spores that may infect other trees.\nFungal strains spread by wind-borne ascospores and, over a shorter distance, conidia distributed by rain-splash action. Infection can be local in range, so some isolated American chestnuts survive where there is no other infected tree within . Soil organisms at the root collar and root system of the chestnut tree are antagonistic to the fungus. Chestnut tree roots are resistant to blight infections. Consequently, a large number of small American chestnut trees still exist as shoots growing from existing root bases. However, these regrown shoots seldom reach the sexually reproductive stage before above ground growth is again girdled by the fungus.\nFungal strains originally infected the Chinese chestnut (\"Ca. mollissima\") and the Japanese chestnut (\"Ca. crenata\"). These two species have co-evolved with the pathogen, making them most variably resistant to its ill effects.\nHistory.\nInfections in North America.\nIn 1904, the chestnut blight was accidentally introduced to North America. \"Cryphonectria parasitica\" was introduced into the United States from East Asia via import of Japanese chestnut trees. Commercial breeding purposes motivated these imports. Infection of American chestnut trees with \"C. parasitica\" simultaneously appeared in numerous places on the East Coast, most likely from Japanese chestnuts, which had become popular imports.\nHerman W. Merkel, a forester at the New York Zoological Garden (Bronx Zoo) first found infected chestnut trees on the grounds of the zoo. \nIn 1905, American mycologist William Murrill isolated and described the fungus responsible (which he named \"Diaporthe parasitica\"), and demonstrated by inoculation into healthy plants that the fungus caused the disease. By 1940, most mature American chestnut trees had been girdled by the disease. It took about 40 years to devastate the nearly four-billion-strong American chestnut population in North America. Only a few clumps of uninfected trees remained in Michigan, Wisconsin, and the Pacific Northwest.\nJapanese and Chinese chestnut trees may resist an infection from \"C. parasitica\". Because of the disease, American chestnut wood almost disappeared from the market for decades, although it can still be obtained as reclaimed lumber.\nIt is estimated that in some places, such as the Appalachian Mountains, one in every four hardwoods was an American chestnut. Mature trees often grew straight and branch-free for 50 feet and could grow up to 100 feet tall with a trunk diameter of 14 feet at a few feet above ground level. The reddish-brown wood was lightweight, soft, easy to split, very resistant to decay, and did not warp or shrink. For three centuries many barns and homes near the Appalachian Mountains were made from American chestnut. Its straight-grained wood was ideal for building furniture and caskets. The bark and wood were rich in tannic acid, which provided tannins for use in the tanning of leather.\nChestnuts were an important cash crop and food source. Many native animals fed on chestnuts, and chestnuts were used for livestock feed, which kept the cost of raising livestock low.\nEfforts started in the 1930s and are still ongoing, in Massachusetts and many other places in the United States, to repopulate chestnut trees. Surviving American chestnut trees are being bred for resistance to the blight, notably by The American Chestnut Foundation, which aims to reintroduce a blight-resistant American chestnut to its original forest range within the early decades of the 21st century. Japanese chestnut and Chinese chestnut, as well as Seguin's chestnut and Henry's chestnut, have been used in these breeding programs in the US to create disease-resistant hybrids with the American chestnut. Chinese chestnut trees have been found to have the highest resistance to chestnut blight; however, individuals within the Chinese chestnut species may vary in blight resistance. Some individuals are still quite susceptible while others are essentially immune.\nHypovirulence is not widespread in the US and attempts to commercially introduce CHV1 virus have not been widely successful . Though CHV1 persists in applied trees, it does not spread naturally as it does in Europe , preventing it from being an effective form of biocontrol.\nInfections in Europe.\nIn 1938, chestnut blight was first identified around Genoa. Infection quickly spread and was identified in France in 1946, Switzerland in 1951, and Greece in 1963. It has most recently been found in the UK. Due to genetic differences between the fungal populations (strains), it is likely that a second introduction of chestnut blight occurred in Georgia and Azerbaijan in 1938. The fungal infections initially caused widespread tree death in Europe. However, in the early 1950s trees were identified in Italy that survived fungal infection. On these trees, the fungus caused more superficial cankers, that appeared to be healing. The milder infection outcome was due to the presence of CHV1, an RNA virus that infects \"C. parasitica\". CHV1 spread naturally throughout Europe but is also spread artificially as a biocontrol measure (particularly in France). CHV1 is currently not present in the UK, Northern France, or Eastern Georgia but an introduction for biocontrol is being considered. \nSymptoms.\nThe fungus enters through wounds on susceptible trees and grows in and beneath the bark, eventually killing the cambium all the way around the twig, branch, or trunk. The first symptom of \"C. parasitica\" infection is a small orange-brown area on the tree bark. A sunken canker then forms as the mycelial fan spreads under the bark. As the hyphae spread, they produce several toxic compounds, the most notable of which is oxalic acid. This acid lowers the pH of the infected tissue from around the normal 5.5 to approximately 2.8, which is toxic to cambium cells. The canker eventually girdles the tree, killing everything above it. Distinctive yellow tendrils (cirrus) of conidia can be seen extruding in wet weather.\nLife cycle and reproduction.\nThe primary plant tissues targeted by \"C. parasitica\" are the inner bark, an area containing the conductive tissue, and the cambium, a layer of actively dividing cells that give rise to secondary vascular tissues. In these tissues, the pathogen forms diffuse cankers in which the mycelium overwinters. In the following spring, two types of fruiting bodies will form: pycnidia, usually first, and perithecia. Following rainfall, the pycnidia ooze orange tendrils of conidia, the asexual spores, while perithecia forcibly eject ascospores, the sexual spores. Upon becoming airborne, ascospores are carried by eddies of wind to new hosts or infect other parts of the same tree. When insects, birds, or other wildlife come into contact with the cankers, they can mechanically disperse the conidia to a new host. Additionally, the asexual spores can be dispersed by rain splash. Once on the new host, or new area of the tree, the spores can germinate and infect the inner bark through insect wounds and fissures in the outer bark.\nIf cankers continue to form and expand, the fungus can girdle the stem, severing the flow of nutrients and water to the vital vegetative tissues. The absence of nutrient dispersal will result in above ground tree death. However, the root system may survive. As a result, American chestnuts exist mainly as shrubs sprouting from the old, surviving roots. These sprouts usually die of infection by \"C. parasitica\" before reaching sexual maturity.\nManagement: hypovirulence, sanitation, and chemical control.\nIn Europe, during the late 1960s, it was found that a strain of \"C. parasitica\" was less virulent, only able to produce shallow cankers that the tree's callus tissue could eventually limit and isolate. The trait of hypovirulence could be transferred from an avirulent strain to a lethal strain through anastomosis\u2014the fusion of hyphae. It was later discovered that this attenuated virulence was due to infection by a dsRNA mycovirus, \"Cryphonectria hypovirus 1\" (CHV1) of genus \"Hypovirus\".\nConsidering the nature of hypovirulent strains, there has been a strong interest to use them to manage lethal \"C. parasitica\" strains. In Europe, natural dissemination of hypovirulence in pathogen populations resulted in the restoration of economically valuable chestnuts. Unfortunately, this was not the case in the United States. Compared to Europe, the US has a greater diversity of \"C. parasitica\" strains. Thus, the spread of the mycovirus in American \"C. parasitica\" populations is inhibited by vegetative incompatibility, an allorecognition system that inhibits the fusion of hyphae between individuals that are genetically distinct at specific loci. In 2016, however, \"super mycovirus donor strains\" of \"C. parasitica\" were engineered to overcome this incompatibility system. This could potentially be employed as a method of biological control.\nAs mentioned above some soil microorganisms suppress \"C. parasitica\". This can be used to treat the cankers, by using a soil compress, a quantity of soil held against the trunk itself with plastic wrap and some adhesive tape around that.\nIn addition to biocontrol, chestnut blight can also be managed by sanitation practices and chemical control; however, such management strategies are only feasible on a small scale, such as in an orchard. Sanitation practices like the pruning of symptomatic limbs and removal of infected trees can serve to eliminate sources of inoculum and limit the spread of the pathogen.\nAdditionally, some fungicides may be effective at controlling this fungal disease. A study on the chemical control of chestnut blight in \"Castanea sativa\", may have found that the external application of both copper oxychloride and carbendazim could reduce the rate of disease by almost 50%.\nConservation efforts in North America.\nThere are approximately 2,500 chestnut trees growing on near West Salem, Wisconsin, which is the world's largest remaining stand of American chestnut. These trees are the descendants of those planted by Martin Hicks, an early settler in the area. In the late 1800s, Hicks planted fewer than a dozen chestnuts. Planted outside the natural range of American chestnut, these trees escaped the initial wave of infection by chestnut blight, but in 1987 scientists found blight also in this stand. There is a program to bring American chestnut back to the Eastern forest funded by the American Chestnut Foundation, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, USDA Forest Service, West Virginia University, Michigan State University, and Cornell University.\nRemoving blighted trees to control the disease was first attempted when the blight was discovered, but this proved to be an ineffective solution. Scientists then set out to introduce a hyperparasitic hypovirus into the chestnut blight fungus. The trees infected with virus-treated fungus responded immediately and began to heal over their cankers. However, the virus was so efficient at attenuating fungal growth that it prevented the spreading of the virus from an infected fungus growing on one tree to that growing on another tree. Only the virus-treated trees recovered. Scientific opinion regarding the future of the stand varies.\nHybrid chestnut trees.\nCurrent efforts are underway by the Forest Health Initiative to use modern breeding techniques and genetic engineering to create resistant tree strains, with contributions from SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Pennsylvania State University, the University of Georgia, and the United States Forest Service. One of the most successful methods of breeding is to create a back cross of a resistant species (such as one from China or Japan) and American chestnut. Researchers identified two or three genes that allow for blight resistance, and are focusing on giving the American chestnut hybrids only those genes from the Chinese or Japanese chestnut.\nThe two species are first bred to create a 50/50 hybrid. After three backcrosses with American chestnut, the remaining genome is approximately 1/16 that of the resistant tree and 15/16 American. The strategy is to select blight-resistance genes during the backcrossing while preserving the more wild-type traits of American chestnut as the dominant phenotype. Thus, the newly bred hybrid chestnut trees should reach the same heights as the original American chestnut. Many of these 15/16 American chestnut hybrids have been planted along the East Coast, including in the Jefferson National Forest and on the Flight 93 National Memorial. Some of these sites have had researchers check on the saplings that have been planted to see their survival rate. For the hybrids to do well, they need areas with decent drainage and abundant sunlight. Meeting these needs can be hard to do, so not all restoration areas have been successful with hybrid survival.\nTransgenic blight-resistant chestnut trees.\nA 1983 study on hypovirulence had shown that chestnut blight infected with hypovirus produced less oxalic acid when attacking the cambium. Meanwhile, a plant pathologist, Dr. William Powell, had been trying to figure out how to transfer all of the Asian chestnut's resistance genetics to its American relatives. In the 1990s, he had the idea to give up on the more complicated and larger job, and instead look around for a single gene elsewhere. (In related work, in 2001 Liang, Mayard, Allen, and Powell successfully inserted an oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene from wheat into \"Populus \u00d7 euramericana\" (\"Ogy\") for \"Septoria musiva\" resistance. This enzyme breaks down the oxalic acid secreted by the fungus into carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide.) In 2007, Welch, Stipanovic, Maynard, and Powell showed that transgenic \"C. dentata\" expressing a wheat OxO indeed had lower lignin degradation by oxalic acid, and suggested this was the path to take.\nA few years later this line of research culminated in the final product: Powell and another plant pathologist, Dr. Charles Maynard, working at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry developed American chestnuts which had heightened blight resistance. Heightened resistance was attained by introducing a wheat OxO gene into the American chestnut genome. (Because an unrelated gene was transferred, this did not make the chestnut trees produce gluten, and the nuts remain gluten free.) The transgenic trees have blight resistance either equal to or surpassing that of \"Castanea mollissima\", Chinese chestnuts. \nIn 2013, SUNY ESF had over 100 individual events being tested, with more than 400 slated to be in the field or in the lab for various assay tests in the next several years. By 2014, more than 1,000 trees were growing in several field sites. Government approval will be required before returning any of these blight resistant trees to the wild. The New York Botanical Garden has planted several of the transgenic trees for public display. \nAt the start, there were few such engineered chestnut trees. For seed multiplication, grafting could work. Normal tree growth requires 6, 7, or even 8 years before a chestnut will flower. However orchard management may accelerate pollen production to 2\u20133 years (although still without fruiting). Powell's lab had been able to use growth chambers with higher light inputs to get duration to pollen production down to less than a year.\nThe American Chestnut Foundation (TACF) once worked closely with SUNY ESF to utilize the Darling 58 in their mission to restore the American chestnut to its native range in the eastern United States. However, in December 2023, TACF withdrew its petition for use as a restorative species due to poor performance and high mortality in Darling 54 saplings. \nEconomic and ecological impact of disease.\nIn less than fifty years after its emergence, \"C. parasitica\" virtually eliminated American chestnut as a canopy species in of forest. The chestnut fruit was a major food source for animals in the low elevation Appalachian forests. This loss resulted in a drastic decrease in the squirrel population, the extinction of seven native moth species, and the slowed recovery of deer, Cooper's hawk, cougar, and bobcat populations. The effects of this disease also rippled further through the ecosystem, being linked to a decrease in the abundance of cavity-nesting birds and to a decrease in river water quality which negatively affected aquatic invertebrate populations.\nIn 1912, standing chestnut timber in just three states was estimated to be $82.5\u00a0million ($1.9\u00a0billion in 2009 dollars) in value. Therefore, in addition to ecological impacts, \"C. parasitica\" potentially caused a devastating loss in economic welfare for communities dependent on the chestnut tree. Mountaineers, residents of Appalachian Mountain communities, had to drastically alter their lifestyles to cope with the effects of this disease.\nEconomic effects have also been considerable in Europe, particularly before CHV1 spreads naturally to a region. In Greece for example, the disease forced the migration of people who could no longer afford to live off chestnut trees. It has also led to a 40% decline in Greek chestnut production.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Its invention gave rise to the caplock mechanism or percussion lock system which used percussion caps struck by the hammer to set off the gunpowder charge in rifles and cap and ball firearms. Any firearm using a caplock mechanism is a percussion gun. Any long gun with a cap-lock mechanism and rifled barrel is a percussion rifle. Cap and ball describes cap-lock firearms discharging a single bore-diameter spherical bullet with each shot.\nDescription.\nThe percussion cap is a small cylinder of copper or brass with one closed end. Inside the closed end is a small amount of a shock-sensitive explosive material such as mercury fulminate (discovered in 1800; it was the only practical detonator used from about the mid-19th century to the early 20th century).\nThe caplock mechanism consists of a hammer and a \"nipple\" (sometimes referred to as a \"cone\"). The nipple contains a hollow conduit which goes into the rearmost part of the gun barrel, and the percussion cap is placed over the nipple hole. Pulling the trigger releases the hammer, which strikes the percussion cap against the nipple (which serves as an anvil), crushes it and detonates the mercury fulminate inside, which releases sparks that travel through the hollow nipple into the barrel and ignite the main powder charge.\nPercussion caps have been made in small sizes for pistols and larger sizes for rifles and muskets.\nOrigins.\nEarlier firearms used flintlock mechanisms causing a piece of flint to strike a steel frizzen producing sparks to ignite a pan of priming powder and thereby fire the gun's main powder charge. The flintlock mechanism replaced older ignition systems such as the matchlock and wheellock, but all were prone to misfire in wet weather.\nThe discovery of fulminates was made by Edward Charles Howard (1774\u20131816) in 1800. The invention that made the percussion cap possible using the recently discovered fulminates was patented by the Reverend Alexander John Forsyth of Belhelvie, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, in 1807. The rudimentary percussion system was invented by Forsyth as a solution to the problem that birds would startle when smoke puffed from the powder pan of his flintlock shotgun, giving them sufficient warning to escape the shot. This early percussion lock system operated in a nearly identical fashion to flintlock firearms and used a fulminating primer made of fulminate of mercury, chlorate of potash, sulphur and charcoal, ignited by concussion. His invention of a fulminate-primed firing mechanism deprived the birds of their early warning system, both by avoiding the initial puff of smoke from the flintlock powder pan, as well as shortening the interval between the trigger pull and the shot leaving the muzzle. Forsyth patented his \"scent bottle\" ignition system in 1807. However, it was not until after Forsyth's patents expired that the conventional percussion cap system was developed. Joseph Manton invented a precursor to the percussion cap in 1814, comprising a copper tube that detonated when crushed. This was further developed in 1822 by the English-born American artist Joshua Shaw, as a copper cup filled with fulminates.\nThe first purpose-built caplock guns were fowling pieces commissioned by sportsmen in Regency era England. Due to the mechanism's compactness and superior reliability compared to the flintlock, gunsmiths were able to manufacture pistols and long guns with two barrels. Early caplock handguns with two or more barrels and a single lock are known as turn-over or twister pistols, due to the need to manually rotate the second barrel to align with the hammer. With the addition of a third barrel, and a ratchet to mechanically turn the barrels while cocking the hammer, these caplock pistols evolved into the pepper-box revolver during the 1830s.\nThe caplock offered many improvements over the flintlock. The caplock was easier and quicker to load, more resilient to weather conditions, and far more reliable than the flintlock. Many of the older flintlock weapons were later converted to the caplock, so that they could take advantage of these features.\nParallel developments.\nJoshua Shaw is sometimes credited (primarily by himself) with the development of the first metallic percussion cap in 1814, a reusable one made of iron, then a disposable pewter one in 1815 and finally a copper one in 1816. There is no independent proof of this since Shaw was advised he could not patent it due to Alexander Forsyth's patent for using fulminates to ignite guns being in force between 1807 and 1821. Shaw says he only shared the development of his innovation with a few associates (gunmakers and others) who were sworn to secrecy and never provided affidavits at a later date. Shaw's claim to have been the inventor remains clouded in controversy as he did not patent the idea until 1822, having moved to America in 1817. According to Lewis Winant, the US government's decision to award Shaw $25,000 as compensation for his invention being used by the Army was a mistake. Congress believed Shaw's patent was the earliest in the world and awarded him a large sum of money based on this belief. The investigators had overlooked two French patents and the earlier use of the idea in Britain.\nThe earliest known patent anywhere in the world which specifically mentions a percussion cap and nipple was granted in France on 29 July 1818 to Fran\u00e7ois Pr\u00e9lat, four years before Shaw's patent. Prelat made a habit of copying English patents and inventions and the mode of operation he describes is flawed. Secondly a French patent of a percussion cap and nipple had been granted in 1820 to Deboubert. However predating both of these French claims, the most likely inventor of the percussion cap, according to historian Sidney James Gooding, was (nephew of Durs Egg), around 1817, .\nThere were other earlier claims. Col. Peter Hawker in 1830 simultaneously claimed and denied being the inventor. \"I do not wish to say I was the inventor of it - very probably not\" but then immediately recounts that he came up with the idea of simplifying a Manton patch-lock, which could be troublesome, by designing a cap and nipple arrangement around 1816 when the patch lock was patented. He says he then presented a drawing to a reluctant Joseph Manton to make a few copper cap guns which were then sold. Hawker, seems to give Joseph Manton more of the glory eight years later in the 1838 edition of his 'Instructions to young Sportsmen', by stating categorically that \"copper tubes and primers were decidedly invented by Joe Manton\". By the 1850s Hawker was again claiming the invention for himself in his press advertisements. \nDespite many years of research by Winant, Gooding and De Witt Bailey, the jury is still out as the competing claims are based on personal accounts and have little or no independently verifiable evidence. \nWhile the metal percussion cap was the most popular and widely used type of primer, their small size made them difficult to handle under the stress of combat or while riding a horse. Accordingly, several manufacturers developed alternative, \"auto-priming\" systems. The \"Maynard tape primer\", for example, used a roll of paper \"caps\" much like today's toy cap gun. The Maynard tape primer was fitted to some firearms used in the mid-nineteenth century and a few saw brief use in the American Civil War. Other disc or pellet-type primers held a supply of tiny fulminate detonator discs in a small magazine. Cocking the hammer automatically advanced a disc into position. However, these automatic feed systems were difficult to make with the manufacturing systems in the early and mid-nineteenth century and generated more problems than they solved. They were quickly shelved in favor of a single percussion cap that, while unwieldy in some conditions, could be carried in sufficient quantities to make up for occasionally dropping one, while a jammed tape primer system would instead reduce the rifle to an awkward club.\nMilitary firearms.\nThis invention was gradually improved, and came to be used, first in a steel cap and then in a copper cap, by various gunmakers and private individuals before coming into general military use nearly thirty years later. The alteration of the military flintlock to the percussion musket was easily accomplished by replacing the powder pan and steel frizzen with a nipple and by replacing the cock or hammer that held the flint by a smaller hammer formed with a hollow made to fit around the nipple when released by the trigger. On the nipple was placed the copper cap containing Shaw's detonating composition of three parts of chlorate of potash, two of fulminate of mercury and one of powdered glass. The hollow in the hammer contained the fragments of the cap if it fragmented, reducing the risk of injury to the firer's eyes. From the 1820s onwards, the armies of Britain, France, Russia, and America began converting their muskets to the new percussion system. Caplocks were generally applied to the British military musket (the Brown Bess) in 1842, a quarter of a century after the invention of percussion powder and after an elaborate government test at Woolwich in 1834. The first percussion firearm produced for the US military was the percussion carbine version (c.1833) of the M1819 Hall rifle. The Americans' breech loading caplock Hall rifles, muzzle loading rifled muskets and Colt Dragoon revolvers gave them an advantage over the smoothbore flintlock Brown Bess muskets used by Santa Anna's troops during the Mexican War. In Japan, matchlock pistols and muskets were converted to percussion from the 1850s onwards, and new guns based on existing designs were manufactured as caplocks.\nThe Austrians instead used a variant of Manton's tube lock in their Augustin musket until the conventional caplock Lorenz rifle was introduced in 1855. The first practical solution for the problem of handling percussion caps in battle was the Prussian 1841 (Dreyse needle gun), which used a long needle to penetrate a paper cartridge filled with black powder and strike the percussion cap that was fastened to the base of the bullet. While it had a number of problems, it was widely used by the Prussians and other German states in the mid-nineteenth century and was a major factor in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War. The needle gun originally fired paper cartridges containing a bullet, powder charge and percussion cap, but by the time of the Franco-Prussian War this had evolved into modern brass ammunition.\nLater firearms evolution.\nThe percussion cap brought about the invention of the modern cartridge case and made possible the general adoption of the breech-loading principle for all varieties of rifles, shotguns and pistols. After the American Civil War, Britain, France, and America began converting existing caplock guns to accept brass rimfire and centrefire cartridges. For muskets such as the 1853 Enfield and 1861 Springfield, this involved installing a firing pin in place of the nipple, and a trapdoor in the breech to accept the new bullets. Examples include the Trapdoor Springfield, Tabati\u00e8re rifle, Westley Richards and Snider\u2013Enfield conversions. The British Army used Snider Enfields contemporaneously with the Martini\u2013Henry rifle until the .303 bolt action Lee\u2013Metford repeating rifle was introduced in the 1880s. Later, military surplus Sniders were purchased as hunting and defensive weapons by British colonists and trusted local natives.\nCaplock revolvers such as the Colt Navy and Remington were also widely converted during the late 19th century, by replacing the existing cylinder with one designed for modern ammunition. These were used extensively by the Turks in the Russo-Turkish War, the US Cavalry during the Indian Wars, and also by gunfighters, lawmen, and outlaws in the old west.\nIn the 1840s and 1850s, the percussion cap was first integrated into a metallic cartridge, where the bullet is held in by the casing, the casing is filled with gunpowder, and a primer is placed on the end. By the 1860s and 1870s, breech-loading metallic cartridges had made the percussion cap system obsolete.\nToday, reproduction percussion firearms are popular for recreational shooters and percussion caps are still available (though some modern muzzleloaders use shotshell primers instead of caps). Most percussion caps now use non-corrosive compounds such as lead styphnate.\nOther uses.\nCaps are used in cartridges, grenades, rocket-propelled grenades and rescue flares. Percussion caps are also used in land mine fuzes, booby-trap firing devices and anti-handling devices. Most purpose-made military booby-trap firing devices contain some form of spring-loaded firing pin designed to strike a percussion cap connected to a detonator at one end. The detonator is inserted into an explosive charge\u2014e.g., C-4 or a block of TNT. Triggering the booby-trap (e.g., by pulling on a trip-wire) releases the cocked firing pin that flips forward to strike the percussion cap, firing it and the attached detonator; the shock-wave from the detonator sets off the main explosive charge.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is governed by different national bodies. There are two forms of the sport \u2013 flat racing and jump racing, the latter known as National Hunt racing in the UK and steeplechasing in the US. Jump racing can be further divided into hurdling and steeplechasing.\nAccording to \"The Guardian\", the racing of Thoroughbreds has been steadily declining in popularity worldwide. Between 700 and 800 racehorses die in racing each year. \nOwnership and training of racehorses.\nTraditionally, racehorses have been owned by wealthy individuals. It has become increasingly common in the last few decades for horses to be owned by syndicates or partnerships. Notable examples include the 2005 Epsom Derby winner Motivator, owned by the Royal Ascot Racing Club, 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide, owned by a group of 10 partners organized as Sackatoga Stable, and 2008 Kentucky Derby winner Big Brown, owned by IEAH stables, a horse racing hedgefund organization.\nHistorically, most race horses have been bred and raced by their owners. Beginning after World War II, the commercial breeding industry became significantly more important in North America, Europe and Australasia, the result of which being that a substantial portion of Thoroughbreds are now sold by their breeders, either at public auction or through private sales. Additionally, owners may acquire Thoroughbreds by \"claiming\" them out of a race (see discussion of types of races below).\nA horse runs in the unique colours of its owner. These colours must be registered under the national governing bodies and no two owners may have the same colours. The rights to certain colour arrangements (\"cherished colours\") are valuable in the same way that distinctive car registration numbers are of value. It is said that Sue Magnier (owner of George Washington, Galileo etc.) paid \u00a350,000 for her distinctive dark blue colours. If an owner has more than one horse running in the same race then some slight variant in colours is often used (normally a different coloured cap) or the race club colours may be used.\nThe horse owner typically pays a monthly retainer or, in North America, a \"day rate\" to his or her trainer, together with fees for use of the training center or gallops (if the horse is not stabled at a race track), veterinarian and farrier (horseshoer) fees and other expenses such as mortality insurance premiums, stakes entry fees and jockeys' fees. The typical cost of owning a race horse in training for one year is in the order of \u00a315,000 in the United Kingdom and as much as $35,000 at major race tracks in North America.\nThe facilities available to trainers vary enormously. Some trainers have only a few horses in the yard and pay to use other trainers' gallops. Other trainers have every conceivable training asset. It is a feature of racing that a modest establishment often holds its own against the bigger players even in a top race. This is particularly true of national hunt racing.\nValues.\nIn 1976, Canadian Bound became the first Thoroughbred yearling racehorse ever to be sold for more than US$1 million when he was purchased at the Keeneland July sale by Canadians, Ted Burnett and John Sikura Jr.\nOrganizations.\nJockey clubs.\nPer the \"Oxford English Dictionary\" the concept of a jockey club dates to at least 1775 and is, in the generic, a \"club or association for the promotion and regulation of horse racing.\" There are scores of national and regional jockey clubs, also called racing associations, worldwide. In addition to thoroughbreds, jockey clubs may race standardbred horses, Quarter Horses, or Arabians.\nIreland.\nRacing is governed on an All-Ireland basis, with two bodies sharing organising responsibility. The Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board is the rulemaking and enforcement body, whilst Horse Racing Ireland governs and promotes racing. In 2013, Ireland exported more than 4,800 Thoroughbreds to 37 countries worldwide with a total value in excess of \u20ac205 million ($278 million). This is double the number of horses exported annually from the U.S.\nGreat Britain.\nIn Great Britain, Thoroughbred horse racing is governed by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) which makes and enforces the rules, issues licences or permits to trainers and jockeys, and runs the races through their race course officials. The Jockey Club in the UK has been released from its regulatory function but still performs various supporting roles.\nA significant part of the BHA's work relates to the disciplining of trainers and jockeys, including appeals from decisions made by the course stewards. Disciplinary enquiries usually relate to the running of a horse, for example: failure to run a horse on its merits, interference with other runners, excessive use of the whip. The emergence of internet betting exchanges has created opportunities for the public to lay horses and this development has been associated with some high-profile disciplinary proceedings.\nIn order to run under rules a horse must be registered at Weatherbys as a Thoroughbred. It must also reside permanently at the yard of a trainer licensed by the BHA or a permit holder. Similarly the horse's owner or owners must be registered as owners.\nAustralia.\nThoroughbred racing is governed on a state-by-state basis in Australia. Racing NSW administers racing in New South Wales, Racing Victoria is the responsible entity in Victoria, the Brisbane Racing Club was an amalgamation in 2009 of the Queensland Turf Club and Brisbane Racing Club, and administers racing in Queensland.\nFlemington Racecourse in Melbourne is home to the Melbourne Cup, the richest \"two-mile\" handicap in the world, and one of the richest turf races. The race is held on the first Tuesday in November during the Spring Racing Carnival, and is publicised in Australia as \"the race that stops a nation\".\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, safety regulations and drug restrictions are primarily controlled at the federal level by the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority. Other aspects of racing regulation are highly fragmented. Generally, a racing commission or other state government entity in each U.S. state that conducts racing will license owners, trainers and others involved in the industry, set racing dates, and oversee wagering. Pedigree matters and the registration of racing colors are the province of the Jockey Club, which maintains the American Stud Book and approves the names of all Thoroughbreds.\nThe National Steeplechase Association is the official sanctioning body of American steeplechase horse racing.\nCanada.\nRegulation of horse racing in Canada is under the Jockey Club of Canada. There are a few racing venues across Canada, but the major events are mainly in Ontario and managed by the Woodbine Entertainment Group, formerly Ontario Jockey Club. While British Columbia's major venue is Hastings Racecourse with popular events like the annual BC Derby.\nTypes of racing.\nThoroughbred racing is divided into two codes: flat racing and jump races. The most significant races are categorised as Group races or Graded stakes races. Every governing body is free to set its own standards, so the quality of races may differ. Horses are also run under different conditions, for example Handicap races, Weight for Age races or Scale-Weight. Although handicapping is generally seen as serving the purpose of gambling rather than identifying the fastest horses, some of the best known races in the world, such as the Grand National or Melbourne Cup are run as handicaps.\nFlat racing.\nFlat races can be run under varying distances and on different terms. Historically, the major flat racing countries were Australia, England, Ireland, France and the United States, but other countries, such as Japan and the United Arab Emirates, have emerged in recent decades. Some countries and regions have a long tradition as major breeding centers, namely Ireland and Kentucky.\nIn Europe and Australia, virtually all major races are run on turf (grass) courses, while in the United States, dirt surfaces (or, lately, artificial surfaces such as Polytrack) are prevalent. In Canada, South America and Asia, both surface types are common.\nJump racing.\nJump races and steeplechases, called National Hunt racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland, are run over long distances, usually from up to , and horses carry more weight. Many jump racers, especially those bred in France, are not Thoroughbreds, being classified as AQPS. Novice jumping races involve horses that are starting out a jumping career, including horses that previously were trained in flat racing. National Hunt racing is distinguished between hurdles races and chases: the former are run over low obstacles and the latter over larger fences that are much more difficult to jump. National Hunt races are started by flag, which means that horses line up at the start behind a tape. Jump racing is popular in the UK, Ireland, France and parts of Central Europe, but only a minor sport or completely unknown in most other regions of the world. National Hunt flat races (or \"bumpers\") without fences or hurdles are also staged to provide experience for horses which have not taken part in flat racing.\nHorse breeding.\nIn the world's major Thoroughbred racing countries, breeding of racehorses is a huge industry providing over a million jobs worldwide. While the attention of horseracing fans and the media is focused almost exclusively on the horse's performance on the racetrack or for male horses, possibly its success as a sire, little publicity is given to the brood mares. Such is the case of La Troienne, one of the most important mares of the 20th century to whom many of the greatest Thoroughbred champions, and dams of champions can be traced.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is run at a distance of for a maximum of 17 three-year-old thoroughbred horses foaled in Canada.\nThe race is the first in the Canadian Triple Crown, typically taking place each summer at Woodbine Racetrack in Etobicoke, Ontario. The event was scheduled in June or July until 2020, when it was postponed to September, due to government-imposed restrictions in place through the COVID-19 pandemic. Since 2021, Woodbine ran the Queen's Plate, and now runs the King's Plate, in August.\nThe race's name reflects the title of the reigning Canadian monarch, following on Queen Victoria's donation of the first cup. The Woodbine Entertainment Group, which owns and operates the event, announced in December 2022 the race would be renamed the \"King's Plate\", following the accession of King Charles III on 8 September 2022.\nHistory.\nIn 1859, the then-President of the Toronto Turf Club, Sir Casimir Gzowski, petitioned Queen Victoria to grant a plate for a new race in the Canada West (today Ontario). With the monarch's approval, the first Queen's Plate was run on 27 June 1860, at the Carleton racetrack in Toronto, with the prize of \"a plate to the value of 50 guineas\". Despite the name, the winning owner is presented with a gold cup, rather than a plate.\nThe race was originally restricted to three-year-olds bred in Canada that had never won a stakes race and was run in heats, with a horse having to win two heats to be declared the winner. The race conditions have since evolved; heat racing was discontinued in 1879 and, around the same time, the race was opened to stakes winners (some early records are incomplete). For many years, the race was open to older horses and, in the early 1900s, was even open to two-year-olds. The King's Plate is currently restricted to three-year-olds foaled in Canada. The owner must pay a nomination fee ($500 in 2018) in February, a second subscription fee ($1,500 in 2018) in May, and a final entry fee ($10,000) prior to the race.\nThe first four renewals were run at Carleton racetrack. After that, the Queen's Plate became a \"movable feast\", with politicians from all over modern-day Ontario vying to host the race in their constituency. Fifteen different race tracks hosted the race over the next two decades, with distances varying from one to two miles. In 1883, the race moved to Old Woodbine, located in eastern Toronto along Lake Ontario. The race continued to be held at Old Woodbine until that track was replaced by \"New\" Woodbine in northern Toronto in 1956. The race has been run at Woodbine ever since. In 2006, Woodbine changed the track surface for the main track from natural dirt to a synthetic surface known as Polytrack. In 2016, the surface was changed to Tapeta. Because of the change in racing surfaces, Woodbine maintains several sets of track and stakes records. The fastest time for the race on the original dirt surface at the current distance is 2:01 4/5, set by Kinghaven Farms' Izvestia in 1990. The current stakes record (the fastest all-time) is 2:01.48, set by Moira in 2022 on Tapeta.\nIn 1902, the year after Victoria's death, the race became the King's Plate, after her successor, Edward VII. It became the Queen's Plate again during the reign of Elizabeth II (1952\u20132022). In 2022, it reverted to the King's Plate upon the accession of Charles III.\nHorses owned by Windfields Farm have won the Plate eleven times, but the most successful was the stable owned by Joseph E. Seagram, a prominent distiller from Waterloo, Ontario. Seagram's stable won the Plate on twenty occasions between 1891 and 1935 including eight times in a row between 1891 and 1898, and ten times in eleven years from 1891 to 1901.\nAt the 1925 King's Plate, W. A. Hewitt and his son Foster Hewitt called the first horse race broadcast on radio.\nIn 1964, Northern Dancer, the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby, also won the Queen's Plate in his final race.\nIn 2006, Josie Carroll became the first woman trainer to win the Queen's Plate. The following year, Emma-Jayne Wilson became the first female jockey to win the race.\nThe 2004-2013 Plate winners had little success in their subsequent racing careers. This compares unfavourably to the 1990s when a number of Plate winners had considerable success thereafter, including With Approval, Izvestia, Dance Smartly and Awesome Again. The more recent Queen's Plate winners have also been successful, including Lexie Lou (who became a multiple graded stakes winner in Canada and the US after winning the Plate in 2014) and Shaman Ghost (a Grade I winner in America after winning the Plate in 2015).\nNick Eaves, former President and CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group, announced during the 2012 Queen's Plate post position draw that Woodbine Racetrack might be forced to close in April 2013 due to the cancellation of Slots at Racetrack program partnerships between Ontario's racetracks and the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation. Eaves said that if Woodbine is not open, \"there won't be a Queen's Plate.\" A new funding agreement was put in place in March 2013, which ensured the continuation of horse racing at Woodbine.\n39 fillies have won the Plate, beginning with Brunette in 1864. The 2017 running was won by the filly Holy Helena, while the 2018 running was won by Wonder Gadot. Two chestnut fillies both by the name of Wild Rose have won the Queen's Plate, in 1867 and 1886. They were the daughter and great-great-granddaughter respectively of Yellow Rose, who also produced the first Queen's Plate winner Don Juan.\nThe latest filly to win the Queen's Plate was Caitlinhergrtness in 2024.\nThe race has been held at a variety of distances:\nTriple Crown dispute with Fort Erie Race Track.\nSince 2021, a year after the Queen's Plate was moved to September from its usual June or July spot due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Woodbine has run the race in August. As a result, Fort Erie Race Track, which runs the second of Canada's Triple Crown races, the Prince of Wales Stakes, moved their race to after the King's Plate. In April 2023, a few months after Woodbine announced that the 2023 King's Plate would again be run in August, Fort Erie filed a grievance with the Canadian Trade Commission over what it called business practices that were \"unfair and clearly predatory.\" A member of the Fort Erie Council suggested that the COVID pandemic was over and that the King's Plate should move back to June, adding that continuing to run the race in August would not be in Fort Erie Race Track's best economic interests, as it would result in the Prince of Wales Stakes being run after Labour Day, when the key summer tourism season is over. Woodbine responded that Fort Erie's allegations are \"baseless and without merit\" and that they would defend themselves if requested by the Trade Commission.\nRoyal patronage.\nAs King of Canada, Charles III is patron of the event. Various other members of the Canadian royal family have attended, beginning with John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, and his wife, Princess Louise, in 1881, when Lorne was serving as governor general of Canada and the couple was touring Ontario. Queen Elizabeth II's fourth and final visit to the race was in early July 2010.\nRecords.\nStakes Record\nWinningest Jockeys:\nWinningest Trainers:\nWinningest Owners:\nWinners.\n\u2020 indicates a filly\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He worked across a range of genres and had an aptitude for getting the best out of actors regardless of their experience. He is one of 21 people to have won all four of the major American entertainment awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (EGOT). His other honors included three BAFTA Awards, the Lincoln Center Gala Tribute in 1999, the National Medal of Arts in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2003 and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2010. His films received a total of 42 Academy Award nominations, and seven wins.\nNichols began his career in the 1950s with the comedy improvisational troupe The Compass Players, predecessor of The Second City, in Chicago. He then teamed up with his improv partner, Elaine May, to form the comedy duo Nichols and May. Their live improv act was a hit on Broadway, and each of their three albums was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album; their second album, \"An Evening with Mike Nichols and Elaine May\", won the award in 1962. After they disbanded, he began directing plays, and quickly became known for his innovative theatre productions.\nHis Broadway directing debut was Neil Simon's \"Barefoot in the Park\" in 1963, with Robert Redford and Elizabeth Ashley. He continued to direct plays on Broadway, including \"Luv\" (1964), and \"The Odd Couple\" (1965) for each of which he received Tony Awards. He won his sixth Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play with a revival of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\" (2012) starring Philip Seymour Hoffman. His final directing credit was the revival of Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal\" (2013). Nichols directed and/or produced more than 25 Broadway plays throughout his prolific career.\nWarner Bros. invited Nichols to direct his first film, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), followed by \"The Graduate\" (1967) for which Nichols won the Academy Award for Best Director. Nichols also directed \"Catch-22\" (1970), \"Carnal Knowledge\" (1971), \"The Day of the Dolphin\" (1973), \"Silkwood\" (1983), \"Working Girl\" (1988), \"Postcards from the Edge\" (1990), \"Wolf\" (1994), \"The Birdcage\" (1996), \"Primary Colors\" (1998), \"Closer\" (2004), and \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007). Nichols additionally directed the HBO television film \"Wit\" (2001), and miniseries \"Angels in America\" (2003), both of which won him the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie.\nEarly life.\nNichols was born Igor Mikhail Peschkowsky on November 6, 1931, in Berlin, Germany. He was a son of Brigitte Claudia (n\u00e9e Landauer) and Pavel Peschkowsky, a physician. His father was born in Vienna, Austria, to a Russian-Jewish immigrant family. Nichols's father's family had been wealthy and lived in Siberia, leaving after the Russian Revolution, and settling in Germany around 1920. Nichols's mother's family were German Jews. His maternal grandparents were Gustav Landauer, a leading theorist on anarchism, and author Hedwig Lachmann.\nAround age four, Nichols had lost his hair following an allergic reaction to an inoculation for whooping cough; consequently, when he reached adulthood he wore wigs and false eyebrows for the rest of his life.\nIn April 1939, when the Nazis were arresting Jews in Berlin, seven-year-old Mikhail and his three-year-old brother Robert were sent alone to the United States to join their father, who had fled months earlier. His mother joined the family by escaping through Italy in 1940. The family moved to New York City on April 28, 1939. His father, whose original name was Pavel Nikolaevich Peschkowsky, changed his name to Paul Nichols, Nichols derived from his Russian patronymic. Before Paul Nichols had received his U.S. medical license, he was employed by a union on 42nd Street, X-raying union members. He later had a successful medical practice in Manhattan, enabling the family to live near Central Park.\nBefore he established his practice, he was a union doctor, and part of his job was X-raying union members. They didn't know about shielding X-ray machines, and he died of leukemia at 44. [in 1944]\n\u2013 Mike Nichols\nIn 1944, Mike Nichols became a naturalized citizen of the United States and attended public elementary school in Manhattan (). After graduating from the Walden School, a private progressive school on Central Park West, Nichols briefly attended New York University before dropping out. In 1950, he enrolled in the pre-med program at the University of Chicago. He later described this college period as \"paradise\", recalling how \"I never had a friend from the time I came to this country until I got to the University of Chicago.\"\nWhile in Chicago in 1953, Nichols joined the staff of struggling classical music station WFMT, 98.7 FM, as an announcer. Co-owner Rita Jacobs asked Nichols to create a folk music program on Saturday nights, which he named \"The Midnight Special\". He hosted the program for two years before leaving for New York City. Nichols frequently invited musicians to perform live in the studio and eventually created a unique blend of \"folk music and farce, showtunes and satire, odds and ends\", along with his successor Norm Pellegrini. The program celebrated its 70th anniversary in the same time slot in 2023.\nComedy career.\nNichols first saw Elaine May when she was sitting in the front row while he was playing the lead in a Chicago production of \"Miss Julie,\" and they made eye contact. Weeks later he ran into her in a train station where he started a conversation in an assumed accent, pretending to be a spy, and she played along, using another accent. They hit it off immediately, which led to a brief romance. Later in his career, he said \"Elaine was very important to me from the moment I saw her.\"\nIn 1953, Nichols left Chicago for New York City to study method acting under Lee Strasberg, but was unable to find stage work there. He was invited back to join Chicago's Compass Players in 1955, the predecessor to Chicago's Second City, whose members included May, Shelley Berman, Del Close, and Nancy Ponder, directed by Paul Sills. In Chicago, he started doing improvisational routines with May, which eventually led to the formation of the comedy duo Nichols and May in 1958, first performing in New York City.\nThey performed live satirical comedy acts and eventually released three records of their routines, which became best-sellers. They also appeared in nightclubs and were on radio and television. Jack Rollins, who later became Woody Allen's manager and producer, invited them to audition and was most impressed: \"Their work was so startling, so new, as fresh as could be. I was stunned by how really good they were, actually as impressed by their acting technique as by their comedy ... I thought, My God, these are two people writing hilarious comedy on their feet!\"\nIn 1960, Nichols and May opened the Broadway show \"An Evening With Mike Nichols and Elaine May\", directed by Arthur Penn. The LP album of the show won the 1962 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. Personal idiosyncrasies and tensions, such as on the unsuccessful \"A Matter of Position\", a play written by May and starring Nichols, eventually drove the duo apart to pursue other projects in 1961. About their sudden breakup, director Arthur Penn said, \"They set the standard and then they had to move on,\" while talk show host Dick Cavett said \"they were one of the comic meteors in the sky.\" Comedy historian Gerald Nachman describes the effect of their break-up on American comedy:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThey later reconciled and worked together many times. They appeared together at President Jimmy Carter's inaugural gala, in 1977, and in a 1980 New Haven stage revival of \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" with Swoosie Kurtz and James Naughton. May scripted Nichols's films \"The Birdcage\" (1996) and \"Primary Colors\" (1998). In 2010, at the AFI's \"Life Achievement Award\" ceremony, May gave a humor-filled tribute to Nichols.\nCareer as a director.\n1960\u20131970: Broadway debut and film breakthrough.\nPre-film stage career\nAfter the professional split with May, Nichols went to Vancouver, British Columbia, to work in the theater, directing a production of Oscar Wilde's \"The Importance of Being Earnest\" and acting in a revival of George Bernard Shaw's \"St. Joan\". In 1963, Nichols was chosen to direct Neil Simon's play \"Barefoot in the Park\". He realized at once that he was meant to be a director, saying in a 2003 interview: \"On the first day of rehearsal, I thought, 'Well, look at this. Here is what I was meant to do.' I knew instantly that I was home\". \"Barefoot in the Park\" was a big hit, running for 1,530 performances and earning Nichols a Tony Award for his direction.\nThis began a series of highly successful plays on Broadway (often from works by Simon) that would establish his reputation. After directing an off-Broadway production of Ann Jellicoe's \"The Knack\", Nichols directed Murray Schisgal's play \"Luv\" in 1964. Again the show was a hit and Nichols won a Tony Award (shared with \"The Odd Couple\"). In 1965 he directed another play by Neil Simon, \"The Odd Couple\". The original production starred Art Carney as Felix Ungar and Walter Matthau as Oscar Madison. The play ran for 966 performances and won Tony Awards for Nichols, Simon and Matthau. Overall, Nichols won nine Tony Awards, including six for Best Director of either a play or a musical, one for Best Play, and one for Best Musical.\nWho's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\nIn 1966, Nichols was a star stage director and \"Time\" magazine called him \"the most in-demand director in the American theatre.\" Although he had no experience in filmmaking, after he befriended Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Warner Bros. invited Nichols to direct a screen adaptation of Edward Albee's \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", starring Taylor, Burton, George Segal, and Sandy Dennis, for which he received a fee of $400,000. The film was critically acclaimed, with critics calling Nichols \"the new Orson Welles\", and a financial success, the number 1 film of 1966.\nThe film was considered groundbreaking for having a level of profanity and sexual innuendo unheard of at that time. It won five Academy Awards and garnered thirteen nominations (including Nichols's first nomination for Best Director), earning the distinctions of being one of only two films nominated in every eligible category at the Oscars (the other being \"Cimarron\"), and the first film to have its entire credited cast nominated for acting Oscars. It also won three BAFTA Awards and was later ranked No. 67 in \"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)\".\nThe Graduate\nHis next film was \"The Graduate\" (1967), starring Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft and Katharine Ross for which he was paid $150,000, a deal he had made four years earlier with producer Joseph E. Levine. It became the highest-grossing film of 1967 and one of the highest-grossing films in history up to that date, with Nichols receiving &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;16+2\u20443% of the profits, making him a millionaire. It was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with Nichols winning as Best Director. In 2007, it was ranked #17 in \"AFI's 100 Years ... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)\".\nHowever, getting the film made was difficult for Nichols, who, while noted for being a successful Broadway director, was still an unknown in Hollywood. Producer Lawrence Turman, who wanted only Nichols to direct it, was continually turned down for financing. He then contacted Levine, who said he would finance the film because he had associated with Nichols on \"The Knack\", and because he heard that Elizabeth Taylor specifically wanted Nichols to direct her and Richard Burton in \"Virginia Woolf\". With financing assured, Nichols suggested Buck Henry for screenwriter, although Henry's experience had also been mostly in improvised comedy, and had no writing background. Nichols said to Henry, \"I think you could do it; I think you \"should\" do it.\"\nNichols also took a chance on using Dustin Hoffman, who had no film experience, for the lead, when others had suggested using known star Robert Redford. Hoffman credits Nichols for having taken a great risk in giving him, a relative unknown, the starring role: \"I don't know of another instance of a director at the height of his powers who would take a chance and cast someone like me in that part. It took tremendous courage.\" The quality of the cinematography was also influenced by Nichols, who chose Oscar winner Robert Surtees to do the photography. Surtees, who had photographed major films since the 1920s, including \"Ben-Hur\", said later, \"It took everything I had learned over 30 years to be able to do the job. I knew that Mike Nichols was a young director who went in for a lot of camera. We did more things in this picture than I ever did in one film.\"\nNichols also chose the music by Simon and Garfunkel. When Paul Simon was taking too long to write new songs for the film, he used existing songs, originally planning to replace them with newly written ones. In the end only one new song was available, and Nichols used the existing previously released songs. At one point, when Nichols heard Paul Simon's song, \"Mrs. Roosevelt\", he suggested to Simon that he change it to \"Mrs. Robinson\". The song won a Grammy after the film was released and became America's number 1 pop song. Nichols selected all the numerous songs for the film and chose which scenes they would be used in. The placement and selection of songs would affect the way audiences understood the film. Even actor William Daniels, who played Hoffman's father, remembers that after first hearing the songs, especially \"The Sound of Silence\", he thought, \"Oh, wait a minute. That changed the whole idea of the picture for me,\" suddenly realizing the film would not be a typical comedy.\nNichols had previously returned to Broadway to direct \"The Apple Tree\", starring Second City alumna, Barbara Harris. After doing \"The Graduate\", he again returned to the Broadway stage with a revival of Lillian Hellman's \"The Little Foxes\" in 1967, which ran for 100 performances. He then directed Neil Simon's \"Plaza Suite\" in 1968, earning him another Tony Award for Best Director. He also directed the short film \"Teach Me!\" (1968), which starred actress Sandy Dennis. In 1969 his film production company, Friwaftt, was acquired by Avco Embassy, the distributor of \"The Graduate\", who also appointed him to the board of directors. Friwaftt stood for \"Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.\"\nNichols's next film was a big-budget adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel \"Catch-22\" (1970), followed by \"Carnal Knowledge\" (1971) starring Jack Nicholson, Ann-Margret, Art Garfunkel and Candice Bergen. \"Carnal Knowledge\" was highly controversial upon release because of the casual and blunt depiction of sexual intercourse. In Georgia, a theatre manager was convicted in 1972 of violating the state's obscenity statutes by showing the film, a conviction later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in \"Jenkins v. Georgia\".\n1971\u20131989: Rise to prominence and stardom.\nNichols returned to Broadway to direct Neil Simon's \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" in 1971. The play won Nichols another Tony Award for Best Director. In 1973, Nichols directed a revival of Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya\" on Broadway starring George C. Scott and with a new translation by himself and Albert Todd. In 1973 Nichols directed the film \"The Day of the Dolphin\" starring George C. Scott, based on the French novel \"Un animal dou\u00e9 de raison\" (lit. \"A Sentient Animal\") by Robert Merle and adapted by Buck Henry. The film was not successful financially and received mixed reviews from critics. Nichols next directed \"The Fortune\" (1975), starring Warren Beatty, Jack Nicholson and Stockard Channing. Again, the film was a financial failure and received mostly negative reviews. In 1975, Nichols began filming \"Bogart Slept Here\", an original screenplay by Neil Simon. The film starred Robert De Niro and Simon's wife, Marsha Mason. After one week of filming, displeased with the results, Nichols and the studio fired De Niro and shut the production down. Simon would retool the script two years later as \"The Goodbye Girl\". Nichols would not direct another narrative feature film for eight years.\nNichols returned to the stage with two moderately successful productions in 1976; David Rabe's \"Streamers\" opened in April and ran for 478 performances. Trevor Griffiths's \"Comedians\" ran for 145 performances. In 1976 Nichols also worked as Executive Producer to create the television drama \"Family\" for ABC. The series ran until 1980. In 1977, Nichols produced the original Broadway production of the hugely successful musical \"Annie\", which ran for 2,377 performances until 1983. Nichols won the Tony Award for Best Musical. Later in 1977, Nichols directed D.L. Coburn's \"The Gin Game\". The play ran for 517 performances and won a Tony Award for Best Actress for Jessica Tandy.\nIn 1980, Nichols directed the documentary \"Gilda Live\", a filmed performance of comedian Gilda Radner's one-woman show \"Gilda Radner Live on Broadway\". It was released at the same time as the album of the show, both of which were successful. Nichols was then involved with two unsuccessful shows: he produced \"Billy Bishop Goes to War\", which opened in 1980 and closed after only twelve performances, and directed Neil Simon's \"Fools\", in 1981, which closed after forty performances. Returning to Hollywood, Nichols's career rebounded in 1983 with the film \"Silkwood\", starring Meryl Streep, Cher and Kurt Russell, based on the life of whistleblower Karen Silkwood. The film was a financial and critical success, with film critic Vincent Canby calling it \"the most serious work Mike Nichols has yet done.\" The film received five Academy Award nominations, including a Best Director nomination for Nichols.\nThat same year, Nichols and Peter Stone helped to fix up and rewrite the musical \"My One and Only\" just days before its Boston premiere. The show eventually went to Broadway and ran for 767 performances, winning Tony Awards for Best Actor, Best Choreography (both for Tommy Tune) and Best Supporting Actor (Charles \"Honi\" Coles). In 1984, Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Tom Stoppard's \"The Real Thing\". \"The New York Times\" critic Frank Rich wrote that \"The Broadway version of \"The Real Thing\"\u2014a substantial revision of the original London production\u2014is not only Mr. Stoppard's most moving play, but also the most bracing play that anyone has written about love and marriage in years.\" The play was nominated for seven Tony Awards and won five, including a Best Director Tony for Nichols. Nichols followed the success with the Broadway premiere of David Rabe's \"Hurlyburly\", also in 1984. It was performed just two blocks away from the theater showing \"The Real Thing\". It was nominated for three Tony Awards and won Best Actress for Judith Ivey.\nIn 1983, Nichols had seen comedian Whoopi Goldberg's one woman show, \"The Spook Show\", at Dance Theater Workshop and wanted to help her expand it. Goldberg's self-titled Broadway show opened in October 1984 and ran for 156 performances. Rosie O'Donnell later said that Nichols had discovered Goldberg while she was struggling as a downtown artist: \"He gave her the entire beginning of her career and recognized her brilliance before anyone else.\" In 1986 Nichols directed the Broadway premiere of Andrew Bergman's \"Social Security\" and in 1988 directed \"Waiting for Godot\", starring Robin Williams and Steve Martin. Williams cited Nichols and May as among his early influences for performing intelligent comedy.\nIn 1986, Nichols directed the film \"Heartburn\", which received mixed reviews, and starred Meryl Streep and Jack Nicholson. In 1988, Nichols completed two feature films. The first was an adaptation of Neil Simon's autobiographical stage play \"Biloxi Blues\" starring Matthew Broderick, also receiving mixed critical reviews. Nichols directed one of his most successful films, \"Working Girl\", which starred Melanie Griffith, Harrison Ford and Sigourney Weaver. The film was a huge hit upon its release, and received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Director for Nichols) and won the Academy Award for Best Song for Carly Simon's \"Let the River Run\". At one point in the 1980s, Nichols\u2014prone to bouts of depression\u2014reported that he had considered suicide, a feeling apparently brought on by a psychotic episode he experienced after taking the drug Halcion.\n1990\u20131999: Established career.\nIn the 1990s, Nichols directed several more successful, well-received films including \"Postcards from the Edge\" (1990) starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine; \"Primary Colors\" (1998) starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson; and \"The Birdcage\" (1996), an American remake of the 1978 French film \"La Cage aux Folles\" starring Robin Williams, Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest. Both \"The Birdcage\" and \"Primary Colors\" were written by Elaine May, Nichols's comedy partner earlier in his career. Other films directed by Nichols include \"Regarding Henry\" (1991) starring Harrison Ford and \"Wolf\" (1994) starring Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. When he was honored by Lincoln Center in 1999 for his life's work, Elaine May\u2014speaking once again as his friend\u2014served up the essence of Nichols with the following:\nSo he's witty, he's brilliant, he's articulate, he's on time, he's prepared and he writes. But is he perfect? He knows you can't really be liked or loved if you're perfect. You have to have just enough flaws. And he does. Just the right, perfect flaws to be absolutely endearing.\n2000\u20132016: Career expansion and later work.\nIn the 2000s, Nichols directed the films \"What Planet Are You From?\" (2000), \"Closer\" (2004) and \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007), a political drama that was ultimately his final feature film. \"What Planet Are You From?\" received mixed reviews from critics, while \"Closer\" and \"Charlie Wilson's War\" received generally positive reviews and were both nominated for Academy Awards, BAFTA and Golden Globe awards.\nNichols also directed widely acclaimed adaptations of \"Wit\" (2001) and \"Angels in America\" (2003) for television, winning Emmy Awards for both of them. For his direction of the Broadway musical \"Spamalot\", he won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical in 2005.\nIn 2012, Nichols won the Best Direction of a Play Tony Award for a revival of Arthur Miller's \"Death of a Salesman\". In 2013, he directed Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in a Broadway revival of Harold Pinter's \"Betrayal\". The play began previews of its limited run on October 1, 2013 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, opened on October 27, and closed on January 4, 2014.\nAmong projects that remained uncompleted when he died, in April 2013 it was announced that Nichols was in talks to direct a film adaptation of Jonathan Tropper's novel \"One Last Thing Before I Go\". The film was to be produced by J. J. Abrams, who previously wrote the Nichols-directed film \"Regarding Henry\" (1991). In July 2014, it was announced that Nichols and Streep would reunite for an HBO film of Terrence McNally's 1985 play \"Master Class\", with Nichols directing Streep in the starring role of opera singer Maria Callas.\nNichols was a contributing blogger at \"The Huffington Post\". He was also a co-founder of The New Actors Workshop in New York City, where he occasionally taught. In addition, he remained active in the Directors Guild of America, interviewing fellow film director Bennett Miller on stage in October 2011 after the Guild's screening of Miller's \"Moneyball\".\nIn January 2016, PBS aired \"\", an \"American Masters\" documentary about Nichols directed by his former improv partner, Elaine May. On February 22, 2016, HBO aired the documentary \"Becoming Mike Nichols\".\nDirecting style.\nAfter his early successes as a stage and film director, Nichols had developed a reputation as an auteur who likes to work intimately with his actors and writers, often using them repeatedly in different films. Writer Peter Applebome noted that \"few directors have such a gift for getting performances out of actors.\" During a half-year period in 1967 he had four hit plays running simultaneously on Broadway, during which time his first Hollywood feature, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", had also become a popular and critical success. Combined with his second film, \"The Graduate\", in 1967, the two films had already earned a total of 20 Oscar nominations, including two for Best Director, and winning it for \"The Graduate.\"\nNichols was able to get the best out of actors regardless of their acting experience, whether an unknown such as Dustin Hoffman or a major star like Richard Burton. For his first film, \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\", each of the four actors was nominated for an Oscar, with Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis winning. Burton later said, \"I didn't think I could learn anything about comedy\u2014I'd done all of Shakespeare's. But from him I learned,\" adding, \"He conspires with you to get your best.\"\nHowever, it was Taylor who chose Nichols to be their director, because, writes biographer David Bret, \"she particularly admired him because he had done a number of ad-hoc jobs to pay for his education after arriving in America as a seven-year-old Jewish refugee.\" Producer Ernest Lehman agreed with her choice: \"He was the only one who could handle them,\" he said. \"The Burtons were quite intimidating, and we needed a genius like Mike Nichols to combat them.\" Biographer Kitty Kelley says that neither Taylor nor Burton would ever again reach the heights of acting performance they did in that film.\nThe same style of directing was used for \"The Graduate\", where, notes film historian Peter Biskind, Nichols took Dustin Hoffman, with no movie acting experience, along with Anne Bancroft, Katharine Ross and others, and managed to get some of their finest acting on screen. This ability to work closely with actors would remain consistent throughout his career. Hoffman credits Nichols for permitting the realistic acting needed for the satirical roles in that film:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It's Nichols's style\u2014he walks that edge of really going as far as he can without falling over the cliff, into disbelief. It's not caricature. That's the highest compliment for satire.\nIn a similar way, Jeremy Irons, who acted in the play \"The Real Thing\", said that Nichols creates a very \"protective environment: he makes you feel he's only there for you,\" while Ann-Margret, for her role in \"Carnal Knowledge\", felt the same: \"What's wonderful about Mike is that he makes you feel like you're the one that's come up with the idea, when it's actually his.\"\nPersonal life.\nNichols was married four times; the first three ended in divorce, the last upon his death.\nNichols's first marriage was to Patricia Scot; they were married from 1957 to 1960. His second was to Margot Callas, a former \"muse\" of the poet Robert Graves, from 1963 to 1974. The couple had a daughter together, Daisy Nichols. His third marriage, in 1975, to Annabel Davis-Goff, produced two children, Max Nichols and Jenny Nichols; it ended in divorce in 1986. His fourth was to former \"Good Morning America\" and \"ABC World News\" anchor Diane Sawyer, whom he married on April 29, 1988. None of his wives were Jewish and his children were not brought up according to a religion, but they identify as Jewish. His son Max married former ESPN journalist Rachel Nichols.\nNichols had a lifelong interest in Arabian horses. From 1968 to 2004, he owned a farm in Connecticut and was a noted horse breeder. He also imported quality Arabian horses from Jan\u00f3w Podlaski Stud Farm in Poland, some of which sold for record-setting prices. While in high school, Nichols had been an instructor at the Claremont Riding Academy in Manhattan's Upper West Side and also had \"ridden in horse shows in Chicago.\"\nIn 2009, Nichols signed a petition in support of releasing director Roman Polanski, who had been detained while traveling to a film festival in relation to his 1977 sexual abuse charges, which the petition argued would undermine the tradition of film festivals as a place for works to be shown \"freely and safely\", and that arresting filmmakers traveling to neutral countries could open the door \"for actions of which no-one can know the effects.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nNichols died of a heart attack on November 19, 2014, at his apartment in Manhattan. During the 87th annual Academy Awards on 22 February 2015, Nichols was featured in the \"In Memoriam\" segment, in anchor position. Nichols left John Frederick Herring Sr.'s painting \"Horse with Groom\" to his son Max.\nWhen Nichols died, many celebrities paid tribute to him, including Whoopi Goldberg, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey and Tom Stoppard. On November 8, 2015, stars and artists gathered at New York's IAC Building to pay tribute to Nichols. Hosts for the private event included Elaine May and Lorne Michaels. Eric Idle and John Cleese performed. Guests included Streep, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Natalie Portman, Carly Simon, Nathan Lane and Christine Baranski.\nIn 2017, during an Oscars Actress Roundtable with \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Amy Adams, Natalie Portman, and Annette Bening spoke about the effect Nichols had on their lives. In 2020 Woody Allen described Nichols as \"maybe the best comedy director ever on the stage.\"\nAwards and honors.\nNichols is one of the few entertainers to have won the EGOT, the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony.\nNichols received five Academy Award nominations, winning Best Director for \"The Graduate\" (1967). He was also nominated for his work on \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" (1966), \"Silkwood\" (1983), \"Working Girl\" (1988) and for producing \"The Remains of the Day\" (1993). For his collaborations with Elaine May, Nichols was nominated for three Grammy Awards winning for Best Comedy Album in 1962. Nichols also known for his extensive work on Broadway and received 16 Tony Award nominations, winning eight times for \"Barefoot in the Park\" (1964), \"Luv\"/\"The Odd Couple\" (1965), \"Plaza Suite\" (1968), \"The Prisoner of Second Avenue\" (1972), \"Annie\" (1977), \"The Real Thing\" (1984), \"Monty Python's Spamalot\" (2005), and \"Death of a Salesman\" (2012). Nichols also received Primetime Emmy Awards for directing and producing the HBO television film \"Wit\" (2001) and miniseries \"Angels in America\" (2003).\nIn 1989 Nichols was presented the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement by Awards Council member Diane Sawyer. He also received a Gala tribute from Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1999. In 2001, he received the Peabody Award for his HBO television film \"Wit\" which starred Emma Thompson. In 2003 he was awarded with the Kennedy Center Honors where he was honored by Elaine May, Meryl Streep, Candice Bergen, and Tom Stoppard. In 2010 he was honored with the American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement Award where he was honored by Elaine May, Nora Ephron, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, Julia Roberts, Candice Bergen, Jack Nicholson, Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Harrison Ford, and Shirley MacLaine.\nDirection for Oscar-related performances.\nNichols has directed multiple Oscar winning and nominated performances.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It was promoted by a paper in the controversial and non-peer reviewed journal \"Medical Hypotheses\". It is not an evidence-based cancer treatment, and the costs of IPT are not covered by health insurance.\nAccording to Quackwatch, \"Insulin Potentiation Therapy (IPT) is one of several unproven, dangerous treatments that is promoted by a small group of practitioners without trustworthy evidence that it works.\"\nHistory.\nIt was developed by Donato Perez Garcia, MD in 1930. Originally, Garcia targeted syphilis, and later tried the treatment for chronic degenerative diseases and some types of cancer.\nMethod.\nGenerally, a dose of insulin is injected into a vein, followed by a much lower dose of a chemotherapy drug. Then sugar water is injected to stop the hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) caused by the insulin injection.\nEfficacy.\nIPT has not been proven to work. Lab research indicates that there is not even a theoretical possibility of it being an effective treatment for most cancers. Research over the decades has proved that most cancers grow when exposed to more insulin.\nOne study of men with prostate cancer showed that survival was significantly shorter (11 months for men who received IPT vs 18.9 months for men on standard treatment). A second small trial showed that women with metastatic breast cancer were less likely to see short-term disease progression if they received IPT with low-dose methotrexate than if they received either insulin alone or low-dose methotrexate alone. (This study did not compare IPT against any of the proven multi-drug chemotherapy regimens.)\nAdverse effects.\nThe immediate risk is hypoglycemia. The main risk is that the person will die from cancer because IPT does not work.\nThe use of lower than normal doses of chemotherapy can cause drug resistance, which could make future treatment at standard, proven doses ineffective. For some cancers, especially breast and colon cancers, insulin may promote tumor growth.\nMechanism of action.\nTwo main ideas about how it might work have been proposed over the years. The first idea, which has been proven wrong, is that insulin makes cells more permeable, so that the chemotherapy drugs are absorbed faster into cells. The other idea is that insulin might cause the cells to start dividing, which makes them more susceptible to destruction of many cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs.\nCost.\nCosts run up to US$2,000 per treatment session. Multiple sessions are normal. One business charges US$50,000 for the first two months. Patients pay the full cost out of pocket, because it is an unproven therapy that is not covered by health insurance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "67756", "revid": "440630", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67756", "title": "Emmett Kelly", "text": "American clown (1898\u20131979)\nEmmett Leo Kelly (December 9, 1898\u00a0\u2013 March 28, 1979) was an American circus performer who created the clown character \"Weary Willie\", based on the hobos of the Great Depression in the 1930s.\nEarly life.\nEmmett Leo Kelly was born in Sedan, Kansas, on December 9, 1898. His father, Thomas, was a section foreman for the Missouri Pacific Railroad. While he was still a child, the family moved to Southern Missouri where his father had purchased a farm in Texas County, near the community of Houston, Missouri. In the summer of 1909, he attended both the Mighty Haag and M.L. Clark and Son's circuses.\nAs a youth, he was enrolled by his mother, Mollie, in the Landon School of Cartooning, a correspondence school where he began developing his artistic skill.\nIn 1917, Kelly moved to Kansas City, hoping to get a job as a newspaper cartoonist. It was there that he created a cartoon of a tramp that he originally named \"Old Dubey\". While in Kansas City, Kelly began working for carnivals and circuses and trained as a trapeze artist.\nIn August 1920, Kelly returned to his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri where he appeared as a \"cartoonist and comedy specialist\" at the town's annual \"Old Settlers Reunion\".\nEarly circus career.\nKelly's first professional appearance as a clown was with Howe's Great London Circus on July 14, 1921, in Mason City, Iowa. Although he originally performed as a white-face clown, it was during that tour that he first appeared as a hobo character. After only a few performances as a tramp, Kelly returned to more traditional makeup, but not before a photograph was made of the character which would later be identified as \"Weary Willie.\" The photo appeared in the Howe's Great London Route Book of 1921 above a caption that read: \"Emmett Kelly, The Novelty Clown, Cartoonist, Tramp\".\nAt the end of the 1921 tour, the Howe's Great London Circus and Van Amburgh's Trained Wild Animal Show was acquired by the American Circus Corporation. In 1922 Kelly was assigned to perform his single trapeze act in the corporation's John Robinson Circus.\nKelly returned to John Robinson in 1923 and was part of a program that included eight members of the Moore family. The large troupe appeared in several displays including a double trapeze act featuring sisters Mitzi and Eva. Kelly married Eva in Charlottesville, Virginia, on July 21, 1923, and the pair began performing together on the trapeze.\nThe couple returned to the show in 1924, and as the season progressed, Emmett and Eva learned that they were expecting a child. On November 24, the last day of the John Robinson season, Emmett Kelly Jr. was born in Dyersburg, Tennessee.\nOn September 12, 1929, John Ringling purchased the American Circus Corporation. Included in the deal was the John Robinson show, along with the Al G. Barnes, Sparks, Sells-Floto and Hagenbeck-Wallace circuses.\nAs the economy suffered in 1930, disposable income dried up, and for many, circus tickets became a luxury. The John Robinson Circus, the oldest in the United States, was among the first to close, giving its final performance on September 5 at the Nebraska State Fair in Lincoln.\nAlthough fewer shows toured in 1931, The Aerial Kellys were among several acts that moved from John Robinson to the Ringling-owned Sells-Floto circus. Despite the fact that cowboy movie star Tom Mix was heavily promoted as a feature, Sells-Floto struggled. While the Kellys still considered themselves trapeze performers, Emmett was hired as a white-face clown with the Ringling-owned Hagenbeck-Wallace circus in 1932.\nA year later, the hobo character that had first been created on a drawing board in Kansas City came to life. Ragged homeless men were commonplace during the Depression, and on April 21, 1933, the tramp clown made his first appearance during a performance at the Chicago Coliseum.\nIn early 1934 a second child, Patrick, was born. At the end of the year, Hagenbeck-Wallace manager Jess Adkins, along with former Sells-Floto manager Zack Terrell, partnered to start their own show, the Cole Bros. and Clyde Beatty Combined Circus. Kelly was among those who made the jump from Hagenbeck-Wallace, although his wife Eva was not given a contract. Shortly after the season started, she asked for a divorce. Kelly later wrote that the sadness he experienced at the time worked its way into the character's persona.\nIn 1937, newspaper writer Hype Igho described the sad clown as \"Weary Willie.\" Igho had written about the act by using a term that originated decades earlier as a generic description for a nameless hobo. Kelly later said that Igho encouraged him to use the name and overnight, the character that had once referred to as Old Dubey became Weary Willie.\nDuring the winter of 1937\u201338, Kelly was hired to perform with the Bertram Mills Circus at the Olympia in London. It was at his European debut that he put his own spin on a routine that a veteran clown named Charlie \"Shorty\" Flem had performed years earlier at Madison Square Garden.\nThe act, which would become Kelly's signature routine, began with him sweeping the ring. A spotlight followed him, and as it danced about, he slapped, swept, and chased the pool of light with his broom. Once he completed the spotlight routine, Willie blew up a balloon until it popped, and then pantomiming his sorrow, he buried the remains in the sawdust.\nBroadway and Hollywood.\nWhen World War II broke out in September 1939, Kelly returned to the United States where he was cast in a new Broadway musical starring Jimmy Durante and Ray Bolger. The show, titled \"Keep Off the Grass\", was set in New York's Central Park, where Weary Willie appeared as one of several tramps, including an up-and-comer named Jackie Gleason, who was also making his Broadway debut.\nDespite the star power of Durante and Bolger, \"Keep Off the Grass\" did not receive good notices. The only positive review came from the \"Time\" critic who wrote: \"...and there's a bum, Emmett Kelly, who would leisurely proceed to eat a ham sandwich out of a paper poke while a bunch of other bums sang a park bench song; then he would lazily brush his teeth with the dry stub of a toothbrush, which provides the one moment of an otherwise uninspired show.\"\n\"Keep off the Grass\" closed after only 44 performances, and Kelly returned to the nightclub circuit as a cartoonist dressed as a tramp. Even though he would appear in rooms that were often noisy, Willie never uttered a word, but, as one newspaper noted, \"with lightning speed he would knock out about eight cartoons in less time than you can write your name.\"\nRingling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey.\nFor a year and a half Emmett made his living performing in nightclubs and indoor circuses until early 1941, when he received offers from both Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey and Cole Bros. After considering both opportunities, Kelly opted to go with Cole Bros., which promised a higher salary.\nIn the five years since Kelly had appeared under canvas in the United States, he honed his craft and matured as a performer to the point that the Cole Bros. publicity department touted him as \"the world's funniest clown.\" The stories that were placed in newspapers in advance of the circus described, and occasionally embellished, details associated with his tour of the United Kingdom.\nThe positive reviews caught the attention of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey, and in 1942 he joined the circus for the first of fourteen seasons with the show. In 1944, the character that Kelly had created was cast as the star in the featured spectacle. \"Panto's Paradise\" was staged as a \"dream of a hobo in fairyland.\"\nHartford circus fire.\nAlthough \"Panto's Paradise\" was Willie's big number in 1944, his first appearance occurred earlier in the program when the Wallendas were performing on the high wire. During the act, Willie would stand under their rigging, holding a small handkerchief as if to catch them should they fall. The gag had been getting laughs all season, and on July 6, while the circus was in Hartford, Connecticut, there was no reason to believe that anything would be different.\n\"As I was putting the finishing touches on my face, I could hear the band playing the waltz music that was my cue to amble into the center ring. At that instant someone ran past the dressing tent yelling \u2018fire.\u2019 I was trying to run in my big flapping shoes and suddenly realized that I was carrying a bucket of wash water I had grabbed when I left the dressing tent.\"\nKelly said that when he saw the big top burning, he knew that he had to help the panicked crowd exit the tent. It was then that he spotted flames burning near one of the large generator wagons. As he tried to douse the small fire with his bucket of water, he nearly became a casualty himself. \"One of the Caterpillar tractors came rumbling along to get that wagon \u2013 to hook on and pull it away from the crowd,\" he recalled. \"It was almost on top of me before I realized what was happening, and as it swung around it did not miss running over me by more than an inch.\"\nKelly's actions that day were immortalized by audience member Ralph Emerson, who took a photograph of Kelly in his full clown make-up and costume, carrying a single bucket of water. The photograph was published in \"Life\" on July 17, 1944.\nThe fire and the loss of 168 lives had a profound impact on Kelly. That night, after the victims had been transported to a temporary morgue, he reflected on what had happened. \"Leaving the showgrounds, I walked past the ruins of the big top and saw some charred shoes and part of a clown doll lying on what had been the hippodrome track. That moment was when the tensions of the past hours broke over me in a wave and I could not keep from crying any longer.\"\nThe fire investigation delayed the show's departure from Hartford for nine days, but on July 15 the trains were headed back to Sarasota, Florida, and within a month, the circus had resumed its tour, playing in stadiums and ballparks. Emmett was among those impressed by the resilience of the big show, telling a reporter \"We must entertain. In war time it is more important than ever. It is going to be great in the open air.\"\nReturn to Hollywood.\nIn 1949, after a charity circus performance in Los Angeles, Emmett was approached by an agent representing David O. Selznick. On October 8, while Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey was in Tucson, Arizona, Kelly signed an exclusive one-year contract.\nAt the age of 51, the idea of starting a new career in motion pictures appealed to Kelly, and when the circus closed in Miami, Florida on November 25, he immediately left for California and Hollywood.\nIn the months that followed various ideas were pitched, until finally he was given a script based on a radio mystery series titled \"The Fat Man.\" In the film, Kelly would be cast as the villain. Although the idea intrigued him, as he read the script, he became concerned. The storyline called for the character to murder three people, then take money that he had stolen from one of the victims and start a circus where he would hide behind his clown makeup. And they wanted Emmett to appear in the film as Willie.\nThe idea of turning his beloved character into a murderer was unacceptable. The producer and director of the film agreed that the killer should not depict the same character that Emmett had spent his career developing. In its review of the film, \"The New York Times\", praised Kelly's acting ability and noted, \"As the ex-convict clown, Mr. Kelly herein demonstrates that circus rings need not be his sole field.\"\nFollowing the release of \"The Fat Man\", Kelly's agent reached out to Cecil B. DeMille who was in Sarasota filming early scenes for \"The Greatest Show on Earth\". The circus allowed Emmett to leave the tour for 15 weeks so that he could join James Stewart and Betty Hutton on the Paramount backlot. Unlike his featured role in \"The Fat Man\", Kelly speaks only one word in the DeMille epic. In the middle of the train wreck scene, Hutton told Emmett to get the clowns ready for the parade, and Kelly responded, \"Parade?\" According to Emmett, it took two takes to get it right.\nWillie appeared in several other scenes that were shot on the Hollywood soundstage, including a number with Hutton and Stewart where the three bounced on a trampoline. In the scene Willie unsuccessfully tried to eat a sandwich as Stewart and Hutton sang the song \"Be a Jumping Jack.\"\nEmmett said that his favorite scene in the film was the segment that showed him playing solitaire on top of a wagon as the circus paraded through the streets of Sarasota. As Willie placed his cards down, his game was interrupted by a sudden gust of wind. Emmett said the effect was accomplished by the blast of an air hose as he played cards against a yellow screen. The special effect was then matched against the parade sequence that had been filmed in February before the season started.\nAlthough Kelly accompanied the Hollywood cast to Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia for the scenes filmed there, the only scenes where he appeared under canvas were during a clown walkaround, the Zoppe riding act, and the aerial ballet. In the big production number filmed on May 22, 1951, Willie strummed a ukulele as Dorothy Lamour sang \"Lovely Luawana Lady\". The rest of his scenes were filmed at Paramount in Hollywood.\nAuthor and later career.\nIn 1954, Kelly met a 21-year-old acrobat named Evi Gebhardt who was part of an act known as The Four Whirlwinds. Their courtship coincided with the release of his autobiography, \"Clown, My Life in Tatters and Smiles,\" co-authored with Ringling press agent F. Beverly Kelley. The story, published by Prentice-Hall, started appearing in bookstores while the circus was at Madison Square Garden that spring. As part of the promotion, Kelly made numerous appearances at bookstores and on radio, and on March 26, 1954, he was one of the first guests to be interviewed on Edward R. Murrow\u2019s new CBS television program \"Person to Person\".\nOne of those who was captivated by Emmett's life story was actor Henry Fonda, who had read the book while he was filming \"Mister Roberts\" in the spring of 1954. By that summer, Fonda acquired the film rights and began making plans to produce the story, either as a television program or a full-length motion picture.\nBecause Emmett's entire life story could not be told in a half-hour, the program focused on his transition from trapeze artist to clown, with Fonda wearing Willie's makeup and actress Dorothy Malone playing Kelly's first wife, Eva. \"Clown\" appeared on the CBS television network on March 27, 1955, and was hosted by Ronald Reagan.\nThe program was filmed on a soundstage at Republic Studios and used the equipment of Herbert Weber's Circo Flamante. During the program, Weber performed on the wire along with the DeWayne teeterboard troupe, Hap Hadley's elephant, and Winston's seals. Faye and Rosie Alexander doubled for Emmett and Eva during the flying return sequence.\nAs part of the publicity blitz for Ringling's 1955 New York engagement, Emmett appeared on another CBS program less than a month later. On April 20, Weary Willie and the Four Whirlwinds appeared on \"I've Got a Secret\". Emmett's secret was the fact that he was getting married the next day to one of the girls in the Whirlwinds\u2019 tumbling act, Evi Gebhardt.\nWhen, on November 6, Evi gave birth to their daughter Stasia, a news photographer named Frank Beatty snapped a picture of a grinning Weary Willie as he spoke by telephone to the new mother. At the same time Beatty was shooting his picture of Emmett, a separate photographer had been dispatched to Sarasota where a photo of Evi and Stasia was also recorded, capturing both sides of the touching telephone conversation.\nAfter 14 years with Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey, 1955 was Emmett's last season with the circus. Although he was already the most recognized clown in America, his family responsibilities, along with myriad new opportunities, were the catalysts that propelled his career to new heights.\nIn the winter of 1956, Kelly was hired to play the role of Willie Voight in an upcoming television program titled \"The Captain from Kopenick\". Under the terms of his 1956 circus contract, Kelly would appear with Ringling only during the indoor dates in New York and at the Boston Garden.\nOn March 11, 1956, the sad-faced Willie was the first guest on the hit television show \"What's My Line?\" Because the character was so well known, each of the panelists was required to put on a mask before Willie appeared on camera. The interview segment that followed was a classic as Emmett stayed in character throughout, never speaking and responding only with a grunt. After Arlene Francis peppered Willie with questions for five minutes, she correctly identified his occupation as a clown and said, while still blindfolded, \"The only clown's name that comes to my mind is Emmett Kelly\".\nThe circus was plagued with labor problems in 1956, and prior to its New York premiere, a picket line was set up outside of Madison Square Garden by both the Teamsters and the American Guild of Variety Artists. Many performers loyal to the circus were conflicted because of their membership in AGVA. Kelly, as well as clown Felix Adler and ringmaster Harold Ronk, chose not to cross the picket line, and their contracts were terminated.\nWithin weeks, Weary Willie was appearing in a 45-minute stage show at New York's Roxy Theatre. \"Circus\" preceded a feature film and included acrobats, animal acts, and trapeze artists, along with performers on ice skates.\nBrooklyn Dodgers.\nIn 1957, attendance for the Brooklyn Dodgers was declining, and owner Walter O'Malley was considering moving the team to Los Angeles. In early January, O'Malley hired Kelly as the official mascot of the team, and in his role, Weary Willie would \"characterize all of Brooklyn when the team loses, and a happy bum when the team wins.\"\nLate in the 1957 season, on the same day that the Dodgers lost the opener during what would be the \"Bums\" final homestand ever in Brooklyn, Evi Kelly gave birth in New York to their second daughter, Monika.\nHollywood, nightclubs and featured clown.\nWhen the baseball season ended and the announcement was made that the Dodgers would be moving to Los Angeles, Kelly was cast in the film \"Wind Across the Everglades\", a movie that was written, produced, and directed by Budd Schulberg, the same filmmaker who had won Best Picture with \"On the Waterfront\" in 1954.\nThe story was set in the early 20th century and told the true tale of poachers who would hunt for egrets and other birds so that they could sell their plumes for women's hats. Emmett was part of an eclectic [one reviewer said \"preposterous\"] cast which included singer Burl Ives, stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, boxer Tony Galento, singer Chana Eden, Christopher Plummer, and Peter Falk. In the film, Emmett played the role of Bigamy Bob, a cutthroat who escaped to the Everglades to get away from his many wives.\nWith another film credit under his belt, Emmett reiterated that he had no intention of retiring his classic character and that he planned \"to bring Willie to the public for as long as I can\".\nThe opportunity to return to the circus ring presented itself in the spring of 1958, when amusement park owner Irving Rosenthal convinced George Hamid and Jerry Collins to combine forces and present the Clyde Beatty &amp; Hamid-Morton Combined Circus under canvas. The show was set up at Rosenthal's Palisades Amusement Park in Fort Lee, New Jersey and competed directly against Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey at Madison Square Garden.\nWith no contract that tied him to any individual show, when Beatty-Hamid-Morton closed at Palisades Park, Emmett was hired by the Cristiani Bros. Circus to appear at its big stands in Philadelphia and Chicago in 1958.\nThe success that Palisades Park in 1958 encouraged Irving Rosenthal to buy out the newly-titled Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. for six weeks in 1959. For Emmett, it was a busy year. After spending five days in January with Cristiani Bros. in Miami, he traveled to both New York and Chicago in February where he made appearances at the big auto shows in those cities. In March, Emmett returned to Palisades Park for the 45-day Beatty-Cole engagement, which again was presented day-and-date against Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey at Madison Square Garden.\nThe following year, Emmett was back at Palisades Park with the \"Royal International Circus,\" produced by Hunt Bros., and when Clyde Beatty-Cole Bros. opened its 1961 season, he was a featured attraction for the first three dates of the season, opening indoors at Commack, Long Island, followed by the New Haven Arena, and then back under canvas at Palisades Park.\nIn 1958, CBS built a new 28-acre amusement park on the Santa Monica beach. Pacific Ocean Park was created to compete directly with Disneyland, and in the summer of 1959, Emmett Kelly was hired for 19 weeks to serve as \"Vice President in Charge of Fun.\"\nThe idea of performing in one place for an extended period appealed to Emmett and Evi, and in 1962, Kelly began a long-term relationship with casino owner Bill Harrah. For the next 15 years, Weary Willie was a regular at the South Shore Room at Harrah's in Lake Tahoe, co-starring with celebrities including Sammy Davis Jr., Lawrence Welk, Jack Benny, Andy Williams, the Smothers Brothers, Ed Sullivan, and Carol Channing. At John Ascuaga\u2019s Nugget in Reno, he and Red Skelton performed together and established a strong friendship.\nIn 1967, he starred in a musical motion picture titled \"The Clown and the Kids.\" The movie was filmed in Bulgaria.\nAs Emmett grew older, his acting ability, along with the complexity of his character, made him a favorite for producers looking to evoke emotion from their audience. In 1973, at the age of 74, Willie was cast in the Boston Opera production of \"The Bartered Bride\". The producer, Sarah Caldwell, was renowned for creating variations of standard operas, and this was no exception.\nThe opera, which was punctuated by scenes of Soviet tanks entering Prague and images of Adolf Hitler, also included an important circus scene where Willie performed both the spotlight routine and made a solo appearance which involved a balloon, a dove, and a pistol. Emmett's association with the avant-garde opera generated headlines nationwide. \"The New York Times\" said, \"Mr. Kelly, like any great performer, has the kind of tact not to seem intrusive even while clowning. His nibbling at a cabbage leaf while he listened to stuttering Vasek's lament was unforgettable.\"\nAlthough Emmett Kelly had been a household name for decades, it was television that exposed Willie to millions of people who never would have attended the circus. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, a new generation came to know the tramp character through those appearances \u2013 among them, a guest spot on Bette Midler\u2019s first network television special which aired just before Christmas 1977. The NBC program was produced by Aaron Russo, one of Hollywood's biggest producers at the time. The program included the spotlight routine and a poignant segment where Midler sang the sentimental song \"Hello in There\" to Willie.\nAlthough he never retired, he could now be very selective in his public appearances, and that flexibility allowed Emmett and Evi to become prominent citizens in Sarasota while at the same time embracing the area's circus heritage. When Karl Wallenda produced the first Showfolks Circus in 1967, Willie and the spotlight were a featured act. In the years that followed, Emmett became a sought-after speaker at circus symposia, and in 1976, he appeared in a one-man show at the new Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall, accompanied by the Sarasota Concert Band.\nWhile Willie was still regularly seen on television commercials and special programs, his last appearances in the circus ring came in a pair of shows produced by Paul Kaye in 1974 at the Capital Centre arena in Landover, Maryland. The all-star production, Circus America, featured The Wallendas, Carol and Wayne Zacchini, Tarzan Zerbini, and The Nerveless Nocks, but the star of the show was Emmett Kelly.\nAfter the Circus America date, Paul Kaye hired Emmett to appear in another show that nearly ended in tragedy. The circus was to be held in Hawaii at the Honolulu International Center. As the troupe was checking luggage at Los Angeles International Airport, a terrorist bomb went off in a nearby locker. \"At first I thought it was a joke,\" Emmett told a reporter. \"Then when I saw the smoke and flying glass, I got scared as hell.\" The explosion killed three people and injured 36 others. Despite the bombing, the performers eventually made their way to Honolulu. Not long after, investigators arrested a Yugoslavian immigrant who was later convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison.\nDeath.\nOn December 9, 1978, Emmett Kelly celebrated his 80th birthday, and although he had been growing visibly weaker, he never stopped working. In February 1979, Emmett appeared in a segment on NBC's \"Today\" Show, and director Mario Pellegrini cast him in a film with Tony Bennett.\n\"A Gift of Love\" was scheduled to begin production in Sarasota on April 2, 1979, and although the picture was later dedicated to Emmett, he did not appear in it. On March 28, 1979, four days before filming was scheduled to begin, the man who had described himself as \"just a farm boy,\" who had become a world-wide icon, died of a heart attack in the front yard of his home.\nAs the news spread, tributes began rushing in. Among those sending condolences was comedienne Carol Burnett, a favorite of Emmett's with whom he had shared the stage on several occasions. \"I had the amazing pleasure and privilege of working with Emmett Kelly,\" she said, \"and I considered him to be a truly gentle clown.\"\nHis long-time friend Red Skelton was saddened. \"Emmett was humanity himself,\" he said, adding, \"You know it is funny such a beautiful leaf fell in the spring. I think we can look at it kind of like he is going out on tour. I guess the angels needed a laugh.\"\nHonors.\nOn August 9, 1956 the Kelly family visited his adopted hometown of Houston, Missouri when the town renamed the open area where he gave his first performance at the \"Old Settlers Reunion\" in 1920 as \"Emmett Kelly Park\" in his honor. Nineteen years later Kelly returned to Houston for a final time when Governor Christopher Bond recognized Houston's former resident by declaring October 9, 1975 as \"Emmett Kelly Day\" in Missouri. Since then the annual \"Emmett Kelly Clown Festival\" has attracted clowns from across the region, including Kelly's grandson, Joey Kelly, who returned to perform as a special guest in 2007. Although the festival ended its original 21-year run in May 2008, it returned in April 2022 when Kelly's daughter, Stasia, was presented with a key to the city.\nKelly was inducted into the Circus Ring of Fame in Sarasota, Florida in 1988 and International Circus Hall of Fame in Peru, Indiana in 1994. On May 1, 1996, a bust of Kelly was dedicated in the \"Hall of Famous Missourians\" at the state capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri.\nLegacy.\nKelly's son, Emmett Kelly Jr., performed a similar \"Weary Willie\" character and as a result the two were estranged for many years. Kelly Jr. died in 2006.\nAccording to the documentary \"Halloween Unmasked\", the choice for the mask of the film's fictional serial killer Michael Myers was down to two: a modified Captain Kirk mask and an Emmett Kelly mask. While the Emmett Kelly mask was unsettling and eerie, it did not quite evoke the creepy feeling they were seeking. The Kirk mask did, resulting in the crew selecting it for the film.\nIn 2023, Emmett Kelly became the protagonist of the award-winning short documentary \"https://\" directed by Constanza H. Hevia and produced by filmmaker and scholar Daniel L. Bernardi.\nIn the 2024 Poker-themed video game \"Balatro\", Kelly serves as the design inspiration for a Joker named \"Vagabond\". This joker's ability is to spawn a Tarot Card after playing a hand while having $4 or less.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\nhttps://"}

He won the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for his musical films \"West Side Story\" (1961) and \"The Sound of Music\" (1965). He was also nominated for Best Film Editing for \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and directed and produced \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966), which was nominated for Best Picture.\nAmong his other films are \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945), \"Born to Kill\" (1947), \"The Set-Up\" (1949), \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), \"Destination Gobi\" (1953), \"This Could Be The Night\" (1957), \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (1958), \"I Want to Live!\" (1958), \"The Haunting\" (1963), \"The Andromeda Strain\" (1971), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975) and \"\" (1979).\nHe was the president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975 and the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences from 1985 through 1988.\nWise achieved critical success as a director in a striking variety of film genres: horror-noir, western, war, film noir, horror, science fiction, musical and drama, with many repeat successes within each genre. Wise's meticulous preparation may have been largely motivated by studio budget constraints, but advanced the moviemaking art. He received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1998.\nEarly years.\nRobert Earl Wise was born in Winchester, Indiana, the youngest son of Olive R. (n\u00e9e Longenecker) and Earl W. Wise, a meat packer. He had an elder brother, David. The family moved to Connersville, Fayette County, Indiana, where Wise attended public schools. As a youth Wise's favorite pastime was going to the movies. As a student at Connersville High School, Wise wrote humor and sports columns for the school's newspaper and was a member of the yearbook staff and poetry club. Wise initially sought a career in journalism and following graduation from high school attended Franklin College, a small liberal arts college south of Indianapolis, Indiana, on a scholarship. In 1933, due to the family's poor financial situation during the Great Depression, Wise was unable to return to college for his second year and moved to Hollywood to begin a lifelong career in the film industry. Wise's older brother, David, who had gone to Hollywood several years earlier and worked at RKO Pictures, found his younger brother a job in the shipping department at RKO. Wise worked odd jobs at the studio before moving into editing.\nEarly career.\nWise began his film career at RKO as a sound and music editor. In the 1930s, RKO was a budget-minded studio with \"a strong work ethic\" and \"willingness to take artistic risks\", which was fortunate for a newcomer to Hollywood such as Wise. At RKO, Wise became an assistant to T.K. Wood, the studio's head sound-effects editor. Wise's first screen credit was a ten-minute short subject called \"A Trip through Fijiland\" (1935), which was made from RKO footage salvaged from an abandoned feature film.\nAs Wise gained experience, he became more interested in editing film content, rather than sound, and went to work for RKO film editor William \"Billy\" Hamilton. Wise's first film as Hamilton's assistant was Alfred Santell's \"Winterset\" (1936). Wise continued to work with Hamilton on other films, including \"Stage Door\" (1937), \"Having Wonderful Time\" (1938) and \"The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle\" (1939). In \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\" (1939) and \"5th Ave Girl\" (1939), Hamilton and Wise, as assistant film editor, shared screen credit; it was Wise's first credit on a feature film. Wise's first solo film editing work was on \"Bachelor Mother\" (1939) and \"My Favorite Wife\" (1939).\nAt RKO, Wise worked with Orson Welles on \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and was nominated for the Academy Award for Film Editing. Wise was the film's last living crew member.\nThough Wise worked as an editor on \"Citizen Kane\", it is likely that while working on the film he became familiar with the optical printer techniques employed by Linwood Dunn, inventor of the practical optical printer, to produce effects for \"Citizen Kane\" such as the image projected in the broken snowglobe which falls from Kane's hand as he dies.\nIn \"Citizen Kane\", Welles used a deep-focus technique, in which heavy lighting is employed to achieve sharp focus for both foreground and background in the frame. Wise later used the technique in films that he directed. Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" also influenced Wise's innovations in the use of sound in films such as \"The Set-Up\" (1949), where Wise limited music to in-film sources, and in \"Executive Suite\" (1954), which used no music. In addition, biographical films or biographical profiles of fictionalized characters such as Charles Foster Kane were often the subjects of Wise's later work, including \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956), \"I Want to Live!\" (1958), \"The Sound of Music\" (1965), \"So Big\" (1953), \"Run Silent, Run Deep\" (1958) and \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966), among others. Wise also worked as editor on Welles' next film for RKO, \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). While working as a film editor, Wise was called on to shoot additional scenes for the film. After Welles was dismissed from the studio, Wise continued editing films such as \"Seven Days Leave\" (1942), \"Bombardier\" (1943) and \"The Fallen Sparrow\" (1943), before he received his first directing assignment.\nDirector and producer.\nFor Wise, connecting to the viewer was the \"most important part of making a film.\" Wise also had a reputation for a strong work ethic and budget-minded frugality. In addition, he was known for his attention to detail and well-researched preparation for a film. For example, before directing \"Until They Sail\" (1957), set in New Zealand during World War II, Wise traveled to New Zealand to interview women whose lives were similar to those portrayed in the film. Wise's attention to detail also extended to foreign locales. While in New Zealand doing research for the film, Wise also scouted background shots for the film's second-unit crew, even though the main film was shot on MGM's back lot in California. He also shot films on location, such as \"Mystery in Mexico\" (1948), a minor B-movie thriller filmed in Mexico City.\nWise's films often included lessons on racial tolerance. For example, Native Americans, Muslims, Hispanics and African Americans were featured in such films as \"Two Flags West\" (1950), \"This Could Be the Night\" (1957), \"The Set-Up\" (1949) and \"Odds Against Tomorrow\" (1959), and \"West Side Story\" (1961). \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966) featured the story of a biracial couple, and Jewish characters were included in \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956), \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951), and \"The House on Telegraph Hill\" (1951).\nAt RKO, Wise got his first credited directing job in 1944 while working for Hollywood horror film producer Val Lewton. Wise replaced the original director on the horror film \"The Curse of the Cat People\" (1944), when it fell behind schedule. The film, a well received \"dark fantasy about a solitary child and her imaginary friend\", was a departure from the horror films of the day. In many of Wise's films, but especially in \"Curse of the Cat People\", the melodrama used a vulnerable child or childlike character to challenge a dark, adult world. Lewton promoted Wise to his superiors at RKO, beginning a collaboration that produced the notable horror film \"The Body Snatcher\" (1945), starring Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi. Wise identified the film as a personal favorite and its rave reviews also helped establish his career as a director.\nBetween \"Curse\" and \"Snatcher\", Wise directed \"Mademoiselle Fifi\" (1944), an adaptation of two Guy de Maupassant short stories that explored man's darker side with a political subtext. \"Fifi\"'s feminist perspective and a memorable chase sequence helped make it a \"template picture for Wise\". Wise also directed film noir, among them the Lawrence Tierney noir classic \"Born to Kill\" (1947), and \"Blood on the Moon\" (1948), a noir Western starring Robert Mitchum as a cowboy drifter that included memorable night sequences.\nHis last film for RKO \"The Set-Up\" (1949) was a realistic boxing movie in which Wise portrayed the sport as cruel and exploitative. The film also included choreographed fight scenes and \"set the bar\" for other fight films. The film earned the Critic's Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Wise's use and mention of time in this film would echo in later noir films such as Stanley Kubrick's \"The Killing\" (1956) and Quentin Tarantino's \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994).\nIn the 1950s, he proved adept in several genres, including science fiction in \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951); melodrama in \"So Big\" (1953); Western in \"Tribute to a Bad Man\" (1956), starring James Cagney; fictionalized biography in the boardroom drama \"Executive Suite\" (1954); and the epic \"Helen of Troy\" (1955) based on Homer's \"Iliad\". \"Three Secrets\" (1950), a soap opera/family melodrama, gave Wise a chance to work with actress Patricia Neal \"in a landmark performance about gender double standards\". Neal starred in two more Wise films: \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" (1951) and \"Something for the Birds\" (1952). \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", a science fiction thriller that warned about the dangers of atomic warfare, included a realistic setting and an emphasis on the story instead of special effects. The film received \"overwhelmingly positive\" reviews and has become \"one of the most enduring and influential science fiction films ever made, and among the first produced by a major studio.\"\nThe biography of convicted killer Barbara Graham in \"I Want to Live!\" (1958), featured Susan Hayward's Oscar-winning performance as Graham and earned Wise his first nomination for Best Director. The film became one of the top-grossing pictures of 1959 and was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Screenplay from another medium and Best (black and white) Cinematography. In addition, \"Executive Suite\" earned Wise a Best Director nomination from the Motion Picture Academy, the Venice Film Festival, and the Directors Guild of America. The film was awarded Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated it for Best Film. Other Wise-directed films from the 1950s include \"Somebody Up There Likes Me\" (1956), a portrait of boxer Rocky Graziano, starring Paul Newman; Wise's first overt comedy, \"Something for the Birds\" (1952); the action comedy \"Destination Gobi\" (1953); and \"The Desert Rats\" (1953), a more traditional war film.\nIn the 1960s, Wise directed three films adapted from the Broadway stage: \"West Side Story\" (1961), \"Two for the Seesaw\" (1962) and \"The Sound of Music\" (1965). In 1961, teamed with Jerome Robbins, Wise won the Academy Award for Best Director for \"West Side Story\", which Wise also produced. Wise and Robbins were the first duo to share an Academy Award for directing. Wise won a second Oscar, for Best Picture, as the film's producer, \"West Side Story\" won ten out of its 11 Academy Award nominations: Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (George Chakiris), Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), Cinematography (color), Art/Set Decoration (color), Sound, Scoring of a Musical Picture, Editing, and Costume Design (color). It lost for Best Screenplay based on material from another medium to \"Judgment at Nuremberg\" (1961). \"West Side Story\" was a box-office hit, and critics have declared it \"a cinema masterpiece\".\nPrior to directing \"The Sound of Music\" (1965), Wise directed the psychological horror film \"The Haunting\" (1963), starring Julie Harris, in an adaptation of Shirley Jackson's novel \"The Haunting of Hill House\". Wise's big-budget adaptation of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein's family-oriented musical \"The Sound of Music\", with Julie Andrews as Maria and Christopher Plummer as Captain von Trapp, became one of film history's highest-grossing movies. Wise won Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for \"The Sound of Music\" for 1965. Wise struggled to keep \"The Sound of Music\" from being an overly sweet, sentimental story by cutting lesser-known songs and adding new dialogue to improve transitions. In addition to garnering Wise two Oscars, the film won three more for editing, sound and scoring of music for an adaptation.\n\"The Sound of Music\" was an interim film for Wise, produced to mollify the studio while he developed the difficult film \"The Sand Pebbles\" (1966), starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, and Candice Bergen. \"The Sand Pebbles\", Wise's critically acclaimed film epic, was a parable of the Vietnam War, with an antiwar director and message. McQueen received his only Oscar nomination for his performance in the film. Set in the late 1920s in China, this was an early entry in a series of Vietnam War era films followed by \"Catch-22\" and \"M*A*S*H\". Excellent reviews for \"The Sand Pebbles\" marked Wise's last \"creative peak\" in his long career. \"Star!\" (1968), with Julie Andrews in the lead as Gertrude Lawrence, failed at the box office, although it was consistent with Wise's other successful films that portrayed a strong woman \"whose life choices invite melodramatic relationships.\" Andrews was cast against type, but Wise, as the film's director, took responsibility for the film's shortcomings.\nIn the 1970s, Wise directed such films as \"The Andromeda Strain\" (1971), \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), the horror film \"Audrey Rose\" (1977) and \"\" (1979), the first \"Star Trek\" feature film.\nWise's adaptation of Michael Crichton's science-fiction thriller, \"The Andromeda Strain\" (1971), an anti-biological warfare film, was a \"modest critical hit.\" His next film, \"Two People\" (1973), starring Peter Fonda and Lindsay Wagner, got \"poor reviews\" and is \"one of Wise's least-seen movies.\" \"The Hindenburg\" (1975), which profiles the 1937 crash of the eponymous airship, was panned by critics, although it won Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects. Wise's \"Audrey Rose\" (1977), a reincarnation thriller, received mixed reviews and was \"sometimes criticized for being an \"Exorcist\" (1973) knockoff.\"\n\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\" (1979), the first of the feature films based on the popular television series, was a difficult shoot for Wise. Popular film critic Leonard Maltin called it \"Slow, talky, and derivative, somewhat redeemed by terrific special effects\". The film was a box office hit but a critical failure.\nWise was Ilya and Alexander Salkind's first choice to direct the \"Superman\" spin-off \"Supergirl\" after Richard Lester departed the franchise, but he declined. Wise also was considered to direct the 1985 holiday film \"\" and the 1988 horror film \"Child's Play\" introducing the slasher villain Chucky. In 1989, Wise directed \"Rooftops\", his last theatrical feature film. The low-budget musical \"opened and closed with no fanfare.\" At age 86, Wise directed \"A Storm in Summer\" (2000) for Showtime (cable television). Starring Peter Falk, it was his only made-for-television movie, airing in 2001, and won a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Children's Special.\nLater years.\nWise, a lifelong liberal, contributed to charitable organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, and established the Robert E. Wise Foundation to provide financial assistance to causes in the Los Angeles area. Wise's private papers are housed at the University of Southern California.\nAs Wise's directing career slowed, he took a more active role in supporting the film industry. He became a governor of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1966 and served for 19 years until becoming president from 1985 through 1988. He had previously been president of the Directors Guild of America from 1971 to 1975. He also sat on the Board of Trustees of the American Film Institute and chaired its Center for Advanced Film Studies. Wise was named chairman of the Directors Guild of America's special projects committee in 1980, organizing its fiftieth anniversary celebration in New York in 1986. In addition, Wise was a leading member of the National Council of the Arts and Sciences, the Department of Film at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Motion Picture Country House and Hospital.\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s Wise served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.\nWise also encouraged young filmmakers and responded to inquiries from fans and film students. Wise supervised Emilio Estevez's debut as a director in \"Wisdom\" (1986) and was its executive producer. Wise also made a cameo performance in John Landis' \"The Stupids\" (1996).\nIn his later years, Wise continued to be active in productions of DVD versions of his films, including making public appearances promoting those films. His last contributions were to the DVD commentaries of \"The Sound of Music\", \"The Haunting\" and \"The Set-Up\". He also oversaw the DVD commentaries of \"The Sand Pebbles\" and \"Executive Suite\". He also oversaw and provided DVD commentary for his Director's Edition of \"\", which included re-edited scenes, new optical effects and a new sound mix. This was the director's final project before his death.\nPersonal life.\nOn May 25, 1942, Wise married actress Patricia Doyle. Throughout their long life together, Wise and his wife enjoyed entertaining and traveling, before she died of cancer on September 22, 1975. The couple had one son, Robert, who became an assistant cameraman. On January 29, 1977, Wise married Millicent Franklin. Millicent died on August 31, 2010, at Cedars-Sinai Hospital, Los Angeles.\nWise had an expansive bungalow on the Universal Studios lot and owned a modern California beach house. He continued to screen films for personal enjoyment and had \"final cut\" decisions on his films.\nWise suffered a heart attack and was rushed to UCLA Medical Center, where he died of heart failure on September 14, 2005, four days after his 91st birthday.\nFilmography.\nEditor\nExecutive producer\nOther roles\nAccolades.\nWise was a 4-time Oscar-winner (Best Director and Best Picture, 1961 and 1965) and also received the Academy's Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (1966); the D.W. Griffith Award (1988) from the Directors Guild of America for outstanding lifetime achievement; the National Medal of Arts (1992); AFI's Lifetime Achievement Award (1998); and the Society of Motion Picture and Television Art Directors career award for \"outstanding contribution to cinematic imagery\" (1998). Wise also has a star (#6340) on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nIn 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild published a list of the 75 best-edited films of all time based on a survey of its membership. \"Citizen Kane\", which Wise had edited early in his career, was listed second.\nIn Indiana, Governor Roger D.

He is known for his colossal building projects. Among these works are the rebuilding of the Second Temple in Jerusalem and the expansion of its base\u2014the Western Wall being part of it. Many of the crucial details of his life are recorded in the works of the 1st century\u00a0CE Roman\u2013Jewish historian Josephus.\nDespite Herod's successes, including forging a new aristocracy, he has been criticized by various historians. His reign polarizes historians\u2019 opinions, some viewing his legacy as evidence of success, and some viewing it as evidence of tyranny.\nHerod the Great is described in the Christian Bible as the coordinator of the Massacre of the Innocents. Most of the New Testament references are to his son Herod Antipas (such as the events leading to the executions of John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth in ), or his grandson Herod Agrippa (in ). Upon Herod's death in 4\u00a0BCE, the Romans divided his kingdom among three of his sons and his sister: his son Herod Antipas received the tetrarchy of Galilee and Peraea.\nOther family members of Herod the Great include Herod's son Herod Archelaus, who became ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea; Herod's son Philip who became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan River; and Herod's sister Salome I, who was given a toparchy including the cities of Jabneh, Ashdod, and Fasayil (Phasaelis).\nBiography.\nHerod was born around 72\u00a0BCE in Idumea, south of Judea. He was the second son of Antipater the Idumaean, a high-ranking official under ethnarch Hyrcanus II, and Cypros, a Nabatean Arab princess from Petra, in present-day Jordan. Herod's father was by descent an Edomite; his ancestors had been forcibly converted to Judaism. Herod was raised as a Jew. Strabo, a contemporary of Herod, held that the Idumaeans, whom he identified as of Nabataean origin, constituted the majority of the population of western Judea, where they commingled with the Judaeans and adopted their customs. This is a view shared also by some modern scholarly works which consider Idumaeans to be either Arab or Nabataean in origin. Thus, Herod's ethnic background was Arab on both sides of his family. According to Josephus, Herod was a descendant of Eleazar Maccabeus (Auran) of the Hasmoneans.\nHerod rose to power largely through his father's good relations with the Roman general and dictator Julius Caesar, who entrusted Antipater with the public affairs of Judea. Herod was appointed provincial governor of Galilee in c.\u200947\u00a0BCE, when he was about either 25 or 28 years old (Greek original: \"15 years of age\"). There he faithfully farmed the taxes of that region for the Roman Senate, and he met with success in ridding that region of bandits. Antipater's eldest son, Phasael, served in the same capacity as governor of Jerusalem. During this time, the young Herod cultivated a good relationship with Sextus Caesar, the acting Roman governor of Syria, who appointed Herod as general of Coelesyria and Samaria, greatly expanding his sphere of influence. He enjoyed the backing of Rome, but the Sanhedrin condemned his brutality. When yet a private man, Herod had determined to punish Hyrcanus the Hasmonean king, who had once summoned Herod to stand trial for murder, but Herod was restrained from doing so by the intervention of his father and his elder brother.\nIn 41\u00a0BCE, the Roman leader Mark Antony named Herod and his brother Phasael as tetrarchs. They were placed in this role to support Hyrcanus\u00a0II. In 40\u00a0BCE Antigonus, Hyrcanus' nephew, took the Judean throne from his uncle with the help of the Parthians. Herod fled to Rome to plead with the Romans to restore Hyrcanus\u00a0II to power. The Romans had a special interest in Judea because their general Pompey the Great had conquered Jerusalem in 63\u00a0BCE, thus placing the region in the Roman sphere of influence. In Rome, Herod was unexpectedly appointed King of the Jews by the Roman Senate. Josephus puts this in the year of the consulship of Calvinus and Pollio (40\u00a0BCE), but Appian places it in 39\u00a0BCE. Herod went back to Judea to win his kingdom from Antigonus. Toward the end of the campaign against Antigonus, Herod married the granddaughter of Hyrcanus\u00a0II, Mariamne (known as Mariamne\u00a0I), who was also a niece of Antigonus. Herod did this in an attempt to secure his claim to the throne and gain some Jewish favor. However, Herod already had a wife, Doris, and a young son, Antipater, and chose therefore to banish Doris and her child.\nHerod and Sosius, the governor of Syria, at the behest of Mark Antony, set out with a large army in 37\u00a0BCE and captured Jerusalem, Herod then sending Antigonus for execution to Mark Antony. From this moment, Herod took the role as sole ruler of Judea and the title of \"basileus\" for himself, ushering in the Herodian dynasty and ending the Hasmonean Dynasty. Josephus reports this as being in the year of the consulship of Agrippa and Gallus (37\u00a0BCE), but also says that it was exactly 27 years after Jerusalem fell to Pompey, which would indicate 36\u00a0BCE. Cassius Dio also reports that in 37, \"the Romans accomplished nothing worthy of note\" in the area. According to Josephus, Herod ruled for 37 years, 34 of them after capturing Jerusalem.\nAs some believe Herod's family were converts to Judaism, his religious commitment was questioned by some elements of Jewish society. When John Hyrcanus conquered the region of Idumaea (the Edom of the Hebrew Bible) in 140\u2013130\u00a0BCE, he required all Idumaeans to obey Jewish law or to leave; most Idumaeans thus converted to Judaism, which meant that they had to be circumcised, and many intermarried with the Jews and adopted their customs. While Herod publicly identified himself as a Jew and was considered as such by some, this religious identification was undermined by the decadent lifestyle of the Herodians, which would have earned them the antipathy of observant Jews.\nHerod later executed several members of his own family, including his wife Mariamne I.\nReign in Judea.\nHerod's rule marked a new beginning in the history of Judea. Judea had been ruled autonomously by the Hasmonean kings from 140 until 63\u00a0BCE. The Hasmonean kings retained their titles, but became clients of Rome after the conquest by Pompey in 63\u00a0BCE. Herod overthrew the Hasmonean Antigonus in a three-year-long war between 37 and 34\u00a0BCE, ruled under Roman overlordship until his death c.\u20094\u00a0BCE, and officially passed on the throne to his sons, thus establishing his own, so-called Herodian dynasty.\nHerod was granted the title of \"King of Judea\" by the Roman Senate. As such, he was a vassal of the Roman Empire, expected to support the interests of his Roman patrons. Nonetheless, just when Herod obtained leadership in Judea, his rule faced two threats. The first threat came from his mother-in-law Alexandra, who sought to regain power for her family, the Hasmoneans, whose dynasty Herod had overthrown in 37\u00a0BCE (see Siege of Jerusalem). In the same year, Cleopatra married the Roman leader Antony. Recognizing Cleopatra's influence over Antony, Alexandra asked Cleopatra for aid in making Aristobulus III the High Priest. As a member of the Hasmonean family, Aristobulus III might partially repair the fortunes of the Hasmoneans if made High Priest. Alexandra's request was made, but Cleopatra urged Alexandra to leave Judea with Aristobulus III and visit Antony. Herod received word of this plot, and feared that if Antony met Aristobolus III in person he might name Aristobulus III King of Judea. This concern induced Herod, in 35\u00a0BCE, to order the assassination of Aristobulus, ending this first threat to Herod's throne. The marriage of 37\u00a0BCE also sparked a power struggle between Roman leaders Octavian, who would later be called Augustus, and Antony. Herod, owing his throne to Rome, had to pick a side, and he chose Antony. In 31 at Actium, Antony lost to Octavian, posing a second threat to Herod's rule. Herod had to regain Octavian's support if he was to keep his throne. At Rhodes in 31\u00a0BCE, Herod, through his ability to keep Judea open to Rome as a link to the wealth of Syria and Egypt, and ability to defend the frontier, convinced Octavian that he would be loyal to him. Herod continued to rule his subjects as he saw fit. Despite the autonomy afforded to Herod in his internal reign over Judea, restrictions were placed upon him in his relations with other kingdoms.\nHerod's support from the Roman Empire was a major factor in enabling him to maintain his authority over Judea. There have been mixed interpretations concerning Herod's popularity during his reign. In \"The Jewish War\", Josephus characterizes Herod's rule in generally favorable terms, and gives Herod the benefit of the doubt for the infamous events that took place during his reign. However, in his later work, \"Antiquities of the Jews\", Josephus emphasizes the tyrannical authority that many scholars have come to associate with Herod's reign.\nHerod's despotic rule has been demonstrated by many of his security measures aimed at suppressing the contempt his people, especially Jews, had towards him. For instance, it has been suggested that Herod used secret police to monitor and report the feelings of the general populace toward him. He sought to prohibit protests, and had opponents removed by force. He had a bodyguard of 2,000 soldiers. Josephus describes various units of Herod's personal guard taking part in Herod's funeral, including the \"Doryphnoroi\", and a Thracian, Celtic (probably Gallic) and Germanic contingent. While the term \"Doryphnoroi\" does not have an ethnic connotation, the unit was probably composed of distinguished veteran soldiers and young men from the most influential Jewish families. Thracians had served in the Jewish armies since the Hasmonean dynasty, while the Celtic contingent were former bodyguards of Cleopatra given as a gift by Augustus to Herod following the Battle of Actium. The Germanic contingent was modeled upon Augustus's personal bodyguard, the \"Germani Corporis Custodes\", responsible for guarding the palace.\nHerod undertook many colossal building projects. Around 19\u00a0BCE, he began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount. In addition to fully rebuilding and enlarging the Second Jewish Temple, he artificially expanded the platform on which it stood, doubling it in size. Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In addition, Herod also used the latest technology in hydraulic cement and underwater construction to build the harbor at Caesarea Maritima. While Herod's zeal for building transformed Judea, his motives were not selfless. Although he built fortresses (Masada, Herodium, Alexandrium, Hyrcania, and Machaerus) in which he and his family could take refuge in case of insurrection, these vast projects were also intended to gain the support of the Jews and improve his reputation as a leader. Herod also built Sebaste and other pagan cities because he wanted to appeal to the country's substantial pagan population. In order to fund these projects, Herod utilized a Hasmonean taxation system that heavily burdened the Judean people. Nevertheless, these enterprises brought employment and opportunities for the people's provision. In some instances, Herod took it upon himself to provide for his people in times of need, such as during a severe famine that occurred in 25\u00a0BCE.\nAlthough he made many attempts at conforming to traditional Jewish laws, there were more instances where Herod was insensitive, which constitutes one of the major Jewish complaints of Herod as highlighted in Josephus' \"Antiquities of the Jews\". In Jerusalem, Herod introduced foreign forms of entertainment, and erected a golden eagle at the entrance of the Temple, which suggested a greater interest in the welfare of Rome than of Jews. Herod's taxes garnered a bad reputation: his constant concern for his reputation led him to make frequent, expensive gifts, increasingly emptying the kingdom's coffers, and such lavish spending upset his Jewish subjects. The two major Jewish sects of the day, the Pharisees and the Sadducees, both showed opposition to Herod. The Pharisees were discontented because Herod disregarded many of their demands with respect to the Temple's construction. The Sadducees, who were closely associated with priestly responsibilities in the Temple, opposed Herod because he replaced their high priests with outsiders from Babylonia and Alexandria, in an effort to gain support from the Jewish Diaspora. Herod's outreach efforts gained him little, and at the end of his reign anger and dissatisfaction were common amongst Jews. Heavy outbreaks of violence and riots followed Herod's death in many cities, including Jerusalem, as pent-up resentments boiled over. The scope of the disturbances sparked hopes that the Jews of Judea might some day overthrow the Roman overlords, hopes reawakened decades later in the outbreak of the First Jewish\u2013Roman War in 66\u00a0CE.\nHerod and Augustus.\nThe relationship between Herod and Augustus demonstrates the fragile politics of a deified Emperor and a King who ruled over the Jewish people and their holy lands. As they interacted, Herod's desire to satisfy both the Jewish and non-Jewish people of his kingdom had to be balanced with satisfying Augustus' aim to spread the culture, architecture and values of Rome throughout his empire. The sway of Augustus and the Roman Empire on the policy led to the use of Romanized construction throughout Herod's Kingdom. An example of Herod's architectural expansion of Judea in devotion to Rome can be seen with the third temple he commissioned, the Augusteum, a temple dedicated to Augustus.\nArchitectural achievements.\nHerod's most famous and ambitious project was the expansion of the Second Temple in Jerusalem which was undertaken so that he would \"have a capital city worthy of his dignity and grandeur\", and with this reconstruction, Herod hoped to gain more support from the Jews. Recent findings suggest that the Temple Mount walls and Robinson's Arch may not have been completed until at least 20 years after his death, during the reign of Herod Agrippa II.\nIn the 18th year of his reign (20\u201319\u00a0BCE), Herod rebuilt the Temple on \"a more magnificent scale\". Although work on out-buildings and courts continued for another 80 years, the new Temple was finished in a year and a half. To comply with religious law, Herod employed 1,000 priests as masons and carpenters in the rebuilding. The finished temple, which was destroyed in 70\u00a0CE, is sometimes referred to as Herod's Temple. Today, only the four retaining walls remain standing, including the Western Wall. These walls created a flat platform (the Temple Mount) upon which the Temple was then constructed.\nHerod's other achievements include the development of water supplies for Jerusalem, building fortresses such as Masada and Herodium, and founding new cities such as Caesarea Maritima and the enclosures of Cave of the Patriarchs and Mamre in Hebron. He and Cleopatra owned a monopoly over the extraction of asphalt from the Dead Sea, which was used in shipbuilding. He leased copper mines on Cyprus from the Roman emperor.\nNew Testament references.\nThe Gospel of Matthew describes an episode known as the Massacre of the Innocents. According to this account, after the birth of Jesus, a group of magi from the East visited Herod to inquire the whereabouts of \"the one having been born king of the Jews\", because they had seen his star in the east (or, according to certain translations, at its rising) and therefore wanted to pay him homage. Herod, as King of the Jews, was alarmed at the prospect of a usurper. Herod assembled the chief priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the \"Anointed One\" (the Messiah, ) was to be born. They answered, in Bethlehem, citing . Herod therefore sent the magi to Bethlehem, instructing them to search for the child and, after they had found him, to \"report to me, so that I too may go and worship him\". However, after they had found Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to report back to Herod. Similarly, Joseph was warned in a dream that Herod intended to kill Jesus, so he and his family fled to Egypt. When Herod realized he had been outwitted, he gave orders to kill all boys of the age of two and under in Bethlehem and its vicinity. Joseph and his family stayed in Egypt until Herod's death, then moved to Nazareth in Galilee to avoid living under Herod's son Archelaus.\nMost modern biographers of Herod, and a majority of biblical scholars, dismiss Matthew's story as a literary device. Contemporary non-biblical sources, including Josephus and the surviving writings of Nicolaus of Damascus (who knew Herod personally), provide no corroboration for Matthew's account of the massacre, and it is not mentioned in the Gospel of Luke. Classical historian Michael Grant states \"[t]he tale is not history but myth or folk-lore\", while Peter Richardson notes that the story's absence from the Gospel of Luke and the accounts of Josephus \"work[s] against the account's accuracy\". Richardson suggests that the event in Matthew's gospel was inspired by Herod's murder of his own sons. Jodi Magness has said that \"many scholars believe that the massacre of the innocents never occurred, but instead was inspired by Herod's reputation\". Others, such as Paul Maier, suggest that since Bethlehem was a smaller town, the slaughter of about a half dozen children would not have warranted a mention from Josephus.\nDeath.\nHerod died in Jericho, after an unidentified but excruciatingly painful, putrefying illness, known to posterity as \"Herod's Evil\". Josephus states that the pain of his illness led Herod to attempt suicide by stabbing, and that the attempt was thwarted by his cousin. In some much later narratives and depictions, the attempt succeeds; for example, in the 12th-century Eadwine Psalter. Other medieval dramatizations, such as the \"Ordo Rachelis\", follow Josephus' account.\nJosephus stated that Herod was so concerned that no one would mourn his death that he commanded a large group of distinguished men to come to Jericho, and he gave an order that they should be killed at the time of his death so that the displays of grief that he craved would take place; his brother-in-law Alexas and his sister Salome did not carry out this wish.\nDating.\nMost scholarship concerning the date of Herod's death follows Emil Sch\u00fcrer's calculations, which suggest that the date was in or around 4\u00a0BCE; this is three years earlier than the previous consensus and tradition (1\u00a0BCE).\nTwo of Herod's sons, Archelaus and Philip the Tetrarch, dated their rule from 4\u00a0BCE, though Archelaus apparently held royal authority during Herod's lifetime. Philip's reign would last for 37 years, until his death in the 20th year of Tiberius (34\u00a0CE), which implies his accession as 4\u00a0BCE.\nSome scholars support the traditional date of 1\u00a0BCE for Herod's death.\nFilmer, for example, proposes that Herod died in 1\u00a0BCE, and that his heirs backdated their reigns to 4\u00a0or 3\u00a0BCE to assert an overlapping with Herod's rule, and bolster their own legitimacy. Based on the coins of Herod's sons Steinmann and Young argue that Herod's sons antedated their reigns to 6\u00a0BCE before Herod's death so that their reigns cannot be used to argue for a 4\u00a0BCE date for Herod's death.\nIn Josephus' account, Herod's death was preceded by first a Jewish fast day (10 Tevet\u00a03761/Sun 24 Dec 1\u00a0BCE), a lunar eclipse and followed by Passover (27 March 1\u00a0CE). Objections to the 4\u00a0BCE date include the assertion that there was not nearly enough time between the eclipse on March\u00a013 and Passover on April\u00a010 for the recorded events surrounding Herod's death to have taken place.\nIn 66\u00a0CE, Eleazar ben Hanania compiled the Megillat Taanit, which contains two unattributed entries for cause of festivity: 7 Kislev and 2 Shevat. A later Scholion (commentary) on the Megillat Taanit attributes the 7 Kislev festivity to king Herod the Great's death (no year is mentioned). Some scholars ignore the Scholion and attribute the 2 Shevat date instead to Herod's death.\nSuccessors.\nAugustus respected the terms of Herod's will, which stipulated the division of Herod's kingdom among three of his sons. Augustus recognised Herod's son Herod Archelaus as ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea from c.\u20094\u00a0BCE\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20096\u00a0CE. Augustus then judged Archelaus incompetent to rule, removed him from power, and combined the provinces of Samaria, Judea proper, and Idumea into Iudaea province. This enlarged province was ruled by a prefect until the year 41\u00a0CE. As to Herod's other sons, Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Peraea from Herod's death to 39\u00a0CE when he was deposed and exiled. Philip became tetrarch of territories north and east of the Jordan, namely Iturea, Trachonitis, Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis and Paneas, and ruled until his death in 34\u00a0CE.\nHerod's tomb.\nThe location of Herod's tomb is documented by Josephus, who writes, \"And the body was carried two hundred furlongs, to Herodium, where he had given order to be buried.\" Professor Ehud Netzer, an archaeologist from the Hebrew University, read the writings of Josephus and focused his search on the vicinity of the pool and its surroundings. An article in the \"New York Times\" states,\nLower Herodium consists of the remains of a large palace, a race track, service quarters, and a monumental building whose function is still a mystery. Perhaps, says Ehud Netzer, who excavated the site, it is Herod's mausoleum. Next to it is a pool, almost twice as large as modern Olympic-size pools.\nOn May 7, 2007, an Israeli team of archaeologists of Hebrew University, led by Netzer, announced they had discovered the tomb. The site is located at the exact location given by Josephus, atop tunnels and water pools, at a flattened desert site, halfway up the hill to Herodium, south of Jerusalem. The tomb contained a broken sarcophagus but no remains of a body.\nNot all scholars agree with Netzer: in an article for the \"Palestine Exploration Quarterly\", archaeologist David Jacobson (University of Oxford) wrote that \"these finds are not conclusive on their own and they also raise new questions.\" In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas also challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod's and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter's death, stood by the identification.\nThe Israel Nature and Parks Authority and the Gush Etzion Regional Council intend to recreate the tomb out of a light plastic material, a proposal that has received strong criticism from major Israeli archeologists.\nOpinions of his reign.\nMacrobius (c.\u2009400\u00a0CE), one of the last pagan writers in Rome, in his book \"Saturnalia\", wrote: \"When it was heard that, as part of the slaughter of boys up to two years old, Herod, king of the Jews, had ordered his own son to be killed, he [the Emperor Augustus] remarked, 'It is better to be Herod's pig [Gr. hys] than his son' [Gr. hyios]\". This was a reference of how Herod, as a Jew, would not kill pigs, but had three of his sons, and many others, killed.\nAccording to contemporary historians, Herod the Great \"is perhaps the only figure in ancient Jewish history who has been loathed equally by Jewish and Christian posterity\", depicted both by Jews and Christians as a tyrant and bloodthirsty ruler. The study of Herod's reign includes polarizing opinions on the man himself. Modern critics have described him as \"the evil genius of the Judean nation\", and as one who would be \"prepared to commit any crime in order to gratify his unbounded ambition.\" His extraordinary spending spree is cited as one of the causes of the serious impoverishment of the people he ruled, adding to the opinion that his reign was exclusively negative. Herod's religious policies gained a mixed response from the Jewish populace. Although Herod considered himself king of the Jews, he let it be known that he also represented the non-Jews living in Judea, building temples for other religions outside of the Jewish areas of his kingdom. Many Jews questioned the authenticity of Herod's Judaism on account of his Idumean background and his infamous murders of members of his family. However, he generally respected traditional Jewish observances in his public life. For instance, he minted coins without human images to be used in Jewish areas and acknowledged the sanctity of the Second Temple by employing priests as artisans in its construction.\nAlong with holding some respect for the Jewish culture in his public life, there is also evidence of Herod's sensitivity toward Jewish traditions in his private life: around 40 ritual baths or were found in several of his palaces. These were known for being used during this time in Jewish purity rituals in which Jewish people could submerge themselves and purify their bodies without the presence of a priest. There is some speculation as to whether or not these baths were actual as they have also been identified as stepped or Roman cold-water baths; however, several historians have identified these baths as a combination of both types. While it has been proven that Herod showed a great amount of disrespect toward the Jewish religion, scholar Eyal Regev suggests that the presence of these ritual baths shows that Herod found ritual purity important enough in his private life to place a large number of these baths in his palaces despite his several connections to gentiles and pagan cults. These baths also show, Regev continues, that the combination of the Roman and the Jewish suggests that Herod sought some type of combination between the Roman and Jewish cultures, as he enjoyed the purity of Jewish tradition and the comfort of Roman luxury simultaneously.\nHowever, he was also praised for his work, being considered the greatest builder in Jewish history, and one who \"knew his place and followed [the] rules\". What is left of his building ventures are now popular tourist attractions in the Middle East.\nFamily.\nWives and children.\nIt is very probable that Herod had more children, especially with the last wives, and also that he had more daughters, as female births at that time were often not recorded. As polygamy (the practice of having multiple wives at once) was then permitted under Jewish law, Herod's later marriages were almost certainly polygamous.\nFamily trees.\nIn part based on the tree of Rick Swartzentrover.\nMarriages and descendants.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWorks cited.\nSecondary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTertiary sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67762", "revid": "445772", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67762", "title": "Massacre of the Innocents", "text": "Narrative from Christian Bible\nThe Massacre (or Slaughter) of the Innocents is a story recounted in the Nativity narrative of the Gospel of Matthew (\u2013) in which Herod the Great, king of Judea, orders the execution of all male children who are two years old and under in the vicinity of Bethlehem. Most scholars reject the historicity of Matthew\u2019s account of the Massacre of the Innocents, viewing it instead as a theologically motivated narrative modeled on the Exodus story that reflects Herod\u2019s reputation rather than a documented historical event.\nThe Feast of the Holy Innocents, also known as Childermas, is celebrated in the Western Christian Churches on 28 December, the fourth day of Christmastide. In Eastern Christianity, the feast is celebrated on various dates, depending on the denomination.\nBiblical narrative.\nThe Gospel of Matthew tells how the Magi visit Jerusalem to seek guidance as to where the king of the Jews has been born; King Herod directs them to Bethlehem and asks them to return to him and report, but they are warned in a dream that Herod wishes to find the child and kill him, and do not do so. Matthew continues:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;When Herod realized that he had been outwitted by the Magi, he was furious, and he gave orders to kill all the boys in Bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under, in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi.\u2014\u200a\nThis is followed by a reference to and quotation from the Book of Jeremiah () (Jeremiah 31:14 in the Hebrew Bible): \"Then what was said through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled: A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.\" (\u2013). The relevance of this to the massacre is not immediately apparent, as Jeremiah's next verses go on to speak of hope and restoration.\nHistory and theology.\nThe historicity of the Matthew account is not accepted by modern sources. The story of the massacre is found in no gospel other than Matthew, nor is it mentioned in the surviving works of Nicolaus of Damascus (who was a personal friend of Herod the Great), nor in Josephus's \"Antiquities of the Jews\", despite his recording many of Herod's misdeeds, including the murder of three of his own sons. The early 5th-century account of Macrobius\u2014that \"on hearing that the son of Herod, king of the Jews, had been slain when Herod ordered that all boys in Syria under the age of two be killed, [Augustus] said, 'It's better to be Herod's pig than his son'\"\u2014has been discounted as extra-biblical evidence for the event due to its later authorship, possible influence by the gospel narrative, and the confused nature of the account. In view of the lack of independent confirmation that the event occurred, the story acts as a kind of folklore inspired by Herod's reputation. As a matter of understanding what the myth is trying to communicate, its lack of historicity is unsurprising given that gospels were primarily written as theological documents rather than chronological timelines.\nThe author appears to have modeled the episode on the biblical story of Pharaoh's attempt to kill the Israelite children in the Book of Exodus, as told in an expanded version that was current in the 1st century. In that expanded story, Pharaoh kills the Hebrew children after his scribes warn him of the impending birth of the threat to his crown (i.e., Moses), but Moses' father and mother are warned in a dream that the child's life is in danger and act to save him. Later in life, after Moses has to flee, like Jesus, he returns when those who sought his death are themselves dead.\nA few New Testament scholars who are also Christian believers such as biblical literalist Paul L. Maier and the Anglican cleric Richard T. France have offered apologetics in favor of a possible historicity of the account, but these arguments are not accepted by secular scholars. James DG Dunn, while not arguing in favor of historicity, views the massacre story as being an action in line with Herod's known character. Joan E. Taylor and Anthony Le Donne observe that Herod was a vindictive and harsh ruler, and it was common for Jews at the time to face becoming refugees, frequently in Egypt. Taylor argues that the Historical Jesus could indeed have been a refugee whose background shaped his teachings.\nNumbers.\nThe Byzantine Rite liturgy asserts 14,000 Holy Innocents, while an early Syrian list of saints asserts 64,000. Coptic sources assert 144,000 and that it took place on 29 December. Frederick George Holweck's 1910 entry on the subject in the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\" referenced estimates that both assumed the event actually occurred and recognized that Bethlehem was too small a town to provide such numbers, reducing the victims to between 6 and 20 children in the town. France, citing estimates that Bethlehem's population would have been around 1,000 people at the time the event was supposed to occur, concurred with an upper limit of around 20 children killed if it was indeed a historical event.\nIn Christian art.\nMedieval liturgical drama recounted Biblical events, including Herod's slaughter of the innocents. \"The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors\", performed in Coventry, England, included a haunting song about the episode now known as the Coventry Carol. The \"Ordo Rachelis\" tradition of four plays includes the Flight into Egypt, Herod's succession by Archelaus, the return from Egypt, as well as the Massacre, all centered on Rachel weeping in fulfillment of Jeremiah's prophecy. These events were likewise in one of the medieval N-Town Plays.\nThe \"Coventry Carol\" is a Christmas carol dating from the 16th century. The carol was performed in Coventry in England as part of a mystery play called \"The Pageant of the Shearmen and Tailors\". The play depicts the Christmas story from chapter two in the Gospel of Matthew. The carol refers to the Massacre of the Innocents, in which Herod ordered all male infants two years old and under in Bethlehem to be killed. The lyrics of this haunting carol represent a mother's lament for her doomed child. The author is unknown. The oldest known text was written down by Robert Croo in 1534, and the melody dates from 1591. The carol is traditionally sung a cappella.\nThe 17th century Dutch Christmas song \"O Kerstnacht, schoner dan de dagen\", while beginning with a reference to Christmas Night, is about the Massacre of the Innocents. In 1974, the Dutch progressive rock band Focus recorded the first two verses of the song for their album \"Hamburger Concerto\".\nThe theme of the \"Massacre of the Innocents\" has provided artists of many nationalities with opportunities to compose complicated depictions of massed bodies in violent action. It was an alternative to the \"Flight into Egypt\" in cycles of the Life of the Virgin. It decreased in popularity in Gothic art, but revived in the larger works of the Renaissance, when artists took inspiration for their \"Massacres\" from Roman reliefs of the battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs to the extent that they showed the figures heroically nude. The horrific subject matter of the Massacre of the Innocents also provided a comparison of ancient brutalities with the brutalities of the early modern period, during the period of religious wars that followed the Reformation\u00a0\u2013 Bruegel's versions show the soldiers carrying banners with the Habsburg double-headed eagle.\nThe 1590 version by Cornelis van Haarlem also seems to reflect the violence of the Dutch Revolt. Guido Reni's early (1611) \"Massacre of the Innocents\", in an unusual vertical format, is at Bologna. The Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens painted the theme more than once. One version, now in Munich, was engraved and reproduced as a painting as far away as colonial Peru.\nMusic.\nThe communion motet for the Feast of the Holy Innocents is the text from Matthew 2:18 (citing Jeremiah 31:15) \"Vox in Rama\". This was set polyphonically by a number of composers of the renaissance and baroque, including Jacob Clemens non Papa, Giaches de Wert, and Heinrich Sch\u00fctz (in German). \nMarc-Antoine Charpentier composed an oratorio, , H.411, for soloists, chorus, two violins, and continuo (1683\u20131685).\nFeast day.\nDates by denomination.\nToday, the date of Holy Innocents' Day, also called the Feast of the Holy Innocents, or Childermas or Children's Mass, varies.\nBeginnings.\nThe commemoration of the massacre of the Holy Innocents, traditionally regarded as the first Christian martyrs, if unknowingly so, first appears as a feast of the Western church in the Leonine Sacramentary, dating from about 485. The earliest commemorations were connected with the Feast of the Epiphany, 6 January: Prudentius mentions the Innocents in his hymn on the Epiphany. Leo in his homilies on the Epiphany speaks of the Innocents. Fulgentius of Ruspe (6th century) gives a homily (\"On Epiphany, and on the murder of the Innocents and the gifts of the Magi\").\nCatholic medieval traditions.\nFrom the time of Charlemagne, Sicarius of Bethlehem was venerated at Brant\u00f4me, Dordogne as one of the purported victims of the Massacre.\nIn the Middle Ages, especially north of the Alps, the day was a festival of inversion involving role reversal between children and adults such as teachers and priests, with boy bishops presiding over some church services. Bonnie Blackburn and Leofranc Holford-Strevens suggest that this was a Christianized version of the Roman annual feast of the Saturnalia (when even slaves played \"masters\" for a day). In some regions, such as medieval England and France, it was said to be an unlucky day when no new project should be started.\nThere was a medieval custom of refraining where possible from work on the day of the week on which the feast of \"Innocents Day\" had fallen for the whole of the following year until the next Innocents Day. Philippe de Commynes, the minister of King Louis XI of France, tells in his memoirs how the king observed this custom, and describes the trepidation he felt when he had to inform the king of an emergency on the day.\nContemporary traditions in Western Christianity.\nIn denominations of Western Christianity, such as Catholicism and Lutheranism, some Christians attend Mass on Childermas to remember the martyrdom of the Holy Innocents.\nIn England, the memorial is referred to as Childermas or Children's Mass in which \"Children are given a blessing; they sing in the choir and take on other special roles in the church service.\"\nIn Spain, Hispanic America, and the Philippines, 28 December is still a day for pranks, equivalent to April Fool's Day in many countries. Pranks () are also known as and their victims are called ; alternatively, the pranksters are the and the victims should not be angry at them, since they could not have committed any sin. One of the more famous of these traditions is the annual \"Els Enfarinats\" festival of Ibi in Alacant, where the dress up in full military dress and incite a flour fight.\nIn Trinidad and Tobago, Catholic children have their toys blessed at a Mass.\nRoman Rite before and after 1955.\nIn the Roman Rite prior to 1955, a unique feature of this feast was the use of liturgical elements ordinarily ascribed to penitential days\u2014including violet vestments, the omission of the Gloria, and the substitution of a Tract in place of the Alleluia\u2014unless the feast fell on Sunday, in which case the rubrics required the feast to be celebrated as on its octave day, with red vestments, Gloria, and Alleluia. The octave of this feast was suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955, with the feast now celebrated using the features formerly ascribed to its octave day, a practice reinforced by the 1960 Code of Rubrics.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

With a career spanning over five decades, she is known for her roles on stage and screen. Her accolades include two Academy Awards, five Golden Globe Awards, three Primetime Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award, in addition to nominations for a BAFTA Award and a Laurence Olivier Award. Lange is one of few performers to achieve Triple Crown of Acting status.\nLange made her professional film debut in the remake \"King Kong\" (1976) which earned her the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. Lange went on to receive two Academy Awards, her first for Best Supporting Actress as a soap opera star in the comedy \"Tootsie\" (1982) and her second for Best Actress playing a bipolar housewife in the drama \"Blue Sky\" (1994). Her other Oscar-nominated roles were for \"Frances\" (1982), \"Country\" (1984), \"Sweet Dreams\" (1985), and \"Music Box\" (1989). She also acted in films such as \"All That Jazz\" (1979), \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1981), \"Crimes of the Heart\" (1986), \"Cape Fear\" (1991), \"Rob Roy\" (1995), \"Big Fish\" (2003), and \"Broken Flowers\" (2005).\nFor her roles on television she received her first Primetime Emmy Award for her portrayal of Big Edie in the HBO movie \"Grey Gardens\" (2009). Lange gained new recognition by starring in FX's horror anthology, \"American Horror Story\" (2011\u20132014, 2018), which earned her two additional Primetime Emmys for its and . She was Emmy-nominated for her roles as Blanche DuBois in the CBS film \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1995), a wife in the HBO television movie \"Normal\" (2003), and Joan Crawford in FX the miniseries \"Feud: Bette and Joan\" (2017). Lange has also acted in the television films \"O Pioneers!\" (1992), and \"The Great Lillian Hall\" (2024) as well as the Netflix series \"The Politician\" (2019).\nOn stage, Lange made her Broadway debut as Blanche DuBois in the revival of the Tennessee Williams play \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1992). Lange won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her role as Mary Cavan Tyrone in the Broadway revival of the Eugene O'Neill play \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" (2016). Lange returned to Broadway playing the hardheaded matriarch in the Paula Vogel play \"Mother Play\" (2024).\nLange is also a photographer with five published books of photography. She has been a foster parent and holds a Goodwill Ambassador position for UNICEF, specializing in HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Russia.\nEarly life and education.\nJessica Phyllis Lange was born on April 20, 1949, in Cloquet, Minnesota. Her father, Albert John Lange, was a teacher and traveling salesman, and her mother, Dorothy Florence (n\u00e9e Sahlman), was a housewife. She has two older sisters, Jane and Ann, and a younger brother, George. Her paternal ancestry is German and Dutch, her maternal ancestry Finnish. Due to the nature of her father's professions, her family moved more than a dozen times to various towns and cities in Minnesota before settling down in her hometown, where she graduated from Cloquet High School.\nIn 1967, she received a scholarship to study art and photography at the University of Minnesota, where she met and began dating Spanish photographer Paco Grande. After the two married in 1970, Lange dropped out of college to pursue a more bohemian lifestyle, traveling through the United States and Mexico in a microbus with Grande. The pair then moved to Paris, where they drifted apart. While in Paris, Lange studied mime theater under the supervision of \u00c9tienne Decroux and joined the Op\u00e9ra-Comique as a dancer. She later studied acting with Mira Rostova and at HB Studio in New York City.\nCareer.\n1976\u20131989: Breakthrough and acclaim.\nWhile living in Paris, Lange was discovered by fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez and became a model for the Wilhelmina modelling agency. In 1973, she returned to the U.S. and began work in New York City as a waitress at the Lion's Head Tavern in Greenwich Village. While modeling, Lange was discovered by Hollywood producer Dino De Laurentiis, who was looking to cast an ingenue for his remake of \"King Kong\". Lange made her film debut in the 1976 \"King Kong\", beating actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn for the role of \"damsel-in-distress\". Despite the film's success\u00a0\u2013 it was the fifth-highest-grossing film of 1976 and received an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects\u00a0\u2013 it and Lange's performance were widely panned. But film critic Pauline Kael wrote, \"The movie is sparked by Jessica Lange's fast yet dreamy comic style. [She] has the high, wide forehead and clear-eyed transparency of Carole Lombard in \"My Man Godfrey\", [and] one liners so dumb that the audience laughs and moans at the same time, yet they're in character, and when Lange says them she holds the eye and you like her, the way people liked Lombard.\" Lange won the 1976 Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year. She remained a favorite of Kael, who later wrote, \"She has a facial structure that the camera yearns for, and she has talent, too.\"\nAt the close of the decade, Bob Fosse, whom Lange had befriended and with whom she had carried on a casual romantic affair, cast Lange as Angelique, the Angel of Death, a part he had written for her in his semi-autobiographical film \"All That Jazz\" (1979). She was also considered for the role of Wendy Torrance in Stanley Kubrick's horror film \"The Shining\" (1980) before it went to Shelley Duvall.\nLange began the new decade in the light romp \"How to Beat the High Cost of Living\" (1980), co-starring Jane Curtin and Susan Saint James, which received mostly negative reviews and quickly disappeared from theaters. A year later, director Bob Rafelson contacted her about a project he was working on with Jack Nicholson, who had recently auditioned Lange for \"Goin' South\" (1978). Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing summer stock theater and has recounted how he watched her conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided he had found the lead for his film. After meeting Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic film noir \"The Postman Always Rings Twice\" (1981). Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope. The film received mixed reviews, but Lange was highly praised for her performance.\nWhile editing \"The Postman Always Rings Twice,\" Graeme Clifford realized he had found the leading lady for his next film, his first as a director: a biographical film of actress Frances Farmer, whose disillusionment with Hollywood and chaotic family background led her down a tragic path. Filming \"Frances\" (1982), which co-starred Kim Stanley and Sam Shepard, was a grueling experience for Lange, who pored over the screenplay scene by scene, making deep and often taxing connections between her life and Farmer's to tap into the well of emotions the role required. By the end of the shoot, she was physically and mentally spent, and decided to take Stanley's advice to do \"something light,\" which led her to accept a supporting role opposite Dustin Hoffman in Sydney Pollack's \"Tootsie\" (1982).\nIn 1982, Lange became the first performer in 40 years to receive two Academy Award nominations in the same year, for \"Frances\" and for \"Tootsie,\" winning the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her work in the latter, which not only became the second-highest-grossing film of 1982 after Steven Spielberg's \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", it also scored an additional nine Oscar nominations, including one for Best Picture. Her performance in the film also earned her a Golden Globe, along with awards from the National Society of Film Critics, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Lange also won Best Actress at the Moscow International Film Festival for her performance in \"Frances\".\nLange next produced and starred, again opposite Shepard, in 1984's \"Country,\" a topical film depicting a family during the farm crisis. Her performance earned her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations for Best Actress. That same year, she made her television debut as Maggie the Cat, starring opposite Tommy Lee Jones in a CBS \"Playhouse\" production of Tennessee Williams's \"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\". The following year, she testified before the United States Congress on behalf of the Democratic House Task Force on Agriculture, alongside Jane Fonda and Sissy Spacek, whom she later befriended.\nAt the close of 1985, she portrayed legendary country singer Patsy Cline in Karel Reisz's biopic \"Sweet Dreams\", opposite Ed Harris, Ann Wedgeworth, Gary Basaraba, and John Goodman. She was nominated a fourth time for an Oscar and came in second for both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. In several interviews, Meryl Streep has said she \"begged\" Reisz, who directed her in 1981's \"The French Lieutenant's Woman\", for the role of Cline, but his first choice had always been Lange. Streep has been quite vocal and adamant in her praise for Lange's performance, calling her \"beyond wonderful\" in the film and saying, \"I couldn't imagine doing it as well or even coming close to what Jessica did because she was so amazing in it.\" In 2012, on an episode of \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\", Streep once again praised Lange's work in the film, saying, \"Nobody could do that better than [Lange]. I mean, it was divine.\" In 2018, she further commented, \"Jessica did it better than any human being could possibly have done it.\" Streep has also said, \"Every job I've ever taken, about three weeks before I begin, I call up my agent and say, 'I don't think I can do this. I don't think I'm right for it. They should call up Jessica Lange.'\u00a0\"\nLange's films in the mid- to late 1980s, which included \"Crimes of the Heart\" (1986), \"Far North\" (1988), and \"Everybody's All-American\" (1989), were mostly low-profile and underperformed at the box office, though she was often singled out and praised for her work. In 1989, she starred in Costa-Gavras's \"Music Box\" as a Hungarian lawyer defending her father of Nazi war crimes. Her performance earned her a fifth Academy Award nomination and a sixth Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress.\n1990\u20132008: Established actress.\nLange continued making films throughout the 1990s, periodically taking time off to raise her children and do theater- and television-based projects. She began the decade in Paul Brickman's warmly received \"Men Don't Leave\" (1990), for which she earned positive reviews and came in third place for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress. She was then approached by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro, who had both auditioned her for the role of Jake LaMotta's wife in \"Raging Bull\" (1980), to star in a remake of \"Cape Fear\" (1991). The film was the year's 12th- highest-grossing film. In 1992, Lange once again starred opposite De Niro in Irwin Winkler's \"Night and the City\", and in a television adaptation of Willa Cather's \"O Pioneers!\", receiving her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. Lange made her Broadway debut, which met mixed reviews portraying Blanche DuBois in a production of Tennessee Williams's \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" opposite Alec Baldwin. Critics rebuked her performance, with the Boston Globe stating \"Jessica Lange is learning a new craft\u2014theatre\u2014at Blanche\u2019s expense, and ours.\"\nIn 1994, Lange was lauded for her performance as a manic depressive army wife in the 1960s in Tony Richardson's final film, \"Blue Sky\". In 1995, she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this performance, along with the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, the Utah Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress, and the Sant Jordi Award for Best Actress. She also came in second place for the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress, the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress, and the Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress. She became the second actress, after Streep, to follow a Best Supporting Actress Oscar with a Best Actress Oscar, an achievement not repeated until nearly 20 years later by Cate Blanchett. Despite its critical praise, and despite Lange's Oscar-winning performance \"Blue Sky\" was not a box office success.\nIn 1995, Lange gave critically lauded performances in \"Losing Isaiah\", opposite Halle Berry, and \"Rob Roy\", with Liam Neeson. The same year, she reprised her role as Blanche DuBois in a CBS television adaptation of \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", opposite Alec Baldwin, Diane Lane, and John Goodman. She received glowing reviews for her performance, which earned her fourth Golden Globe Award and her first Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie.\nIn 1996, Lange made her London stage debut in another performance as Blanche DuBois, which received rave reviews. The next year, she starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer in a film adaptation of Jane Smiley's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"A Thousand Acres\". Lange received her ninth Golden Globe Award nomination and won the Venice Film Festival's Schermi d'Amore award for her performance in the film. In 1998, she starred opposite Elisabeth Shue in a film adaptation of Balzac's \"Cousin Bette\", for which she received strong reviews. The same year, Lange starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in \"Hush\", which generally received negative reviews, though Roger Ebert praised Lange's performance, writing, \"The film's most intriguing element is the performance by Jessica Lange, who by not going over the top provides Martha with a little pathos to leaven the psychopathology.\"\nLange received strong reviews for her performance in \"Titus\", Julie Taymor's 1999 adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Titus Andronicus\", co-starring Anthony Hopkins and Alan Cumming. \"Entertainment Weekly\" critic Lisa Schwarzbaum included Lange in a \"for your consideration\" article directed at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, writing, \"Jessica Lange already has two Oscars and six nominations to her credit, so her appearance near the words 'Academy Awards' should never be a surprise. But everything about her daring performance in \"Titus\" as Tamora, the Queen of the Goths, is an astonishment. Donning breastplates, vowing vengeance, tearing into Shakespeare for the first time as if nothing could be more fun, Lange steals the show\u00a0\u2013 and when the star of the show is Anthony Hopkins, that's grand theft.\"\nLange began the new millennium with a London stage production of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\", playing the part of the morphine-addicted family matriarch Mary Tyrone, for which she became the first American actress to receive an Olivier Award nomination. She appeared mostly in supporting roles thereafter, most notably opposite Christina Ricci in the 2001 adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's best-selling memoir on depression, \"Prozac Nation\". In 2003, Lange starred opposite Tom Wilkinson in HBO's \"Normal\", a film about a man who reveals to his wife his decision to have a sex change, for which she received nominations for the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Movie. She followed this with performances in the Bob Dylan vehicle \"Masked and Anonymous\" (2003), Tim Burton's \"Big Fish\" (2003), Jim Jarmusch's \"Broken Flowers\" (2005) and Wim Wenders's \"Don't Come Knocking\" (2005), before starring in a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams's \"The Glass Menagerie\" for which she received mixed reviews. She later starred with Tammy Blanchard in a remake of \"Sybil\" in 2007.\n2009\u20132015: Career resurgence.\nIn 2009, Lange co-starred as Big Edie, opposite Drew Barrymore, in HBO's \"Grey Gardens\", directed by Michael Sucsy and based on the 1975 documentary of the same name. The film was a tremendous success, garnering 17 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and winning five. Lange won her first Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie after two previous nominations in the same category. She also received her 11th Golden Globe Award nomination and second Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance, losing both awards to Barrymore.\nIn 2011, Lange joined the cast of FX's horror anthology series \"American Horror Story\". Series co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk originally wrote her part as a supporting character, but after Lange acquired the role, they expanded it. Murphy, a long-time admirer of Lange, said he chose her because he wanted to expose her work to a new generation of viewers. He also singled out her performance as Blanche DuBois on Broadway in 1992, which he saw twice, as his favorite performance, citing it as another motivating factor in hiring Lange. The show was a huge success not only for the network and creators but also for Lange, who experienced a resurgence in her popularity, receiving rave reviews and several awards for her controversial role. She was chosen by \"TV Guide\", \"Entertainment Weekly\", and \"MTV\" for giving one of the \"best performances of 2011\". In addition, she won a second Primetime Emmy Award, a fifth Golden Globe Award, and her first Screen Actors Guild Award, after two previous nominations. She was also awarded a Special Achievement Satellite Award for Outstanding Performance in a Television Series by the International Press Academy and the Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the \"Gay and Lesbian Entertainment Critics Association\" (GALECA). She was further nominated for the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama, Critics' Choice Television Award, and Saturn Award.\nIn 2012, she had a supporting role in her \"Grey Gardens\" director Michael Suscy's box-office hit \"The Vow\", opposite Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams, but also returned to star as the lead in the second season of \"American Horror Story\", titled \"\". Once again, she was chosen by \"TV Guide\" and \"Entertainment Weekly\" for giving one of the \"best performances of 2012\". She won a second Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year by the GALECA, and received a fifth Emmy nomination, a thirteenth Golden Globe Award nomination, a fourth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, a second Saturn Award nomination, and a second Critics' Choice Television Award nomination.\nIn 2013, the third season of \"American Horror Story\", \"\", garnered the series its highest ratings to that point, and has held the record for garnering the series its highest on-average ratings. Lange was joined by fellow film actors Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. For her work on the show, Lange earned a third Primetime Emmy Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries, a third Dorian Award for Best TV Performance of the Year and her first Critic's Choice Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie or Miniseries. She also received her fourteenth Golden Globe nomination, her fifth Screen Actors Guild Award nomination and her fifth Satellite Award nomination for her performance on the series. In addition, Lange replaced Glenn Close in a film adaptation of \u00c9mile Zola's \"Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin\", directed by Charlie Stratton and titled \"In Secret\", co-starring Elizabeth Olsen, Tom Felton, Oscar Isaac, and Matt Lucas for which she received rave reviews.\nLange began 2014 by being honored with a nomination for a star on The Hollywood Walk of Fame, though she has yet to claim it. Lange was also recognized by \"Elle Magazine\" with the L'Oreal de Paris Legend Award presented to her by her friend Shirley MacLaine during \"The Women in Hollywood Awards\", honoring women for their outstanding achievements in film, spanning all aspects of the motion picture industry, including acting, directing, and producing. She was next honored with and became the first female recipient of the Kirk Douglas Award for Excellence in Film, presented to her by the Santa Barbara International Film Festival.\nLater in the year, Marc Jacobs chose Lange to be the new face of Marc Jacobs Beauty. In addition, Lange was featured in the brand's summer and fall print ad campaign photographed by David Sims, and starred in a short campaign film directed by Jacobs. Previously, Jacobs dressed and interviewed Lange for \"Love\" magazine's fifth-anniversary issue, and had her provide a spoken-word version of \"Happy Days Are Here Again\" as the soundtrack for his autumn/winter 2014 show. She next starred opposite Mark Wahlberg in the remake of the 1970s action-thriller, \"The Gambler\", receiving rave reviews for her work. She also led the fourth season of \"American Horror Story\", titled \"\". The series, once again, topped its and the network's highest ratings, breaking all ratings records for both. Though self-admittedly not a singer, Lange's covers of David Bowie's \"Life on Mars\" and Lana Del Rey's \"Gods and Monsters\" for the show were both hugely popular, receiving heavy circulation on YouTube and charting in the top 50 on the iTunes music charts. For her work on the show, Lange received her seventh Primetime Emmy Award nomination, her fifteenth Golden Globe nomination, and her fourth Critics' Choice Television Award nomination. In 2015, Lange announced that she would not return for the series' fifth season. She followed her final season on \"American Horror Story\" with a role opposite Shirley MacLaine and Demi Moore in the road-trip comedy, \"Wild Oats\", which wrapped production at the end of 2014. It premiered on Lifetime on August 22, 2016, before receiving a limited theatrical release on September 16, 2016.\n2016\u2013present: Return to Broadway.\nIn 2016, Lange had a supporting role in Louis C.K.'s critically acclaimed and Peabody Award-winning web series \"Horace and Pete\", which debuted on C.K.'s website on January 30, 2016. C.K. told Howard Stern that he had written the part for Lange and had asked her to be in the series at the Emmy Awards. The series also starred Steve Buscemi, Edie Falco, Alan Alda, and Laurie Metcalf. She next returned to Broadway alongside Michael Shannon, Gabriel Byrne and John Gallagher Jr. in a revival of \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" at the American Airlines Theatre, produced by Ryan Murphy and the Roundabout Theatre Company. Theatre critic Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" wrote of her performance \"You can feel Ms. Lange giving her all to each of her big set pieces, but they often feel too exquisitely self-contained, like coloratura arias in an opera. Ms. Lange is often acting beautifully, but she is also often palpably acting. And her final soliloquy is stretched self-indulgently thin.\" At the 70th Tony Awards the show became the most Tony-nominated play of the season with Lange winning the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. She also won the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award for Best Lead Actress with nominations for the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance and a Time Out New York Award. She told filmmaker Michael Stever that Kim Stanley remained one of her truest inspirations.\nOn November 12, 2016, Lange was honored at the Camerimage Film Festival, where she was awarded the Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski Award for Acting. Lange next starred in FX's anthology series, \"Feud: Bette and Joan\" (2017), also serving as producer alongside Susan Sarandon, who also co-starred, and executive producers Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk. The first season revolved around the infamous rivalry between Hollywood legends Bette Davis (Sarandon) and Joan Crawford (Lange), which came to a head during the making of the classic film, \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?\" (1963). Alfred Molina, Stanley Tucci, Judy Davis and Catherine Zeta-Jones co-starred. Production began in the fall of 2016 and it was released on March 5, 2017.

Lange was also honored by the Trinity Repertory Company's Pell Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Arts on May 23, 2017.\nIn 2018, Lange was honored with the Jason Robards Award for Excellence in Theater by the Roundabout Theater Company. In addition, she starred opposite Gwyneth Paltrow in the Netflix series \"The Politician\" and reprised her role as Constance Langdon in \"\", for which she earned a tenth Emmy nomination\u00a0\u2013 her first in the Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series category\u00a0\u2013 in 2019. Lange's first film of the 2020s was Neil Jordan's \"Marlowe\", based on the novel \"The Black-Eyed Blonde: A Philip Marlowe Novel\" by John Banville and co-starring Liam Neeson and Diane Kruger. The film premiered at the San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival on September 24, 2022. During a press conference at the festival, director Jordan noted, \"I was desperate to work with Jessica Lange. The thought of [her] playing a retired screen goddess was amazing. Thankfully she agreed to play the part.\" The film was released in theaters on December 2, 2022. On June 6, 2023, \"Jessica Lange: An Adventurer's Heart\", a biography by film scholar, historian, and journalist Anthony Uzarowski, was released. \nLange returned to Broadway to originate the lead role in a Second Stage Theater presentation of Paula Vogel's new play, \"Mother Play\", which premiered at the Hayes Theater in April 2024. The production was directed by Tina Landau and co-starred Jim Parsons and Celia Keenan-Bolger. The story takes place in 1962 and centers on Phyllis (Lange), as she oversees her son (Parsons) and daughter's (Keenan-Bolger) relocation to a new apartment, prompting all three to face and reflect on their shared and individual lives and relationships with one another. Alexis Soloski of \"The New York Times\" described the role as a \"showcase for Lange\" adding, \"Another actress as Phyllis might have done more to communicate the small ravages of time, but Lange concentrates instead on her ageless ferocity and charm.\" Lange received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play nomination for the role. \nAlso in 2024, she starred in \"The Great Lillian Hall\", a film directed by Michael Cristofer, written by Elisabeth Seldes Annacone, and co-starring Kathy Bates, Pierce Brosnon, and Lily Rabe. The film, which premiered on HBO on May 31, 2024, centers on Lillian Hall (Lange), a renowned Broadway actress who, while rehearsing for her next Broadway production, \"is forced to reckon with the past and the price she has paid for the choices she made in her life and her art.\" The film was initially set to star Meryl Streep, who backed out of the project for unspecified reasons. The project is loosely based on the acclaimed stage actress Marian Seldes who battled dementia in her later years. Lange earned her sixth Critics' Choice Television Award nomination.\nShe also acted in the FX on Hulu miniseries \"\" (2024) as Truman Capote's deceased mother Lillie Mae Faulk. The series showrunner Jon Rabin Baitz said that casting her was a direct homage to her role as the Angel of Death in the Bob Fosse film \"All That Jazz\" (1979). \nLange will star in director Jonathan Kent's film adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's \"Long Day's Journey into Night\", edited for the screen by David Lindsay-Abaire and co-starring Ed Harris, Ben Foster, and Colin Morgan. In an interview published on November 2, 2022, Lange spoke of her \"bouts with depression\" and \"overwhelming sense of loneliness\" and referred to the aforementioned project, noting, \"I could be feeling that even more acutely right now because I'm starting to play [drug-addicted matriarch] Mary Tyrone again.\" Kent previously directed the 2016 Broadway stage production of O'Neill's play, for which Lange garnered a Tony Award, among other accolades. Additionally, Kenwright produced the 2000 London stage production of O'Neill's play, which earned Lange an Olivier Award nomination, and also produced London stage productions of Tennessee Williams' \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" and \"The Glass Menagerie\", both starring Lange.\nAdditionally, Lange has three other filmed projects in development: a Marlene Dietrich biopic produced by Ryan Murphy for Netflix centered on Dietrich's late-career period in Las Vegas, Gia Coppola's adaptation of Jean Nathan's memoir \"The Search for Dare Wright: The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll\" co-starring Naomi Watts which chronicles the life of Dare Wright and her tempestuous relationship with her mother Edith Stevenson Wright, and a film adaptation of \"The Year of Magical Thinking\" to be filmed in 2025 where she would portray Joan Didion alongside Gary Oldman. Lange will reprise her role in the West End production of Paula Vogel's play, \"Mother Play\" in 2026. Lange has also been confirmed to return for the 13th Season of American Horror Story.\nStyle and reception.\nLange is often included in the milieu of America's most respected actresses.\nIn a career spanning nearly five decades, Lange has come to be associated with playing intelligent women who often have a troubled internal life. She has been credited for her ability to deliver emotional intensity without resorting to excessive melodrama. Critics have frequently pointed out her tendency to play women on the edge of a nervous breakdown, a notion that Lange herself has also acknowledged. Nicholas Bell of \"Ioncinema\" writes that her Oscar-winning role of Carly in \"Blue Sky\" is reminiscent of her signature performances, as \"Lange excels [here] at the small tics hinting at the madness always lurking below the surface\".\nReferring to her acting style, Lange has said that she performs on \"pure emotion\" rather than relying on a specific technique. Director Glenn Jordan, who has directed her in \"O Pioneers!\", noted that \"Jessica reminds me of what someone once said of Jack Lemmon. Whatever emotion or whatever small nuance you want, she is like a supermarket. Her shelves are stocked full and it's all accessible to her\". This sentiment was echoed by actress Sarah Paulson who, after working with Lange on the 2005 stage production of \"The Glass Menagerie\" as well as five seasons of \"American Horror Story\", described the actress as being \"like a cat on a wire\" and added that \"she is very instinctual, she doesn't come up with an entire plan on how to play a scene\". As a result, Lange's performance style has positively been referred to as unpredictable, since she acts out the trajectory of her characters' emotional journey with unexpected turns.\nPersonal life.\nMarriage and relationships.\nLange was married to photographer Francisco \"Paco\" Grande from 1970 to 1982. Though they separated not long after moving to Europe during the mid-1970s, they did not divorce until the early 1980s, after which Lange paid him an undisclosed sum in alimony. According to biographer Anthony Uzarowski, the former couple \"remain close friends.\"\nFrom 1976 to 1982, she was partnered with renowned Russian ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, with whom she had her first child, Aleksandra Lange \"Shura\" Baryshnikov (born 1981). During that time, she was also sporadically linked with Bob Fosse, with whom she remained friends until his death.\nIn 1982, she met and entered a relationship with playwright Sam Shepard. They had two children: daughter Hannah Jane Shepard (born 1986) and son Samuel Walker Shepard (born 1987). They lived together in Virginia, New Mexico, Minnesota, and eventually New York City, before separating in 2009.\nLange often returns to Duluth, Minnesota, and has said of the city, \"It's the one place that has remained constant in my life... After living all over [the world] and traveling everywhere I've wanted to go, I keep coming back here.\"\nActivism and beliefs.\nLange is a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), specializing in the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and in spreading awareness of the disease in Russia. Lange fostered a Romanian child with disabilities during the early 1990s.\nThough she does not adhere to a formal religion, she periodically practices Buddhism, describing it as \"a discipline that makes sense more than anything because it's like a science\". She is also a vegetarian. In September 2013, Lange joined the opposition to Minnesota's wolf hunt and wrote a letter to Governor Mark Dayton.\nHealth issues.\nLange has also revealed that she suffers from severe bouts of depression, once admitting, \"I have never been a believer in psychoanalysis or therapy or anything like that. I've never done that.\" She confessed, \"Though my dark side is dormant right now, it continues to play a big role in whatever capacity I have to be creative. That's the well I'm able to tap into, where all the anguish, rage and sadness are stored.\" In 2022, Lange shed more light on her dark moods, admitting, \"I've suffered bouts of depression my whole life. They ebb and flow. I have a hard time separating the sadness, [and] the depression, from my overwhelming sense of loneliness.\"\nPhotography.\nIn 2008, Lange published a collection of her black-and-white photographs, \"50 Photographs\" (powerHouse Books), with an introduction by Patti Smith. In 2009, an exhibition of her work, along with a series of her films, was presented at the George Eastman House, the oldest international museum of photography and film, which honors distinguished contributions to film with the George Eastman Award. Lange received the first George Eastman Honors Award, an award given to an artist whose life work embodies the traditions and values championed by George Eastman House International Museum of Photography and Film. In 2010, she published a second collection of photographs, \"In Mexico\". In 2013, she released a children's book of photography, \"It's About a Little Bird\". In 2014, she exhibited at Moscow's Multimedia Art Museum. In 2019, she published her fourth book of photography, \"Highway 61\", composed of photographs of U.S. Route 61.\nLange's fifth book of photography \"D\u00e9rive\" was published by powerHouse Books and distributed by Simon &amp; Schuster in 2023.\nActing credits and accolades.\nShe has earned two Academy Awards, three Emmys Awards, and a Tony Award. She has also earned five Golden Globe Awards among sixteen nominations. Along with Helen Mirren, Lange holds the record for most nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film.\nLange has been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) for the following films:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67764", "revid": "211905", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67764", "title": "Northern Dancer", "text": "Canadian-bred Thoroughbred racehorse\nNorthern Dancer (May 27, 1961 \u2013 November 16, 1990) was a Thoroughbred that, in 1964, became the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby. After being retired from racing, he became one of the most successful sires of the 20th century. He is considered a Canadian icon and was inducted into the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame in 1965. Induction into the Racing Hall of Fame in both Canada and the United States followed in 1976. As a competitor, \"The Blood-Horse\" ranked him as one of the top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century. As a sire of sires, his influence on the breed is still felt worldwide.\nAt age two, Northern Dancer was named the Canadian Champion Two-Year-Old Colt after winning both the Summer Stakes and Coronation Futurity in Canada, plus the Remsen Stakes in New York. At three, he became a leading contender for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby, and Blue Grass Stakes. Northern Dancer followed up a record-setting victory in the Kentucky Derby by winning the Preakness Stakes. With a chance at the American Triple Crown, he finished third in the Belmont Stakes. Returning to Canada for a hero's welcome, he won the Queen's Plate in what proved to be his last race.\nNorthern Dancer was retired to stud in 1965 at Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. He was an immediate success when his first crop reached racing age in 1968. The success of his second crop, led by English Triple Crown winner Nijinsky, gave him international renown. Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland branch of Windfields Farm, where he became the most sought sire of his time.\nBackground.\nNorthern Dancer was a bay stallion with a crooked white blaze and three white socks. He was bred in Oshawa, Ontario, by Canadian business magnate Edward P. Taylor, owner of Windfields Farm. He was from the first crop of Nearctic and the first foal out of the mare Natalma, whose sire was Native Dancer.\nAll Thoroughbreds in the Northern Hemisphere have an official birth date of January 1 but Northern Dancer was foaled late in the season, on May 27, 1961. Younger than most of his age cohort, he was only \u00a0hands high when Windfields Farm offered all of its yearlings for sale at its annual auction. Thus, despite a strong pedigree and good conformation, Northern Dancer did not find a buyer at his Can$25,000 reserve price. As a result, Northern Dancer stayed in the Windfields Farm racing stable.\nAt maturity, Northern Dancer had powerful hindquarters along with excellent balance and agility. His stallion listings showed his height as \u00a0hands , but most horsemen who had met him estimated his adult height as between \u00a0hands and \u00a0hands . Shortly before the Kentucky Derby at age three, he weighed . Like his sire Nearctic and grandsire Nearco before him, Northern Dancer had a dominant and sometimes unruly temperament. \"He wasn't mean, but he would wheel and do some tricks\", said Joe Thomas, who later managed the horse's stud career. Trainer Horatio Luro originally wanted to geld the colt because \"he was feisty\", but Taylor refused.\nReferring to the horse's diminutive stature, Sportswriter Jim Murray of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote: \"Northern Dancer is the kind of colt who, if you saw him in your living room, you'd send for a trap and put cheese in it. He's so little, a cat would chase him. But he's so plucky there's barely room in him for his heart. His legs are barely long enough to keep his tail off the ground. He probably takes a hundred more strides than anyone else, but he's harder to pass than a third martini.\"\nRacing career.\n1963: Two-year-old season.\nOn August 2, 1963, Northern Dancer made his debut at Fort Erie Race Track in a maiden race for Canadian foaled two-year-olds over a distance of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;5+1\u20442 furlongs. He was ridden by apprentice jockey Ron Turcotte, who was instructed not to use the whip but gave the colt a tap at the sixteenth pole anyway, whereupon Northern Dancer \"exploded\". He beat seven horses for a purse of $2,100. Turcotte later recalled, \"We won that race by eight lengths. He was a bold horse. Brave. He could handle anything. The grass. The mud. Anything.\"\nWearing blinkers for the first time, Northern Dancer made his next start on August 17 in the Vandal Stakes. Paul Bohenko was his jockey since Turcotte was committed to another horse, Ramblin' Man. Northern Dancer entered into a speed duel at the start of the race, setting up the race for Ramblin' Man to come from behind and win. After the race, Turcotte is quoted as having told Luro, \"the Dancer was definitely the best two year old in Canada, maybe in the world.\" He next entered the Summer Stakes on August 24, then at a distance of 1 mile on the turf at Fort Erie. The track condition was described as 'bog-like', and Northern Dancer is said to have almost fallen. Despite struggling with the ground, he led from the start and hung on for the win.\nAfter a brief layoff, Northern Dancer was entered in the &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u204416 mile Cup and Saucer Stakes on September 28 over the Woodbine turf course, where he was assigned the top weight of 124 pounds. Ron Turcotte was back as his jockey and took him to an early lead, but Northern Dancer tired and fell second to long-shot Grand Garcon by three-quarters of a length. Turcotte believed the horse had still not recovered from the effort in the Summer Stakes and was favouring his left foreleg. \"He kept wanting to bear left, and I couldn't get him on his right lead at all.\"\nOn October 7, he returned in the Bloordale Purse at 1 mile and 70 yards where he was again the top weight at 122 pounds. His main rival Northern Flight carried 117 pounds while other horses carried as little as 112 pounds. Northern Dancer broke well but allowed Northern Flight to take a commanding lead. At the halfway mark, Northern Dancer was third on the rail, 15 lengths back, but gradually closed the gap on the far turn. Down the stretch, the two battled for the lead before Northern Dancer pulled away to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20442 lengths, with the rest of the field some twenty-five plus lengths behind Northern Flight. Five days later, Northern Dancer faced a field of 14 rivals in the Coronation Futurity Stakes, the richest race for Canadian two-year-olds. He settled in fourth at the start, then took over the lead at the halfway point, drawing away to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;6+1\u20444 lengths. It was Turcotte's last ride on Northern Dancer, as Luro feared he could not maintain sufficient control of the headstrong colt. \"God knows how good [Northern Dancer] really was,\" recalled Turcotte, \"for he was never a completely sound horse most of the time I rode him, and I still could not slow him down more than that.\"\nOn November 6, Northern Dancer followed up with a win in the seven-furlong Carleton Stakes at Greenwood on a muddy track. He won by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2+1\u20442 lengths, but the \"Daily Racing Form\" called him an \"unwilling winner\", reflecting heavy pressure from new jockey Jimmy Fitzsimmons, who used the whip throughout the stretch drive. Northern Dancer came back to the barn bleeding from the beginning of a quarter crack. It was thought that the injury was a result of his heavy race schedule \u2013 seven races in three months. Nonetheless, the colt was shipped to Aqueduct Racetrack in New York to compete against American horses. On November 18, he was entered in the Sir Gaylord Purse. He was ridden by Manuel Ycaza, and won by eight lengths over Bupers, who had won the Belmont Futurity. However, the quarter crack became more pronounced, so he was fitted with a bar shoe on his left front hoof to stabilize the foot.\nOn November 27, Northern Dancer was the odds-on favourite in a field of six horses entered in the Remsen Stakes, despite carrying top weight of 124 pounds. Ycaza sent him to the lead early and he won by two lengths in wire-to-wire fashion. His time of 1:35&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 for one mile was a new stakes record. Ycaza later recalled him as an \"ideal horse for any kind of situation. He would do anything you asked.\"\nHis record of seven wins from nine starts earned Northern Dancer the Canadian Juvenile Championship. He was rated at 126 pounds in the Canadian Free Handicap for two-year-olds, five pounds above Ramblin Road. In the American Experimental Free Handicap, he was rated at 123 pounds \u2013 three pounds below champion Raise a Native.\n1964: Three-year-old season.\nAfter the Remsen, Luro gave Northern Dancer some time off to heal and had a vulcanized rubber patch applied to the quarter crack. Northern Dancer recovered quickly and reentered training in January. His first race at three was on February 10, 1964, in a six-furlong prep at Hialeah Park under a new jockey, Bobby Ussery, who was instructed to take it easy and not use the whip. Northern Dancer was bumped at the start and fell to the back of the pack. He recovered and steadily advanced up the rail, only to become trapped behind several horses. He was bumped again and eventually finished third behind Chieftain. Despite the instructions of Luro, Ussury had taken to his whip in the final strides of the race, which led the trainer to publicly criticize the rider. \"I believe in being very patient with my horses,\" said Luro. \"I don't want punishment \u2013 under no circumstances.\"\nOn February 24, Northern Dancer and Chieftain again faced each other in a public workout over seven furlongs at Hialeah. Northern Dancer broke slowly but soon took the lead and won by seven lengths in a time of 1:23&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445. He continued to gallop out past the wire, completing one mile in 1:36&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 and nine furlongs in 1:50&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445. For his next start in the Flamingo Stakes on March 3, Northern Dancer was ridden by Hall of Fame jockey Bill Shoemaker and went off as the even-money favourite in a field of eleven. He settled into second and moved to the lead in the stretch after some gentle urging by Shoemaker, winning by two lengths over Mr. Brick, with Quadrangle a further eight lengths back in third. His time of 1:47&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445 was the second fastest in the history of the race, behind only Bold Ruler's time of 1:47 flat. Shoemaker was pleased with the performance. \"My little horse got a little leg weary in the last sixteenth of a mile,\" he said, \"but that was natural. He wasn't quite so seasoned as some of the other horses.\"\nHe then entered a seven-furlong allowance race at Gulfstream Park on March 28 as a prep for the Florida Derby. Shoemaker was unable to ride due to a previous commitment, so Ycaza got the ride. Northern Dancer won easily by four lengths, equaling the track record of 1:22&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445. In the Florida Derby on April 4, Northern Dancer was the 3\u201310 favourite in a field of eight. With Shoemaker back up, Northern Dancer raced in mid-pack behind a slow pace, then started to make up ground on the rail. Shoemaker waited until the half mile pole then urged the colt on without using the whip. Northern Dancer quickly took the lead at the head of the stretch and then held off a challenge by The Scoundrel, eventually winning by a length. Shoemaker said later that the colt was improving. However, his time was a disappointing 1:50&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445, the slowest Florida Derby since 1955. Joe Hirsch of the \"Daily Racing Form\" commented, \"It did not appear that Shoemaker had a lot of horse left at the wire.\" Luro was satisfied with the performance though, feeling that the slow time of the race was the result of a fast workout a few days earlier in which Northern Dancer had fought restraint by the exercise rider.\nShortly after the race, Luro asked Shoemaker to commit to riding Northern Dancer in the Kentucky Derby. But Shoemaker instead chose Hill Rise, who had won the San Felipe Stakes and the Santa Anita Derby in California. Shoemaker had never ridden Hill Rise but campaigned hard to get the mount, believing the colt represented his best chance for a Derby win. Ycaza was also unable to commit to Northern Dancer as another trainer had first call on his services. Ultimately, Luro settled on Bill Hartack, who had ridden Luro's previous Kentucky Derby winner, Decidedly. \"I'm not upset about it at all,\" said Luro. \"I guess Shoemaker must not have been impressed with my horse's race Saturday, but I believe it was far from his best effort.\"\nWith his new jockey, Northern Dancer was made the 1\u20135 favourite in a field of five in the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland on April 23. With Northern Dancer so heavily backed, only win betting was allowed. Northern Dancer rated in second behind a slow early pace until the head of the stretch when he coasted to the lead. Another horse, Allen Adair, made a run down the stretch so Hartack released his grip and Northern Dancer crossed the finish line in front by half a length. He completed the nine furlongs in a time of 1:49&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20445 and galloped out the Derby distance of ten furlongs in 2:03. Hartack was satisfied with the colt's abilities. \"He is a small horse,\" said Hartack, \"but he has lots of brawn and lots of guts.\"\nBidding for the Triple Crown.\nFor the 1964 Kentucky Derby, run at a distance of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1+1\u20444 miles, Northern Dancer drew post position 7 in a field of 12. He was the second betting choice at odds of 7\u20132 behind Hill Rise at 7\u20135. In the high pressure environment leading up to the race, Luro kept the press away from the colt, even substituting a stable pony for Northern Dancer during photo sessions. Northern Dancer responded by training eagerly, with a final workout of 1:00&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 on April 20. On the day of the race, May 2, Northern Dancer was on edge. As the field reached the track, he \"bounced like a rubber ball\" and gave a huge buck when the band started to play \"My Old Kentucky Home\". He settled during the warm up, only to balk when asked to enter the starting gate. After a few tense moments, Northern Dancer relaxed and loaded quietly. After the break, he settled into good position on the rail around the first turn behind the early pacemakers Mr. Brick and Royal. Down the backstretch, Hartack guided him through a narrow hole into the clear and started to make up ground on the leaders. He got the jump on Hill Rise, who became tangled up in traffic as the front-runners started to fade. With a quarter mile to go, Hartack urged his colt on; Northern Dancer responded by running the next furlong in a very fast 11 seconds. He had a lead of about two lengths, but Hill Rise had gotten in the clear and started to make up ground. Author Kevin Chong later wrote of Northern Dancer's \"short, powerful legs making like a hummingbird's wings\" as he ran down the stretch. Hill Rise closed with giant strides, but Northern Dancer prevailed by a neck in a new race record of two minutes flat that stood until Secretariat broke it in 1973. He became the first Canadian-bred horse to win the Kentucky Derby, making front-page headlines across Canada.\nHartack, known for a somewhat adversarial relationship with the press, was full of praise after the race. \"[Northern Dancer] is a game, hard trying little horse,\" he said. \"He was always in good position and he ran real strong on the turns. He really did some running from the quarter pole to the eighth pole, and he was running his gamest at the wire.\" With the Preakness Stakes being run just two weeks later, Luro was concerned that Northern Dancer would find the race more demanding, especially because the track at Pimlico was deep and taxing. Accordingly, he used long gallops of between two and three miles to build up stamina. Then on the Friday before the race, he \"blew out\" Northern Dancer with a 3-furlong workout in a brisk :35&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;3\u20445 to sharpen his speed.\nFor the Preakness on May 16, Northern Dancer went off as the 2\u20131 second favourite to Hill Rise in a field of six that included the top five finishers from the Derby plus Quadrangle. Northern Dancer settled into third place with Hill Rise tracking just behind. Quadrangle moved to the lead down the backstretch and Northern Dancer started to make his move around the far turn. Hartack had yet to ask Northern Dancer for his run, while the jockeys of both Hill Rise and Quadrangle were working hard to maintain their position. Turning into the stretch, Hartack hit Northern Dancer once and he surged to a commanding lead. Near the finish line, Northern Dancer started to tire but Hartack was not overly worried. \"If he was tired, the horses behind us would be even more tired,\" he explained. Northern Dancer won by two and a half lengths. Hill Rise finished third, caught at the wire by The Scoundrel who claimed second.\nNorthern Dancer celebrated his actual third birthday on May 27 and was presented with a cake of carrots adorned by Canadian flags. He also received hundreds of cards wishing him success in the upcoming Belmont Stakes. Taylor felt that the horse would not mind the distance of 12 furlongs, believing that Hartack would be able to judge the pace and conserve energy. Luro was more worried, believing that Northern Dancer's best distance was between eight and nine furlongs, but hoped the horse's class would be enough to carry him the extra distance.\nWith a Triple Crown at stake, a then-record crowd of 61,215 showed up for the Belmont Stakes on June 6, run that year at Aqueduct due to renovations at Belmont Park. Northern Dancer went off as the 4\u20135 favourite in a field of eight, with Hill Rise the second choice at 2\u20131 and Quadrangle at 13\u20132. With Northern Dancer under a tight hold, he and Hill Rise tracked each other for the first mile behind a slow pace set by outsider Orientalist. Quadrangle was in second, relaxed and saving ground with excellent position on the rail. After a mile in 1:39&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445, Quadrangle's jockey, Manuel Ycaza, made his move, confident his horse had enough stamina to outlast the others. Hartack on Northern Dancer and Shoemaker on Hill Rise appeared to underestimate Quadrangle and did not at first respond, allowing Quadrangle to build a substantial lead into the stretch. When finally asked to run, Northern Dancer closed the gap to within half a length in midstretch. However, he then tired and was passed by Roman Brother to finish third, some six lengths behind the winner. Bill Shoemaker on Hill Rise, who finished fourth, lodged an objection against Hartack for being squeezed off on the final turn but the stewards disallowed the claim. The time of 2:28&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20445 was just two-fifths of a second off the track record. Hartack said he had been worried about several horses, including Quadrangle, before the race and felt the distance was the decisive factor. Asked if he felt disappointed by the result, he replied, \"How can it be a disappointment when a horse runs his heart out for you? He certainly didn't disgrace himself \u2013 not to me, anyway.\"\nReturn to Canada.\nIn spite of the loss in the Belmont, the mayor of Toronto declared June 8, 1964, to be \"Northern Dancer Day\", which included a ceremony held at city hall. (The idea of a ticker-tape parade down Bay Street was nixed due to the colt's high-strung temperament.) E. P. Taylor was presented with a key to the city\u2014carved out of a carrot. Taylor presented the key to Northern Dancer when the horse arrived at Woodbine a few days later; the colt promptly ate it.\nOn June 25, Northern Dancer was the heavy betting favourite in the Queen's Plate at odds of 1\u20137 in a field of eight. He raced from well off the pace, trailing the field around the first turn and still in sixth down the backstretch. Hartack relaxed his hold entering the far turn, and Northern Dancer \"zoomed\" past the early leaders, then drew off to win by &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;7+1\u20442 lengths. Hartack never needed the whip. Northern Dancer completed the race in 2:02&lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20445, which, although more than two seconds off his time in the Kentucky Derby, was just one-fifth of a second off the race record set by Victoria Park in 1960. \"My main concern was with the first turn,\" said Luro after the race. \"You see, we were in the No. 1 post position, and it could have been tough to get around other horses at the turn.\" Accordingly, Hartack had restrained Northern Dancer at the start to avoid traffic problems. However, the colt's poor position made Hartack move sooner than he would have preferred. Despite the easy win, Hartack felt the colt had been somewhat \"dull\", and possibly unsound.\nNorthern Dancer remains the only Kentucky Derby winner to also take the Queen's Plate.\nAftermath.\nNorthern Dancer pulled up lame after a workout at Belmont in July. According to Luro, Northern Dancer had run with a splint on the inside of his left front leg since age two but had never before shown visible evidence of injury. The earlier symptoms of lameness noticed by Turcotte and Hartack had only manifested at full racing speed. Assistant trainer Norman Bowles later said the horse \"would probably run through anything \u2013 he was a tough little man \u2013 and you never can tell when one of those things may start stinging. This time, he had developed a bowed tendon. It did not respond to treatment, and this ended his racing career.\nNorthern Dancer was named the Champion Three-Year-Old Colt of 1964 in the United States. He was also named the three-year-old champion in Canada and Canadian Horse of the Year. In addition, he was named Canadian Athlete of the Year. He was the high weight at 128 pounds on the \"Daily Racing Form\"'s American Free Handicap for three-year-olds, one pound above both Roman Brother and Quadrangle. He was also the high weight at 132 pounds on the Canadian Free Handicap, 12 pounds more than Langcrest.\nIn his two-year racing career, Northern Dancer won 14 of his 18 starts and never finished worse than third. His earnings totaled $580,000, then a record for a Canadian-bred horse. In \"The Blood-Horse\" listing of the top 100 American Thoroughbred racehorses of the 20th century, he was ranked number 43.\nStatistics.\nAn asterisk after the odds means Northern Dancer was the post-time favourite.\nBreeding career.\nNorthern Dancer retired to stud in 1965 at Taylor's Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario, for an initial fee of $10,000. Due to his small size, a ramp was built in the breeding shed to allow Northern Dancer to service mares who were taller than him. He was bred to 35 mares, with 21 live foals being produced in 1966. The first crop reached racing age in 1968 and was an immediate success, including Viceregal, who was named Canadian Horse of the Year. Nine others also became stakes winners, an \"astounding\" 47.6% of the crop. \"His first foals ran so well,\" said Ed Bowen, former editor of \"The Blood-Horse\". \"Northern Dancer had that aura about him right away.\"\nAlthough his second crop produced only four stakes winners, it played a crucial role in his developing reputation. His leading performer was Nijinsky, who was purchased by Irish trainer Vincent O'Brien at the Canadian yearling sale for $84,000. Nijinsky went on to win the 1970 English Triple Crown, the first horse to do so since 1935. Nijinsky was named Horse of the Year in England and Ireland. Meanwhile, Fanfreluche was named Canadian Horse of the Year and co-champion three year-old-filly in both Canada and the United States.\nAs the result of his success, Northern Dancer was relocated to the Maryland division of Windfields Farm in December 1968 and was syndicated in August 1970 for $2.4 million. Taylor retained several shares in the stallion, while other members included Claiborne Farm, Allaire du Pont, Greentree Stud, J. Louis Levesque, Paul Mellon, Spendthrift Farm, Tartan Farm and Alfred G. Vanderbilt. Each share in the syndicate provided an annual breeding right to Northern Dancer, and relatively few other breeding rights were publicly available. As a result of the scarcity of his services and his continued success, Northern Dancer's stud fee rose, slowly at first: from $10,000 (live foal) in 1965, to $15,000 (live foal) in 1969, to $25,000 (live foal) in 1971 to $35,000 ($10,000 of which was non-refundable) in 1975 to $50,000 (no guarantee) in 1978. His published fee, with no guarantee that a live foal would result, then started a rapid increase: $100,000 in 1980, $150,000 in 1981, $250,000 in 1982, $300,000 in 1983 and $500,000 in 1984. For his final years at stud (1985\u20131987), his breeding rights were privately negotiated, with one season selling at auction for $1 million, an amount four to five times that of his closest rivals. By contrast, the highest North American stud fee in 2016 was $300,000 for Tapit.\nNorthern Dancer was one of the 20th century's most successful Thoroughbred sires. From 645 named foals, he sired 411 winners (63.7%) and 147 stakes winners (22.8%). The 147 stakes winners was then a record. He was the 1971 leading sire in North America and also in 1977 when international earnings are included. His progeny were highly sought in Europe, and he became the leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland in 1970, 1978, 1983, and 1984. Most of his progeny resembled him in size and shape: Nijinsky, who stood over \u00a0hands , proved the exception. They were also generally known for their balance and acceleration.\nWhen Northern Dancer was 20 years old (an advanced age for a stallion), his owners turned down an offer of US$40 million from a European syndicate for him. Northern Dancer's entry into stud service was ranked number 28 in \"Horse Racing's Top 100 Moments\", a 2006 review of American racing in the 20th century by \"The Blood-Horse\" magazine.\nNotable progeny.\nNorthern Dancer's major stakes winners include:\n\"c = colt, f = filly, g = gelding\"\nSales records.\nFormer Keeneland chairman Ted Bassett wrote in his autobiography that between 1974 and 1988, the sons and daughters of Northern Dancer fetched the highest prices of all sires at the yearling sales 12 times, \"and that constitutes a record that may last forever.\" Northern Dancer's yearlings also led the Keeneland July Selected Yearling Sale by average price 12 times in the same period. In 1984, 12 yearlings by Northern Dancer sold for an unrivaled sale-record average price of US$3,446,666 (about $ million adjusted for inflation). Combined over a period of 22 years, the top 174 Northern Dancer offspring at the Keeneland Sales sold for a total $160 million. The bidding duels between John Magnier and Robert Sangster of Coolmore Stud and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Darley Stud helped drive up the prices as both sought future breeding prospects.\nThree of the most expensive colts ever sold at public auction were sired by Northern Dancer: Snaafi Dancer, who became the first $10-million yearling when sold to Sheikh Mohammed for $10.2 million in 1983; a colt out of Ballade later named Imperial Falcon, who sold for $8.25 million to Sangster in 1984; and a colt out of Fabuleux Jane later named Jareer, who sold for $7.1 million to Darley Stud. Although none of these three colts was a major winner on the racetrack, the success of other high-priced yearlings like Shareef Dancer (auctioned for $3.3 million), Nureyev (auctioned for $1.3 million) and Lomond (privately sold for 1.5 million) kept demand high.\nEnd of life and burial.\nNorthern Dancer was retired from stud on April 15, 1987, having started to experience heart problems and arthritis. He was pensioned at Windfields Farm in Maryland and when the farm was subsequently sold, a special clause was written to guarantee his lifelong right to live there. On November 15, 1990, at the age of 29, he suffered a severe colic, possibly complicated by a strangulation of his small intestine. Due to his advanced age, it was felt that Northern Dancer would be unable to survive surgery so he was euthanized on November 16. He was loaded in a specially built oak coffin and then wrapped in a blanket he had won during his racing career. That same day, his remains were brought back to Canada in a refrigerated van for burial at Windfields Farm in Oshawa, Ontario.\nWindfields Farm was subsequently sold to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (now Ontario Tech University) and Durham College, and Northern Dancer's burial site was not publicly accessible for many years, at one point becoming covered in weeds. On April 16, 2018, the grave became an official heritage site under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\", with funds presented by the City of Oshawa to landscape the surrounding area.\nLegacy and honours.\nIn 1964, Northern Dancer was the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the Canadian Horse of the Year. In 1965, he became the first horse voted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. In 1976, Northern Dancer was an inaugural inductee to the new Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame and was also inducted into the United States Horse Racing Hall of Fame. In 1977, Northern Dancer won three world sires' premiership titles for the number of international stakes winners, international stakes wins, and total stake earnings of his progeny.\nNorthern Dancer was inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. In 1999, Canada Post honoured the horse with his image placed on a postage stamp. A residential street was named after Northern Dancer on the former site of the Greenwood Race Track in east-end Toronto. Also, a life-sized bronze statue of the horse was placed outside Woodbine Racetrack.\nOver the decades, a number of books have been written about Northern Dancer. In 1995, Muriel Lennox, who had worked for Taylor, published \"Northern Dancer: The Legend and His Legacy\". In 2003, Avalyn Hunter's book \"American Classic Pedigrees (1914\u20132002)\", extensively covered the influence of Northern Dancer on North America classic winners around the end of the 20th century. Her later book, \"The Kingmaker: How Northern Dancer Founded a Racing Dynasty\" covers Northern Dancer's international legacy. In 2015, Kevin Chong wrote \"Northern Dancer: The Legendary Horse That Inspired A Nation\".\nIn 2011, the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame held an induction ceremony that included a 50th-anniversary tribute for Northern Dancer. Saxophone instrumentalist Matthew James performed his tribute song, entitled \"Northern Dancer\". In 2012, Breyer Animal Creations released a portrait model of Northern Dancer sculpted by Jeanne Mellin Herrick. In 2014, the Canadian Film Centre unveiled the Northern Dancer Pavilion on its Windfields Farms heritage campus. In 2018, the city of Oshawa announced that a new elementary school, located near what used to be Windfields Farm at the corner of Northern Dancer Drive and Bridle Road, would be named after the horse. Northern Dancer's Kentucky Derby trophy is on permanent exhibit at the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Qu\u00e9bec.\nSire of sires.\nIn 1990, \"The New York Times\" called Northern Dancer \"the dominant progenitor of his breed\" because his own success at stud was amplified by the impact of his sons around the world. His leading sire sons included:\nNorthern Dancer's impact continues well into the 21st century. In North America, 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify has multiple crosses to Northern Dancer, in the direct male line through Storm Cat, and also through Nijinsky and Vice Regent. American Pharoah, winner of the 2015 Triple Crown is 5 \u00d7 5 inbred to Northern Dancer, through Storm Bird and El Gran Senor. California Chrome, winner of the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, is inbred 4 \u00d7 5 to Northern Dancer on his dam's side. Northern Dancer appears at least once in the pedigree of every contestant in the 2018 Kentucky Derby.\nMore Northern Dancer-descended horses are Breeders' Cup winners than from any other horse. According to pedigree consultant John Sparkman, 35 to 40 percent of American graded stakes winners of 2013 were male line descendants of Northern Dancer. In Europe and Australia, the percentage is well over 60 per cent.\nIn Europe, Northern Dancer's bloodline is pervasive. Northern Dancer was a four-time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland, a feat achieved one time each by his sons Be My Guest and Nijinsky, 14 times by his son Sadler's Wells, two times by his grandson Caerleon, three times by his grandson Danehill, and twelve times (as of 2021) by his grandson Galileo \u2013 a total of 36 champion sire titles in just the direct Northern Dancer to grandson bloodline. Adding his great-grandsons Danehill Dancer, who was the leading sire in 2009, and Frankel (2021) the Northern Dancer sire line accounted for every champion sire title in Great Britain and Ireland from 1990 to 2021 inclusive.\nHe is the paternal grand-sire of a record 29 different English Classic winners \u2014 the next closest in this regard is St. Simon with 23. As for the Epsom Derby, a 2011 study showed that every winner since 1998 had Northern Dancer in his pedigree. The Northern Dancer sire line has accounted for 28 Derby winners as of 2019[ [update]]. Galileo, High Chaparral, Motivator, New Approach, Sea the Stars, Camelot, Australia, and Golden Horn are included in this number.\nInbreeding.\nBecause of the prevalence of Northern Dancer's bloodline, a certain degree of inbreeding to him is becoming common. Whenever this happens, there is a concern that the inbreeding will weaken the breed, making horses more prone to injury and potentially leading to inbreeding depression. Statistical studies have shown that inbreeding has increased by a small but significant amount in the last 50 years, partly because of the larger number of foals that a successful stallion will now sire each year compared to in the past. For example, Northern Dancer sired 645 foals in 20 years at stud, whereas his grandson Danehill sired 2,499 foals in 14 years at stud.\nStatistical analysis has shown that inbreeding to Northern Dancer is on average slightly \"less\" effective than when stallions of his line are bred to mares who do not have Northern Dancer in their pedigree (referred to as an outcross). However, many successful stallions are inbred, in part because this can make it easier to pass on dominant characteristics. Notable sires that are inbred to Northern Dancer (within four generations) include Oasis Dream, Rock of Gibraltar, Hernando, Spinning World, Redoute's Choice, and Frankel.\nNorthern Dancer lines were originally outcrossed on descendants of Mr. Prospector or Nasrullah, but this became so common that it is increasingly difficult to find horses from these lines who do not also carry Northern Dancer breeding. Outcross bloodlines can still be found, most notably through Sunday Silence and the German-bred stallion Monsun.\nIn North America, Northern Dancer is farther back in the pedigree of most major sires, decreasing the risks associated with inbreeding. For example, Tapit, the leading sire in North America from 2014 to 2016, is inbred 3 \u00d7 5 to Nijinsky II (thus 4 \u00d7 6 to Northern Dancer). He has crossed well with mares from other Northern Dancer lines.\nPedigree.\nNorthern Dancer was by Nearctic, who in turn was sired by Nearco, an Italian-bred horse who was undefeated in fourteen starts. Retired to stud in England, Nearco was considered a \"breed-shaping\" sire of sires. In 1952, Taylor attended the Newmarket December sale in England, where he purchased Lady Angela, a daughter of leading sire Hyperion. In 1953, Taylor had Lady Angela bred to Nearco before shipping her to Canada, where she foaled Nearctic in early 1954. Nearctic was Canadian Horse of the Year in 1958, a feat that Northern Dancer matched in 1964.\nNorthern Dancer's broodmare sire (maternal grandsire) was Native Dancer, who also was an important sire of sires, chiefly through Raise A Native and Mr. Prospector. Northern Dancer was thus an immediate descendant of three of the most important bloodlines of the middle twentieth century (Nearco, Hyperion and Native Dancer).\nHis female family is equally distinguished, if not as well-known. Northern Dancer's dam Natalma was a stakes-placed mare who was disqualified from a win in the Spinaway Stakes. She developed a knee chip in June 1960 and Taylor decided to breed her to Nearctic in his first year at stud rather than keep her in training. Northern Dancer, a late foal on May 27, 1961, was the result. Natalma established herself as a \"blue hen\", producing not only Northern Dancer but three other stakes winners. Her daughters have further extended the family: Arctic Dancer, a full sister of Northern Dancer, became the dam of La Prevoyante, 1972 Canadian Horse of the Year; Spring Adieu became the second dam of leading international sire Danehill (who is inbred to Natalma as he is also a grandson of Northern Dancer); and Raise the Standard is the granddam of important European sire Machiavellian.\nNatalma's dam Almahmoud produced several other influential daughters including Cosmah, who produced four stakes winners including Tosmah (three-time American champion filly) and Halo, who would go on to sire Sunday Silence. Another daughter of Almahmoud, Bubbling Beauty, produced Arctic Tern, the French champion sire of 1986.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As head of the Jewish Agency from 1935, and later president of the Jewish Agency Executive, he was the \"de facto\" leader of the Jewish community in Palestine, and largely led the movement for an independent Jewish state in Mandatory Palestine.\nBorn in P\u0142o\u0144sk, then part of Congress Poland, to Polish Jewish parents, he immigrated to the Palestine region of the Ottoman Empire in 1906. Adopting the name of Ben-Gurion in 1909, he rose to become the preeminent leader of the Jewish community in British-ruled Mandatory Palestine from 1935 until the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, which he led until 1963 with a short break in 1954\u201355. Ben-Gurion's interest for Zionism developed early in his life, leading him to become a major Zionist leader, and the executive head of the World Zionist Organization in 1946.\nOn 14 May 1948, he formally proclaimed the establishment of Israel, and was the first to sign the Israeli Declaration of Independence, which he had helped to write. Under Ben-Gurion's leadership, the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War saw the uniting of the various Jewish militias into the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the victory of Israel over the Arab League, and the expulsion and flight of a majority of the Palestinian Arab population. Subsequently, he became known as \"Israel's founding father\". Following the war, Ben-Gurion served as Israel's first prime minister and minister of defence. As prime minister, he helped build state institutions, presiding over national projects aimed at the development of the country. He also oversaw the absorption of Jewish immigrants. A major part of his foreign policy was improving relations with West Germany through a reparations agreement in compensation for Nazi confiscation of Jewish property during the Holocaust.\nIn 1954, he resigned as prime minister and minister of defence but remained a member of the Knesset. He returned as minister of defence in 1955 after the Lavon Affair and the resignation of Pinhas Lavon. Later that year he became prime minister again, following the 1955 elections. He backed Israel's reprisal operations to Arab guerrilla attacks and its invasion of Egypt, along with Britain and France, during the Suez Crisis in 1956. He stepped down from office in 1963, and retired from political life in 1970. He then moved to his modest \"hut\" in Sde Boker, a kibbutz in the Negev desert, where he lived until his death. Posthumously, Ben-Gurion was named one of \"Time\" magazine's .\nEarly life.\nChildhood and education.\nDavid Ben-Gurion was born in P\u0142o\u0144sk in Congress Poland\u2014then part of the Russian Empire, to Polish Jewish parents. His father, Avigdor Gr\u00fcn, was a \"pok\u0105tny doradca\" (secret adviser), navigating his clients through the often corrupt Imperial legal system. Following the publication of Theodore Herzl's \"Der Judenstaat\" in 1896 Avigdor co-founded a Zionist group called \"Beni Zion\"\u2014Children of Zion. In 1900 it had a membership of 200. David was the youngest of three boys with an older and younger sister. His mother, Scheindel (Broitman), died of sepsis following a stillbirth in 1897. It was her eleventh pregnancy. Two years later his father remarried. Ben-Gurion's birth certificate, found in Poland in 2003, indicated that he had a twin brother who died shortly after birth. Between the ages of five and 13 Ben-Gurion attended five different heders as well as compulsory Russian classes. Two of the heders were 'modern' and taught in Hebrew rather than Yiddish. His father could not afford to enrol Ben-Gurion in P\u0142o\u0144sk's beth midrash so Ben-Gurion's formal education ended after his bar mitzvah. At the age of 14 he and two friends formed a youth club, \"Ezra\", promoting Hebrew studies and emigration to the Holy Land. The group ran Hebrew classes for local youth and in 1903 collected funds for the victims of the Kishinev pogrom. One biographer writes that \"Ezra\" had 150 members within a year. A different source estimates the group never had more than \"several dozen\" members.\nIn 1904 Ben-Gurion moved to Warsaw where he hoped to enrol in the Warsaw Mechanical-Technical School founded by Hipolit Wawelberg. He did not have sufficient qualifications to matriculate and took work teaching Hebrew in a Warsaw heder. Inspired by Tolstoy he had become a vegetarian. He became involved in Zionist politics and in October 1905 he joined the clandestine Social-Democratic Jewish Workers' Party\u2014\"Poalei Zion\". Two months later he was the delegate from P\u0142o\u0144sk at a local conference. While in Warsaw the Russian Revolution of 1905 broke out and he was in the city during the clampdown that followed; he was arrested twice, the second time he was held for two weeks and only released with the help of his father. In December 1905 he returned to P\u0142o\u0144sk as a full-time Poalei Zion operative. There he worked to oppose the anti-Zionist Bund who were trying to establish a base. He also organised a strike over working conditions amongst garment workers. He was known to use intimidatory tactics, such as extorting money from wealthy Jews at gunpoint to raise funds for Jewish workers.\nBen-Gurion discussed his hometown in his memoirs, saying:\nFor many of us, anti-Semitic feeling had little to do with our dedication [to Zionism]. I personally never suffered anti-Semitic persecution. P\u0142o\u0144sk was remarkably free of it ... Nevertheless, and I think this very significant, it was P\u0142o\u0144sk that sent the highest proportion of Jews to Eretz Israel from any town in Poland of comparable size. We emigrated not for negative reasons of escape but for the positive purpose of rebuilding a homeland ... Life in P\u0142o\u0144sk was peaceful enough. There were three main communities: Russians, Jews and Poles. ... The number of Jews and Poles in the city were roughly equal, about five thousand each. The Jews, however, formed a compact, centralized group occupying the innermost districts whilst the Poles were more scattered, living in outlying areas and shading off into the peasantry. Consequently, when a gang of Jewish boys met a Polish gang the latter would almost inevitably represent a single suburb and thus be poorer in fighting potential than the Jews who even if their numbers were initially fewer could quickly call on reinforcements from the entire quarter. Far from being afraid of them, they were rather afraid of us. In general, however, relations were amicable, though distant.\nIn autumn of 1906 he left Poland to go to Palestine. He travelled with his sweetheart, Rachel Nelkin, and her mother, as well as Shlomo Zemach, his comrade from \"Ezra\". His voyage was funded by his father.\nOttoman Empire and Constantinople.\nImmediately on landing in Jaffa, 7 September 1906, Ben-Gurion set off, on foot, in a group of 14, to Petah Tikva. It was the largest of the 13 Jewish agricultural settlements and consisted of 80 households with a population of nearly 1,500; of these around 200 were Second Aliyah pioneers like Ben-Gurion. He found work as a day labourer, waiting each morning hoping to be chosen by an overseer. Jewish workers found it difficult competing with local villagers who were more skilled and prepared to work for less. Ben-Gurion was shocked at the number of Arabs employed. In November he caught malaria and the doctor advised he return to Europe. By the time he left Petah Tikva in summer of 1907 he had worked an average 10 days a month which frequently left him with no money for food. He wrote long letters in Hebrew to his father and friends. They rarely revealed how difficult life was. Others who had come from P\u0142o\u0144sk were writing about tuberculosis, cholera and people dying of hunger.\nOn his disembarkation at Jaffa, Ben-Gurion had been spotted by Israel Shochat who had arrived two years previously and had established a group of around 25 Poale Zion followers. Shochat made a point of inspecting new arrivals looking for recruits. A month after his arrival at Petah Tikva, Shochat invited Ben-Gurion to attend the founding conference of the Jewish Social Democratic Workers' Party in the Land of Israel in Jaffa. The conference, 4\u20136 October 1906, was attended by 60 or so people. Shochat engineered the elections so that Ben-Gurion was elected onto the five-man Central Committee and the 10-man Manifesto Committee. He also arranged that Ben-Gurion was chosen as chairman of the sessions. These Ben-Gurion conducted in Hebrew, forbidding the translation of his address into Russian or Yiddish. The conference was divided: a large faction\u2014\"Rostovians\"\u2014wanted to create a single Arab\u2013Jewish proletariat. This Shochat and Ben-Gurion opposed. The conference delegated the Manifesto Committee the task of deciding the new party's objectives. They produced \"The Ramleh Programme\" which was approved by a second smaller 15-man conference held in Jaffa the following January 1907. The programme stated \"the party aspires to political independence of the Jewish People in this country.\" All activities were to be conducted in Hebrew; there should be segregation of the Jewish and the Arab economies; and a Jewish trade union was to be established. Three members of the Central Committee resigned and Ben-Gurion and Shochat continued meeting weekly in Jaffa or Ben Shemen where Shochat was working. Ben-Gurion walked to the meetings from Petah Tikva until he moved to Jaffa where he gave occasional Hebrew lessons. His political activity resulted in the establishment of three small trade unions amongst some tailors, carpenters and shoemakers. He set up the \"Jaffa Professional Trade Union Alliance\" with 75 members. He and Shochat also brokered a settlement to a strike at the Rishon Le Zion winery where six workers had been sacked. After three months the two-man Central Committee was dissolved, partly because, at that time, Ben-Gurion was less militant than Shochat and the Rostovians. Ben-Gurion returned to Petah Tikva.\nDuring this time Ben-Gurion sent a letter to \"Yiddish Kemfer\" (\"\"The Jewish Fighter\"\"), a Yiddish newspaper in New York City. It was an appeal for funds and was the first time something written by Ben-Gurion was published.\nThe arrival of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi in April 1907 revitalised the local Poale Zion. Eighty followers attended a conference in May at which Ben-Zvi was elected onto a two-man Central Committee and all Ben-Gurion's policies were reversed: Yiddish, not Hebrew, was the language to be used; the future lay with a united Jewish and Arab proletariat. Further disappointment came when Ben-Zvi and Shochat were elected as representatives to go to the World Zionist Congress. Ben-Gurion came last of five candidates. He was not aware that at the next gathering, on Ben-Zvi's return, a secret para-military group was set up\u2014Bar-Giora\u2014under Shochat's leadership. Distancing himself from Poale Zion activism Ben-Gurion, who had been a day-labourer at Kfar Saba, moved to Rishon Lezion where he remained for two months. He made detailed plans with which he tried to entice his father to come and be a farmer.\nIn October 1907, on Shlomo Zemach's suggestion, Ben-Gurion moved to Sejera. An agricultural training farm had been established at Sejera in the 1880s and since then a number of family-owned farms, moshavah, had been established forming a community of around 200 Jews. It was one of the most remote colonies in the foothills of north-eastern Galilee. It took the two young men three days to walk there. Coincidentally at the same time Bar Giora, now with about 20 members and calling themselves 'the collective' but still led by Shochat, took on the operating of the training farm. Ben-Gurion found work in the farm but, excluded from 'the collective', he later became a labourer for one of the moshav families. One of the first acts of 'the collective' was organising sacking of the farm's Circassian nightwatchman. As a result, shots were fired at the farms every night for several months. Guns were brought and the workforce armed. Ben-Gurion took turns patrolling the farm at night.\nIn the autumn of 1908 Ben-Gurion returned to P\u0142o\u0144sk to be conscripted into the army and avoid his father facing a heavy fine. He immediately deserted and returned to Sejera, travelling, via Germany, with forged papers.\nOn 12 April 1909 two Jews from Sejera were killed in clashes with local Arabs following the death of a villager from Kfar Kanna, shot in an attempted robbery. There is little conformation of Ben-Gurion's accounts of his part in this event.\nLater that summer, Ben-Gurion moved to Zichron Yaakov. From where the following spring he was invited, by Ben-Zvi, to join the staff of Poale Zion's new Hebrew periodical, Ha'ahdut (The Unity), which was being established in Jerusalem. They needed his fluency in Hebrew for translating and proof reading. It was the end of his career as a farm labourer. The first three editions came out monthly with an initial run of 1000 copies. It then became a weekly with a print run of 450 copies. He contributed 15 articles over the first year, using various pen names, eventually settling for Ben Gurion. The adopting of Hebrew names was common amongst those who remained during the Second Aliyah. He chose Ben-Gurion after the historic Joseph ben Gurion.\nIn the spring of 1911, faced with the collapse of the Second Aliyah, Poale Zion's leadership decided the future lay in \"Ottomanisation\". Ben-Zvi, Manya and Israel Shochat announced their intention to move to Istanbul. Ben-Zvi and Shochat planned to study law at Istanbul University; Ben-Gurion was to join them but first needed to learn Turkish, spending eight months in Salonika, at that time the most advanced Jewish community in the area. Whilst studying he had to conceal that he was Ashkenazi due to local Sephardic prejudices. Ben-Zvi obtained a forged secondary school certificate so Ben-Gurion could join him in Dar al-Funun. Ben-Gurion was entirely dependent on funding from his father, while Ben-Zvi found work teaching. Struggling with ill health, Ben-Gurion spent some time in hospital.\nBen-Gurion in America, 1915\u20131918.\nBen-Gurion was at sea, returning from Istanbul, when the First World War broke out. He was not amongst the thousands of foreign nationals deported in December 1914. Based in Jerusalem, he and Ben-Zvi recruited forty Jews into a Jewish militia to assist the Ottoman Army. Despite his pro-Ottoman declarations he was deported to Egypt in March 1915. From there he made his way to the United States, arriving in May. For the next four months Ben-Gurion and Ben Zvi embarked on a speaking tour planned to visit Poale Zion groups in 35 cities in an attempt to raise a pioneer army, Hechalutz, of 10,000 men to fight on the Ottoman side. The tour was a disappointment. Audiences were small; Poale Zion had fewer than 3,000 members, mostly in the New York area. Ben-Gurion was hospitalised with diphtheria for two weeks and spoke on only five occasions and was poorly received. Ben-Zvi spoke to 14 groups as well as an event in New York City and succeeded in recruiting 44 volunteers for Hechalutz; Ben-Gurion recruited 19. Ben-Gurion embarked on a second tour in December, speaking at 19 meetings, mostly in small towns with larger events in Minneapolis and Galveston. Due to the lack of awareness of Poale Zion's activities in Palestine it was decided to republish \"Yizkor\" in Yiddish. The Hebrew original was published in Jaffa in 1911; it consisted of eulogies to Zionist martyrs and included an account by Ben-Gurion of his Petah Tikva and Sejera experiences. The first edition appeared in February 1916 and was an immediate success; all 3,500 copies were sold. A second edition of 16,000 was published in August. Martin Buber wrote the introduction to the 1918 German edition. The follow-up was conceived as an anthology of work from Poale Zion leaders; in fact Ben-Gurion took over as editor, writing the introduction and two-thirds of the text. He suspended all his Poale Zion activities and spent most of the next 18 months in New York Public Library. Ben-Zvi, originally designated as co-editor, contributed a section on Jewish history in which he expounded the theory that the fellahin currently living in the area were descendants of pre-Roman conquest Jews. \"Eretz Israel \u2013 Past and Present\" was published in April 1918. It cost $2 and was 500 pages long, over twice the length of \"Yizkor\". It was an immediate success, selling 7,000 copies in 4 months; second and third editions were printed. Total sales of 25,000 copies made a profit of $20,000 for Poale Zion. It made Ben-Gurion the most prominent Poale Zion leader in America.\nIn May 1918 Ben-Gurion joined the newly formed Jewish Legion of the British Army and trained at Fort Edward in Windsor, Nova Scotia. He volunteered for the 38th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, one of the four which constituted the Jewish Legion. His unit fought against the Ottomans as part of Chaytor's Force during the Palestine Campaign, though he remained in a Cairo hospital with dysentery. In 1918, after a period of guarding prisoners of war in the Egyptian desert, his battalion was transferred to Sarafand. On 13 December 1918 he was demoted from corporal to private, fined three days' pay and transferred to the lowest company in the battalion. He had been five days absent without leave visiting friends in Jaffa. He was demobilised in early 1919.\nMarriage and family.\nOne of Ben-Gurion's companions when he made the Aliyah was Rachel Nelkin. Her stepfather, Reb Simcha Isaac, was the leading Zionist in P\u0142o\u0144sk, and they had met three years previously at one of his meetings. It was expected that their relationship would continue when they landed in Jaffa but he shut her out after she was fired on her first day labouring\u2014manuring the citrus groves of Petah Tikva.\nWhilst in New York City in 1915, he met Russian-born Paula Munweis and they married in 1917. In November 1919, after an 18-month separation, Paula and their daughter Geula joined Ben-Gurion in Jaffa. It was the first time he met his one-year-old daughter. The couple had three children: a son, Amos, and two daughters, Geula Ben-Eliezer and Renana Leshem. Amos married Mary Callow, already pregnant with their first child. She was an Irish gentile, and although Reform rabbi Joachim Prinz converted her to Judaism soon after, neither the Palestine rabbinate nor her mother-in-law Paula Ben-Gurion considered her a real Jew until she underwent an Orthodox conversion many years later. Amos became Deputy Inspector-General of the Israel Police, and also the director-general of a textile factory. He and Mary had six granddaughters from their two daughters and a son, Alon, who married a Greek gentile. Geula had two sons and a daughter, and Renana, who worked as a microbiologist at the Israel Institute for Biological Research, had a son.\nZionist leadership between 1919 and 1948.\nAfter the death of theorist Ber Borochov, the left-wing and centrist factions of Poalei Zion split in February 1919, with Ben-Gurion and his friend Berl Katznelson leading the centrist faction of the Labor Zionist movement. The moderate Poalei Zion formed Ahdut HaAvoda with Ben-Gurion as leader in March 1919.\nIn 1920 he assisted in the formation of the Histadrut, the Zionist Labor Federation in Palestine, and served as its general secretary from 1921 until 1935. At Ahdut HaAvoda's 3rd Congress, held in 1924 at Ein Harod, Shlomo Kaplansky, a veteran leader from Poalei Zion, proposed that the party should support the British Mandatory authorities' plans for setting up an elected legislative council in Palestine. He argued that a Parliament, even with an Arab majority, was the way forward. Ben-Gurion, already emerging as the leader of the Yishuv, succeeded in getting Kaplansky's ideas rejected.\nIn 1930, Hapoel Hatzair (founded by A. D. Gordon in 1905) and Ahdut HaAvoda joined forces to create Mapai, the more moderate Zionist labour party (it was still a left-wing organisation, but not as far-left as other factions) under Ben-Gurion's leadership. In the 1940s the left-wing of Mapai broke away to form Mapam. Labor Zionism became the dominant tendency in the World Zionist Organization and in 1935 Ben-Gurion became chairman of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency, a role he kept until the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.\nDuring the 1936\u20131939 Arab revolt in Palestine, Ben-Gurion instigated a policy of restraint (\"Havlagah\") in which the Haganah and other Jewish groups did not retaliate for Arab attacks against Jewish civilians, concentrating only on self-defense. In 1937, the Peel Commission recommended partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab areas and Ben-Gurion supported this policy. This led to conflict with Ze'ev Jabotinsky who opposed partition and as a result Jabotinsky's supporters split with the Haganah and abandoned Havlagah.\nThe house where he lived from 1931 on, and for part of each year after 1953, is now a historic house museum in Tel Aviv, the \"Ben-Gurion House\". He also lived in London for some months in 1941.\nIn 1946, Ben-Gurion and North Vietnam's Politburo chairman Ho Chi Minh became very friendly when they stayed at the same hotel in Paris. Ho Chi Minh offered Ben-Gurion a Jewish home-in-exile in Vietnam. Ben-Gurion declined, telling Ho Chi Minh: \"I am certain we shall be able to establish a Jewish Government in Palestine.\"\nViews and opinions.\nLeninist views.\nAccording to his biographer Tom Segev, Ben-Gurion deeply admired Lenin and intended to be a 'Zionist Lenin'. In \"Ben-Gurion: A Political Life\" by Shimon Peres and David Landau, Peres recalls his first meeting with Ben-Gurion as a young activist in the No'ar Ha'Oved youth movement. Ben-Gurion gave him a lift, and out of the blue told him why he preferred Lenin to Trotsky: \"Lenin was Trotsky's inferior in terms of intellect\", but Lenin, unlike Trotsky, \"was decisive\". When confronted with a dilemma, Trotsky would do what Ben-Gurion despised about the old-style diaspora Jews: he manoeuvred; as opposed to Lenin, who would cut the Gordian knot, accepting losses while focusing on the essentials. In Peres' opinion, the essence of Ben-Gurion's life work were \"the decisions he made at critical junctures in Israel's history\", and none was as important as the acceptance of the 1947 partition plan, a painful compromise which gave the emerging Jewish state little more than a fighting chance, but which, according to Peres, enabled the establishment of the State of Israel.\n1937 letter.\nThe 1937 Ben-Gurion letter was written when he was head of the executive committee of the Jewish Agency, to his son Amos on 5 October 1937. The letter is well known to scholars as it provides insight into Ben-Gurion's reaction to the report of the Peel Commission released on 7 July of the same year. It has also been subject to significant debate by scholars as a result of scribbled-out text that may or may not provide written evidence of an intention to \"expel the Arabs\" or \"not expel the Arabs\" depending on one's interpretation of whether such deletion was intended by Ben-Gurion.\nRole in 1948 exodus of Palestinians.\nIsraeli historian Benny Morris wrote that the idea of expulsion of Palestinian Arabs was endorsed in practice by mainstream Zionist leaders, particularly Ben-Gurion. He did not give clear or written orders in that regard, but Morris claims that Ben-Gurion's subordinates understood his policy well:\nViews on Arab relations and coexistence.\nBen-Gurion published two volumes setting out his views on relations between Zionists and the Arab world: \"We and Our Neighbors\", published in 1931, and \"My Talks with Arab Leaders\" published in 1967. Ben-Gurion believed in the equal rights of Arabs who remained in and would become citizens of Israel. He was quoted as saying, \"We must start working in Jaffa. Jaffa must employ Arab workers. And there is a question of their wages. I believe that they should receive the same wage as a Jewish worker. An Arab has also the right to be elected president of the state, should he be elected by all.\"\nBen-Gurion recognised the strong attachment of Palestinian Arabs to the land. In an address to the United Nations on 2 October 1947, he doubted the likelihood of peace:\nThis is our native land; it is not as birds of passage that we return to it. But it is situated in an area engulfed by Arabic-speaking people, mainly followers of Islam. Now, if ever, we must do more than make peace with them; we must achieve collaboration and alliance on equal terms. Remember what Arab delegations from Palestine and its neighbors say in the General Assembly and in other places: talk of Arab-Jewish amity sound fantastic, for the Arabs do not wish it, they will not sit at the same table with us, they want to treat us as they do the Jews of Bagdad, Cairo, and Damascus.\nNahum Goldmann criticised Ben-Gurion for what he viewed as a confrontational approach to the Arab world. Goldmann wrote, \"Ben-Gurion is the man principally responsible for the anti-Arab policy, because it was he who molded the thinking of generations of Israelis.\" Simha Flapan quoted Ben-Gurion as stating in 1938: \"I believe in our power, in our power which will grow, and if it will grow agreement will come...\"\nGoldmann reported that Ben Gurion had told him in private in 1956:\nIn 1909, Ben-Gurion attempted to learn Arabic but gave up. He later became fluent in Turkish. The only other languages he was able to use when in discussions with Arab leaders were English, and to a lesser extent, French.\nStances on British\u00a0rule.\nThe British 1939 White paper stipulated that Jewish immigration to Palestine was to be limited to 15,000 a year for the first five years, and would subsequently be contingent on Arab consent. Restrictions were also placed on the rights of Jews to buy land from Arabs. After this Ben-Gurion changed his policy towards the British, stating: \"Peace in Palestine is not the best situation for thwarting the policy of the White Paper\". Ben-Gurion believed a peaceful solution with the Arabs had no chance and soon began preparing the Yishuv for war. According to Teveth \"through his campaign to mobilize the Yishuv in support of the British war effort, he strove to build the nucleus of a 'Hebrew Army', and his success in this endeavor later brought victory to Zionism in the struggle to establish a Jewish state.\"\nDuring the Second World War, Ben-Gurion encouraged the Jewish population to volunteer for the British Army. He famously told Jews to \"support the British as if there is no White Paper and oppose the White Paper as if there is no war\". About 10% of the Jewish population of Palestine volunteered for the British Armed Forces, including many women. At the same time Ben-Gurion assisted the illegal immigration of thousands of European Jewish refugees to Palestine during a period when the British placed heavy restrictions on Jewish immigration.\nIn 1944, the Irgun and Lehi, two Jewish right-wing armed groups, declared a rebellion against British rule and began attacking British administrative and police targets. Ben-Gurion and other mainstream Zionist leaders opposed armed action against the British, and after Lehi assassinated Lord Moyne, the British Minister of State in the Middle East, decided to stop it by force. While Lehi was convinced to suspend operations, the Irgun refused and as a result, the Haganah began supplying intelligence to the British enabling them to arrest Irgun members, and abducting and often torturing Irgun members, handing some over to the British while keeping others detained in secret Haganah prisons. This campaign, which was called the Saison or \"Hunting Season\", left the Irgun unable to continue operations as they struggled to survive. Irgun leader Menachem Begin ordered his fighters not to retaliate so as to prevent a civil war. The Saison became increasingly controversial in the Yishuv, including within the ranks of the Haganah, and it was aborted at the end of March 1945.\nAt the end of World War II, the Zionist leadership in Palestine had expected a British decision to establish a Jewish state. However, it became clear that the British had no intention of immediately establishing a Jewish state and that limits on Jewish immigration would remain for the time being. As a result, with Ben-Gurion's approval the Haganah entered into a secret alliance with the Irgun and Lehi called the Jewish Resistance Movement in October 1945 and participated in attacks against the British. In June 1946, the British launched Operation Agatha, a large police and military operation throughout Palestine, searching for arms and arresting Jewish leaders and Haganah members in order to stop the attacks and find documentary evidence of the alliance the British suspected existed between the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi. The British had intended to detain Ben-Gurion during the operation but he was visiting Paris at the time. The British stored the documents they had captured from the Jewish Agency headquarters in the King David Hotel, which was being used as a military and administrative headquarters. Ben-Gurion agreed to the Irgun's plan to bomb the King David Hotel in order to destroy incriminating documents that Ben-Gurion feared would prove that the Haganah had been participating in the violent insurrection against the British in cooperation with the Irgun and Lehi with the approval of himself and other Jewish Agency officials. However, Ben-Gurion asked that the operation be delayed, but the Irgun refused. The Irgun carried out the King David Hotel bombing in July 1946, killing 91 people. Ben-Gurion publicly condemned the bombing. In the aftermath of the bombing, Ben-Gurion ordered that the Jewish Resistance Movement be dissolved. From then on, the Irgun and Lehi continued to regularly attack the British, but the Haganah rarely did so, and while Ben-Gurion along with other mainstream Zionist leaders publicly condemned the Irgun and Lehi attacks, in practice the Haganah under their direction rarely cooperated with the British in attempting to suppress the insurgency.\nDue to the Jewish insurgency, bad publicity over the restriction of Jewish immigrants to Palestine, non-acceptance of a partitioned state (as suggested by the United Nations) amongst Arab leaders, and the cost of keeping 100,000 troops in Palestine the British Government referred the matter to the United Nations. In September 1947, the British decided to terminate the Mandate. In November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution approving the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. While the Jewish Agency under Ben-Gurion accepted, the Arabs rejected the plan and the 1947\u20131948 civil war in Mandatory Palestine broke out. Ben-Gurion's strategy was for the Haganah to hold on to every position with no retreat or surrender and then launch an offensive when British forces had evacuated to such an extent that there would be no more danger of British intervention. This strategy was successful, and by May 1948 Jewish forces were winning the civil war. On 14 May 1948, a few hours before the British Mandate officially terminated, Ben-Gurion declared Israeli independence in a ceremony in Tel Aviv. A few hours later, the State of Israel officially came into being when the British Mandate terminated on 15 May. The 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War began immediately afterwards as numerous Arab nations then invaded Israel.\nAttitude towards conquering the West Bank.\nAfter the ten-day campaign during the 1948 war, the Israelis were militarily superior to their enemies and the Cabinet subsequently considered where and when to attack next. On 24 September, an incursion made by the Palestinian irregulars in the Latrun sector, killing 23 Israeli soldiers, precipitated the debate. On 26 September, Ben-Gurion put his argument to the Cabinet to attack Latrun again and conquer the whole or a large part of West Bank. The motion was rejected by a vote of seven to five after discussions. Ben-Gurion qualified the cabinet's decision as (\"a source of lament for generations\") considering Israel may have lost forever the Old City of Jerusalem.\nThere is a controversy around these events. According to Uri Bar-Joseph, Ben-Gurion placed a plan that called for a limited action aimed at the conquest of Latrun, and not for an all-out offensive. According to David Tal, in the cabinet meeting, Ben-Gurion reacted to what he had been just told by a delegation from Jerusalem. He points out that this view that Ben-Gurion had planned to conquer the West Bank is unsubstantiated in both Ben-Gurion's diary and in the Cabinet protocol.\nThe topic came back at the end of the 1948 war, when General Yigal Allon also proposed the conquest of the West Bank up to the Jordan River as the natural, defensible border of the state. This time, Ben-Gurion refused although he was aware that the IDF was militarily strong enough to carry out the conquest. He feared the reaction of Western powers and wanted to maintain good relations with the United States and not to provoke the British. Moreover, in his opinion the results of the war were already satisfactory and Israeli leaders had to focus on the building of a nation.\nAccording to Benny Morris, \"Ben-Gurion got cold feet during the war. ... If [he] had carried out a large expulsion and cleansed the whole country -the whole Land of Israel, as far as the Jordan River. It may yet turn out that this was his fatal mistake. If he had carried out a full expulsion rather than a partial one- he would have stabilized the State of Israel for generations.\"\nReligious parties and status quo.\nIn order to prevent the coalescence of the religious right, the Histadrut agreed to a vague status quo agreement with Mizrahi in 1935.\nBen-Gurion was aware that world Jewry could and would only feel comfortable to throw their support behind the nascent state if it was shrouded with religious mystique. That would include an orthodox tacit acquiescence to the entity. Therefore, in September 1947 Ben-Gurion decided to reach a formal status quo agreement with the Orthodox Agudat Yisrael party. He sent a letter to Agudat Yisrael stating that while being committed to establishing a non-theocratic state with freedom of religion, he promised that the Shabbat would be Israel's official day of rest, that in state-provided kitchens there would be access to kosher food, that every effort would be made to provide a single jurisdiction for Jewish family affairs, and that each sector would be granted autonomy in the sphere of education, provided minimum standards regarding the curriculum be observed. To a large extent this agreement provided the framework for religious affairs in Israel till the present day, and is often used as a benchmark regarding the arrangement of religious affairs in Israel.\nReligious belief.\nBen-Gurion described himself as an irreligious person who developed atheism in his youth and who demonstrated no great sympathy for the elements of traditional Judaism, though he quoted the Bible extensively in his speeches and writings. Modern Orthodox philosopher Yeshayahu Leibowitz considered Ben-Gurion \"to have hated Judaism more than any other man he had met\". He was proud of the fact that he had only set foot in a synagogue once in Israel, worked on Yom Kippur and ate pork.\nIn later time, Ben-Gurion refused to define himself as \"secular\", and he regarded himself a believer in God. In a 1970 interview, he described himself as a pantheist, and stated that \"I don't know if there's an afterlife. I think there is.\" In 1969 he combined his Zionism with a moderate religious view: \"In 1948 the establishment of a Hebrew state and the independence of Israel were declared, because our people were sure that their prayer would be answered if they would return to the land\". During an interview with the leftist weekly \"Hotam\" two years before his death, he revealed, \"I too have a deep faith in the Almighty. I believe in one God, the omnipotent Creator. My consciousness is aware of the existence of material and spirit ... [But] I cannot understand how order reigns in nature, in the world and universe\u2014unless there exists a superior force. This supreme Creator is beyond my comprehension . . . but it directs everything.\"\nIn a letter to the writer Eliezer Steinman, he wrote \"Today, more than ever, the 'religious' tend to relegate Judaism to observing dietary laws and preserving the Sabbath. This is considered religious reform. I prefer the Fifteenth Psalm, lovely are the psalms of Israel. The Shulchan Aruch is a product of our nation's life in the Exile. It was produced in the Exile, in conditions of Exile. A nation in the process of fulfilling its every task, physically and spiritually ... must compose a 'New Shulchan'\u2014and our nation's intellectuals are required, in my opinion, to fulfill their responsibility in this.\"\nMilitary leadership.\nDuring the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War Ben-Gurion oversaw the nascent state's military operations. During the first weeks of Israel's independence, he ordered all militias to be replaced by one national army, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). To that end, Ben-Gurion used a firm hand during the Altalena Affair, a ship carrying arms purchased by the Irgun led by Menachem Begin. He insisted that all weapons be handed over to the IDF. When fighting broke out on the Tel Aviv beach he ordered it be taken by force and to shell the ship. Sixteen Irgun fighters and three IDF soldiers were killed in this battle. Following the policy of a unified military force, he also ordered that the Palmach headquarters be disbanded and its units be integrated with the rest of the IDF, to the chagrin of many of its members. By absorbing the Irgun force into Israel's IDF, the Israelis eliminated competition and the central government controlled all military forces within the country. His attempts to reduce the number of Mapam members in the senior ranks led to the \"Generals' Revolt\" in June 1948.\nAs head of the Jewish Agency from 1935, Ben-Gurion was de facto leader of the Jewish population even before the state was declared. In this position, Ben-Gurion played a major role in the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War. When the IDF archives and others were opened in the late 1980s, scholars started to reconsider the events and the role of Ben-Gurion.\nDavid Ben-Gurion oversaw and approved Israel's biological warfare poisoning operations against Palestinian Arab civilians in Operation Cast Thy Bread during the 1948 war. The poisoning operations involved targeting dozens of Palestinian water wells with typhoid and dysentery bacteria, as well as the aqueducts in Palestinian cities such as Acre. These operations caused typhoid epidemics and mass infections.\nPlan Dalet.\nPlan Dalet was a plan worked out by the Haganah in Mandatory Palestine in March 1948, requested by Ben Gurion, consisting of a set of guidelines to take control of Mandatory Palestine, declare a Jewish state, and defend its borders and people, including the Jewish population outside of the borders, \"before, and in anticipation of\" the invasion by regular Arab armies. According to the Israeli Yehoshafat Harkabi, Plan Dalet called for the conquest of Arab towns and villages inside and along the borders of the area allocated to the proposed Jewish State in the UN Partition Plan. In case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.\nThe intent of Plan Dalet has been long debated by historians. Some assert that it was entirely defensive , while others say it was a deliberate plan with the purpose of expulsion or ethnic cleansing .\nFounding of Israel.\nOn 14 May 1948, on the last day of the British Mandate, Ben-Gurion declared the independence of the State of Israel. In the Israeli declaration of independence, he stated that the new nation would \"uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens, without distinction of religion, race\".\nIn his War Diaries in February 1948, Ben-Gurion wrote: \"The war shall give us the land. The concepts of 'ours' and 'not ours' are peace concepts only, and they lose their meaning during war.\" Also later he confirmed this by stating that, \"In the Negev we shall not buy the land. We shall conquer it. You forget that we are at war.\" The Arabs, meanwhile, also vied with Israel over the control of territory by means of war, while the Jordanian \"Arab Legion\" had decided to concentrate its forces in Bethlehem and in Hebron in order to save that district for its Arab inhabitants, and to prevent territorial gains for Israel. Israeli historian Benny Morris has written of the massacres of Palestinian Arabs in 1948, and has stated that Ben-Gurion \"covered up for the officers who did the massacres.\"\nFirst tenure as prime minister.\nAfter leading Israel during the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Ben-Gurion was elected Prime Minister of Israel when his Mapai (Labour) party won the largest number of Knesset seats in the first national election, held on 14 February 1949. He remained in that post until 1963, except for a period of nearly two years between 1954 and 1955. As prime minister, he oversaw the establishment of the state's institutions. He presided over various national projects aimed at the rapid development of the country and its population: Operation Magic Carpet, the airlift of Jews from Arab countries, the construction of the National Water Carrier, rural development projects and the establishment of new towns and cities. In particular, he called for pioneering settlement in outlying areas, especially in the Negev. Ben-Gurion saw the struggle to make the Negev desert bloom as an area where the Jewish people could make a major contribution to humanity as a whole. He believed that the sparsely populated and barren Negev desert offered a great opportunity for the Jews to settle in Palestine with minimal obstruction of the Arab population, and set a personal example by settling in kibbutz Sde Boker at the center of the Negev.\nReprisal operations.\nDuring this period, Palestinian fedayeen repeatedly infiltrated into Israel from Arab territory. In 1953, after a handful of unsuccessful retaliatory actions, Ben-Gurion charged Ariel Sharon, then security chief of the northern region, with setting up a new commando unit designed to respond to fedayeen infiltrations. Ben-Gurion told Sharon, \"The Palestinians must learn that they will pay a high price for Israeli lives.\" Sharon formed Unit 101, a small commando unit answerable directly to the IDF General Staff tasked with retaliating for fedayeen raids. During its five months of existence, the unit launched repeated raids against military targets and villages used as bases by the fedayeen. These attacks became known as the reprisal operations. One such operation gained international condemnation of Israel, after an Israeli army attack on the village of Qibya in the then Jordanian-ruled West Bank, ended with a massacre of 69 Palestinian villagers, two thirds of them women and children. Ben Gurion denied involvement of the army and placed blame on Israeli civilians, a fabrication which was repeated by him at the UN. He was seen as having protected involved subordinates in the military from accountability.\nActing prime minister.\nIn 1953, Ben-Gurion announced his intention to withdraw from government and was replaced by Moshe Sharett, who was elected the second Prime Minister of Israel in January 1954. However, Ben-Gurion temporarily served as acting prime minister when Sharett visited the United States in 1955. During Ben-Gurion's tenure as acting prime minister, the IDF carried out Operation Olive Leaves, a successful attack on fortified Syrian emplacements near the northeastern shores of the Sea of Galilee. The operation was a response to Syrian attacks on Israeli fishermen. Ben-Gurion had ordered the operation without consulting the Israeli cabinet and seeking a vote on the matter, and Sharett would later bitterly complain that Ben-Gurion had exceeded his authority.\nSecond tenure as prime minister.\nBen-Gurion returned to government in 1955. He assumed the post of defence minister and was soon re-elected prime minister. When he returned to government, Israeli forces began responding more aggressively to Egyptian-sponsored Palestinian guerrilla attacks from Gaza, which was under Egyptian rule. Egypt's President Gamal Abdel Nasser signed the Egyptian-Czech arms deal and purchased a large number of modern arms. The Israelis responded by arming themselves with help from France. Nasser blocked the passage of Israeli ships through the Straits of Tiran and the Suez Canal. In July 1956, the United States and Britain withdrew their offer to fund the Aswan High Dam project on the Nile and a week later, Nasser ordered the nationalisation of the French and British-controlled Suez Canal. In late 1956, the bellicosity of Arab statements prompted Israel to remove the threat of the concentrated Egyptian forces in the Sinai, and Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula. Other Israeli aims were elimination of the fedayeen incursions into Israel that made life unbearable for its southern population and opening the blockaded Straits of Tiran for Israeli ships. Israel occupied much of the peninsula within a few days. As agreed beforehand, within a couple of days, Britain and France invaded too, aiming at regaining Western control of the Suez Canal and removing the Egyptian president Nasser. The United States pressure forced the British and French to back down and Israel to withdraw from Sinai in return for free Israeli navigation through the Red Sea. The United Nations responded by establishing its first peacekeeping force, (UNEF). It was stationed between Egypt and Israel and for the next decade it maintained peace and stopped the fedayeen incursions into Israel.\nIn 1957, Ben-Gurion was injured by a grenade thrown into the Knesset plenum by a troubled Jewish immigrant from Syria, Moshe Dwek, who claimed that nobody was being attentive to his needs.\nIn 1959, Ben-Gurion learned from West German officials of reports that the notorious Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann, was likely living in hiding in Argentina. In response, Ben-Gurion ordered the Israel foreign intelligence service, the Mossad, to capture the international fugitive alive for trial in Israel. In 1960, the mission was accomplished, and Eichmann was tried and convicted in an internationally publicised trial for various offences including crimes against humanity and was subsequently executed in 1962.\nBen-Gurion is said to have been \"nearly obsessed\" with Israel's obtaining nuclear weapons, feeling that a nuclear arsenal was the only way to counter the Arabs' superiority in numbers, space, and financial resources, and that it was the only sure guarantee of Israel's survival and the prevention of another Holocaust. During his final months as premier Ben-Gurion was engaged in a, now declassified, diplomatic standoff with the United States.\nBen-Gurion stepped down as prime minister on 16 June 1963. According to historian Yechiam Weitz, when he unexpectedly resigned:\nHe was asked to reconsider his decision by the cabinet. The country, however, seemed to have anticipated his move and, unlike the response to his resignation in 1953, no serious efforts were made to dissuade him from resigning... [His reasons include] his political isolation, suspicion of colleagues and rivals, apparent inability to interact with the full spectrum of reality, and belief that his life's work was disintegrating. His resignation was not an act of farewell but another act of his personal struggle and possibly an indication of his mental state.\nBen-Gurion chose Levi Eshkol as his successor. A year later a bitter rivalry developed between the two on the issue of the Lavon Affair, a failed 1954 Israeli covert operation in Egypt. Ben-Gurion had insisted that the operation be properly investigated, while Eshkol refused. After failing to unseat Eshkol as Mapai party leader in the 1965 Mapai leadership election, Ben-Gurion subsequently broke with Mapai in June 1965 and formed a new party, Rafi, while Mapai merged with Ahdut HaAvoda to form Alignment, with Eshkol as its head. Alignment defeated Rafi in the November 1965 election, establishing Eshkol as the country's leader.\nLater political career.\nIn May 1967, Egypt began massing forces in the Sinai Peninsula after expelling UN peacekeepers and closed the Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping. This, together with the actions of other Arab states, caused Israel to begin preparing for war. The situation lasted until the outbreak of the Six-Day War on 5 June. In Jerusalem, there were calls for a national unity government or an emergency government. During this period, Ben-Gurion met with his old rival Menachem Begin in Sde Boker. Begin asked Ben-Gurion to join Eshkol's national unity government. Although Eshkol's Mapai party initially opposed the widening of its government, it eventually changed its mind. On 23 May, IDF Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin met with Ben-Gurion to ask for reassurance. Ben-Gurion, however, accused Rabin of putting Israel in mortal danger by mobilising the reserves and openly preparing for war with an Arab coalition. Ben-Gurion told Rabin that at the very least, he should have obtained the support of a foreign power, as he had done during the Suez Crisis. Rabin was shaken by the meeting and took to bed for 36 hours.\nAfter the Israeli government decided to go to war, planning a preemptive strike to destroy the Egyptian Air Force followed by a ground offensive, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan told Ben-Gurion of the impending attack on the night of 4\u20135 June. Ben-Gurion subsequently wrote in his diary that he was troubled by Israel's impending offensive. On 5 June, the Six-Day War began with Operation Focus, an Israeli air attack that decimated the Egyptian air force. Israel then captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria in a series of campaigns. Following the war, Ben-Gurion was in favour of returning all the captured territories apart from East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights and Mount Hebron as part of a peace agreement.\nOn 11 June, Ben-Gurion met with a small group of supporters in his home. During the meeting, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan proposed autonomy for the West Bank, the transfer of Gazan refugees to Jordan, and a united Jerusalem serving as Israel's capital. Ben-Gurion agreed with him but foresaw problems in transferring Palestinian refugees from Gaza to Jordan, and recommended that Israel insist on direct talks with Egypt, favouring withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula in exchange for peace and free navigation through the Straits of Tiran. The following day, he met with Jerusalem mayor Teddy Kollek in his Knesset office. Despite occupying a lower executive position, Ben-Gurion treated Kollek like a subordinate.\nFollowing the Six-Day War, Ben-Gurion criticised what he saw as the government's apathy towards the construction and development of the city. To ensure that a united Jerusalem remained in Israeli hands, he advocated a massive Jewish settlement programme for the Old City and the hills surrounding the city, as well as the establishment of large industries in the Jerusalem area to attract Jewish migrants. He argued that no Arabs would have to be evicted in the process. Ben-Gurion also urged extensive Jewish settlement in Hebron.\nIn 1968, when Rafi merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Ben-Gurion refused to reconcile with his old party. He favoured electoral reforms in which a constituency-based system would replace what he saw as a chaotic proportional representation method. He formed another new party, the National List, which won four seats in the 1969 election.\nFinal years and death.\nBen-Gurion retired from politics in 1970 and spent his last years living in a modest home in kibbutz Sde Boker, working on an 11-volume history of Israel's early years. In 1971, he visited Israeli positions along the Suez Canal during the War of Attrition.\nOn 18 November 1973, shortly after the Yom Kippur War, Ben-Gurion suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, and was taken to Sheba Medical Center in Tel HaShomer, Ramat Gan. His condition began deteriorating on 23 November and he died a few days later, on 1 December. His body lay in state in the Knesset compound before being flown by helicopter to Sde Boker. Sirens sounded across the country to mark his death. He was buried alongside his wife Paula in the Ben-Gurion Tomb National Park at Midreshet Ben-Gurion. \nControversies.\nBen Gurion was among the Zionist leaders who prioritized Zionist goals over rescuing Jews during the Holocaust. \nThe following 1938 quote by him summarizes this view: \n\"If I knew that it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by transporting them to England, and only half of them by transporting them to Eretz Israel, I would choose the second \u2013 because we are not only accounting for these children, but also for the history of the Jewish people.\" Whereas at the time he probably could not have imagined the extent of the imminent great tragedy, the ideology remained a cornerstone of mainstream Zionist ideology all through the Holocaust.\nWhen Revisionist Zionist founder Ze'ev Jabotinsky died visiting a Zionist self-defense camp in the Catskill region in 1940, he was buried in Farmingdale, New York in accordance to his will about being buried where he died while also wishing that his remains be \"transferred to the Land of Israel only at the express order of the Jewish government of that country.\" Ben-Gurion had great animosity toward Jabotinsky (once calling him \"Vladimir Hitler\") and refused to allow his reburial in Israel after independence in the decade leading to his retirement in 1963. Much later, Prime Minister Levi Eshkol gave permission for reburial in Jerusalem's Mount Herzl in 1964.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

There is a variety of sail plans that propel sailing ships, employing square-rigged or fore-and-aft sails. Some ships carry square sails on each mast\u2014the brig and full-rigged ship, said to be \"ship-rigged\" when there are three or more masts. Others carry only fore-and-aft sails on each mast, for instance some schooners. Still others employ a combination of square and fore-and-aft sails, including the barque, barquentine, and brigantine.\nEarly sailing ships were used for river and coastal waters in ancient Egypt and the Mediterranean. The Austronesian peoples developed maritime technologies that included the fore-and-aft crab-claw sail and with catamaran and outrigger hull configurations, which enabled the Austronesian expansion into the islands of the Indo-Pacific. This expansion originated in Taiwan c.\u20093000 BC and propagated through Island Southeast Asia, reaching Near Oceania c.\u20091500 BC, Hawaii c.\u2009900 AD, and New Zealand c.\u20091200 AD. The maritime trading network in the Indo-Pacific dates from at least 1500 BC. Later developments in Asia produced the junk and dhow\u2014vessels that incorporated features unknown in Europe at the time.\nEuropean sailing ships with predominantly square rigs became prevalent during the Age of Discovery (15th to 17th centuries), when they crossed oceans between continents and around the world. In the European Age of Sail, a full-rigged ship was one with a bowsprit and three masts, each of which consists of a lower, top, and topgallant mast. Most sailing ships were merchantmen, but the Age of Sail also saw the development of large fleets of well-armed warships. The many steps of technological development of steamships during the 19th century provided slowly increasing competition for sailing ships\u2014initially only on short routes where high prices could be charged. By the 1880s, ships with triple-expansion steam engines had the fuel efficiency to compete with sail on all major routes\u2014and with scheduled sailings that were not affected by the wind direction. However, commercial sailing vessels could still be found working into the 20th century, although in reducing numbers and only in certain trades.\nHistory.\nBy the Age of Discovery\u2014starting in the 15th century\u2014square-rigged, multi-masted vessels were the norm and were guided by navigation techniques that included the magnetic compass and making sightings of the sun and stars that allowed transoceanic voyages. The Age of Sail reached its peak in the 18th and 19th centuries with large, heavily armed battleships and merchant sailing ships.\nSailing and steam ships coexisted for much of the 19th century. The steamers of the early part of the century had very poor fuel efficiency and were suitable only for a small number of roles, such as towing sailing ships and providing short route passenger and mail services. Both sailing and steam ships saw large technological improvements over the century. Ultimately the two large stepwise improvements in fuel efficiency of compound and then triple-expansion steam engines made the steamship, by the 1880s, able to compete in the vast majority of trades. Commercial sail still continued into the 20th century, with the last ceasing to trade by c.\u20091960.\nSouth China Sea and Austronesia.\nEarly sea-going sailing vessels were used by the Austronesian peoples. The invention of catamarans, outriggers, and crab claw sails enabled the Austronesian Expansion at around 3000 to 1500 BC. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar. Austronesian rigs were distinctive in that they had spars supporting both the upper and lower edges of the sails (and sometimes in between), in contrast to western rigs which only had a spar on the upper edge.\nLarge Austronesian trading ships with as many as four sails were recorded by Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 220 AD) scholars as the \"kunlun bo\" or \"K'un-lun po\" (\u5d11\u5d19\u8236, lit. \"ship of the Kunlun people\"). They were booked by Chinese Buddhist pilgrims for passage to Southern India and Sri Lanka. Bas reliefs of large Javanese outriggers ships with various configurations of tanja sails are also found in the Borobudur temple, dating back to the 8th century CE.\nBy the 10th century AD, the Song dynasty started building the first Chinese seafaring junks, which adopted several features of the \"K'un-lun po\". The junk rig in particular, became associated with Chinese coast-hugging trading ships. Junks in China were constructed from teak with pegs and nails; they featured watertight compartments and acquired center-mounted tillers and rudders. These ships became the basis for the development of Chinese warships during the Mongol Yuan dynasty, and were used in the unsuccessful Mongol invasions of Japan and Java.\nThe Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) saw the use of junks as long-distance trading vessels. Chinese Admiral Zheng He reportedly sailed to India, Arabia, and southern Africa on a trade and diplomatic mission. Literary lore suggests that his largest vessel, the \"Treasure Ship\", measured in length and in width, whereas modern research suggests that it was unlikely to have exceeded in length.\nMediterranean and Baltic.\nSailing ships in the Mediterranean region date back to at least 3000 BC, when Egyptians used a bipod mast to support a single square sail on a vessel that mainly relied on multiple paddlers. Later the mast became a single pole, and paddles were supplanted with oars. Such vessels plied both the Nile and the Mediterranean coast. The Minoan civilization of Crete may have been the world's first thalassocracy brought to prominence by sailing vessels dating to before 1800 BC (Middle Minoan IIB). Between 1000 BC and 400 AD, the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans developed ships that were powered by square sails, sometimes with oars to supplement their capabilities. Such vessels used a steering oar as a rudder to control direction. \nStarting in the 8th century in Denmark, Vikings were building clinker-constructed longships propelled by a single, square sail, when practical, and oars, when necessary. A related craft was the knarr, which plied the Baltic and North Seas, using primarily sail power. The windward edge of the sail was stiffened with a beitass, a pole that fitted into the lower corner of the sail, when sailing close to the wind.\nIndian Ocean.\nIndia's maritime history began during the 3rd millennium BCE when inhabitants of the Indus Valley initiated maritime trading contact with Mesopotamia. Indian kingdoms such as the Kalinga from as early as 2nd century CE are believed to have had sailing ships. One of the earliest instances of documented evidence of Indian sailing ship building comes from the mural of three-masted ship in the Ajanta caves that date back to 400-500 CE.\nThe Indian Ocean was the venue for increasing trade between India and Africa between 1200 and 1500. The vessels employed would be classified as dhows with lateen rigs. During this interval such vessels grew in capacity from 100 to 400 tonnes. Dhows were often built with teak planks from India and Southeast Asia, sewn together with coconut husk fiber\u2014no nails were employed. This period also saw the implementation of center-mounted rudders, controlled with a tiller.\nGlobal exploration.\nTechnological advancements that were important to the Age of Discovery in the 15th century were the adoption of the magnetic compass and advances in ship design.\nThe compass was an addition to the ancient method of navigation based on sightings of the sun and stars. The compass was invented by Chinese. It had been used for navigation in China by the 11th century and was adopted by the Arab traders in the Indian Ocean. The compass spread to Europe by the late 12th or early 13th century. Use of the compass for navigation in the Indian Ocean was first mentioned in 1232. The Europeans used a \"dry\" compass, with a needle on a pivot. The compass card was also a European invention.\nAt the beginning of the 15th century, the carrack was the most capable European ocean-going ship. It was carvel-built and large enough to be stable in heavy seas. It was capable of carrying a large cargo and the provisions needed for very long voyages. Later carracks were square-rigged on the foremast and mainmast and lateen-rigged on the mizzenmast. They had a high rounded stern with large aftcastle, forecastle and bowsprit at the stem. As the predecessor of the galleon, the carrack was one of the most influential ship designs in history; while ships became more specialized in the following centuries, the basic design remained unchanged throughout this period.\nShips of this era were only able to sail approximately 70\u00b0 into the wind and tacked from one side to the other across the wind with difficulty, which made it challenging to avoid shipwrecks when near shores or shoals during storms. Nonetheless, such vessels reached India around Africa with Vasco da Gama, the Americas with Christopher Columbus, and around the world under Ferdinand Magellan.\n1700 to 1850.\nSailing ships became longer and faster over time, with ship-rigged vessels carrying taller masts with more square sails. Other sail plans emerged, as well, that had just fore-and-aft sails (schooners), or a mixture of the two (brigantines, barques and barquentines).\nWarships.\nCannons were introduced in the 14th century, but did not become common at sea until they could be reloaded quickly enough to be reused in the same battle. The size of a ship required to carry a large number of cannon made oar-based propulsion impossible, and warships came to rely primarily on sails. The sailing man-of-war emerged during the 16th century.\nBy the middle of the 17th century, warships were carrying increasing numbers of cannon on three decks. Naval tactics evolved to bring each ship's firepower to bear in a line of battle\u2014coordinated movements of a fleet of warships to engage a line of ships in the enemy fleet. Carracks with a single cannon deck evolved into galleons with as many as two full cannon decks, which evolved into the man-of-war, and further into the ship of the line\u2014designed for engaging the enemy in a line of battle. One side of a ship was expected to shoot broadsides against an enemy ship at close range. In the 18th century, the small and fast frigate and sloop-of-war\u2014too small to stand in the line of battle\u2014evolved to convoy trade, scout for enemy ships and blockade enemy coasts.\nClippers.\nThe term \"clipper\" started to be used in the first quarter of the 19th century. It was applied to sailing vessels designed primarily for speed. Only a small proportion of sailing vessels could properly have the term applied to them.\nEarly examples were the schooners and brigantines, called Baltimore clippers, used for blockade running or as privateers in the War of 1812 and afterwards for smuggling opium or illegally transporting slaves. Larger clippers, usually ship or barque rigged and with a different hull design, were built for the California trade (from east coast USA ports to San Francisco) after gold was discovered in 1848 \u2013 the associated shipbuilding boom lasted until 1854.\nClippers were built for trade between the United Kingdom and China after the East India Company lost its monopoly in 1834. The primary cargo was tea, and sailing ships, particularly tea clippers, dominated this long-distance route until the development of fuel efficient steamships coincided with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.\nOther clippers worked on the Australian immigrant routes or, in smaller quantities, in any role where a fast passage secured higher rates of freight or passenger fares. Whilst many clippers were ship rigged, the definition is not limited to any rig.\nClippers were generally built for a specific trade: those in the California trade had to withstand the seas of Cape Horn, whilst Tea Clippers were designed for the lighter and contrary winds of the China Sea. All had fine lines, with a well streamlined hull and carried a large sail area. To get the best of this, a skilled and determined master was needed in command.\nCopper sheathing.\nDuring the Age of Sail, ships' hulls were under frequent attack by shipworm (which affected the structural strength of timbers), and barnacles and various marine weeds (which affected ship speed). Since before the common era, a variety of coatings had been applied to hulls to counter this effect, including pitch, wax, tar, oil, sulfur and arsenic. In the mid 18th century copper sheathing was developed as a defense against such bottom fouling. After coping with problems of galvanic deterioration of metal hull fasteners, sacrificial anodes were developed, which were designed to corrode, instead of the hull fasteners. The practice became widespread on naval vessels, starting in the late 18th century, and on merchant vessels, starting in the early 19th century, until the advent of iron and steel hulls.\n1850 to 1900.\nIron-hulled sailing ships, often referred to as \"windjammers\" or \"tall ships\", represented the final evolution of sailing ships at the end of the Age of Sail. They were built to carry bulk cargo for long distances in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were the largest of merchant sailing ships, with three to five masts and square sails, as well as other sail plans. They carried lumber, guano, grain or ore between continents. Later examples had steel hulls. Iron-hulled sailing ships were mainly built from the 1870s to 1900, when steamships began to outpace them economically, due to their ability to keep a schedule regardless of the wind. Steel hulls also replaced iron hulls at around the same time. Even into the twentieth century, sailing ships could hold their own on transoceanic voyages such as Australia to Europe, since they did not require bunkerage for coal nor fresh water for steam, and they were faster than the early steamers, which usually could barely make .\nThe four-masted, iron-hulled ship, introduced in 1875 with the full-rigged , represented an especially efficient configuration that prolonged the competitiveness of sail against steam in the later part of the 19th century. The largest example of such ships was the five-masted, full-rigged ship , which had a load capacity of 7,800 tonnes. Ships transitioned from all sail to all steam-power from the mid 19th century into the 20th. Five-masted \"Preussen\" used steam power for driving the winches, hoists and pumps, and could be manned by a crew of 48, compared with four-masted \"Kruzenshtern\", which has a crew of 257.\nCoastal top-sail schooners with a crew as small as two managing the sail handling became an efficient way to carry bulk cargo, since only the fore-sails required tending while tacking and steam-driven machinery was often available for raising the sails and the anchor.\n1950 to 2000.\nIn the 20th century, the DynaRig allowed central, automated control of all sails in a manner that obviates the need for sending crew aloft. This was developed in the 1960s in Germany as a low-carbon footprint propulsion alternative for commercial ships. The rig automatically sets and reefs sails; its mast rotates to align the sails with the wind. The sailing yachts \"Maltese Falcon\" and \"Black Pearl\" employ the rig.\n21st century and contemporary experimental sail.\nIn the 21st century, due to concern about climate change and the possibility of cost savings, companies explored using wind-power to reduce heavy fuel needs on large containerized cargo ships. By 2023, around 30 ships were using sails or attached kites, with the number expected to grow. The following year, \"The Economist\" wrote that the technology was at an inflection point as it moved from trials and testing towards adoption by the industry.\nFeatures.\nEvery sailing ship has a sail plan that is adapted to the purpose of the vessel and the ability of the crew; each has a hull, rigging and masts to hold up the sails that use the wind to power the ship; the masts are supported by standing rigging and the sails are adjusted by running rigging.\nHull.\nHull shapes for sailing ships evolved from being relatively short and blunt to being longer and finer at the bow. By the nineteenth century, ships were built with reference to a half model, made from wooden layers that were pinned together. Each layer could be scaled to the actual size of the vessel in order to lay out its hull structure, starting with the keel and leading to the ship's ribs. The ribs were pieced together from curved elements, called futtocks and tied in place until the installation of the planking. Typically, planking was caulked with a tar-impregnated yarn made from manila or hemp to make the planking watertight. Starting in the mid-19th century, iron was used first for the hull structure and later for its watertight sheathing.\nMasts.\nUntil the mid-19th century all vessels' masts were made of wood formed from a single or several pieces of timber which typically consisted of the trunk of a conifer tree. From the 16th century, vessels were often built of a size requiring masts taller and thicker than could be made from single tree trunks. On these larger vessels, to achieve the required height, the masts were built from up to four sections (also called masts), known in order of rising height above the decks as the lower, top, topgallant and royal masts. Giving the lower sections sufficient thickness necessitated building them up from separate pieces of wood. Such a section was known as a \"made mast\", as opposed to sections formed from single pieces of timber, which were known as \"pole masts\". Starting in the second half of the 19th century, masts were made of iron or steel.\nFor ships with square sails the principal masts, given their standard names in bow to stern (front to back) order, are:\nSails.\nEach rig is configured in a \"sail plan\", appropriate to the size of the sailing craft. Both square-rigged and fore-and-aft rigged vessels have been built with a wide range of configurations for single and multiple masts.\nTypes of sail that can be part of a sail plan can be broadly classed by how they are \"attached\" to the sailing craft:\nRigging.\nSailing ships have \"standing rigging\" to support the masts and \"running rigging\" to raise the sails and control their ability to draw power from the wind. The running rigging has three main roles, to support the sail structure, to shape the sail and to adjust its angle to the wind. Square-rigged vessels require more controlling lines than fore-and-aft rigged ones.\nStanding rigging.\nSailing ships prior to the mid-19th century used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller by the end of the 19th century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the \"lower mast\", \"top mast\", and \"topgallant mast\". This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs of deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line\u2014\"lanyard\"\u2014to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud. After the mid-19th century square-rigged vessels were equipped with iron wire standing rigging, which was superseded with steel wire in the late 19th century.46\nRunning rigging.\nHalyards, used to raise and lower the yards, are the primary supporting lines. In addition, square rigs have lines that lift the sail or the yard from which it is suspended that include: brails, buntlines, lifts and leechlines. Bowlines and clew lines shape a square sail. To adjust the angle of the sail to wind braces are used to adjust the fore and aft angle of a yard of a square sail, while sheets attach to the clews (bottom corners) of a sail to control the sail's angle to the wind. Sheets run aft, whereas tacks are used to haul the clew of a square sail forward.\nBallast.\nSailing ships needed ballast to keep the centre of gravity low and supply stability to the vessel when under sail. Ballast in the age of sail might consist of shingle, sand, lead, iron bars or bricks. Care had to be taken in the stowage of the ballast so that it did not move during heavy weather and endanger the ship and those aboard. Sand ballast, for instance, had to be contained by wooden boards, or in wooden boxes, to stop it moving about.\nCrew.\nThe crew of a sailing ship is divided between officers (the captain and his subordinates) and seamen or \"ordinary\" \"hands\". An able seaman was expected to \"hand, reef, and steer\" (handle the lines and other equipment, reef the sails, and steer the vessel). The crew is organized to stand watch\u2014the oversight of the ship for a period\u2014typically four hours each. Richard Henry Dana Jr. and Herman Melville each had personal experience aboard sailing vessels of the 19th century.\nMerchant vessel.\nDana described the crew of the merchant brig, \"Pilgrim\", as comprising six to eight common sailors, four specialist crew members (the steward, cook, carpenter and sailmaker), and three officers: the captain, the first mate and the second mate. He contrasted the American crew complement with that of other nations on whose similarly sized ships the crew might number as many as 30. Larger merchant vessels had larger crews.\nWarship.\nMelville described the crew complement of the frigate warship, \"United States\", as about 500\u2014including officers, enlisted personnel and 50 Marines. The crew was divided into the starboard and larboard watches. It was also divided into three \"tops\", bands of crew responsible for setting sails on the three masts; a band of \"sheet-anchor men\", whose station was forward and whose job was to tend the fore-yard, anchors and forward sails; the \"after guard\", who were stationed aft and tended the mainsail, spanker and manned the various sheets, controlling the position of the sails; the \"waisters\", who were stationed midships and had menial duties attending the livestock, etc.; and the \"holders\", who occupied the lower decks of the vessel and were responsible for the inner workings of the ship. He additionally named such positions as, boatswains, gunners, carpenters, coopers, painters, tinkers, stewards, cooks and various boys as functions on the man-of-war. 18-19th century ships of the line had a complement as high as 850.\nShip handling.\nHandling a sailing ship requires management of its sails to power\u2014but not overpower\u2014the ship and navigation to guide the ship, both at sea and in and out of harbors.\nUnder sail.\nKey elements of sailing a ship are setting the right amount of sail to generate maximum power without endangering the ship, adjusting the sails to the wind direction on the course sailed, and changing tack to bring the wind from one side of the vessel to the other.\nSetting sail.\nA sailing ship crew manages the running rigging of each square sail. Each sail has two sheets that control its lower corners, two braces that control the angle of the yard, two clewlines, four buntlines and two reef tackles. All these lines must be manned as the sail is deployed and the yard raised. They use a halyard to raise each yard and its sail; then they pull or ease the braces to set the angle of the yard across the vessel; they pull on sheets to haul lower corners of the sail, \"clews\", out to yard below. Under way, the crew manages \"reef tackles\", \"haul leeches\", \"reef points\", to manage the size and angle of the sail; \"bowlines\" pull the leading edge of the sail (\"leech\") taut when close hauled. When furling the sail, the crew uses \"clewlines\", haul up the clews and \"buntlines\" to haul up the middle of sail up; when lowered, \"lifts\" support each yard.\nIn strong winds, the crew is directed to reduce the number of sails or, alternatively, the amount of each given sail that is presented to the wind by a process called \"reefing\". To pull the sail up, seamen on the yardarm pull on \"reef tackles\", attached to \"reef cringles\", to pull the sail up and secure it with lines, called \"reef points\". Dana spoke of the hardships of sail handling during high wind and rain or with ice covering the ship and its rigging.\nChanging tack.\nSailing vessels cannot sail directly into the wind. Instead, square-riggers must sail a course that is between 60\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 away from the wind direction and fore-and aft vessels can typically sail no closer than 45\u00b0. To reach a destination, sailing vessels may have to change course and allow the wind to come from the opposite side in a procedure, called \"tacking\", when the wind comes across the bow during the maneuver.\nWhen tacking, a square-rigged vessel's sails must be presented squarely to the wind and thus impede forward motion as they are swung around via the yardarms through the wind as controlled by the vessel's running rigging, using braces\u2014adjusting the fore and aft angle of each yardarm around the mast\u2014and sheets attached to the clews (bottom corners) of each sail to control the sail's angle to the wind. The procedure is to turn the vessel into the wind with the hind-most fore-and-aft sail (the spanker), pulled to windward to help turn the ship through the eye of the wind. Once the ship has come about, all the sails are adjusted to align properly with the new tack. Because square-rigger masts are more strongly braced from behind than from ahead, tacking is a dangerous procedure in strong winds; the ship may lose forward momentum (become \"caught in stays\") and the rigging may fail from the wind coming from ahead. The ship may also lose momentum at wind speeds of less than . Under these conditions, the choice may be to \"wear ship\"\u2014to turn the ship away from the wind and around 240\u00b0 onto the next tack (60\u00b0 off the wind).\nA fore-and-aft rig permits the wind to flow past the sail, as the craft head through the eye of the wind. Most rigs pivot around a stay or the mast, while this occurs. For a jib, the old leeward sheet is released as the craft heads through the wind and the old windward sheet is tightened as the new leeward sheet to allow the sail to draw wind. Mainsails are often self-tending and slide on a traveler to the opposite side. On certain rigs, such as lateens and luggers, the sail may be partially lowered to bring it to the opposite side.\nNavigation.\nEarly navigational techniques employed observations of the sun, stars, waves and birdlife. In the 15th century, the Chinese were using the magnetic compass to identify direction of travel. By the 16th century in Europe, navigational instruments included the quadrant, the astrolabe, cross staff, dividers and compass. By the time of the Age of Exploration these tools were being used in combination with a log to measure speed, a lead line to measure soundings, and a lookout to identify potential hazards. Later, an accurate marine sextant became standard for determining latitude and was used with an accurate chronometer to calculate longitude.\nPassage planning begins with laying out a route along a chart, which comprises a series of courses between fixes\u2014verifiable locations that confirm the actual track of the ship on the ocean. Once a course has been set, the person at the helm attempts to follow its direction with reference to the compass. The navigator notes the time and speed at each fix to estimate the arrival at the next fix, a process called dead reckoning. For coast-wise navigation, sightings from known landmarks or navigational aids may be used to establish fixes, a process called pilotage. At sea, sailing ships used celestial navigation on a daily schedule, as follows:\nFixes were taken with a marine sextant, which measures the distance of the celestial body above the horizon.\nEntering and leaving harbor.\nGiven the limited maneuverability of sailing ships, it could be difficult to enter and leave harbor with the presence of a tide without coordinating arrivals with a flooding tide and departures with an ebbing tide. In harbor, a sailing ship stood at anchor, unless it needed to be loaded or unloaded at a dock or pier, in which case it might be warped alongside or towed by a tug. Warping involved using a long rope (the warp) between the ship and a fixed point on the shore. This was pulled on by a capstan on shore, or on the ship. This might be a multi-stage process if the route was not simple. If no fixed point was available, a kedge anchor might be taken out in a ship's boat to a suitable point and the ship then pulled up to the kedge. Square rigged vessels could use backing and filling (of the sails) to manoeuvre in a tideway, or control could be maintained by drudging the anchor - lower the anchor until it touches the bottom so that the dragging anchor gives steerage way in the flow of the tide.\nExamples.\nThese are examples of sailing ships; some terms have multiple meanings:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "67783", "revid": "30410", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=67783", "title": "Sailboat", "text": "Boat propelled partly or entirely by sails\nA sailboat or sailing boat is a boat propelled partly or entirely by sails and is smaller than a sailing ship. Distinctions in what constitutes a sailing boat and ship vary by region and maritime culture.\nTypes.\nFor a more complete list, see .\nAlthough sailboat terminology has varied across history, many terms have specific meanings in the context of modern yachting. A great number of sailboat-types may be distinguished by size, hull configuration, keel type, purpose, number and configuration of masts, and sail plan.\nPopular monohull designs include:\nCutter.\nThe cutter is similar to a sloop with a single mast and mainsail, but generally carries the mast further aft to allow for two foresails, a jib and staysail, to be attached to the head stay and inner forestay, respectively. Once a common racing configuration, today it gives versatility to cruising boats, especially in allowing a small staysail to be flown from the inner stay in high winds.\nCatboat.\nA catboat has a single mast mounted far forward and does not carry a jib. Most modern designs have only one sail, the mainsail; however, the traditional catboat could carry multiple sails from the gaff rig. Catboat is a charming and distinctive sailboat featuring a single mast with a single large sail, known as a gaff-rigged sail, and a broad beam that ensures stability. This type of vessel, named after the \"cat\" tackle used in sailing, has a rich history dating back to the 19th century in the coastal regions of the United States, particularly New England, where it was widely used by fishermen and sailors. With its straightforward design and uncomplicated rigging, the catboat offers a straightforward and laid-back sailing experience, making it an ideal choice for beginners and pleasure sailors alike. Even today, catboats continue to be cherished by enthusiasts who appreciate their heritage and enjoy their picturesque appearance while cruising through the waterways.\nDinghy.\nA dinghy is a type of small open sailboat commonly used for recreation, sail training, and tending a larger vessel. They are popular in youth sailing programs for their short LOA, simple operation and minimal maintenance. They have three (or fewer) sails: the mainsail, jib, and spinnaker.\nKetch.\nKetches are similar to a sloop, but there is a second shorter mast astern of the mainmast, but forward of the rudder post. The second mast is called the mizzen mast and the sail is called the mizzen sail. A ketch can also be http:// with two head sails.\nSchooner.\nA schooner has a mainmast taller than its foremast, distinguishing it from a ketch or a yawl. A schooner can have more than two masts, with the foremast always lower than the foremost main. Traditional topsail schooners have topmasts allowing triangular topsails sails to be flown above their gaff sails; many modern schooners are Bermuda rigged.\nSloop.\nThe most common modern sailboat is the sloop, which features one mast and two sails, typically a Bermuda rigged main, and a headsail. This simple configuration is very efficient for sailing into the wind.\nA fractional rigged sloop has its forestay attached at a point below the top of the mast, allowing the mainsail to be flattened to improve performance by raking the upper part of the mast aft by tensioning the backstay. A smaller headsail is easier for a short-handed crew to manage.\nYawl.\nA yawl is similar to a ketch, with a shorter mizzen mast carried astern the rudderpost more for balancing the helm than propulsion.\nHulls.\nTraditional sailboats are monohulls, but multi-hull catamarans and trimarans are gaining popularity. Monohull boats generally rely on ballast for stability and usually are displacement hulls. This stabilizing ballast can, in boats designed for racing, be as much as 50% of the weight of the boat, but is generally around 30%. It creates two problems; one, it gives the monohull tremendous inertia, making it less maneuverable and reducing its acceleration. Secondly, unless it has been built with buoyant foam or air tanks, if a monohull fills with water, it will sink.\nMultihulls rely on the geometry and the broad stance of their multiple hulls for their stability, eschewing any form of ballast. Some multihulls are designed to be as light-weight as possible while still maintaining structural integrity. They can be built with foam-filled flotation chambers and some modern trimarans are rated as unsinkable, meaning that, should every crew compartment be completely filled with water, the hull itself has sufficient buoyancy to remain afloat.\nA multihull optimized for light weight (at the expense of cruising amenities and storage for food and other supplies), combined with the absence of ballast can result in performance gains in terms of acceleration, top speed, and manoeuvrability.\nThe lack of ballast makes it much easier to get a lightweight multihull on plane, reducing its wetted surface area and thus its drag. Reduced overall weight means a reduced draft, with a much reduced underwater profile. This, in turn, results directly in reduced wetted surface area and drag. Without a ballast keel, multihulls can go in shallow waters where monohulls can not.\nThere are trade-offs, however, in multihull design. A well designed ballasted boat can recover from a capsize, even from turning over completely. Righting a multihull that has gotten upside down is difficult in any case and impossible without help unless the boat is small or carries special equipment for the purpose. Multihulls often prove more difficult to tack, since the reduced weight leads directly to reduced momentum, causing multihulls to more quickly lose speed when headed into the wind. Also, structural integrity is much easier to achieve in a one piece monohull than in a two or three piece multihull whose connecting structure must be substantial and well connected to the hulls.\nAll these hull types may also be manufactured as, or outfitted with, hydrofoils.\nKeel.\nAll vessels have a keel, it is the backbone of the hull. In traditional construction, it is the structure upon which all else depends. Modern monocoque designs include a virtual keel. Even multihulls have keels. On a sailboat, the word \"keel\" is also used to refer to the area that is added to the hull to improve its lateral plane. The lateral plane is what prevents leeway and allows sailing towards the wind. This can be an external piece or a part of the hull.\nMost monohulls larger than a dinghy require built-in ballast. Depending on the design of the boat, ballast may be 20 to 50 percent of the displacement. The ballast is often integrated into their keels as large masses of lead or cast iron. This secures the ballast and gets it as low as possible to improve its effectiveness. External keels are cast in the shape of the keel. A monohull's keel is made effective by a combination of weight, depth, and length.\nMost modern monohull boats have fin keels, which are heavy and deep, but short in relation to the hull length. More traditional yachts carried a full keel which is generally half or more of the length of the boat. A recent feature is a winged keel, which is short and shallow, but carries a lot of weight in two \"wings\" which run sideways from the main part of the keel. Even more recent is the concept of canting keels, designed to move the weight at the bottom of a sailboat to the upwind side, allowing the boat to carry more sails. A twin keel has the benefit of a shallower draft and can allow the boat to stand on dry land.\nMultihulls, on the other hand, have minimal need for such ballast, as they depend on the geometry of their design, the wide base of their multiple hulls, for their stability. Designers of performance multihulls, such as the Open 60's, go to great lengths to reduce overall boat weight as much as possible. This leads some to comment that designing a multihull is similar to designing an aircraft.\nA centreboard or daggerboard is retractable lightweight keel which can be pulled up in shallow water.\nMast.\nOn small sailboats, masts may be \"stepped\" (put in place) with the bottom end in a receptacle that is supported above the keel of the boat or on the deck or other superstructure that allows the mast to be raised at a hinge point until it is erect. Some masts are supported solely at the keel and laterally at the deck and are called \"unstayed\". Most masts rely in part or entirely (for those stepped on the deck) on standing rigging, supporting them side-to-side and fore-and aft to hold them up. Masts over may require a crane and are typically stepped on the keel through any cabin or other superstructure.\nAuxiliary propulsion.\nMany sailboats have an alternate means of propulsion, in case the wind dies or where close maneuvering under sail is impractical. The smallest boats may use a paddle; bigger ones may have oars; still others may employ an outboard motor, mounted on the transom; still others may have an inboard engine.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It also funded a highway safety improvement program, and permitted states for the first time in U.S. history to use Highway Trust Fund money for mass transit.\nLegislative history.\nBeginning in 1964, Congress passed a new highway aid act every two years, authorizing new expenditures and making changes to federal highway policies.\nThe Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968 and the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970 had authorized states to issue contracts for construction of the Interstate Highway System and urban and rural primary and secondary roads through June 30, 1974. It also provided funds for these contracts. Congress again attempted to pass legislation (the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1972) in 1972. However, the bill died after a House\u2013Senate conference committee was unable to agree whether to allow Highway Trust Funds to be used for mass transit. Another controversial issue was whether to require the District of Columbia to build the controversial Three Sisters Bridge.\nTwo important personnel changes occurred in the House after the failure of this legislation. Federal elections for the House and Senate were held in November 1972. First, Democratic Representative William M. Colmer declined to run for office again. He was replaced as chair of the House Rules Committee by the much more liberal Democratic Representative Ray Madden. Second, the death of Democratic Representative Hale Boggs, the House Majority Leader, in a plane crash in Alaska on October 16, 1972, elevated Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill to that position when the new 93rd Congress convened in January 1973.\nCongressional action.\nWith federal highway aid to the state scheduled to run out on June 30, 1973, work on a new highway bill began almost immediately in the new Congress.\nIn the Senate, mass transit advocates won a major victory. On March 14, the Senate voted to give states the authority to use up to $850 million of Highway Trust Fund money in both 1973 and 1974 for the expansion or construction of mass transit. The vote was a close 49-to-44. The Senate bill also proposed spending $18 billion on highway and mass transit over three years, and included no money for highway safety or design improvement programs.\nThere was weaker support for mass transit spending in the House, however. In 1972, Representative Colmer had used his role as chair of the Rules Committee to block any floor amendments aimed at adding mass transit spending to the 1972 highway bill. But Colmer was gone, and Representative Madden was much more willing to allow changes to the bill to be made on the House floor. Few expected transit spending authorization to come from the House Public Works Committee, however. The committee was populated primarily by members of Congress from rural areas who wanted to expend money on highways and were not willing to devote funds to the construction of mass transit (which benefitted only cities). But there was much stronger support for mass transit spending in the House as a whole. Furthermore, the new Majority Leader, Tip O'Neill, was a strong supporter of mass transit, and Speaker of the House Carl Albert was willing to allow floor amendments on mass transit.\nTo help reduce the chances that members of the full House would drastically amend the legislation, for the first time in years the Public Works Committee voted on major provisions of the highway bill in open public session. Representative Glenn M. Anderson, Democrat from California, offered an amendment in committee to allow cities to use their $700-million per year share of funding for urban highways on mass transit. His motion was defeated. However, Texas Democrat Jim Wright offered an amendment which was successful: Cities awarded urban highway funds could cancel these highways and return the money to the Highway Trust Fund. They could then apply to the United States Treasury for an equal amount in general federal revenues (if available). Wright's amendment also permitted states to cancel non-critical interstate highway projects as well, return the funds, and receive general federal revenues in return.\nThe Public Works Committee reported its bill on April 5, 1973. The committee bill added to the Interstate Highway System. For the first time in many years, the bill did not contain very much language earmarking funds for or requiring states to build specific construction projects. It did contain, however, provisions requiring the Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a program on highway safety research and design improvement. The total cost of the bill was $25.9 billion over three years.\nAnderson submitted his mass transit amendment when the Public Works bill came up on the floor of the full House of Representatives in late April 1973. The House defeated his amendment by just 25 votes.\nThe contentious conference committee.\nA conference committee was appointed by the House and Senate in early June 1973 to reconcile the two pieces of legislation. The committee almost immediately deadlocked over the mass transit issue. Members of the Senate said states should be permitted to make up their own minds about transportation spending, while House members accused the Senate of \"raiding\" the Highway Trust Fund. While all of the Senate conferees were in favor of using highway funds for mass transit, only two of the nine House members supported this plan. Senate conferees offered a compromise, based on suggestions made by President Richard Nixon and Representative Donald H. Clausen (a Republican from California). Under this scheme, up to 20 percent of the highway trust funds raised by each state could be used either for highways or for mass transit (up to a total national limit of $800 million a year). Another $588 million would be earmarked for spending on urban highways. To pay for the mass transit program, $800 million in spending would be cut from the urban and rural primary and secondary road building program. The House conferees rejected the proposal by a vote of 5-to-4 (with one Democrat voting with the Republicans).\nOn other issues, the conferees were able to come to agreement much more easily. Although the House bill projected spending of $9 billion a year over three years and the Senate $7 billion a year over three years, but both sides agreed to cut spending down to $5 billion or $6 billion a year over three years. The Senate also agreed to ease requirements that states meet certain civil rights and environmental standards, which would allow a number of highway construction projects which had been held up to move forward.\nAfter two and a half weeks of negotiations, the conference committee was still deadlocked. Pressure was mounting on the House conferees, however. Some states were due to run out of highway construction funds on June 30, and the construction industry was pressing the House conferees to give way on the mass transit issue. Furthermore, the 1973 oil crisis was just beginning, causing a shortage of gasoline in the United States. The gas shortage also put pressure on the House conferees to approve funding for mass transit.\nWith the conference committee unable to report a bill, the Senate passed a continuing resolution on June 25 which would continue to fund highway construction in 30 states for four more months at 1970 levels. The House was reluctant to agree to such a measure, since it would only lead to higher pressure over time for a compromise on the mass transit issue. But with states running out of money, the House passed by voice vote a $1.5 billion highway aid continuing resolution.\nThe conference committee reached agreement on the mass transit issue on July 19, 1973. The key negotiators were Representative Jim Wright and Senator Lloyd Bentsen, both of Texas. The conference committee bill allowed states to use up to $200 million of fiscal year 1975's $800 million urban highway appropriation to purchases mass transit buses. In fiscal year 1976, states could divert up to the entire $800 million urban highway appropriation to mass transit (which now included not only buses but also rolling stock as well as rail construction). The conferees also agreed to bar states from canceling sections of their planned interstates to use the money for mass transit. Some issues were still unresolved, however. Conferees had not yet reached agreement on whether states could use highway trust funds for rail operations, whether to give precedence to funding for roads which connected with the interstates, or whether to include a highway safety program in the highway aid bill or pass it as a stand-alone bill. The issue of whether to expand the Interstate Highway System was also outstanding.\nA final Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1973 was reported out of conference committee on July 20. The conference committee had met 29 times over two months, an exceptionally high number of meetings and long period of time. On August 1, the Senate approved the conference report by a vote of 95-to-1. The House followed suit by voice vote on August 3.\nThe highway bill proved acceptable to President Nixon, and he signed the bill into law on August 13, 1973.\nAbout the act.\nThe legislation reauthorized the Federal-Aid Highway Act through the end of fiscal year 1976 (September 30, 1976). Appropriations were made for interstate highway construction through fiscal year 1979 (September 30, 1979).\nThe total cost of the legislation was $20 billion over fiscal years 1974, 1975, and 1976. The act included the following funding provisions:\nNew programs established by the act included:\nSpecific projects required by the act, although far less numerous than in previous legislation, included:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
