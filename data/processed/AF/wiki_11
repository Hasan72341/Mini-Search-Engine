These results, published by Kurt G\u00f6del in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The theorems are interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.\nThe first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e. an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system. Equivalently, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are false, but that are unprovably false within the system.\nThe second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.\nEmploying a diagonal argument, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems were among the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by Tarski's undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, Church's proof that Hilbert's \"Entscheidungsproblem\" is unsolvable, and Turing's theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem.\nFormal systems: completeness, consistency, and effective axiomatization.\nThe incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent and effectively axiomatized. Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called \"formal theories\". In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability \"within\" these systems, rather than about \"provability\" in an informal sense.\nThere are several properties that a formal system may have, including completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization. The incompleteness theorems show that systems which contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic cannot possess all three of these properties.\nEffective axiomatization.\nA formal system is said to be \"effectively axiomatized\" (also called \"effectively generated\") if its set of theorems is recursively enumerable. This means that there is a computer program that, in principle, could enumerate all the theorems of the system without listing any statements that are not theorems. Examples of effectively generated theories include Peano arithmetic and Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory (ZFC).\nThe theory known as true arithmetic consists of all true statements about the standard integers in the language of Peano arithmetic. This theory is consistent and complete, and contains a sufficient amount of arithmetic. However, it does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and thus does not satisfy the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorems.\nCompleteness.\nA set of axioms is (\"syntactically\", or \"negation\"-) complete if, for any statement in the axioms' language, that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms. This is the notion relevant for G\u00f6del's first Incompleteness theorem. It is not to be confused with \"semantic\" completeness, which means that the set of axioms proves all the semantic tautologies of the given language. In his completeness theorem (not to be confused with the incompleteness theorems described here), G\u00f6del proved that first-order logic is \"semantically\" complete. But it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first-order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.\nIn a system of mathematics, thinkers such as Hilbert believed that it was just a matter of time to find such an axiomatization that would allow one to either prove or disprove (by proving its negation) every mathematical formula.\nA formal system might be syntactically incomplete by design, as logics generally are. Or it may be incomplete simply because not all the necessary axioms have been discovered or included. For example, Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate is incomplete, because some statements in the language (such as the parallel postulate itself) can not be proved from the remaining axioms. Similarly, the theory of dense linear orders is not complete, but becomes complete with an extra axiom stating that there are no endpoints in the order. The continuum hypothesis is a statement in the language of ZFC that is not provable within ZFC, so ZFC is not complete. In this case, there is no obvious candidate for a new axiom that resolves the issue.\nThe theory of first-order Peano arithmetic seems consistent. Assuming this is indeed the case, note that it has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can encode enough arithmetic for the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorem. Thus by the first incompleteness theorem, Peano Arithmetic is not complete. The theorem gives an explicit example of a statement of arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable in Peano's arithmetic. Moreover, this statement is true in the usual model. In addition, no effectively axiomatized, consistent extension of Peano arithmetic can be complete.\nConsistency.\nA set of axioms is (simply) consistent if there is no statement such that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms, and \"inconsistent\" otherwise. That is to say, a consistent axiomatic system is one that is free from contradiction.\nPeano arithmetic is provably consistent from ZFC, but not from within itself. Similarly, ZFC is not provably consistent from within itself, but ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" proves ZFC is consistent because if \u03ba is the least such cardinal, then \"V\"\u03ba sitting inside the von Neumann universe is a model of ZFC, and a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model.\nIf one takes all statements in the language of Peano arithmetic as axioms, then this theory is complete, has a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can describe addition and multiplication. However, it is not consistent.\nAdditional examples of inconsistent theories arise from the paradoxes that result when the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is assumed in set theory.\nSystems which contain arithmetic.\nThe incompleteness theorems apply only to formal systems which are able to prove a sufficient collection of facts about the natural numbers. One sufficient collection is the set of theorems of Robinson arithmetic Q. Some systems, such as Peano arithmetic, can directly express statements about natural numbers. Others, such as ZFC set theory, are able to interpret statements about natural numbers into their language. Either of these options is appropriate for the incompleteness theorems.\nThe theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic is complete, consistent, and has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms. However it is not possible to encode the integers into this theory, and the theory cannot describe arithmetic of integers. A similar example is the theory of real closed fields, which is essentially equivalent to Tarski's axioms for Euclidean geometry. So Euclidean geometry itself (in Tarski's formulation) is an example of a complete, consistent, effectively axiomatized theory.\nThe system of Presburger arithmetic consists of a set of axioms for the natural numbers with just the addition operation (multiplication is omitted). Presburger arithmetic is complete, consistent, and recursively enumerable and can encode addition but not multiplication of natural numbers, showing that for G\u00f6del's theorems one needs the theory to encode not just addition but also multiplication.\nDan Willard\u00a0(2001) has studied some weak families of arithmetic systems which allow enough arithmetic as relations to formalise G\u00f6del numbering, but which are not strong enough to have multiplication as a function, and so fail to prove the second incompleteness theorem; that is to say, these systems are consistent and capable of proving their own consistency (see self-verifying theories).\nConflicting goals.\nIn choosing a set of axioms, one goal is to be able to prove as many correct results as possible, without proving any incorrect results. For example, we could imagine a set of true axioms which allow us to prove every true arithmetical claim about the natural numbers . In the standard system of first-order logic, an inconsistent set of axioms will prove every statement in its language (this is sometimes called the principle of explosion), and is thus automatically complete. A set of axioms that is both complete and consistent, however, proves a maximal set of non-contradictory theorems.\nThe pattern illustrated in the previous sections with Peano arithmetic, ZFC, and ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" cannot generally be broken. Here ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\" cannot from itself, be proved consistent. It is also not complete, as illustrated by the continuum hypothesis, which is unresolvable in ZFC + \"there exists an inaccessible cardinal\".\nThe first incompleteness theorem shows that, in formal systems that can express basic arithmetic, a complete and consistent finite list of axioms can never be created: each time an additional, consistent statement is added as an axiom, there are other true statements that still cannot be proved, even with the new axiom. If an axiom is ever added that makes the system complete, it does so at the cost of making the system inconsistent. It is not even possible for an infinite list of axioms to be complete, consistent, and effectively axiomatized.\nFirst incompleteness theorem.\nG\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem first appeared as \"Theorem VI\" in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\". The hypotheses of the theorem were improved shortly thereafter by J. Barkley Rosser\u00a0(1936) using Rosser's trick. The resulting theorem (incorporating Rosser's improvement) may be paraphrased in English as follows, where \"formal system\" includes the assumption that the system is effectively generated.\nFirst Incompleteness Theorem: \"Any consistent formal system F within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e. there are statements of the language of F which can neither be proved nor disproved in F.\" (Raatikainen 2020)\nThe unprovable statement \"G\"\"F\" referred to by the theorem is often referred to as \"the G\u00f6del sentence\" for the system F. The proof constructs a particular G\u00f6del sentence for the system F, but there are infinitely many statements in the language of the system that share the same properties, such as the conjunction of the G\u00f6del sentence and any logically valid sentence.\nEach effectively generated system has its own G\u00f6del sentence. It is possible to define a larger system F'\u00a0that contains the whole of F plus \"G\"\"F\" as an additional axiom. This will not result in a complete system, because G\u00f6del's theorem will also apply to F', and thus F' also cannot be complete. In this case, \"G\"\"F\" is indeed a theorem in F', because it is an axiom. Because \"G\"\"F\" states only that it is not provable in F, no contradiction is presented by its provability within F'. However, because the incompleteness theorem applies to F', there will be a new G\u00f6del statement \"G\"\"F\"\u2009' for F', showing that F' is also incomplete. \"G\"\"F\"\u2009' will differ from \"G\"\"F\" in that \"G\"\"F\"\u2009' will refer to F', rather than\u00a0F.\nSyntactic form of the G\u00f6del sentence.\nThe G\u00f6del sentence is designed to refer, indirectly, to itself. The sentence states that, when a particular sequence of steps is used to construct another sentence, that constructed sentence will not be provable in F. However, the sequence of steps is such that the constructed sentence turns out to be \"G\"\"F\" itself. In this way, the G\u00f6del sentence \"G\"\"F\" indirectly states its own unprovability within F.\nTo prove the first incompleteness theorem, G\u00f6del demonstrated that the notion of provability within a system could be expressed purely in terms of arithmetical functions that operate on G\u00f6del numbers of sentences of the system. Therefore, the system, which can prove certain facts about numbers, can also indirectly prove facts about its own statements, provided that it is effectively generated. Questions about the provability of statements within the system are represented as questions about the arithmetical properties of numbers themselves, which would be decidable by the system if it were complete.\nThus, although the G\u00f6del sentence refers indirectly to sentences of the system F, when read as an arithmetical statement the G\u00f6del sentence directly refers only to natural numbers. It asserts that no natural number has a particular property, where that property is given by a primitive recursive relation . As such, the G\u00f6del sentence can be written in the language of arithmetic with a simple syntactic form. In particular, it can be expressed as a formula in the language of arithmetic consisting of a number of leading universal quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free body (these formulas are at level formula_1 of the arithmetical hierarchy). Via the MRDP theorem, the G\u00f6del sentence can be re-written as a statement that a particular polynomial in many variables with integer coefficients never takes the value zero when integers are substituted for its variables .\nTruth of the G\u00f6del sentence.\nThe first incompleteness theorem shows that the G\u00f6del sentence \"G\"\"F\" of an appropriate formal theory F is unprovable in F. Because, when interpreted as a statement about arithmetic, this unprovability is exactly what the sentence (indirectly) asserts, the G\u00f6del sentence is, in fact, true (; also see ). For this reason, the sentence \"G\"\"F\" is often said to be \"true but unprovable.\" . However, since the G\u00f6del sentence cannot itself formally specify its intended interpretation, the truth of the sentence \"G\"\"F\" may only be arrived at via a meta-analysis from outside the system. In general, this meta-analysis can be carried out within the weak formal system known as primitive recursive arithmetic, which proves the implication \"Con\"(\"F\")\u2192\"G\"F, where \"Con\"(\"F\") is a canonical sentence asserting the consistency of F (, ).\nAlthough the G\u00f6del sentence of a consistent theory is true as a statement about the intended interpretation of arithmetic, the G\u00f6del sentence will be false in some nonstandard models of arithmetic, as a consequence of G\u00f6del's completeness theorem . That theorem shows that, when a sentence is independent of a theory, the theory will have models in which the sentence is true and models in which the sentence is false. As described earlier, the G\u00f6del sentence of a system F is an arithmetical statement which claims that no number exists with a particular property. The incompleteness theorem shows that this claim will be independent of the system F, and the truth of the G\u00f6del sentence follows from the fact that no standard natural number has the property in question. Any model in which the G\u00f6del sentence is false must contain some element which satisfies the property within that model. Such a model must be \"nonstandard\" \u2013 it must contain elements that do not correspond to any standard natural number (, ).\nRelationship with the liar paradox.\nG\u00f6del specifically cites Richard's paradox and the liar paradox as semantical analogues to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\". The liar paradox is the sentence \"This sentence is false.\" An analysis of the liar sentence shows that it cannot be true (for then, as it asserts, it is false), nor can it be false (for then, it is true). A G\u00f6del sentence G for a system F makes a similar assertion to the liar sentence, but with truth replaced by provability: G says \"G is not provable in the system F.\" The analysis of the truth and provability of G is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.\nIt is not possible to replace \"not provable\" with \"false\" in a G\u00f6del sentence because the predicate \"Q is the G\u00f6del number of a false formula\" cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski's undefinability theorem, was discovered independently both by G\u00f6del, when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem, and by the theorem's namesake, Alfred Tarski.\nExtensions of G\u00f6del's original result.\nCompared to the theorems stated in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper, many contemporary statements of the incompleteness theorems are more general in two ways. These generalized statements are phrased to apply to a broader class of systems, and they are phrased to incorporate weaker consistency assumptions.\nG\u00f6del demonstrated the incompleteness of the system of \"Principia Mathematica\", a particular system of arithmetic, but a parallel demonstration could be given for any effective system of a certain expressiveness. G\u00f6del commented on this fact in the introduction to his paper, but restricted the proof to one system for concreteness. In modern statements of the theorem, it is common to state the effectiveness and expressiveness conditions as hypotheses for the incompleteness theorem, so that it is not limited to any particular formal system. The terminology used to state these conditions was not yet developed in 1931 when G\u00f6del published his results.\nG\u00f6del's original statement and proof of the incompleteness theorem requires the assumption that the system is not just consistent but \"\u03c9-consistent\". A system is \u03c9-consistent if it is not \u03c9-inconsistent, and is \u03c9-inconsistent if there is a predicate P such that for every specific natural number m the system proves ~\"P\"(\"m\"), and yet the system also proves that there exists a natural number n such that P(n). That is, the system says that a number with property P exists while denying that it has any specific value. The \u03c9-consistency of a system implies its consistency, but consistency does not imply \u03c9-consistency. J. Barkley Rosser\u00a0(1936) strengthened the incompleteness theorem by finding a variation of the proof (Rosser's trick) that only requires the system to be consistent, rather than \u03c9-consistent. This is mostly of technical interest, because all true formal theories of arithmetic (theories whose axioms are all true statements about natural numbers) are \u03c9-consistent, and thus G\u00f6del's theorem as originally stated applies to them. The stronger version of the incompleteness theorem that only assumes consistency, rather than \u03c9-consistency, is now commonly known as G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem and as the G\u00f6del\u2013Rosser theorem.\nSecond incompleteness theorem.\nFor each formal system F containing basic arithmetic, it is possible to canonically define a formula Cons(F) expressing the consistency of F. This formula expresses the property that \"there does not exist a natural number coding a formal derivation within the system F whose conclusion is a syntactic contradiction.\" The syntactic contradiction is often taken to be \"0=1\", in which case Cons(F) states \"there is no natural number that codes a derivation of '0=1' from the axioms of F.\"\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem shows that, under general assumptions, this canonical consistency statement Cons(F) will not be provable in F. The theorem first appeared as \"Theorem XI\" in G\u00f6del's 1931 paper \"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\". In the following statement, the term \"formalized system\" also includes an assumption that F is effectively axiomatized. This theorem states that for any consistent system \"F\" within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of \"F\" cannot be proved in \"F\" itself. This theorem is stronger than the first incompleteness theorem because the statement constructed in the first incompleteness theorem does not directly express the consistency of the system. The proof of the second incompleteness theorem is obtained by formalizing the proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system F itself.\nExpressing consistency.\nThere is a technical subtlety in the second incompleteness theorem regarding the method of expressing the consistency of F as a formula in the language of F. There are many ways to express the consistency of a system, and not all of them lead to the same result. The formula Cons(F) from the second incompleteness theorem is a particular expression of consistency.\nOther formalizations of the claim that F is consistent may be inequivalent in F, and some may even be provable. For example, first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can prove that \"the largest consistent subset of PA\" is consistent. But, because PA is consistent, the largest consistent subset of PA is just PA, so in this sense PA \"proves that it is consistent\". What PA does not prove is that the largest consistent subset of PA is, in fact, the whole of PA. (The term \"largest consistent subset of PA\" is meant here to be the largest consistent initial segment of the axioms of PA under some particular effective enumeration.)\nThe Hilbert\u2013Bernays conditions.\nThe standard proof of the second incompleteness theorem assumes that the provability predicate \"Prov\"A(\"P\") satisfies the Hilbert\u2013Bernays provability conditions. Letting #(\"P\") represent the G\u00f6del number of a formula P, the provability conditions say:\nThere are systems, such as Robinson arithmetic, which are strong enough to meet the assumptions of the first incompleteness theorem, but which do not prove the Hilbert\u2013Bernays conditions. Peano arithmetic, however, is strong enough to verify these conditions, as are all theories stronger than Peano arithmetic.\nImplications for consistency proofs.\nG\u00f6del's second incompleteness theorem also implies that a system \"F\"1 satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any system \"F\"2 that proves the consistency of \"F\"1. This is because such a system \"F\"1 can prove that if \"F\"2 proves the consistency of \"F\"1, then \"F\"1 is in fact consistent. For the claim that \"F\"1 is consistent has form \"for all numbers n, n has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in \"F\"1\". If \"F\"1 were in fact inconsistent, then \"F\"2 would prove for some n that n is the code of a contradiction in \"F\"1. But if \"F\"2 also proved that \"F\"1 is consistent (that is, that there is no such n), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in \"F\"1 to show that if \"F\"2 is consistent, then \"F\"1 is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, \"F\"1 does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of \"F\"2 either.\nThis corollary of the second incompleteness theorem shows that there is no hope of proving, for example, the consistency of Peano arithmetic using any finitistic means that can be formalized in a system the consistency of which is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA). For example, the system of primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), which is widely accepted as an accurate formalization of finitistic mathematics, is provably consistent in PA. Thus PRA cannot prove the consistency of PA. This fact is generally seen to imply that Hilbert's program, which aimed to justify the use of \"ideal\" (infinitistic) mathematical principles in the proofs of \"real\" (finitistic) mathematical statements by giving a finitistic proof that the ideal principles are consistent, cannot be carried out.\nThe corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would provide no interesting information if a system F proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of F in F would give us no clue as to whether F is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of F would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a system F in some system F' that is in some sense less doubtful than F itself, for example, weaker than F. For many naturally occurring theories F and F', such as F = Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory and F' = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of F' is provable in F, and thus F' cannot prove the consistency of F by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.\nThe second incompleteness theorem does not rule out altogether the possibility of proving the consistency of a different system with different axioms. For example, Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic in a different system that includes an axiom asserting that the ordinal called \"\u03b5\"0 is wellfounded; see Gentzen's consistency proof. Gentzen's theorem spurred the development of ordinal analysis in proof theory.\nExamples of undecidable statements.\nThere are two distinct senses of the word \"undecidable\" in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the proof-theoretic sense used in relation to G\u00f6del's theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system. The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set (see undecidable problem).\nBecause of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term independent is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the \"neither provable nor refutable\" sense.\nUndecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the truth value of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called \"absolutely undecidable\" statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point in the philosophy of mathematics.\nThe combined work of G\u00f6del and Paul Cohen has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted in ZFC (the standard axiomatization of set theory), and the axiom of choice can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF (which is all the ZFC axioms \"except\" the axiom of choice). These results do not require the incompleteness theorem. G\u00f6del proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved from ZFC.\n showed that the Whitehead problem in group theory is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.\nGregory Chaitin produced undecidable statements in algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. Chaitin's incompleteness theorem states that for any system that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound c such that no specific number can be proved in that system to have Kolmogorov complexity greater than c. While G\u00f6del's theorem is related to the liar paradox, Chaitin's result is related to Berry's paradox.\nUndecidable statements provable in larger systems.\nThese are natural mathematical equivalents of the G\u00f6del \"true but undecidable\" sentence. They can be proved in a larger system which is generally accepted as a valid form of reasoning, but are undecidable in a more limited system such as Peano Arithmetic.\nIn 1977, Paris and Harrington proved that the Paris\u2013Harrington principle, a version of the infinite Ramsey theorem, is undecidable in (first-order) Peano arithmetic, but can be proved in the stronger system of second-order arithmetic. Kirby and Paris later showed that Goodstein's theorem, a statement about sequences of natural numbers somewhat simpler than the Paris\u2013Harrington principle, is also undecidable in Peano arithmetic.\nKruskal's tree theorem, which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from Peano arithmetic but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal's tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system ATR0 codifying the principles acceptable based on a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism. The related but more general graph minor theorem (2003) has consequences for computational complexity theory.\nRelationship with computability.\nThe incompleteness theorem is closely related to several results about undecidable sets in recursion theory.\n presented a proof of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem using basic results of computability theory. One such result shows that the halting problem is undecidable: no computer program can correctly determine, given any program P as input, whether P eventually halts when run with a particular given input. Kleene showed that the existence of a complete effective system of arithmetic with certain consistency properties would force the halting problem to be decidable, a contradiction. This method of proof has also been presented by ; ; and .\n explains how Matiyasevich's solution to Hilbert's 10th problem can be used to obtain a proof to G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. Matiyasevich proved that there is no algorithm that, given a multivariate polynomial \"p\"(\"x\"1, \"x\"2...,\"x\"k) with integer coefficients, determines whether there is an integer solution to the equation p = 0. Because polynomials with integer coefficients, and integers themselves, are directly expressible in the language of arithmetic, if a multivariate integer polynomial equation p = 0 does have a solution in the integers then any sufficiently strong system of arithmetic T will prove this. Moreover, suppose the system T is \u03c9-consistent. In that case, it will never prove that a particular polynomial equation has a solution when there is no solution in the integers. Thus, if T were complete and \u03c9-consistent, it would be possible to determine algorithmically whether a polynomial equation has a solution by merely enumerating proofs of T until either \"p has a solution\" or \"p has no solution\" is found, in contradiction to Matiyasevich's theorem. Hence it follows that T cannot be \u03c9-consistent and complete. Moreover, for each consistent effectively generated system T, it is possible to effectively generate a multivariate polynomial p over the integers such that the equation p = 0 has no solutions over the integers, but the lack of solutions cannot be proved in T.\n shows how the existence of recursively inseparable sets can be used to prove the first incompleteness theorem. This proof is often extended to show that systems such as Peano arithmetic are essentially undecidable.\nChaitin's incompleteness theorem gives a different method of producing independent sentences, based on Kolmogorov complexity. Like the proof presented by Kleene that was mentioned above, Chaitin's theorem only applies to theories with the additional property that all their axioms are true in the standard model of the natural numbers. G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem is distinguished by its applicability to consistent theories that nonetheless include false statements in the standard model; these theories are known as \u03c9-inconsistent.\nProof sketch for the first theorem.\nThe proof by contradiction has three essential parts. To begin, choose a formal system that meets the proposed criteria:\nArithmetization of syntax.\nThe main problem in fleshing out the proof described above is that it seems at first that to construct a statement p that is equivalent to \"p cannot be proved\", p would somehow have to contain a reference to p, which could easily give rise to an infinite regress. G\u00f6del's technique is to show that statements can be matched with numbers (often called the arithmetization of syntax) in such a way that \"proving a statement\" can be replaced with \"testing whether a number has a given property\". This allows a self-referential formula to be constructed in a way that avoids any infinite regress of definitions. The same technique was later used by Alan Turing in his work on the \"Entscheidungsproblem\".\nIn simple terms, a method can be devised so that every formula or statement that can be formulated in the system gets a unique number, called its G\u00f6del number, in such a way that it is possible to mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and G\u00f6del numbers. The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed. A simple example is how English can be stored as a sequence of numbers for each letter and then combined into a single larger number:\n* The word codice_1 is encoded as 104-101-108-108-111 in ASCII, which can be converted into the number 104101108108111.\n* The logical statement codice_2 is encoded as 120-061-121-032-061-062-032-121-061-120 in ASCII, which can be converted into the number 120061121032061062032121061120.\nIn principle, proving a statement true or false can be shown to be equivalent to proving that the number matching the statement does or does not have a given property. Because the formal system is strong enough to support reasoning about \"numbers in general\", it can support reasoning about \"numbers that represent formulae and statements\" as well. Crucially, because the system can support reasoning about \"properties of numbers\", the results are equivalent to reasoning about \"provability of their equivalent statements\".\nConstruction of a statement about \"provability\".\nHaving shown that in principle the system can indirectly make statements about provability, by analyzing properties of those numbers representing statements it is now possible to show how to create a statement that actually does this.\nA formula \"F\"(\"x\") that contains exactly one free variable x is called a \"statement form\" or \"class-sign\". As soon as x is replaced by a specific number, the statement form turns into a \"bona fide\" statement, and it is then either provable in the system, or not. For certain formulas one can show that for every natural number n, &amp;NoBreak;&amp;NoBreak; is true if and only if it can be proved (the precise requirement in the original proof is weaker, but for the proof sketch this will suffice). In particular, this is true for every specific arithmetic operation between a finite number of natural numbers, such as \"2\u00d73 = 6\".\nStatement forms themselves are not statements and therefore cannot be proved or disproved. But every statement form \"F\"(\"x\") can be assigned a G\u00f6del number denoted by G(\"F\"). The choice of the free variable used in the form F(x) is not relevant to the assignment of the G\u00f6del number G(\"F\").\nThe notion of provability itself can also be encoded by G\u00f6del numbers, in the following way: since a proof is a list of statements which obey certain rules, the G\u00f6del number of a proof can be defined. Now, for every statement p, one may ask whether a number x is the G\u00f6del number of its proof. The relation between the G\u00f6del number of p and x, the potential G\u00f6del number of its proof, is an arithmetical relation between two numbers. Therefore, there is a statement form \"Bew\"(\"y\") that uses this arithmetical relation to state that a G\u00f6del number of a proof of y exists:\n\"Bew\"(\"y\") = \u2203 \"x\" (y is the G\u00f6del number of a formula and x is the G\u00f6del number of a proof of the formula encoded by y).\nThe name Bew is short for \"beweisbar\", the German word for \"provable\"; this name was originally used by G\u00f6del to denote the provability formula just described. Note that \"\"Bew\"(\"y\")\" is merely an abbreviation that represents a particular, very long, formula in the original language of T; the string \"Bew\" itself is not claimed to be part of this language.\nAn important feature of the formula \"Bew\"(\"y\") is that if a statement p is provable in the system then \"Bew\"(G(\"p\")) is also provable. This is because any proof of p would have a corresponding G\u00f6del number, the existence of which causes Bew(G(\"p\")) to be satisfied.\nDiagonalization.\nThe next step in the proof is to obtain a statement which, indirectly, asserts its own unprovability. Although G\u00f6del constructed this statement directly, the existence of at least one such statement follows from the diagonal lemma, which says that for any sufficiently strong formal system and any statement form F there is a statement p such that the system proves\n\"p\" \u2194 \"F\"(G(\"p\")).\nBy letting F be the negation of \"Bew\"(\"x\"), we obtain the theorem\n\"p\" \u2194 ~\"Bew\"(G(\"p\"))\nand the p defined by this roughly states that its own G\u00f6del number is the G\u00f6del number of an unprovable formula.\nThe statement p is not literally equal to ~\"Bew\"(G(\"p\")); rather, p states that if a certain calculation is performed, the resulting G\u00f6del number will be that of an unprovable statement. But when this calculation is performed, the resulting G\u00f6del number turns out to be the G\u00f6del number of p itself. This is similar to the following sentence in English:\n\", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.\", when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.\nThis sentence does not directly refer to itself, but when the stated transformation is made the original sentence is obtained as a result, and thus this sentence indirectly asserts its own unprovability. The proof of the diagonal lemma employs a similar method.\nNow, assume that the axiomatic system is \u03c9-consistent, and let p be the statement obtained in the previous section.\nIf p were provable, then \"Bew\"(G(\"p\")) would be provable, as argued above. But p asserts the negation of \"Bew\"(G(\"p\")). Thus the system would be inconsistent, proving both a statement and its negation. This contradiction shows that p cannot be provable.\nIf the negation of p were provable, then \"Bew\"(G(\"p\")) would be provable (because p was constructed to be equivalent to the negation of \"Bew\"(G(\"p\"))). However, for each specific number x, x cannot be the G\u00f6del number of the proof of p, because p is not provable (from the previous paragraph). Thus on one hand the system proves there is a number with a certain property (that it is the G\u00f6del number of the proof of p), but on the other hand, for every specific number x, we can prove that it does not have this property. This is impossible in an \u03c9-consistent system. Thus the negation of p is not provable.\nThus the statement p is undecidable in our axiomatic system: it can neither be proved nor disproved within the system.\nIn fact, to show that p is not provable only requires the assumption that the system is consistent. The stronger assumption of \u03c9-consistency is required to show that the negation of p is not provable. Thus, if p is constructed for a particular system:\nIf one tries to \"add the missing axioms\" to avoid the incompleteness of the system, then one has to add either p or \"not p\" as axioms. But then the definition of \"being a G\u00f6del number of a proof\" of a statement changes. which means that the formula \"Bew\"(\"x\") is now different. Thus when we apply the diagonal lemma to this new Bew, we obtain a new statement p, different from the previous one, which will be undecidable in the new system if it is \u03c9-consistent.\nProof via Berry's paradox.\n sketches an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry's paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula. A similar proof method was independently discovered by Saul Kripke. Boolos's proof proceeds by constructing, for any computably enumerable set S of true sentences of arithmetic, another sentence which is true but not contained in S. This gives the first incompleteness theorem as a corollary. According to Boolos, this proof is interesting because it provides a \"different sort of reason\" for the incompleteness of effective, consistent theories of arithmetic.\nComputer verified proofs.\nThe incompleteness theorems are among a relatively small number of nontrivial theorems that have been transformed into formalized theorems that can be completely verified by proof assistant software. G\u00f6del's original proofs of the incompleteness theorems, like most mathematical proofs, were written in natural language intended for human readers.\nComputer-verified proofs of versions of the first incompleteness theorem were announced by Natarajan Shankar in 1986 using Nqthm , by Russell O'Connor in 2003 using Rocq (previously known as \"Coq\") and by John Harrison in 2009 using HOL Light . A computer-verified proof of both incompleteness theorems was announced by Lawrence Paulson in 2013 using Isabelle .\nProof sketch for the second theorem.\nThe main difficulty in proving the second incompleteness theorem is to show that various facts about provability used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be formalized within a system S using a formal predicate \"P\" for provability. Once this is done, the second incompleteness theorem follows by formalizing the entire proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system S itself.\nLet p stand for the undecidable sentence constructed above, and assume for purposes of obtaining a contradiction that the consistency of the system S can be proved from within the system S itself. This is equivalent to proving the statement \"System S is consistent\". \nNow consider the statement c, where c = \"If the system S is consistent, then p is not provable\". The proof of sentence c can be formalized within the system S, and therefore the statement c, \"p is not provable\", (or identically, \"not \"P\"(\"p\")\") can be proved in the system S.\nObserve then, that if we can prove that the system S is consistent (i.e. the statement in the hypothesis of c), then we have proved that p is not provable. But this is a contradiction since by the 1st Incompleteness Theorem, this sentence (i.e. what is implied in the sentence c, \"\"p\" is not provable\") is what we construct to be unprovable. Notice that this is why we require formalizing the first Incompleteness Theorem in S: to prove the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem, we obtain a contradiction with the 1st Incompleteness Theorem which can do only by showing that the theorem holds in S. So we cannot prove that the system S is consistent. And the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem statement follows.\nDiscussion and implications.\nThe incompleteness results affect the philosophy of mathematics, particularly versions of formalism, which use a single system of formal logic to define their principles.\nConsequences for logicism and Hilbert's second problem.\nThe incompleteness theorem is sometimes thought to have severe consequences for the program of logicism proposed by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, which aimed to define the natural numbers in terms of logic. Bob Hale and Crispin Wright argue that it is not a problem for logicism because the incompleteness theorems apply equally to first-order logic as they do to arithmetic. They argue that only those who believe that the natural numbers are to be defined in terms of first order logic have this problem.\nMany logicians believe that G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems struck a fatal blow to David Hilbert's second problem, which asked for a finitary consistency proof for mathematics. The second incompleteness theorem, in particular, is often viewed as making the problem impossible. Not all mathematicians agree with this analysis, however, and the status of Hilbert's second problem is not yet decided (see \"Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem\").\nMinds and machines.\nAuthors including the philosopher J. R. Lucas and physicist Roger Penrose have debated what, if anything, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems imply about human intelligence. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church\u2013Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems would apply to it.\n suggested that while G\u00f6del's theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. Assuming that it is consistent, either its consistency cannot be proved or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.\n has proposed that the concept of mathematical \"knowability\" should be based on computational complexity rather than logical decidability. He writes that \"when \"knowability\" is interpreted by modern standards, namely via computational complexity, the G\u00f6del phenomena are very much with us.\"\nDouglas Hofstadter, in his books \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" and \"I Am a Strange Loop\", cites G\u00f6del's theorems as an example of what he calls a \"strange loop\", a hierarchical, self-referential structure existing within an axiomatic formal system. He argues that this is the same kind of structure that gives rise to consciousness, the sense of \"I\", in the human mind. While the self-reference in G\u00f6del's theorem comes from the G\u00f6del sentence asserting its unprovability within the formal system of Principia Mathematica, the self-reference in the human mind comes from how the brain abstracts and categorises stimuli into \"symbols\", or groups of neurons which respond to concepts, in what is effectively also a formal system, eventually giving rise to symbols modeling the concept of the very entity doing the perception. Hofstadter argues that a strange loop in a sufficiently complex formal system can give rise to a \"downward\" or \"upside-down\" causality, a situation in which the normal hierarchy of cause-and-effect is flipped upside-down. In the case of G\u00f6del's theorem, this manifests, in short, as the following:\n Merely from knowing the formula's meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically \"upwards\" from the axioms. This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing. Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture says and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false. \nIn the case of the mind, a far more complex formal system, this \"downward causality\" manifests, in Hofstadter's view, as the ineffable human instinct that the causality of our minds lies on the high level of desires, concepts, personalities, thoughts, and ideas, rather than on the low level of interactions between neurons or even fundamental particles, even though according to physics the latter seems to possess the causal power.\n There is thus a curious upside-downness to our normal human way of perceiving the world: we are built to perceive \u201cbig stuff\u201d rather than \u201csmall stuff\u201d, even though the domain of the tiny seems to be where the actual motors driving reality reside. \nParaconsistent logic.\nAlthough G\u00f6del's theorems are usually studied in the context of classical logic, they also have a role in the study of paraconsistent logic and of inherently contradictory statements (\"dialetheia\"). Priest\u00a0(1984, 2006) argues that replacing the notion of formal proof in G\u00f6del's theorem with the usual notion of informal proof can be used to show that naive mathematics is inconsistent, and uses this as evidence for dialetheism. The cause of this inconsistency is the inclusion of a truth predicate for a system within the language of the system. gives a more mixed appraisal of the applications of G\u00f6del's theorems to dialetheism.\nAppeals to the incompleteness theorems in other fields.\nAppeals and analogies are sometimes made to the incompleteness of theorems in support of arguments that go beyond mathematics and logic. Several authors have commented negatively on such extensions and interpretations, including , , ; and .\n and , for example, quote from Rebecca Goldstein's comments on the disparity between G\u00f6del's avowed Platonism and the anti-realist uses to which his ideas are sometimes put. criticize R\u00e9gis Debray's invocation of the theorem in the context of sociology; Debray has defended this use as metaphorical (ibid.).\nHistory.\nAfter G\u00f6del published his proof of the completeness theorem as his doctoral thesis in 1929, he turned to a second problem for his habilitation. His original goal was to obtain a positive solution to Hilbert's second problem. At the time, theories of natural numbers and real numbers similar to second-order arithmetic were known as \"analysis\", while theories of natural numbers alone were known as \"arithmetic\".\nG\u00f6del was not the only person working on the consistency problem. Ackermann had published a flawed consistency proof for analysis in 1925, in which he attempted to use the method of \u03b5-substitution originally developed by Hilbert. Later that year, von Neumann was able to correct the proof for a system of arithmetic without any axioms of induction. By 1928, Ackermann had communicated a modified proof to Bernays; this modified proof led Hilbert to announce his belief in 1929 that the consistency of arithmetic had been demonstrated and that a consistent proof of analysis would likely soon follow. After the publication of the incompleteness theorems showed that Ackermann's modified proof must be erroneous, von Neumann produced a concrete example showing that its main technique was unsound.\nIn the course of his research, G\u00f6del discovered that, although a sentence asserting its falsehood leads to paradox, a sentence that asserts its non-provability does not. In particular, G\u00f6del was aware of the result now called Tarski's indefinability theorem, although he never published it. G\u00f6del announced his first incompleteness theorem to Carnap, Feigel, and Waismann on August 26, 1930; all four would attend the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences, a key conference in K\u00f6nigsberg the following week.\nAnnouncement.\nThe 1930 K\u00f6nigsberg conference was a joint meeting of three academic societies, with many of the key logicians of the time in attendance. Carnap, Heyting, and von Neumann delivered one-hour addresses on the mathematical philosophies of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism, respectively. The conference also included Hilbert's retirement address, as he was leaving his position at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. Hilbert used the speech to argue his belief that all mathematical problems can be solved. He ended his address by saying,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;For the mathematician there is no \"Ignorabimus\", and, in my opinion, not at all for natural science either. ... The true reason why [no one] has succeeded in finding an unsolvable problem is, in my opinion, that there is no unsolvable problem. In contrast to the foolish \"Ignorabimus\", our credo avers: We must know. We shall know!\nThis speech quickly became known as a summary of Hilbert's beliefs on mathematics (its final six words, \"Wir m\u00fcssen wissen. Wir werden wissen!\", were used as Hilbert's epitaph in 1943). Although G\u00f6del was likely in attendance for Hilbert's address, the two never met face to face.\nG\u00f6del announced his first incompleteness theorem at a roundtable discussion session on the third day of the conference. The announcement drew little attention apart from that of von Neumann, who pulled G\u00f6del aside for a conversation. Later that year, working independently with knowledge of the first incompleteness theorem, von Neumann obtained a proof of the second incompleteness theorem, which he announced to G\u00f6del in a letter dated November 20, 1930. G\u00f6del had independently obtained the second incompleteness theorem and included it in his submitted manuscript, which was received by \"Monatshefte f\u00fcr Mathematik\" on November 17, 1930.\nG\u00f6del's paper was published in the \"Monatshefte\" in 1931 under the title \"\u00dcber formal unentscheidbare S\u00e4tze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I\" (\"On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I\"). As the title implies, G\u00f6del originally planned to publish a second part of the paper in the next volume of the \"Monatshefte\"; the prompt acceptance of the first paper was one reason he changed his plans.\nGeneralization and acceptance.\nG\u00f6del gave a series of lectures on his theorems at Princeton in 1933\u20131934 to an audience that included Church, Kleene, and Rosser. By this time, G\u00f6del had grasped that the key property his theorems required is that the system must be effective (at the time, the term \"general recursive\" was used). Rosser proved in 1936 that the hypothesis of \u03c9-consistency, which was an integral part of G\u00f6del's original proof, could be replaced by simple consistency if the G\u00f6del sentence was changed appropriately. These developments left the incompleteness theorems in essentially their modern form.\nGentzen published his consistency proof for first-order arithmetic in 1936. Hilbert accepted this proof as \"finitary\" although (as G\u00f6del's theorem had already shown) it cannot be formalized within the system of arithmetic that is being proved consistent.\nThe impact of the incompleteness theorems on Hilbert's program was quickly realized. Bernays included a full proof of the incompleteness theorems in the second volume of \"Grundlagen der Mathematik\" (1939), along with additional results of Ackermann on the \u03b5-substitution method and Gentzen's consistency proof of arithmetic. This was the first full published proof of the second incompleteness theorem.\nCriticisms.\nFinsler.\n used a version of Richard's paradox to construct an expression that was false but unprovable in a particular, informal framework he had developed. G\u00f6del was unaware of this paper when he proved the incompleteness theorems (Collected Works Vol. IV., p.\u00a09). Finsler wrote to G\u00f6del in 1931 to inform him about this paper, which Finsler felt had priority for an incompleteness theorem. Finsler's methods did not rely on formalized provability and had only a superficial resemblance to G\u00f6del's work. G\u00f6del read the paper but found it deeply flawed, and his response to Finsler laid out concerns about the lack of formalization. Finsler continued to argue for his philosophy of mathematics, which eschewed formalization, for the remainder of his career.\nZermelo.\nIn September 1931, Ernst Zermelo wrote to G\u00f6del to announce what he described as an \"essential gap\" in G\u00f6del's argument. In October, G\u00f6del replied with a 10-page letter, where he pointed out that Zermelo mistakenly assumed that the notion of truth in a system is definable in that system; it is not true in general by Tarski's undefinability theorem. However, Zermelo did not relent and published his criticisms in print with \"a rather scathing paragraph on his young competitor\". G\u00f6del decided that pursuing the matter further was pointless, and Carnap agreed. Much of Zermelo's subsequent work was related to logic stronger than first-order logic, with which he hoped to show both the consistency and categoricity of mathematical theories.\nWittgenstein.\nLudwig Wittgenstein wrote several passages about the incompleteness theorems that were published posthumously in his 1953 \"Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics\", particularly, one section sometimes called the \"notorious paragraph\" where he seems to confuse the notions of \"true\" and \"provable\" in Russell's system. G\u00f6del was a member of the Vienna Circle during the period in which Wittgenstein's early ideal language philosophy and Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus dominated the circle's thinking. There has been some controversy about whether Wittgenstein misunderstood the incompleteness theorem or just expressed himself unclearly. Writings in G\u00f6del's Nachlass express the belief that Wittgenstein misread his ideas.\nMultiple commentators have read Wittgenstein as misunderstanding G\u00f6del, although as well as have provided textual readings arguing that most commentary misunderstands Wittgenstein. On their release, Bernays, Dummett, and Kreisel wrote separate reviews on Wittgenstein's remarks, all of which were extremely negative. The unanimity of this criticism caused Wittgenstein's remarks on the incompleteness theorems to have little impact on the logic community. In 1972, G\u00f6del stated: \"Has Wittgenstein lost his mind? Does he mean it seriously? He intentionally utters trivially nonsensical statements\", and wrote to Karl Menger that Wittgenstein's comments demonstrate a misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorems writing:\n It is clear from the passages you cite that Wittgenstein did \"not\" understand [the first incompleteness theorem] (or pretended not to understand it). He interpreted it as a kind of logical paradox, while in fact is just the opposite, namely a mathematical theorem within an absolutely uncontroversial part of mathematics (finitary number theory or combinatorics). \nSince the publication of Wittgenstein's \"Nachlass\" in 2000, a series of papers in philosophy have sought to evaluate whether the original criticism of Wittgenstein's remarks was justified. argue that Wittgenstein had a more complete understanding of the incompleteness theorem than was previously assumed. They are particularly concerned with the interpretation of a G\u00f6del sentence for an \u03c9-inconsistent system as saying \"I am not provable\", since the system has no models in which the provability predicate corresponds to actual provability. argues that their interpretation of Wittgenstein is not historically justified. explores the relationship between Wittgenstein's writing and theories of paraconsistent logic.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslations, during his lifetime, of G\u00f6del's paper into English.\nNone of the following agree in all translated words and in typography. The typography is a serious matter, because G\u00f6del expressly wished to emphasize \"those metamathematical notions that had been defined in their usual sense before . . .\" . Three translations exist. Of the first John Dawson states that: \"The Meltzer translation was seriously deficient and received a devastating review in the \"Journal of Symbolic Logic\"; \"G\u00f6del also complained about Braithwaite's commentary . \"Fortunately, the Meltzer translation was soon supplanted by a better one prepared by Elliott Mendelson for Martin Davis's anthology \"The Undecidable\" . . . he found the translation \"not quite so good\" as he had expected . . . [but because of time constraints he] agreed to its publication\" (ibid). (In a footnote Dawson states that \"he would regret his compliance, for the published volume was marred throughout by sloppy typography and numerous misprints\" (ibid)). Dawson states that \"The translation that G\u00f6del favored was that by Jean van Heijenoort\" (ibid). For the serious student another version exists as a set of lecture notes recorded by Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser \"during lectures given by G\u00f6del at to the Institute for Advanced Study during the spring of 1934\" (cf commentary by and beginning on p.\u00a041); this version is titled \"On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems\". In their order of publication:\n* Stephen Hawking editor, 2005. \"God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History\", Running Press, Philadelphia, . G\u00f6del's paper appears starting on p. 1097, with Hawking's commentary starting on p. 1089."}

{"id": "58865", "revid": "4626582", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58865", "title": "Wall Street (1987 film)", "text": "Film by Oliver Stone\nWall Street is a 1987 American crime drama film directed and co-written by Oliver Stone, which stars Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Daryl Hannah, and Martin Sheen. The film tells the story of Bud Fox (C. Sheen), a young stockbroker who becomes involved with Gordon Gekko (Douglas), a wealthy, unscrupulous corporate raider.\nStone made the film as a tribute to his father, Lou Stone, a stockbroker during the Great Depression. The character of Gekko is said to be a composite of several people, including Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, Michael Milken, and Stone himself. The character of Sir Lawrence Wildman, meanwhile, was modelled on British financier and corporate raider Sir James Goldsmith. Originally, the studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested; Stone, meanwhile, wanted Richard Gere, but Gere passed on the role.\nThe film was well received among major film critics. Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor, and the film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Douglas' character declaring that \"greed, for lack of a better word, is good.\" It has also proven influential in inspiring people to work on Wall Street, with Sheen, Douglas, and Stone commenting over the years how people still approach them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film.\nStone and Douglas reunited for a sequel titled \"\", which was released theatrically on September 24, 2010.\nPlot.\nIn 1985, Bud Fox is a junior stockbroker at Jackson Steinem &amp; Co. in New York City. He wants to work with his hero, Gordon Gekko, a legendary Wall Street player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his persistence, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which he has learned in a casual conversation with his father, Carl, leader of the company's maintenance workers' union. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it. A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients.\nAfter making a considerable amount of money from the Bluestar tip, Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects by honest research and advice from respected senior broker Lou Mannheim lose money. Gekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British investor Sir Lawrence Wildman. They deduce that Wildman is making a bid for Anacott Steel. Gekko buys a large block of shares in Anacott, which Wildman is forced to buy off him at a high price, to complete the takeover.\nBud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, which include a hooker who is sent to Bud's apartment, takes him on a limo ride, and performs fellatio on Bud in the back of the limo. He gets a penthouse on Manhattan's East Side. He also gains a girlfriend, Gekko's art consultant and ex-mistress, Darien, an interior decorator. Bud is promoted as a result of the large commissions he is bringing in and is given an office with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for himself and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nBud pitches a new idea to Gekko: buy Bluestar Airlines and expand the company, with Bud as president, using savings achieved by union concessions and the overfunded pension. Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and wracked with guilt for being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.\nBud and the union presidents secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy the stock and a controlling interest in Bluestar, at a significant discount, on the condition that he saves the company. Bud then devises a plan to leak news of Gekko's takeover to drive the price up. This forces Gekko to buy the stock at a higher price, as he tries to secure a controlling interest. Bud then convinces the unions to pull their support, ending any prospect of Gekko completing the takeover, and causing the price to plummet. This forces Gekko to offload his stock at a considerable loss. When Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes Bud has engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly returns to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested by the SEC, who had been tracking Bud's insider trading.\nLater, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko punches Bud several times, berating him for his role with Bluestar, and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Later, it is revealed that Bud was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko for the authorities, who suggest he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for providing evidence against Gekko. Later, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York County Courthouse, telling Bud he \"did the right thing\" by cooperating with the government and paying back his illicit earnings, and urging him to accept Wildman's offer of a job at Bluestar once he has completed his prison sentence. After suggesting Bud \"create, instead of living off the buying and selling of others\", Carl drops Bud off at the courthouse, where he ascends the steps, ready to face justice for his crimes.\nCast.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nAfter the success of \"Platoon\" (1986), Oliver Stone wanted film school friend and Los Angeles screenwriter Stanley Weiser to research and write a screenplay about quiz show scandals in the 1950s. During a story conference, Stone suggested making a film about Wall Street instead. Stone pitched the premise of two investment partners getting involved in questionable financial dealings, using each other, and they are tailed by a prosecutor as in \"Crime and Punishment\". Stone had been thinking about this kind of a film as early as 1981 and was inspired by his father, Lou Stone, a broker during the Great Depression at Hayden Stone.\nStone knew a New York businessman who was making millions and working long days putting together deals all over the world. This man started making mistakes that cost him everything. Stone remembers that the \"story frames what happens in my movie, which is basically a \"The Pilgrim's Progress\" of a boy who is seduced and corrupted by the allure of easy money. And in the third act, he sets out to redeem himself\". Stone asked Weiser to read \"Crime and Punishment\", but Weiser found that its story did not mix well with their own. Stone then asked Weiser to read \"The Great Gatsby\" for material that they could use, but it was not the right fit either. Weiser had no prior knowledge of the financial world and immersed himself in researching the world of stock trading, junk bonds, and corporate takeovers. He and Stone spent three weeks visiting brokerage houses and interviewing investors.\nScreenplay.\nWeiser wrote the first draft, initially called \"Greed\", with Stone writing another draft. Originally, Charlie Sheen's character was a young Jewish broker named Freddie Goldsmith, but Stone changed the name to Bud Fox to avoid the stereotype that Wall Street was controlled by Jews. Reportedly, Gordon Gekko is said to be a composite of several people: Wall Street broker Owen Morrisey, an old friend of Stone's who was involved in a $20\u00a0million insider trading scandal in 1985, Dennis Levine, Ivan Boesky, corporate raider Carl Icahn, investor and art collector Asher Edelman, agent Michael Ovitz, and Stone himself. For example, Stone told \"Newsweek\" that the \"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good\" line was based on a speech by Boesky where he said, \"Greed is right\".\nAccording to Edward R. Pressman, producer of the film, \"Originally, there was no one individual who Gekko was modeled on\", he adds, \"But Gekko was partly Milken\". Also, Pressman has said that the character of Sir Larry Wildman was modeled on James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French billionaire and corporate-raider.\nAccording to Weiser, Gekko's style of speaking was inspired by Stone. \"When I was writing some of the dialogue I would listen to Oliver on the phone and sometimes he talks very rapid-fire, the way Gordon Gekko does\". Stone cites as influences on his approach to business, the novels of Upton Sinclair, Sinclair Lewis and Victor Hugo, and the films of Paddy Chayefsky because they were able to make a complicated subject clear to the audience. Stone set the film in 1985 because insider trading scandals culminated in 1985 and 1986. This led to anachronisms in the script, including a reference to the Space Shuttle \"Challenger\" disaster, which had not yet occurred.\nCasting.\nStone met with Tom Cruise about playing Bud Fox, but Stone had already committed to Charlie Sheen for the role. Matthew Modine turned down the role of Bud Fox. Stone liked the \"stiffness\" of Sheen's acting style and used it to convey Bud's naivete. Michael Douglas had just come off heroic roles like the one in \"Romancing the Stone\" and was looking for something dark and edgy. The studio wanted Warren Beatty to play Gekko, but he was not interested. Stone initially wanted Richard Gere but Gere passed, so Stone went with Douglas despite having been advised by others in Hollywood not to cast him. Stone remembers, \"I was warned by everyone in Hollywood that Michael couldn't act, that he was a producer more than an actor and would spend all his time in his trailer on the phone\". Nevertheless, Stone found out that \"when he's acting he gives it his all\". Stone said that he saw \"that villain quality\" in Douglas and always thought he was a smart businessman. Douglas remembers that when he first read the screenplay, \"I thought it was a great part. It was a long script, and there were some incredibly long and intense monologues to open with. I'd never seen a screenplay where there were two or three pages of single-spaced type for a monologue. I thought, whoa! I mean, it was unbelievable\". For research, he read profiles of corporate raiders T. Boone Pickens and Carl Icahn.\nStone gave Charlie Sheen the choice of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked Martin Sheen, his own father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but felt that she was never happy with the role and did not know why she accepted it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. \"Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew wanted to get rid of her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work\". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had \"some problems\" with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.\nPrincipal photography.\nStone wanted to shoot the film in New York City and that required a budget of at least $15\u00a0million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed \"Platoon\" felt that it was too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. Parts of the film were shot in Snowbird, Utah. According to Stone, he was \"making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [director of photography Robert Richardson] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no let-up until you get to the fixed world of Charlie's father, where the stationary camera gives you a sense of immutable values\". The director saw [Wall Street] as a battle zone and \"filmed it as such\" including shooting conversations like physical confrontations, and in ensemble shots had the camera circle the actors \"in a way that makes you feel you're in a pool with sharks\".\nJeffrey \"Mad Dog\" Beck, a star investment banker at the time with Drexel Burnham Lambert, was one of the film's technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. Kenneth Lipper, investment banker and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser. At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be \"morally bankrupt\". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders' meeting where Gekko delivers his \"Greed is good\" speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on Wall Street is corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.\nStone also consulted with Carl Icahn, Asher Edelman, convicted inside trader David Brown, several government prosecutors, and Wall Street investment bankers. In addition, traders were brought in to coach actors on the set on how to hold phones, write out tickets, and talk to clients. Stone asked Lipper to design a six-week course that would expose Charlie Sheen to a cross section of young Wall Street business people. The actor said, \"I was impressed and very, very respectful of the fact that they could maintain that kind of aggressiveness and drive\".\nDouglas worked with a speech instructor on breath control in order to become better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his \"repressed anger\", according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because \"you look like you haven't acted before\". This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the \"Greed is good\" speech. Stone planned to use a \"Fortune\" magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but \"Forbes\" magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with \"Fortune\", which upset \"Forbes\" publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days in the last few weeks in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone was always looking at the script and at his watch.\nSoundtrack.\nThe original score composed by Stewart Copeland was released on LP record in 1988, followed by a CD version in 1993.\nThemes.\nThe film has come to be seen as the archetypal portrayal of 1980s excess, with Gekko advocating \"greed, for lack of a better word, is good\". \"Wall Street\" defines itself through a number of morality conflicts putting wealth and power against simplicity and honesty, and an attack on the value system of extreme competitiveness where ethics and the law are simply irrelevant parts of the show.\nCarl (Martin Sheen's character) represents the working class in the film: he is the union leader for the maintenance workers at Bluestar. He constantly attacks big business, money, mandatory drug screening, greedy manufacturers, and anything that he sees as a threat to his union. The conflict between Gekko's relentless pursuit of wealth and Carl Fox's leftward leanings form the basis of the film's subtext. This subtext could be described as the concept of the two fathers battling for control over the morals of the son, a concept Stone had also used in \"Platoon\". In \"Wall Street\" the hard-working Carl Fox and the cutthroat businessman Gordon Gekko represent the fathers. The producers of the film use Carl as their voice in the film, a voice of reason amid the creative destruction brought about by Gekko's unrestrained personal philosophy.\nA significant scene in the film is a speech by Gekko to a shareholders' meeting of Teldar Paper, a company he is planning to take over. Stone uses this scene to give Gekko, and by extension, the Wall Street raiders he personifies, the chance to justify their actions, portraying himself as a liberator of the company value from the ineffective and excessively compensated executives. The inspiration for the \"Greed is good\" speech seems to have come from two sources. The first part, where Gekko complains that the company's management owns less than three percent of its stock, and that it has too many vice presidents, is taken from similar speeches and comments made by Carl Icahn about companies he was trying to take over. The defense of greed was adapted from a remark by Boesky, who himself was later convicted of insider trading charges. Delivering the 1986 commencement address to the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Berkeley, Boesky said, \"Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself.\"\n\"Wall Street\" is not a wholesale criticism of capitalism, but of the cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s. The \"good\" characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Sir Laurence Wildman genuinely attempts to save Anacott Steel and ultimately saves Blue Star instead, although Gekko taunts him that he laid off thousands of workers in previous companies which he took over. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that \"good things sometimes take time\", referring to IBM and Hilton\u2014in contrast, Gekko's \"Greed is Good\" credo and his frequent references to Sun Tzu's \"The Art of War\" typify the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Wall Street\" was released on December 11, 1987, in 730 theaters and grossed $4.1\u00a0million on its opening weekend. It went on to make $43.8\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, earning theatrical rentals of $20\u00a0million. Internationally, it earned rentals of $21\u00a0million for a worldwide total of $41\u00a0million.\nCritical response.\nThe film has a 79% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The consensus reads, \"With \"Wall Street\", Oliver Stone delivers a blunt but effective\u2014and thoroughly well-acted\u2014jeremiad against its era's veneration of greed as a means to its own end.\" On Metacritic it has a score of 56 out of 100 from 16 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\nIn his review for \"The New York Times\", Vincent Canby, while quite critical of the film overall, praised Douglas' work as \"the funniest, canniest performance of his career\". Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars out of four and praised it for allowing \"all the financial wheeling and dealing to seem complicated and convincing, and yet always have it make sense. The movie can be followed by anybody, because the details of stock manipulation are all filtered through transparent layers of greed. Most of the time we know what's going on. All of the time, we know why\". \"Time\" magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, \"This time he works up a salty sweat to end up nowhere, like a triathlete on a treadmill. But as long as he keeps his players in venal, perpetual motion, it is great scary fun to watch him work out\". In his review for \"The Globe and Mail\", Jay Scott praised the performances of the two leads: \"But Douglas's portrayal of Gordon Gekko is an oily triumph and as the kid Gekko thinks he has found in Fox ('Poor, smart and hungry; no feelings'), Charlie Sheen evolves persuasively from gung-ho capitalist child to wily adolescent corporate raider to morally appalled adult\". Rita Kempley wrote in \"The Washington Post\" that the film \"is at its weakest when it preaches visually or verbally. Stone doesn't trust the time-honored story line, supplementing the obvious moral with plenty of soapboxery\". F.F. Mormani, writing for \"The Objective Standard\", calls the film \"mixed\", explaining that it \"accurately portray[s] some aspects of the financial profession and unjustly demonizing it, too. But,\" she concludes, \"it is sufficiently thought provoking and philosophical to recommend watching or rewatching.\"\nMichael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor and thanked Oliver Stone for \"casting me in a part that almost nobody thought I could play\". However, Daryl Hannah's performance was not as well received and earned her a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actress, thus making this the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. The \"quintessential financial high-roller's attire\" of Douglas in the film, designed by Alan Flusser, was emulated in the 1980s by yuppies.\nInterest in the film was renewed in 1990 when the cover of \"Newsweek\" magazine asked, \"Is Greed Dead?\" after 1980s icons like Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky ran afoul of insider trading laws. Over the years, the film's screenwriter Stanley Weiser has been approached by numerous people who told him, \"The movie changed my life. Once I saw it I knew that I wanted to get into such and such business. I wanted to be like Gordon Gekko\". In addition, both Charlie Sheen and Michael Douglas still have people come up to them and say that they became stockbrokers because of their respective characters in the film. In 2002, Stone was asked how the financial market depicted in \"Wall Street\" has changed and he replied, \"The problems that existed in the 1980s market grew and grew into a much larger phenomenon. Enron is a fiction, in a sense, in the same way that Gordon Gekko's buying and selling was a fiction ... Kenny Lay\u2014he's the new Gordon Gekko\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine's Owen Gleiberman commented in 2009 that the film \"reveals something now which it couldn't back then: that the Gordon Gekkos of the world weren't just getting rich\u2014they were creating an alternate reality that was going to crash down on all of us.\" \nA 20th-anniversary edition was released on September 18, 2007. New extras include an on-camera introduction by Stone, extensive deleted scenes, \"Greed is Good\" featurettes, and interviews with Michael Douglas and Martin Sheen.\nIn reviewing the film's sequel 23 years later, \"Variety\" noted that though the original film was \"intended as a cautionary tale on the pitfalls of unchecked ambition and greed, Stone's 1987 original instead had the effect of turning Douglas' hugely charismatic (and Oscar-winning) villain into a household name and boardroom icon \u2013 an inspiration to the very power players and Wall Street wannabes for whom he set such a terrible example.\"\nIn 2024, \"Far Out\" magazine named Gordon Gekko one of the \"10 most accurate movie psychopaths according to the FBI\".\nAccolades.\nThe film is notable as being the only film to win both an Academy Award and a Golden Raspberry Award.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nSequel.\nIn 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported that a sequel to \"Wall Street\", to be subtitled \"Money Never Sleeps\", was already in pre-production. Michael Douglas would reprise his role as Gordon Gekko. The film would also focus on Gekko, recently released from prison and re-entering a much more chaotic financial world than the one he once oversaw. Charlie Sheen would also reprise his character of Bud Fox, but only in a cameo role. Daryl Hannah would not be involved in the sequel.\nBut by April 2009, 20th Century Fox confirmed that the sequel was already in development and announced that Oliver Stone would direct. In addition, Shia LaBeouf was cast with Josh Brolin. Javier Bardem had been considered, but Bardem dropped out due to scheduling conflicts. The film was finally released on September 24, 2010, and received mixed reviews.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was educated by the Jesuits at the Real Seminario de Nobles in Madrid, wrote verses when he was twelve, became an enthusiastic admirer of Walter Scott and Chateaubriand, and took part in the school performances of plays by Lope de Vega and Calder\u00f3n de la Barca.\nIn 1833, he was sent to study law at the university of Toledo, but after a year of idleness, he fled to Madrid, where he horrified the friends of his absolutist father by making violent speeches and by founding a newspaper that promptly was suppressed by the government. He narrowly escaped transportation to the Philippines, and spent the next few years in poverty.\nThe death of the satirist Mariano Jos\u00e9 de Larra brought Zorrilla into notice. His elegiac poem, read at Larra's funeral in February 1837, introduced him to the leading men of letters. In 1837 he published a book of verses, mostly imitations of Alphonse de Lamartine and Victor Hugo, which was so favourably received that he printed six more volumes within three years.\nAfter collaborating with Antonio Garc\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez on the play \"Ju\u00e1n Dondolo\" (1839), Zorrilla began his individual career as a dramatist with \"Cada cual con su raz\u00f3n\" (1840), and during the next five years he wrote 22 plays, many of them extremely successful. His \"Cantos del trovador\" (1841), a collection of national legends written in verse, made Zorilla second only to Jos\u00e9 de Espronceda in popular esteem.\nNational legends also supply the themes of his dramas, which Zorilla often constructed by adapting older plays that had fallen out of fashion. For example, in \"El Zapatero y el Rey\" he recasts \"El montan\u00e9s Juan Pascual\" by Juan de la Hoz y Mota; in \"La mejor Talon la espada\" he borrows from Agust\u00edn Moreto y Cavana's \"Travesuras del estudiante Pa-atoja\". His famous play \"Don Juan Tenorio\" is a combination of elements from Tirso de Molina's \"Burlador de Sevilla\" and from Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re's \"Don Juan de Marana\" (which itself derives from \"Les \u00c2mes du purgatoire\" by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e). However, plays like \"Sancho Garc\u00eda\", \"El Rey loco\", and \"El Alcalde Ronquillo\" are much more original. He considered his last play, \"Traidor, inconfeso y m\u00e1rtir\" (1845), to be his best play.\nUpon the death of his mother in 1847, Zorrilla left Spain. He resided for a while at Bordeaux, and settled in Paris, where his incomplete poem \"Granada\" was published in 1852. In a fit of depression, he emigrated to America three years later, hoping, he claimed, that yellow fever or smallpox would kill him. During eleven years in Mexico he wrote very little. He returned to Spain in 1866, to find himself half-forgotten and considered old-fashioned.\nFriends helped Zorilla obtain a small post, but the republican minister later abolished it. He was always poor, especially for the 12 years after 1871. The publication of his autobiography, \"Recuerdos del tiempo viejo\" in 1880, did nothing to alleviate his poverty. Though his plays were still being performed, he received no money from them.\nFinally, in his old age, critics began to reappraise his work, and brought him new fame. He received a pension of 30,000 reales, a gold medal of honor from the Spanish Academy, and, in 1889, the title of National Laureate. He died in Madrid on 23 January 1893.\nIn his early years, Zorrilla was known as an extraordinarily fast writer. He claimed he wrote \"El Caballo del Rey Don Sancho\" in three weeks, and that he put together \"El Pu\u00f1al del Godo\" in two days. This may account for some of the technical faults\u2014redundancy and verbosity\u2014in his works. His plays often appeal to Spanish patriotic pride, and actors and audiences have enjoyed his effective dramaturgy. \"Don Juan Tenorio\" is his best-known work.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The village has a population of 490.\nHistory.\nThe territory formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century. After the fragmentation of Poland into smaller provincial duchies, it formed part of the duchies of Silesia and Greater Poland. Either Henry the Bearded or W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic granted the village to the Knights Templar by 1232. The village was first mentioned in 1261 as \"Torbarmstorp\" as their possession. It was annexed by the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and included within the New March. \nBy 1335 it was known as \"Tzorbensdorf\". From 1373, it formed part of the Bohemian (Czech) Crown Lands, ruled by the Luxembourg dynasty. In 1402, the Luxembourgs reached an agreement with Poland in Krak\u00f3w, by which Poland was to buy and re-incorporate the territory, but eventually the Luxembourgs sold it to the Teutonic Order.

{"id": "58875", "revid": "8565473", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58875", "title": "Maclura pomifera", "text": "Plant species in the fig family\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Taxobox/core/styles.css\" /&gt;\nMaclura pomifera, commonly known as the Osage orange ( ), is a small deciduous tree or large shrub, native to the south-central United States. It typically grows about tall. The distinctive fruit, a multiple fruit that resembles an immature orange, is roughly spherical, bumpy, in diameter, and turns bright yellow-green in the fall. The fruit excretes a sticky white latex when cut or damaged. Despite the name \"Osage orange\", it is not related to the orange. It is a member of the mulberry family, Moraceae. Due to its latex secretions and woody pulp, the fruit is typically not eaten by humans and rarely by foraging animals. Ecologists Daniel H. Janzen and Paul S. Martin proposed in 1982 that the fruit of this species might be an example of what has come to be called an evolutionary anachronism\u2014that is, a fruit coevolved with a large animal seed dispersal partner that is now extinct. This hypothesis is controversial.\n\"Maclura pomifera\" has many common names, including mock orange, horse apple, hedge apple, hedge ball, monkey ball, pap, monkey brains, and yellow-wood. The name \"bois d'arc\" (French, meaning \"bow-wood\") has also been corrupted into bodark and bodock.\nHistory.\nThe earliest account of the tree in the English language was given by William Dunbar, a Scottish explorer, in his narrative of a journey made in 1804 from St. Catherine's Landing on the Mississippi River to the Ouachita River. Meriwether Lewis sent some slips and cuttings of the curiosity to President Jefferson in March 1804. According to Lewis's letter, the samples were donated by \"Mr. Peter Choteau, who resided the greater portion of his time for many years with the Osage Nation\". (Note: This referred to Pierre Chouteau, a fur trader from Saint Louis.) Those cuttings did not survive. In 1810, Bradbury relates that he found two \"M. pomifera\" trees growing in the garden of Pierre Chouteau, one of the first settlers of Saint Louis, apparently the same person.\nAmerican settlers used the Osage orange (i.e. \"hedge apple\") as a hedge to exclude free-range livestock from vegetable gardens and corn fields. Under severe pruning, the hedge apple sprouted abundant adventitious shoots from its base; as these shoots grew, they became interwoven and formed a dense, thorny barrier hedge. The thorny Osage orange tree was widely naturalized throughout the United States until this usage was superseded by the invention of barbed wire in 1874. By providing a barrier that was \"horse-high, bull-strong, and pig-tight\", Osage orange hedges provided the \"crucial stop-gap measure for westward expansion until the introduction of barbed wire a few decades later\".\nThe trees were named (\"bow-wood\") by early French settlers who observed the wood being used for war clubs and bow-making by Native Americans. Meriwether Lewis was told that the people of the Osage Nation, \"So much ... esteem the wood of this tree for the purpose of making their bows, that they travel many hundreds of miles in quest of it.\" The trees are also known as \"bodark\", \"bodarc\", or \"bodock\" trees, most likely originating as a corruption of .\nThe Comanche also used this wood for their bows. They liked the wood because it was strong, flexible, and durable, and the bush/tree was common along river bottoms of the Comancher\u00eda. Some historians believe that the high value this wood had to Native Americans throughout North America for the making of bows, along with its small natural range, contributed to the great wealth of the Spiroan Mississippian culture that controlled all the land in which these trees grew.\nEtymology.\nThe genus \"Maclura\" is named in honor of William Maclure (1763\u20131840), a Scottish-born American geologist. The specific epithet \"pomifera\" means \"fruit-bearing\". The common name \"Osage\" derives from Osage Native Americans from whom young plants were first obtained, as told in the notes of Meriwether Lewis in 1804.\nDescription.\nGeneral habit.\nMature trees range from tall with short trunks and round-topped canopies. The roots are thick, fleshy, and covered with bright orange bark. The tree's mature bark is dark, deeply furrowed, and scaly. The plant has significant potential to invade unmanaged habitats.\nThe wood of \"M. pomifera\" is golden to bright yellow, but fades to medium brown with ultraviolet light exposure. The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and flexible, capable of receiving a fine polish and very durable in contact with the ground. It has a specific gravity of 0.7736 or .\nLeaves and branches.\nLeaves are arranged alternately in a slender growing shoot long. In form they are simple, a long oval terminating in a slender point. The leaves are long and wide, and are thick, firm, dark green, shining above, and paler green below when full grown. In autumn they turn bright yellow. The leaf axils contain formidable spines, which when mature, are about long.\nBranchlets are at first bright green and pubescent; during their first winter, they become light brown tinged with orange, and later they become a paler orange-brown. Branches contain a yellow pith, and are armed with stout, straight, axillary spines. During the winter, the branches bear lateral buds that are depressed-globular, partly immersed in the bark, and pale chestnut brown in color.\nFlowers and fruit.\nAs a dioecious plant, the inconspicuous pistillate (female) and staminate (male) flowers are found on different trees. Staminate flowers are pale green, small, and arranged in racemes borne on long, slender, drooping peduncles developed from the axils of crowded leaves on the spur-like branchlets of the previous year. They feature a hairy, four-lobed calyx; the four stamens are inserted opposite the lobes of calyx, on the margin of a thin disk. Pistillate flowers are borne in a dense, spherical, many-flowered head, which appears on a short, stout peduncle from the axils of the current year's growth. Each flower has a hairy, four-lobed calyx with thick, concave lobes that invest the ovary and enclose the fruit. Ovaries are superior, ovate, compressed, green, and crowned by a long slender style covered with white stigmatic hairs. The ovule is solitary.\nThe mature multiple fruit's size and general appearance resembles a large, yellow-green orange (the fruit), about in diameter, with a roughened and tuberculated surface. The compound (or multiple) fruit is a syncarp of numerous small drupes, in which the carpels (ovaries) have grown together; thus, it is classified a multiple-accessory fruit. Each small drupe is oblong, compressed, and rounded; it contains a milky latex that oozes when the fruit is damaged or cut. The seeds are oblong. Although the flowering is dioecious, the pistillate tree when isolated will still bear large oranges, visually perfect, but lacking the seeds. The fruit has a slightly cucumber-like flavor.\nDistribution.\nOsage orange's pre-Columbian range was largely restricted to a small area in what is now the United States, namely the Red River drainage of Oklahoma, Texas, and Arkansas, as well as the Blackland Prairies and post oak savannas. A disjunct population also occurred in the Chisos Mountains of Texas. It has since become widely naturalized in the United States and Ontario, Canada. Osage orange has been planted in all the 48 contiguous states of the United States and in southeastern Canada.\nThe largest known Osage orange tree is located at the Patrick Henry National Memorial, in Brookneal, Virginia, and is believed to be almost 350 years old. Another historic tree is located on the grounds of Fort Harrod, a Kentucky pioneer settlement in Harrodsburg, Kentucky.\nEcological aspects of historical distribution.\nBecause of the limited original range and lack of obvious effective means of propagation, the Osage orange has been the subject of controversial claims by some authors to be an evolutionary anachronism, whereby one or more now extinct Pleistocene megafauna, such as ground sloths, mammoths, mastodons, or gomphotheres, fed on the fruit and aided in seed dispersal. An equine species that became extinct at the same time also has been suggested as the plant's original dispersal agent because modern horses and other livestock sometimes eat the fruit. This hypothesis is controversial. For example, a 2015 study indicated that Osage orange seeds are not effectively spread by extant horse or elephant species, while a 2018 study concludes that squirrels are ineffective, short-distance seed dispersers. The claim has been criticized as a \"just-so story\" that lacks any empirical evidence.\nThe fruit is not poisonous to humans or livestock, but is not preferred by them, because it is mostly inedible due to a large size (about the diameter of a softball) and hard, dry texture. The edible seeds of the fruit are used by squirrels as food. Large animals such as livestock, which typically would consume fruits and disperse seeds, mainly ignore the fruit.\nEcology.\nThe fruits are consumed by black-tailed deer in Texas, and white-tailed deer and fox squirrels in the Midwest. Crossbills are said to peck the seeds out. Loggerhead shrikes, a declining species in much of North America, use the tree for nesting and cache prey items upon its thorns.\nCultivation.\n\"Maclura pomifera\" prefers a deep and fertile soil, but is hardy over most of the contiguous United States, where it is used as a hedge. It must be regularly pruned to keep it in bounds, and the shoots of a single year will grow long, making it suitable for coppicing. A neglected hedge will become fruit-bearing. It is remarkably free from insect predators and fungal diseases. A thornless male cultivar of the species exists and is vegetatively reproduced for ornamental use. \"M. pomifera\" is cultivated in Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, former USSR, and India.\nChemistry.\nOsajin and pomiferin are isoflavones present in the wood and fruit in a roughly 1:2 ratio by weight, and in turn comprise 4\u20136% of the weight of dry fruit and wood samples. Primary components of fresh fruit include pectin (46%), resin (17%), fat (5%), and sugar (before hydrolysis, 5%). The moisture content of fresh fruits is about 80%.\nUses.\nThe Osage orange is commonly used as a tree row windbreak in prairie states, which gives it one of its colloquial names, \"hedge apple\". It was one of the primary trees used in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's \"Great Plains Shelterbelt\" WPA project, which was launched in 1934 as an ambitious plan to modify weather and prevent soil erosion in the Great Plains states; by 1942, it resulted in the planting of 30,233 shelterbelts containing 220 million trees that stretched for . The sharp-thorned trees were also planted as cattle-deterring hedges before the introduction of barbed wire, and afterward became an important source of fence posts. In 2001, its wood was used in the construction in Chestertown, Maryland, of the schooner \"Sultana\", a replica of .\nThe heavy, close-grained, yellow-orange wood is dense and prized for tool handles, treenails, fence posts, and other applications requiring a strong, dimensionally stable wood that withstands rot. Although its wood is commonly knotty and twisted, straight-grained Osage orange timber makes good bows, as used by Native Americans. John Bradbury, a Scottish botanist who had traveled the interior United States extensively in the early 19th century, reported that a bow made of Osage timber could be traded for a horse and a blanket. Additionally, a yellow-orange dye can be extracted from the wood, which can be used as a substitute for fustic and aniline dyes. At present, florists use the fruits of \"M. pomifera\" for decorative purposes.\nWhen dried, the wood has the highest heating value of any commonly available North American wood.\nOsage orange wood is more rot-resistant than most, making good fence posts. They are generally set up green because the dried wood is too hard to reliably accept the staples used to attach the fencing to the posts. Palmer and Fowler's \"Fieldbook of Natural History\" 2nd edition rates Osage orange wood as being at least twice as hard and strong as white oak (\"Quercus alba\"). Its dense grain structure makes for good tonal properties. Production of woodwind instruments and waterfowl game calls are common uses for the wood.\nCompounds extracted from the fruit, when concentrated, may repel insects, but the naturally occurring concentrations of these compounds in the fruit are too low to make the fruit an effective insect repellent. In 2004, the EPA insisted that a website selling \"M. pomifera\" fruits online remove any mention of their supposed repellent properties as false advertising.\nTraditional medicine.\nThe Comanche formerly used a decoction of the roots topically as a wash to treat sore eyes.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Artificial sweeteners may be derived from plant extracts or processed by chemical synthesis. Sugar substitute products are commercially available in various forms, such as small pills, powders and packets.\nCommon sugar substitutes include aspartame, monk fruit extract, saccharin, sucralose, stevia, acesulfame potassium (ace-K) and cyclamate. These sweeteners are a fundamental ingredient in diet drinks to sweeten them without adding calories. Additionally, sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol are derived from sugars.\nNo links have been found between approved artificial sweeteners and cancer in humans. Reviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a relatively safe replacement for sugars that can help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight.\nTypes.\nArtificial sweeteners may be derived through manufacturing of plant extracts or processed by chemical synthesis.\nHigh-intensity sweeteners\u2014one type of sugar substitute\u2014are compounds with many times the sweetness of sucrose (common table sugar). As a result, much less sweetener is required and energy contribution is often negligible. The sensation of sweetness caused by these compounds is sometimes notably different from sucrose, so they are often used in complex mixtures that achieve the most intense sweet sensation.\nIn North America, common sugar substitutes include aspartame, monk fruit extract, saccharin, sucralose and stevia. Cyclamate is prohibited from being used as a sweetener within the United States, but is allowed in other parts of the world.\nSorbitol, xylitol and lactitol are examples of sugar alcohols (also known as polyols). These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. Sometimes the sweetness profile is fine-tuned by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners.\nAllulose.\nAllulose is a sweetener in the sugar family, with a chemical structure similar to fructose. It is naturally found in figs, maple syrup and some fruit. While it comes from the same family as other sugars, it does not substantially metabolize as sugar in the body. The FDA recognizes that allulose does not act like sugar, and as of 2019, no longer requires it to be listed with sugars on U.S. nutrition labels. Allulose is about 70% as sweet as sugar, which is why it is sometimes combined with high-intensity sweeteners to make sugar substitutes.\nAcesulfame potassium.\nAcesulfame potassium (Ace-K) is 200 times sweeter than sucrose (common sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about two-thirds as sweet as saccharin, and one-third as sweet as sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Acesulfame potassium is often blended with other sweeteners (usually aspartame or sucralose), which give a more sucrose-like taste, whereby each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste and also exhibits a synergistic effect in which the blend is sweeter than its components.\nUnlike aspartame, acesulfame potassium is stable under heat, even under moderately acidic or basic conditions, allowing it to be used as a food additive in baking or in products that require a long shelf life. In carbonated drinks, it is almost always used in conjunction with another sweetener, such as aspartame or sucralose. It is also used as a sweetener in protein shakes and pharmaceutical products, especially chewable and liquid medications, where it can make the active ingredients more palatable.\nAspartame.\nAspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter at the G.D. Searle company. He was working on an anti-ulcer drug and accidentally spilled some aspartame on his hand. When he licked his finger, he noticed that it had a sweet taste. Torunn Atteraas Garin oversaw the development of aspartame as an artificial sweetener. It is an odorless, white crystalline powder that is derived from the two amino acids aspartic acid and phenylalanine. It is about 180\u2013200 times sweeter than sugar, and can be used as a tabletop sweetener or in frozen desserts, gelatins, beverages and chewing gum. When cooked or stored at high temperatures, aspartame breaks down into its constituent amino acids. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener. It is more stable in somewhat acidic conditions, such as in soft drinks. Though it does not have a bitter aftertaste like saccharin, it may not taste exactly like sugar. When eaten, aspartame is metabolized into its original amino acids. Because it is so intensely sweet, relatively little of it is needed to sweeten a food product, and is thus useful for reducing the number of calories in a product.\nThe safety of aspartame has been studied extensively since its discovery with research that includes animal studies, clinical and epidemiological research, and postmarketing surveillance, with aspartame being a rigorously tested food ingredient. Although aspartame has been subject to claims against its safety, multiple authoritative reviews have found it to be safe for consumption at typical levels used in food manufacturing. Aspartame has been deemed safe for human consumption by over 100 regulatory agencies in their respective countries, including the UK Food Standards Agency, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and Health Canada.\nCyclamate.\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of cyclamate in 1969 after lab tests in rats involving a 10:1 mixture of cyclamate and saccharin (at levels comparable to humans ingesting 550 cans of diet soda per day) caused bladder cancer. This information, however, is regarded as \"weak\" evidence of carcinogenic activity, and cyclamate remains in common use in many parts of the world, including Canada, the European Union and Russia.\nMogrosides (monk fruit).\nMogrosides, extracted from monk fruit (which is commonly also called ), are recognized as safe for human consumption and are used in commercial products worldwide. As of 2017, it is not a permitted sweetener in the European Union, although it is allowed as a flavor at concentrations where it does not function as a sweetener. In 2017, a Chinese company requested a scientific review of its mogroside product by the European Food Safety Authority. It is the basis of McNeil Nutritionals' tabletop sweetener Nectresse in the United States and Norbu Sweetener in Australia.\nSaccharin.\nApart from sugar of lead (used as a sweetener in ancient through medieval times before the toxicity of lead was known), saccharin was the first artificial sweetener and was originally synthesized in 1879 by Remsen and Fahlberg. Its sweet taste was discovered by accident. It had been created in an experiment with toluene derivatives. A process for the creation of saccharin from phthalic anhydride was developed in 1950, and, currently, saccharin is created by this process as well as the original process by which it was discovered. It is 300 to 500 times sweeter than sucrose and is often used to improve the taste of toothpastes, dietary foods and dietary beverages. The bitter aftertaste of saccharin is often minimized by blending it with other sweeteners.\nFear about saccharin increased when a 1960 study showed that high levels of saccharin may cause bladder cancer in laboratory rats. In 1977, Canada banned saccharin as a result of the animal research. In the United States, the FDA considered banning saccharin in 1977, but Congress stepped in and placed a moratorium on such a ban. The moratorium required a warning label and also mandated further study of saccharin safety.\nSubsequently, it was discovered that saccharin causes cancer in male rats by a mechanism not found in humans. At high doses, saccharin causes a precipitate to form in rat urine. This precipitate damages the cells lining the bladder (urinary bladder urothelial cytotoxicity) and a tumor forms when the cells regenerate (regenerative hyperplasia). According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of the World Health Organization, \"This mechanism is not relevant to humans because of critical interspecies differences in urine composition\".\nIn 2001, the United States repealed the warning label requirement, while the threat of an FDA ban had already been lifted in 1991. Most other countries also permit saccharin, but restrict the levels of use, while other countries have outright banned it.\nThe EPA has removed saccharin and its salts from their list of hazardous constituents and commercial chemical products. In a 14 December 2010 release, the EPA stated that saccharin is no longer considered a potential hazard to human health.\nSteviol glycosides (stevia).\nStevia is a natural non-caloric sweetener derived from the \"Stevia rebaudiana\" plant, and is manufactured as a sweetener. It is indigenous to South America, and has historically been used in Japanese food products, although it is now common internationally. In 1987, the FDA issued a ban on stevia because it had not been approved as a food additive, although it continued to be available as a dietary supplement. After being provided with sufficient scientific data demonstrating safety of using stevia as a manufactured sweetener, from companies such as Cargill and Coca-Cola, the FDA gave a \"no objection\" status as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in December 2008 to Cargill for its stevia product, Truvia, for use of the refined stevia extracts as a blend of rebaudioside A and erythritol. In Australia, the brand Vitarium uses Natvia, a stevia sweetener, in a range of sugar-free children's milk mixes.\nIn August 2019, the FDA placed an import alert on stevia leaves and crude extracts\u2014which do not have GRAS status\u2014and on foods or dietary supplements containing them, citing concerns about safety and potential for toxicity.\nSucralose.\nThe world's most commonly used artificial sweetener, sucralose is a chlorinated sugar that is about 600 times sweeter than sugar. It is produced from sucrose when three chlorine atoms replace three hydroxyl groups. It is used in beverages, frozen desserts, chewing gum, baked goods and other foods. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it is stable when heated and can therefore be used in baked and fried goods. Discovered in 1976, the FDA approved sucralose for use in 1998.\nMost of the controversy surrounding Splenda, a sucralose sweetener, is focused not on safety but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, \"Splenda is made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.\" Sucralose is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or raffinose. With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.\nThe \"Truth About Splenda\" website was created in 2005 by the Sugar Association, an organization representing sugar beet and sugar cane farmers in the United States, to provide its view of sucralose. In December 2004, five separate false-advertising claims were filed by the Sugar Association against Splenda manufacturers Merisant and McNeil Nutritionals for claims made about Splenda related to the slogan, \"Made from sugar, so it tastes like sugar.\" French courts ordered the slogan to no longer be used in France, while in the U.S., the case came to an undisclosed settlement during the trial.\nThere are few safety concerns pertaining to sucralose and the way sucralose is metabolized suggests a reduced risk of toxicity. For example, sucralose is extremely insoluble in fat and, thus, does not accumulate in fatty tissues; sucralose also does not break down and will dechlorinate only under conditions that are not found during regular digestion (i.e., high heat applied to the powder form of the molecule). Only about 15% of sucralose is absorbed by the body and most of it passes out of the body unchanged.\nIn 2017, sucralose was the most common sugar substitute used in the manufacture of foods and beverages; it had 30% of the global market, which was projected to be valued at $2.8 billion by 2021.\nSugar alcohol.\nSugar alcohols, or polyols, are sweetening and bulking ingredients used in the manufacturing of foods and beverages, particularly sugar-free candies, cookies and chewing gums. As a sugar substitute, they typically are less-sweet and supply fewer calories (about a half to one-third fewer calories) than sugar. They are converted to glucose slowly, and do not spike increases in blood glucose.\nSorbitol, xylitol, mannitol, erythritol and lactitol are examples of sugar alcohols. These are, in general, less sweet than sucrose, but have similar bulk properties and can be used in a wide range of food products. The sweetness profile may be altered during manufacturing by mixing with high-intensity sweeteners.\nSugar alcohols are carbohydrates with a biochemical structure partially matching the structures of sugar and alcohol, although not containing ethanol. They are not entirely metabolized by the human body. The unabsorbed sugar alcohols may cause bloating and diarrhea due to their osmotic effect, if consumed in sufficient amounts. They are found commonly in small quantities in some fruits and vegetables, and are commercially manufactured from different carbohydrates and starch.\nProduction.\nThe majority of sugar substitutes approved for food use are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk plant-derived sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol, xylitol and lactitol. As it is not commercially profitable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol.\nUse.\nReasons for use.\nSugar substitutes are used instead of sugar for a number of reasons, including:\nDental care.\nCarbohydrates and sugars usually adhere to the tooth enamel, where bacteria feed upon them and quickly multiply. The bacteria convert the sugar to acids that decay the teeth. Sugar substitutes, unlike sugar, do not erode teeth as they are not fermented by the microflora of the dental plaque. A sweetener that may benefit dental health is xylitol, which tends to prevent bacteria from adhering to the tooth surface, thus preventing plaque formation and eventually tooth decay. A Cochrane review, however, found only low-quality evidence that xylitol in a variety of dental products actually has any benefit in preventing tooth decay in adults and children.\nDietary concerns.\nSugar substitutes are a fundamental ingredient in diet drinks to sweeten them without adding calories. Additionally, sugar alcohols such as erythritol, xylitol and sorbitol are derived from sugars. In the United States, six high-intensity sugar substitutes have been approved for use: aspartame, sucralose, neotame, acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), saccharin and advantame. Food additives must be approved by the FDA, and sweeteners must be proven as safe via submission by a manufacturer of a GRAS document. The conclusions about GRAS are based on a detailed review of a large body of information, including rigorous toxicological and clinical studies. GRAS notices exist for two plant-based, high-intensity sweeteners: steviol glycosides obtained from stevia leaves (\"Stevia rebaudiana\") and extracts from \"Siraitia grosvenorii\", also called \"luo han guo\" or monk fruit.\nCost and shelf life.\nMany sugar substitutes are cheaper than sugar in the final food formulation. Sugar substitutes are often lower in total cost because of their long shelf life and high sweetening intensity. This allows sugar substitutes to be used in products that will not perish after a short period of time.\nAcceptable daily intake levels.\nIn the United States, the FDA provides guidance for manufacturers and consumers about the daily limits for consuming high-intensity sweeteners, a measure called \"acceptable daily intake\" (ADI). During their premarket review for all of the high-intensity sweeteners approved as food additives, the FDA established an ADI defined as an amount in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bw/d), indicating that a high-intensity sweetener does not cause safety concerns if estimated daily intakes are lower than the ADI. The FDA states: \"An ADI is the amount of a substance that is considered safe to consume each day over the course of a person's lifetime.\" For stevia (specifically, steviol glycosides), an ADI was not derived by the FDA, but by the Joint Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization Expert Committee on Food Additives, whereas an ADI has not been determined for monk fruit.\nFor the sweeteners approved as food additives, the ADIs in milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day are:\nMouthfeel.\nIf the sucrose, or other sugar, that is replaced has contributed to the texture of the product, then a bulking agent is often also needed. This may be seen in soft drinks or sweet teas that are labeled as \"diet\" or \"light\" that contain artificial sweeteners and often have notably different mouthfeel, or in table sugar replacements that mix maltodextrins with an intense sweetener to achieve satisfactory texture sensation.\nSweetness intensity.\nThe FDA has published estimates of sweetness intensity, called a \"multiplier of sweetness intensity\" (MSI) as compared to table sugar.\nPlant-derived.\nThe sweetness levels and energy densities are in comparison to those of sucrose.\nResearch.\nBody weight.\nReviews and dietetic professionals have concluded that moderate use of non-nutritive sweeteners as a safe replacement for sugars may help limit energy intake and assist with managing blood glucose and weight. Other reviews found that the association between body weight and non-nutritive sweetener usage is inconclusive. Observational studies tend to show a relation with increased body weight, while randomized controlled trials instead show a little causal weight loss. Other reviews concluded that use of non-nutritive sweeteners instead of sugar reduces body weight.\nObesity.\nThere is little evidence that artificial sweeteners directly affect the onset and mechanisms of obesity, although consuming sweetened products is associated with weight gain in children. Some preliminary studies indicate that consumption of products manufactured with artificial sweeteners is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome, decreased satiety, disturbed glucose metabolism and weight gain, mainly due to increased overall calorie intake, although the numerous factors influencing obesity remain poorly studied, as of 2021.\nCancer.\nMultiple reviews have found no link between artificial sweeteners and the risk of cancer. FDA scientists have reviewed scientific data regarding the safety of aspartame and different sweeteners in food, concluding that they are safe for the general population under common intake conditions.\nMortality.\nHigh consumption of artificially sweetened beverages was associated with a 12% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 23% higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a 2021 meta-analysis. A 2020 meta-analysis found a similar result, with the highest-consuming group having a 13% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 25% higher risk of CVD mortality. However, both studies also found similar or greater increases in all-cause mortality when consuming the same amount of sugar-sweetened beverages.\nNon-nutritive sweeteners vs sugar.\nThe World Health Organization does not recommend using non-nutritive sweeteners to control body weight, based on a 2022 review that could only find small reductions in body fat and no effect on cardiometabolic risk. It recommends fruit or non-sweetened foods instead.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is situated on the River Avon, north-west of London, south-east of Birmingham and south-west of Warwick. The town is the southernmost point of the Arden area at the northern extremity of the Cotswolds. At the 2021 census Stratford had a population of 30,495.\nStratford was inhabited originally by Britons before Anglo-Saxons and remained a village before the lord of the manor, John of Coutances, set out plans to develop it into a town in 1196. In that same year, Stratford was granted a charter from King Richard I to hold a weekly market in the town, giving it its status as a market town. As a result, Stratford experienced an increase in trade and commerce as well as urban expansion.\nStratford is a popular tourist destination, owing to being the birthplace and burial place of the playwright and poet William Shakespeare, who is widely regarded as the national poet of England. It receives approximately 2.7 million visitors a year. The Royal Shakespeare Company resides in the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.\nEtymology.\nThe name is a combination of the Old English \"str\u01e3t\" (from Latin \"stratum\"), meaning 'street', \"ford\", indicating a shallow part of a river or stream, allowing it to be crossed by walking or driving, and \"avon\" which is a Celtic word for river (Welsh: \"afon\"). The 'street' was a Roman road which connected Icknield Street in Alcester to the Fosse Way. The ford, which has been used as a crossing since Roman times, later became the location of Clopton Bridge.\nA survey of 1251\u201352 uses the name Stratford for the first time to identify Old Stratford and the newer manors. The name was used after that time to describe the area specifically surrounding the Holy Trinity Church and the street of the Old Town.\nHistory.\nRoman.\nThe Stratford area was settled during the Roman period as the area was crossed by a Roman road: archaeological remains of a small Roman town have been found, about northeast of Stratford town centre at Tiddington, now part of Stratford, which was occupied from the 1st to the 5th century AD. The remains of two further probable Roman settlements have been found within a few miles of modern-day Stratford.\nMedieval.\nThe settlement which later became known as Stratford was first inhabited by Anglo-Saxons following their 7th-century invasion of what would become known as Warwickshire, but was then part of the Kingdom of Mercia. It is likely that an Anglo-Saxon monastery existed at the site of what is now Holy Trinity Church, which was founded after the land was acquired by Egwin, the third Bishop of Worcester (693\u2013714). The monastery was likely destroyed by Viking invaders in 1015. The land remained in the ownership of the Bishops of Worcester until the 16th century. The area around Holy Trinity Church is still known as \"Old Town\" as it was the original area of settlement around the monastery. The focus of the settlement at Stratford was later moved north, closer to the river crossing, which was better positioned for trade.\nStratford, then referred to as \"strete ford\", remained a village until the late 12th century when it was developed into a town by lord of the manor, Bishop John of Coutances. Coutances laid out a new town plan in 1196 around north of the original settlement, based on a grid system to expand Stratford and allow people to rent property in order to trade within the town. Coutances granted his new tenants the right to rent property and transmit it at death. This was called burgage tenure. Each development plot or \"burgage\" consisted of around . A charter was granted to Stratford by King Richard I in 1196 which allowed a weekly market to be held in the town, giving it its status as a market town. These two charters, which formed the foundations of Stratford's transformation from a village to a town, make the town of Stratford over 800 years old, the town celebrated\nits 800th anniversary in 1996.\nJohn of Coutances' plans to develop Stratford into a town meant Stratford became a place of work for tradesmen and merchants. By 1252 the town had approximately 240 burgages (town rental properties owned by a king or lord), as well as shops, stalls and other buildings. Stratford's tradesmen established the Guild of the Holy Cross for their business and religious requirements. The guild developed into the town's main institution of local government, and included the most important townsmen, who elected officials to oversee local affairs. They built a Guild Chapel in the 13th century, and a Guildhall and almshouses on Church Street in around 1417. The guild established an educational institution in the late 13th century.\nMany of the town's earliest and most important buildings are located along what is known as Stratford's Historic Spine, which was once the main route from the town centre to the parish church. The route of the Historic Spine begins at Shakespeare's Birthplace in Henley Street. It continues through Henley Street to the top end of Bridge Street and into the High Street where many Elizabethan buildings are located, including Harvard House. The route carries on through Chapel Street where Nash's House and New Place are sited. Opposite New Place was The Falcon Hotel (now Hotel Indigo), at the corner of Scholars Lane. It is a timber-framed house with nearly 100-ft frontage to the street and dating perhaps from the end of the 15th century. The Historic Spine continues along Church Street where the Guild buildings are located dating back to the 15th century, as well as 18th- and 19th-century properties. The route then finishes in the Old Town, which includes Hall's Croft and the Holy Trinity Church.\nDuring Stratford's early expansion into a town, the only access across the River Avon into and out of the town was over a wooden bridge, which was first mentioned in 1235. The bridge could not be crossed at times due to the river rising and was described by antiquarian John Leland as \"a poor bridge of timber and no causeway to it, whereby many poor folks and other refused to come to Stratford when the Avon was up, or coming thither stood in jeopardy of life.\" In 1484, a new masonry arch bridge was built to replace it called Clopton Bridge, named after Hugh Clopton who paid for its construction, a wealthy local man who later became the Lord Mayor of London. The new bridge made it easier for people to trade within Stratford and for passing travellers to stay in the town.\nTudor period.\nThe medieval structures of local governance underwent significant changes during the Tudor period: The Guild of the Holy Cross was abolished in 1547 under King Edward VI's suppression of religious guilds, and the inhabitants of Stratford petitioned the Crown for a charter of incorporation as a borough, which they received in 1553. This allowed the formation a new Town Council which inherited the property and responsibilities of the abolished guild. The Charter of Incorporation refounded Stratford's school as the King Edward VI School\nThe Cotswolds, located close to Stratford, was a major sheep-producing area up until the latter part of the 19th century, with Stratford one of its main centres for the processing, marketing, and distribution of sheep and wool. Consequently, Stratford became a centre for tanning during the 15th\u201317th centuries. Glove making was an important industry, which was at its zenith in the 15th and 16th centuries. As was malting, the processing of grain to turn it into malt.\nJohn Shakespeare, originally a farmer, had moved to Stratford in 1551, from the nearby village of Snitterfield and became a successful glover (glove maker) and businessman, and an official on the Town Council. He met and married Mary Arden a member of the local gentry in around 1557. Together they had eight children, including Stratford's most famous son William Shakespeare in 1564, believed to be at the house now known as Shakespeare's Birthplace.\n17th and 18th centuries.\nStratford was the centre of considerable activity and some fighting during the English Civil War. Being located at the junction of several main roads, it was strategically important for both the Royalist and Parliamentarian armies. Due to its close proximity to the Parliamentarian stronghold of Warwick, Stratford remained under Parliamentarian control for the majority of the conflict, although it was only directly occupied by troops for sporadic intervals. In February 1643, Stratford was occupied by Royalist forces under Colonel Wagstaffe.\nIt was recaptured by Parliamentarians under Lord Brooke on 25 February after an engagement on the nearby road to Warwick. Having secured the town, Brooke returned to Warwick. In one notable incident in February 1643, Stratford's Market Hall, at the site of the current Town Hall, was destroyed after three barrels of gunpowder which were being stored there blew up. From March 1644, until part of the following year, Stratford appears to have been continuously occupied by Parliamentarian troops. There was one further Royalist raid in April 1645.\nA number of famous people passed through Stratford during the conflict, such as Prince Rupert in April 1643. He was at Stratford again in July of that year, when he met the Queen Henrietta Maria, who was travelling through the Midlands and was the guest of honour of Susanna Hall, William Shakespeare's daughter, at New Place. Oliver Cromwell was at Stratford in December 1646, and again in 1651, before the Battle of Worcester.\nDespite Stratford's increase in trade, it barely grew between the middle of the 13th century and the end of the 16th century, with a survey of the town showing 217 houses belonged to the lord of the manor in 1590. Growth continued to be slow throughout the 17th century, with hearth tax returns showing that at most there were approximately 429 houses in the town by 1670. However, more substantial expansion began following several inclosure acts in the late 18th century, with the first and largest development by John Payton who developed land on the north side of the old town, creating several streets including John Street and Payton Street.\nIn 1769, the actor David Garrick staged a major Shakespeare Jubilee over three days which saw the construction of a large rotunda and the influx of many visitors. This contributed to the growing phenomenon of Bardolatry which made Stratford a tourist destination.\nBefore the dominance of road and rail, Stratford was an important gateway to the network of British canals. The River Avon was made navigable through Stratford in 1639, by the construction of locks and weirs, providing Stratford with a navigable link to the River Severn to the south-west and to near Warwick to the north-east, this allowed, in the words of Daniel Defoe \"a very great Trade for Sugar, Oil, Wine, Tobacco, Iron, Lead and in a word, all heavy goods which are carried by water almost as far as Warwick; and in return the corn, and especially the cheese, is brought back from Gloucestershire and Warwickshire to Bristol\".\n19th century to present.\nBetween 1793 and 1816 the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal was built, linking the Avon at Stratford with Birmingham. By the early 19th century, Stratford was a flourishing inland port, and an important centre of trade, with many canal and river wharves along what is now Bancroft Gardens.\nThe first railway in Warwickshire; the Stratford and Moreton Tramway was opened to Stratford in 1826: this was a horse-drawn wagonway, long, which was intended to carry goods between the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal, the rural districts of south Warwickshire and Moreton-in-Marsh. The tramway fell into disuse by the early 1900s, and the tracks were lifted in 1918. A surviving remnant of this is the Tramway Bridge over the River Avon, a brick arch bridge which now carries pedestrians.\nThe first steam railway to reach Stratford was a branch of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway from Honeybourne to the south, which opened in July 1859. This was followed by the Stratford on Avon Railway's branch from Hatton from the north, which opened in October 1860. Both branches initially had separate termini, but they soon agreed to join the two branches and open the current Stratford-upon-Avon railway station, which was opened in July 1861. Both branches later came under the control of the Great Western Railway. The connection of Stratford to the growing national railway network, helped enable the development of the modern tourism industry.\nStratford did not become a major centre of industry during the Industrial Revolution, but some industries did grow up locally: Edward Fordham Flower opened a large canal side brewery in Stratford in 1831. The Flower &amp; Sons Brewery, on Clopton Road survived until 1967, when the company was taken over by Whitbread. Several lime kilns were opened locally, and the manufacture of tarpaulin and oilcloth flourished. The advent of rail transport in the middle of the century caused a major decline in river and canal transport, and the River Avon navigation through Stratford was abandoned in 1875. It was restored as a navigation by volunteers almost a century later in 1974.\nVictorian Stratford's growth as a tourist destination was further enhanced by Edward Fordham Flower and his son Charles Edward Flower, owners of a local brewery business, and important figures in local affairs: Through their campaigning and fundraising efforts, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre was opened on the banks of the Avon in 1879. The original theatre was destroyed by fire in 1926. Its replacement was opened in 1932, designed by Elisabeth Scott, making it the first important building by a woman architect erected in Britain.\nIn 1974, the ancient borough of Stratford was abolished and merged into the much larger Stratford-on-Avon District, and the area of the borough became a successor parish with a town council. That council inherited two long-standing charities, the Guild and College estates, that own property in the town; these assets were transferred to the Stratford Town Trust charity which (as of 2025[ [update]]) awards grants totalling over \u00a32million each year to the local community. \nGovernance.\nStratford-upon-Avon is within the Stratford-on-Avon parliamentary constituency which has been represented by Manuela Perteghella of the Liberal Democrats since 2024. Stratford was within the West Midlands Region constituency of the European Parliament which was represented by seven Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). Stratford is governed by three tiers of local government:\nGeography.\nStratford is south-east of Birmingham. It is close to the northern edge of the Cotswolds, with Chipping Campden to the south. Stratford is around to the north-east of the borders with both Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. Other than those already mentioned, significant towns and villages nearby include Alcester, Wellesbourne, Evesham, Redditch and Henley-in-Arden.\nStratford is divided by the River Avon, with the majority of the town being on the west side of the river, its riverside location means it is susceptible to flooding, including flash floods.\nStratford has several suburbs: The town's urban area encompasses the contiguous sub-villages of Alveston, Shottery and Tiddington, which were formerly independent, but now form part of the civil parish of Stratford, other distinct suburbs of the town include Bishopton, Bridge Town, Clopton and Old Town.\nClimate.\nStratford has a temperate maritime climate, as is usual for the British Isles, meaning extremes of heat and cold are rare. Sunshine hours are low to moderate, with an average of 1,379.2 hours of sunshine annually. Rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year. There is an annual average of , with over falling on 114.1 days per year, according to the 1971\u20132000 observation period.\nStratford's warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of . January is the coldest month, with an average high of . The average summer maximum temperature is . The winter average high is .\nBetween 1959 and 2003, the highest recorded temperature was on 3 August 1990 and the lowest temperature was on 14 January 1982.\nDemographics.\nIn the 2021 census Stratford had a population of 30,495, an increase from 27,894 in the 2011 census and 22,338 in the 2001 census. The town's population has undergone expansion in recent years following government approval to build 800 new homes in Shottery, which included plans for a new relief road. Up to 500 new homes are planned in the Bishopton area of the town, and 270 homes on the Loxley Road.\nIn terms of ethnicity in 2021, 92.7% of Stratford residents were White, 3.3% were Asian, 0.6% were Black, 2.4% were Mixed, 0.2% were Arab and 0.8% were from another ethnic group.\nIn terms of religion, 58.4% of Stratford residents identified as Christian, 38.2% said they had no religion, 1.0% were Muslim, 0.8% were Hindu, 0.5% were Sikh, 0.5% were Buddhists, 0.2% were Jewish, and 0.5% were from another religion.\nEconomy.\nTourism is a major employer, especially in the hotel, hospitality industry and catering sectors. Other industries in the town include boat building and maintenance, bicycles, mechanical and electrical engineering, food manufacture, Information Technology, call centre and service sector activities, a large motor sales sector, industrial plant hire, building suppliers, market gardening, farming, storage and transport logistics, finance and insurance, and a large retail sector.\nMajor employers in the town include the NFU Mutual Insurance Company (and Avon Insurance), Amec Foster Wheeler, Sitel, Tesco, Morrisons, Marks &amp; Spencer, B&amp;Q and Pashley Cycles. There are three theatres run by the prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, which attract large audiences and income for the town.\nTourism.\nThe regular large influx of tourists is the major source of the town's prosperity, receiving between 2.5 million and 3 million visitors annually. Stratford is a major English tourist town due to it being the birthplace of William Shakespeare, who many consider the greatest playwright of all time. In 2010, Stratford-on-Avon District Council spent \u00a3298,000 on tourism promotion, which included the launch of a re-branded official tourism website for the Stratford area called Discover Stratford and a new tourist information centre on Henley Street (though this has since returned to its original location on Bridgefoot). The council also supports an official open-top tour bus service in the town.\nShopping centres.\nApart from the town centre, Maybird Shopping Park, usually referred to locally as \"The Maybird Centre\" or simply \"The Maybird\", is a large shopping centre situated on Birmingham Road, approximately a five-minute drive from the town centre. The Rosebird Centre is a much smaller shopping centre located on Shipston Road, consisting of Waitrose, a pet shop, a drive-thru Costa Coffee and a pharmacy/GP surgery. Bell Court Shopping Centre is in the centre of the town with entrances from Wood St, Ely St, High St &amp; Rother Street. it has several restaurants and shopping offers.\nCulture.\nTheatre.\nThe first real theatre in Stratford was a temporary wooden affair built in 1769 by the actor David Garrick for his Shakespeare Jubilee celebrations of that year to mark William Shakespeare's birthday. The theatre, built not far from the site of the present Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was almost washed away in two days of torrential rain that resulted in terrible flooding. To celebrate the 300th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth in 1864, brewer Charles Edward Flower instigated the building of a temporary wooden theatre, known as the Tercentenary Theatre, which was built in a part of the brewer's large gardens on what is today the site of the new, and temporary, Courtyard Theatre. After three months the Tercentenary Theatre was dismantled, with the timber used for housebuilding purposes.\nIn the early 1870s, Flower gave several acres of riverside land to the local council on the understanding that a permanent theatre be built in honour of Shakespeare's memory, and by 1879 the first Shakespeare Memorial Theatre had been completed. It proved to be a huge success, and by the early 20th century it was effectively being run by the actor/manager Frank Benson. The theatre burned down in 1926, with the then artistic director, William Bridges-Adams, moving all productions to the local cinema.\nAn architectural competition was arranged to elicit designs for a new theatre, with the winner, English architect Elisabeth Scott, creating the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The new theatre, adjoining what was left of the old theatre, was opened by the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, in 1932. The new theatre had many illustrious artistic directors, including the actor Anthony Quayle. Sir Peter Hall was appointed artistic director (designate) in 1959, and formed the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) in 1961.\nThe Royal Shakespeare Company also runs two smaller theatres, the Swan Theatre, which was created in the 1980s out of the shell of the remains of the original Memorial Theatre and is modelled on an Elizabethan theatre, quickly becoming one of the finest acting spaces in the United Kingdom, and The Other Place theatre. Along with the Royal Shakespeare Theatre (RST), the Swan Theatre closed in 2007 for refurbishment and reopened in November 2010. The Other Place, a Black box theatre, was extended to become the temporary RSC Courtyard Theatre, opening in July 2006 and was the home of the RSC while the RST was being refurbished \u2013 its interior is similar to the interior of the refurbished RST. The Courtyard Theatre closed in 2015 and was replaced by The Other Place in March 2016, which returned as a 200-seat studio theatre within the steel extension in which the Courtyard Theatre was located.\nStratford is home to The Bear Pit Theatre which was founded in 2008 as a voluntary organisation. It has 100 seats and is part of the Little Theatre Guild. The Attic Theatre is Stratford-upon-Avon's premiere fringe theatre. Established by husband-and-wife team John-Robert and Catherine Partridge and in 2009, who also run the award-winning Tread The Boards Theatre Company. The venue is located next door to Cox's Yard and hosts an intimate 90-seat auditorium in the Grade 2 listed Attic space.\nThe Waterside Theatre, which is not part of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre complex, re-opened in December 2004, then closed in September 2008. During this span, the theatre housed the Shakespearience visitor attraction. This has now been turned into the Clore Learning Centre, the Royal Shakespeare Company's education and events venue. In 1988, Stratford-upon-Avon was the venue for the disastrous provincial try-out of the ill-fated musical \"Carrie\", based on the Stephen King novel.\nFilming and television.\nThe town is the setting of the 2018 BBC detective show \"\".\nMusic.\nStratford ArtsHouse, previously the Civic Hall, is home to Orchestra of the Swan, a professional chamber orchestra staging up to 10 orchestral concerts with international soloists per year. Kempe Studio of The Rudolf Kempe Society, whose patron is Dame Judi Dench, is based in a house at 58 Waterside called The Muses and hosts musical events and masterclass lessons. No. 1 Shakespeare Street holds regular evenings of live music.\nMuseums and Shakespeare's houses.\nTudor World is a museum which explores the time when Shakespeare lived. It is based in a Grade II* listed town centre Tudor building and is the only museum in the country dedicated to Tudor times. Every week there is a walk around the town with Shakespeare. The Mechanical Art and Design museum, but better known as MAD museum, is a museum in Henley Street of \"brilliant-but-bonkers machines\" made by Kinetic artists. Items on show include mechanised flipbooks and a musical typewriter.\nThere are five houses relating to William Shakespeare's life which are owned and cared for by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. These include Hall's Croft, the one-time home of Shakespeare's daughter, Susanna, and her husband Dr. John Hall and Nash's House, which stands alongside the site of New Place which was owned by Shakespeare himself, wherein he died. In Shottery is Anne Hathaway's Cottage, the home of Shakespeare's wife's family prior to her marriage. Mary Arden's House (Palmer's Farm), the family home of his mother, is in Wilmcote.\nElsewhere in the district are farms and buildings at Snitterfield, that belonged to the family of Shakespeare's father. King Edward VI School, located on the corner of Church Street and Chapel Lane, is a grammar school thought to have been attended by Shakespeare. In 2016, the school room where Shakespeare is believed to have studied opened to visitors.\nLiterature.\nStratford has one library, located in Henley Street within a medieval building. Since 2008, Stratford has hosted the Stratford-upon-Avon Literary Festival, which holds two literary events a year, with one event in spring and a shorter festival in autumn. The festival has talks from celebrity guests, workshops and educational programmes and has become one of the most noted literary festivals in the country, with speakers including: Kirsty Wark, Alan Johnson MP, Baroness Shirley Williams, Tom Kerridge, Sir Tim Rice, John McCarthy, Michael Rosen, Howard Jacobson, Jeffrey Archer, Michael Palin, Jeremy Paxman, Alastair Campbell and Paul Merton.\nShakespeare's celebrations.\nEvery year, Shakespeare's birthday is celebrated in Stratford. The celebration takes place over two days on the weekend closest to 26 April, the date of his christening, and includes musical performances, drama and a parade through the town. In 2016, events were held in Stratford to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death.\nPubs.\nThe Garrick Inn is reputedly the oldest pub in Stratford, with an inn existing on the site since medieval times. The Dirty Duck, located along Waterside, is a popular pub for actors performing at the nearby RSC theatres. For the last ten years, the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has held a cider and beer festival in the town.\nLocal media.\nLocal news and television programmes is provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received either from the Lark Stoke or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters.\nThe town's local radio stations are BBC CWR on 103.7 FM, Capital Mid-Counties on 102 FM, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire on 97.0 FM, and Welcombe Radio, a community based radio station.\nStratford Observer and Stratford Herald are the main local newspapers in the town.\nStreets.\nChurch Street.\nChurch Street, an extension of Chapel St and the High St, has the old frontage of King Edward VI School, the school thought to have been attended by Shakespeare.\nHenley Street.\nHenley Street, one of the town's oldest streets, underwent substantial architectural change between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. John Shakespeare's large half-timbered dwelling, purchased by him in 1556, was in 1564 the birthplace of his son William. According to a descriptive placard provided for tourists there:\nThe property remained in the ownership of William Shakespeare's direct descendants until 1670, when his granddaughter, Elizabeth Barnard, died. As she had no children, Elizabeth left the estate to her relative Thomas Hart, Shakespeare's great-nephew. The main house became a tenanted inn called the \"Maidenhead\" (later the \"Swan and Maidenhead\") following the death of John Shakespeare in 1601. Members of the Hart family continued living in the small adjoining cottage throughout the century.\nAt the end of the 19th century, Edward Gibbs renovated the building to more closely represent the original Tudor farmhouse. Adjacent to Shakespeare's Birthplace stands the Shakespeare Centre, completed in 1964 and not far from the Carnegie Library, opened in 1905. The large half-timbered building, which now comprises numbers 19, 20 and 21, was formerly the \"White Lion Inn\". It is first mentioned in 1603. and was adjoined on the east by a smaller inn called the \"Swan\".\nIn 1745 the latter was purchased by John Payton, who acquired the \"Lion\" five years later and rebuilt the whole premises on a greatly enlarged scale. The work was completed by James Collins of Birmingham, builder, in 1753. Payton \"brought the house into great vogue\" though Byng in 1792 complained that \"at the noted White Lion, I met with nothing but incivility\" (cited from \"Torrington Diaries\" (ed. Andrews), iii, 152).\nPayton was succeeded as innkeeper by his son John, and its reputation as one of the best inns on the Holyhead Road must have contributed not a little to the prosperity of the town. David Garrick stayed at the \"White Lion Inn\" during the Shakespeare Jubilee of 1769. and George IV, as Prince Regent, visited it when he came to Stratford in 1806. Its great days came to an end after John Payton the younger sold it to Thomas Arkell in 1823. The building is now home to the Enchanted Manor Museum at the Creaky Cauldron and Magic Alley; the Box Brownie Caf\u00e9; Doug Brown's Really Good Gift Company; and the Not Just Shakespeare Tourist Information Centre. Henley Street is now a major tourist and shopping precinct with many \"al fresco\" caf\u00e9s and street entertainers.\nScholars Lane.\nScholars Lane, opposite King Edward VI School, was included in the 1196 grid plan. Its original name, first recorded in about 1330, was Tinkers Lane, denoting the street where tinkers would gather on market days to mend pots and pans. It is now mainly residential.\nSheep Street.\nSheep Street runs from Ely Street eastwards to the Waterside. It was a residential quarter in the 16th century, some of the buildings were rebuilt following the fire of 1595, although many, such as Number 40, date from 1480. Formerly a two-story building that was extended in the early twentieth century has a lower story of substantial close-set studding: the upper is of more widely spaced thin vertical timbers. As the name suggests Sheep Street, which leads down from the Town Hall to Waterside and the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, was from early times and until the late 19th century, the area where sheep, brought from the neighbouring Cotswold Hills to be bought and sold. Today it is the restaurant centre of the town.\nThe Shrieves House is one of the oldest still lived in houses in the town and William Shakespeare is said to have based his character of Sir John Falstaff on one of the residents, his godson's uncle. Oliver Cromwell is thought to have stayed here in 1651. He wrote a letter from the town to Lord Wharton on 27 August 1651, before the Battle of Worcester. Behind The Shrieves House is a museum called \"Tudor World\" with recreations of 16th-century life in theatrical settings. Just off Sheep Street is Shrieves Walk, a very quaint walkway with several small independent stores. A Wetherspoons is also on Sheep Street.\nWaterside and Southern Lane.\nThis area of Stratford, which runs from the foot of Bridge Street to Holy Trinity Church and leads directly off Sheep Street and Chapel Lane, runs alongside the River Avon and offers access to the Waterside Theatre and all areas of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The Bancroft Gardens and river area is a very popular place for people watching, enjoying picnics and river activities. Bancroft Gardens also features the Gower Monument, a bronze statue of William Shakespeare flanked by four of his most popular characters. In the summer the River Avon is busy with rowing boats, motor boats and river cruises. The Stratford-upon-Avon Canal is busy with colourful narrowboats passing through or mooring up in the canal basin. There are often jugglers, fire-eaters and magicians entertaining the public on the lawns.\nOn the edge of the gardens is a water fountain, known as the Swan Fountain. It was unveiled in 1996 by Queen Elizabeth II to recognise that Stratford has been a market town since 1196. It is from here the Stratford Town Walk meet every day (even Christmas Day), to offer a guided walking tour of the town. The tour passes the Shakespeare houses, Royal Shakespeare Theatre's, 15th-century timber-framed buildings, William Shakespeare's school and visits Holy Trinity Church where Shakespeare was baptised and is buried. Waterside is also the location of The Dirty Duck pub which is frequented by actors from the nearby RSC theatres, theatre critics and theatregoers.\nOther attractions.\nHarvard House is located at 26 High Street. Other attractions include the Stratford Butterfly Farm, which is on the eastern side of the river Avon and the Bancroft Gardens and Stratford Armouries located three miles () from the centre of Stratford on Gospel Oak Lane. Each year on 12 October, unless this is a Sunday, in which case 11 October, Stratford hosts one of the largest mop fairs in the country. Ten days later, the smaller Runaway fair is held.\nThe Guild Chapel, at the intersection of Church Street and Chapel Lane, had a long association with William Shakespeare's family. The chapel offers a view of fine paintings from the early 1500s which had been covered up during the Reformation to save them from destruction. Centuries later, they were uncovered and are now visible.\nTransport.\nRoad.\nStratford is from the United Kingdom's second largest city, Birmingham, and is easily accessible from junction 15 of the M40 motorway. The A46 road links Stratford with the M40, Warwick and Coventry to the north-east, and Evesham and Ashchurch to the south-west, where it joins the M5 motorway. Until the M40 opened, the A34 passed through the town centre.\nBuses.\nBus services are provided predominantly by Stagecoach in Warwickshire (formerly Midland Red South) and Diamond West Midlands. Routes connect the town with local destinations including Banbury, Coventry, Evesham, Leamington and Redditch.\nRailway.\nStratford now has two railway stations: Stratford-upon-Avon is the main town centre station and Stratford-upon-Avon Parkway lies on the town's north-western outskirts, with park and ride facilities.\nBoth stations are served by the following train operating companies:\nStratford station is now the southern terminus of two branch lines from Birmingham and ; up to 1976, the line formerly continued south of the town to join the Cotswold Line at Honeybourne, until this link was closed and dismantled. \nThere has been a campaign in recent years to restore the Honeybourne link, which would entail rebuilding of track.\nStratford-upon-Avon's railway service has been criticised by the Royal Shakespeare Company and others for its limited direct services to London, which consists of a handful of daily direct trains, with connections available from Leamington Spa. In 2018, the RSC described the services to the station as \"woefully inadequate\" for an international tourist destination.\nUntil 1952, the town was also served by Stratford Old Town railway station of the former Stratford-upon-Avon and Midland Junction Railway.\nWater.\nSeveral companies offer sightseeing cruises along the river Avon and the canal, some using old river barges that have been converted for this use. The town is the terminus of the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal where it meets the river Avon.\nThe manually-powered Stratford-upon-Avon chain ferry was opened in 1937 and links Waterside, roughly halfway between the Royal Shakespeare Theatre and Holy Trinity Church, with the water meadows on the opposite side of the river. It was the last of its kind to be built in Britain.\nCycling.\nThe town has numerous cycle paths, such as the Stratford greenway, a traffic free cycle path, which used to be part of the rail network until the early 1960s; it is now part of the Sustrans National Cycle Network (routes National Cycle Route 5 and National Cycle Route 41). Starting from town, it heads along the river Avon and racecourse towards Welford-on-Avon and Long Marston with a cycle hire and caf\u00e9 available at the start of the Greenway at Seven Meadows Road.\nAir.\nBirmingham Airport is to the north-west, with scheduled flights to many national and international destinations.\nEducation.\nStratford is also home to several institutions set up for the study of Shakespeare, including the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which holds books and documents related to the playwright, and the Shakespeare Institute. William Shakespeare is believed to have studied at King Edward VI School. Previously an all-boys school, from September 2013 up to 25% of the year 12 intake can be girls. It is one of the few remaining grammar schools in England, selecting its pupils exclusively using the 11-plus examination. There is also an all-girls grammar school, Stratford-upon-Avon Grammar School for Girls, colloquially known as 'Shottery School' after its location in the village of Shottery, a short distance from the town centre.\nFinally, there is a non-selective secondary school, Stratford-upon-Avon School, formerly known as the Hugh Clopton Secondary Modern School, which was demolished to make way for the new high school. There are no independent secondary schools in the town, but there are many primary schools, including St. Gregory's Catholic Primary School, Stratford-upon-Avon Primary School (often known locally as \"Broad Street\" due to its location), Bishopton Primary School, Willows Church of England Primary School and Thomas Jolyffe Primary School both state and independent, as well as Stratford-upon-Avon College.\nSport.\nStratford-upon-Avon Rugby Club is situated on Loxley Road at their home ground Pearcecroft. The club fields three senior sides and a colts under 18 team with the 1st XV currently playing in Midlands 1 (West). The club also has a large mini and junior section. Stratford-upon-Avon Cricket Club Ground is by the river Avon opposite the Royal Shakespeare Theatre. The first match recorded there was in 1880. It has hosted first-class games since 1951 and women's One Day Internationals since 2005.\nThe town's 5k parkrun event started in February 2016 and operates on the Recreation Ground every Saturday at 9\u00a0am. A junior parkrun started in June 2019 and takes place every Sunday at 9 am for children aged 4 to 14. Stratford Racecourse is located along the Luddington Road, about one mile from the centre of town which holds 18 meetings every year. It is a National Hunt course with an oval track of approximately a mile and a quarter and is considered to be one of the UK's leading small racecourses. \"Adventure Bike Rider\" (established in 2010) is United Kingdom bimonthly motorcycling newspaper.\nChurches.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotable people.\nWith the Royal Shakespeare Company in the town, many famous actors have at some point lived or stayed in Stratford or the surrounding villages.

They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region at high altitudes. The trees grow tall with a cylindrical trunk and a wide leafy crown. The cones are erect; the leaves grow in tufts of 15\u201345 needle leaves, which can be bright green or blue-green with a waxy coat. When the cones are mature, they disintegrate to release the seeds, which are winged. Both pollen and seeds are wind-dispersed. \nCedars are often planted as ornamental trees in parks and large gardens, while others are grown as bonsai. Cedar wood and cedarwood oil are naturally repellent to moths, and have an attractive, long-persistent scent.\nEtymology.\nThe generic name \"Cedrus\" derives from Old English \"ceder\", from the Latin word \"cedrus\". This in turn is derived from Greek \u03ba\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \"k\u00e9dros\", meaning cedar or juniper. Species of both trees are native to the area where Greek language and culture originated, though as the word \"k\u00e9dros\" does not seem to be derived from any of the languages of the Middle East, it has been suggested the word may originally have applied to Greek species of juniper and was later adopted for species now classified in the genus \"Cedrus\" because of their aromatic woods. The name was similarly applied to citron: the word citrus is derived from the same root. As a loan word in English, cedar had become fixed to its biblical sense of \"Cedrus\" by the time of its first recorded usage in 1000 CE.\nDescription.\nHabit.\nCedars are tall resinous trees growing to tall, rarely to , with a cylindrical trunk and a narrow to wide crown, conical when young but often becoming irregular with age. In some individuals, several main branches may eventually rival the main trunk in size. The bark is pale grey-brown and smooth in young trees, dark grey-brown to blackish and splitting into ridges and scales on older trees.\nFoliage.\nThe shoots are dimorphic, made up of long thin leading shoots from terminal buds, each one accompanied by multiple short lateral shoots. The leaves are evergreen and needle-like, long, arranged in an open spiral phyllotaxis on long shoots and in dense spiral clusters of 15\u201345 together on short shoots; they vary from bright grass-green to dark green to strongly glaucous pale blue-green, depending on the thickness of the white wax layer which protects the leaves from drying out.\nCones.\nCedars are monoecious, with separate male and female cones on the same tree. The seed cones are barrel-shaped, long and 3\u20138\u00a0cm broad, green maturing grey-brown, and, as in \"Abies\", disintegrate at maturity to release the winged seeds. The seeds are long, with a 20\u201330 mm wing; as in \"Abies\", the seeds have two or three resin blisters, containing an unpleasant-tasting resin, thought to be a defence against squirrel predation. Cone maturation takes one year, with pollination in autumn and the seeds maturing at the same time a year later. The pollen cones are slender ovoid, 3\u20138 cm long, produced in late summer, and shed pollen in autumn.\nEvolution.\nFossil history.\nThe oldest fossil of \"Cedrus\" is \"Cedrus penzhinaensis\" known from fossil wood found in Early Cretaceous (Albian) sediments of Kamchatka, Russia. An Early Miocene species, \"Cedrus anatolica\", also from petrified wood and thought to be close to \"C. atlantica\", is known from Turkey.\nPhylogeny.\nCedars have a similar cone structure to firs (\"Abies\") and were traditionally thought to be most closely related to them, but genetic evidence supports a basal position in the whole of the subfamily Abietoideae. \nTaxonomy and internal phylogeny.\nThe genus \"Cedrus\" was described by the German botanist Christoph Jacob Trew in his \"Plantae Selectae Quarum Imagines\" in 1757. The \"Cedrus\" taxa are assigned according to taxonomic opinion to between one and four species. The deodar cedar is sister to the Mediterranean cedars. The Cyprus cedar for example is variously considered to be a variety or subspecies of \"Cedrus libani\", or a species \"C. brevifolia\" in its own right; some evidence from allozymes suggests it may even be embedded within the range of variation in the Turkish cedar. Divergence ages are marked on the cladogram.\nThe species cannot hybridise in nature due to their geographical separation, but when brought together in cultivation, they do so freely. However, because cedars (particularly between the Mediterranean taxa) are so similar to each other, hybrids are notoriously to detect and identify. Hybrids between Atlas and Deodar cedars have been deliberately bred by the Tesi nursery in northern Italy since the 1980s, and were named in 2021 as the cultivar group \"Cedrus\" Tesi Group.\nDistribution and ecology.\nCedars are adapted to mountainous climates; in the Mediterranean, they receive winter precipitation, mainly as snow, and summer drought, while in the western Himalaya, they receive primarily summer monsoon rainfall and occasional winter snowfall. They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region, occurring at altitudes of in the Himalayas and in the Mediterranean. In Lebanon, a small number of cedars of Lebanon survive in protected areas including the Cedars of God near the Qadisha Valley, a World Heritage Site.\nFungal diseases of cedars include canker; collar, crown, and root rot; needle blight; \"Gymnosporangium\" rusts; and sirococcus blight, caused by \"Sirococcus tsugae\", which kills shoots and branches. Cedar trees are robust but become vulnerable to bark beetles in drought conditions. Other pests include the giant conifer aphid, scale insects, and nematodes such as the pine wilt nematode. Caterpillars of the pine processionary moth sometimes make their nests in cedars.\nUses.\nCedars have long been highly valued for their scented, durable, and decay-resistant wood, being in demand for building temples and palaces for over 4,000 years from the period of the Epic of Gilgamesh onwards, the longest record of any conifer in human use. Cultivation of cedars for their wood has an equally long history, with recent genetic and environment studies corroborating local oral mythology and Hittite cuneiform text records that two small geographically isolated populations of Lebanon cedar in northern Anatolia 500 km north of its main native area are of human origin, deliberately planted over 3,200 years ago for cedar wood supply to the nearby capital of the Hittite Empire at Hattusa.\nCedars are popular ornamental trees and are often cultivated in temperate climates where winter temperatures do not fall below \u221225\u00a0\u00b0C. The Turkish cedar is slightly hardier, to \u221230\u00a0\u00b0C or just below. Extensive mortality of planted specimens can occur in severe winters when temperatures fall lower. Cedars are suitable for training as bonsai in varied styles. Cedar wood and cedarwood oil are naturally repellent to moths.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It includes all aspects of overseeing and supervising the business operations of an organization.\nOverview.\nThe administration of a business includes the performance or management of business operations and decision-making, as well as the efficient organization of people and other resources to direct activities towards common goals. In general, \"administration\" refers to the broader management function, including the associated finance, personnel and MIS services.\nAdministration can refer to the bureaucratic or operational performance of routine office tasks, usually internally oriented and reactive rather than proactive. Administrators, broadly speaking, engage in a common set of functions to meet an organization's goals. Henri Fayol (1841\u20131925) described these \"functions\" of the administrator as \"the five elements of administration\". According to Fayol, the five functions of management are planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Without proper business management, a firm cannot utilize its resources properly so, it is the most important term in running a business firm.\nKey skills for business management.\nStrategic thinking, leadership, problem-solving, communication, and the ability to work effectively with a diverse range of people and organizations are among the key skills and competencies required of effective managers. Managers must also be able to balance the needs and interests of various stakeholders, such as employees, customers, shareholders, and the larger community. Management is a critical aspect of any successful organization, and it requires a wide range of skills, knowledge, and expertise. Whether managing a small team or a large corporation, effective management is essential to achieving success and driving growth. Another critical aspect is effectively managing and motivating employees. Managers must be able to foster a positive and productive work environment, as well as recognize and reward employees who contribute to the overall success of the organization. This can include providing opportunities for professional development and growth, as well as establishing clear communication channels and ensuring that everyone understands their role and responsibilities.\nAcademic degrees.\nBachelor of Business Administration.\nThe Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA, B.B.A., BSBA, B.S.B.A., BS, B.S., or B.Sc.), Bachelor of Science in Business, Business Administration, Business Management (BS), or Bachelor of Commerce (Bcom. or BComm) is a bachelor's degree in commerce and business administration. The duration of the degree is four years in the United States and three years in Europe. The degree is designed to give a broad knowledge of the functional aspects of a company and its interconnection, while also allowing for specialization in a particular area. The degree also develops the student's practical, managerial, and communication skills, and business decision-making capability to succeed in the competitive world. Many programs incorporate training and practical experience, in the form of case projects, presentations, internships, industrial visits, and interaction with experts from industry.\nMaster of Business Administration.\nThe Master of Business Administration (MBA or M.B.A.) is a master's degree in business administration with a significant focus on management. The MBA degree originated in the United States in the early-20th century, when the nation industrialized and companies sought scientific approaches to management. The core courses in an MBA program cover various areas of business such as accounting, finance, marketing, human resources, and operations in a manner most relevant to management analysis and strategy. Most programs also include elective courses.\nMaster of Management.\nThe Master of Management (MiM) or Master of Science in Management (MSM) is a postgraduate degree with a focus in business management.\nIn terms of content, it is similar to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree as it contains identical management courses but is open to prospective postgraduate candidates at any level in their career unlike MBA programs that have longer course credit requirements and only accept mid-career professionals.\nDoctor of Business Administration.\nThe Doctor of Business Administration (DBA or DrBA) is a research doctorate awarded on the basis of advanced study and research in the field of business administration. The D.B.A. is a terminal degree in business administration and is equivalent to the Ph.D. in Business Administration.\nPhD in Management.\nThe PhD in Management is the highest academic degree awarded in the study of business management. The degree is intended for those seeking academic research- and teaching-careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.\nDoctor of Management.\nA newer form of a management doctorate is the Doctor of Management (D.M., D.Mgt., DBA, or DMan). It is a doctoral degree conferred upon an individual who is trained through advanced study and research in the applied science and professional practice of management. This doctorate has elements of both research and practice relative to social and managerial concerns within society and organizations.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Priestley\nAn Inspector Calls is a modern morality play and drawing room play written by English dramatist J. B. Priestley, first performed in the Soviet Union in 1945 and at the New Theatre in London the following year. It is one of Priestley's best-known works for the stage and is considered to be one of the classics of mid-20th century English theatre. The play's success and reputation were boosted by a successful revival by English director Stephen Daldry for the National Theatre in 1992 and a tour of the UK in 2011\u20132012.\nThe play is a three-act drama which takes place on a single night on 5 April 1912. The play focuses on the prosperous upper-middle-class Birling family, who live in a comfortable home in the fictional town of Brumley, \"an industrial city in the north Midlands.\" The family is visited by a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who questions the family about the suicide of a working-class woman in her mid-twenties. Long considered part of the repertory of classic drawing-room theatre, the play has also been hailed as a scathing criticism of the hypocrisies of Victorian and Edwardian English society and as an expression of Priestley's socialist political principles. The play is notable amongst students as many British and international schools study it as a prescribed text for the GCSE and IGCSE English Literature courses. It is one of the most commonly selected texts by schools. \nSynopsis.\nThe play is set in 1912 at the Birlings' large home in the fictional industrial town of Brumley. Arthur Birling, a wealthy factory owner, magistrate and local politician, celebrates his daughter Sheila's engagement to Gerald Croft, son of a rival magnate. Also present are Birling's wife Sybil and their son Eric (whose drinking problem the family discreetly ignores). After dinner, Sheila and Sybil leave the dining room to go into the drawing room, while Birling lectures the young men on the importance of self-reliance and looking after one's own, and talks of the bright future that awaits them (which, he believes, will include a knighthood for himself in the next honours list).\nThe evening is interrupted when the maid Edna announces the arrival of a man calling himself Inspector Goole, who explains that earlier that day he had seen the dead body of a young woman named Eva Smith, who had died by drinking disinfectant. He has been given the \"duty\" of investigating her death and the Birlings' involvement in it. He has seen her diary, which mentions members of the Birling family. \nGoole produces a photograph of Smith and shows it to Birling, who confirms that she worked in one of his factories. He reveals he dismissed her for leading a strike action demanding higher wages. Despite acknowledging that he left Smith without a job, Birling denies any responsibility for her death.\nSheila, having been sent by her mother to bring Birling, Eric and Gerald to the drawing room, is shown a photograph of Smith. She explains that once, when she was out shopping with her mother, Sheila saw a dress she liked and tried it on, even though her mother and an assistant thought it was not right for her. Smith, now employed at this shop, also helped with the trying-on. Sheila realised that the dress did not suit her; Smith held the dress against herself, and Sheila could see that it looked much better on her. Seeing Smith smiling at the other assistant, Sheila took umbrage and angrily ordered the manager of the department store to fire her. Sheila's real motivation, which she ashamedly confesses, was the jealousy that she felt towards Smith, perceiving her as prettier than herself. Eric leaves the dining room.\nSybil enters the dining room. The inspector mentions that Smith subsequently used the name Daisy Renton. Gerald is noticeably startled and admits to having met a woman of that name in the Palace Bar, where Smith had resorted to prostitution to sustain herself. Seeing that Smith was hungry and struggling to cope financially, and was out of place there, Gerald gave her money and arranged for her to move temporarily into a vacant flat belonging to one of his friends. Gerald reveals that he began a relationship with Smith over the summer but parted with her after a few months. Sheila, disheartened, returns her engagement ring to Gerald, who leaves the house, saying he will return.\nThe inspector turns his attention to Sybil, a patron of a charity that helps women in difficult situations, which Smith, by then pregnant and destitute, had turned to for help, using the name \"Mrs. Birling\". Sybil, seeing this as a deliberate mockery of herself, convinced the committee to deny her a grant. She argued that Smith had been irresponsible and suggested that she find the father and get him to face his responsibilities; Smith said that she had refused to accept any more money from the father once she knew it had been stolen. Despite vigorous cross-examination from the inspector, Sybil denies any wrongdoing. Goole plays his final card, forcing Sybil to lay the blame on the \"drunken young man\" who had got Smith pregnant. It slowly dawns on the rest of the family, except Sybil, that Eric is the young man in question, and \"Mrs. Birling\" was the first name that had come to Smith's mind because he had fathered her child.\nEric enters, and after brief questioning from Goole, breaks down and admits responsibility for the pregnancy: he had forced himself on Smith after a drinking spree at the Palace Bar. After finding out that Smith was pregnant, Eric stole \u00a350 (around \u00a34,865 in 2025) from his father's business to support her and their child, but she refused the stolen money and cut contact with Eric. Birling and Sybil are outraged by Eric's behaviour, and the evening dissolves into angry recriminations. The inspector reminds the family that actions have consequences and that all people are intertwined in one society, stating: \"if men will not learn that lesson, then they will be taught it in fire and blood and anguish.\" He leaves.\nBirling's greatest worry is the scandal that will arise from Eric's theft of his firm's money, which will come out at the inquest. The family begins to question if \"Goole\" was a real police inspector. Gerald returns and reveals that he had met a police sergeant he knew, who did not know of any police inspector named Goole. To confirm this, Birling makes a phone call to his friend, the chief constable, who confirms that there is no Inspector Goole on the force. Gerald points out that they could not be sure that Goole had shown the same photograph to the different members of the family; there could have been several young women, and they did not know that any of them had died. Gerald phones the infirmary, and they confirm that no one has died there that day, and they have not had a suicide in months. The family concludes that the inspector was a fraud and that they have been the victims of a hoax.\nGerald and the elder Birlings celebrate in relief, but Eric and Sheila continue to rue their own and the others' actions. The phone rings: it is the police, who tell Birling that a young woman has just died on her way to the infirmary in a suspected suicide, and that a policeman is on his way to question the family. The inspector's identity is left unexplained, but it is clear that the family's confessions over the course of the evening have all been true, and that public disgrace will soon befall them.\nCharacters.\nEva Smith/Daisy Renton.\nThe deceased young woman who represents the working class in a capitalist society. She is described as young and pretty, with dark eyes. Her parents were dead, and she had no one to turn to when she was unable to support herself through honest employment.\nInspector Goole.\nApparently a police inspector, sent to investigate a suicide. He seems to be familiar with every detail of the case already, interrogating the family solely to expose their guilt rather than to discover unknown information. Many critics and audiences have interpreted Goole's role as that of an \"avenging angel\" because of his supernatural omniscience and his final warning, and because of his name, which is a homophone of the word \"\". It is suggested in the final scene that a real investigation will follow Goole's, and his purpose has been to warn the family in advance and encourage them to accept responsibility for their wrongdoing. The inspector is the drive for Priestley's socialist views within the play.\nArthur Birling.\nArthur Birling is \"a heavy-looking, rather portentous man in his middle fifties\". He represents the ruling capitalist class, repeatedly describing himself with pride as a \"hard-headed businessman\", and is arguably the main subject of Priestley's social critique. Dominant, arrogant, self-centred, and morally blind, he shows his stubbornness by refusing to take any responsibility for Eva's death. He remains unaffected by the suicide, and his concerns appear to be the avoidance of public scandal, the recovery of the money Eric stole from the company, and the resumption of Sheila and Gerald's engagement, which promises to effect a Croft\u2013Birling merger (which looks likely to bring about a monopoly). Arthur Birling is used by Priestley as a dramatic vehicle to criticise capitalism, the arrogance of the wealthy middle class, and the ignorance of the older generation.\nSybil Birling.\nMrs Birling, \"a rather cold woman\" of about fifty, is Arthur's wife, from a higher social class than his. As the leader of a charitable organisation, she assumes a social and moral superiority over Inspector Goole, whose questioning style she frequently describes as \"impertinent\" and \"offensive\". Like her husband, she refuses to accept responsibility for the death of Eva Smith and is more concerned with maintaining the family's reputation, even going so far as to lie and deny that she recognises Smith's picture. She derides women like Eva as immoral, dishonest, and greedy.\nSheila Birling.\nSheila Birling is the daughter of Arthur and Sybil Birling, and the older sister of Eric. Sheila begins as a naive and self-centred young woman, but becomes the most sympathetic member of the group over the course of the play, revealing insecurity about her appearance, showing remorse for her part in Eva's downfall, and encouraging her family to do the same. By the play's end her social conscience has been awakened and she has a new awareness of her responsibilities to others. She represents the younger generation's break from the selfish behaviour and capitalist views of its elders. Sheila shows her naivety and lack of maturity in the way she reacts to her father. She is quick to apologise, it is clear that she is keen to behave well. She also refers to her father as 'Daddy', a childish term. As the play progresses, Sheila's character develops and she begins to stand up for herself.\nEric Birling.\nEric Birling is the son of Arthur and Sybil Birling and the younger brother of Sheila. Eric is presented as a \"Jack the Lad\" character with a drinking habit, who forced himself on Eva and made her pregnant. He is distanced from the rest of the family and feels he cannot talk to them about his problems. With his sister, he repents of, and accepts responsibility for, the way he treated Eva.\nGerald Croft.\nThe son of Sir George and Lady Croft of Crofts Limited, a friendly competitor of Birling and Company, and the fianc\u00e9 of Sheila. The revelation of Gerald's affair with Eva puts an end to the engagement, though Sheila commends him for his truthfulness and for his initial compassion towards Smith.\nEdna.\nEdna is the maid for the Birling family. \nShe introduces the Inspector into the dining room in Act 1. \nReception and interpretation.\nHighly successful after its first and subsequent London productions, the play is now considered one of Priestley's greatest works, and it has been the subject of a variety of critical interpretations.\nAfter the new wave of social realist theatre in the 1950s and 1960s, the play fell out of fashion and was dismissed as an example of outdated bourgeois \"drawing room\" dramas, but it became a staple of regional repertory theatre. Following several successful revivals (including Stephen Daldry's 1992 production for the National Theatre), the play was \"rediscovered\" and hailed as a damning social criticism of capitalism and middle-class hypocrisy in the manner of the social realist dramas of Shaw and Ibsen. It has been read as a parable about the destruction of Victorian social values and the disintegration of pre-World War I English society, and Goole's final speech has been interpreted variously as a quasi-Christian vision of hell and judgement and as a socialist manifesto.\nThe struggle between the embattled patriarch Arthur Birling and Inspector Goole has been interpreted by many critics as a symbolic confrontation between capitalism and socialism, and it arguably demonstrates Priestley's socialist political criticism of the perceived selfishness and moral hypocrisy of middle-class capitalist society in 1950s Britain. While no one member of the Birling family is solely responsible for Eva's death, together they function as a hermetic class system that exploits neglected, vulnerable women, with each example of exploitation leading collectively to Eva's social exclusion, despair and suicide. The play also arguably acts as a critique of Victorian-era notions of middle-class philanthropy towards the poor, which is based on the presumption of the charity-givers' social superiority and on a severe moral judgement of the \"deserving poor\". The romantic idea of gentlemanly chivalry towards \"fallen women\" is also debunked as being based on male lust and sexual exploitation of the weak by the powerful. In Goole's final speech, Eva Smith is called a representation of millions of vulnerable working-class people, and the speech can be read as a call to action to English society to take more responsibility for working-class people, prefiguring the development of the post-World War II welfare state.\nProductions.\n\"An Inspector Calls\" was first performed in 1945 in two Russian theatres (Moscow's Kamerny Theatre and Leningrad's Comedy Theatre), as a suitable British venue could not be found. Priestley had written the play in a single week and all Britain's theatres had already been booked for the season. The play had its first British production in 1946 at the New Theatre in London with Ralph Richardson as Inspector Goole, Harry Andrews as Gerald Croft, Margaret Leighton as Sheila Birling, Julien Mitchell as Arthur Birling, Marian Spencer as Sybil Birling and Alec Guinness as Eric Birling.\nThe first Broadway production opened at the Booth Theatre on 21 October 1947 and ran for 95 performances until 10 January 1948. The production was staged by Cedric Hardwicke and produced by Courtney Burr and Lassor H. Grosberg. The cast included Melville Cooper as Arthur Birling, John Buckmaster as Gerald Croft, Rene Ray as Sheila Birling, Doris Lloyd as Sybil Birling, Patricia Marmont as Edna, John Merivale as Eric Birling and Thomas Mitchell as Inspector Goole.\nThe play was produced and performed at the Ferdowsi Theatre in Iran in the late 1940s, based on the translation by Bozorg Alavi. It was staged in the first season of the Edinburgh Gateway Company in 1953.\nIn 1986 Richard Wilson directed a production at the Royal Exchange, Manchester, with Geraldine Alexander as Sheila Birling, Hugh Grant as Eric Birling and Graeme Garden as Inspector Goole.\nTom Baker played Inspector Goole in a 1987 production directed by Peter Dews and designed by Daphne Dare that opened at Theatr Clwyd on 14 April then transferred to London's Westminster Theatre on 13 May 1987. The cast included Pauline Jameson as Sybil Birling, Peter Baldwin as Arthur Birling, Charlotte Attenborough as Sheila Birling, Simon Shepherd as Gerald Croft and Adam Godley as Eric Birling.\nA revival of the play by British director Stephen Daldry (produced by PW Productions) opened at the National Theatre's Lyttelton Theatre in September 1992. Daldry's concept was to reference two eras: the 1945 post-war era, when the play was written, and the ostensible historical setting for the work in pre-war 1912; this emphasised the way the character Goole was observing, and deploring, the Birling family's behaviour from Priestley's own cultural viewpoint. It won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Play, and was widely praised for making the work involving and politically relevant for a modern audience. The production is often credited with single-handedly rediscovering Priestley's works and \"rescuing\" him from the reputation of being obsolete and class-bound, although the production had some detractors, including Sheridan Morley, who regarded it as a gimmicky travesty of the author's patent intentions. The success of the production since 1992 has led to a critical reappraisal of Priestley as a politically engaged playwright who offered a sustained critique of the hypocrisy of English society. A Broadway transfer of the production starring Philip Bosco opened at the Royale Theatre (now the Bernard Jacobs Theatre) on 27 April 1994 and played 454 performances. \n The Stephen Daldry production went on a tour of the UK in 2011 and continued to tour into 2020, with Tom Mannion and Liam Brennan among the actors playing Inspector Goole. The production returned to the Playhouse in London's West End in November 2016, with Liam Brennan in the name part. Brennan once again starred as Inspector Goole in a 2022 tour of the UK billed as the production's Thirtieth Anniversary Tour.\nAnother production opened on 25 October 1995 at the Garrick Theatre and ran for six years until its transfer to the Playhouse Theatre in 2001. In 2009 it reopened at the Novello Theatre for a year-long run, followed by another transfer to Wyndham's Theatre in December 2009, running for only four months.\nAdaptations.\nThe play has been adapted to film or television at least eleven times, including:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Resins may be biological or synthetic in origin, but are typically harvested from plants. Resins are mixtures of organic compounds insoluble in water, predominantly terpenes. Technically, resins should not be confused with gums, which consist predominantly of water-soluble polysaccharides, although these two terms are often interchangeable in the less formal context. Common resins include pine oleoresins, amber, hashish, frankincense, myrrh and the animal-derived resin, shellac. Resins are used in varnishes, adhesives, food additives, incenses and perfumes.\nResins protect plants from insects and pathogens, and are secreted in response to injury. Resins repel herbivores, insects, and pathogens, while the volatile phenolic compounds may attract benefactors such as predators of insects that attack the plant.\nComposition.\nMost plant resins are composed of terpenes. Specific components are \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, 3-carene, and sabinene, the monocyclic terpenes limonene and terpinolene, and smaller amounts of the tricyclic sesquiterpenes, longifolene, caryophyllene, and cadinene. Some resins also contain a high proportion of resin acids. Rosins on the other hand are less volatile and consist of diterpenes among other compounds.\nExamples.\nExamples of plant resins include amber, Balm of Gilead, balsam, Canada balsam, copal from trees of \"Protium copal\" and \"Hymenaea courbaril\", dammar gum from trees of the family Dipterocarpaceae, dragon's blood from the dragon trees (\"Dracaena\" species), elemi, frankincense from \"Boswellia sacra\", galbanum from \"Ferula gummosa\", gum guaicum from the lignum vitae trees of the genus \"Guaiacum\", kauri gum from trees of \"Agathis australis\", hashish (Cannabis resin) from \"Cannabis indica\", labdanum from mediterranean species of \"Cistus\", mastic (plant resin) from the mastic tree \"Pistacia lentiscus\", myrrh from shrubs of \"Commiphora\", sandarac resin from \"Tetraclinis articulata\", the national tree of Malta, styrax (a Benzoin resin from various \"Styrax\" species) and spinifex resin from Australian grasses.\nAmber is fossil resin (also called resinite) from coniferous and other tree species. Copal, kauri gum, dammar and other resins may also be found as subfossil deposits. Subfossil copal can be distinguished from genuine fossil amber because it becomes tacky when a drop of a solvent such as acetone or chloroform is placed on it.\nAfrican copal and the kauri gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition.\nRosin.\nRosin is a solidified resin from which the volatile terpenes have been removed by distillation. Typical rosin is a transparent or translucent mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown colour, non-odorous or having only a slight turpentine odour and taste. Rosin is insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether, and hot fatty oils. Rosin softens and melts when heated and burns with a bright but smoky flame.\nRosin consists of a complex mixture of different substances including organic acids named the resin acids. Related to the terpenes, resin acid is oxidized terpenes. Resin acids dissolve in alkalis to form resin soaps, from which the resin acids are regenerated upon treatment with acids. Examples of resin acids are abietic acid (sylvic acid), C20H30O2, plicatic acid contained in cedar, and pimaric acid, C20H30O2, a constituent of galipot resin. Abietic acid can also be extracted from rosin by means of hot alcohol. \nRosin is obtained from pines and some other plants, mostly conifers. Plant resins are generally produced as stem secretions, but in some Central and South American species of \"Dalechampia\" and \"Clusia\" they are produced as pollination rewards, and used by some stingless bee species in nest construction. Propolis, consisting largely of resins collected from plants such as poplars and conifers, is used by honey bees to seal small gaps in their hives, while larger gaps are filled with beeswax.\nPetroleum- and insect-derived resins.\nShellac is an example of an insect-derived resin.\nAsphaltite and Utah resin are petroleum bitumens.\nHistory and etymology.\nHuman use of plant resins has a long history that was documented in ancient Greece by Theophrastus, in ancient Rome by Pliny the Elder, and especially in the resins known as frankincense and myrrh, prized in ancient Egypt. These were highly prized substances, and required as incense in some religious rites.\nThe word \"resin\" comes from French , from Latin \"resin\", which either derives from or is a cognate of the Greek \"resin of the pine\", of unknown earlier origin, though probably non-Indo-European.\nThe word \"resin\" has been applied in the modern world to nearly any component of a liquid that will set into a hard lacquer or enamel-like finish. An example is nail polish. Certain \"casting resins\" and synthetic resins (such as epoxy resin) have also been given the name \"resin\".\nSome naturally derived resins, when soft, are known as 'oleoresins', and when containing benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called balsams. Oleoresins are naturally occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., balsams of Peru and tolu, elemi, styrax, and certain turpentines.\nNon-resinous exudates.\nOther liquid compounds found inside plants or exuded by plants, such as sap, latex, or mucilage, are sometimes confused with resin but are not the same. Saps, in particular, serve a nutritive function that resins do not.\nUses.\nPlant resins.\nPlant resins are valued for the production of varnishes, adhesives, and food glazing agents. They are also prized as raw materials for the synthesis of other organic compounds and provide constituents of incense and perfume. The oldest known use of plant resin comes from the late Middle Stone Age in Southern Africa where it was used as an adhesive for hafting stone tools.\nThe hard transparent resins, such as the copals, dammars, mastic, and sandarac, are principally used for varnishes and adhesives, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins (frankincense, elemi, turpentine, copaiba), and gum resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh, and scammony) are more used for food and incense. The resin of the Aleppo pine is used to flavor retsina, a Greek resinated wine.\nAnimal resins.\nWhile animal resins are not as common as either plant or synthetic resins some animal resins like lac (obtained from \"Kerria lacca\") are used for applications like sealing wax in India, and lacquerware in Sri Lanka.\nSynthetic resins.\nMany materials are produced via the conversion of synthetic resins to solids, such as bisphenol A diglycidyl ether \u2013 a resin converted to epoxy glue upon the addition of a hardener. Silicones are often prepared from silicone resins via room temperature vulcanization. Alkyd resins are used in paints and varnishes and harden or cure by exposure to oxygen in the air.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The City of Johannesburg itself has a population of 5,538,596, while the greater urban agglomeration exceeds 14.8 million, making it a megacity and one of the 100 largest urban areas in the world. Johannesburg is the provincial capital of Gauteng, the wealthiest province in South Africa, and seat of the country's highest court, the Constitutional Court. Situated in the mineral-rich Witwatersrand hills, the city has long been at the epicentre of the international mineral and gold trade. The richest city in Africa by GDP and private wealth, Johannesburg functions as the economic capital of South Africa and is home to the continent's largest stock exchange, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.\nJohannesburg was established in 1886, following the discovery of gold, on what was once farmland. Within a decade, the population surged to over 100,000, driven by the large gold deposits found along the Witwatersrand. Modern Johannesburg is an amalgamation of formerly separate cities, townships and settlements, reflecting apartheid-era spatial segregation policies. Soweto (\"South-Western Townships\"), designated a \"blacks only\" city until 1994, is one of the most historically significant areas for modern South Africa. Home to key anti-apartheid leaders, including Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu, it became the epicenter of the 1976 Soweto Uprising, where peaceful student protests were met with brutal force. In contrast, Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking Indo-South Africans (people of Indian and South Asian descent). Formerly \"white-only\" areas include Sandton, known as \"Africa's richest square-mile\", Randburg and Roodeport.\nEtymology.\nControversy surrounds the origin of the name. There were quite a number of people with the name \"Johannes\" who were involved in the early history of the city. Among them was the principal clerk attached to the office of the surveyor-general Hendrik Dercksen, Christiaan Johannes Joubert, who was a member of the Volksraad and was the Republic's chief of mining. Another was Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger (better known as Paul Kruger), president of the South African Republic (ZAR) from 1883 to 1900. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area, is another possibility.\nPrecise records for the choice of name were lost. Johannes Rissik and Johannes Joubert were members of a delegation sent to England to obtain mining rights for the area. Joubert had a park in the city named after him, and Rissik has his name for one of the main streets in the city where the historically important, albeit dilapidated, Rissik Street Post Office is located. The City Hall is also located on Rissik Street.\nHistory.\nThe region surrounding Johannesburg was originally inhabited by San hunter-gatherers who used stone tools. There is evidence that they lived there up to ten centuries ago. Stone-walled ruins of Sotho\u2013Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal in which Johannesburg is situated.\nBy the mid-18th century, the broader region was largely settled by various Sotho\u2013Tswana communities (one linguistic branch of Bantu-speakers), whose villages, towns, chiefdoms and kingdoms stretched from the Bechuanaland Protectorate (what is now Botswana) in the west, to present day Lesotho in the south, to the present day Pedi areas of the Limpopo Province. More specifically, the stone-walled ruins of Sotho\u2013Tswana towns and villages are scattered around the parts of the former Transvaal province in which Johannesburg is situated.\nMany Sotho\u2013Tswana towns and villages in the areas around Johannesburg were destroyed and their people driven away during the wars emanating from Zululand during the late 18th and early 19th centuries (the mfecane or difaqane wars), and as a result, an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, the Ndebele (often referred to as the Matabele, the name given them by the local Sotho\u2013Tswana), set up a kingdom to the northwest of Johannesburg around modern-day Rustenburg.\nGold rush and naming of the city.\nThe main Witwatersrand gold reef was discovered in June 1884 on the farm Vogelstruisfontein by Jan Gerritse Bantjes, son of Jan Bantjes. This triggered the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg in 1886. The discovery of gold rapidly attracted people to the area, making necessary a name and governmental organisation for the area. Jan, Johan and Johannes were common male names among the Dutch of that time; two men involved in surveying the area for the best location of the city, Christian Johannes Joubert and Johann Rissik, are considered the source of the name by some. Johannes Meyer, the first government official in the area is another possibility. Precise records for the choice of name were lost. Within ten years, the city of Johannesburg included 100,000 people.\nIn September 1884, the Struben brothers discovered the Confidence Reef on the farm Wilgespruit near present-day Roodepoort, which further boosted excitement over gold prospects. The first gold to be crushed on the Witwatersrand was the gold-bearing rock from the Bantjes mine crushed using the Struben brothers stamp machine. News of the discovery soon reached Kimberley and directors Cecil Rhodes and Sir Joseph Robinson rode up to investigate the rumours for themselves. They were guided to the Bantjes camp with its tents strung out over several kilometres and stayed with Bantjes for two nights.\nIn 1884, they purchased the first pure refined gold from Bantjes for \u00a33,000. Incidentally, Bantjes had from 1881 been operating the Kromdraai Gold Mine in the Cradle of Humankind together with his partner Johannes Stephanus Minnaar where they first discovered gold in 1881, and which also offered another kind of discovery\u2014the early ancestors of all mankind. Some report Australian George Harrison as the first to make a claim for gold in the area that became Johannesburg, as he found gold on a farm in July 1886. He did not remain in the area.\nOn 3 October 1886 the name Johannesburg was first used. Surveyor Jos de Villiers surveyed Johannesburg's first neighborhood, Randjeslaagte, between 19 October and 3 November that year.\nGold was earlier discovered some to the east of present-day Johannesburg in Barberton. Gold prospectors soon discovered the richer gold reefs of the Witwatersrand offered by Bantjes. The original miners' camp, under the informal leadership of Col Ignatius Ferreira, was located in the Fordsburg dip, possibly because water was available there, and because of the site's proximity to the diggings. Following the establishment of Johannesburg, the area was taken over by the Transvaal government who had it surveyed and named it Ferreira's Township, today the suburb of Ferreirasdorp. The first settlement at Ferreira's Camp was established as a tented camp and which soon reached a population of 3,000 by 1887. The government took over the camp, surveyed it and named it Ferreira's Township. By 1896, Johannesburg was established as a city of over 100,000 inhabitants, one of the fastest growing cities ever.\nMines near Johannesburg are among the deepest in the world, with some as deep as .\nRapid growth, Jameson Raid and the Second Boer War.\nLike many late 19th-century mining towns, Johannesburg was a rough and disorganised place, populated by white miners from all continents, African tribesmen were recruited to perform unskilled mine work, African women beer brewers cooked for and sold beer to the black migrant workers, a very large number of European prostitutes, gangsters, impoverished Afrikaners, tradesmen, and the \"AmaWasha\", Zulu men who surprisingly dominated laundry work. As the value of control of the land increased, tensions developed between the Boer\u2013dominated Transvaal government in Pretoria and the British, culminating in the Jameson Raid that ended in fiasco at Doornkop in January 1896. The Second Boer War (1899\u20131902) saw British forces under Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts, occupy the city on 30 May 1900 after a series of battles to the south-west of its then-limits, near present-day Krugersdorp.\nFighting took place at the Gatsrand Pass (near Zakariyya Park) on 27 May, north of Vanwyksrust\u2014today's Nancefield, Eldorado Park and Naturena\u2014the next day, culminating in a mass infantry attack on what is now the waterworks ridge in Chiawelo and Senaoane on 29 May.\nDuring the Boer war, many African mineworkers left Johannesburg creating a labour shortage, which the mines ameliorated by bringing in labourers from China, especially southern China. After the war, they were replaced by black workers, but many Chinese stayed on, creating Johannesburg's Chinese community, which during the apartheid era, was not legally classified as \"Asian\", but as \"Coloured\". The population in 1904 was 155,642, of whom 83,363 were whites.\nPost-Union history.\nIn 1917, Johannesburg became the headquarters of the Anglo-American Corporation founded by Ernest Oppenheimer which ultimately became one of the world's largest corporations, dominating both gold-mining and diamond-mining in South Africa. Major building developments took place in the 1930s, after South Africa went off the gold standard. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Hillbrow went high-rise. In the 1950s and early 1960s, the apartheid government constructed the massive agglomeration of townships that became known as Soweto. New freeways encouraged massive suburban sprawl to the north of the city. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, tower blocks (including the Carlton Centre and the Southern Life Centre) filled the skyline of the central business district.\nThe system of apartheid, a comprehensive system of racial separation was imposed upon South Africa starting in 1948. For its growth, the economy of Johannesburg depended upon hundreds of thousands of skilled white workers imported from Europe and semi- and un-skilled black workers imported from other parts of Southern Africa. Though they worked together they were forced by the government to live separately. Work was considered to be an exception to apartheid in order to keep Johannesburg functioning as South Africa's economic capital.\nIn the 1950s, the government began a policy of building townships for black families (prior to this unskilled workers were asked to work on \"single status\" in male-only hostels at the mines and had to commute to see their families in whatever province they originated) outside of Johannesburg to provide workers for Johannesburg. Soweto, a township founded for black workers coming to work in the gold mines of Johannesburg, was intended to house 50,000 people, but soon was the home of ten times that number as thousands of unemployed rural blacks came to Johannesburg for employment and an income to send back to their villages. It was estimated that in 1989, the population of Soweto was equal to that of Johannesburg, if not greater.\nIn March 1960, Johannesburg witnessed widespread demonstrations against apartheid in response to the Sharpeville massacre. On 11 July 1963, the South African Police raided a house in the Johannesburg suburb of Rivonia where nine members of the banned African National Congress (ANC) were arrested on charges of planning sabotage. Their arrest led to the famous Rivonia Trial. The nine arrested included one Indo-South African, one coloured, two whites and five blacks, one of whom was the future president Nelson Mandela. At their trial, the accused freely admitted that they were guilty of what they were charged with, namely of planning to blow up the hydro-electric system of Johannesburg to shut down the gold mines, but Mandela argued to the court that the ANC had tried non-violent resistance to apartheid and failed, leaving him with no other choice. The trial made Mandela into a national figure and a symbol of resistance to \"apartheid\".\nOn 16 June 1976, demonstrations broke out in Soweto over a government decree that black school-children be educated in Afrikaans instead of English, and after the police fired on the demonstrations, rioting against apartheid began in Soweto and spread into the greater Johannesburg area. About 575 people, the majority of whom were black, were killed in the Soweto uprising of 1976. Between 1984 and 1986, South Africa was in turmoil as a series of nationwide protests, strikes and riots took place against apartheid, and the black townships around Johannesburg were scenes of some of the fiercest struggles between the police and anti-apartheid demonstrators.\nThe central area of the city underwent something of a decline in the 1980s and 1990s, due to the high crime rate and when property speculators directed large amounts of capital into suburban shopping malls, decentralised office parks, and entertainment centres. Sandton City was opened in 1973, followed by Rosebank Mall in 1976, and Eastgate in 1979.\nDuring the 1990s, the city faced rapid growth of crime throughout large parts of the city. Some areas of skyscrapers were abandoned, many residents left their homes, and businesses moved out. Some historical buildings in central areas were destroyed by fires that spread relentlessly.\nTwenty-first century.\nThe end of apartheid saw the administrative unification of Johannesburg's apartheid-era city proper with surrounding townships and settlements into the City of Johannesburg Metropolitan Municipality. However, the spatial legacy of apartheid has proven difficult to overcome and Johannesburg remains among the most unequal cities in the world.\nIn 2025, Johannesburg remained the world's fifth most dangerous city by crime rate. Attempts to revive Johannesburg's CBD, most notably in the Maboneng District, have failed to halt the rising crime rate and infrastructure deterioration in the inner city. Abandoned buildings in the city's Hillbrow district have been increasingly captured by gangs and on 31 August 2023, at least 76 people died when a hijacked building caught fire in Johannesburg. In March 2025, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa launched a rescue plan to address the city's \"rapidly declining infrastructure\".\nSince 1994, Johannesburg has further seen increased incidents of xenophobic violence against migrants from other African countries. On 12 May 2008, a series of riots started in the township of Alexandra, in the north-eastern part of Johannesburg, when locals attacked migrants from Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, killing two people and injuring 40 others. These riots sparked the nationwide xenophobic attacks of 2008, which saw 60 more killings and widespread destruction of immigrant properties. The 2015 and 2019 Johannesburg riots similarly displayed outbreaks of mass violence against migrants.\nModern Johannesburg has hosted a number of international summits and sport events. The 2010 FIFA World Cup final took place at FNB Stadium, the largest stadium in Africa, while the World Cup closing ceremony on the next day saw the final public appearance of Nelson Mandela. In 2015, Johannesburg hosted the African Union Summit, which sparked international outrage as South Africa aided the arrival and escape of Omar al-Bashir despite an international arrest warrant for war crimes by the International Criminal Court. In 2018, Johannesburg hosted the 10th BRICS Summit and in 2023 the 15th BRICS summit. The 2025 G20 Johannesburg Summit will see heads of state and government convene for the first G20 Presidency of an African country.\nGeography.\nTopography.\nJohannesburg is located in the eastern plateau area of South Africa known as the Highveld, at an elevation of . The former Central Business District is located on the southern side of the prominent ridge called the Witwatersrand (English: White Water's Ridge) and the terrain falls to the north and south. By and large the Witwatersrand marks the watershed between the Limpopo and Vaal rivers as the northern part of the city is drained by the Jukskei River while the southern part of the city, including most of the Central Business District, is drained by the Klip River. The north and west of the city has undulating hills while the eastern parts are flatter.\nJohannesburg may not be built on a river or harbour, but its streams contribute to two of southern Africa's mightiest rivers, the Limpopo and the Orange. Most of the springs from which many of these streams emanate are now covered in concrete and canalised, accounting for the fact that the names of early farms in the area often end with \"fontein\", meaning \"spring\" in Afrikaans. Braamfontein, Rietfontein, Zevenfontein, Doornfontein, Zandfontein and Randjesfontein are some examples. When the first white settlers reached the area that is now Johannesburg, they noticed the glistening rocks on the ridges, running with trickles of water, fed by the streams\u2014giving the area its name, the Witwatersrand, \"the ridge of white waters\". Another explanation is that the whiteness comes from the quartzite rock, which has a particular sheen to it after rain.\nThe site was not chosen for its streams, however. The main reasons the city was founded where it stands today was because of the gold. Indeed, the city once sat near massive amounts of gold, given that at one point the Witwatersrand gold industry produced forty per cent of the planet's gold.\nParks and gardens.\nParks and gardens in Johannesburg are maintained by Johannesburg City Parks and Zoo. City Parks is also responsible for planting the city's many green trees, making Johannesburg one of the 'greenest' cities in the world. It has been estimated that there are six million trees in the city with the number growing every year\u20141.2\u00a0million on pavements and sidewalks, and a further 4.8\u00a0million in private gardens. City Parks continues to invest in planting trees, particularly those previously disadvantaged areas of Johannesburg which were not positive beneficiaries of apartheid Johannesburg's urban planning. Johannesburg Botanical Garden, located in the suburb of Emmarentia, is a popular recreational park.\nJohannesburg and environs also offer various options to visitors wishing to view wildlife, in addition to the Johannesburg Zoo, one of the largest in South Africa. The Lion Park nature reserve, next to Lesedi Cultural Village, is home to over 80 lions and various other game, while the Krugersdorp Nature Reserve, a 1500 ha game reserve, is a forty-minute drive from the city centre. The De Wildt Cheetah Centre in the Magaliesberg runs a successful breeding program for cheetah, wild dog and other endangered species. The Rhino &amp; Lion Nature Reserve, situated in the \"Cradle of Humankind\" on 1200 ha of \"the typical highveld of Gauteng\" also runs a breeding programme for endangered species including Bengal tigers, Siberian tigers and the extremely rare white lion. To the south, from the city centre, is the Klipriviersberg Nature Reserve home to large mammals and hiking trails. Separating Lenasia and the Soweto suburbs is the Olifantsvlei Nature Reserve protected area.\nClimate.\nJohannesburg is situated on the highveld plateau, and has a subtropical highland climate (K\u00f6ppen \"Cwb\"). The city enjoys a sunny climate, with the summer months (October to April) characterised by hot days followed by afternoon thundershowers and cool evenings, and the winter months (May to September) by dry, sunny days followed by cold nights. Temperatures in Johannesburg are usually fairly mild due to the city's high elevation, with an average maximum daytime temperature in January of , dropping to an average maximum of around in June. The UV index for Johannesburg in summers is extreme, often reaching 14\u201316 due to the high elevation and its location in the subtropics.\nWinter is the sunniest time of the year, with mild days and cool nights, dropping to in June and July. The temperature occasionally drops to below freezing at night, causing frost. Snow is a rare occurrence, with snowfall having been experienced in the twentieth century during May 1956, August 1962, June 1964 and September 1981. In the 21st century, there was light sleet in 2006, as well as snow proper on 27 June 2007 (accumulating up to in the southern suburbs), 7 August 2012, and 10 July 2023.\nRegular cold fronts pass over in winter bringing very cold southerly winds but usually clear skies. The annual average rainfall is , which is mostly concentrated in the summer months. Infrequent showers occur through the course of the winter months. The lowest nighttime minimum temperature ever recorded in Johannesburg is , on 13 June 1979. The lowest daytime maximum temperature recorded is , on 19 June 1964.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAccording to the 2022 South African National Census, the population of Johannesburg is 4,803,262 people, making it the most populous city in South Africa (it has been the most populous city in South Africa since at least the 1950s). From the 2001 census, the people live in 1,006,930 formal households, of which 86% have a flush or chemical toilet, and 91% have refuse removed by the municipality at least once a week. 81% of households have access to running water, and 80% use electricity as the main source of energy. 29% of Johannesburg residents stay in informal dwellings. 66% of households are headed by one person.\nJohannesburg's urban agglomeration spreads well beyond the administrative boundary of the municipality. The population of the whole area has been estimated to be variously at 7,860,781 in 2011 by \"citypopulation.de\". Johannesburg's suburbs are the product of urban sprawl and are regionalised into north, south, east and west, and they generally have different personalities. Greater Johannesburg consists of more than five hundred suburbs in an area covering more than . Although black Africans can be found throughout Johannesburg and its surrounding area, greater Johannesburg remains highly racially segregated.\nWithin the Metropolitan Municipality, the old centre, established in 1886 and given city status in 1928, has been listed in recent censuses as a \"main place\". As of 2011[ [update]], this main place had a population of 957,441 and an area of 334.81\u00a0km2. Some authors consider the metropolitan area to include most of Gauteng province. The UN's Population Division in 2016 estimated the metropolitan area population to be 9,616,000.\nBlacks account for 73% of the population, followed by whites at 18%, coloureds at 6% and Asians at 4%. 42% of the population is under the age of 24, while 6% of the population is over 60 years of age. 37% of city residents are unemployed. 91% of the unemployed are Black African. Women comprise 43% of the working population. 19% of economically active adults work in wholesale and retail sectors, 18% in financial, real estate and business services, 17% in the community, social and personal services and 12% are in manufacturing. Only 0.7% work in mining.\nReligion.\n53% belong to mainstream Christian churches, 24% are not affiliated with any organised religion, 14% are members of African Independent Churches, 3% are Muslim, 1% are Jewish and 1% are Hindu. There are Muslim mosques, Hindu temples, a Sikh Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in Sandton and a large number of synagogues.\nChristianity.\nPlaces of worship in Johannesburg are predominantly Christian churches: Serbian Orthodox Church, Zion Christian Church, Apostolic Faith Mission of South Africa, Assemblies of God, Baptist Union of Southern Africa (Baptist World Alliance), Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK), Methodist Church of Southern Africa (World Methodist Council), Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Church of Africa (World Communion of Reformed Churches), Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Johannesburg (Catholic Church) and the Johannesburg South Africa Temple (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints).\nAlbert Street Methodist Church in central Johannesburg is historically significant for its role as a refuge for anti-apartheid activists, including Albertina Sisulu.\nJudaism.\nMost of Johannesburg's estimated 50,000 Jews live in the North Eastern suburbs; Glenhazel, Raedene Estate, Kew, Norwood, Highlands North, Sandringham, Savoy Estate, Waverley, Orchards, Oaklands and Fairmount. There are many Orthodox synagogues in the city including; Great Park Synagogue, Oxford Shul and Doornfontein Synagogue. There is a smaller number of synagogues serving the city's Reform Jews, including Temple Israel and Beit Emanuel.\nLanguages.\n32% of Johannesburg residents speak Nguni languages at home, 24% speak Sotho languages, 18% speak English, 7% speak Afrikaans and 6% speak Tshivenda.\nEducation.\nJohannesburg has a well-developed higher education system of both private and public universities. Johannesburg is served by the public universities University of the Witwatersrand and the University of Johannesburg.\nUniversity of Johannesburg was formed on 1 January 2005, when three separate universities and campuses\u2014Rand Afrikaans University, Technikon Witwatersrand, and the Johannesburg campuses of Vista University\u2014were merged. The new university offers education primarily in English and Afrikaans, although courses may be taken in any of South Africa's official languages.\nThe University of the Witwatersrand is one of the leading universities in Africa, and is famous as a centre of resistance to apartheid. It is attached to one of the world's largest hospitals, the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital, located in Soweto.\nThe University of Pretoria's business school the Gordon Institute of Business Science is located in Illovo, Johannesburg.\nMany private colleges are also situated in Johannesburg, such as Damelin, CTI, Lyceum College and the South African campus of Monash University (six of the other campuses are in Australia, while the eighth is in Malaysia), as well as the Midrand Graduate Institute which is located in Midrand.\nJohannesburg also has one of several film schools in the country, one of which has won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Student Film in 2006. The South African School of Motion Picture and Live Performance, or AFDA for short, is situated in Auckland Park.\nJohannesburg also has three teacher-training colleges and a technical college. There are numerous kindergartens, primary schools and high schools in the region.\nEconomy.\nJohannesburg is the economic and financial hub of South Africa, producing 16% of South Africa's gross domestic product, and accounts for 40% of Gauteng's economic activity. In a 2008 survey conducted by Mastercard, Johannesburg ranked 47 out of 50 top cities in the world as a worldwide centre of commerce (the only city in Africa).\nMining was the foundation of the Witwatersrand's economy, but its importance is gradually declining due to dwindling reserves and service and manufacturing industries have become more significant to the city's economy. While gold mining no longer takes place within the city limits, most mining companies still have their headquarters in Johannesburg. The city's manufacturing industries extend across a range of areas and there is still a reliance on heavy industries including steel and cement plants. The service and other industries include banking, IT, real estate, transport, broadcast and print media, private health care, transport and a vibrant leisure and consumer retail market. Johannesburg has Africa's largest stock exchange, the JSE although it has moved out of the central business district. Due to its commercial role, the city is the seat of the provincial government and the site of a number of government branch offices, as well as consular offices and other institutions.\nThe Witwatersrand urban complex is a major consumer of water in a dry region. Its continued economic and population growth has depended on schemes to divert water from other regions of South Africa and from the highlands of Lesotho, the biggest of which is the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, but additional sources will be needed early in the 21st century.\nThe container terminal at City Deep is known to be the largest \"dry port\" in the world, with some 50% of cargo that arrives through the ports of Durban and Cape Town arriving in Johannesburg. The City Deep area has been declared an IDZ (industrial development zone) by the Gauteng government.\nRetail.\nJohannesburg's largest shopping centres, measured by gross leasable area (GLA, the uniform measure of centre size as determined by the International Council of Shopping Centers) are Sandton City, Eastgate, Mall of Africa, Westgate and Cresta. Melrose Arch is one of its most prestigious. Other centres include Hyde Park Corner, Rosebank, Southgate, The Glen Shopping Centre, Johannesburg South, and Clearwater Mall. There were also plans to build a large shopping centre, known as the Zonk'Izizwe Shopping Resort, in Midrand, but these have been indefinitely delayed due to the opening of Mall of Africa. \"Zonk'Izizwe\" means \"All Nations\" in Zulu language, indicating that the centre will cater to the city's diverse mix of peoples and races. Also a complex named Greenstone in Modderfontein has been opened. Cradlestone Mall is a new mall named for its location which is close to the Cradle of Humankind, a World Heritage Site.\nLaw and government.\nGovernment.\nUpon the creation of the Metropolitan Municipality in 2000 the city was subdivided into eleven regions, simply named Region 1 to Region 11. These were reorganised in 2006 into the current seven regions named alphabetically Region A to Region G, as shown on the nearby map.\nAs of 2006[ [update]] the seven regions are:\nIn the 2016 municipal elections, the ruling party, the ANC, lost their majority in Johannesburg for the first time since taking power in 1994, claiming only 44.12% of the vote. The Economic Freedom Fighters and Democratic Alliance both agreed to vote for the DA mayoral candidate, Herman Mashaba, who was sworn into power as the first Democratic Alliance mayor of Johannesburg on 22 August 2016. The ANC returned to the city's executive on 4 December 2019 following the election of its regional chair, Geoff Makhubo, to the mayoralty. Makhubo died on 9 July 2021 and Eunice Mgcina was appointed acting mayor. A new mayor, Jolidee Matongo, was elected unopposed on 10 August 2021. Matongo died in a car accident in September 2021 and Mpho Moerane was elected to succeed him.\nCrime.\nAfter the Group Areas Act was scrapped in 1991, Johannesburg was affected by urban blight. Thousands of poor black people, who had been forbidden to live in the city proper, moved into the city from surrounding black townships like Soweto and many immigrants from economically beleaguered and wartorn African nations flooded into South Africa. Many buildings were abandoned by landlords, especially in high-density areas, such as Hillbrow. Many corporations and institutions, including the stock exchange, moved their headquarters away from the city centre, to suburbs like Sandton.\nReviving the city centre is one of the main aims of the municipal government of Johannesburg. Drastic measures have been taken to reduce crime in the city. These measures include closed-circuit television on street corners. As of 11 December 2008, every street corner in Johannesburg central is under high-tech CCTV surveillance. The CCTV system, operated by the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD), is also able to detect stolen or hijacked vehicles by scanning the number plates of every vehicle travelling through the central business district (CBD), then comparing them to the eNaTIS database. The JMPD claims that the average response time by police for crimes committed in the CBD is 60 seconds.\nCrime levels in Johannesburg have dropped as the economy has stabilised and begun to grow. Between 2001 and 2006, R9-billion (US$1.2\u00a0billion) has been invested in the city centre. Further investment of around R10-billion (US$1.5\u00a0billion) is expected in the city centre alone by 2010. This excludes development directly associated with the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In an effort to prepare Johannesburg for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, local government enlisted the help of Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, to help bring down the crime rate, as the opening and closing matches of the tournament were played in the city.\nMurders in the Johannesburg municipality amounted to 1,697 in 2007 according to the South African Medical Research Council, a rate of 43 per 100,000 inhabitants. In 2016 that number had sharply declined to 29.4 per 100,000 inhabitants, placing the murder rate at more than half of that of Cape Town and even below the national average.\nArts and culture.\nJohannesburg is a cultural hub in South Africa and has a wide variety of cultural venues, making it a prominent area for many creative and cultural industries. Johannesburg is home to the National School of Arts, The University of Witwatersrand's School of the Arts and the South African Ballet Theatre, as well as cultural precincts such as Mary Fitzgerald Square and numerous other museums, theatres, galleries and libraries. The Johannesburg City Library is located in the Central Business District of Johannesburg.\nMuseums and galleries.\nThe Johannesburg Art Gallery (JAG) is widely considered among the most notable collections of fine art on the African continent, featuring European and African art from the 15th century to the present. Wits Art Museum in Braamfontein specializes in historic and contemporary African art. Johannesburg is further home to an array of noteworthy private collections and art galleries, largely located in the northern suburbs. These include the Joburg Contemporary Art Foundation (JCAF), Goodman Gallery, Gallery MOMO and the Standard Bank Art Gallery.\nSeveral museums were established since 1994 to remember and educate on South Africa's political history. These include the Apartheid Museum, Constitution Hill, Hector Pieterson Museum and Mandela House. Further, Museum Africa is dedicated to showcasing the continent's history through its Africana collection. Other historical museums include the South African National Museum of Military History, the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre and the Workers Museum. The Origins Centre at the University of the Witwatersrand explores the history of humankind and features exhibitions on African sand and rock art.\nSpecialist museums and collections cover subjects such as Africana, costume, design, fossils, geology, military history, medical, pharmacy, photography and transportation networks such as railways. Notably, the James Hall Museum of Transport features the largest collection on the topic in Africa. Other specialist collections include the AECI Dynamite Factory Museum, the Adler Museum of Medicine, the Credo Mutwa Cultural Village, Madiba Freedom Museum, Bernberg Fashion Museum, and the Zoology Museum.\nEntertainment and performing arts.\nJohannesburg hosts many of South Africa's premier music events, such as RAMFest's Johannesburg leg, In The City and many international tours from bands and artists around the world. Several critically acclaimed musical acts come from Johannesburg, such as Kongos, Johnny Clegg, Trevor Rabin, Zebra &amp; Giraffe, Man As Machine, The Parlotones, and ShortStraw.\nThe Joburg Theatre complex hosts drama, opera and ballet.\nThe Market Theatre Foundation houses the historic Market Theatre in Newtown with various sized stages holding performances from theatre to music and dance. The foundation also oversees the https:// and https:// \u2013 run training programmes for young creatives and presenting work to the public.\nPublic art.\nPublic art ranges from sculptures to murals to pieces by artists like William Kentridge and Gerhard Marx's Fire Walker. Many pieces are developed through community workshops, such as the Vilakazi Street sculptures. Others are functional, such as street furniture found in Hillbrow and the city centre.\nAs part of the Johannesburg Development Agency's (JDA) policy to make city areas desirable to potential investors, the organisation has identified public art as a way to improve the urban experience of the city. The JDA spends 1 percent of all projects of over R10-million on public art.\nArchitecture and urbanism.\nJohannesburg is home to some of Africa's tallest structures, such as the Sentech Tower, Hillbrow Tower, the Carlton Centre and Ponte City Apartments. The Johannesburg city skyline has most of the tallest buildings on the continent and contains most international organisations such as IBM, Absa, BHP, Willis Group, First National Bank, Nedbank and Standard Bank. Many of the city's older buildings have been demolished and more modern ones built in their place. North of the CBD is Hillbrow, the most densely populated residential area in southern Africa. Northwest of the CBD is Braamfontein, a secondary CBD housing many offices and business premises. The CBD is predominated by four styles of architecture, being Victorian Colonial, Edwardian Baroque, Art Deco and Modernism.\nThe city is often described as Africa's economic powerhouse, and contentiously as a modern and prosperous African city. Johannesburg, like many metropolises, has more than one central business district (CBD), including, but not limited to, Sandton, Rosebank and Roodepoort in addition to the original CBD. Some tend to include Benoni and Germiston as well.\nDue to its many different central districts, Johannesburg would fall under the multiple nuclei model in human geography terms. It is the hub of South Africa's commercial, financial, industrial, and mining undertakings. Johannesburg is part of a larger urban region. It is closely linked with several other satellite towns. Randburg and Sandton form part of the northern area. The east and west ridges spread out from central Johannesburg. The Central Business District covers an area of . It consists of closely packed skyscrapers such as the Carlton Centre, Marble Towers, Trust Bank Building, Ponte City Apartments, Southern Life Centre and 11 Diagonal Street.\nJohannesburg's city centre retains its elements of a rectangular grid pattern that was first officially recorded in 1886. Streets are narrow and filled with high rises built in the mid- to late 1900s. Old Victorian\u2013era buildings first built in the late 1800s have been torn down long ago. The 1900s brought along with it the introduction of many different architectural styles and structures. The Johannesburg Art Gallery and Supreme Court Building being two examples. These were important Beaux-Arts structures, with the style put in place by (at the time) colonial parent, the British Empire. South Africa did not borrow architectural techniques exclusively from Britain, however. They were also inspired by American models and styles, having built several structures like the ESKOM Building and the Corner House to emulate the prowess of New York City, located in the United States.\nSports.\nJohannesburg's most popular sports by participation are association football, cricket, rugby union, and running. Early each Sunday morning, tens of thousands of runners gather to take part in informal runs organised by several athletic clubs.\nThe city has several football clubs in the Premiership and the National First Division. In the Premiership, the top Johannesburg teams are all fierce rivals and include Kaizer Chiefs (nicknamed \"Amakhosi\") and Orlando Pirates (nicknamed the \"Buccaneers\"). They are based at the city's FNB and Orlando stadiums. Several large-scale league and cup games are played at Soccer City the venue of the 2010 FIFA World Cup final. First Division teams are Jomo Cosmos and FC AK. Katlehong City and Alexandra United, play at Alexandra and Reiger Park stadium respectively.\nCricket is one of the more popular sports. In cricket, the Highveld Lions represent Johannesburg, the rest of Gauteng as well as the North West at the Wanderers Stadium which was the venue for the 2003 Cricket World Cup Final in which Australia successfully defended their title against India. Wanderers Stadium hosted what many cricket fans consider the greatest ever ODI match in which South Africa successfully chased down 434 runs. They take part in the first class SuperSport Series, the one-day MTN Domestic Championship and the Twenty20 Ram Slam T20 Challenge. Johannesburg also hosted matches from and the final of the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, in which India beat Pakistan in the final.\nThe Lions, formerly the Cats, represent Johannesburg, North West and Mpumalanga in the United Rugby Championship competition, which includes teams from South Africa, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales. The Golden Lions compete in the Currie Cup, which they have won on ten occasions. They are housed at Ellis Park Stadium, which also hosted the 1995 Rugby World Cup final, in which the South African Springboks defeated the New Zealand All Blacks.\nThe city's Ticketpro Dome and the Ellis Park Arena hosted two of the three NBA Africa Games.\nInfrastructure.\nTransportation.\nJohannesburg is a young and sprawling city, with its public transportation built in its infancy, geared towards private motorists, and lacks a convenient public transportation system. The City though has invested a large percentage of its budget toward an effective integrated public transportation system. A significant number of the city's residents are dependent on the city's informal minibus taxis.\nRoads.\nJohannesburg shares a network of metropolitan routes with Krugersdorp and Ekurhuleni. The fact that Johannesburg is not near a large navigable body of water has meant that ground transportation has been the most important method of transporting people and goods in and out of the city. One of Africa's most famous \"beltways\" or ring roads/orbitals is the Johannesburg Ring Road. The road is composed of three freeways that converge on the city, forming an loop around it: the N3 Eastern Bypass, the N1 Western Bypass and the N12 Southern Bypass. The N3 was built exclusively with asphalt, while the N12 and N1 sections were made with concrete, hence the nickname given to the N1 Western Bypass, \"The Concrete Highway\". In spite of being up to 12 lanes wide in some areas, the Johannesburg Ring Road is frequently clogged with traffic. The Gillooly's Interchange (renamed George Bizos Interchange in 2021), built on an old farm and the point at which the N3 Eastern Bypass and the R24 Airport Freeway intersect, is the busiest interchange in the Southern Hemisphere. It is claimed that the N1 is the busiest road in South Africa.\nJohannesburg has a lot of freeways connected to it. The N1 connects northwards to Pretoria and Polokwane and southwards to Bloemfontein and Cape Town. The N3 connects south-east to Durban. The N12 connects westwards to Potchefstroom and Kimberley and eastwards to eMalahleni. The N14 passes at the north-western corner of the Johannesburg Municipality, connecting Pretoria with Krugersdorp. The N17 connects eastwards to Ermelo and Eswatini. The R21 connects the East Rand and O. R. Tambo International Airport with Pretoria. The R24 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the airport. The R59 connects southwards to Vereeniging and Sasolburg. The M1 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the northern suburbs and the southern suburbs. The M2 connects the Johannesburg CBD with the Germiston CBD to the east. The M1 and M2 freeways are congested due to mass urbanisation.\nJohannesburg also has a lot of non-freeway routes that connect to other towns and cities. The R24 connects the Johannesburg city centre with Roodepoort, Krugersdorp and Rustenburg to the west. The R25 connects Johannesburg's northern suburbs with Modderfontein and Kempton Park to the north-east. The R29 connects the city centre with Germiston, Boksburg and Benoni to the east. The R41 connects the city centre with Roodepoort and Randfontein to the west. The R55 connects Sandton with Pretoria West to the north. The R82 connects Johannesburg South with Vereeniging to the south. The R101 connects Sandton with Midrand, Centurion and Pretoria to the north. The R511 connects Sandton with Diepsloot and Hartbeespoort to the north. The R512 connects Randburg with Lanseria International Airport and Hartbeespoort to the north.\nBus and taxi transit.\nJohannesburg is served by a bus fleet operated by MetroBus, a corporate unit of the City of Johannesburg. It has a fleet consisting of approximately 550 single and double-decker buses, plying 84 different routes in the city. This total includes 200 modern buses (150 double-deckers and 50 single-deckers), made by Volvo, Scania AB and Marcopolo/Brasa in 2002. Metrobus' fleet carries approximately 20 million passengers per annum. In addition, there are a number of private bus operators, though most focus on the inter-city routes, or on bus charters for touring groups. The city's main bus terminus is situated in Gandhi Square, where passengers can also obtain information regarding the Metrobus service from the walk-in customer information desk.\nIn 2010, in order to create an efficient public transport system, the Rea Vaya bus rapid system was developed/built. The buses run on their own dedicated bus lanes on the main trunk and complementary routes. The buses also have large feeder routes that run on ordinary roads. The Rea Vaya works on a smartcard payment system. Upon entering the station or bus, the passenger taps his/her smartcard onto the validator/scanner and taps out at the next station with the calculated amount. The routes cover both the southern and northern suburbs with the main trunk route running from Soweto to Sandton and Rosebank, and the feeder and complementary routes covering most of Johannesburg, with the notable exceptions of Midrand and Centurion. A subsequent expansion (phase 1-C;1-D) will cover these areas. In 2017, the Rea Vaya bus rapid transit was recorded to be making huge losses recovering only about 40 per cent of the operating costs and relying heavily on government subsidies.\nJohannesburg has two kinds of taxis, metered taxis and minibus taxis. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city looking for passengers and instead must be called and ordered to a destination. The Gauteng Provincial Government has launched a new metered taxi programme in an attempt to increase the use of metered taxis in the city.\nThe minibus \"taxis\" are the \"de facto\" standard and essential form of transport for the majority of the population. Since the 1980s, the minibus taxi industry has been severely affected by turf wars.\nAirports.\nJohannesburg is served principally by O. R. Tambo International Airport (formerly Johannesburg International Airport and before that Jan Smuts Airport) for both domestic and international flights. Lanseria Airport, located to the north-west of the city and closer to the business hub of Sandton, is used for commercial flights to Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Botswana, and Sun City. Other airports include Rand Airport and Grand Central Airport. Rand Airport, located in Germiston, is a small airfield used mostly for private aircraft and the home of South African Airways' first Boeing 747\u2013200 ZS-SAN and also 747SP ZS-SPC and now serves as an aviation museum. Grand Central is located in Midrand and also caters to small, private aircraft.\nRail.\nThe Metrorail Gauteng commuter rail system connects central Johannesburg to Soweto, Pretoria, and most of the satellite towns along the Witwatersrand. The railways transport huge numbers of commuters every day. However, the Metrorail infrastructure was built in Johannesburg's infancy and covers only the older areas in the city's south. The northern areas, including the business districts of Sandton, Midrand, Randburg, and Rosebank, are served by the rapid rail link Gautrain.\nA part of the Gauteng Provincial Government's Blue IQ Project, Gautrain has made provision for a rapid rail link, running north to south, between Johannesburg and Pretoria, and west to east between Sandton and the OR Tambo International Airport. Construction of the Gautrain Rapid Rail started in October 2006 and was completed in June 2012. It consists of a number of underground stations, as well as above-ground stations. Stations on the north\u2013south line include Johannesburg's Park Station (underground), Rosebank (underground), Sandton (underground), Marlboro (above-ground and raised), Midrand, Pretoria Station and Hatfield. There is also a line from the O.R. Tambo International Airport (above-ground and raised) travelling to Sandton via Rhodesfield (raised) and Marlboro. A 200-kilometre expansion is underway and will consist of 3 new lines and 18 new stations, and is expected to cost R18 billion and one-lines (Soweto Mamalodi) could take 4 years to build, most of the new stations will be in Johannesburg.\nThe east\u2013west line from the airport to Sandton opened in June 2010 in time for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, while the north\u2013south line opened on 2 August 2011, except for Park Station, which opened in 2012.\nThe rail system was designed to alleviate traffic on the N1 freeway between Johannesburg and Pretoria, which records vehicle loads of up to 300,000 per week day. An extensive bus feeder system has also been implemented, which allows access to the main stations from the outer suburbs, but is limited to a five-kilometre radius, which neglects the rest of the suburbs. This is the first new major railway system that has been laid in South Africa since 1977.\nIn 2010, a high-speed rail link was proposed between Johannesburg and Durban. In 2020 the government announced plans for high-speed rail from Johannesburg to Soweto.\nFreight.\nCity Deep Terminal is the name of Africa's largest dry port and was officially opened by the South African Railways Services (SARS) in 1977. The container terminal is connected to the Port of Durban, Port of Ngqurha, Port of Cape Town, as well as Southern Africa by road and rail. At least forty percent of container export/imports run on the Natal Corridor (Natcor) which is directly linked by rail to City Deep.\nTelecommunication.\nJohannesburg has 4 major cellular telecommunications operators: Vodacom, MTN, Cell C, and Telkom Mobile. Vodacom's global headquarters is located in Midrand. It was formed in 1994, just after the South African elections of 1994.\nMedia.\nJohannesburg has a number of regional radio stations such as 94.7 Highveld Stereo, Radiokansel / Radio Pulpit, Kaya FM, Radio 2000, YFM, Metro FM, 5FM, Jacaranda FM, SAfm, Phalaphala FM, Radio 702 and UJFM.\nJohannesburg is also the headquarters of state-owned broadcaster South African Broadcasting Corporation and pay-broadcast network Multichoice which distributes M-Net and DStv a digital satellite service, while eTV also has a presence in the city. The city has two television towers, the Hillbrow Tower and the Sentech Tower.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nJohannesburg is twinned with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nPartner cities.\nJohannesburg is cooperating with:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58894", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58894", "title": "Phosphorylation", "text": "Chemical process of introducing a phosphate\nIn biochemistry, phosphorylation is described as the \"transfer of a phosphate group\" from a donor to an acceptor or the addition of a phosphate group to a molecule. A common phosphorylating agent (phosphate donor) is ATP and a common family of acceptor are alcohols:\nThis equation can be written in several ways that are nearly equivalent that describe the behaviors of various protonated states of ATP, ADP, and the phosphorylated product.\nAs is clear from the equation, a phosphate group per se is not transferred, but a phosphoryl group (PO3-). Phosphoryl is an electrophile.\nThis process and its inverse, dephosphorylation, are common in biology. Protein phosphorylation often activates (or deactivates) many enzymes.\nDuring respiration.\nPhosphorylation is essential to the processes of both anaerobic and aerobic respiration, which involve the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the \"high-energy\" exchange medium in the cell. During aerobic respiration, ATP is synthesized in the mitochondrion by addition of a third phosphate group to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in a process referred to as oxidative phosphorylation. ATP is also synthesized by substrate-level phosphorylation during glycolysis. ATP is synthesized at the expense of solar energy by photophosphorylation in the chloroplasts of plant cells.\nPhosphorylation of glucose.\nGlucose metabolism.\nPhosphorylation of sugars is often the first stage in their catabolism. Phosphorylation allows cells to accumulate sugars because the phosphate group prevents the molecules from diffusing back across their transporter. Phosphorylation of glucose is a key reaction in sugar metabolism. The chemical equation for the conversion of D-glucose to D-glucose-6-phosphate in the first step of glycolysis is given by:\nD-glucose + ATP \u2192 D-glucose 6-phosphate + ADP\n\u0394G\u00b0 = \u221216.7 kJ/mol (\u00b0 indicates measurement at standard condition)\nGlycolysis.\nGlycolysis is an essential process of glucose degrading into two molecules of pyruvate, through various steps, with the help of different enzymes. It occurs in ten steps and proves that phosphorylation is a much required and necessary step to attain the end products. Phosphorylation initiates the reaction in step 1 of the preparatory step (first half of glycolysis), and initiates step 6 of payoff phase (second phase of glycolysis).\nGlucose, by nature, is a small molecule with the ability to diffuse in and out of the cell. By phosphorylating glucose (adding a phosphoryl group in order to create a negatively charged phosphate group), glucose is converted to glucose-6-phosphate, which is trapped within the cell as the cell membrane is negatively charged. This reaction occurs due to the enzyme hexokinase, an enzyme that helps phosphorylate many six-membered ring structures. Phosphorylation takes place in step 3, where fructose-6-phosphate is converted to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by phosphofructokinase.\nWhile phosphorylation is performed by ATPs during preparatory steps, phosphorylation during payoff phase is maintained by inorganic phosphate. Each molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is phosphorylated to form 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction is catalyzed by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The cascade effect of phosphorylation eventually causes instability and allows enzymes to open the carbon bonds in glucose.\nPhosphorylation functions is an extremely vital component of glycolysis, as it helps in transport, control, and efficiency.\nGlycogen synthesis.\nGlycogen is a long-term store of glucose produced by the cells of the liver. In the liver, the synthesis of glycogen is directly correlated with blood glucose concentration. High blood glucose concentration causes an increase in intracellular levels of glucose 6-phosphate in the liver, skeletal muscle, and fat (adipose) tissue. Glucose 6-phosphate has role in regulating glycogen synthase.\nHigh blood glucose releases insulin, stimulating the translocation of specific glucose transporters to the cell membrane; glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate during transport across the membrane by ATP-D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase and non-specific hexokinase (ATP-D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase). Liver cells are freely permeable to glucose, and the initial rate of phosphorylation of glucose is the rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism by the liver.\nThe liver's crucial role in controlling blood sugar concentrations by breaking down glucose into carbon dioxide and glycogen is characterized by the negative Gibbs free energy (\u0394G) value, which indicates that this is a point of regulation with. The hexokinase enzyme has a low Michaelis constant (Km), indicating a high affinity for glucose, so this initial phosphorylation can proceed even when glucose levels at nanoscopic scale within the blood.\nThe phosphorylation of glucose can be enhanced by the binding of fructose 6-phosphate (F6P), and lessened by the binding fructose 1-phosphate (F1P). Fructose consumed in the diet is converted to F1P in the liver. This negates the action of F6P on glucokinase, which ultimately favors the forward reaction. The capacity of liver cells to phosphorylate fructose exceeds capacity to metabolize fructose-1-phosphate. Consuming excess fructose ultimately results in an imbalance in liver metabolism, which indirectly exhausts the liver cell's supply of ATP.\nAllosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphate, which acts as an effector, stimulates glycogen synthase, and glucose-6-phosphate may inhibit the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by cyclic AMP-stimulated protein kinase.\nOther processes.\nPhosphorylation of glucose is imperative in processes within the body. For example, phosphorylating glucose is necessary for insulin-dependent mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway activity within the heart. This further suggests a link between intermediary metabolism and cardiac growth.\nProtein phosphorylation.\nProtein phosphorylation is the most abundant post-translational modification in eukaryotes. The most common phospho-amino acids are Serine, Threonine, and Tyrosine at a ratio of 1800:200:1. Phosphorylation on serine, threonine and tyrosine side chains occurs through phosphoester bond formation, on histidine, lysine and arginine through phosphoramidate bonds, and on aspartic acid and glutamic acid through mixed anhydride linkages.\nProtein phosphorylation is common on human non-canonical amino acids, including motifs containing phosphorylated histidine, aspartate, glutamate, cysteine, arginine and lysine in HeLa cell extracts. Recent evidence confirms widespread histidine phosphorylation at both the 1 and 3 N-atoms of the imidazole ring. Phospho-tyrosine is much more stable than phospho-Serine and -Threonine which are in turn more stable than other phospho-amino acids, hence the analysis of phosphorylated histidine (and other non-canonical amino acids) using standard biochemical and mass spectrometric approaches is much more challenging and special procedures and separation techniques are required for their preservation alongside classical Ser, Thr and Tyr phosphorylation.\nThe prominent role of protein phosphorylation in biochemistry is illustrated by the huge body of studies published on the subject (as of March 2015, the MEDLINE database returns over 240,000 articles, mostly on \"protein\" phosphorylation).\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58895", "revid": "50905145", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58895", "title": "Music of Latin America", "text": "Collective term for the dances, rhythms and styles of music from Latin America\nThe music of Latin America refers to music originating from Latin America, namely the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of the Americas south of the United States. Latin American music also incorporates its African influences into the music of Latin America, while maintaining the identity of indigenous music of Latin America. Due to its highly syncretic nature, Latin American music encompasses a wide variety of styles, including influential genres such as cumbia, bachata, bossa nova, merengue, rumba, salsa, samba, son, candombe and tango. During the 20th century, many styles were influenced by the music of the United States giving rise to genres such as Latin pop, rock, jazz, hip hop, and reggaeton.\nGeographically, it usually refers to the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions of Latin America, but sometimes includes Francophone countries and territories of the Caribbean and South America as well. It also encompasses Latin American styles that have originated in the United States such as, New Mexico music, Tejano, various forms of country-Western, as well as Chicano rock, Nuyorican rap, and Chicano rap. The origins of Latin American music can be traced back to West Africa, Central Africa, Indigenous, and the Spanish and Portuguese conquest of the Americas in the 16th century, when the European settlers brought their music from overseas. Latin American music is performed in Spanish and Portuguese.\nPopular music styles by country and territory.\nArgentina.\nWhile the exact origins of tango remain uncertain, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges believed the genre to have originated in the brothels of 19th century Buenos Aires or Montevideo. Editors of \"World Music: The Rough Guide\" (2000) called Borges' statement \"a little presumptive\" and pinpoint the early developments of tango to the bars frequented by \"porte\u00f1os.\" Emerging from a melting pot of European immigrants, \"criollos\", blacks, and indigenous peoples, the genre is believed to have been influenced by Andalusian flamenco, Spanish contradanse, Italian folk music, Cuban habanera, African candombe and percussion, German polkas, Polish mazurkas, and Argentine milonga. In its early history, tango music was associated with brawls at brothels and knife-wielding womanizing men, known locally as \"malevos\" or \"compadritos\". By 1914, men outnumbered women in Argentina by 100,000, leading to an increased rate of prostitution and the brothel lifestyle that came with it. Men would often dance at cafes and bars and try to outdo one another with improvised dance steps in an attempt to attract a woman.\nTheir dances were characterized by \"showy yet threatening, predatory quality, often revolving around a possessive relationship between two men and one woman\". In its original form, tango music included the violin, guitar, and flute. By the late 19th century, the bandoneon had been introduced into the genre. The instrument, first developed in Germany for playing folk and religious music in churches that lacked organs, is believed to have been brought to the region by immigrants and sailors. One of its early pioneers, Eduardo Arolas, was nicknamed the \"Tiger of the \"Bandone\u00f3n\"\". Arolas believed the instrument was made to play in tango. Vicente Greco is credited with standardizing tango with his group, Orquesta T\u00edpica Criolla, by using two violins and two bandoneons. The instrumentation of tango remained largely unchanged until the 1940s. Tango music began playing in populated areas such as fairgrounds and streets in Buenos Aires. It contained lyrics that were \"sometimes obscene and deeply fatalistic\". Similar to families in the United States during the rise of rock and roll, families in the area tried to shield their children from tango. Upper-classmen began taking an interest in tango: writer Ricardo G\u00fciraldes performed tango during a tour of Europe in 1910 and has been credited with introducing tango in Europe. G\u00fciraldes' introduction made tango the first Latin dance to gain popularity in Europe. Actor Rudolph Valentino performed the tango in his film \"The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse\" (1926), with Hollywood taking advantage of \"[Valentino's] charisma, the magnetism of tango, and the attraction they both had on a huge public\".\nOther styles of music in Argentina include the chacarera, milonga, zamba and chamam\u00e9. Modern rhythms include cuarteto (music from the Cordoba Province) and electrotango. Argentine rock (known locally as \"rock nacional\") was most popular during the 1980s, and remains one of Argentina's most popular music genres. \"Rock en espa\u00f1ol\" was first popular in Argentina, then swept through other Hispanic American countries and Spain. The movement was known as the \"Argentine Wave\".\nBolivia.\nBolivian music is perhaps the most strongly linked to its native population among the national styles of South America. After the nationalistic period of the 1950s Aymara and Quechuan culture became more widely accepted, and their folk music evolved into a more pop-like sound. Los Kjarkas played a pivotal role in this fusion. Other forms of native music (such as huay\u00f1os and caporales) are also widely played. Cumbia is another popular genre. There are also lesser-known regional forms, such as the music from Santa Cruz and Tarija (where styles such as Cueca and Chacarera are popular).\nBrazil.\nBrazil is a large, diverse country with a long history of popular-musical development, ranging from the early-20th-century innovation of samba to the modern \"M\u00fasica popular brasileira\". Bossa nova is internationally well-known, and Forr\u00f3 (pronounced ) is also widely known and popular in Brazil. Lambada is influenced by rhythms like cumbia and merengue. Funk carioca (also known as Brazilian funk) is also a highly popular style, including tamborz\u00e3o rhythms.\nChile.\nMany musical genres are native to Chile; one of the most popular was the Chilean Romantic Cumbia, exemplified by artists such as Americo and Leo Rey. The Nueva Canci\u00f3n originated in the 1960s and 1970s and spread in popularity until the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat, when most musicians were arrested, killed or exiled.\nIn Central Chile, several styles can be found: the Cueca (the national dance), the \"Tonada\", the \"Refalosa\", the \"Sajuriana\", the Zapateado, the \"Cuando\" and the Vals. In the Norte Grande region traditional music resembles the music of southern Per\u00fa and western Bolivia, and is known as Andean music. This music, which reflects the spirit of the indigenous people of the Altiplano, was an inspiration for the Nueva canci\u00f3n. \nThe Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago has unique folk-music styles, due to its isolation from the culture centres of Santiago.\nMusic from Chilean Polynesia, Rapa Nui music, is derived from Polynesian culture rather than colonial society or European influences.\nCosta Rica.\nThe music of Costa Rica is represented by musical expressions as parrandera, the Tambito, waltz, bolero, gang, calypso, chiquichiqui, mento the run and callera. They emerged from the migration processes and historical exchanges between indigenous, European and African. Typical instruments are the quijongo, marimba, ocarinas, low drawer, the Sabak, reed flutes, accordion, mandolin and guitar.\nCuba.\nCuba has produced many musical genres, and a number of musicians in a variety of styles. Blended styles range from the danz\u00f3n to the rumba.\nColombia.\nColombian music can be divided into four musical zones: the Atlantic coast, the Pacific coast, the Andean region and Los Llanos.\nThe Atlantic music features rhythms such as the cumbia, porros and mapal\u00e9. Music from the Pacific coast such features rhythms such as the \"currulao\" \u2014which is tinged with Spanish influence\u2014 and the Jota chocoana (along with many more afro-drum predominating music forms)\u2014tinged with African and Aboriginal influence. Colombian Andean has been strongly influenced by Spanish rhythms and instruments, and differs noticeably from the indigenous music of Peru or Bolivia. Typical forms include the \"bambuco\", \"pasillo guabina\" and \"torbellino\", played with pianos and string instruments such as the \"tiple guitarra\". The music of Los Llanos, \"m\u00fasica llanera\", is usually accompanied by a harp, a \"cuatro\" (a type of four-string guitar) and maracas. It has much in common with the music of the Venezuelan Llanos.\nApart from these traditional forms, two newer musical styles have conquered large parts of the country: \"la salsa\", which has spread throughout the Pacific coast and the \"vallenato\", which originated in La Guajira and C\u00e9sar (on the northern Caribbean coast). The latter is based on European accordion music. Merengue music is heard as well. More recently, musical styles such as reggaeton and bachata have also become popular.\nDominican Republic.\nMerengue t\u00edpico and Orchestra merengue have been popular in the Dominican Republic for many decades, and is widely regarded as the national music. Bachata is more recent arrival, arriving in the first half of the 20th century, taking influences from the \"bolero\" and derived from the country's rural guitar music. Bachata has evolved and risen in popularity over the last 40 years in the Dominican Republic and other areas (such as Puerto Rico) with the help of artists such as Antony Santos, Luis Segura, Luis Vargas, Teodoro Reyes, Yoskar Sarante, Alex Bueno, and Aventura. Bachata, merengue and salsa are now equally popular among Spanish-speaking Caribbean people. When the Spanish \"conquistadors\" sailed across the Atlantic they brought with them a type of music known as \"hesparo\", which contributed to the development of Dominican music. A romantic style is also popular in the Dominican Republic from vocalists such as Angela Carrasco, Anthony Rios, Maridalia Hernandez and Olga Lara. Reggaeton is currently one of the most popular genres coming out of the Dominican Republic. It has been recently popularized in night clubs with these high beats. This was made by the help of Dominican artist El Alfa. El Alfa has made \"dembow\" one of the most popular types of reggaeton. He has been able to produce highly played songs that are played in multiple countries.\nEcuador.\nTraditional Ecuadorian music can be classified as mestizo, Indian and Afro-Ecuadorian music. Mestizo music evolved from the interrelation between Spanish and Indian music. It has rhythms such as \"pasacalles\", \"pasillos\", \"albazos\" and \"sanjuanitos\", and is usually played by stringed instruments. There are also regional variations: coastal styles, such as \"vals\" (similar to Vals Peruano (Waltz)) and \"montubio\" music (from the coastal hill country).\nIndian music in Ecuador is determined in varying degrees by the influence of \"quichua\" culture. Within it are \"sanjuanitos\" (different from the \"mestizo sanjuanito\"), \"capishkas\", \"danzantes\" and \"yaravis\". Non-\"quichua\" indigenous music ranges from the Ts\u00e1chila music of Santo Domingo (influenced by the neighboring Afro-marimba) to the Amazonian music of groups such as the Shuar.\nBlack Ecuadorian music can be classified into two main forms. The first type is black music from the coastal Esmeraldas province, and is characterized by the marimba. The second variety is black music from the Chota Valley in the northern Sierra (primarily known as Bomba del Chota), characterized by a more-pronounced mestizo and Indian influence than \"marimba esmeralde\u00f1a\". Most of these musical styles are also played by wind ensembles of varying sizes at popular festivals around the country. Like other Latin American countries, Ecuadorian music includes local exponents of international styles: from opera, salsa and rock to cumbia, thrash metal and jazz.\nEl Salvador.\nSalvadoran music may be compared with the Colombian style of music known as \"cumbia\".\nPopular styles in modern El Salvador (in addition to \"cumbia\") are salsa, Bachata and Reggaeton. \"Political chaos tore the country apart in the early 20th century, and music was often suppressed, especially those with strong native influences. In the 1940s, for example, it was decreed that a dance called \"Xuc\" was to be the \"national dance\" which was created and led by Paquito Palaviccini's and his \"Orquestra Internacional Polio\"\". In recent years reggaeton and hip hop have gained popularity, led by groups such as Pescozada and Mecate. Salvadorian music has a musical style influenced by Mayan music (played on the El Salvador-Guatemala border, in Chalatenango). Another popular style of music not native to El Salvador is known as Punta a Honduran style.\nSome of the leading classical composers from El Salvador include Alex Panam\u00e1, Carlos Col\u00f3n-Quintana, and German C\u00e1ceres.\nGuatemala.\nGuatemala has a very extensive musical history, from Mayan music to modern-day acts such as Ricardo Arjona. They have a diverse range of music. Popular music in Guatemala usually consists of Marimba music. Which incorporates the Marimba keyboard percussion instrument of Central African origins, when it was first brought originally by enslaved Africans to Central America and the Caribbean.\nHonduras.\nThe music of Honduras varies from Punta and Paranda (Traditional music from Honduras) to Caribbean and Central American music such as salsa, merengue, reggae, reggaeton, Dancehall. The country's old capital of Comayagua is an important center for modern Honduran music, and is home to the College for Fine Arts.\nMexico.\n \nMexico is perhaps one of the most musically diverse countries in the world. Each of its 31 states, its capital city and each of Mexico City's boroughs claim unique styles of music. The most representative genre is mariachi music or traditional regional music corridos. Although commonly misportrayed as buskers, mariachis musicians play extremely technical, structured music or blends such as jarabe. Most mariachi music is sung in verses of prose poetry. Ranchera, Mexico's country music, differs from mariachi in that it is less technical and its lyrics are not sung in prose. Other regional music includes: \"son jarocho\", \"son huasteco\", \"cumbia sonidera\", Mexican pop, \"rock en espa\u00f1ol\", Mexican rock and \"canto nuevo\". There is also music based on sounds made by dancing (such as the \"zapateada\").\nNortheastern Mexico is home to another popular style called \"norte\u00f1a\", which assimilates Mexican \"ranchera\" with Colombian \"cumbia\" and is typically played with Bavarian accordions and Bohemian polka influence. One of the most popular music styles in all Mexico are \"corridos\". This is regional mexican music and recently been popularized by famous artist such as Peso Pluma and Grupo Frontera. These folk tales consist of money and love. Poetry backed up instrumentals of the guitar and trumpet. It has grown to be very popular in the United States. Variations of \"norte\u00f1a\" include \"duranguense\", \"tambora sinaloense\", \"corridos\" and nortec (norte\u00f1o-techno). The eastern part of the country makes heavy use of the harp, typical of the \"son arocho\" style. The music in southern Mexico is particularly represented by its use of the marimba, which has its origins in the Soconusco region between Mexico and Guatemala.\nThe north-central states have recently spawned a Tecktonik-style music, combining electro and other dance genres with more traditional music. Salsa (music) has also played an important role in Mexican music shown by Sonora Santanera. Currently, Reggaeton is very popular in modern Mexico.\nNicaragua.\nThe most popular style of music in Nicaragua is \"palo de Mayo\", which is both a type of dance music and a festival where the dance (and music) originated. Other popular music includes marimba, folklore, \"son nica\", folk music, \"merengue\", \"bachata\" and salsa.\nPanama.\nThe music of Panama is the result of the mestizaje, It has occurred during the last five hundred years between the Iberian traditions, especially those of Andalusia, American Indians and those of West Africa. Mestizaje that has been enriched by cultural exchange caused by several waves of migrations originating in Europe, in various parts of the Caribbean (mostly Barbados, Trinidad, Jamaica and Saint Lucia) in Asia and several points in South and North America. These migrations were due to the Spanish colonization of America, which was forced to use the Royal Route of Panama as an inter-oceanic trade route, which included the slave trade (an institution abolished in Panama in 1851); To the traffic, product of the exploitation of the silver mines in the Viceroyalty of Peru during centuries XVI and XVII; To the legendary riches of the Fair of Portobelo, between centuries XVII and XVIII; To the construction of the Trans\u00edsmico Railroad, begun in 1850, and the Interoceanic Canal, initiated by France in 1879, concluded by the United States in 1914 and expanded by Panama from 2007.\nWith this rich cultural heritage, Panama has contributed significantly to the development of Cumbia, Decima, Panamanian saloma, Pasillo, Panamanian bunde, bullerengue, Punto Music, Tamborito, Mejorana, Panamanian Murga, Tamborera (Examples: Guarare and Tambor de la Alegria), bolero, jazz, Salsa, reggae and calypso, through composers like Nicolas Aceves N\u00fa\u00f1ez (hall, cumbia, tamborito, Pasillo), Luis Russell (jazz), Ricardo F\u00e1brega (bolero and Tamborera), Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez V\u00e9lez (cumbia and bolero), Arturo \"Chino\" Hassan (bolero), Nando Boom (reggae), Lord Cobra (calypso), Rub\u00e9n Blades (salsa), Danilo P\u00e9rez (jazz), Vicente G\u00f3mez Gudi\u00f1o (Pasillo), C\u00e9sar Alcedo, among many others.\nParaguay.\nParaguayan music depends largely upon two instruments: the guitar and the harp, which were brought by the conquistadors and found their own voices in the country. Polka Paraguaya, which adopted its name from the European dance, is the most popular type of music and has different versions (including the \"galopa\", the \"krye\u2019\u00ff\" and the \"canci\u00f3n Paraguaya\", or \"Paraguayan song\"). The first two are faster and more upbeat than a standard polka; the third is a bit slower and slightly melancholy. Other popular styles include the \"purah\u00e9i jahe\u2019o\" and the \"compuesto\" (which tell sad, epic or love stories). The polka is usually based on poetic lyrics, but there are some emblematic pieces of Paraguayan music (such as \"P\u00e1jaro Campana\", or \"Songbird\", by F\u00e9lix P\u00e9rez Cardozo).\nGuarania is the second-best-known Paraguayan musical style, and was created by musician Jos\u00e9 Asunci\u00f3n Flores in 1925.\nPeru.\nPeruvian music is made up of indigenous, Spanish and West African influences. Coastal Afro-Peruvian music is characterized by the use of the \"caj\u00f3n peruano\". Amerindian music varies according to region and ethnicity. The best-known Amerindian style is the \"huayno\" (also popular in Bolivia), played on instruments such as the charango and guitar. Mestizo music is varied and includes popular \"valses\" and \"marinera\" from the northern coast.\nPuerto Rico.\nThe history of music on the island of Puerto Rico begins with its original inhabitants, the Ta\u00ednos. The Ta\u00edno Indians have influenced the Puerto Rican culture greatly, leaving behind important contributions such as their musical instruments, language, food, plant medicine and art. The heart of much Puerto Rican music is the idea of improvisation in both the music and the lyrics. A performance takes on an added dimension when the audience can anticipate the response of one performer to a difficult passage of music or clever lyrics created by another. When two singers, either both men or a man and a woman, engage in vocal competition in m\u00fasica j\u00edbara this is a special type of seis called a \"controversia\". Of all Puerto Rico's musical exports, the best-known is reggaeton. \"Bomba\" and \"plena\" have long been popular, while reggaet\u00f3n is a relatively recent invention. \nIt is a form of urban contemporary music, often combining other Latin musical styles, Caribbean and West Indies music, (such as reggae, \"soca\", Spanish reggae, salsa, merengue and \"bachata\". It originates from Panamanian Reggae en Espa\u00f1ol and Jamaican dancehall, however received its rise to popularity through Puerto Rico.\"Tropikeo\" is the fusion of R&amp;B, Rap, Hip Hop, Funk and Techno Music within a Tropical musical frame of salsa, in which the conga drums and/or timbales drums are the main source of rhythm of the tune, in conjunction with a heavy salsa \"montuno\" of the piano. The lyrics of the song can be rapped or sung, or used combining both styles, as well as danced in both styles. \"Aguinaldo\" from Puerto Rico is similar to Christmas carols, except that they are usually sung in a parranda, which is rather like a lively parade that moves from house to house in a neighborhood, looking for holiday food and drink. The melodies were subsequently used for the improvisational d\u00e9cima and seis. There are aguinaldos that are usually sung in churches or religious services, while there are aguinaldos that are more popular and are sung in the parrandas. Danza is a very sophisticated form of music that can be extremely varied in its expression; they can be either romantic or festive. Romantic danzas have four sections, beginning with an eight measure paseo followed by three themes of sixteen measures each. The third theme typically includes a solo by the bombardino and, often, a return to the first theme or a coda at the end. Festive danzas are free-form, with the only rules being an introduction and a swift rhythm. Plena is a narrative song from the coastal regions of Puerto Rico, especially around Ponce, Puerto Rico. Its origins have been various claimed as far back as 1875 and as late as 1920. As rural farmers moved to San Juan, Puerto Rico and other cities, they brought plena with them and eventually added horns and improvised call and response vocals. Lyrics generally deal with stories or current events, though some are light-hearted or humorous.\nUruguay.\nUruguayan music has similar roots to that of Argentina. Uruguayan tango and \"milonga\" are both popular styles, and folk music from along the River Plate is indistinguishable from its Argentine counterpart. Uruguay rock and \"cancion popular\" (Uruguayan versions of rock and pop music) are popular local forms. \"Candombe\", a style of drumming descended from African slaves in the area, is quintessentially Uruguayan (although it is played to a lesser extent in Argentina). It is most popular in Montevideo, but may also be heard in a number of other cities. 21st. Century Uruguayan music is also heard internationally as part of the language of Uruguayan composers such as three-time Grammy nominated Miguel del Aguila\nVenezuela.\n\"The Joropo\" is Venezuelan popular music originating in the \"llanos\" plains, although a more upbeat and festive \"gaita\" version is heard western Venezuela (particularly in Zulia State). There are also African-influenced styles which emphasize drumming including multiple rhythms, such as sangueo, fulia, parranda, tamborera and calypso from the Guayana region (influenced by neighboring English-speaking countries). The Aguinaldo, conforms the national representation of the Venezuelan Christmas. In the east, the malague\u00f1a, punto and galer\u00f3n accompanies the velorios de cruz de mayo, (religious tradition, that is celebrated on 3 May in honor to the Christian cross). In the Venezuelan Andes, the Venezuelan bambuco is a local variation of the bambuco. Other forms include the polo and the Venezuelan waltz. El merengue venezolano es una m\u00fasica bailable del siglo XX de Venezuela, con un caracter\u00edstico ritmo atractivo. Es un g\u00e9nero completamente diferente del merengue de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana en cuanto a su ritmo, instrumentos, cultura e historia.\nVenezuelan Merengue is also known by two other names: merengue caraque\u00f1o, relating its origin to the capital Caracas, and merengue rucaneao, in which reference to R\u00facano, a mixture for a popular jelly dessert, is used as a simile for the sensual pelvic movements of its dance. Merengue came into vogue in Venezuela during the period from the 1920s to the 1940s. At first, merengue music was associated with the mabiles, popular drinking and dancing spots in Caracas, and with the capital's carnival celebrations in street parades and plazas. Later in the 1940s, it was absorbed into the dance halls of the upper classes, and also formed part of the repertoire of smaller groups such as the Cantores del Tr\u00f3pico, led by guitarist Antonio Lauro (who composed 'Merengue para guitarra') and composers such as Eduardo Serrano. The hybrid traditional ensembles of then and now that dedicate their program to folkloric program to arrangements of Venezuelan folk music - ensembles such as estudiantinas, Venezuelan Merengue. Nowadays it is always discussed whether merengue is written in 2/4, 6/8 or 5/8.\nPopular styles.\nSalsa.\nBased on Cuban music in rhythm, tempo, bass line, riffs and instrumentation, Salsa represents an amalgamation of musical styles including rock, jazz, and other Latin American musical traditions. Modern salsa (as it became known worldwide) was forged in the pan-Latin melting pot of New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.\nLatin trap.\nLatin trap has become famous around 2015. It has influences of American trap and reggaeton music.\nReggaet\u00f3n.\nReggaeton (also known as reggaet\u00f3n and reguet\u00f3n[1]) is a musical genre which originated in Puerto Rico during the 1990s as a result of the mixing Spanish Reggae and Spanish Hip-hop, which both stemmed from different countries. Spanish Reggae was a product of musical movements in Jamaica and Panama, while Spanish Hip-Hop was created by the influence of Hip-Hop in the U.S. at the time. Reggaeton was developed in areas of Public housing in Puerto Rico, known as \"caserios,\" which were filled with urban poverty and criminal activity such as drug violence. Popular Reggaeton artists, such as Daddy Yankee, grew up in these \"caserios,\" where their lyrics reflected life in the public housing developments and, in addition, experiences of racial exclusion in the country. These lyrics included themes surrounding sex and life in the streets, influenced by the environment in which it was developed.\nReggaeton is commonly created over a \"boom-ch-boom-chick\" beat known as \"dembow.\" This beat originates from Jamaican dancehall and reggae music and was first used for a song titled \"Dembow\" by Jamaican musician Shabba Ranks. This beat was produced by Bobby \"Digital\" Dixon and has been used in the genre since the early 1990s. Since then, songs of the genre, in addition to Reggae and Hip-Hop, have incorporated beats from other latin genres such as Salsa, Bachata, Cumbia, and Merengue.\nLatin ballad.\nThe Latin (or romantic) ballad is a Latin musical genre which originated in the 1960s. This ballad is very popular in Hispanic America and Spain, and is characterized by a sensitive rhythm. A descendant of the \"bolero\", it has several variants (such as salsa and \"cumbia\"). Since the mid-20th century a number of artists have popularized the genre, such as Julio Iglesias, Luis Miguel, Enrique Iglesias, Alejandra \u00c1valos, Cristian Castro, Franco de Vita and Jos\u00e9 Jos\u00e9.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The direct sum of modules is the smallest module which contains the given modules as submodules with no \"unnecessary\" constraints, making it an example of a coproduct. Contrast with the direct product, which is the dual notion.\nThe most familiar examples of this construction occur when considering vector spaces (modules over a field) and abelian groups (modules over the ring Z of integers). The construction may also be extended to cover Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.\nSee the article decomposition of a module for a way to write a module as a direct sum of submodules.\nConstruction for vector spaces and abelian groups.\nWe give the construction first in these two cases, under the assumption that we have only two objects. Then we generalize to an arbitrary family of arbitrary modules. The key elements of the general construction are more clearly identified by considering these two cases in depth.\nConstruction for two vector spaces.\nSuppose \"V\" and \"W\" are vector spaces over the field \"K\". The Cartesian product \"V\" \u00d7 \"W\" can be given the structure of a vector space over \"K\" by defining the operations componentwise:\nfor \"v\", \"v\"1, \"v\"2 \u2208 \"V\", \"w\", \"w\"1, \"w\"2 \u2208 \"W\", and \"\u03b1\" \u2208 \"K\".\nThe resulting vector space is called the \"direct sum\" of \"V\" and \"W\" and is usually denoted by a plus symbol inside a circle:\nformula_1\nIt is customary to write the elements of an ordered sum not as ordered pairs (\"v\", \"w\"), but as a sum \"v\" + \"w\".\nThe subspace \"V\" \u00d7 {0} of \"V\" \u2295 \"W\" is isomorphic to \"V\" and is often identified with \"V\"; similarly for {0} \u00d7 \"W\" and \"W\". (See \"internal direct sum\" below.) With this identification, every element of \"V\" \u2295 \"W\" can be written in one and only one way as the sum of an element of \"V\" and an element of \"W\". The dimension of \"V\" \u2295 \"W\" is equal to the sum of the dimensions of \"V\" and \"W\". One elementary use is the reconstruction of a finite vector space from any subspace \"W\" and its orthogonal complement: \nformula_2\nThis construction readily generalizes to any finite number of vector spaces.\nConstruction for two abelian groups.\nFor abelian groups \"G\" and \"H\" which are written additively, the direct product of \"G\" and \"H\" is also called a direct sum . Thus the Cartesian product \"G\" \u00d7 \"H\" is equipped with the structure of an abelian group by defining the operations componentwise:\n (\"g\"1, \"h\"1) + (\"g\"2, \"h\"2) = (\"g\"1 + \"g\"2, \"h\"1 + \"h\"2)\nfor \"g\"1, \"g\"2 in \"G\", and \"h\"1, \"h\"2 in \"H\".\nIntegral multiples are similarly defined componentwise by\n \"n\"(\"g\", \"h\") = (\"ng\", \"nh\")\nfor \"g\" in \"G\", \"h\" in \"H\", and \"n\" an integer. This parallels the extension of the scalar product of vector spaces to the direct sum above.\nThe resulting abelian group is called the \"direct sum\" of \"G\" and \"H\" and is usually denoted by a plus symbol inside a circle:\nformula_3\nIt is customary to write the elements of an ordered sum not as ordered pairs (\"g\", \"h\"), but as a sum \"g\" + \"h\".\nThe subgroup \"G\" \u00d7 {0} of \"G\" \u2295 \"H\" is isomorphic to \"G\" and is often identified with \"G\"; similarly for {0} \u00d7 \"H\" and \"H\". (See \"internal direct sum\" below.) With this identification, it is true that every element of \"G\" \u2295 \"H\" can be written in one and only one way as the sum of an element of \"G\" and an element of \"H\". The rank of \"G\" \u2295 \"H\" is equal to the sum of the ranks of \"G\" and \"H\".\nThis construction readily generalises to any finite number of abelian groups.\nConstruction for an arbitrary family of modules.\nOne should notice a clear similarity between the definitions of the direct sum of two vector spaces and of two abelian groups. In fact, each is a special case of the construction of the direct sum of two modules. Additionally, by modifying the definition one can accommodate the direct sum of an infinite family of modules. The precise definition is as follows .\nLet \"R\" be a ring, and {\"M\"\"i\"\u00a0:\u00a0\"i\"\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"I\"} a family of left \"R\"-modules indexed by the set \"I\". The \"direct sum\" of {\"M\"\"i\"} is then defined to be the set of all sequences formula_4 where formula_5 and formula_6 for cofinitely many indices \"i\". (The direct product is analogous but the indices do not need to cofinitely vanish.)\nIt can also be defined as functions \u03b1 from \"I\" to the disjoint union of the modules \"M\"\"i\" such that \u03b1(\"i\")\u00a0\u2208\u00a0\"M\"\"i\" for all \"i\" \u2208 \"I\" and \u03b1(\"i\") = 0 for cofinitely many indices \"i\". These functions can equivalently be regarded as finitely supported sections of the fiber bundle over the index set \"I\", with the fiber over formula_7 being formula_8.\nThis set inherits the module structure via component-wise addition and scalar multiplication. Explicitly, two such sequences (or functions) \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be added by writing formula_9 for all \"i\" (note that this is again zero for all but finitely many indices), and such a function can be multiplied with an element \"r\" from \"R\" by defining formula_10 for all \"i\". In this way, the direct sum becomes a left \"R\"-module, and it is denoted\nformula_11\nIt is customary to write the sequence formula_4 as a sum formula_13. Sometimes a primed summation formula_14 is used to indicate that cofinitely many of the terms are zero.\nInternal direct sum.\nSuppose \"M\" is an \"R\"-module and \"M\"\"i\" is a submodule of \"M\" for each \"i\" in \"I\". If every \"x\" in \"M\" can be written in exactly one way as a sum of finitely many elements of the \"M\"\"i\", then we say that \"M\" is the internal direct sum of the submodules \"M\"\"i\" . In this case, \"M\" is naturally isomorphic to the (external) direct sum of the \"M\"\"i\" as defined above .\nA submodule \"N\" of \"M\" is a direct summand of \"M\" if there exists some other submodule \"N\u2032\" of \"M\" such that \"M\" is the \"internal\" direct sum of \"N\" and \"N\u2032\". In this case, \"N\" and \"N\u2032\" are called complementary submodules.\nUniversal property.\nIn the language of category theory, the direct sum is a coproduct and hence a colimit in the category of left \"R\"-modules, which means that it is characterized by the following universal property. For every \"i\" in \"I\", consider the \"natural embedding\"\nformula_21\nwhich sends the elements of \"M\"\"i\" to those functions which are zero for all arguments but \"i\". Now let \"M\" be an arbitrary \"R\"-module and \"f\"\"i\" : \"M\"\"i\" \u2192 \"M\" be arbitrary \"R\"-linear maps for every \"i\", then there exists precisely one \"R\"-linear map\nformula_22\nsuch that \"f\" o \"ji\" = \"f\"\"i\" for all \"i\".\nGrothendieck group.\nThe direct sum gives a collection of objects the structure of a commutative monoid, in that the addition of objects is defined, but not subtraction. In fact, subtraction can be defined, and every commutative monoid can be extended to an abelian group. This extension is known as the Grothendieck group. The extension is done by defining equivalence classes of pairs of objects, which allows certain pairs to be treated as inverses. The construction, detailed in the article on the Grothendieck group, is \"universal\", in that it has the universal property of being unique, and homomorphic to any other embedding of a commutative monoid in an abelian group.\nDirect sum of modules with additional structure.\nIf the modules we are considering carry some additional structure (for example, a norm or an inner product), then the direct sum of the modules can often be made to carry this additional structure, as well. In this case, we obtain the coproduct in the appropriate category of all objects carrying the additional structure. Two prominent examples occur for Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces.\nIn some classical texts, the phrase \"direct sum of algebras over a field\" is also introduced for denoting the algebraic structure that is presently more commonly called a direct product of algebras; that is, the Cartesian product of the underlying sets with the componentwise operations. This construction, however, does not provide a coproduct in the category of algebras, but a direct product (\"see note below\" and the remark on direct sums of rings).\nDirect sum of algebras.\nA direct sum of algebras formula_23 and formula_24 is the direct sum as vector spaces, with product \nformula_25\nConsider these classical examples:\nformula_26 is ring isomorphic to split-complex numbers, also used in interval analysis.\nformula_27 is the algebra of tessarines introduced by James Cockle in 1848.\nformula_28 called the split-biquaternions, was introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in 1873.\nJoseph Wedderburn exploited the concept of a direct sum of algebras in his classification of hypercomplex numbers. See his \"Lectures on Matrices\" (1934), page 151.\nWedderburn makes clear the distinction between a direct sum and a direct product of algebras: For the direct sum the field of scalars acts jointly on both parts: formula_29 while for the direct product a scalar factor may be collected alternately with the parts, but not both:\nformula_30\nIan R. Porteous uses the three direct sums above, denoting them formula_31 as rings of scalars in his analysis of \"Clifford Algebras and the Classical Groups\" (1995).\nThe construction described above, as well as Wedderburn's use of the terms direct sum and direct product follow a different convention than the one in category theory. In categorical terms, Wedderburn's direct sum is a categorical product, whilst Wedderburn's direct product is a coproduct (or categorical sum), which (for commutative algebras) actually corresponds to the tensor product of algebras.\nDirect sum of Banach spaces.\nThe direct sum of two Banach spaces formula_23 and formula_24 is the direct sum of formula_23 and formula_24 considered as vector spaces, with the norm formula_36 for all formula_37 and formula_38\nGenerally, if formula_39 is a collection of Banach spaces, where formula_40 traverses the index set formula_41 then the direct sum formula_42 is a module consisting of all functions formula_43 defined over formula_44 such that formula_45 for all formula_7 and\nformula_47\nThe norm is given by the sum above. The direct sum with this norm is again a Banach space.\nFor example, if we take the index set formula_48 and formula_49 then the direct sum formula_50 is the space formula_51 which consists of all the sequences formula_52 of reals with finite norm formula_53\nA closed subspace formula_54 of a Banach space formula_23 is complemented if there is another closed subspace formula_56 of formula_23 such that formula_23 is equal to the internal direct sum formula_59 Note that not every closed subspace is complemented; e.g. formula_60 is not complemented in formula_61\nDirect sum of modules with bilinear forms.\nLet formula_62 be a family indexed by formula_44 of modules equipped with bilinear forms. The orthogonal direct sum is the module direct sum with bilinear form formula_56 defined by\nformula_65\nin which the summation makes sense even for infinite index sets formula_44 because only finitely many of the terms are non-zero.\nDirect sum of Hilbert spaces.\nIf finitely many Hilbert spaces formula_67 are given, one can construct their orthogonal direct sum as above (since they are vector spaces), defining the inner product as:\nformula_68\nThe resulting direct sum is a Hilbert space which contains the given Hilbert spaces as mutually orthogonal subspaces.\nIf infinitely many Hilbert spaces formula_69 for formula_7 are given, we can carry out the same construction; notice that when defining the inner product, only finitely many summands will be non-zero. However, the result will only be an inner product space and it will not necessarily be complete. We then define the direct sum of the Hilbert spaces formula_69 to be the completion of this inner product space. \nAlternatively and equivalently, one can define the direct sum of the Hilbert spaces formula_69 as the space of all functions \u03b1 with domain formula_41 such that formula_74 is an element of formula_69 for every formula_7 and:\nformula_77\nThe inner product of two such function \u03b1 and \u03b2 is then defined as:\nformula_78\nThis space is complete and we get a Hilbert space.\nFor example, if we take the index set formula_48 and formula_49 then the direct sum formula_81 is the space formula_82 which consists of all the sequences formula_52 of reals with finite norm formula_84 Comparing this with the example for Banach spaces, we see that the Banach space direct sum and the Hilbert space direct sum are not necessarily the same. But if there are only finitely many summands, then the Banach space direct sum is isomorphic to the Hilbert space direct sum, although the norm will be different.\nEvery Hilbert space is isomorphic to a direct sum of sufficiently many copies of the base field, which is either formula_85 This is equivalent to the assertion that every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis. More generally, every closed subspace of a Hilbert space is complemented because it admits an orthogonal complement. Conversely, the Lindenstrauss\u2013Tzafriri theorem asserts that if every closed subspace of a Banach space is complemented, then the Banach space is isomorphic (topologically) to a Hilbert space.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

UAVs were originally developed through the twentieth century for military missions too \"dull, dirty or dangerous\" for humans, and by the twenty-first, they had become essential assets to most militaries. As control technologies improved and costs fell, their use expanded to many non-military applications. These include aerial photography, area coverage, precision agriculture, forest fire monitoring, river monitoring, environmental monitoring, weather observation, policing and surveillance, infrastructure inspections, smuggling, product deliveries, entertainment and drone racing.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nMany terms are used for aircraft which fly without any persons on board.\nIn common usage, \"drone\" is often applied to both military and civilian UAVs, while technical and regulatory documents may prefer terms such as UAV, UAS, RPAS, or uncrewed aircraft.The term drone has been used from the early days of aviation, some being applied to remotely flown target aircraft used for practice firing of a battleship's guns, such as the 1920s Fairey Queen and 1930s de Havilland Queen Bee. Later examples included the Airspeed Queen Wasp and Miles Queen Martinet, before ultimate replacement by the GAF Jindivik. The term remains in common use. In addition to the software, autonomous drones also employ a host of advanced technologies that allow them to carry out their missions without human intervention, such as cloud computing, computer vision, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and thermal sensors. For recreational uses, an aerial photography drone is an aircraft that has first-person video, autonomous capabilities, or both.\nAn unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is defined as a \"powered, aerial vehicle that does not carry a human operator, uses aerodynamic forces to provide vehicle lift, can fly autonomously or be piloted remotely, can be expendable or recoverable, and can carry a lethal or nonlethal payload\". UAV is a term that is commonly applied to military use cases. Missiles with warheads are generally not considered UAVs because the vehicle itself is a munition, but certain types of propeller-based missile are often called \"kamikaze drones\" by the public and media. Also, the relation of UAVs to remote controlled model aircraft is unclear in some jurisdictions. The US FAA now defines any unmanned flying craft as a UAV regardless of weight. A similar term is remotely piloted aerial vehicle (RPAV).\nUAVs or RPAVs can also be seen as a component of an unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which also includes a ground-based controller and a system of communications with the aircraft. \nThe term UAS was adopted by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in 2005 according to their Unmanned Aircraft System Roadmap 2005\u20132030. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the British Civil Aviation Authority adopted this term, also used in the European Union's Single European Sky (SES) Air Traffic Management (ATM) Research (SESAR Joint Undertaking) roadmap for 2020. This term emphasizes the importance of elements other than the aircraft. It includes elements such as ground control stations, data links and other support equipment. Similar terms are unmanned aircraft vehicle system (UAVS) and remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS). Many similar terms are in use. Under new regulations which came into effect 1 June 2019, the term RPAS has been adopted by the Canadian government to mean \"a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its control station, the command and control links and any other system elements required during flight operation\".\nThe term \"Uncrewed\" is sometimes used rather than \"unmanned\" when referring to UAVs.\nClassification types.\nUAVs may be classified like any other aircraft, according to design configuration such as weight or engine type, maximum flight altitude, degree of operational autonomy, operational role, etc. According to the United States Department of Defense, UAVs are classified into five categories below:\nOther classifications of UAVs include:\nRange and endurance.\nThere are usually five categories when UAVs are classified by range and endurance:\nSize.\nThere are usually four categories when UAVs are classified by size, with at least one of the dimensions (length or wingspan) meet the following respective limits:\nWeight.\nBased on their weight, drones can be classified into five categories:\nNATO uses a similar classification shown below:\nDegree of autonomy.\nDrones can also be classified based on the degree of autonomy in their flight operations. ICAO classifies unmanned aircraft as either remotely piloted aircraft or fully autonomous. Some UAVs offer intermediate degrees of autonomy. For example, a vehicle may be remotely piloted in most contexts but have an autonomous return-to-base operation. Some aircraft types may optionally fly manned or as UAVs, which may include manned aircraft transformed into manned or optionally piloted UAVs (OPVs). The flight of UAVs may operate under remote control by a human operator, as remotely piloted aircraft (RPA), or with various degrees of autonomy, such as autopilot assistance, up to fully autonomous aircraft that have no provision for human intervention.\nAltitude.\nBased on the altitude, the following UAV classifications have been used at industry events such as ParcAberporth Unmanned Systems forum:\nComposite criteria.\nAn example of classification based on the composite criteria is U.S. Military's unmanned aerial systems (UAS) classification of UAVs based on weight, maximum altitude and speed of the UAV component.\nLift type.\nFFLO.\n\"Forward flight lift only\" classified by ICAO with the aircraft type designator FFLO - UAV refers to plane-like drones \nVFHC.\n\"Vertical flight/hover capability\" classified by ICAO with the aircraft type designator VFHC - UAV refers to drones using rotaing blades for lift as well as motion\nPower sources.\nUAVs can be classified based on their power or energy source, which significantly impacts their flight duration, range, and environmental impact. The main categories include:\nHistory.\n1800's.\nEarly drones.\nThe earliest recorded use of an unmanned aerial vehicle for warfighting occurred in July 1849, with a balloon carrier (the precursor to the aircraft carrier) in the first offensive use of air power in naval aviation. Austrian forces besieging Venice attempted to launch some 200 incendiary balloons at the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from the Austrian ship . At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship \"Vulcano\".\nThe Spanish engineer Leonardo Torres Quevedo introduced a radio-based control-system called the at the Paris Academy of Science in 1903, as a way of testing airships without risking human life.\n1900's.\nSignificant development of drones started in the 1900s, and originally focused on providing practice targets for training military personnel. The earliest attempt at a powered UAV was A. M. Low's \"Aerial Target\" in 1916. Low confirmed that Geoffrey de Havilland's monoplane was the one that flew under control on 21 March 1917 using his radio system. Following this successful demonstration in the spring of 1917 Low was transferred to develop aircraft controlled fast motor launches D.C.B.s with the Royal Navy in 1918 intended to attack shipping and port installations and he also assisted Wing Commander Brock in preparations for the Zeebrugge Raid. Other British unmanned developments followed, leading to the fleet of over 400 de Havilland 82 Queen Bee aerial targets that went into service in 1935.\nNikola Tesla described a fleet of uncrewed aerial combat vehicles in 1915. These developments also inspired the construction of the Kettering Bug by Charles Kettering from Dayton, Ohio and the Hewitt-Sperry Automatic Airplane \u2013 initially meant as an uncrewed plane that would carry an explosive payload to a predetermined target. Development continued during World War I, when the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company invented a pilotless aerial torpedo that would explode at a preset time.\nThe film star and model-airplane enthusiast Reginald Denny developed the first scaled remote piloted vehicle in 1935.\nSoviet researchers experimented with controlling Tupolev TB-1 bombers remotely in the late 1930s.\nWorld War II.\nIn 1940, Denny started the Radioplane Company and more models emerged during World War II\u00a0\u2013 used both to train antiaircraft gunners and to fly attack-missions. Nazi Germany produced and used various UAV aircraft during the war, like the Argus As 292 and the V-1 flying bomb with a jet engine. Fascist Italy developed a specialised drone version of the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 flown by remote control, although the Armistice with Italy was enacted prior to any operational deployment.\nPostwar period.\nAfter World War II development continued in vehicles such as the American JB-4 (using television/radio-command guidance), the Australian GAF Jindivik and Teledyne Ryan Firebee I of 1951, while companies like Beechcraft offered their Model 1001 for the U.S. Navy in 1955. Nevertheless, they were little more than remote-controlled airplanes until the Vietnam War. In 1959, the U.S. Air Force, concerned about losing pilots over hostile territory, began planning for the use of uncrewed aircraft. Planning intensified after the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 in 1960. Within days, a highly classified UAV program started under the code name of \"Red Wagon\". The August 1964 clash in the Tonkin Gulf between naval units of the U.S. and the North Vietnamese Navy initiated America's highly classified UAVs (Ryan Model 147, Ryan AQM-91 Firefly, Lockheed D-21) into their first combat missions of the Vietnam War. When the Chinese government showed photographs of downed U.S. UAVs via \"Wide World Photos\", the official U.S. response was \"no comment\".\nDuring the War of Attrition (1967\u20131970) in the Middle East, Israeli intelligence tested the first tactical UAVs installed with reconnaissance cameras, which successfully returned photos from across the Suez Canal. This was the first time that tactical UAVs that could be launched and landed on any short runway (unlike the heavier jet-based UAVs) were developed and tested in battle.\nIn the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Israel used UAVs as decoys to spur opposing forces into wasting expensive anti-aircraft missiles. After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, a few key people from the team that developed this early UAV joined a small startup company that aimed to develop UAVs into a commercial product, eventually purchased by Tadiran and leading to the development of the first Israeli UAV.\nIn 1973, the U.S. military officially confirmed that they had been using UAVs in Southeast Asia (Vietnam). Over 5,000 U.S. airmen had been killed and over 1,000 more were missing or captured. The USAF 100th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing flew about 3,435 UAV missions during the war at a cost of about 554 UAVs lost to all causes. In the words of USAF General George S. Brown, Commander, Air Force Systems Command, in 1972, \"The only reason we need (UAVs) is that we don't want to needlessly expend the man in the cockpit.\" Later that year, General John C. Meyer, Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command, stated, \"we let the drone do the high-risk flying\u00a0... the loss rate is high, but we are willing to risk more of them\u00a0...they save lives!\"\nDuring the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Soviet-supplied surface-to-air missile-batteries in Egypt and Syria caused heavy damage to Israeli fighter jets. As a result, Israel developed the IAI Scout as the first UAV with real-time surveillance. The images and radar decoys provided by these UAVs helped Israel to completely neutralize the Syrian air defenses at the start of the 1982 Lebanon War, resulting in no pilots downed. In Israel in 1987, UAVs were first used as proof-of-concept of super-agility, post-stall controlled flight in combat-flight simulations that involved tailless, stealth-technology-based, three-dimensional thrust vectoring flight-control, and jet-steering.\nPost-Cold War UAVs.\nWith the maturing and miniaturization of applicable technologies in the 1980s and 1990s, interest in UAVs grew within the higher echelons of the U.S. military. The U.S. funded the Counterterrorism Center (CTC) within the CIA, which sought to fight terrorism with the aid of modernized drone technology. In the 1990s, the U.S. DoD gave a contract to AAI Corporation along with Israeli company Malat. The U.S. Navy bought the AAI Pioneer UAV that AAI and Malat developed jointly. Many of these UAVs saw service in the 1991 Gulf War. UAVs demonstrated the possibility of cheaper, more capable fighting-machines, deployable without risk to aircrews. Initial generations primarily involved surveillance aircraft, but some carried armaments, such as the General Atomics MQ-1 Predator, that launched AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles.\n2000s.\nCAPECON, a European Union project to develop UAVs, ran from 1 May 2002 to 31 December 2005.\nAs of 2012[ [update]], the United States Air Force (USAF) employed 7,494 UAVs\u00a0\u2013 almost one in three USAF aircraft. The Central Intelligence Agency also operated UAVs. By 2013 at least 50 countries used UAVs. China, Iran, Israel, Pakistan, Turkey, and others designed and built their own varieties. The use of drones has continued to increase. Due to their wide proliferation, no comprehensive list of UAV systems exists.\nIn 2006, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allowed the usage of unmanned aerial vehicles inside civilian airspace with specific regulations, laying out legal groundwork for consumer drone usage inside the United States.\nIn 2013, DJI released the first model of the Phantom drone, DJI's fully assembled drone model. Priced at $629, Phantom was an entry-level drone, featuring much more user-friendly experiences than other drones on the market at the time. The DJI Phantom was considered one of the most influential consumer drone products ever made. With its affordability, accessibility, and user-friendly software, it quickly captured the consumer drone market from hobbyists, professionals, and introduced the modern aerial photography drone form factor to the general public. By 2017, DJI alone had over 75% of the global consumer drone market share.\nIn 2020, a Kargu 2 drone hunted down and attacked a human target in Libya, according to a report from the UN Security Council's Panel of Experts on Libya, published in March 2021. This may have been the first time an autonomous killer-robot armed with lethal weaponry attacked human beings.\nSuperior drone technology, specifically the Turkish Bayraktar TB2, played a role in Azerbaijan's successes in the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war against Armenia.\nUAVs are also used in NASA missions. The \"Ingenuity\" helicopter is an autonomous UAV that operated on Mars from 2021 to 2024. As of 2024[ [update]] the Dragonfly spacecraft is being developed and is aiming to reach and examine Saturn's moon Titan. Its primary goal is to roam around the surface, expanding the amount of area to be researched previously seen by landers. As a UAV, Dragonfly allows examination of potentially diverse types of soil. The drone is set to launch in 2027, and is estimated to take seven more years to reach the Saturnian system.\nMiniaturization is also supporting the development of small UAVs, which can be used as an individual system or in a fleet, offering the possibility to survey large areas in a relatively small amount of time.\nThe April 2024 Iranian strikes against Israel took place on 13 April 2024 when the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and other groups of the Axis of Resistance launched about 300 drones at Israel, a distance of about 1,500 kilometers.\nAccording to data from GlobalData, the global military uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) market, which forms a significant part of the UAV industry, is projected to experience a compound annual growth rate of 4.8% over the next decade. This represents a near doubling in market size, from $12.5 billion in 2024 to an estimated $20 billion by 2034.\nRusso-Ukrainian war.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 was widely described as the first full-scale war featuring the large-scale use of commercial and consumer-grade UAVs in military settings, particularly quadcopters and first-person view (FPV) drones, modified with sensors and explosives for various missions and tactical usage. The cheap and widely available consumer drone and small UAVs have dramatically shifted modern warfare and given rise to new offensive and defensive strategies.\nBoth Ukraine and Russia used small consumer drones extensively during the war, which served as a tactical surveillance, strike, and propaganda tools. Consumer drones were sourced by governments, hobbyists, international donations to Ukraine and Russia to support each side on the battlefield, and were often flown by drone hobbyists recruited by the armed forces. Consumer drones' affordability, high performance, and reliability contributed to their popularity. They were also preferred for their commercial availability. Companies attempted to restrict military usage of consumer product, but effect was limited, as donors and buyers could ship the drones across the border via intermediates and modified their software to circumnavigate the restrictions. In Ukraine, small commercial UAVs and FPV drones had become an ubiquitous and critical part of the war.\nDesign.\nCrewed and uncrewed aircraft of the same type generally have recognizably similar physical components. The main exceptions are the cockpit and environmental control system or life-support systems. Some UAVs carry payloads (such as a camera) that weigh considerably less than an adult human, and as a result, can be considerably smaller. Though they carry heavy payloads, weaponized military UAVs are lighter than their crewed counterparts with comparable armaments.\nSmall civilian UAVs have no life-critical systems, and can thus be built out of lighter but less sturdy materials and shapes, and can use less robustly tested electronic control systems. For small UAVs, the quadcopter design has become popular, though this layout is rarely used for crewed aircraft. Miniaturization means that less-powerful propulsion technologies can be used that are not feasible for crewed aircraft, such as small electric motors and batteries.\nControl systems for UAVs are often different from crewed craft. For remote human control, a camera and video link almost always replace the cockpit windows; radio-transmitted digital commands replace physical cockpit controls. Autopilot software is used on both crewed and uncrewed aircraft, with varying feature sets.\nAircraft configuration.\nUAVs can be designed in different configurations than manned aircraft, both because there is no need for a cockpit and its windows, and there is no need to optimize for human comfort, although some UAVs are adapted from piloted examples, or are designed for optionally piloted modes. Air safety is also less of a critical requirement for unmanned aircraft, allowing the designer greater freedom to experiment. Instead, UAVs are typically designed around their onboard payloads and their ground equipment. These factors have led to a great variety of airframe and motor configurations in UAVs.\nFor conventional flight, the flying wing and blended wing body offer light weight combined with low drag and stealth, and are popular configurations for many use cases. Larger types which carry a variable payload are more likely to feature a distinct fuselage with a tail for stability, control and trim, although the wing configurations in use vary widely.\nFor uses that require vertical flight or hovering, the tailless quadcopter requires a relatively simple control system and is common for smaller UAVs. Multirotor designs with 6 or more rotors is more common with larger UAVs, where redundancy is prioritized.\nPropulsion.\nTraditional internal combustion and jet engines remain in use for drones requiring long range. However, for shorter-range missions electric power has almost entirely taken over. The distance record for a UAV (built from balsa wood and mylar skin) across the North Atlantic Ocean is held by a gasoline model airplane or UAV. Manard Hill \"in 2003 when one of his creations flew 1,882 miles across the Atlantic Ocean on less than a gallon of fuel\" holds this record.\nBesides the traditional piston engine, the Wankel rotary engine is used by some drones. This type offers high power output for lower weight, with quieter and more vibration-free running. Claims have also been made for improved reliability and greater range.\nSmall drones mostly use lithium-polymer batteries (Li-Po), while some larger vehicles have adopted the hydrogen fuel cell. Hydrogen-fueled proton-exchange membrane fuel cells for UAVs have the advantages of longer flight duration than rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, of lower total cost of ownership than primary lithium metal batteries and of better stealth than heat engines.\nThe energy density of modern Li-Po batteries is far less than gasoline or hydrogen. However, electric motors are cheaper, lighter and quieter. Complex multi-engine, multi-propeller installations are under development with the goal of improving aerodynamic and propulsive efficiency. For such complex power installations, battery elimination circuitry (BEC) may be used to centralize power distribution and minimize heating, under the control of a microcontroller unit (MCU).\nOrnithopters \u2013 wing propulsion.\nFlapping-wing ornithopters, imitating birds or insects, have been flown as microUAVs. Their inherent stealth recommends them for spy missions.\nSub-1g microUAVs inspired by flies, albeit using a power tether, have been able to \"land\" on vertical surfaces. Other projects mimic the flight of beetles and other insects.\nComputer control systems.\nUAV computing capability followed the advances of computing technology, beginning with analog controls and evolving into microcontrollers, then system-on-a-chip (SOC) and single-board computers (SBC).\nModern system hardware for UAV control is often called the flight controller (FC), flight controller board (FCB) or autopilot. Common UAV-systems control hardware typically incorporate a primary microprocessor, a secondary or failsafe processor, and sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and barometers into a single module.\nIn 2024 EASA agreed on the first certification basis for a UAV flight controller in compliance with the ETSO-C198 for Embention's autopilot. The certification of the UAV flight control systems aims to facilitate the integration of UAVs within the airspace and the operation of drones in critical areas.\nArchitecture.\nSensors.\nPosition and movement sensors give information about the aircraft state. Exteroceptive sensors deal with external information like distance measurements, while exproprioceptive ones correlate internal and external states.\nNon-cooperative sensors are able to detect targets autonomously so they are used for separation assurance and collision avoidance.\nDegrees of freedom (DOF) refers to both the amount and quality of onboard sensors: 6 DOF implies 3-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers (a typical inertial measurement unit\u00a0\u2013 IMU), 9 DOF refers to an IMU plus a compass, 10 DOF adds a barometer and 11 DOF usually adds a GPS receiver.\nIn addition to the navigation sensors, the UAV (or UAS) can be also equipped with monitoring devices such as: RGB, multispectral, hyper-spectral cameras or LiDAR, which may allow providing specific measurements or observations.\nActuators.\nUAV actuators include digital electronic speed controllers (which control the RPM of the motors) linked to motors/engines and propellers, servomotors (for planes and helicopters mostly), weapons, payload actuators, LEDs and speakers.\nSoftware.\nModern UAVs run a software stack that ranges from low-level firmware that directly controls actuators, to high level flight planning. At the lowest level, firmware directly controls reading from sensors such as an IMU and commanding actuators such as motors. Control software (often referred to as an autopilot) is responsible for computing actuator speeds given desired vehicle velocity. Due to its direct interaction with hardware, this software is time-critical and may run on microcontrollers. This software may also handle radio communications, in the case of UAVs that are not autonomous. One popular example is the PX4 autopilot.\nAt the next level, autonomy algorithms compute the desired velocity given higher level goals. For example, trajectory optimization may be used to calculate a flight trajectory given a desired goal location. This software is not necessarily time-critical, and can often run on a single board computer running an operating system such as Linux with relaxed time constraints.\nDeep reinforcement learning has also been investigated for UAV flight control, particularly for navigating continuous three-dimensional environments and improving autonomous decision-making.\nLoop principles.\nUAVs employ open-loop, closed-loop or hybrid control architectures.\nCommunications.\nUAVs use a radio for control and exchange of video and other data. Early UAVs had only narrowband uplink. Downlinks came later. These bi-directional narrowband radio links carried command and control (C&amp;C) and telemetry data about the status of aircraft systems to the remote operator.\nIn most modern UAV applications, video transmission is required. So instead of having separate links for C&amp;C, telemetry and video traffic, a broadband link is used to carry all types of data. These broadband links can leverage quality of service techniques and carry TCP/IP traffic that can be routed over the internet.\nThe radio signal from the operator side can be issued from either:\nModern networking standards have explicitly considered drones and therefore include optimizations. The 5G standard has mandated reduced user plane latency to 1ms while using ultra-reliable and low-latency communications.\nUAV-to-UAV coordination supported by Remote ID communication technology. Remote ID messages (containing the UAV coordinates) are broadcast and can be used for collision-free navigation.\nAutonomy.\nThe level of autonomy in UAVs varies widely. UAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations, such as:\nOne approach to quantifying autonomous capabilities is based on OODA terminology, as suggested by a 2002 US Air Force Research Laboratory report, and used in the table on the right.\nFull autonomy is available for specific tasks, such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching.\nOther functions available or under development include; collective flight, real-time collision avoidance, wall following, corridor centring, simultaneous localization and mapping and swarming, cognitive radio, and machine learning. In this context, computer vision can play an important role for automatically ensuring flight safety.\nPerformance considerations.\nFlight envelope.\nUAVs can be programmed to perform aggressive maneuvers or landing/perching on inclined surfaces, and then to climb toward better communication spots. Some UAVs can control flight with varying flight modelisation, such as VTOL designs.\nUAVs can also implement perching on a flat vertical surface.\nEndurance.\nUAV endurance is not constrained by the physiological capabilities of a human pilot.\nBecause of their small size, low weight, low vibration and high power to weight ratio, Wankel rotary engines are used in many large UAVs. Their engine rotors cannot seize; the engine is not susceptible to shock-cooling during descent and it does not require an enriched fuel mixture for cooling at high power. These attributes reduce fuel usage, increasing range or payload.\nProper drone cooling is essential for long-term drone endurance. Overheating and subsequent engine failure is the most common cause of drone failure.\nHydrogen fuel cells, using hydrogen power, may be able to extend the endurance of small UAVs, up to several hours.\nMicro air vehicles endurance is so far best achieved with flapping-wing UAVs, followed by planes and multirotors standing last, due to lower Reynolds number.\nSolar-electric UAVs, a concept originally championed by the AstroFlight Sunrise in 1974, have achieved flight times of several weeks.\nSolar-powered atmospheric satellites (\"atmosats\") designed for operating at altitudes exceeding 20\u00a0km (12 miles, or 60,000 feet) for as long as five years could potentially perform duties more economically and with more versatility than low Earth orbit satellites. Likely applications include weather drones for weather monitoring, disaster recovery, Earth imaging and communications.\nElectric UAVs powered by microwave power transmission or laser power beaming are other potential endurance solutions.\nAnother application for a high endurance UAV would be to \"stare\" at a battlefield for a long interval (ARGUS-IS, Gorgon Stare, Integrated Sensor Is Structure) to record events that could then be played backwards to track battlefield activities.\nThe delicacy of the British PHASA-35 military drone (at a late stage of development) is such that traversing the first turbulent twelve miles of atmosphere is a hazardous endeavor. It has, however, remained on station at 65,000 feet for 24 hours. Airbus' Zephyr in 2023 has attained 70,000 feet and flown for 64 days; 200 days aimed at. This is sufficiently close enough to near-space for them to be regarded in \"pseudo-satellites\" as regards to their operational capabilities.\nReliability.\nReliability improvements target all aspects of UAV systems, using resilience engineering and fault tolerance techniques.\nIndividual reliability covers robustness of flight controllers, to ensure safety without excessive redundancy to minimize cost and weight. Besides, dynamic assessment of flight envelope allows damage-resilient UAVs, using non-linear analysis with ad hoc designed loops or neural networks. UAV software liability is bending toward the design and certifications of crewed avionics software.\nSwarm resilience involves maintaining operational capabilities and reconfiguring tasks given unit failures.\nApplications.\nIn recent years, autonomous drones have begun to transform various application areas as they can fly beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) while maximizing production, reducing costs and risks, ensuring site safety, security and regulatory compliance, and protecting the human workforce in times of a pandemic. They can also be used for consumer-related missions like package delivery, as demonstrated by Amazon Prime Air, and critical deliveries of health supplies.\nThere are numerous civilian, commercial, military, and aerospace applications for UAVs. These include:\nWarfare.\nAs of 2020, seventeen countries have armed UAVs, and more than 100 countries use UAVs in a military capacity. The first five countries producing domestic UAV designs are the United States, China, Israel, Iran and Turkey. Top military UAV manufactures are including General Atomics, Elbit Systems, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, Baykar, TAI, IAIO, CASC and CAIG. China has established and expanded its presence in military UAV market since 2010. In the early 2020s, Turkey also established and expanded its presence in the military UAV market.\nIn the early 2010s, Israeli companies mainly focused on small surveillance UAV systems, and by the number of drones, Israel exported 60.7% (2014) of UAVs on the market while the United States exported 23.9% (2014). Between 2010 and 2014, there were 439 drones exchanged compared to 322 in the five years previous to that, among these only small fraction of overall trade \u2013 just 11 (2.5%) of the 439 are armed drones. The US alone operated over 9,000 military UAVs in 2014; among them more than 7000 are RQ-11 Raven miniature UAVs. Since 2010, Chinese drone companies have begun to export large quantities of drones to the global military market. Of the 18 countries that are known to have received military drones between 2010 and 2019, the top 12 all purchased their drones from China. The shift accelerated in the 2020s due to China's advancement in drone technologies and manufacturing, compounded by market demand from the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza conflict.\nFor intelligence and reconnaissance missions, the inherent stealth of micro UAV flapping-wing ornithopters, imitating birds or insects, offers potential for covert surveillance and makes them difficult targets to bring down.\nUnmanned surveillance and reconnaissance aerial vehicle are used for reconnaissance, attack, demining, and target practice.\nFollowing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a dramatic increase in UAV development took place with Ukraine creating the Brave1 platform to promote rapid development of innovative systems.\nCivil applications.\nThe civilian (commercial and general) drone market is dominated by Chinese companies. Chinese manufacturer DJI alone had 74% of the civil market share in 2018, with no other company accounting for more than 5%. The companies continue to hold over 70% of global market share by 2023, despite under increasing scrutinies and sanctions from the United States. The US Interior Department grounded its fleet of DJI drones in 2020, while the Justice Department prohibited the use of federal funds for the purchase of DJI and other foreign-made UAVs. \nDJI is followed by American company 3D Robotics, Chinese company Yuneec, Autel Robotics, and French company Parrot. In 2025, Chinese drone companies held 90% of the global UAV market share, with DJI accounting 80 percent of the world market.\nAs of May 2021, 873,576 UAVs had been registered with the US FAA, of which 42% were categorized as commercial and 58% as recreational. 2018 NPD point to consumers increasingly purchasing drones with more advanced features with 33 percent growth in both the $500+ and $1000+ market segments.\nThe civil UAV market is relatively new compared to the military one. Companies are emerging in both developed and developing nations at the same time. Many early-stage startups have received support and funding from investors, as is the case in the United States, and from government agencies, as is the case in India. Some universities offer research and training programs or degrees. Private entities also provide online and in-person training programs for both recreational and commercial UAV use.\nConsumer drones are widely used by police and military organizations worldwide because of the cost-effective nature of consumer products. Since 2018, the Israeli military have used DJI UAVs for light reconnaissance missions. DJI drones have been used by Chinese police in Xinjiang since 2017 and American police departments nationwide since 2018. Both Ukraine and Russia used commercial DJI drones extensively during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. These civilian DJI drones were sourced by governments, hobbyists, international donations to Ukraine and Russia to support each side on the battlefield, and were often flown by drone hobbyists recruited by the armed forces. The prevalence of DJI drones was attributable to their market dominance, affordability, high performance, and reliability.\nEntertainment.\nDrones are also used in nighttime displays for artistic and advertising purposes, with the main benefits being that they are safer, quieter, and better for the environment than fireworks. They can replace or be an adjunct to fireworks displays to reduce the financial burden of festivals. In addition they can complement fireworks due to the ability for drones to carry them, creating new forms of artwork in the process.\nDrones can also be used for racing, either with or without VR functionality.\nAerial photography.\nDrones are ideally suited to capturing aerial shots in photography and cinematography, and are widely used for this purpose. Small drones avoid the need for precise coordination between pilot and cameraman, with the same person taking on both roles. Big drones with professional cine cameras usually have a drone pilot and a camera operator who controls the camera angle and lens. For example, the AERIGON cinema drone, used in film production, is operated by two people. Drones provide access to dangerous, remote, or otherwise inaccessible sites.\nEnvironmental monitoring.\nUASs or UAVs offer a great advantage for environmental monitoring to generate a new generation of survey at very-high or ultra-high resolution both in space and time. This gives the opportunity to bridge the existing gap between satellite data and field monitoring. This has stimulated a huge number of activities in order to enhance the description of natural and agricultural ecosystems. Most common applications are:\nThese activities can be completed with different measurements, such as photogrammetry, thermography, multispectral images, 3D field scanning, gas detectors, and normalized difference vegetation index maps.\nGeological hazards.\nUAVs have become a widely used tool for studying geohazards such as landslides. Various sensors, including radar, optical, and thermal, can be mounted on UAVs to monitor different properties. UAVs enable the capture of images of various landslide features, such as transverse, radial, and longitudinal cracks, ridges, scarps, and surfaces of rupture, even in inaccessible areas of the sliding mass. Moreover, processing the optical images captured by UAVs also allows for the creation of point clouds and 3D models, from which these properties can be derived. Comparing point clouds obtained at different times allows for the detection of changes caused by landslide deformation.\nMineral exploration.\nUAVs may help in the discovery of new or reevaluation of known mineral deposits to meet the demand for raw materials such as critical raw metals (e.g. cobalt, nickel), rare earths and battery minerals. By employing a suite of sensors (e.g. spectral imaging, Lidar, magnetics, gamma-ray spectroscopy), and similar to those used in environmental monitoring, UAV-based data can produce maps of geological surface and subsurface features, contributing to more efficient and targeted mineral exploration.\nAgriculture, forestry and environmental studies.\nAs global demand for food production grows exponentially, resources are depleted, farmland is reduced, and agricultural labor is increasingly in short supply, there is an urgent need for more convenient and smarter agricultural solutions than traditional methods, and the agricultural drone and robotics industry is expected to make progress. Agricultural drones have been used to help build sustainable agriculture all over the world leading to a new generation of agriculture. In this context, there is a proliferation of innovations in both tools and methodologies which allow precise description of vegetation state and also may help to precisely distribute nutrients, pesticides or seeds over a field.\nThe use of UAVs is also being investigated to help detect and fight wildfires, whether through observation or launching pyrotechnic devices to start backfires.\nUAVs are also now widely used to survey wildlife such as nesting seabirds, seals and even wombat burrows.\nLaw enforcement.\nPolice can use drones for applications such as search and rescue and traffic monitoring.\nHumanitarian aid.\nDrones are increasingly finding their application in humanitarian aid and disaster relief, where they are used for a wide range of applications such as delivering food, medicine and essential items to remote areas or image mapping before and following disasters.\nSafety and security.\nThreats.\nNuisance.\nUAVs can threaten airspace security in numerous ways, including unintentional collisions or other interference with other aircraft, deliberate attacks or by distracting pilots or flight controllers. The first incident of a drone-airplane collision occurred in mid-October 2017 in Quebec City, Canada. The first recorded instance of a drone collision with a hot air balloon occurred on 10 August 2018 in Driggs, Idaho, United States; although there was no significant damage to the balloon nor any injuries to its 3 occupants, the balloon pilot reported the incident to the National Transportation Safety Board, stating that \"I hope this incident helps create a conversation of respect for nature, the airspace, and rules and regulations\". Unauthorized UAV flights into or near major airports have prompted extended shutdowns of commercial flights.\nDrones caused significant disruption at Gatwick Airport during December 2018, needing the deployment of the British Army.\nIn the United States, flying close to a wildfire is punishable by a maximum $25,000 fine. Nonetheless, in 2014 and 2015, firefighting air support in California was hindered on several occasions, including at the Lake Fire and the North Fire. In response, California legislators introduced a bill that would allow firefighters to disable UAVs which invaded restricted airspace. The FAA later required registration of most UAVs.\nSecurity vulnerabilities.\nBy 2017, drones were being used to drop contraband into prisons.\nThe interest in UAVs cybersecurity has been raised greatly after the Predator UAV video stream hijacking incident in 2009, where Islamic militants used cheap, off-the-shelf equipment to stream video feeds from a UAV. Another risk is the possibility of hijacking or jamming a UAV in flight. Several security researchers have made public some vulnerabilities in commercial UAVs, in some cases even providing full source code or tools to reproduce their attacks. At a workshop on UAVs and privacy in October 2016, researchers from the Federal Trade Commission showed they were able to hack into three different consumer quadcopters and noted that UAV manufacturers can make their UAVs more secure by the basic security measures of encrypting the Wi-Fi signal and adding password protection.\nAggression.\nMany UAVs have been loaded with dangerous payloads, and/or crashed into targets. Payloads have included or could include explosives, chemical, radiological or biological hazards. UAVs with generally non-lethal payloads could possibly be hacked and put to malicious purposes. Counter-UAV systems (C-UAS), from detection to electronic warfare to UAVs designed to destroy other UAVs, are in development and being deployed by states to counter this threat.\nSuch developments have occurred despite the difficulties. As J. Rogers stated in a 2017 interview to A&amp;T, \"There is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to counter these small UAVs, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor\".\nCountermeasures.\nCounter unmanned air system.\nThe malicious use of UAVs has led to the development of counter unmanned air system (C-UAS) technologies. Automatic tracking and detection of UAVs from commercial cameras have become accurate thanks to the development of deep learning based machine learning algorithms. It is also possible to automatically identify UAVs across different cameras with different viewpoints and hardware specification with re-identification methods. Commercial systems such as the Aaronia AARTOS have been installed on major international airports. Once a UAV is detected, it can be countered with kinetic force (missiles, projectiles or another UAV) or by non-kinetic force (laser, microwaves, communications jamming). Anti-aircraft missile systems such as the Iron Dome are also being enhanced with C-UAS technologies. Utilising a smart UAV swarm to counter one or more hostile UAVs is also proposed.\nA variety of counter-UAS (C-UAS) systems have been developed globally to address the growing threat of small and tactical UAVs. These include multi-layered approaches combining radar, electro-optical sensors, radio frequency detection, and jamming technologies. Among them are systems developed by Elbit Systems, such as the ReDrone\u2122 suite, which includes both fixed and portable configurations for detection and mitigation of drones in civilian and military environments. The Red Sky 2 system, also developed by Elbit, integrates multiple sensors and effectors and is designed to protect strategic sites from low-altitude aerial threats.\nRegulation.\nRegulatory bodies around the world are developing unmanned aircraft system traffic management solutions to better integrate UAVs into airspace.\nThe use of unmanned aerial vehicles is becoming increasingly regulated by the civil aviation authorities of individual countries. Regulatory regimes can differ significantly according to drone size and use. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) began exploring the use of drone technology as far back as 2005, which resulted in a 2011 report. France was among the first countries to set a national framework based on this report and larger aviation bodies such as the FAA and the EASA quickly followed suit. In 2021, the FAA published a rule requiring all commercially used UAVs and all UAVs regardless of intent weighing 250 g or more to participate in Remote ID, which makes drone locations, controller locations, and other information public from takeoff to shutdown; this rule has since been challenged in the pending federal lawsuit \"RaceDayQuads v. FAA\".\nEU Drone Certification \u2013 Class Identification Label.\nThe implementation of the https:// serves a crucial purpose in the regulation and operation of drones. The label is a verification mechanism designed to confirm that drones within a specific class meet the rigorous standards set by administrations for design and manufacturing. These standards are necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of drones in various industries and applications.\nBy providing this assurance to customers, the Class Identification Label helps to increase confidence in drone technology and encourages wider adoption across industries. This, in turn, contributes to the growth and development of the drone industry and supports the integration of drones into society.\nExport controls.\nThe export of UAVs or technology capable of carrying a 500\u00a0kg payload at least 300\u00a0km is restricted in many countries by the Missile Technology Control Regime.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Set at an unspecified date in Earth's future, the novel presents an imperiled humankind after two conflicts with an insectoid alien species they dub \"the buggers\". In preparation for an anticipated third invasion, Earth's international military force recruits young children, including the novel's protagonist, Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin, to be trained as elite officers. The children learn military strategy and leadership by playing increasingly difficult war games, including some in zero gravity, where Ender's tactical genius is revealed.\nThe book originated as a short story of the same name, published in the August 1977 issue of \"Analog Science Fiction and Fact\". The novel was published on January 15, 1985. Later, by elaborating on characters and plotlines depicted in the novel, Card wrote additional books in the \"Ender's Game\" series. Card released an updated version of \"Ender's Game\" in 1991, changing some political facts to account for the then-recent dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. The novel has been translated into 34 languages. In the movie adaptation and novels after the original sequels, \"buggers\" are referred to as \"Formics\".\nReception of the book has been largely positive. It has become suggested reading for military organizations such as the United States Marine Corps. \"Ender's Game\" was recognized as \"best novel\" by the 1985 Nebula Award and the 1986 Hugo Award in the genres of science fiction and fantasy. Its four sequels\u2014\"Speaker for the Dead\" (1986), \"Xenocide\" (1991), \"Children of the Mind\" (1996)\",\" and \"Ender in Exile\" (2008)\"\u2014\"follow Ender's subsequent travels to many different worlds in the galaxy. In addition, the later novella \"A War of Gifts\" (2007) and novel \"Ender's Shadow\" (1999), plus other novels in the \"Shadow\" saga, take place during the same time period as the original.\nA film adaptation of the same name, written for the screen and directed by Gavin Hood, and starring Asa Butterfield as Ender, was released in October 2013. Card co-produced the film. The novel has also been adapted into two comic book series.\nPlot.\nWar breaks out between humans and an insect-like alien race referred to as \"buggers\". The humans are able to repel the First and Second Invasions by narrow margins. Earth's space military force is the International Fleet (I.F.), which trains gifted children to become commanders at their orbiting Battle School.\nAndrew \"Ender\" Wiggin is born a \"Third\": a rare exception to Earth's two-child policy, allowed by the government due to the promise and high intellect displayed by his two older siblings. The eldest, Peter, is a sociopath who bullies Ender. His sister, Valentine, is deeply empathic. The I.F. removed Ender's monitoring device when he was six years old, seemingly ending his chances of Battle School. He is taunted and pushed around by his classmates, led by a school bully named Stilson. Ender viciously retaliates against Stilson. Ender is disturbed that he, through his actions, is becoming more like his brother Peter. Unbeknownst to Ender, Stilson later dies from his wounds. Colonel Hyrum Graff visits Ender after hearing about the fight. Ender attests that by showing superiority now, he has prevented future struggle. Graff offers him a place in the Battle School.\nOnce at Battle School, Graff and the other leaders covertly work to keep Ender isolated. Ender finds solace in playing a simulated adventure game that involves being killed by and eventually killing a giant. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the competition with novel tactics. To further wear Ender down, he is promoted to command a new army composed of new recruits, then pitted against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. Ender's jealous ex-commander, Bonzo Madrid, draws him into a fight outside the simulation, and once again seeking to preemptively stop future conflicts, Ender uses excessive force, and Bonzo dies from his injuries without Ender being notified.\nMeanwhile on Earth, Peter Wiggin uses a global communication system to post political essays under the pseudonym \"Locke\", hoping to establish himself as a respected orator and then as a powerful politician. Valentine, despite not trusting Peter, agrees to publish alongside him as \"Demosthenes\". Their essays are soon taken seriously by the government and the people.\nEnder, now ten years old, is promoted to Command School. After some preliminary battles in the simulator, he is introduced to Mazer Rackham, a hero from the First and Second Invasions who saw key patterns in the bugger behavior. Ender participates in space combat simulations created and controlled by Mazer. As the fighting becomes harder, he is joined by some of his friends from the Battle School as sub-commanders. Ender grows depressed by the battles, his isolation, and the way Mazer treats him.\nFor his final test, under observation by I.F.'s commanders, Ender finds his fleet far outnumbered by bugger ships surrounding their homeworld. He sacrifices his entire fleet to fire a Molecular Disruption Device at the planet. The Device destroys the planet and paralyzes the surrounding bugger fleet. The commanders cheer and celebrate. Mazer informs Ender that the \"simulations\" were real battles, directing human spacecraft against bugger fleets via an ansible and that Ender has won the war. Ender realizes that he has committed xenocide and become just like Peter, additionally learning about the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo.\nEnder and Valentine join a group of space colonists. On their new planet, Ender becomes the colony's governor. He discovers a structure that matches the simulation of the giant game from Battle School and inside finds the dormant egg of a queen. The bugger queen telepathically communicates to Ender that before the First Invasion, they had assumed humans were a non-sentient race, for want of collective consciousness, but realized their mistake too late. Instead, she had reached out to Ender to draw him here and requested that he take the egg to a new planet for the buggers to colonize.\nEnder takes the egg and, with information from the queen, writes \"The Hive Queen\" under the alias \"Speaker for the Dead\". Peter, now the leader of Earth and 77 with heart failure, recognizes Ender as the author of \"The Hive Queen\". He asks Ender to write a book about him, which Ender titles \"The Hegemon\". The combined works create a new type of funeral, in which the Speaker for the Dead tells the whole and unapologetic story of the deceased, adopted by many on Earth and its colonies. Ender and Valentine leave the colony and travel to other worlds, looking for a safe place to establish the unborn Hive Queen.\nCreation and inspiration.\nThe original \"Ender's Game\" is a short story published in 1977 that conveys Ender's experiences in Battle and Command School, training, and application of his talents.\nAt the age of 16, Card conceived of the 'Battle Room' for zero gravity war game training, considering the common failure of WWII trainee pilots to think in three dimensions, and stories from his older brother about various good and bad aspects of his military training. In a commentary track for the 20th anniversary audiobook edition of the novel, as well as in the 1991 Author's Definitive Edition, Card stated that \"Ender's Game\" was written to establish the character of Ender for his role of the Speaker in \"Speaker for the Dead\", the outline for which he had written before novelizing \"Ender's Game\". Additionally, in the post-script of the 20th anniversary audiobook edition, Card mentions that he named Ender so that he could have a name that sounded like \"endgame\" from chess. In his 1991 introduction to the novel, Card discussed the influence of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series on the novelette and novel. Historian Bruce Catton's work on the American Civil War also influenced Card.\n\"Ender's Game\" was the first science-fiction novel published entirely online, when it appeared on Delphi a year before print publication.\nCritical response.\n\"Ender's Game\" won the Nebula Award for best novel in 1985, and the Hugo Award for best novel in 1986, considered the two most prestigious awards in science fiction. \"Ender's Game\" was also nominated for a Locus Award in 1986. In 1999, it placed No.\u00a059 on the reader's list of Modern Library 100 Best Novels. It was also honored with a spot on American Library Association's \"100 Best Books for Teens\". In 2008, the novel, along with \"Ender's Shadow\", won the Margaret A. Edwards Award, which honors an author and specific works by that author for lifetime contribution to young adult literature. \"Ender's Game\" was included in Damien Broderick's book \"Science Fiction: The 101 Best Novels 1985\u20132010\". It ranked number nine on Locus's top SF novels published before 1990.\n\"The New York Times\" writer Gerald Jonas asserts that the novel's plot summary resembles a \"grade Z, made-for-television, science-fiction rip-off movie\", but says that Card develops the elements well despite this \"unpromising material\". Jonas further praises the development of the character Ender Wiggin: \"Alternately likable and insufferable, he is a convincing little Napoleon in short pants.\"\nThe novel has received criticism for its portrayal of violence and its justification. Elaine Radford's review, \"Ender and Hitler: Sympathy for the Superman\", posits that Ender Wiggin is an intentional reference by Card to Adolf Hitler and criticizes the violence in the novel, particularly at the hands of the protagonist. Card responded to Radford's criticisms in \"Fantasy Review\", the same publication. Radford's criticisms are echoed in John Kessel's essay \"Creating the Innocent Killer: Ender's Game, Intention, and Morality\", wherein Kessel states: \"Ender gets to strike out at his enemies and still remain morally clean. \"Nothing\" is his fault.\" Noah Berlatsky makes similar claims in his analysis of the relationship between colonization and science fiction, where he describes \"Ender's Game\" as in part a justification of \"Western expansion and genocide\". However, more recently, science fiction scholar Mike Ryder has refuted the claims of Kessel and Radford, arguing that Ender is exploited by powers beyond his control.\nThe U.S. Marine Corps Professional Reading List makes the novel recommended reading at several lower ranks, and again at Officer Candidate/Midshipman.\nThe book was placed on the reading list by Captain John F. Schmitt, author of FMFM-1 (Fleet Marine Force Manual, on maneuver doctrine) for \"provid[ing] useful allegories to explain why militaries do what they do in a particularly effective shorthand way\".\nIn introducing the novel for use in leadership training, Marine Corps University's Lejeune program opines that it offers \"lessons in training methodology, leadership, and ethics as well. . . . \"Ender's Game\" has been a stalwart item on the Marine Corps Reading List since its inception\". It is also used as an early fictional example of game-based learning.\nAccolades.\nThe weeks ending June 9, August 11, September 1, September 8, October 27, November 3, November 10, and November 24, 2013, the novel was No.\u00a01 on \"The New York Times\"' Best Sellers List of Paperback Mass-Market Fiction.\nRevisions.\nIn 1991, Card made several minor changes to reflect the political climates of the time, including the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In the afterword of \"Ender in Exile\" (2008), Card stated that many of the details in chapter 15 of \"Ender's Game\" were modified for use in the subsequent novels and short stories. In order to more closely match the other material, Card has rewritten chapter 15 and plans to offer a revised edition of the book.\nAdaptations.\nFilm.\nAfter several years of speculation on the possibility, Summit Entertainment financed and coordinated the development of a film in 2011, serving as its distributor. Gavin Hood directed the film, which lasts 1 hour and 54 minutes. Filming began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on February 27, 2012, and was released on November 1, 2013 (USA). A movie preview trailer was released in May 2013 and a second trailer was released later that year.\nCard has called \"Ender's Game\" \"unfilmable\", \"because everything takes place in Ender's head\", and refused to sign a film deal unless he could ensure that the film was \"true to the story\". Of the film that he eventually agreed to, Card said it was \"the best that good people could do with a story they really cared about and believed in\", and while warning fans not to expect a completely faithful adaptation, called the film \"damn good\".\nThe movie starred Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin and Harrison Ford as Colonel Hyrum Graff. It grossed $125 million worldwide, and received mixed reviews from critics.\nVideo game.\nIn 2008, it was announced an Ender's Game video game was in the works. It was to be known as \"Ender's Game: Battle Room\" and was a planned digitally distributed video game for all viable downloadable platforms. It was under development by Chair Entertainment, which also developed the Xbox Live Arcade games \"Undertow\" and \"Shadow Complex\". Chair had sold the licensing of \"Empire\" to Card, which became a bestselling novel. Little was revealed about the game, save its setting in the Ender universe and that it would have focused on the Battle Room.\nIn December 2010, it was announced that the video game development had stopped and the project put on indefinite hold.\nOrson Scott Card and Amaze Entertainment also came to an agreement regarding a video game adaption of the novel but nothing ever materialized.\nComics.\nMarvel Comics and Orson Scott Card announced on April 19, 2008, that they would be publishing a limited series adaptation of \"Ender's Game\" as the first in a comic series that would adapt all of Card's \"Ender's Game\" novels. Card was quoted as saying that it is the first step in moving the story to a visual medium. The first five-issue series, titled ', was written by Christopher Yost, while the second five-issue series, ', was written by Mike Carey.\nAudioplay.\n\"Ender's Game Alive: The Full Cast Audioplay\", is a 2013 audio drama written by Orson Scott Card, based on the \"Ender's Game\" novel. At over seven hours in length, this retelling of \"Ender's Game\" hints at storylines from \"Teacher's Pest\", \"The Polish Boy\", \"The Gold Bug\", \"Ender's Shadow\", \"Shadow of the Hegemon\", \"Shadow of the Giant\", \"Shadows in Flight\", \"Earth Unaware\", and \"Speaker for the Dead\", and gives new insight into the beginnings of Ender's philotic connection with the Hive Queen. \"Ender's Game Alive\" is directed by Gabrielle de Cuir, produced by Stefan Rudnicki at Skyboat Media, published by Audible.com, and performed by a cast of over 30 voice actors playing over 100 roles.\nAudible also commissioned a German-language adaptation of the same script. Titled \"Ender's Game/Das grosse Spiel - Das ungek\u00fcrzte H\u00f6rspiel\" (\"The unabridged audio drama\"), this adaptation was produced by \"Lauscherlounge\", directed by Balthasar von Weymarn and performed by a cast of 100 different voice actors including children.\nTranslations.\n\"Ender's Game\" has been translated into 34 languages:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The museum documents the history of rock music and the artists, producers, engineers, and other personnel who have influenced its development.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Ahmet Ertegun, founder and chairman of Atlantic Records. After a long search for the right city, Cleveland was chosen in 1986 as the Hall of Fame's permanent home. Architect I. M. Pei designed the new museum, and it was dedicated on September 1, 1995.\nFoundation.\nThe RRHOF Foundation was established in 1983 by Ahmet Ertegun, who assembled a team that included publisher of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine Jann Wenner, record executives Seymour Stein, Bob Krasnow, and Noreen Woods, and attorneys Allen Grubman and Suzan Evans. \nThe Foundation began inducting artists in 1986, but the Hall of Fame still had no home. The search committee considered several cities, including Philadelphia (home to rock pioneer Bill Haley and \"American Bandstand\"); Memphis, Tennessee (home of Sun Studios and Stax Records); Detroit (home of Motown Records); Cincinnati, Ohio (home of King Records); New York City; and Cleveland.\nCleveland lobbied for the museum, with civic leaders in Cleveland pledging $65 million in public money to fund the construction, and citing that WJW disc jockey Alan Freed both coined the term \"rock and roll\" and heavily promoted the new genre, and that Cleveland was the location of Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball, which is often credited as the first major rock and roll concert. Freed was also a member of the hall of fame's inaugural class of inductees in 1986. In addition, Cleveland cited radio station WMMS, which played a key role in breaking several major acts in the U.S. during the 1970s and 1980s, including David Bowie, who began his first U.S. tour in the city, Bruce Springsteen, Roxy Music, and Rush, among many others.\nDuring early discussions on where to build the Hall of Fame and Museum, the Foundation's board considered a site along the Cuyahoga River in downtown Cleveland. Ultimately, the chosen location was along East Ninth Street in downtown by Lake Erie, east of Cleveland Stadium. At one point in the planning phase, when a financing gap existed, planners proposed locating the Rock Hall in the then-vacant May Company Building but finally decided to commission architect I. M. Pei to design a new building. Initial CEO Larry R. Thompson facilitated I. M. Pei in designs for the site. Pei came up with the idea of a tower with a glass pyramid protruding from it. Pei initially planned the tower to be high, but was forced to reduce it to due to the structure's proximity to Burke Lakefront Airport. The building's base is approximately .\nBuilding.\nThe groundbreaking ceremony for the building took place on June 7, 1993, with Pete Townshend, Chuck Berry, and Billy Joel in attendance.\nThe museum was dedicated on September 1, 1995, with the ribbon being cut by an ensemble that included Yoko Ono and Little Richard, before a crowd of more than 10,000 people. The following night, an all-star concert was held at Cleveland Stadium and featured Chuck Berry, Bob Dylan, Al Green, Jerry Lee Lewis, Aretha Franklin, Bruce Springsteen, Iggy Pop, John Fogerty, John Mellencamp, and many others.\nIn addition to the Hall of Fame inductees, the museum documents the entire history of rock and roll, regardless of induction status. Hall of Fame inductees are honored in a special exhibit located in a wing that juts out over Lake Erie. The exhibit space and inaugural exhibits were designed by Bruce Burdick's San Francisco design firm The Burdick Group.\nSince 1986, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has selected new inductees. The formal induction ceremony has been held in New York City 28 times (1986\u20131992, 1994\u20131996, 1998\u20132008, 2010\u20132011, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2023); four times in Los Angeles (1993, 2013, 2022, and 2025); and seven times in the hall of fame's home in Cleveland (1997, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018, 2021, and 2024).\nThe 2009 and 2012 induction weeks were made possible by a public\u2013private partnership between the City of Cleveland; the State of Ohio; the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; and local foundations, corporations, civic organizations, and individuals. Collectively, these entities invested $5.8 million in 2009 and $7.9 million in 2012 to produce a week of events, including free concerts, a gospel celebration, exhibition openings, free admission to the museum, and induction ceremonies at Public Hall.\nMillions viewed the television broadcast of the Cleveland inductions, and tens of thousands traveled to Ohio during induction week to participate in the events. The economic impact of the 2009 induction week activities was more than $13 million, and it provided an additional $20 million in media exposure for the region. The 2012 induction week yielded similar results.\nIn 2020, the Rock Hall announced plans to renovate and expand its footprint by a third. The architecture firm PAU, founded by Vishaan Chakrabarti, will lead the project.\nLayout.\nThe building contains seven levels. On the lower level is the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall, the museum's main gallery, which includes exhibits on the roots of rock and roll (gospel, blues, rhythm &amp; blues and folk, country, and bluegrass). It also features exhibits on cities that have had a major impact on rock and roll: Memphis, Detroit, London, Liverpool, San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle. There are exhibits about soul music, the Fifties, Sun Records, hip hop music, Cleveland's rock and roll legacy, the music of the Midwest, rock and roll radio and dee-jays, and the many protests against rock and roll. This gallery also has exhibits that focus on individual artists, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and others. Finally, the Ahmet M. Ertegun Exhibition Hall includes a theatre that features films on various subjects such as American Bandstand.\nThe first floor of the museum is the entrance level. It includes a caf\u00e9, a stage that the museum uses for various special performances and events throughout the year, and a section called \"Backstage Stories\". The second floor includes several interactive kiosks that feature programs on one-hit wonders and the Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll. This level also includes a gallery with artifact-filled exhibits about Les Paul, Alan Freed, Sam Phillips, and the evolution of audio technology.\nVisitors enter the Hall of Fame section of the museum on the third floor. This section includes \"The Power of Rock Experience\", which includes one of Jonathan Demme's final works, a film shown in the Connor Theater. The film includes musical highlights from some of the Hall's induction ceremonies. Visitors exit the Hall of Fame section on the fourth floor. That level features the Foster Theater, a state-of-the-art 3-D theater that is used for special events and programs.\nFinally, the top two levels of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame feature large, temporary exhibits. Over the years, numerous exhibits have been installed on these two levels, including exhibits about Elvis Presley, hip-hop, the Supremes, the Who, U2, John Lennon, the Clash, the Grateful Dead, Bruce Springsteen, \"Women Who Rock\", and the Rolling Stones.\nArchitecture.\nDesigned by I. M. Pei and structurally engineered by Leslie E. Robertson Associates, the building rises above the shores of Lake Erie. It is a combination of geometric forms and cantilevered spaces that are anchored by a 162-foot tower. The tower supports a dual-triangular-shaped glass \"tent\" that extends (at its base) onto a 65,000-square-foot plaza that provides a main entry facade.\nThe building houses more than 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, as well as administrative offices, a store, and a caf\u00e9.\n\"In designing this building,\" Pei said, \"it was my intention to echo the energy of rock and roll. I have consciously used an architectural vocabulary that is bold and new, and I hope the building will become a dramatic landmark for the city of Cleveland and for fans of rock and roll around the world.\"\nNew York City Annex.\nIn 2006, the RRHOF partnered with three entertainment production companies to create a branch museum in New York City. On November 18, 2008, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Annex NYC opened in Manhattan's SoHo district. Located at 76 Mercer Street just west of Broadway, the Annex occupied an underground space of . The branch museum operated in much the same way as its Cleveland parent, featuring archetypal display pieces like Prince's coat from \"Purple Rain\", David Byrne's \"big suit\" from \"Stop Making Sense\", and Elvis Presley's motorcycle jacket and Bible. But from its start, the Annex also had a distinct New York area focus that made plenty of space for big items like the phone booth from CBGB, layered thick with band stickers over the decades; Bruce Springsteen's own 1957 Chevrolet; a special gallery reserved for the city's musicians; and an intricate scale model of Manhattan highlighting sites of rock history.\nJann Wenner served as chairman of the board of the Annex. At its opening night gala, he inadvertently created a controversy after he told a reporter, \"One of the small sad things is we didn't do it in New York in the first place.\" He later expressed regret for his remark, which he said had been misconstrued and clarified that \"I am absolutely delighted that the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is in Cleveland.\"\nThe Annex closed on January 3, 2010, its quick demise reportedly due to the 2008 financial crisis and a subsequent downturn in the city's tourism. The museum's final major exhibition was about John Lennon and his years in New York City.\nExhibits and features.\nSince 1997, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame has featured numerous temporary exhibits that range in size from major exhibits that fill the top two floors of the museum to smaller exhibits that are often installed in the main exhibition hall on the lower level.\nThe museum's first major exhibit opened on May 10, 1997. It was called \"I Want to Take You Higher: The Psychedelic Era, 1965\u20131969\" and included memorabilia from numerous artists including John Lennon, Eric Clapton, John Sebastian, Jefferson Airplane, and Janis Joplin, as well as items related to the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival and 1969's Woodstock.\nThat exhibit was followed by \"Elvis Is in the Building\", which ran from August 8, 1998, to September 5, 1999. This year-long tribute was the first exhibit devoted to a single artist: Elvis Presley, the \"King of Rock and Roll\" and the first inductee into the RRHOF in 1986. Graceland supplied a significant selection of representative artifacts for this special tribute that spanned Presley's life and career. Next, the museum curated \"Roots, Rhymes and Rage: The Hip-Hop Story\", which was the first major museum exhibit to focus on hip-hop. It ran from November 11, 1999, to August 6, 2000. It was followed by \"Rock Style\", an exhibit that focused on both rock and roll and fashion. It featured clothing from Buddy Holly to Alice Cooper, Ray Charles to David Bowie, and Smokey Robinson to Sly Stone. After it closed in Cleveland, \"Rock Style\" traveled to other museums in the U.S.\nOther temporary exhibits have included \"Lennon: His Life and Work\", which ran from October 20, 2000, to January 1, 2003, followed by \"In the Name of Love: Two Decades of U2\" and \"Reflections: The Mary Wilson Supreme Legacy Collection\". A major exhibition titled \"Louder than Words: Rock, Power, Politics\" was on display during the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\nOther large temporary exhibits have focused on the Clash (\"Revolution Rock: The Story of the Clash\"), the Doors (\"Break on Through: The Lasting Legacy of the Doors\"), the Who's \"Tommy\" (\"Tommy: The Amazing Journey\"), and Bruce Springsteen (\"From Asbury Park to the Promised Land: The Life and Music of Bruce Springsteen\"). Another thematic temporary exhibit focused on the role of women in rock and roll (\"Women Who Rock: Vision, Passion, Power\"). Many of these exhibits travel to other museums after closing in Cleveland. A major temporary exhibit in 2017 told the story and impact of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame also curates many smaller temporary exhibits. Over the years, these exhibits have focused on such topics as the Vans Warped Tour, the Concert for Bangladesh, Woodstock's 40th and 50th anniversaries, Austin City Limits, the Monterey International Pop Festival, Roy Orbison, Motown's 50th anniversary, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Marty Stuart, Paul Simon, Graham Nash, John Mellencamp, and Geddy Lee's basses.\nThe museum also devotes exhibits to photography and artwork related to rock and roll. Among the photographers whose work has been featured at the Hall of Fame are George Kalinsky, Alfred Wertheimer, Tommy Edwards, Kevin Mazur, Janet Macoska, Lynn Goldsmith, Linda McCartney, Mike McCartney, Robert Alford, and George Shuba. The museum also featured the artwork of Philip Burke in one of its temporary exhibits, and a later exhibit featured Herb Ritts.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum produces numerous public programs, including concerts, interviews, lectures, film screenings, and other events that help tell the story of rock and roll.\nEvery February, the museum celebrates Black History Month by hosting concerts, film screenings, and lectures that illustrate the important role African-Americans have played in the history of rock and roll. \nAnother program is the Hall of Fame Series. This series began in April 1996 and features interviews with Hall of Fame inductees in rare and intimate settings, most often in the Museum's Foster Theater. The interviews are usually followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience and, often, a performance by the inductee. \nA similar program is the Legends Series, whose only real difference from the Hall of Fame Series program is that it features artists who have not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame. Peter Hook of Joy Division, Spinderella of Salt n Pepa, Tommy James, and the Chi-Lites are among the artists who have participated in the Legends Series.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's most acclaimed program is the annual American Music Masters series. Each year, the museum celebrates one of the Hall's inductees with a week-long series of programs that includes interviews, film screenings, and, often, a special exhibit. The celebration ends with an all-star concert held at a Cleveland theater. The concerts include a diverse mix of artists\u2014from Hall of Fame inductees to contemporary musicians.\nThe American Music Masters series began in 1996 with \"Hard Travelin': The Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger\". Since then, the programs have honored the following inductees: Jimmie Rodgers (1997), Robert Johnson (1998), Louis Jordan (1999), Muddy Waters (2000), Bessie Smith (2001), Hank Williams (2002), Buddy Holly (2003), Lead Belly (2004), Sam Cooke (2005), Roy Orbison (2006), Jerry Lee Lewis (2007), Les Paul (2008), Janis Joplin (2009), Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew (2010), Aretha Franklin (2011), Chuck Berry (2012), The Everly Brothers (2014), and Johnny Cash (2017). In 2019, the concert series's format was retooled, and the event was renamed the Rock Hall Honors, in which the honored performer is joined in concert by guests of their choice. The first Rock Hall Honors concert, featuring Mavis Staples, was performed in Cleveland in September 2019.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame won the 2020 Webby People's Voice Award for Cultural Institution in the category Web.\nList of \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\".\nHall of Fame museum curator James Henke, along with \"the museum's curatorial staff and numerous rock critics and music experts\", created an unordered list of \"500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The list is part of a permanent exhibit at the museum, and was envisioned as part of the museum from its opening in 1995. It contains songs recorded from the 1920s through the 1990s. The oldest song on the list is \"Wabash Cannonball\" (in particular Roy Acuff's 1936 version), written c.\u20091882 and credited to J. A. Roff. Since then, however, an additional 160 songs have been added, and the list is now simply referred to as \"The Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\". The most recent songs on the list are Gnarls Barkley's \"Crazy\" and My Chemical Romance's \"Welcome to the Black Parade\", which were both released in 2006. The Beatles and the Rolling Stones are the most represented on the 660-song list, with eight songs each.\n25th anniversary concert.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame celebrated its 25th anniversary with a concert series over two days on October 29 and 30, 2009, at Madison Square Garden in New York. The celebration included performances by Jerry Lee Lewis, U2, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Dion DiMucci, Metallica, James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Fergie, Mick Jagger, Lou Reed, Ray Davies, Ozzy Osbourne, Paul Simon, Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Sting, Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials, and Crosby, Stills and Nash. The first night ran almost six hours, with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band closing the concert with special guests John Fogerty, Darlene Love, Tom Morello, Sam Moore, Jackson Browne, Peter Wolf, and Billy Joel.\nInductees.\nArtists are inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at an annual induction ceremony. Over the years, the majority of the ceremonies have been held at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. However, on January 12, 1993, the ceremony was held in Los Angeles and was held there again in 2013. On May 6, 1997, about a year and a half after the opening of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, the ceremony was held in Cleveland. It returned to Cleveland in 2009 and again in 2012. Current plans call for the ceremony to be in Cleveland every three years.\nGenerally, the number of inductees each year ranges from about a half-dozen to a dozen. Virtually all living inductees have attended the ceremonies, and they are usually presented with their Hall of Fame award by an artist who was influenced by that inductee's music. Both the presenter and the inductee speak at the ceremonies, which also include numerous musical performances by both the inductees and the presenters. As of \u00a02021[ [update]], there were 338 inductees.\nThe first group of inductees, inducted on January 23, 1986, included Elvis Presley, James Brown, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Ray Charles, Chuck Berry, Sam Cooke, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly, and Jerry Lee Lewis. Robert Johnson, Jimmie Rodgers, and Jimmy Yancey were inducted as Early Influences; John Hammond received the Lifetime Achievement Award; and Alan Freed and Sam Phillips were inducted as Non-Performers.\nPerformers.\nA nominating committee composed of rock and roll historians selects names for the \"Performers\" category (singers, vocal groups, bands, and instrumentalists of all kinds), which are then voted on by roughly 500 experts across the world. Those selected to vote include academics, journalists, producers, and others with music industry experience. Artists become eligible for induction 25 years after the release of their first record. Criteria include the influence and significance of the artists' contributions to the development and perpetuation of rock and roll. Block approval voting is used, with those nominees who receive the most votes being inducted, subject to a minimum of 50% approval. Around five to seven performers are inducted each year.\nIn 2012, six additional groups\u2014the Miracles, the Famous Flames, the Comets, the Blue Caps, the Midnighters, and the Crickets\u2014were inducted as performers by a special committee due to the controversial exclusions when their lead singer was inducted. \"There was a lot of discussion about this,\" said Terry Stewart, a member of the nominating committee. \"There had always been conversations about why the groups weren't included when the lead singers were inducted. Very honestly, nobody could really answer that question \u2013 it was so long ago ... We decided we'd sit down as an organization and look at that. This is the result.\"\nEarly Influences.\nEarly Influences includes artists from earlier eras\u2014primarily country, folk, jazz, and blues\u2014whose music inspired and influenced rock and roll artists. Other notable artists that have been inducted as Early Influences include Bill Kenny &amp; The Ink Spots, country musicians Jimmie Rodgers and Hank Williams, blues musician Howlin' Wolf, and jazz musicians Jelly Roll Morton and Louis Armstrong. After Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday in 2000, no one was inducted in this category until 2009, when rockabilly singer Wanda Jackson was selected. Unlike earlier inductees in this category, Jackson's career almost entirely took place after the traditional 1955 start of the \"rock era\".\nAhmet Ertegun Award for Lifetime Achievement.\nFormerly the \"Non-Performers\" award, this category encompasses those who primarily work behind the scenes in the music industry, including record label executives, songwriters, record producers, disc jockeys, concert promoters, and music journalists. Following the death of the Hall of Fame's co-founder Ahmet Ertegun, this award was renamed in his honor in 2008.\nAward for Musical Excellence.\nFormerly the \"Sidemen\" award, this category was introduced in 2000 and honors veteran session and concert players who are selected by a committee composed primarily of producers. The category was dormant from 2004 through 2007 and re-activated in 2008. This honor was renamed the \"Award for Musical Excellence\" in 2010. According to Joel Peresman, the president of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, \"This award gives us flexibility to dive into some things and recognize some people who might not ordinarily get recognized.\"\nLibrary and archives.\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum's Library and Archives is the world's most comprehensive repository of materials related to the history of rock and roll. The library and archives are located in a new building on the Metro Campus of Cuyahoga Community College in Cleveland's Campus District.\nThe library and archives' mission is to collect, preserve, and provide access to these materials. The library and archives operates on two levels: people may come into the library to read books and magazines, listen to music and other recordings, and watch videos and films. More serious scholars, historians, and journalists may also make an appointment for access to the archival collections under the supervision of the staff archivists.\nThe library is composed of books, academic dissertations, and other references. It also includes popular magazines, scholarly journals, and trade publications; commercial audio and video recordings; and research databases.\nThe archival collections include music-business records from record executives, artist managers, labels, historic venues, recording studios, specialists in stage design and lighting, and long-running concert tours. The collections also contain important individual items, such as personal letters penned by Aretha Franklin and Madonna, handwritten working lyrics by Jimi Hendrix and LL Cool J, papers from music journalists such as Sue Cassidy Clark, and rare concert recordings from CBGB in the 1970s.\nCriticism and controversy.\nA frequent criticism of the hall of fame is that the nomination process is controlled by a small number of individuals who are not themselves musicians, such as founders Jann Wenner and Suzan Evans, and writer Dave Marsh, reflecting their personal tastes rather than public opinion as a whole. A former member of the nominations board once commented that \"at one point Suzan Evans lamented the choices being made because there weren't enough big names that would sell tickets to the dinner. That was quickly remedied by dropping one of the doo-wop groups being considered in favor of a 'name' artist ... I saw how certain pioneering artists of the '50s and early '60s were shunned because there needed to be more name power on the list, resulting in '70s superstars getting in before the people who made it possible for them. Some of those pioneers still aren't in today.\" Sister Rosetta Tharpe is often regarded as the godmother of rock and roll, but was not chosen for induction until 2017. Velvet Underground drummer Maureen Tucker has dismissed the hall of fame as the \"Hall of Lame\" despite the band being inducted a few years prior to the remark.\nThere was also criticism of the opacity in the selection process. Janet Morrissey of \"The New York Times\" wrote:\nWith fame and money at stake, it's no surprise that a lot of backstage lobbying goes on. Why any particular act is chosen in any particular year is a mystery to performers as well as outsiders, and committee members say they want to keep it that way.\nThe chairman of the nominating committee, Jon Landau, confirmed: \"We've done a good job of keeping the proceedings nontransparent. It all dies in the room.\"\nAccording to Fox News, petitions with tens of thousands of signatures have also been ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all. The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres. According to author Brett Milano in 2007, \"entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and a whole lot of black music\". At the time of Milano's comment, Pink Floyd were the only progressive rock band in the hall, although bands such as Genesis, Rush, Yes, and the Moody Blues have since been inducted. In 2022, Steven Hyden, a music critic for \"Uproxx\" and a hall voter, wrote that he believed the hall had been ignoring alternative rock and indie rock artists. Hyden said that none of the 13 influential American bands from the 1980s profiled in Michael Azerrad's 2001 book \"Our Band Could Be Your Life\" had been inducted, and wrote \"How in the hell can you tell the story of rock 'n' roll without including a single one of them?\" \nSome critics have pointed out a bias in favor of American and British acts, while Canadian rock bands, such as the Guess Who, are often ignored, with Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Leonard Cohen, Rush, and the Band being the only Canadian acts in the hall. Mexican journalist Miguel G\u00e1lvez noted that no artist that performed exclusively in Spanish had ever been inducted into the hall, and advocated for the induction of artists from Latin America, including the Argentine rock band Soda Stereo.\nAnother criticism is that too many artists are inducted. In one fifteen-year span, ninety-seven artists were inducted, averaging between six and seven inductees per year. A minimum of 50% of the vote is needed to be inducted, although the final percentages are not announced and a certain number of inductees (five in 2011) is set before the ballots are shipped. The committee usually nominates a small number of artists (twelve in 2010) from an increasing number of different genres. Several voters, including Joel Selvin, himself a former member of the nominating committee, did not submit their ballots in 2007 because they did not feel that any of the candidates were truly worthy.\nMembers of the British punk rock band the Sex Pistols, inducted in 2006, refused to attend the ceremony, calling the museum \"a piss stain\" and \"urine in wine\". In 2018, when British rock band Dire Straits were inducted, bandleader Mark Knopfler did not attend the ceremony and offered no official explanation, leaving bassist John Illsley to say: \"He just didn't feel like coming, it's as simple as that. It just didn't appeal to him, and I appealed to him on several occasions.\" In response to Oasis' nomination for the Class of 2024, Liam Gallagher disparaged the hall on X, declaring that \"there's something very fishy about those awards\", \"it's all a load of bollox [\"sic\"]\", and referring to its members as \"bumbaclarts\".\nIn BBC Radio 6 Music's Annual John Peel Lecture in 2013, singer Charlotte Church accused the museum of gender bias, stating, \"Out of 295 acts and artists in the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame, 259 are entirely male, meaning that Tina Weymouth's part in Talking Heads makes them one of the 36 female acts.\" In 2014, the percentage of female inductees was 8.5%. Courtney Love made similar criticisms of the hall in 2023, highlighting the length of time it had taken to induct artists such as Kate Bush, Nina Simone, Carole King, Linda Ronstadt, and \"most egregiously\", Tina Turner as a solo artist, as well as the failure to induct Chaka Khan despite seven nominations. Following Donna Summer's death in 2012, Elton John had criticized the hall for failing to induct her during her lifetime, calling it \"a total disgrace, especially when I see the second-rate talent that has been inducted.\"\nSteve Miller, a 2016 inductee, directed a litany of complaints at the hall, both during his induction speech and especially in interviews after it. His criticisms included that there is a general lack of female inductees, there is not enough support by the hall for music education, and inductees are treated poorly at the award ceremony. At the same ceremony, Cheap Trick guitarist Rick Nielsen commented on the hall's ticket policy for inductees and their families as unnecessarily expensive, a sentiment echoed by Miller.\nIn 2018, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden called the hall \"an utter and complete load of bollocks ... run by a bunch of sanctimonious bloody Americans who wouldn't know rock 'n' roll if it hit them in the face\". Dickinson has also expressed an overall distaste for the hall's entity, arguing that \"if you put [music] in a museum, then it's dead\". Iron Maiden had been eligible for induction since 2004. Hard rock and heavy metal website \"Blabbermouth.net\" observed how it had taken 15 years for Kiss to be inducted (eligible since 1999; inducted in 2014) and 23 years for Deep Purple (eligible since 1993; inducted in 2016). Regarding his band's non-induction into the hall, Judas Priest bassist Ian Hill stated in a 2019 interview, \"I don't think they like heavy metal music in general.\"\nFans of the Dave Matthews Band criticized the 2020 inductions because the band was not part of the class, despite them topping the fan vote. The band was inducted in 2024.\nThe Dave Clark Five.\nOn March 14, 2007, two days after that year's induction ceremony, Roger Friedman of Fox News published an article that claimed the Dave Clark Five should have been the fifth inductee, as they had more votes than inductee Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. The article went on to say that Jann Wenner availed himself of a technicality on the day votes were due in. In reality, the Dave Clark Five received six more votes than Grandmaster Flash, but Wenner thought \"we couldn't go another year without a rap act\".\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation responded: \"There is a format and rules and procedure. There is a specific time when the votes have to be in, and then they are counted. The bands with the top five votes got in.\" The Dave Clark Five were subsequently nominated again and then inducted the following year.\nThe Monkees.\nIn a Facebook post, Monkees member Michael Nesmith stated that he did not know if the Monkees belonged in the Hall of Fame because he could see the impact of the Monkees only from the inside and went on to say: \"I can see the HOF (Hall of Fame) is a private enterprise. It seems to operate as a business, and the inductees are there by some action of the owners of the Enterprise. The inductees appear to be chosen at the owner's pleasure. This seems proper to me. It is their business in any case. It does not seem to me that the HOF carries a public mandate, nor should it be compelled to conform to one.\"\nSome magazines and news outlets\u2014such as \"Time\", NPR radio, \"The Christian Science Monitor\", \"Goldmine\" magazine, Yahoo! Music, and MSNBC\u2014have argued that the Monkees belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nDolly Parton.\nCountry singer-songwriter Dolly Parton was announced as a nominee for the 2022 Hall of Fame ballot in February 2022. Parton requested to be removed from the ballot in March 2022, after the ballots had been sent to voters. In a statement, Parton wrote: \"Even though I am extremely flattered and grateful to be nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, I don't feel that I have earned that right. I really do not want votes to be split because of me, so I must respectfully bow out.\" The hall replied days later that she would remain on the ballot, in part because the ballots for the 2022 class had already been sent to voters. \nAlthough Parton had asked to be removed from the ballot because she did not think of herself as a rock artist, the hall responded that \"From its inception, rock and roll has had deep roots in rhythm &amp; blues and country music. It is not defined by any one genre, rather a sound that moves youth culture. Dolly Parton's music impacted a generation of young fans and influenced countless artists that followed. Her nomination to be considered for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame followed the same process as all other artists who have been considered.\" In April 2022, Parton told \"Morning Edition\" that she would accept her induction if she were selected. Parton was announced as a 2022 inductee on May 4.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58903", "revid": "34669967", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58903", "title": "Cloud forest", "text": "Type of rainforest\nA cloud forest, also called a water forest, primas forest, or tropical montane cloud forest, is a generally tropical or subtropical, evergreen, montane, moist forest characterized by a persistent, frequent or seasonal low-level cloud cover, usually at the canopy level, formally described in the \"International Cloud Atlas\" (2017) as silvagenitus. Cloud forests often exhibit an abundance of mosses covering the ground and vegetation, in which case they are also referred to as mossy forests. Mossy forests usually develop on the saddles of mountains, where moisture introduced by settling clouds is more effectively retained.\nCloud forests are among the most biodiversity-rich biomes in the world, with a large number of species directly or indirectly depending on them.\nOther moss forests include black spruce/feathermoss climax forest, with a moderately dense canopy and a forest floor of feathermosses, including \"Hylocomium splendens\", \"Pleurozium schreberi\", and \"Ptilium crista-castrensis\". These weft-form mosses grow in boreal moss forests.\nClimate.\nThe presence of cloud forests is dependent on local climate (which is affected by the distance to the sea), the exposition and the latitude (typically from 25\u00b0N to 25\u00b0S), and the elevation (which varies from 500 m to 4000 m above sea level). Typically, there is a relatively small band of elevation in which the atmospheric environment is suitable for cloud forest development. This is characterized by persistent fog at the vegetation level, resulting in the reduction of direct sunlight and thus of evapotranspiration. Within cloud forests, much of the moisture available to plants arrives in the form of fog drip, where fog condenses on tree leaves and then drips onto the ground below.\nAnnual rainfall can range from 500 to 10,000\u00a0mm/year and mean temperature between 8 and 20 \u00b0C (46.4 and 68\u00a0\u00b0F).\nWhile cloud forest today is the most widely used term, in some regions, these ecosystems or special types of cloud forests are called mossy forest, elfin forest, montane thicket, and dwarf cloud forest.\nThe definition of cloud forest can be ambiguous, with many countries not using the term (preferring such terms as Afromontane forest, upper montane rain forest, montane laurel forest, or more localised terms such as the Bolivian \"yungas\", and the \"laurisilva\" of the Atlantic Islands). Sometimes subtropical and temperate forests in which similar meteorological conditions occur are considered to be cloud forests.\nCharacteristics.\nIn comparison with lower-altitude tropical moist forests, cloud forests show a reduced tree stature combined with increased stem density and generally, a lower diversity of woody plants. Trees in these regions are generally shorter and more heavily stemmed than in lower-altitude forests in the same regions, often with gnarled trunks and branches, forming dense, compact crowns. Their leaves become smaller, thicker and harder with increasing altitude. The high moisture promotes the development of a high biomass and biodiversity of epiphyte, particularly bryophytes, lichens, ferns (including filmy ferns), bromeliads and orchids. The number of endemic plants can be very high.\nAn important feature of cloud forests is the tree crowns that intercept the wind-driven cloud moisture, part of which drips to the ground. This fog drip occurs when water droplets from the fog adhere to the needles or leaves of trees or other objects, coalesce into larger drops and then drop to the ground. It can be an important contribution to the hydrologic cycle.\nCloud forests are often peatlands, showcasing many classic peatland attributes. Due to the high water content of the soil, the reduced solar radiation and the low rates of decomposition and mineralization, the soil acidity is very high, with more humus and peat often forming the upper soil layer.\nStadtm\u00fcller (1987) distinguishes two general types of tropical montane cloud forests:\nDistribution of tropical montane cloud forests.\nOnly 1% of the global woodland consists of cloud forests. They were estimated to be 11% of all tropical forests in the 1970s. A total of around 736 cloud forest sites have been identified in 59 countries by the World Conservation Monitoring Centre, with 327 of them legally protected areas as of 2002. Important areas of cloud forest are in Central and South America (mainly Costa Rica, Venezuela, Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Ecuador, and Colombia), East and Central Africa, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Hawaii, Papua New Guinea, and in the Caribbean.\nThe 1997 version of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre's database of cloud forests found a total of 605 tropical montane cloud forest sites in 41 countries. 280 sites, or 46% of the total, were located in Latin America, known in biogeography as the Neotropical realm. Twelve countries had tropical montane cloud forest sites, with the majority in Venezuela (64 sites), Mexico (64), Ecuador (35) and Colombia (28). Southeast Asia and Australasia had 228 sites in 14 countries \u2013 66 in Indonesia, 54 in Malaysia, 33 in Sri Lanka, 32 in the Philippines, and 28 in Papua New Guinea. 97 sites were recorded in 21 African countries, mostly scattered on isolated mountains. Of the 605 sites, 264 were in protected areas.\nConservation status.\nCloud forests occupied 0.4% of the global land surface in 2001 and harboured ~3,700 species of birds, mammal, amphibians and tree ferns (~15% of the global diversity of those groups), with half of those species entirely restricted to cloud forests. Worldwide, ~2.4% of cloud forests (in some regions, more than 8%) were lost between 2001 and 2018, especially in readily accessible places. While protected areas have slowed this decline, a large proportion of loss in TCF cover is still occurring despite formal protection. \nTemperate cloud forests.\nAlthough far from being universally accepted as true cloud forests, several forests in temperate regions have strong similarities with tropical cloud forests. The term is further confused by occasional reference to cloud forests in tropical countries as \"temperate\" due to the cooler climate associated with these misty forests.\nCurrent situation.\nIn 1970, the original extent of cloud forests on the Earth was around 50 million hectares. Population growth, poverty and uncontrolled land use have contributed to the loss of cloud forests. The 1990 Global Forest Survey found that 1.1% of tropical mountain and highland forests were lost each year, which was higher than in any other tropical forests. In Colombia, one of the countries with the largest area of cloud forests, only 10\u201320% of the initial cloud forest cover remains. Significant areas have been converted to plantations, or for use in agriculture and pasture. Significant crops in montane forest zones include tea and coffee, and the logging of unique species causes changes to the forest structure.\nIn 2004, an estimated one-third of all cloud forests on the planet were protected at that time.\nImpact of climate change.\nBecause of their delicate dependency on local climates, cloud forests will be strongly affected by global climate change. Results show that the extent of environmentally suitable areas for cloud forest in Mexico will sharply decline in the next 70 years. A number of climate models suggest low-altitude cloudiness will be reduced, which means the optimum climate for many cloud forest habitats will increase in altitude. Linked to the reduction of cloud moisture immersion and increasing temperature, the hydrological cycle will change, so the system will dry out. This would lead to the wilting and the death of epiphytes, which rely on high humidity. Frogs and lizards are expected to suffer from increased drought. Calculations suggest the loss of cloud forest in Mexico would lead to extinction of up to 37 vertebrates specific to that region. In addition, climate changes can result in a higher number of hurricanes, which may increase damage to tropical montane cloud forests. All in all, the results of climate change will be a loss in biodiversity, altitude shifts in species ranges and community reshuffling, and, in some areas, complete loss of cloud forests.\nIn botanical gardens.\nCloud-forest conditions are hard and expensive to replicate in a glasshouse because it is necessary to maintain very high humidity. Day temperatures have to be between while night temperatures have to be maintained between . In most cases, sophisticated refrigeration equipment has to be used to provide night temperatures below . Such displays are usually quite small, but there are some notable exceptions. In the United States, the Atlanta Botanical Garden has a large tropical cloud forest greenhouse with a large collection of cloud forest epiphytes from around the world. It implements a refrigeration system to decrease the temperature at night. For many years, the Singapore Botanic Gardens had a so-called coolhouse. The Gardens by the Bay features a coolhouse that is simply named \"Cloud Forest\". The latter features a artificial mountain clad in epiphytes such as orchids, ferns, clubmosses, bromeliads and others. Due to a relatively mild climate and summer fog, the San Francisco Botanical Garden has three outdoor cloud forest collections, including a Mesoamerican Cloud Forest established in 1985. The Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens contains a \"Panama Cloud Forest\" garden in House 11.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The word is derived from Latin \"serpens\", a crawling animal or snake. Snakes have been associated with some of the oldest rituals known to humankind.\nThey represent dual expression of good and evil.\nThe historian of religions Mircea Eliade observed in \"The Myth of the Eternal Return\" that \"the serpent symbolizes chaos, the formless and nonmanifested\".\nIn \"The Symbolism of the Cross\", Traditionalist Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non contended that \"the serpent will depict the series of the cycles of universal manifestation\", \"the indefinitude of universal Existence,\" and \"the being's attachment to the indefinite series of cycles of manifestation.\"\nRecent academic book-length treatments of serpent symbolism include James H. Charlesworth's \"The Good and Evil Serpent\" (2010) and Charles William Dailey's \"The Serpent Symbol in Tradition\" (2022).\nAcross cultures, the serpent has been revered and feared as a symbol of duality, transformation, and the eternal cycle. In Hindu and Buddhist traditions, serpents appear as n\u0101gas\u2014guardians of treasures and waters\u2014and are linked to kundalini energy, the spiritual force coiled at the base of the spine. In Mesoamerican mythology, the feathered serpent Quetzalcoatl symbolizes renewal, wisdom, and the union of earth and sky. The African Vodun tradition reveres the rainbow serpent Dan as a cosmic balancer, while Aboriginal Australian mythology sees the Rainbow Serpent as a creator being central to Dreamtime stories.\nIn psychology, Carl Jung interpreted the serpent as an archetype of the unconscious and personal transformation.\nThe alchemical symbol of the ouroboros\u2014a serpent eating its own tail\u2014represents eternal return, unity of opposites, and the cyclic nature of the cosmos.\nThese representations reflect the serpent's enduring presence in religious, mystical, and philosophical thought as a symbol of power, rebirth, and the unknown.\nEvolutionary origins.\nThe anthropologist Lynne Isbell has argued that, as primates, the serpent as a symbol of death is built into our unconscious minds because of our evolutionary history. Isbell argues that for millions of years snakes were the only significant predators of primates, and that this explains why fear of snakes is one of the most common phobias worldwide and why the symbol of the serpent is so prevalent in world mythology; the serpent is an innate image of danger and death.\nFurthermore, the psychoanalyst Joseph Lewis Henderson and the ethnologist Maude Oakes have argued that the serpent is a symbol of initiation and rebirth precisely because it is a symbol of death.\nUsing phylogenetical and statistical methods on related motifs from folklore and myth, French comparativist Julien d'Huy managed to reconstruct a possible archaic narrative about the serpent. In this Paleolithic \"ophidian\" myth, snakes are connected to rains and storms, and even to water sources. In regards to the latter, it blocks rivers and other water sources in exchange for human sacrifices and/or material good offerings.\nValues.\nFertility and rebirth.\nHistorically, serpents and snakes represent fertility, health, or a creative life force. As snakes shed their skin through sloughing, they serve as symbols of rebirth, transformation, immortality, and healing. The ouroboros is a symbol of eternity and continual renewal of life. \nIn some Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire. According to some interpretations of the Midrash, the serpent represents sexual passion. In Hinduism, Kundalini is a dormant energy lying like a coiled serpent.\nThe Hopi people of North America performed an annual snake dance to celebrate the union of Snake Youth (a Sky spirit) and Snake Girl (an Underworld spirit) and to renew the fertility of Nature. During the dance, live snakes were handled, and at the end of the dance the snakes were released into the fields to guarantee good crops. \"The snake dance is a prayer to the spirits of the clouds, the thunder and the lightning, that the rain may fall on the growing crops.\" To the Hopi, snakes symbolized the umbilical cord, joining all humans to Mother Earth. \nGuardianship.\nSerpents are represented as potent guardians of temples and other sacred spaces. This connection may be grounded in the observation that when threatened, some snakes (such as rattlesnakes or cobras) frequently hold and defend their ground, first resorting to threatening display and then fighting, rather than retreat. Thus, they are natural guardians of treasures or sacred sites which cannot easily be moved out of harm's way.\nAt Angkor in Cambodia, numerous stone sculptures present hooded multi-headed n\u0101gas as guardians of temples or other premises. A favorite motif of Angkorean sculptors from approximately the 12th century\u00a0CE onward was that of the Buddha, sitting in the position of meditation, his weight supported by the coils of a multi-headed n\u0101ga that also uses its flared hood to shield him from above. This motif recalls the story of the Buddha and the serpent king Mucalinda: as the Buddha sat beneath a tree engrossed in meditation, Mucalinda came up from the roots of the tree to shield the Buddha from a tempest that was just beginning to arise.\nThe Gadsden flag of the American Revolution depicts a rattlesnake coiled up and poised to strike. Below the image of the snake is the legend, \"Don't tread on me.\" The snake symbolized the dangerousness of colonists willing to fight for their rights and homeland, and was also symbolic of their separation from Europe, as it was an animal unique to America. The motif is repeated in the First Navy Jack of the US Navy.\nVenom and medicine.\nSerpents are connected with venom and medicine. The snake's venom is associated with the chemicals of plants and fungi that have the power to either heal or provide expanded consciousness (and even the elixir of life and immortality) through divine intoxication. Because of its herbal knowledge and entheogenic association, the snake was often considered one of the wisest animals, being (semi-) divine. Its divine aspect combined with its habitat in the earth between the roots of plants made it an animal with chthonic properties connected to the afterlife and immortality. The deified Greek physician Asclepius, as god of medicine and healing, carried a staff with one serpent wrapped around it, which has become the symbol of modern medicine. Moses also had a replica of a serpent on a pole, the Nehushtan, mentioned in Numbers 21:8.\nAssociated animals.\nChthonic serpents and sacred trees.\nIn many myths, the chthonic serpent (sometimes a pair) lives in or is coiled around a Tree of Life situated in a divine garden. In the Genesis story of the Torah and biblical Old Testament, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is situated in the Garden of Eden together with the tree of life and the serpent. In Greek mythology, Ladon coiled around the tree in the garden of the Hesperides protecting the golden apples.\nSimilarly N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr (Nidhogg Nagar), the dragon of Norse mythology, eats from the roots of the Yggdrasil, the World Tree.\nUnder yet another tree (the Bodhi Tree of Enlightenment), the Buddha sat in ecstatic meditation. When a storm arose, the mighty serpent king Mucalinda rose up from his place beneath the earth and enveloped the Buddha in seven coils for seven days, so as not to break his ecstatic state.\nThe Vision Serpent was a symbol of rebirth in Maya mythology, with origins going back to earlier Maya conceptions, lying at the center of the world as the Mayans conceived it. \"It is in the center axis atop the World Tree. Essentially the World Tree and the Vision Serpent, representing the king, created the center axis which communicates between the spiritual and the earthly worlds or planes. It is through ritual that the king could bring the center axis into existence in the temples and create a doorway to the spiritual world, and with it power.\"\nSometimes the Tree of Life is represented (in a combination with similar concepts such as the World Tree and Axis mundi or \"World Axis\") by a staff such as those used by shamans. Examples of such staffs featuring coiled snakes in mythology are the caduceus of Hermes, the Rod of Asclepius, the Staff of Moses, and the papyrus reeds and deity poles entwined by a single serpent Wadjet, dating to earlier than \u00a0BCE. The oldest known representation of \"two\" snakes entwined around a rod is that of the Sumerian fertility god Ningizzida, who was sometimes depicted as a serpent with a human head, eventually becoming a god of healing and magic. It is the companion of Dumuzi (Tammuz), with whom it stood at the gate of heaven. In the Louvre, there is a famous green steatite vase carved for King Gudea of Lagash (dated variously to \u00a0BCE) with an inscription dedicated to Ningizzida. Ningizzida was the ancestor of Gilgamesh, who, according to the epic, dived to the bottom of the waters to retrieve the plant of life. But while he rested from his labor, a serpent came and ate the plant. The snake became immortal, and Gilgamesh was destined to die.\nNingizzida has been popularized in the 20th century by Raku Kei (Reiki, a.k.a. \"The Way of the Fire Dragon\"), where \"Nin Giz Zida\" is believed to be a fire serpent of Tibetan rather than Sumerian origin. \"Nin Giz Zida\" is another name for the ancient Hindu concept Kundalini, a Sanskrit word meaning either \"coiled up\" or \"coiling like a snake\". \"Kundalini\" refers to the mothering intelligence behind yogic awakening and spiritual maturation leading to altered states of consciousness. There are a number of other translations of the term, usually emphasizing a more serpentine nature to the word\u2014e.g. \"serpent power\". It has been suggested by Joseph Campbell that the symbol of snakes coiled around a staff is an ancient representation of Kundalini physiology. The staff represents the spinal column, with the snake(s) being energy channels. In the case of two coiled snakes, they usually cross each other seven times, a possible reference to the seven energy centers called chakras.\nIn Ancient Egypt, where the earliest written cultural records exist, the serpent appears from the beginning to the end of their mythology. Ra and Atum (\"he who completes or perfects\") became the same god, \"Atum\", the \"counter-Ra\", associated with earth animals, including the serpent: Nehebkau (\"he who harnesses the souls\") was the two-headed serpent deity who guarded the entrance to the underworld. He is often seen as the son of the snake goddess Renenutet. She often was confused with (and later was absorbed by) their primal snake goddess Wadjet, the Egyptian cobra, who from the earliest of records was the patron and protector of the country, all other deities, and the pharaohs. Hers is the first known oracle. She was depicted as the crown of Egypt, entwined around the staff of papyrus and the pole that indicated the status of all other deities, as well as having the all-seeing eye of wisdom and vengeance. She never lost her position in the Egyptian pantheon.\nThe image of the serpent as the embodiment of the wisdom transmitted by \"Sophia\" was an emblem used by gnosticism, especially those sects that the more orthodox characterized as \"Ophites\" (\"Serpent People\"). The chthonic serpent was one of the earth-animals associated with the cult of Mithras. The basilisk, the venomous \"king of serpents\" with the glance that kills, was hatched by a serpent, Pliny the Elder and others thought, from the egg of a cock.\nOutside Eurasia, in Yoruba mythology, Oshunmare was another mythic regenerating serpent.\nThe Rainbow Serpent (also known as the Rainbow Snake) is a major mythological being for Aboriginal people across Australia, although the creation myths associated with it are best known from northern Australia. In Fiji, Ratumaibulu was a serpent god who ruled the underworld and made fruit trees bloom. In the Northern Flinders Ranges reigns the Arkaroo, a serpent who drank Lake Frome empty, refuges into the mountains, carving valleys and waterholes, earthquakes through snoring.\nCosmic serpents.\nThe serpent, when forming a ring with its tail in its mouth, is a clear and widespread symbol of the \"All-in-All\", the totality of existence, infinity and the cyclic nature of the cosmos. The most well known version of this is the Aegypto-Greek ourobouros. It is believed to have been inspired by the Milky Way, as some ancient texts refer to a serpent of light residing in the heavens. The Ancient Egyptians associated it with Wadjet, one of their oldest deities, as well as another aspect, Hathor. In Norse mythology the World Serpent (or Midgard serpent) known as J\u00f6rmungandr encircled the world in the ocean's abyss biting its own tail.\nIn Hindu mythology Lord Vishnu is said to sleep while floating on the cosmic waters on the serpent Shesha. In the Puranas Shesha holds all the planets of the universe on his hoods and constantly sings the glories of Vishnu from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as \"Ananta-Shesha,\" which means \"Endless Shesha\". In the Samudra manthan chapter of the Puranas, Shesha loosens Mount Mandara for it to be used as a churning rod by the Asuras and Devas to churn the ocean of milk in the heavens in order to make Soma (or Amrita), the divine elixir of immortality. As a churning rope another giant serpent called Vasuki is used.\nIn pre-Columbian Central America Quetzalcoatl was sometimes depicted as biting its own tail. The mother of Quetzalcoatl was the Aztec goddess Coatlicue (\"the one with the skirt of serpents\"), also known as Cihuacoatl (\"The Lady of the serpent\"). Quetzalcoatl's father was Mixcoatl (\"Cloud Serpent\"). He was identified with the Milky Way, the stars, and the heavens in several Mesoamerican cultures.\nThe demigod Aidophedo of the West African Ashanti people is also a serpent biting its own tail. In Dahomey mythology of Benin in West Africa, the serpent that supports everything on its many coils was named Dan. In the Vodou of Benin and Haiti, Ayida-Weddo (a.k.a. Aida-Wedo, Aido Quedo, \"Rainbow-Serpent\") is a spirit of fertility, rainbows and snakes, and a companion or wife to Dan, the father of all spirits. As Vodou was exported to Haiti through the slave trade, Dan became Danballah, Damballah or Damballah-Wedo. Because of his association with snakes, he is sometimes disguised as Moses, who carried a snake on his staff. He is also thought by many to be the same entity of Saint Patrick, known as a snake banisher.\nThe serpent Hydra is a star constellation representing either the serpent thrown angrily into the sky by Apollo or the Lernaean Hydra as defeated by Heracles for one of his Twelve Labors. The constellation Serpens represents a snake being tamed by Ophiuchus the snake-handler, another constellation. The most probable interpretation is that Ophiuchus represents the healer Asclepius.\nDragons.\nOccasionally, serpents and dragons are used interchangeably, having similar symbolic functions. The venom of the serpent is thought to have a fiery quality similar to a fire-breathing dragon. The Greek Ladon and the Norse N\u00ed\u00f0h\u00f6ggr (Nidhogg Nagar) are sometimes described as serpents and sometimes as dragons. In Germanic mythology, \"serpent\" (Old English: \"wyrm\", Old High German: \"wurm\", Old Norse: \"ormr\") is used interchangeably with the Greek borrowing \"dragon\" (OE: \"draca\", OHG: \"trahho\", ON: \"dreki\"). In China and especially in Indochina, the Indian serpent n\u0101ga was equated with the \"l\u00f3ng\" or Chinese dragon. The Aztec and Toltec serpent god Quetzalcoatl also has dragon-like wings, like its equivalent in K'iche' Maya mythology Q'uq'umatz (\"feathered serpent\"), which had previously existed since Classic Maya times as the deity named Kukulkan.\nMythology and religion.\nAfrican mythology.\nIn Africa the chief centre of serpent worship was Dahomey, but the cult of the python seems to have been of exotic origin, dating back to the first quarter of the 17th century. By the conquest of Whydah the Dahomeyans were brought in contact with a people of serpent worshipers, and ended by adopting from them the beliefs which they at first despised. At Whydah, the chief centre, there is a serpent temple, tenanted by some fifty snakes. Every python of the \"danh-gbi\" kind must be treated with respect, and death is the penalty for killing one, even by accident. \"Danh-gbi\" has numerous wives, who until 1857 took part in a public procession from which the profane crowd was excluded; a python was carried round the town in a hammock, perhaps as a ceremony for the expulsion of evils.\nThe rainbow-god of the Ashanti was also conceived to have the form of a snake. His messenger was said to be a small variety of boa, but only certain individuals, not the whole species, were sacred.\nIn many parts of Africa the serpent is looked upon as the incarnation of deceased relatives. Among the amaZulu, as among the Betsileo of Madagascar, certain species are assigned as the abode of certain classes. The Maasai, on the other hand, regard each species as the habitat of a particular family of the tribe.\nAncient Near East.\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, Nirah, the messenger god of I\u0161taran, was represented as a serpent on \"kudurrus\", or boundary stones. Representations of two intertwined serpents are common in Sumerian art and Neo-Sumerian artwork and still appear sporadically on cylinder seals and amulets until as late as the thirteenth century\u00a0BCE. The horned viper (\"Cerastes cerastes\") appears in Kassite and Neo-Assyrian kudurrus and is invoked in Assyrian texts as a magical protective entity. A dragon-like creature with horns, the body and neck of a snake, the forelegs of a lion, and the hind-legs of a bird appears in Mesopotamian art from the Akkadian period until the Hellenistic period (323\u00a0BCE\u201331\u00a0BCE). This creature, known in Akkadian as the \"mu\u0161\u1e2bu\u0161\u0161u\", meaning \"furious serpent\", was used as a symbol for particular deities and also as a general protective emblem. It seems to have originally been the attendant of the underworld god Ninazu, but later became the attendant to the Hurrian storm-god Tishpak, as well as, later, Ninazu's son Ningishzida, the Babylonian national god Marduk, the scribal god Nabu, and the Assyrian national god Ashur.\nSnake cults were well established in Canaanite religion in the Bronze Age, for archaeologists have uncovered serpent cult objects in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at Megiddo, one at Gezer, one in the \"sanctum sanctorum\" of the Area H temple at Hazor, and two at Shechem.\nIn the surrounding region, serpent cult objects figured in other cultures. A late Bronze Age Hittite shrine in northern Syria contained a bronze statue of a god holding a serpent in one hand and a staff in the other. In 6th-century Babylon, a pair of bronze serpents flanked each of the four doorways of the temple of Esagila. At the Babylonian New Year's festival, the priest was to commission from a woodworker, a metalworker and a goldsmith two images, one of which \"shall hold in its left hand a snake of cedar, raising its right [hand] to the god Nabu\". At the tell of Tepe Gawra, at least seventeen Early Bronze Age Assyrian bronze serpents were recovered.\nBronze and Iron Age United Arab Emirates.\nSignificant finds of pottery, bronze-ware and even gold depictions of snakes have been made throughout the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The Bronze Age and Iron Age metallurgical centre of Saruq Al Hadid has yielded probably the richest trove of such objects, although finds have been made bearing snake symbols in Bronze Age sites at Rumailah, Bithnah and Masafi. Most of the depictions of snakes are similar, with a consistent dotted decoration applied to them.\nAlthough the widespread depiction of snakes in sites across the UAE is thought by archaeologists to have a religious purpose, this remains conjecture.\nAbrahamic Religions.\nJewish beliefs.\nIn the Hebrew Bible the serpent in the Garden of Eden lured Eve with the promise of being like God, tempting her that despite God's warning, death would not be the result, that God was withholding knowledge from her.\nThe staff of Moses transformed into a snake and then back into a staff (Exodus 4:2\u20134). The Book of Numbers 21:6\u20139 provides an origin for an archaic copper serpent, \"Nehushtan\", by associating it with Moses. This copper snake according to the Biblical text is put on a pole and used for healing. Book of Numbers 21:9 \"And Moses made a snake of copper, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a snake had bitten any man, when he beheld the snake of brass, he lived.\"\nWhen the reformer King Hezekiah came to the throne of Judah in the late 8th century\u00a0BCE, \"He removed the high places, broke the sacred pillars, smashed the idols, and broke into pieces the copper snake that Moses had made: for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and he called it Nehushtan. ()\nChristian beliefs.\nIn the Gospel of John 3:14\u201315, Jesus makes direct comparison between the raising up of the Son of Man and the act of Moses in raising up the serpent as a sign, using it as a symbol associated with salvation: \"As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life\".\nChristian Tradition also identifies Satan as a talking serpent in the Old Testament's Garden of Eden who had tempted Eve with a fruit from the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Eve, as well as her consort Adam, were then punished by YHWH for their disobedience to commandments outlined prior to this; had lifespan decreased, for women to suffer in birthing, as well as other torments.\nIslamic beliefs.\nThe serpent is a recurrent motif in Islamic thought, appearing in both sacred texts representing evil and works of art. The creature is often seen as a symbol of evil and punishment. The serpent is a complex figure in Islamic thought, appearing as both a symbol of evil and a figure of wisdom. Djinn, which are likewise figures of great potential mixed with danger, are also believed to appear in the form of snakes on occasion.\nThe Arabian Flying Snakes, also known as Arabhar, are a part of Arabian folklore and are said to live near the Arabian Sea. These snakes are believed to have the ability to fly, and their name \"Arabhar\" means \"Arab snake.\"\nThe Islamic serpent generally follows in the tradition of earlier Abrahamic myths as a symbol for the seductive draw of wisdom. This symbolism is reflected in various stories and parables, such as the tale of the snake-catcher and the serpent from Rumi, which uses the serpent as a symbol for the sensual soul within human beings. Another story from Arabian mythology features the giant serpent Falak, which is said to live below the fish known as Bahamut and is mentioned in the One Thousand and One Nights as a dangerous monster. It is said that Falak only fears God's greater power, which prevents it from consuming all of creation.\nAncient Iran.\nSerpents are sacred and powerful in the thought of prehistoric cultures of Iran, having been portrayed as patrons of fertility, water and wealth in the ancient objects of Iran. They seem to have been worshipped along with the fertility goddesses from the fourth to first millennia BC, when their presence as mighty patrons and source of life and of immortality is seen in the art of Tall-i Bakun, Chogha Mish, Tepe Sialk, Jiroft culture, Shahr-e Sukhteh, Shahdad, Elamite art, Luristan art, etc.\nHowever, it seems that the symbolic concept of the serpent was corrupted in the cultures of the Iranian plateau over time by Western influence. In Abrahamic traditions, the serpent represents sexual desire, as he lured Eve with the promise of forbidden knowledge in the Garden of Eden. As a result of such influence, Aryan religions call the serpents diabolic; Azhi Dahake in the Avesta is a scary serpent, and Zahhak in the \"Shahnameh\" is an infernal creature with two snakes on his shoulders. This replacement might be due to communication between the inhabitants of Iran and believers in Abrahamic religions, and beyond that the conversion of matriarchy into patriarchy as the social structure of Iranian plateau cultures.\nChinese mythology.\nIn Chinese creationism mythology, N\u00fcwa is the mother goddess who created humans from clay. She is depicted as a half snake being.\nGreek mythology.\nThe Minoan Snake Goddess brandished a serpent in either hand, perhaps evoking her role as source of wisdom, rather than her role as Mistress of the Animals (\"Potnia Theron\"), with a leopard under each arm.\nSerpents figured prominently in archaic Greek myths. According to some sources, Ophion (\"serpent\", a.k.a. Ophioneus), ruled the world with Eurynome before the two of them were cast down by Cronus and Rhea. The oracles of the Ancient Greeks were said to have been the continuation of the tradition begun with the worship of the Egyptian cobra goddess Wadjet.\nTyphon, the enemy of the Olympian gods, is described as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed dog with a snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.\nPython was the earth-dragon of Delphi. She always was represented in the vase-paintings and by sculptors as a serpent. Python was the chthonic enemy of Apollo, who slew her and remade her former home his own oracle, the most famous in Classical Greece.\nThe Gorgons - Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa - were three monstrous sisters with sharp fangs and living, venomous snakes for hair, and whose origins predate the written myths of Greece and who were the protectors of the most ancient ritual secrets. The Gorgons wore a belt of two intertwined serpents in the same configuration of the caduceus. The Gorgon was placed at the center, highest point of one of the pediments on the Temple of Artemis at Corfu.\nAsclepius, the son of Apollo and Coronis, learned the secrets of keeping death at bay after observing one serpent bringing another (which Asclepius himself had fatally wounded) back to life with healing herbs. To prevent the entire human race from becoming immortal under Asclepius's care, Zeus killed him with a bolt of lightning. Asclepius' death at the hands of Zeus illustrates man's inability to challenge the natural order that separates mortal men from the gods. In honor of Asclepius, snakes were often used in healing rituals. Non-poisonous snakes were left to crawl on the floor in dormitories where the sick and injured slept. The \"Bibliotheca\" claimed that Athena gave Asclepius a vial of blood from the Gorgons. Gorgon blood had magical properties: if taken from the left side of the Gorgon, it was a fatal poison; from the right side, the blood was capable of bringing the dead back to life. However, Euripides wrote in his tragedy \"Ion\" that the Athenian queen Creusa had inherited this vial from her ancestor Erichthonios, who was a snake himself and had received the vial from Athena. In this version the blood of Medusa had the healing power while the lethal poison originated from Medusa's serpents.\nOlympias, the mother of Alexander the Great and a princess of the primitive land of Epirus, had the reputation of a snake-handler, and it was in serpent form that Zeus was said to have fathered Alexander upon her. Ae\u00ebtes, the king of Colchis and father of the sorceress Medea, possessed the Golden Fleece. He guarded it with a massive serpent that never slept. Medea, who had fallen in love with Jason of the Argonauts, enchanted it to sleep so Jason could seize the Fleece. (See Lamia).\nWhen not driven by horses, the chariot of the Greek sun god is described as being pulled by fiery draconic beings. The most notable instance of this is observed in the episode in which Medea is given her grandfather's chariot, which is pulled by serpents through the sky.\nIn artwork snakes are occasionally associated with Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft.\nHindu mythology.\n\"Naga\" (Sanskrit: \u0928\u093e\u0917) is the Sanskrit/P\u0101li word for a deity or class of entity or being, taking the form of a very large snake, found in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The \"naga\" primarily represents rebirth, death and mortality, due to its casting of its skin and being symbolically \"reborn\".\nHindus associate the \"naga\" with the deities Shiva and Vishnu. Shesha is one of the two mounts of Vishnu, upon which the deity rests. Vasuki is a serpent coiled around the neck of Shiva. The snake represents freedom in Hindu mythology because they cannot be tamed. In Buddhism, the serpent Mucalinda is associated as the protector of Buddha. In Jainism, serpent is associated with the 23rd Tirthankara Parshvanatha.\nHindu symbolism.\nIn Hindu mythology, serpents (N\u0101gas) are considered powerful semi-divine beings associated with water, fertility, and the underworld. N\u0101gas are also linked to cosmic energy (Kundalini) and feature prominently in astrology as the basis for Rahu and Ketu, the lunar nodes representing karmic influences and eclipse-causing shadow planets.\nNagas of Indochina.\nSerpents, or \"n\u0101gas\", play a particularly important role in Khmer mythology. An origin myth explains the emergence of the name \"Cambodia\" as resulting from conquest of a naga princess by a Kambuja lord named Kaundinya: the descendants of their union are the Khmer people. George C\u0153d\u00e8s suggests the Cambodian myth is a basis for the Thai legend of \"Phra Daeng Nang Ai\", in which a woman who has lived many previous lives in the region is reincarnated as a daughter of Phraya Khom (Thai for Cambodian) and causes the death of her companion in former lives who has been reincarnated as a prince of the Nagas. This leads to war between the \"spirits of the air\" and the Nagas: Nagas amok are rivers in spate, and the entire region is flooded. The Myth of the Toad King tells how introduction of Buddhist teachings led to war with the sky deity Phaya Thaen, and ended in a truce with nagas posted as guardians of entrances to temples.\nNative American mythology.\nSome Native American tribes give reverence to the rattlesnake as grandfather and king of snakes who is able to give fair winds or cause tempest. Among the Hopi of Arizona the serpent figures largely in one of the dances. The rattlesnake was worshiped in the Natchez Temple of the Sun, and the Aztec deity Quetzalcoatl was a feathered serpent-god. In many Meso-American cultures, the serpent was regarded as a portal between two worlds. The tribes of Peru are said to have adored great snakes in the pre-Inca days, and in Chile the Mapuche made a serpent figure in their deluge beliefs.\nA Horned Serpent is a popular image in Northern American natives' mythology.\nIn one Native North American story, an evil serpent kills one of the gods' cousins, so the god kills the serpent in revenge, but the dying serpent unleashes a great flood. People first flee to the mountains and then, when the mountains are covered, they float on a raft until the flood subsides. The evil spirits that the serpent god controlled then hide out of fear. The Mound Builders associated great mystical value to the serpent, as the Serpent Mound demonstrates, though we are unable to unravel the particular associations.\nNordic mythology.\nJ\u00f6rmungandr, alternately referred to as the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent, is a sea serpent of Norse mythology, the middle child of Loki and the giantess Angrbo\u00f0a. According to the \"Prose Edda\", Odin took Loki's three children, Fenris\u00falfr, Hel and J\u00f6rmungandr. He tossed J\u00f6rmungandr into the great ocean that encircles Midgard. The serpent grew so big that he was able to surround the Earth and grasp his own tail, and as a result he earned the alternate name of the Midgard Serpent or World Serpent. J\u00f6rmungandr's arch enemy is the god Thor.\nIn the \"Poetic Edda\", Odin tells of eight serpents gnawing on the roots of Yggdrasil: Nidh\u00f6ggr, Gravvitnir, Moin, Goin, Gr\u00e1bakr, Grafv\u00f6llu\u00f0r, Svafnir and Ofnir.\nFolklore.\nIn folk and fairy tale traditions all over the world, the serpent and the snake appear as characters in several fairy tales, either a main character in animal fables and magic tales (\"M\u00e4rchen\"), or as the donor who grants the protagonist a special ability or impart him with some secret knowledge.\nAccording to the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, the serpent can appear in this capacity in the following tale types:\nFlags and heraldry.\nSerpents or snakes appear on the flags or coats of arms of several entities.\nAmerican Revolution.\nIn 1754 and again during the American Revolution, Benjamin Franklin published the Join, or Die. cartoon in \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\" to give a message of colonial unity. The cartoon shows a snake in eight pieces, each representing one or more of the Thirteen Colonies. It was based on a superstition that if a snake was cut in pieces and the pieces were put together before sunset, the snake would return to life.\nFollowing the publication of \"Join, or Die\", the rattlesnake became a symbol of the Thirteen Colonies. Franklin and other colonists considered the rattlesnake to represent independence and vigilance. Several flags of the American Revolution depict rattlesnakes. Two of the more notable flags with the rattlesnake imagery are the Gadsden flag and the First Navy Jack. The United States War Office, and its successor organizations the Department of War and Department of the Army, contain a rattlesnake in their emblems.\nModern symbolism.\nModern medicine.\nSnakes entwined the staffs both of Hermes (the caduceus) and of Asclepius, where a single snake entwined the rough staff. On Hermes' caduceus, the snakes were not merely duplicated for symmetry, they were paired opposites. (This motif is congruent with the phurba.) The wings at the head of the staff identified it as belonging to the winged messenger Hermes, the Roman Mercury, who was the god of magic, diplomacy and rhetoric, of inventions and discoveries, and the protector both of merchants and that allied occupation, to the mythographers' view, of thieves. It is however Hermes' role as psychopomp, the escort of newly deceased souls to the afterlife, that explains the origin of the snakes in the caduceus, since this was also the role of the Sumerian entwined serpent god Ningizzida, with whom Hermes has sometimes been equated.\nIn Late Antiquity, as the arcane study of alchemy developed, Mercury was understood to be the protector of those arts too and of arcane or occult \"Hermetic\" information in general. Chemistry and medicines linked the rod of Hermes with the staff of the healer Asclepius, which was wound with a serpent; it was conflated with Mercury's rod, and the modern medical symbol\u2014which should simply be the rod of Asclepius\u2014often became Mercury's wand of commerce. Another version is used in alchemy where the snake is crucified, known as Nicolas Flamel's caduceus. Art historian Walter J. Friedlander, in \"The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine\" (1992), collected hundreds of examples of the caduceus and the rod of Asclepius and found that professional associations were just somewhat more likely to use the staff of Asclepius, while commercial organizations in the medical field were more likely to use the caduceus.\nModern political propaganda.\nFollowing the Christian context as a symbol for evil, serpents are sometimes featured in political propaganda. They were used to represent Jews in antisemitic propaganda. Snakes were also used to represent the evil side of drugs in such films as \"Narcotic\" and \"Narcotics: Pit of Despair\". The Gadsden flag of the American Revolution continues to be used in modern political propaganda to connote libertarianism and anti-government sentiments.\nAutomobiles.\nThe automobile brands AC Cobra, Ford Mustang Shelby, Zarooq Motors, Dodge Viper, and Alpha Romeo all feature snakes on their logos.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

A gland may also function to remove unwanted substances such as urine from the body.\nThere are two types of gland, each with a different method of secretion. Endocrine glands are ductless and secrete their products, hormones, directly into interstitial spaces to be taken up into the bloodstream. Exocrine glands secrete their products through a duct into a body cavity or outer surface.\nGlands are mostly composed of epithelial tissue, and typically have a supporting framework of connective tissue, and a capsule.\nStructure.\nDevelopment.\nEvery gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface. This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.\nAs growth proceeds, the column of cells may split or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another. One exception to this rule is the liver; this occurs when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.\nGlands are classified according to their shape.\nTypes of glands.\nGlands are divided based on their function into two groups:\nEndocrine glands.\nEndocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the bloodstream. The glands secrete their products through basal lamina into the bloodstream. Basal lamina typically can be seen as a layer around the glands to which more than a million tiny blood vessels are attached. These glands often secrete hormones which play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.\nExocrine glands.\nExocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer or inner surface of the body, such as the skin or the gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:\nExocrine glands can further be categorized by their product:\nClinical significance.\nAdenosis is any disease of a gland. The diseased gland has abnormal formation or development of glandular tissue which is sometimes tumorous.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58907", "revid": "43270384", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58907", "title": "Melodica", "text": "Free-reed instrument\nThe melodica is a handheld free reed instrument similar in sound to a pump organ or harmonica. It features a musical keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into a hole in the side of the instrument. The keyboard usually covers two or three octaves. Melodicas are small, lightweight, and portable, and many are designed for children to play. They are popular in music education programs, especially in Asia. The modern form of the instrument was invented by Hohner in the late 1950s, though similar instruments have been known in Italy since the 19th century.\nDescription.\nThe mouthpiece can be a short rigid or semi-flexible plastic piece or a long flexible plastic tube (designed to allow the player to either hold the keyboard so the keys can be seen or lay the keyboard horizontally on a flat surface for two-handed playing). A foot pump can also be used as an alternative to breathing into the instrument. Melodica keyboards typically ascend from a low F note. Keyboards often have 32 or 37 keys, though instruments may have as few as 13 or as many as 45 keys. Larger models include the Hammond Pro 44 or the Ballone Burini Eolina P45, with 44 and 45 keys respectively.\nAs a free reed instrument, the melodica produces sound by pushing air past individual reeds corresponding to each playable note. When a key is pressed, it opens a valve blocking its corresponding reed, allowing air to pass through it. The sound of each vibrating reed reverberates in the shell of the instrument, which may be made of plastic, timber or metal. Players can control the instrument's volume with air pressure. Unlike most wind instruments, the melodica can play multiple notes simultaneously, limited only by the amount of air available. An external microphone can be used to amplify the instrument or record its sound. Hammond's Pro-44 melodion and Pro 24-B bass melodion each have built-in dynamic microphones which can be connected to a PA system or recording device via a single TRS 1/4\" jack output. As early as 1968, Hohner sold a \"Professional\" model of its Melodica with a built-in pickup.\nMelodicas range in price from under US$20 for a simple, plastic instrument to several thousand dollars for a rare, custom-made or antique model.\nUse.\nThe melodica was first used as a serious musical instrument in the 1960s by composers such as Steve Reich, in his piece titled \"Melodica\" (1966). Brazilian multi-instrumentalist Hermeto Pascoal developed a technique consisting of singing while playing the melodica, resulting in a wide tonal and harmonic palette. Jamaican dub and reggae musician Augustus Pablo popularized it in the 1970s, and his son Addis Pablo takes after him in the same genres. The American musician Jon Batiste was often seen playing a melodica on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\". Funk keyboardist Bernie Worrell played melodica on multiple recordings in Bootsy Collins's discography. The instrument is also associated with the Inti Raymi festival in Otavalo, Ecuador.\nTypes.\nMelodicas are classified primarily by the range of the instrument. Melodicas with different ranges have slightly different shapes.\nAlternative names.\nThe melodica is known by various names, often at the whim of the manufacturer. \"Melodion\" (Suzuki), \"Triola\" (Seydel), \"Melodika\" (Apollo), \"Melodia\" (Diana), \"Pianica\" (Yamaha), \"Melodihorn\" (Samick), \"Melodyhorn\" (Angel), \"Diamonica\" (Bontempi), \"Pianetta\" (Guerrini), \"face piano\", and \"Clavietta\" (Borel/Beuscher) are just some of the variants. When a recording technician unfamiliar with the melodica called it a \"hooter\", the band the Hooters took that as their name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58908", "revid": "19691760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58908", "title": "Concertina", "text": "Free-reed musical instrument\nA concertina is a free-reed musical instrument, like the various accordions and the harmonica. It consists of expanding and contracting bellows, with buttons (or keys) usually on both ends, unlike accordion buttons, which are on the front.\nThe concertina was developed independently in both England and Germany. The English version was invented in 1829 by Sir Charles Wheatstone, while Carl Friedrich Uhlig introduced the German version five years later, in 1834. Various forms of concertina are used for classical music, for the traditional music of Ireland, England, and South Africa, and for tango and polka music. \nThe concertina has historically been a favorite instrument among people who travel often (due to its small and compact size), leading it to be a common instrument among soldiers, sailors, and cowboys. One was even brought aboard Robert Peary's 1891 expedition of the Greenland Arctic. Despite the pop-culture association of the concertina with the Golden Age of Piracy, the concertina was invented approximately 100 years after the heyday of piracy in the North Atlantic.\nSystems.\nConcertinas are members of a family of hand-held bellows-driven free reed instruments constructed according to various \"systems\" which differ in terms of keyboard layout and whether individual buttons (keys) produce the same (unisonoric) or different (bisonoric) notes with changes in the direction of air pressure.\nBecause the concertina was developed nearly contemporaneously in England and Germany, systems can be broadly divided into English, Anglo-German, and German types. To a player proficient in one of these systems, a concertina of a different system will be quite unfamiliar.\nEnglish and Duet concertinas.\nThe \"English concertina\" and the \"Duet concertina\" bear similarities in history and construction. Both systems generally play a chromatic scale and are unisonoric, with each key producing the same note whether the bellows are being pushed or pulled. Both of these English instruments are smaller than German concertinas, and are usually hexagonal in shape, though occasionally featuring 8, 10, or 12 sides. The English system alternates the notes of the scale between two hands, enabling rapid melodies. The duet system features the lower notes on the left, and higher notes on the right, facilitating the playing of interlaced harmonies and melodies.\nThe English concertina is credited to Sir Charles Wheatstone, who first patented such a design in 1829 in Great Britain. Wheatstone was also the first to patent a duet concertina, in 1844.\nGerman concertinas.\nGerman concertinas, developed in Germany for its local market and diaspora, are usually larger than English concertinas, and are generally bisonoric, using a different style of \"long plate\" reeds, and are often square, as opposed to hexagonal. German concertinas also sometimes have more than one reed per note, which produces a vibrato effect if their tuning differs slightly .\nChemnitzer concertina.\nVarious German concertina systems share common construction features and core keyboard layout. In the United States, particularly in the Midwest where there are many German and Central European descendants, the term \"concertina\" often refers to the Chemnitzer concertina, which is bisonoric and closely related to the bandoneon, but features a different keyboard layout and decorative style, including a few mechanical innovations pioneered by German-American instrument builder and inventor Otto Schlicht. A related variant is the Carlsfelder concertina from C. F. Zimmerman, created in 1849 and shown at the 1851 London Industrial Exposition. The Chemnitzer concertina is popular among polka musicians in the American Midwest, most famously played by Li'l Wally.\nBandoneon.\nThe bandoneon (also rendered bandone\u00f3n, bandonion) is a German concertina system with an original bisonoric layout devised by Heinrich Band. Although intended as a substitute for the organ in small churches and chapels, it was soon secularized and is now associated with tango music due to the instrument's popularity in Argentina since the late 19th century when tango developed from various dance styles in Argentina and Uruguay. Though the typical bandoneon is bisonoric, the 1920s saw the development of unisonoric variants such as the Ernst Kusserow and Charles Peguri systems, both introduced around 1925. Bandoneons typically have more than one reed per button, dry-tuned with the reeds an octave apart. \"Dry\" means that vibrato is absent because the tuning is accurate. The instrument is considered an essential part of the Argentine tango orchestra.\nAnglo concertina.\nThe \"Anglo\" or \"Anglo-German\" concertina is, historically, a hybrid between the English and German concertinas. The button layouts are generally the same as the original 20-button German concertinas designed by Uhlig in 1834, and in a bisonoric system. Within a few years of its invention, the \"German concertina\" was a popular import in England, Ireland, and North America, due to its ease of use and relatively low price. English manufacturers responded to this popularity by offering their own versions using traditional English methods: concertina reeds instead of long-plate reeds, independent pivots for each button, and hexagon-shaped ends, resulting in the modern Anglo concertina.\nFranglo.\nThe \"Franglo\" system concertina was developed by the luthiers C &amp; R Dipper, in cooperation with Emmanuel Pariselle, known for his expertise as a professional player of the two-and-a-half row diatonic melodeon. The system has the construction and reed-work of a concertina with the buttons at the sides, but the layout of the buttons is that of a melodeon. The name \"Franglo\" blends the words French and Anglo.\nHistory.\n19th century.\nIn the mid-1830s concertinas were manufactured and sold in Germany and England, in two types specific to the country. Both systems continued to evolve into the current forms as the popularity of the instrument increased. The difference in prices and the common uses of the English and German systems led to something of a class distinction between the two. German or Anglo-German concertinas were regarded as a lower-class instrument while the English concertina had an air of bourgeois respectability. English concertinas were most popular as parlor instruments for classical music, while German concertinas were more associated with the popular dance music at that time.\nIn the 1850s, the Anglo-German concertina's ability to play both melody and accompaniment led English manufacturers to start developing the various duet systems. The popular Maccann system was developed towards the end of the century; meanwhile, German manufacturers were producing concertinas with more than 20 keys for local sale. Three keyboard systems for German concertinas eventually became popular: Uhlig's Chemnitzer system, Carl Zimmerman's Carlsfeld system, and the Bandoneon's Reinische system. Various German manufacturers tried to develop a single unified keyboard system for all German concertinas, but this was only partially accomplished by the end of the 19th century, when the Chemnitzer and Carlsfelder systems merged into the unified concertina system, and a unified bandoneon system was created. Despite the new standards, the older systems remained popular into the 20th century.\nThe concertina was popular throughout the 19th century. The Salvation Army in England, America, Australia, and New Zealand commonly used concertinas in their bands, and other concertina bands and musicians performed in all parts of the English-speaking world. German emigrants brought their Chemnitzers and bandoneons with them to the United States and Argentina where they became regionally popular.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn the early 20th century, the concertina's popularity rapidly declined as demand for the accordion increased, along with mass production of other instruments such as the piano which are more suited to chromatic forms of music like blues and jazz. By the middle of the century, few concertina makers remained, and most of those used accordion reeds and inexpensive, unreliable keyboard mechanisms. Yet, the various forms of concertina survived in some areas: Anglo concertinas in Irish traditional music, the English and the Anglo in English Morris dancing, the Anglo in Africa, among Afrikaners (see Boer music) and Zulus (who call it a \"squashbox\"), the Chemnitzer in the United States as a polka instrument, and the bandoneon in Argentina as a prominent part of the tango tradition. Between World War I and World War II, there were many concertina and bandoneon bands in Germany, but with the rise of the Nazi regime these musical clubs disappeared.\nFolk revival and present.\nThe folk revival movements of the 1960s led to a modest resurgence in the popularity of the concertina, particularly the Anglo. More recently, concertina popularity again seems on the rise, particularly the Anglo in the traditional music of Ireland and England. Renewed interest in tango since the 1980s has also seen interest in the bandoneon increase. American country/folk musician Willi Carlisle has been introducing the concertina (along with the button accordion) into American country music, reflecting a general resurgence of accordions in American music as well.\nTraditional music playing continues in many parts of the UK in the 21st century, often using English and Anglo-system concertinas. Concertinas are mass-produced in Italy and China, and are produced by individual workshops in Europe, South Africa, Australia, and North America. Modern-made instruments are in a spectrum of quality and traditionalism, with the most expensive instruments using traditional concertina-type reeds, while mid-level and inexpensive instruments take advantage of the lower price of mass-produced accordion reeds.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other names include \"morbilli\", \"rubeola\", \"9-day measles, red measles\", and \"English measles\".\nSymptoms usually develop 10\u201312 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7\u201310 days. Initial symptoms typically include fever, often greater than , cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Small white spots known as Koplik spots may form inside the mouth two or three days after the start of symptoms. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Common complications include diarrhea (in 8% of cases), middle ear infection (7%), and pneumonia (6%). These occur in part due to measles-induced immunosuppression. Less commonly, seizures, blindness, or inflammation of the brain may occur.\nMeasles is an airborne disease which spreads easily from one person to the next through the coughs and sneezes of infected people. It may also be spread through direct contact with mouth or nasal secretions. It is extremely contagious: nine out of ten people who are not immune and share living space with an infected person will be infected. Furthermore, measles's reproductive number estimates vary beyond the frequently cited range of 12 to 18, with a 2017 review giving a range of 3.7 to 203.3. People are infectious to others from four days before to four days after the start of the rash. While often regarded as a childhood illness, it can affect people of any age. Most people do not get the disease more than once. Testing for the measles virus in suspected cases is important for public health efforts. Measles is not known to occur in other animals.\nOnce a person has become infected, no specific treatment is available, although supportive care may improve outcomes. Such care may include oral rehydration solution (slightly sweet and salty fluids), healthy food, and medications to control the fever. Antibiotics should be prescribed if secondary bacterial infections such as ear infections or pneumonia occur. Vitamin A supplementation is also recommended for children under the age of 5. Among cases reported in the U.S. between 1985 and 1992, death occurred in 0.2% of cases, but may be up to 10% in people with malnutrition. Most of those who die from the infection are less than five years old.\nThe measles vaccine is safe and very effective at preventing the disease, and is often delivered in combination with other vaccines. Due to the ease with which measles is transmitted from person to person in a community, more than 95% of the community must be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity. Vaccination resulted in an 80% decrease in deaths from measles between 2000 and 2017, with about 85% of children worldwide having received their first dose as of 2017. Measles affects about 20 million people a year, primarily in the developing areas of Africa and Asia. It is one of the leading vaccine-preventable disease causes of death. In 1980, 2.6 million people died from measles, and in 1990, 545,000 died due to the disease; by 2014, global vaccination programs had reduced the number of deaths from measles to 73,000. Despite these trends, rates of disease and deaths increased from 2017 to 2019 due to a decrease in vaccination.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSigns and symptoms.\nSymptoms typically begin 7\u201314 days (typically 11\u201312 days) after exposure with a prodrome of fever, malaise, and cough. The fever with measles increases in a stepwise fashion and peaks at - . After one to two days of prodromal illness, Koplik spots appear inside the cheeks opposite the molars as clusters of white lesions (\"grains of salt\") on reddened areas. They are pathognomonic for measles, but are present for only a short time and therefore are not always seen. The classic symptoms include a fever, cough, coryza (head cold, fever, sneezing), and conjunctivitis, referred to as \"the three C's\", and a maculopapular rash.\nThe characteristic measles rash is classically described as a generalized red maculopapular rash that begins three to five days after the prodrome; on average, 14 days after exposure, but as few as 7 or as many as 21 days post-exposure. The rash starts on the back of the ears or on the face and thereafter spreads to the rest of the body. It is caused by the cellular and humoral immune system's clearing of infected skin cells, as is the conjunctivitis. Measles conjunctivitis often also causes photophobia. The rash is said to \"stain\", changing color from red to dark brown, before disappearing.\nUncomplicated cases of measles typically improve within days of rash onset and resolve within 7\u201310 days.\nPeople who have been vaccinated against measles but have incomplete protective immunity may experience a form of modified measles. Modified measles is characterized by a prolonged incubation period, milder, and less characteristic symptoms (sparse and discrete rash of short duration). Because development of the rash and conjunctivitis requires a functional immune system, immunocompromised people may not be diagnosed as readily.\nComplications.\nComplications of measles are relatively common. Some are caused directly by the virus, while others are caused by viral suppression of the immune system. This phenomenon, known as \"immune amnesia\", increases the risk of secondary bacterial infections; two months after recovery there is an 11\u201373% decrease in the number of antibodies against other bacteria and viruses. Population studies from prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine suggest that immune amnesia typically lasts 2\u20133 years. Primate studies suggest that immune amnesia in measles is effected by replacement of memory lymphocytes with ones that are specific to measles virus, since they are destroyed after being infected by the virus. This creates lasting immunity to measles re-infection, but decreases immunity to other pathogens. Complications may be directly related to the virus - e.g. viral pneumonia or viral laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) - or related to the damage measles virus causes to tissues and the immune system. The most serious direct complications include acute encephalitis, corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring); and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a progressive and fatal inflammation of the brain that occurs in about 1 in 600 unvaccinated infants under 15 months. Common secondary infections include infectious diarrhea, bacterial pneumonia, and otitis media.\nThe death rate in the 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia. People who are at high risk for complications are infants and children aged less than 5 years; adults aged over 20 years; pregnant women; people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia, HIV infection or innate immunodeficiency; and those who are malnourished or have vitamin A deficiency. Complications are usually more severe in adults. Between 1987 and 2000, the case fatality rate across the United States was three deaths per 1,000 cases attributable to measles, or 0.3%. In underdeveloped nations with high rates of malnutrition and poor healthcare, fatality rates have been as high as 28%. In immunocompromised persons (e.g., people with AIDS) the fatality rate is approximately 30%.\nEven in previously healthy children, measles can cause serious illness requiring hospitalization. One out of every 1,000 measles cases progresses to acute encephalitis, which often results in permanent brain damage. One to three out of every 1,000 children who become infected with measles will die from respiratory and neurological complications.\nCause.\nMeasles is caused by the measles virus, a single-stranded, non-segmented, negative-sense, enveloped RNA virus of the genus \"Morbillivirus\" within the family \"Paramyxoviridae\". It is related most closely to rinderpest, a cattle virus eradicated in 2001, and canine distemper, a mammalian disease that causes neurologic deterioration. There are 24 strains of measles virus divided into eight clades designated A-H.\nThe virus is one of the most contagious human pathogens and is spread by coughing and sneezing via close personal contact or direct contact with secretions. It remains infectious for up to two hours via suspended respiratory droplets. It is not easily spread by fomites, because the virus is inactivated within a few hours by ultraviolet light and heat. It is also inactivated by trypsin, acidic environments, and ether. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90% of non-immune people who have close contact with them (e.g., household members) will also become infected. Humans are the only natural hosts of the virus, and no other animal reservoirs are known to exist, although mountain gorillas are believed to be susceptible to the disease.\nRisk factors for measles virus infection include immunodeficiency caused by HIV/AIDS, immunosuppression following receipt of an organ or a stem cell transplant, alkylating agents, or corticosteroid therapy, regardless of immunization status; travel to areas where measles commonly occurs or contact with travelers from such an area; and the loss of passive, inherited antibodies before the age of routine immunization.\nPathophysiology.\nOnce the measles virus contacts the mucosa lining the respiratory tract, it binds to SLAM (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule, also known as CD150) on the surface of macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells then take up the virus. This process is mediated by the hemagglutinin protein (H) on the surface of the measles virus binding to SLAM and causing the fusion protein in the viral capsule (F) to change shape, allowing the envelope to fuse with the viral RNA and viral proteins entry. The L protein, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, then transcribes the viral negative-sense genome into a positive-sense mRNA, which is translated by the cell's native ribosomes into viral proteins. These immune cells pass the virus on to other groups of immune cells, including B cells, T cells, thymocytes, and hematopoietic stem cells, which disseminate the virus to other organs during the incubation period.\nThe initial period of infection in the lung lasts for two to three days, and ends with the first period of viremia. Five to seven days after infection begins, the second viremia occurs, and the virus infects epithelial cells. The virus spreads along epithelial cells, initially in the respiratory tree via intercellular pores, and later in the linings of other organs and the respiratory tree via nectin-4 receptors. This causes the cough seen clinically, which aerosolizes the virus and enables it to spread.\nDiagnosis.\nTypically, clinical diagnosis begins with the onset of fever and malaise about 10 days after exposure to the measles virus, followed by the emergence of cough, coryza, and conjunctivitis that worsen in severity over 4 days of appearing. Observation of Koplik's spots is also diagnostic. Other diseases that may appear similar to measles include dengue fever, rubella, erythema infectiosum (also called fifth disease, caused by parvovirus B19), and roseola (also called exanthem subitum or sixth disease, caused by HHV6). Laboratory confirmation is therefore strongly recommended, especially in non-endemic areas.\nLaboratory testing.\nLaboratory diagnosis of measles can be done with confirmation of positive measles IgM antibodies or detection of measles virus RNA from throat, nasal or urine specimen by using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. This method is particularly useful to confirm cases when the IgM antibodies results are inconclusive. For people unable to have their blood drawn, saliva can be collected for salivary measles-specific IgA testing. Salivary tests used to diagnose measles involve collecting a saliva sample and testing for the presence of measles antibodies. This method is not ideal, as saliva contains many other fluids and proteins which may make it difficult to collect samples and detect measles antibodies. Saliva also contains 800 times fewer antibodies than blood samples do, which makes salivary testing additionally difficult. Positive contact with other people known to have measles adds evidence to the diagnosis.\nBiopsies and histopathologic examinations are not typically used to diagnose measles, but Warthin\u2013Finkeldey cells, giant cells with multiple nuclei and eosinophilic inclusions, are frequently seen in affected lymphoid tissue but are not unique to measles. Affected epithelium may have giant cells with viral inclusion bodies or Cowdry bodies.\nPrevention.\nMothers who are immune to measles pass antibodies to their children while they are still in the womb, especially if the mother acquired immunity through infection rather than vaccination. Such antibodies will usually give newborn infants some immunity against measles, but these antibodies are gradually lost over the course of the first nine months of life. However, immunization with live vaccines is not recommended in pregnancy; pregnant people found to be non-immune to measles should be immunized after delivery. Infants under one year of age whose maternal anti-measles antibodies have disappeared become susceptible to infection with the measles virus.\nIt is generally recommended that children be immunized against measles at 12 months, as part of a three-part MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, and rubella). The vaccine is generally not given before this age because younger infants respond inadequately to the vaccine due to an immature immune system. A second dose of the vaccine is recommended between the ages of four and five, to increase rates of immunity. Adverse reactions to vaccination are rare, with fever and pain at the injection site being the most common. Life-threatening adverse reactions occur in less than one per million vaccinations (&lt;0.0001%).\nIn areas with a high risk of measles infection, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the first two doses of vaccine be given earlier, at nine and eighteen months of age. The vaccine should be given whether the child is HIV-infected or not. The vaccine is less effective in HIV-infected infants than in the general population, but early treatment with antiretroviral drugs can increase its effectiveness. Measles vaccination programs are often used to deliver other child health interventions as well, such as bed nets to protect against malaria, antiparasitic medicine, and vitamin A supplements, and so contribute to the reduction of child deaths from other causes.\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all adult international travelers who do not have positive evidence of previous measles immunity receive two doses of MMR vaccine before traveling. Birth before 1957 is presumptive evidence of immunity. People born before 1957 are likely to have been naturally infected with the measles virus and generally need not be considered susceptible.\nThere have been false claims of an association between the measles vaccine and autism; this incorrect concern has reduced the rate of vaccination and increased the number of cases of measles where immunization rates became too low to maintain herd immunity. Additionally, there have been false claims that measles infection protects against cancer.\nAdministration of the MMR vaccine may prevent measles after exposure to the virus (post-exposure prophylaxis). Post-exposure prophylaxis guidelines are specific to jurisdiction and population. Passive immunization against measles by an intramuscular injection of antibodies could be effective up to the seventh day after exposure. Compared to no treatment, the risk of measles infection is reduced by 83%, and the risk of death by measles is reduced by 76%. However, the effectiveness of passive immunization in comparison to active measles vaccine is not clear.\nThe MMR vaccine is 95% effective for preventing measles after one dose if the vaccine is given to a child who is twelve months of age or older; if a second dose of the MMR vaccine is given, it will provide immunity in 97-99% of children.\nVitamin A and measles prevention.\n\"Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and middle-income countries, affecting 190 million children under five years of age and leading to many adverse health consequences, including death.\" Vitamin A deficiency is rare in the United States. A meta-analysis of clinical trials conducted in countries where VAD is prevalent concluded that when children were supplemented with vitamin A, there was a 50% reduction in incidence of contracting measles. By way of comparison, vaccination with two doses of the measles vaccine in childhood provides 97-99% protection at preventing measles. Vitamin A supplementation is not thought to reduce the risk of death from measles. Children given high doses of vitamin A from supplements or cod liver oil can accumulate to toxic levels and this can lead to hypervitaminosis A and liver damage.\nA 2016 Cochrane review of two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 260 children with measles compared vitamin A to placebo. Crucially, neither study reported blindness or other ocular morbidities as primary outcomes. One trial showed a temporary increase in serum retinol levels, but no sustained effect or impact on weight gain. The second trial found no significant difference in serum retinol levels or rates of undernutrition. Therefore, the authors concluded that no trials were found that assessed whether vitamin A supplementation in children with measles prevents blindness.\nIn the 2025 Southwest United States measles outbreak, centered in West Texas, some families continued to refuse vaccines and instead opted for giving vitamin A supplements or vitamins A- and D-containing cod liver oil to their children after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., promoted vitamin A as prevention and treatment. Multiple children hospitalized for measles at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock also showed signs of liver damage, a symptom of vitamin A toxicity. As of May 2025, regardless of such serious side effects\u2014and possibly resulting in increased disease spread\u2014Kennedy, in his role as Secretary of Health and Human Services, has nevertheless continued to endorse vitamin A during the measles epidemic, along with other unscientific, non-vaccine measures, a response for which he has been widely criticized.\nTreatment.\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment if measles develops. Instead the medications are generally aimed at treating superinfections, maintaining good hydration with adequate fluids, and pain relief. Supportive treatment can include ibuprofen or paracetamol (acetaminophen) to reduce fever and pain and, if required, a fast-acting medication to dilate the airways for cough.\nSome groups, such as young children and the severely malnourished, are also physician-administered vitamin A, which acts as an immunomodulator that boosts the antibody responses to measles and decreases the risk of serious complications. While vitamin A treatment does not cure the disease or reduce mortality in every age group, two doses (200,000 IU) of vitamin A was shown to reduce mortality in children younger than two years of age. In the 2025 U.S. outbreak, children are presenting at hospitals with measles and hypervitaminosis A because their parents were administering vitamin A sources (supplements or cod liver oil) as attempts of protection before the children became ill with measles.\nZinc supplementation for children with measles has not been sufficiently studied. Similarly, there is no randomized clinical trial evidence for or against whether Chinese medicinal herbs are an effective treatment.\nPrognosis.\nMost people survive measles, though in some cases, complications may occur. About 1 in 4 individuals will be hospitalized and 1\u20132 in 1,000 will die. Complications are more likely in children under age 5, adults over age 20, and pregnant people. Pneumonia is the most common fatal complication of measles infection and accounts for 56\u201386% of measles-related deaths.\nPossible consequences of measles virus infection include laryngotracheobronchitis, sensorineural hearing loss, and\u2014in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 300,000 cases\u2014panencephalitis, which is usually fatal. Acute measles encephalitis is another serious risk of measles virus infection. It typically occurs two days to one week after the measles rash breaks out and begins with very high fever, severe headache, convulsions and altered mentation. A person with measles encephalitis may become comatose, and death or brain injury may occur.\nFor people having had measles, it is rare to ever have a symptomatic reinfection.\nThe measles virus can deplete previously acquired immune memory by killing cells that make antibodies, and thus weakens the immune system, which can cause deaths from other diseases. Suppression of the immune system by measles lasts about two years and has been epidemiologically implicated in up to 90% of childhood deaths in third world countries, and historically may have caused rather more deaths in the United States, the UK and Denmark than were directly caused by measles. Although the measles vaccine contains an attenuated strain, it does not deplete immune memory.\nEpidemiology.\nMeasles is extremely infectious and its continued circulation in a community depends on the generation of susceptible hosts by birth of children. In communities that generate insufficient new hosts the disease will die out. This concept was first recognized in measles by M.S. Bartlett in 1957, who referred to the minimum number supporting measles as the critical community size (CCS). Analysis of outbreaks in island communities suggested that the CCS for measles is around 250,000. Due to the ease with which measles is transmitted from person to person in a community, more than 95% of the community must be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity.\nIn 2011, the WHO estimated that 158,000 deaths were caused by measles. This is down from 630,000 deaths in 1990. As of 2018, measles remains a leading cause of vaccine-preventable deaths in the world. In developed countries the mortality rate is lower, for example in England and Wales from 2007 to 2017 death occurred between two and three cases out of 10,000. In children one to three cases out of every 1,000 die in the United States (0.1\u20130.2%). In populations with high levels of malnutrition and a lack of adequate healthcare, mortality can be as high as 10%. In cases with complications, the rate may rise to 20\u201330%. In 2012, the number of deaths due to measles was 78% lower than in 2000 due to increased rates of immunization among UN member states. Between 2000 and 2016, global cases decreased by 84%; by 2019 cases had increased to a total of 870,000, the highest since 1996.\nEven in countries where vaccination has been introduced, rates may remain high. Measles is a leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality. Worldwide, the fatality rate has been significantly reduced by a vaccination campaign led by partners in the Measles Initiative: the American Red Cross, the United States CDC, the United Nations Foundation, UNICEF and the WHO. Globally, measles fell 60% from an estimated 873,000 deaths in 1999 to 345,000 in 2005. Estimates for 2008 indicate deaths fell further to 164,000 globally, with 77% of the remaining measles deaths in 2008 occurring within the Southeast Asian region. There were 142,300 measles related deaths globally in 2018, of which most cases were reported from African and eastern Mediterranean regions. These estimates were slightly higher than that of 2017, when 124,000 deaths were reported due to measles infection globally.\nIn 2000, the WHO established the Global Measles and Rubella Laboratory Network (GMRLN) to provide laboratory surveillance for measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome. Data from 2016 to 2018 show that the most frequently detected measles virus genotypes are decreasing, suggesting that increasing global population immunity has decreased the number of chains of transmission.\nCases reported in the first three months of 2019 were 300% higher than in the first three months of 2018, with outbreaks in every region of the world, even in countries with high overall vaccination coverage where it spread among clusters of unvaccinated people. The numbers of reported cases as of mid-November is over 413,000 globally, with an additional 250,000 cases in DRC (as reported through their national system), similar to the increasing trends of infection reported in the earlier months of 2019, compared to 2018. In 2019, the total number of cases worldwide climbed to 869,770. The number of cases reported for 2020 is lower compare to 2019. According to the WHO, the COVID-19 pandemic hindered vaccination campaigns in at least 68 countries, including in countries that were experiencing outbreaks, which caused increased risk of additional cases.\nIn 2022, there were an estimated 136,000 measles deaths globally, mostly among unvaccinated or under vaccinated children under the age of 5 years.\nIn February 2024, the World Health Organization said more than half of the world was at risk of a measles outbreak due to COVID-19 pandemic-related disruptions in that month. All the world regions have reported such outbreaks with the exception of the Americas, though these could still be expected to become hotspots in the future. Death rates during the outbreaks tend to be higher among poorer countries but middle-income nations are also heavily impacted, according to the WHO.\nIn November 2024, the WHO and CDC reported that measles cases increased by 20% in 2023, primarily due to insufficient vaccine coverage in the world's poorest and conflict-affected regions, increasing from about 8.6 to 10.3 million cases. Nearly half of the major outbreaks and 64% of the individual cases occurred in Africa.\nEurope.\nIn England and Wales, though deaths from measles were uncommon, they averaged about 500 per year in the 1940s. Deaths diminished with the improvement of medical care in the 1950s, but the incidence of the disease did not retreat until vaccination was introduced in the late 1960s. Wider coverage was achieved in the 1980s with the measles, mumps and rubella, MMR vaccine.\nIn 2013\u201314, there were almost 10,000 cases in 30 European countries. Most cases occurred in unvaccinated individuals and over 90% of cases occurred in Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Romania, and United Kingdom. Between October 2014 and March 2015, a measles outbreak in the German capital of Berlin resulted in at least 782 cases.\nIn 2016, a record low of 4,400 cases in Europe were reported. However, from 2017, a measles resurgence in Europe started to occur with numbers increasing in that year to 21,315 cases, with 35 deaths. In preliminary figures for 2018, reported cases in the region increased 3-fold to 82,596 in 47 countries, with 72 deaths; Ukraine had the most cases (53,218), with the highest incidence rates being in Ukraine (1209 cases per million), Serbia (579), Georgia (564) and Albania (500). The previous year (2017) saw an estimated measles vaccine coverage of 95% for the first dose and 90% for the second dose in the region, the latter figure being the highest-ever estimated second-dose coverage.\nIn 2019, the United Kingdom, Albania, the Czech Republic, and Greece lost their measles-free status due to ongoing and prolonged spread of the disease in these countries. In the first 6 months of 2019, 90,000 cases occurred in Europe.\nA significant increase in measles cases in Europe occurred in 2024, with 127,350 being reported. This was the highest caseload in the region since 1997, representing a third of global measles cases.\nThe major centre of the resurgent outbreak appeared to be Romania where 30,692 cases were reported.\nAmericas.\nAs a result of widespread vaccination, the disease was declared eliminated from the Americas in 2016. However, there were cases again in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2025 in this region.\nCanada.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], an outbreak in Alberta resulted in 1800 confirmed cases and prompted health experts to advise Albertans to make sure their measles vaccinations were up to date.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, measles affected approximately 3,000 people per million in the 1960s before the vaccine was available. With consistent widespread childhood vaccination, this figure fell to 13 cases per million by the 1980s, and to about 1 case per million by 2000.\nIn 1991, an outbreak of measles in Philadelphia was centered at the Faith Tabernacle Congregation, a faith-healing church that actively discouraged parishioners from vaccinating their children. Over 1400 people were infected with measles and nine children died.\nBefore immunization in the United States, between three and four million cases occurred each year. The United States was declared free of circulating measles in 2000, with 911 cases from 2001 to 2011. In 2014 the CDC said endemic measles, rubella, and congenital rubella syndrome had not returned to the United States. Occasional measles outbreaks persist, however, because of cases imported from abroad, of which more than half are the result of unvaccinated U.S. residents who are infected abroad and infect others upon return to the United States. The CDC continues to recommend measles vaccination throughout the population to prevent outbreaks like these.\nIn 2014, an outbreak was initiated in Ohio when two unvaccinated Amish men harboring asymptomatic measles returned to the United States from missionary work in the Philippines. Their return to a community with low vaccination rates led to an outbreak that rose to include a total of 383 cases across nine counties. Of the 383 cases, 340 (89%) occurred in unvaccinated individuals.\nFrom 4 January, to 2 April 2015, there were 159 cases of measles reported to the CDC. Of those 159 cases, 111 (70%) were determined to have come from an earlier exposure in late December 2014. This outbreak was believed to have originated from the Disneyland theme park in California. The Disneyland outbreak was held responsible for the infection of 147 people in seven U.S. states as well as Mexico and Canada, the majority of which were either unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. Of the cases 48% were unvaccinated and 38% were unsure of their vaccination status. The initial exposure to the virus was never identified.\nIn 2015, a U.S. woman in Washington state died of pneumonia, as a result of measles. She was the first fatality in the U.S. from measles since 2003. The woman had been vaccinated for measles and was taking immunosuppressive drugs for another condition. The drugs suppressed the woman's immunity to measles, and the woman became infected with measles; she did not develop a rash, but contracted pneumonia, which caused her death.\nIn June 2017, the Maine Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory confirmed a case of measles in Franklin County. This instance marks the first case of measles in 20 years for the state of Maine. In 2018, one case occurred in Portland, Oregon, with 500 people exposed; 40 of them lacked immunity to the virus and were being monitored by county health officials as of 2 July 2018. There were 273 cases of measles reported throughout the United States in 2018, including an outbreak in Brooklyn with more than 200 reported cases from October 2018 to February 2019. The outbreak was tied with population density of the Orthodox Jewish community, with the initial exposure from an unvaccinated child that caught measles while visiting Israel.\nA resurgence of measles occurred during 2019, which has been generally tied to parents choosing not to have their children vaccinated as most of the reported cases occurred in people 19 years old or younger. Cases were first reported in Washington state in January, with an outbreak of at least 58 confirmed cases most within Clark County, which has a higher rate of vaccination exemptions compared to the rest of the state; nearly one in four kindergartners in Clark did not receive vaccinations, according to state data. This led Washington state governor Jay Inslee to declare a state of emergency, and the state's congress to introduce legislation to disallow vaccination exemption for personal or philosophical reasons. In April 2019, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a public health emergency because of \"a huge spike\" in cases of measles where there were 285 cases centred on the Orthodox Jewish areas of Brooklyn in 2018, while there were only two cases in 2017. There were 168 more in neighboring Rockland County. Other outbreaks occurred in Santa Cruz County and Butte County in California, and the states of New Jersey and Michigan. As of April 2019[ [update]], there have been 695 cases of measles reported in 22 states. As of \u00a02019[ [update]], this is the highest number of measles cases since measles was declared eliminated in 2000. From January, to December 2019, 1,282 individual cases of measles were confirmed in 31 states. This is the greatest number of cases reported in the US since 1992. Of the 1,282 cases, 128 of the people who got measles were hospitalized, and 61 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis. Following the end of the 2019 outbreak, reported cases fell to pre-outbreak levels: 13 cases in 2020, 49 cases in 2021, and 121 cases in 2022.\nAs of \u00a02025[ [update]], an outbreak of measles is ongoing amongst unvaccinated communities in Texas and New Mexico. On 26 February, the first measles death since 2015 was reported to be that of an unvaccinated school-aged child in West Texas. The confirmed number of measles cases in this outbreak is 124 as of 2025[ [update]], according to the Texas Department of Health Services. Most are in children ages 5\u201317. As of March 2025, the CDC has recorded 483 confirmed cases across 20 states, 2 deaths and 70 hospitalized. This exceeds the entire 2024 total that was only 285.\nBrazil.\nThe spread of measles had been interrupted in Brazil in 2016, with the last-known case twelve months earlier. This last case was in the state of Cear\u00e1.\nBrazil won a measles elimination certificate by the Pan American Health Organization in 2016, but the Ministry of Health has proclaimed that the country has struggled to keep this certificate, since two outbreaks had already been identified in 2018, one in the state of Amazonas and another one in Roraima, in addition to cases in other states (Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Par\u00e1, S\u00e3o Paulo and Rond\u00f4nia), totaling 1,053 confirmed cases until 1 August 2018. In these outbreaks, and in most other cases, the contagion was related to the importation of the virus, especially from Venezuela. This was confirmed by the genotype of the virus (D8) that was identified, which is the same that circulates in Venezuela.\nSoutheast Asia.\nIn the Vietnamese measles epidemic in spring of 2014, an estimated 8,500 measles cases were reported as of 19 April, with 114 fatalities; as of 30 May, 21,639 suspected measles cases had been reported, with 142 measles-related fatalities. In the Naga Self-Administered Zone in a remote northern region of Myanmar, at least 40 children died during a measles outbreak in August 2016 that was probably caused by lack of vaccination in an area of poor health infrastructure. Following the 2019 Philippines measles outbreak, 23,563 measles cases have been reported in the country with 338 fatalities. A measles outbreak also happened among the Malaysian Orang Asli sub-group of Batek people in the state of Kelantan from May 2019, causing the deaths of 15 from the tribe. In 2024, a measles outbreak was declared in the Bangsamoro region in the Philippines with at least 592 cases and 3 deaths.\nSouth Pacific.\nA measles outbreak in New Zealand has 2193 confirmed cases and two deaths. A measles outbreak in Tonga has 612 cases of measles.\nSamoa.\nA measles outbreak in Samoa in late 2019 has over 5,700 cases of measles and 83 deaths, out of a Samoan population of 200,000. Over three percent of the population were infected, and a state of emergency was declared from 17 November to 7 December. A vaccination campaign brought the measles vaccination rate from 31 to 34% in 2018 to an estimated 94% of the eligible population in December 2019.\nAfrica.\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo and Madagascar have reported the highest numbers of cases in 2019. However, cases have decreased in Madagascar as a result of nationwide emergency measles vaccine campaigns. As of August 2019 outbreaks were occurring in Angola, Cameroon, Chad, Nigeria, South Sudan and Sudan.\nMadagascar.\nAn outbreak of measles in 2018 has resulted in well beyond 115,000 cases and over 1,200 deaths.\nDemocratic Republic of Congo.\nAn outbreak of measles with nearly 5,000 deaths and 250,000 infections occurred in 2019, after the disease spread to all the provinces in the country. Most deaths were among children under five years of age. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported this as the world's largest and fastest-moving epidemic.\nHistory.\nMeasles is of zoonotic origin, having evolved from rinderpest, which infected cattle. A precursor of the measles began causing infections in humans as early as the 4th century BC or as late as after 500 AD. The Antonine Plague of 165\u2013180 AD has been speculated to have been measles, but the actual cause of this plague is unknown and smallpox is a more likely cause. The first systematic description of measles as distinct from smallpox and chickenpox is credited to the Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi (860\u2013932), who published \"The Book of Smallpox and Measles\". He described it as \"more to be dreaded than smallpox\". It is believed that, at the time of Razi's book, outbreaks were still limited and the virus was not fully adapted to humans. Sometime between 1100 and 1200 AD, the measles virus fully diverged from rinderpest, becoming a distinct virus that infects humans. This agrees with the observation that measles requires a susceptible population of over 500,000 to sustain an epidemic, a situation that occurred in historic times following the growth of medieval European cities.\nMeasles is an endemic disease, meaning it has been continually present in a community and many people develop resistance. In populations not exposed to measles, exposure to the new disease can be devastating. In 1529, a measles outbreak in Cuba killed two-thirds of those indigenous people who had previously survived smallpox. Two years later, measles was responsible for the deaths of half the population of Honduras, and it has ravaged Mexico, Central America, and the Inca civilization.\nThe 1846 measles outbreak in the Faroe Islands was unusual for being well studied. Measles had not been seen on the islands for 60 years, so almost no residents had any acquired immunity. Three-quarters of the residents got sick, and more than 100 (1\u20132%) died from it before the epidemic burned itself out. Peter Ludvig Panum observed the outbreak and determined that measles was spread through direct contact of contagious people with people who had never had measles. He elucidated the immunity conferred by illness as well as its incubation period by studying this outbreak.\nMeasles killed 20 percent of Hawaii's population in the 1850s. In 1875, measles killed over 40,000 Fijians, approximately one-third of the population. In the 19th century, the disease killed more than half of the Great Andamanese population.\nIn 1914, a statistician for the Prudential Insurance Company estimated from a survey of 22 countries that 1% of all deaths in the temperate zone were caused by measles. He observed also that 1\u20136% of cases of measles ended fatally, the difference depending on age (0\u20133 being the worst), social conditions (e.g. overcrowded tenements) and pre-existing health conditions.\nVaccination.\nPrior to the introduction of vaccines, more than 2 million deaths and 30 million cases were estimated to occur annually around the world. In 1954, John Enders and Thomas C. Peebles isolated the measles virus from a 13-year-old boy from the United States, David Edmonston. Enders was one of the researchers experienced with propagating poliovirus, paving the way for the Salk vaccine, and used similar techniques to grow the Edmonston strain in human kidney tissue, then amniotic membrane tissue culture, and finally chick embryo culture. This created a virus capable of replicating and generating immunity, but not of causing disease, a process called attenuation. While at Merck, Maurice Hilleman used the Edmonston B strain to develop the first successful measles vaccine, which became widely available in the United States in 1963. An improved measles vaccine became available in 1968. The measles vaccine was combined with the mumps vaccine and rubella vaccine, which are similar live vaccines given at the same ages, to create the MMR vaccine. It was licensed for use in the United States in 1971. The MMR vaccine was combined with the varicella vaccine to create the MMRV vaccine, which was licensed in 2005.\nSociety and culture.\nGerman anti-vaccination campaigner and HIV/AIDS denialist Stefan Lanka posed a challenge on his website in 2011, offering a sum of \u20ac100,000 for anyone who could scientifically prove that measles is caused by a virus and determine the diameter of the virus. He posited that the illness is psychosomatic and that the measles virus does not exist. When provided with overwhelming scientific evidence from various medical studies by German physician David Bardens, Lanka did not accept the findings, forcing Bardens to appeal in court. The initial legal case ended with the ruling that Lanka was to pay the prize. However, on appeal, Lanka was ultimately not required to pay the award because the submitted evidence did not meet his exact requirements. The case received wide international coverage that prompted many to comment on it, including neurologist, well-known skeptic and science-based medicine advocate Steven Novella, who called Lanka \"a crank\".\nAs outbreaks easily occur in undervaccinated populations, the disease is seen as a test of sufficient vaccination within a population. Measles outbreaks have been on the rise in the United States, especially in communities with lower rates of vaccination. A different vaccine distribution within a single territory by age or social class may define different general perceptions of vaccination efficacy. It is often introduced to a region by travelers from other countries and it typically spreads to those who have not received the measles vaccination.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

First built in the 1970s, six remain in service with the Russian Navy. Two other vessels were slated to be modernized since at least 2017 as Project 949AM, to extend their service life and increase combat capabilities but it is unclear whether work continues as of 2023.\nThe Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service until some ballistic missile submarines were converted to carry cruise missiles in 2007. They are the fourth largest class of submarines in displacement and length. Only the Soviet , Russian and American \"Ohio\"-class ballistic missile submarines are larger.\nHistory.\nThe first submarine of Project 949 was laid down in the mid-1970s and was commissioned in 1980. In 1982 an updated and larger version (Project 949A) replaced the earlier version. In total fourteen submarines were constructed. The Oscar class was designed to attack NATO carrier battle groups using long-range P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 \"Shipwreck\") anti-ship missiles and targeting data provided by the EORSAT satellite system (via the submarine's \"Punch Bowl\" antenna). In the financial problems that followed the fall of the Soviet Union the Oscar class was prioritized by the Russian Navy, and when many older submarine classes were retired the Oscar class remained active in both the Northern and Pacific Fleets.\nModernization.\nThe Rubin Design Bureau started working on Project 949A modernization in 2011, with Zvezdochka and Zvezda shipyards to carry out modernization of the vessels. In September 2015, Russian Defence Minister Sergey Shoygu announced during his visit to Zvezda shipyard, that at least three Oscar-class submarines will undergo repair and modernization to extend their service life by 20 years. The upgraded submarines will be known as \"Project 949AM\", according to the Russian officials. Modernization cost was estimated at RUB12 billion (US$182 million) per submarine.\nIn September 2016, it was reported submarines K-132 \"Irkutsk\" and K-442 \"Chelyabinsk\" are currently being modernized to 949AM. According to the Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Yury Borisov, Russia's Pacific Fleet may get four modernized Oscar II-class submarines armed with Kalibr cruise missiles by 2021.\nVersions.\nProject 949 \"Granit\" (Oscar I).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nTwo Project 949 \"Granit\" submarines were built at Severodvinsk between 1975 and 1982 and assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. \"K-525\" was laid down in 1975 and \"K-206\" was laid down in 1979. After the construction of the first two submarines, production continued with the improved project 949A \"Antey\". Both submarines of the Project 949 were decommissioned in 1996 and scrapped in 2004.\nProject 949A \"Antei\" (Oscar II).\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Stack/styles.css\"/&gt;\nEleven Project 949A \"Antey\" submarines were completed at Severodvinsk, of which five were assigned to the Soviet Northern Fleet. At one stage it had been planned to develop a new fourth-generation follow-on to the Project 949A, but this plan was later dropped. The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about longer than its predecessor (approximately rather than ), providing space and buoyancy for improved electronics and quieter propulsion.\nSome sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to early but inferior to the \"Akula II\" class as well as subsequent (4th generation) designs. It also has a larger fin, and its propellers have seven blades instead of four.\nLike all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of double hull construction. Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a bridge open to the elements on top of the sail but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station. A distinguishing mark is a slight bulge at the top of the fin. A large door on either side of the fin reaches this bulge. These are wider at the top than on the bottom, and are hinged on the bottom. The Federation of American Scientists reports that this submarine carries an emergency crew escape capsule; it is possible that these doors cover it. The VSK escape capsule can accommodate 110 people.\nProject 949AM.\nModernization of Project 949A submarines, first announced by the Russian Defence Ministry in 2011. As part of the modernization, submarines will have their 24 P-700 Granit anti-ship missiles replaced with up to 72 newer 3M-54 Kalibr or P-800 Oniks anti-ship cruise missiles. The upgrade requires no design changes to the hull as the new missiles will fit into the existing launchers outside the pressure hull. The modernized boats will also get upgraded Omnibus-M combat information and Simfoniya-3.2 navigation systems, as well as new fire-control system, communications, sonar, radar, and electronic intercept equipment. The modernization aims to bring the submarines up to the same technological level as Russia's next-generation Yasen-class nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines.\nBelgorod, Project 09852.\nIn December 2012, construction began on a special purpose research and rescue submarine, designated Project 09852, and based on the incomplete Project 949A (Oscar II class) submarine \"Belgorod\". The submarine is reportedly designed to carry both manned (e.g. Project 18511 midget submarine) as well as unmanned (e.g. Klavesin-1R) underwater vessels. However, while carrying smaller unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) would be possible as-is on an Oscar-class hull, the accommodation of a midget submarine such as Project 18511 \"Paltus\" or the even larger Project 10831 \"Losharik\", would probably require a major hull extension in order to accommodate a docking compartment. For example, the length of the submarine BS-64 \"Podmoskovye\" was increased by even though the SLBM missile compartment was completely removed.\n\"Belgorod\" will be reportedly used as a carrier of the rumored Poseidon (NATO reporting name Kanyon) nuclear-powered, thermonuclear armed unmanned underwater device capable to carry a 100 Mt thermonuclear warhead, with at least four such devices being carried horizontally in place of the 24 P-700 Granit (SS-N-19 \"Shipwreck\") launchers for a total yield of 600 megatonnes of TNT.\nIt is estimated that \"Belgorod\" will be long which would make it the longest submarine in the world.\nOn 23 April 2019, \"Belgorod\" was floated out of a slipway during a ceremony at the Sevmash shipyard, watched by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin via a TV-link. Further work was to be completed afloat and the submarine was scheduled to start its factory and state trials in 2020 after which it was to be delivered to the Russian Navy. However, this schedule was delayed with sea trials then projected to begin in May 2021. After some delays, sea trials were reported to have started on June 25, 2021. The submarine was delivered to the Russian Navy on 8 July 2022.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The French attacked the English while they were traversing northern France during the Hundred Years' War, resulting in an English victory and heavy loss of life among the French.\nThe English army had landed in the Cotentin Peninsula on 12 July. It had burnt a path of destruction through some of the richest lands in France to within of Paris, sacking many towns on the way. The English then marched north, hoping to link up with an allied Flemish army which had invaded from Flanders. Hearing that the Flemish had turned back, and having temporarily outdistanced the pursuing French, Edward had his army prepare a defensive position on a hillside near Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu. Late on 26 August the French army, which greatly outnumbered the English, attacked.\nDuring a brief archery duel a large force of French mercenary crossbowmen was routed by Welsh and English longbowmen. The French then launched a series of cavalry charges by their mounted knights. These were disordered by their impromptu nature, by having to force their way through the fleeing crossbowmen, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attacks were further broken up by the effective fire from the English archers, which caused heavy casualties. By the time the French charges reached the English men-at-arms, who had dismounted for the battle, they had lost much of their impetus. The ensuing hand-to-hand combat was described as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible.\" The French charges continued late into the night, all with the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French retreat.\nThe English then laid siege to the port of Calais. The battle crippled the French army's ability to relieve the siege; the town fell to the English the following year and remained under English rule for more than two centuries, until 1558. Cr\u00e9cy established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield.\nBackground.\nSince the Norman Conquest of 1066, English monarchs had held titles and lands within France, the possession of which made them vassals of the kings of France. Following a series of disagreements between Philip\u00a0VI of France (r.\u20091328\u00a0\u2013\u00a01350) and Edward\u00a0III of England (r.\u20091327\u00a0\u2013\u00a01377), on 24 May 1337 Philip's Great Council in Paris agreed that the lands held by Edward in France should be taken back into Philip's hands on the grounds that Edward was in breach of his obligations as a vassal. This marked the start of the Hundred Years' War, which was to last 116 years.\nThere followed eight years of intermittent but expensive and inconclusive warfare: Edward campaigned three times in northern France to no effect; Gascony was left almost entirely to its own devices and the French made significant inroads in attritional warfare. In early 1345 Edward attempted another campaign in the north; his main army sailed on 29 June and anchored off Sluys in Flanders until 22 July, while Edward attended to diplomatic affairs. When it sailed, probably intending to land in Normandy, it was scattered by a storm. There were further delays and it proved impossible to take any action with this force before winter. Meanwhile, Henry, Earl of Derby, led a whirlwind campaign through Gascony at the head of an Anglo-Gascon army. He heavily defeated two large French armies at the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, captured more than 100 French towns and fortifications in P\u00e9rigord and Agenais and gave the English possessions in Gascony strategic depth.\nIn March 1346 a French army numbering between 15,000 and 20,000, \"enormously superior\" to any force the Anglo-Gascons could field, including all the military officers of the royal household, and commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of PhilipVI, marched on Gascony. They besieged the strategically and logistically important town of Aiguillon. On 2April the \"arri\u00e8re-ban\", the formal call to arms for all able-bodied males, was announced for the south of France. French financial, logistical and manpower efforts were focused on this offensive. Derby, now Lancaster, sent an urgent appeal for help to Edward. Edward was not only morally obliged to succour his vassal but contractually required to; his indenture with Lancaster stated that if Lancaster were attacked by overwhelming numbers, then Edward \"shall rescue him in one way or another\".\nMeanwhile, Edward was raising a fresh army, and assembled more than 700 vessels to transport it \u2013 the largest English fleet ever to that date. The French were aware of Edward's efforts, and to guard against the possibility of an English landing in northern France, relied on their powerful navy. This reliance was misplaced, and the French were unable to prevent Edward successfully crossing the Channel.\nPrelude.\nThe English landed at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, Normandy, on 12 July 1346. They achieved complete strategic surprise and marched south. Edward's soldiers razed every town in their path and looted whatever they could from the populace. Caen, the cultural, political, religious and financial centre of north-west Normandy, was stormed on 26 July and subsequently looted for five days. More than 5,000 French soldiers and civilians were killed; among the few prisoners was Raoul, Count of Eu, the Constable of France. On 29 July Edward sent his fleet back to England, laden with loot, with a letter ordering that reinforcements, supplies and money be collected, embarked and loaded respectively, and sent to rendezvous with his army at Crotoy, on the north bank of the mouth of the River Somme. The English marched out towards the River Seine on 1August.\nThe French military position was difficult. Their main army, commanded by John, Duke of Normandy, the son and heir of PhilipVI, was committed to the intractable siege of Aiguillon in the south west. After his surprise landing in Normandy, Edward was devastating some of the richest land in France and flaunting his ability to march at will through France. On 2August, a small English force supported by many Flemings invaded France from Flanders; French defences there were completely inadequate. The treasury was all but empty. On 29 July, Philip proclaimed the \"arri\u00e8re-ban\" for northern France, ordering every able-bodied male to assemble at Rouen, where Philip himself arrived on the 31st. On 7August, the English reached the Seine, south of Rouen, and turned south-east. By 12 August, Edward's army was encamped at Poissy, from Paris, having left a 20-mile-wide swathe of destruction down the left bank of the Seine, burning villages to within of Paris. Philip's army marched parallel to the English on the other bank, and in turn encamped north of Paris, where it was steadily reinforced. Paris was in uproar, swollen with refugees, and preparations were made to defend the capital street by street.\nPhilip sent orders to Duke John of Normandy insisting that he abandon the siege of Aiguillon and march his army north, which after delay and vacillation he did on 20 August \u2013 though he would ultimately not arrive in time to change the course of events in the north. The French army outside Paris consisted of some 8,000 men-at-arms, 6,000 crossbowmen, and many infantry levies. Philip sent a challenge on 14 August suggesting that the two armies do battle at a mutually agreed time and place in the area. Edward indicated that he would meet Philip to the south of the Seine, without actually committing himself. On 16 August the French moved into position; Edward promptly burnt down Poissy, destroyed the bridge there, and marched north.\nThe French had carried out a scorched earth policy, carrying away all stores of food and so forcing the English to spread out over a wide area to forage, which greatly slowed them. Bands of French peasants attacked some of the smaller groups of foragers. Philip reached the River Somme a day's march ahead of Edward. He based himself at Amiens and sent large detachments to hold every bridge and ford across the Somme between Amiens and the sea. The English were now trapped in an area which had been stripped of food. The French moved out of Amiens and advanced westwards, towards the English. They were now willing to give battle, knowing they would have the advantage of standing on the defensive while the English were forced to try to fight their way past them.\nEdward was determined to break the French blockade of the Somme and probed at several points, vainly attacking Hangest and Pont-Remy before moving west along the river. English supplies were running out and the army was ragged, starving and beginning to suffer from a drop in morale. On the evening of 24 August the English were encamped north of Acheux while the French were away at Abbeville. During the night the English marched on a tidal ford named Blanchetaque. The far bank was defended by a force of 3,500 French. English longbowmen and mounted men-at-arms waded into the tidal river and after a short, sharp fight routed the French. The main French army had followed the English, and their scouts captured some stragglers and several wagons, but Edward had broken free of immediate pursuit. Such was the French confidence that Edward would not ford the Somme that the area beyond had not been denuded, allowing Edward's army to plunder it and resupply.\nMeanwhile, the Flemings, having been rebuffed by the French at Estaires, besieged B\u00e9thune on 14 August. After several setbacks they fell out among themselves, burnt their siege equipment and gave up their expedition on 24 August. Edward received the news that he would not be reinforced by the Flemings shortly after crossing the Somme. The ships which were expected to be waiting off Crotoy were nowhere to be seen. Edward decided to engage Philip's army with the force he had. Having temporarily shaken off the French pursuit, he used the respite to prepare a defensive position at Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu. The French returned to Abbeville, crossed the Somme at the bridge there, and doggedly set off after the English again.\nOpposing forces.\nEnglish army.\nThe English army comprised almost exclusively English and Welsh soldiers, along with a handful of Normans disaffected with Philip VI and a few German mercenaries, the foreigners constituting probably no more than 150 in number. The exact size and composition of the English force is not known. Contemporary estimates vary widely; for example Froissart's third version of his \"Chronicles\" more than doubles his estimate in the first. Modern historians have estimated its size as from 7,000 to 15,000. Andrew Ayton suggests a figure of around 14,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 5,000 longbowmen, 3,000 hobelars (light cavalry and mounted archers) and 3,500 spearmen. Clifford Rogers suggests 15,000: 2,500 men-at-arms, 7,000 longbowmen, 3,250 hobelars and 2,300 spearmen. Jonathan Sumption, going by the carrying capacity of its original transport fleet, believes the force was around 7,000 to 10,000. Up to a thousand men were convicted felons serving on the promise of a pardon at the end of the campaign. Many of the English, including many of the felons, were veterans; perhaps as many as half.\nThe men-at-arms of both armies wore a quilted gambeson under mail armour which covered the body and limbs. This was supplemented by varying amounts of plate armour on the body and limbs, more so for wealthier and more experienced men. Heads were protected by bascinets: open-faced iron or steel helmets, with mail attached to the lower edge of the helmet to protect the throat, neck and shoulders. A moveable visor (face guard) protected the face. Heater shields, typically made from thin wood overlaid with leather, were carried. The English men-at-arms were all dismounted. The weapons they used are not recorded, but in similar battles they used their lances as pikes, cut them down to use as short spears, or fought with swords and battle axes.\nThe longbow used by the English and Welsh archers was unique to them; it took up to ten years to master and could discharge up to ten arrows per minute well over . A computer analysis in 2017 by Warsaw University of Technology demonstrated that heavy bodkin point arrows could penetrate typical plate armour of the time at . The depth of penetration would be slight at that range; predicted penetration increased as the range closed or against armour of less than the best quality available at the time. Contemporary sources speak of arrows frequently piercing armour. Archers carried one quiver of 24 arrows as standard. During the morning of the battle, they were each issued two more quivers, for a total of 72 arrows per man. This was sufficient for perhaps fifteen minutes' shooting at the maximum rate, although as the battle wore on the rate would slow. Regular resupply of ammunition would be required from the wagons to the rear; the archers would also venture forward during pauses in the fighting to retrieve arrows. Modern historians suggest that half a million arrows could have been shot during the battle.\nThe English army was also equipped with several types of gunpowder weapons, in unknown numbers: small guns firing lead balls; ribauldequins firing either metal arrows or grapeshot; and bombards, an early form of cannon firing metal balls in diameter. Contemporary accounts and modern historians differ as to what types of these weapons and how many were present at Cr\u00e9cy, but several iron balls compatible with the bombard ammunition have since been retrieved from the site of the battle.\nFrench army.\nThe exact size of the French army is even less certain, as the financial records from the Cr\u00e9cy campaign are lost, although there is consensus that it was substantially larger than the English. Contemporary chroniclers all note it as being extremely large for the period. The two who provide totals estimate its size as 72,000 or 120,000. The numbers of mounted men-at-arms are given as either 12,000 or 20,000. An Italian chronicler claimed 100,000 knights (men-at-arms), 12,000 infantry and 5,000 crossbowmen. Contemporary chroniclers estimated the crossbowmen present as between 2,000 and 20,000.\nThese numbers are described by historians as exaggerated and unrealistic, on the basis of the extant war treasury records for 1340, six years before the battle. Clifford Rogers estimates \"the French host was at least twice as large as the [English], and perhaps as much as three times.\" According to modern estimates, 8,000 mounted men-at-arms formed the core of the French army, supported by two to six thousand mercenary crossbowmen recruited by and hired from the major trading city of Genoa, and a \"large, though indeterminate, number of common infantry\". How many common infantrymen, militia and levies of variable levels of equipment and training, were present is not known with any certainty, except that on their own they outnumbered the English army.\nThe French men-at-arms were equipped similarly to the English. They were mounted on entirely unarmoured horses and carried wooden lances, usually ash, tipped with iron and approximately long. Many of the men-at-arms in the French army were foreigners: many joined individually out of a spirit of adventure and the attractive rates of pay offered. Others were in contingents contributed by Philip's allies: three kings, a prince-bishop, a duke and three counts led entourages from non-French territories.\nSince Philip came to the throne, French armies had included an increasing proportion of crossbowmen. As there were few archers in France, they were usually recruited from abroad, typically Genoa; their foreign origin led to them frequently being labelled mercenaries. They were professional soldiers and in battle were protected from missiles by pavises\u00a0\u2013 very large shields with their own bearers, behind each of which three crossbowmen could shelter. A trained crossbowman could shoot his weapon approximately twice a minute to a shorter effective range than a longbowman of about .\nInitial deployments.\nEdward deployed his army in a carefully selected position, facing south east on a sloping hillside, broken by copses and terracing, at Cr\u00e9cy-en-Ponthieu. This was in an area which Edward had inherited from his mother and well known to several of the English; it has been suggested that the position had long been considered a suitable site for a battle. The left flank was anchored against Wadicourt, while the right was protected by Cr\u00e9cy itself and the River Maye beyond. This made it difficult for the French to outflank them. The position had a ready line of retreat in the event that the English were defeated or put under intolerable pressure. While waiting for the French to catch up with them, the English dug pits in front of their positions, intended to disorder attacking cavalry, and set up several primitive gunpowder weapons. Edward wished to provoke the French into a mounted charge uphill against his solid infantry formations of dismounted men-at-arms, backed by Welsh spearmen and flanked by archers. The army had been in position since dawn, and so was rested and well-fed, giving them an advantage over the French, who did not rest before the battle. Having decisively defeated a large French detachment two days before, the English troops' morale was high.\nThe English army was divided into three battalions, or \"battles\", deployed in a column. The King's son, Edward, Prince of Wales, aided by the earls of Northampton and Warwick (the 'constable' and 'marshal' of the army, respectively), commanded the vanguard with 800 men-at-arms, 2,000 archers and 1,000 foot soldiers including Welsh spearmen. To its left, the other battle was led by the Earl of Arundel, with 800 men-at-arms and 1,200 archers. Behind them, the King commanded the reserve battle, with 700 men-at-arms and 2,000 archers. Each division was composed of men-at-arms in the centre, all on foot, with ranks of spearmen immediately behind them, and with longbowmen on each flank and in a skirmish line to their front. Many of the longbowmen were concealed in small woods, or by lying down in ripe wheat. The baggage train was positioned to the rear of the whole army, where it was circled and fortified, to serve as a park for the horses, a defence against any possible attack from the rear and a rallying point in the event of defeat.\nAround noon on 26 August French scouts, advancing north from Abbeville, came in sight of the English. The crossbowmen, under Antonio Doria and Carlo Grimaldi, formed the French vanguard. Following was a large battle of mounted men-at-arms led by Count Charles of Alen\u00e7on, Philip's brother, accompanied by the blind King John of Bohemia. The next battle was led by Duke Rudolph of Lorraine and Count Louis of Blois, while Philip commanded the rearguard. As news filtered back that the English had turned to fight, the French contingents sped up, jostling with each other to reach the front of the column. The Italians stayed in the van, while the mounted men-at-arms left their accompanying infantry and wagons behind. Discipline was lost; the French were hampered by the absence of their Constable, who was normally responsible for marshalling and leading their army, but who had been captured at Caen. Once it halted, men, especially infantry, were continually joining Philip's battle as they marched north west from Abbeville.\nAfter reconnoitring the English position, a council of war was held where the senior French officials, who were completely confident of victory, advised an attack, but not until the next day. The army was tired from a 12-mile march, and needed to reorganise so as to be able to attack in strength. It was also known that the Count of Savoy, with more than 500 men-at-arms, was marching to join the French and was nearby. (He intercepted some of the French survivors the day after the battle). Despite this advice, the French attacked later the same afternoon; it is unclear from the contemporary sources whether this was a deliberate choice by Philip, or because too many of the French knights kept pressing forward and the battle commenced against his wishes. Philip's plan was to use the long-range missiles of his crossbowmen to soften up the English infantry and disorder, and possibly dishearten, their formations, so as to allow the accompanying mounted men-at-arms to break into their ranks and rout them. Modern historians have generally considered this to have been a practical approach, and one with proven success against other armies.\nBattle.\nArchery duel.\nThe French army moved forward late in the afternoon, unfurling their sacred battle banner, the \"oriflamme\", indicating that no prisoners would be taken. As they advanced, a sudden rainstorm broke over the field. The English archers de-strung their bows to avoid the strings becoming slackened. A contemporary account, followed by some modern historians, has the rain weakening the Genoese crossbows' strings, reducing their power and range; other modern historians state that their bowstrings were protected by leather coverings and so the Genoese were as unaffected by the storm as the English archers.\nThe Genoese engaged the English longbowmen in an archery duel. The longbowmen outranged their opponents and had a rate of fire more than three times greater. The crossbowmen were also without their protective pavises, which were still with the French baggage, as were their reserve supplies of ammunition. The mud also impeded their ability to reload, which required them to press the stirrups of their weapons into the ground, and thus slowed their rate of fire.\nThe Italians were rapidly defeated and fled; aware of their vulnerability without their pavises, they may have made only a token effort. Modern historians disagree as to how many casualties they suffered; some contemporary sources suggest they may have failed to get off any shots at all, while a recent specialist study of this duel concludes that they hastily shot perhaps two volleys, then withdrew before any real exchange with the English could develop. Italian casualties in this phase of the battle were probably light.\nThe knights and nobles following in Alen\u00e7on's division, hampered by the routed mercenaries, hacked at them as they retreated. By most contemporary accounts the crossbowmen were considered cowards at best and more likely traitors, and many of them were killed by the French. The clash of the retreating Genoese and the advancing French cavalry threw the leading battle into disarray. The longbowmen continued to shoot into the massed troops. The discharge of the English bombards added to the confusion, though contemporary accounts differ as to whether they inflicted significant casualties.\nCavalry charges.\nAlen\u00e7on's battle (division of the army) then launched a cavalry charge. This was disordered by its impromptu nature, by having to force its way through the fleeing Italians, by the muddy ground, by having to charge uphill, and by the pits dug by the English. The attack was further broken up by the heavy and effective shooting from the English archers, which caused many casualties. It is likely the archers preserved their ammunition until they had a reasonable chance of penetrating the French armour, which would be at a range of about . The armoured French riders had some protection, but their horses were completely unarmoured and were killed or wounded in large numbers. Disabled horses fell, spilling or trapping their riders and causing following ranks to swerve to avoid them and fall into even further disorder. Wounded horses fled across the hillside in panic. By the time the tight formation of English men-at-arms and spearmen received the French charge it had lost much of its impetus.\nA contemporary described the hand-to-hand combat which ensued as \"murderous, without pity, cruel, and very horrible.\" Men-at-arms who lost their footing, or who were thrown from wounded horses, were trampled underfoot, crushed by falling horses and bodies and suffocated in the mud. After the battle, many French bodies were recovered with no marks on them. Alen\u00e7on was among those killed. The French attack was beaten off. English infantry moved forward to knife the French wounded, loot the bodies and recover arrows. Some sources say Edward had given orders that, contrary to custom, no prisoners be taken; outnumbered as he was he did not want to lose fighting men to escorting and guarding captives. In any event, there is no record of any prisoners being taken until the next day, after the battle.\nFresh forces of French cavalry moved into position at the foot of the hill and repeated Alen\u00e7on's charge. They had the same problems as Alen\u00e7on's force, with the added disadvantage that the ground they were advancing over was littered with dead and wounded horses and men. Ayton and Preston write of \"long mounds of fallen warhorses and men\u00a0... add[ing] significantly to the difficulties facing fresh formations\u00a0... as they sought to approach the English position.\" Nevertheless, they charged home, albeit in such a disordered state that they were again unable to break into the English formation. A prolonged m\u00eal\u00e9e resulted, with a report that at one point the Prince of Wales was beaten to his knees. One account has the Prince's standard-bearer standing on his banner to prevent its capture. A modern historian has described the fighting as \"horrific carnage\". Edward sent forward a detachment from his reserve battle to rescue the situation. The French were again repulsed. They came again. The English ranks were thinned, but those in the rear stepped forward to fill the gaps.\nHow many times the French charged is disputed, but they continued late into the night, with the dusk and then dark disorganising the French yet further. All had the same result: fierce fighting followed by a French retreat. In one attack the Count of Blois dismounted his men and had them advance on foot; the Count's body was found on the field. The French nobility stubbornly refused to yield. There was no lack of courage on either side. Famously, blind King John of Bohemia tied his horse's bridle to those of his attendants and galloped into the twilight; all were dragged from their horses and killed. There are accounts of entire English battles advancing on occasion to clear away broken French charges milling in front of them, then withdrawing in good order to their original positions.\nPhilip himself was caught up in the fighting, had two horses killed under him, and received an arrow in the jaw. The bearer of the \"oriflamme\" was a particular target for the English archers; he was seen to fall but survived, albeit abandoning the sacred banner to be captured. Finally, Philip abandoned the field of battle, although it is unclear why. It was nearly midnight and the battle petered out, with the majority of the French army melting away from the battlefield. The English slept where they had fought. The next morning substantial French forces were still arriving on the battlefield, to be charged by the English men-at-arms, now mounted, routed and pursued for miles. Their losses alone were reported as several thousand, including the Duke of Lorraine. Meanwhile, a few wounded or stunned Frenchmen were pulled from the heaps of dead men and dying horses and taken prisoner.\nCasualties.\nThe losses in the battle were highly asymmetrical. All contemporary sources agree that English casualties were very low. It was reported that English deaths comprised three or four men-at-arms and a small number of the rank and file, for a total of forty according to a roll-call after the battle. It has been suggested by some modern historians that this is too few and that English deaths might have numbered around three hundred. To date, only two Englishmen killed at the battle have been identified; two English knights were also taken prisoner, although it is unclear at what stage in the battle this happened.\nThe French casualties are considered to have been very high. According to a count made by the English heralds after the battle, the bodies of 1,542 French noble men-at-arms were found (perhaps not including the hundreds who died in the clash of the following day). More than 2,200 heraldic coats were reportedly taken from the field of battle as war booty by the English. No such count was made of the lower-born foot soldiers, as their equipment was not worth looting. No reliable figures exist for losses among them, although their casualties were also considered to have been heavy, and a large number were said to have been wounded with arrows. The dead on the second day of battle alone were said to have been exceptionally numerous, with estimates varying from 2,000 to, according to EdwardIII himself, 4,000.\nA disproportionate number of magnates featured among the slain on the French side, including one king (John of Bohemia), nine princes, ten counts, a duke, an archbishop and a bishop. According to Ayton, these heavy losses can also be attributed to the chivalric ideals held by knights of the time, since nobles would have preferred to die in battle, rather than dishonourably flee the field, especially in view of their fellow knights.\nNo reliable figures exist for losses among the common French soldiery, although they were also considered to have been heavy. Jean Le Bel estimated 15,000\u201316,000. Froissart writes that the French army suffered a total of 30,000 killed or captured. The modern historian Alfred Burne estimates 10,000 infantry, as \"a pure guess\", for a total of 12,000 French dead.\nAftermath.\nThe result of the battle is described by Clifford Rogers as \"a total victory for the English\", and by Ayton as \"unprecedented\" and \"a devastating military humiliation\" for the French. Sumption considers it \"a political catastrophe for the French Crown\". The battle was reported to the English parliament on 13 September in glowing terms as a sign of divine favour and justification for the huge cost of the war to date. A contemporary chronicler opined \"By haste and disorganisation were the French destroyed.\" Rogers writes that, among other factors, the English \"benefitted from superior organisation, cohesion and leadership\" and from \"the indiscipline of the French\". According to Ayton \"England's international reputation as a military power was established in an evening's hard fighting.\"\nEdward ended the campaign by laying siege to Calais, which fell after eleven months, the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy having crippled the French army's ability to relieve the town. This secured an English entrep\u00f4t into northern France which was held for two hundred years. The battle established the effectiveness of the longbow as a dominant weapon on the Western European battlefield. English and Welsh archers served as mercenaries in Italy in significant numbers, and some as far afield as Hungary. Modern historian Joseph Dahmus includes the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy in his \"Seven Decisive Battles of the Middle Ages\".\nNotes, citations and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\nModern sources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He died before his father and so his son, Richard II, succeeded to the throne instead. Nevertheless, Edward earned distinction as one of the most successful English commanders during the Hundred Years' War, being regarded by his English contemporaries as a model of chivalry and one of the greatest knights of his age. Edward was made Duke of Cornwall, the first English dukedom, in 1337. He was guardian of the kingdom in his father's absence in 1338, 1340, and 1342. He was created Prince of Wales in 1343 and knighted by his father at La Hougue in 1346.\nIn 1346, Prince Edward commanded the vanguard at the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, his father intentionally leaving him to win the battle. He took part in Edward III's 1349 Calais expedition. In 1355, he was appointed the king's lieutenant in Gascony and ordered to lead an army into Aquitaine on a chevauch\u00e9e, during which he pillaged Avignonet and Castelnaudary, sacked Carcassonne, and plundered Narbonne. In 1356, on another chevauch\u00e9e, he ravaged Auvergne, Limousin, and Berry but failed to take Bourges. The forces of King John II of France met Edward's armies near the city of Poitiers. After negotiations between the two sides broke down, the Anglo-Gascon forces under Edward routed the French army and captured King John at the Battle of Poitiers.\nIn 1360, he negotiated the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny. He was created Prince of Aquitaine and Gascony in 1362, but his suzerainty was not recognised by the lord of Albret or other Gascon nobles. He was directed by his father to forbid the marauding raids of the English and Gascon free companies in 1364. He entered into an agreement with Kings Peter of Castile and Charles II of Navarre, by which Peter covenanted to mortgage Castro Urdiales and the province of Biscay to him as security for a loan; in 1366 a passage was secured through Navarre. In 1367, he received a letter of defiance from Henry of Trast\u00e1mara, Peter's half-brother and rival. The same year, after an obstinate conflict, he defeated Henry at the Battle of N\u00e1jera. However, after a wait of several months during which he failed to obtain either the province of Biscay or liquidation of the debt from Don Pedro, he returned to Aquitaine. Edward persuaded the estates of Aquitaine to allow him a hearth tax of ten sous for five years in 1368, thereby alienating the lord of Albret and other nobles.\nPrince Edward returned to England in 1371 and resigned the principality of Aquitaine and Gascony in 1372. He led the Commons in their attack upon the Lancastrian administration in 1376. He died in 1376 of dysentery and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral, where his surcoat, helmet, shield, and gauntlets are still preserved.\nEarly life (1330\u20131343).\nEdward\u2014the eldest son of Edward III of England, Lord of Ireland and ruler of Gascony, and Queen Philippa\u2014was born at Woodstock, Oxfordshire, on 15 June 1330. On 10 September Edward III allowed five hundred marks per year from the profits of the county of Chester for his son's maintenance; on 25 February 1331, the whole of these profits were assigned to the queen for maintaining Edward and the king's sister Eleanor. In July 1331 the king proposed to marry Edward to a daughter of Philip VI of France.\nTensions between England and France reached a breaking point during the reign of Edward III. Disputes over English lands in France, feudal obligations due to king Philip IV of France, and Edward III's claim to the French throne culminated in Edward declaring war on France in 1337, beginning the first phase of the Hundred Years' War.\nOn 18 March 1333, Prince Edward was invested with the earldom and county of Chester, and in the parliament of 9 February 1337 he was created duke of Cornwall and received the duchy by charter dated 17 March. This is the earliest instance of the creation of a duke in England. By the terms of the charter the duchy was to be held by Edward and the eldest sons of kings of England. His tutor was Dr. Walter Burley of Merton College, Oxford. His revenues were placed at the disposal of his mother in March 1334 for the expenses she incurred in bringing up him and his two sisters, Isabella and Joan. Rumours of an impending French invasion led the king in August 1335 to order that he and his household should remove to Nottingham Castle as a place of safety.\nWhen two cardinals came to England at the end of 1337 to make peace between Edward III and Philip VI, Prince Edward reportedly met the cardinals outside the City of London and, in company with many nobles, conducted them to Edward III. On 11 July 1338 his father, who was on the point of leaving England to campaign in the Low Countries, appointed him guardian of the kingdom during his absence, and he was appointed to the same office on 27 May 1340 and 6 October 1342; he was, of course, too young to take any save a nominal part in the administration, which was carried on by the council. To attach John III, Duke of Brabant, to his cause, the king in 1339 proposed a marriage between Edward and John's daughter Margaret, and in the spring of 1345 wrote urgently to Pope Clement VI for a dispensation for the marriage.\nOn 12 May 1343, Edward III created Edward Prince of Wales in a parliament held at Westminster, investing Edward with a circlet, gold ring, and silver rod. Edward accompanied his father to Sluys on 3 July 1345, and the king tried to persuade the burgomasters of Ghent, Bruges and Ypres to accept his son as their lord, but the murder of Jacob van Artevelde put an end to this project. Both in September 1345 and in April 1346, Edward was called on to furnish troops from his principality and earldom for the impending campaign in France, and as he incurred heavy debts in the king's service, his father authorised him to make his will and provided that, in case he fell in the war, his executors should have all his revenue for a year.\nEarly campaigns (1346\u201353).\nBattle of Cr\u00e9cy.\nEdward, Prince of Wales, sailed with King Edward III on 11 July 1346, and as soon as he landed at La Hougue he received knighthood from his father in the local church of Quettehou. Then, in the words of his biographer Chandos Herald, he \"made a right good beginning\", for he rode through the Cotentin, burning and ravaging as he went. Edward distinguished himself at the taking of Caen and in the Battle of Blanchetaque with the force under Sir Godemar I du Fay, which endeavoured to prevent the English army from crossing the Somme.\nEarly on 26 August 1346, before the start of the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy, Edward received the sacrament with his father at Cr\u00e9cy, and took the command of the right, or van, of the army with the earls of Warwick and Oxford, Sir Geoffroy d'Harcourt, Sir John Chandos, and other leaders, commanding 800 men-at-arms, 2,000 archers, and 1,000 Welsh foot soldiers, though the numbers are by no means trustworthy. When the Genoese bowmen were discomfited and the front line of the French was in some disorder, Edward apparently left his position to attack their second line. At this moment, however, the Count of Alen\u00e7on charged his division with such fury that Edward was in great danger, and the leaders who commanded with him sent a messenger to tell Edward III that he was in great straits and to beg for assistance. When Edward III learned that his son was not wounded, he responded that he would send no help, for he wished to give Edward the opportunity to \"win his spurs\" (he was in fact already a knight), and to allow him and those who had charge of him the honour of the victory. Edward was thrown to the ground and was rescued by Sir Richard Fitz-Simon, his standard-bearer, who threw down the banner, stood over his body, and beat back his assailants while he regained his feet. Harcourt sent to Earl of Arundel for help, and he forced back the French, who had probably by this time advanced to the rising ground of the English position.\nA flank attack on the side of Wadicourt was next made by the Counts of Alen\u00e7on and Ponthieu, but the English were strongly entrenched there, and the French were unable to penetrate the defences and lost the Duke of Lorraine and the Counts of Alen\u00e7on and Blois. The two front lines of their army were utterly broken before King Philip's division engaged. Then Edward III appears to have advanced at the head of the reserve, and the rout soon became complete. When Edward III met his son after the battle was over, he embraced him and declared that he had acquitted himself loyally, and Edward bowed low and did reverence to his father. The next day he joined the king in paying funeral honours to King John of Bohemia.\nEdward was present at the siege of Calais (1346\u20131347), and after the surrender of the town harried and burned the country for around, and he brought much booty back with him. He returned to England with his father on 12 October 1347, took part in the jousts and other festivities of the court, and was invested by the king with the new Order of the Garter in 1348.\nSiege of Calais and Battle of Winchelsea.\nPrince Edward shared in the king's expedition to Calais in the last days of 1349, came to the rescue of his father, and when the combat was over and the king and his prisoners sat down to feast, he and the other English knights served the king and his guests at the first course and then sat down for the second course at another table. When the king embarked at Winchelsea on 28 August 1350 to intercept the fleet of La Cerda, the Prince sailed with him, though in another ship, and in company with his brother, the young John of Gaunt, Earl of Richmond. During the Battle of Winchelsea his ship was grappled by a large Spanish ship and was so full of leaks that it was likely to sink, and though he and his knights attacked the enemy manfully, they were unable to take her. Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Lancaster, came to his rescue and attacked the Spaniard on the other side; she was soon taken, her crew were thrown into the sea, and as the Prince and his men got on board her their own ship foundered.\nCheshire expedition.\nIn 1353 some disturbances seem to have broken out in Cheshire, for the Prince as Earl of Chester marched with Henry of Grosmont, now Duke of Lancaster, to the neighbourhood of Chester to protect the justices, who were holding an assize there. The men of the earldom offered to pay him a heavy fine to bring the assize to an end, but when they thought they had arranged matters the justices opened an inquisition of trailbaston, took a large sum of money from them, and seized many houses and much land into the prince's, their earl's, hands. On his return from Chester the prince is said to have passed by the Abbey of Dieulacres in Staffordshire, to have seen a fine church which his great-grandfather, Edward I, had built there, and to have granted five hundred marks, a tenth of the sum he had taken from his earldom, towards its completion; the abbey was almost certainly not Dieulacres but Vale Royal.\nFurther campaigns (1355\u201364).\nAquitaine.\nWhen Edward III determined to renew the war with France in 1355, he ordered Edward to lead an army into Aquitaine while he acted with the king of Navarre in Normandy, and the Duke of Lancaster upheld the cause of John of Montfort in Brittany. Edward's expedition was made in accordance with the request of some of the Gascon lords who were anxious for plunder. On 10 July the king appointed Prince Edward his lieutenant in Gascony and gave Edward powers to act in his stead and to receive homages. Edward left London for Plymouth on 30 June, was detained there by contrary winds, and set sail on 8 September with about 300 ships, in company with four earls (Thomas Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, William Ufford, Earl of Suffolk, William Montagu, Earl of Salisbury, and John Vere, Earl of Oxford) and in command of 1,000 men-at-arms, 2,000 archers, and a large body of Welsh foot soldiers. At Bordeaux the Gascon lords received him with much rejoicing. It was decided to make a short campaign before the winter, and on 10 October he set out with 1,500 lances, 2,000 archers, and 3,000 light foot. Whatever scheme of operations the king may have formed during the summer, this expedition of Edward was purely a piece of marauding. After grievously harrying the counties of Juliac, Armagnac, Astarac, and part of Comminges, he crossed the Garonne at Sainte-Marie a little above Toulouse, which was occupied by John I, Count of Armagnac, and a considerable force. The count refused to allow the garrison to make a sally, and Edward passed on into the Lauragais. His troops stormed and burnt Montgiscard, where many men, women, and children were ill-treated and slain, and took and pillaged Avignonet and Castelnaudary. The country was \"very rich and fertile\" according to Edward, and the people \"good, simple, and ignorant of war\", so the prince took great spoil, especially of carpets, draperies, and jewels, for \"the robbers\" spared nothing, and the Gascons who marched with him were especially greedy. The only castle to resist the English forces was Montgey. Its ch\u00e2telaine defended its walls by pouring beehives onto the attackers, who fled in panic.\nCarcassonne was taken and sacked, but Edward did not take the citadel which was strongly situated and fortified. Ourmes (or Homps, near Narbonne) and Tr\u00e8bes bought off his army. He plundered Narbonne and thought of attacking the citadel, for he heard that there was much booty there, but he gave up the idea on finding that it was well defended. While there a messenger came to him from the papal court, urging him to allow negotiations for peace. He replied that he could do nothing without knowing his father's will. From Narbonne he turned to march back to Bordeaux. The Count of Armagnac tried to intercept him, but a small body of French having been defeated in a skirmish near Toulouse the rest of the army retreated into the city, and the prince returned in peace to Bordeaux, bringing back with him enormous spoils. The expedition lasted eight weeks, during which the prince only rested eleven days in all the places he visited, and without performing any feat of arms did the French king much mischief. During the next month, before 21 January 1356, the leaders under his command reduced five towns and seventeen castles.\nBattle of Poitiers.\nOn 6 July 1356 Edward set out on another expedition, undertaken with the intention of passing through France to Normandy and there giving aid to his father's Norman allies, the party headed by the king of Navarre and Geoffrey d'Harcourt. In Normandy he expected to be met by his father. He crossed the Dordogne at Bergerac on 4 August and rode through Auvergne, Limousin, and Berry, plundering and burning as he went until he came to Bourges, where he burnt the suburbs but failed to take the city. He then turned westward and made an unsuccessful attack on Issoudun on 25\u201327 August. Meanwhile, King John II was gathering a large force at Chartres, from which he was able to defend the passages of the Loire, and was sending troops to the fortresses that seemed in danger of attack. From Issoudun Edward returned to his former line of march and took Vierzon. There he learnt that it would be impossible for him to cross the Loire or to form a junction with Lancaster, who was then in Brittany. Accordingly he determined to return to Bordeaux by way of Poitiers, and after putting to death most of the garrison of the castle of Vierzon he set out on 29 August towards Romorantin.\nSome French knights who skirmished with the English advanced guard retreated into Romorantin, and when Prince Edward heard of this he said: \"Let us go there; I should like to see them a little nearer\". He inspected the fortress in person and sent his friend Chandos to summon the garrison to surrender. The place was defended by Boucicault and other leaders, and on their refusing his summons he assaulted it on 31 August. The siege lasted three days, and the prince, who was enraged at the death of one of his friends, declared that he would not leave the place untaken. Finally he set fire to the roofs of the fortress by using Greek fire, reduced it on 3 September.\nOn 5 September Edward proceeded to march through Berry. On 9 September King John II, who had gathered a large force, crossed the Loire at Blois and went in pursuit of them. When the king was at Loches on 12 September he had as many as 20,000 men-at-arms, and with these and his other forces he advanced to Chauvigny. On 16 and 17 September his army crossed the Vienne. Meanwhile, Edward was marching almost parallel to the French and at only a few miles distance from them. From 14 to 16 September he was at Ch\u00e2tellerault, and 17 September as he was marching towards Poitiers, some French men-at-arms skirmished with his advance guard, pursued them up to the main body of his army, and were all slain or taken prisoners. The French king had outstripped him, and his retreat was cut off by an army at least 50,000 strong, while Edward he about 7,500 men. Lancaster had endeavoured to come to his relief but had been stopped by the French at Pont-de-C\u00e9.\nWhen Prince Edward knew that the French army lay between him and Poitiers, he took up his position on some rising ground to the south-east of the city in the commune of Beauvoir and remained there that night. On 18 September Cardinal H\u00e9lie Talleyrand endeavoured to make peace. Edward was willing to come to terms and offered to give up all the towns and castles he had conquered, to set free all his prisoners, and not to serve against the king of France for seven years, besides, it is said, offering a payment of 100,000 francs. King John, however, was persuaded to demand that Edward and 100 of his knights should surrender themselves as prisoners, and to this Edward would not consent. The cardinal's negotiations lasted the whole day and were protracted in the interest of the French, for John was anxious to give time for further reinforcements to join his army. Considering the position of Edward, it seems probable that the French might have destroyed his army by hemming it in with a portion of their host, and so either starving it or forcing it to leave its strong station and fight in the open with the certainty of defeat. John made a mistake in allowing Edward respite during the negotiations, during which he employed his army in strengthening its position. The English front was well covered by vines and hedges; on its left and rear was the ravine of the Miausson river and a good deal of broken ground, and its right was flanked by the wood and abbey of Nouaill\u00e9. All through the day the army was busily engaged in digging trenches and making fences, so that it stood, as at Cr\u00e9cy, in a kind of entrenched camp.\nPrince Edward drew up his men in three divisions, the first being commanded by the earls of Warwick and Suffolk, the second by himself, and the rear by Salisbury and Oxford. The French were drawn up in four divisions, one behind the other, and so lost much of the advantage of their superior numbers. In front of his first line and on either side of the narrow lane that led to his position the prince stationed his archers, who were well protected by hedges, and detached a force of 300 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers who were to fall on the flank of the second enemy division, commanded by the Dauphin, Charles, Duke of Normandy.\nAt daybreak on 19 September Prince Edward addressed his army, and the fight began. An attempt was made by 300 picked men-at-arms to ride through the narrow lane and force the English position, but they were shot down by the archers. A body of Germans and the first division of the army which followed were thrown into disorder; then the English force in ambush charged the second division on the flank, and as it began to waver the English men-at-arms mounted their horses, which they had kept near them, and charged down the hill. Edward kept Chandos by his side, and his friend did him good service in the fray. As they prepared to charge he cried: \"John, get forward; you shall not see me turn my back this day, but I will be ever with the foremost\", and then he shouted to his banner-bearer, \"Banner, advance, in the name of God and St. George!\". All the French except the advance guard fought on foot, and the division of the Duke of Normandy, already wavering, could not stand against the English charge and fled in disorder. The next division, under Philip, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, also fled, but the rear under King John did not break. The combat lasted until a little after 3\u00a0pm. The French forces were fully routed and left 11,000 dead on the field, of whom 2,426 were men of gentle birth. Nearly 100 counts, barons, and bannerets, as well as 2,000 men-at-arms were made prisoners, and the king and his youngest son Philip were among those who were taken. The English losses were not large.\nWhen King John was brought to him, Edward received him with respect, helped him to take off his armour, and entertained him and the greater part of the princes and barons who had been made prisoners at supper. He served at the king's table and would not sit down with him, declaring that \"he was not worthy to sit at table with so great a king or so valiant a man,\" and spoke many comforting words to the king, for which the French praised him highly. The next day Edward continued his retreat towards Bordeaux; he marched carefully, but his armies were unharrased.\nAt Bordeaux, which Prince Edward reached on 2 October, he was received with much rejoicing, and he and his men wintered there. The contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart records that the prince and his retinue wasted a large part of the gold and silver they had gathered in their campaign in feasts and merriment. On 23 March 1357 Edward concluded a two years' truce, for he wished to return home. The Gascon lords were unwilling to see King John should be carried off to England, and the prince gave them 100,000 crowns to silence their murmurs. He left the country under the government of four Gascon lords and arrived in England on 4 May, landing at Plymouth. He entered London in triumph on 24 May with King John as his prisoner.\nEngland, tournaments and debts.\nAfter his return to England, Prince Edward took part in the many festivals and tournaments of his father's court, and in May 1359 he, the king, and other challengers held the lists at a joust proclaimed at London by the mayor and sheriffs, and, to the great delight of the citizens, the king appeared as the mayor and the prince as the senior sheriff. Festivities of this sort and the lavish gifts he bestowed on his friends brought him into debt, and on 27 August, when a new expedition into France was being prepared, the king granted that if he fell his executors should have his whole estate for four years for the payment of his debts.\nReims campaign.\nIn October 1359 Prince Edward sailed with his father to Calais and led a division of the army during the Reims campaign. At its close he took the principal part on the English side in negotiating the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny, and the preliminary truce arranged at Chartres on 7 May 1360 was drawn up by proctors acting in his name and the name of Charles, Duke of Normandy, the regent of France. He probably did not return to England until after his father, who landed at Rye on 18 May. On 9 July he and Henry, Duke of Lancaster, landed at Calais in attendance on the French king. As, however, the stipulated instalment of the king's ransom was not ready, he returned to England, leaving King John in the charge of Sir Walter Manny and three other knights. He accompanied his father to Calais on 9 October to assist at the liberation of King John and the ratification of the treaty. He rode with John to Boulogne, where he made his offering in the Church of the Virgin. He returned with King Edward to England at the beginning of November.\nMarriage to Joan.\nIn spring 1361 Edward married his second cousin once removed Joan, Countess of Kent, daughter of Edmund of Woodstock, Earl of Kent (younger son of Edward I, and Margaret, daughter of Philip III of France) and widow of Thomas Holland, 1st Earl of Kent, with whom she had five children. The wedding was performed in secret, without the knowledge of the Prince's parents. The marriage has been believed to be a love match both by contemporary chronicles and modern historians, as Prince of Wales acted without his father's approval and Joan was a widow in relatively advanced age, that did not make her ideal candidate for a future queen and mother of next royal heir; additionally Joan was an English noblewoman, which made her unusual choice of bride for the future king as there was no domestic queen in England since the time of conquest. \nBecause Edward and Joan were related in the third degree (and since Edward was the godfather of Joan's eldest son Thomas) a dispensation was needed to make their marriage valid; it was eventually obtained from Pope Innocent VI. While the wedding the couple had early that year was declared null, the Prince of Wales and his chosen bride were allowed to have a second ceremony, that was performed at Windsor on 10 October 1361 in the presence of King Edward III, by Simon Islip Archbishop of Canterbury. Edward and Joan resided at Berkhamsted Castle in Hertfordshire and held the manor of Princes Risborough; though local history describes the estate as \"his [Edward's] palace\", many sources suggest it was used more as a hunting lodge.\nPrince of Aquitaine and Gascony.\nOn 19 July 1362 Edward III granted Prince Edward all his dominions in Aquitaine and Gascony, to be held as a principality by liege homage on payment of an ounce of gold each year, together with the title of Prince of Aquitaine and Gascony. During the rest of the year he was occupied in preparing for his departure to his new principality, and after Christmas he received the king and his court at Berkhamsted, took leave of his father and mother, and in the following February sailed with Joan and all his household for Gascony, landing at La Rochelle.\nAt La Rochelle the prince was met by John Chandos, the king's lieutenant, and proceeded with him to Poitiers, where he received the homage of the lords of Poitou and Saintonge; he then rode to various cities and at last came to Bordeaux, where from 9 to 30 July he received the homage of the lords of Gascony. He received them graciously and kept an extravagant court, residing sometimes at Bordeaux and sometimes at Angoul\u00eame.\nThe prince appointed Chandos constable of Guyenne and provided the knights of his household with profitable offices. Their extravagance displeased the people. Many of the Gascon lords were dissatisfied at being handed over to the dominion of the English, at the favouritism the prince displayed towards his own countrymen, and at ostentatious magnificence they exhibited. Arnaud Amanieu, Lord of Albret, and many more were always ready to give what help they could to the French cause, and Gaston, Count of Foix, though he visited the prince on his first arrival, was thoroughly loyal to the French cause; in 1365 he refused to do homage for Bearn. Charles V, who succeeded to the throne of France in April 1364, encouraged the malcontents, and the prince's position was by no means easy.\nIn April 1363 Edward mediated between the Counts of Foix and Armagnac, who had for a long time been at war with each other. He also attempted in February 1364 to mediate between Charles of Blois and John of Montfort, rivals for the Duchy of Brittany. Both appeared before him at Poitiers, but his mediation was unsuccessful.\nIn May 1363 the prince entertained Peter, King of Cyprus, at Angoul\u00eame and held a tournament there. At the same time he and his lords excused themselves from assuming the cross\u2014that is, they declined to join Peter's proposed crusade. In the summer the lord of Albret was at Paris, and his forces and several other Gascon lords held the French cause in Normandy against the party of Navarre. Meanwhile, war was renewed in Brittany; the prince allowed Chandos to raise and lead a force to come to the aid of the party of Montfort, and Chandos won the Battle of Auray (29 September 1364) against the French.\nAt this time the French countryside was continually being harried by roving bands of unemployed mercenaries, known as \"free companies\" or \"routiers\", primarily composed of former English and Gascon soldiers. Because of their origins, these companies left Aquitaine untouched, and the prince was suspected, probably not without cause, of encouraging or at least of taking no pains to discourage their proceedings. Accordingly on 14 November 1364 Edward III called upon him to restrain their ravages.\nSpanish campaign (1365\u201367).\nIn 1365 the free companies under Sir Hugh Calveley and other leaders took service with Bertrand du Guesclin who employed them in 1366 in compelling King Peter of Castile to flee from his kingdom and in setting up his bastard brother, Henry of Trast\u00e1mara, as king in his stead. Peter, who was in alliance with Edward III, sent messengers to Prince Edward asking his help, and on receiving a gracious answer at Corunna set out for Bayonne with his son and his three daughters. The prince met him at Capbreton and rode with him to Bordeaux. Many of the prince's lords, both English and Gascon, did not want him to take up Peter's cause, but he (according to John Froissart) declared that it was not \"either decent or proper that a bastard should possess a kingdom as an inheritance, nor drive out of his realm his own brother, heir to the country by lawful marriage; and no king, or king's son, ought ever to suffer it, as being of the greatest prejudice to royalty.\"\nPeter won friends by declaring that he would make Edward's son king of Galicia and would divide his riches among those who helped him. A parliament was held at Bordeaux, in which it was decided to ask the wishes of the English king. Edward III replied that it was right that his son should help Peter, and the prince held another parliament at which the king's letter was read. Then the lords agreed to give their help, provided that their pay was secured to them. To give them the required security, the prince agreed to lend Peter whatever money was necessary.\nEdward and Peter then held a conference with Charles of Navarre at Bayonne and agreed with him to allow their troops to pass through his dominions. To persuade him to do this, Peter had, besides other grants, to pay Charles 56,000 florins, and this sum was lent to him by Edward. On 23 September a series of agreements (the Treaty of Libourne) were entered into between Edward, Peter, and Charles at Libourne, by which Peter covenanted to put the prince in possession of the province of Biscay and the territory and fortress of Castro de Urdial\u00e8s as pledges for the repayment of this debt, to pay 550,000 florins for six months' wages at specified dates, 250,000 florins being the prince's wages, and 800,000 florins the wages of the lords who were to serve in the expedition. Peter consented to leave his three daughters in Edward's hands as hostages for the fulfillment of these terms, and he further agreed that whenever the king, the prince, or their heirs should march in person against the Moors, they should have the command of the vanguard before all other Christian kings, and that if they were not present the banner of the king of England should be carried in the vanguard side by side with the banner of Castile.\nEdward received 100,000 francs from his father out of the ransom of John II, the late king of France, and used a part of this money to help to pay the soldiers he was taking into his pay. While his army was assembling he remained at Angoul\u00eame and was there visited by Peter. He then stayed over Christmas at Bordeaux, where Joan gave birth to their second son Richard. Prince Edward left Bordeaux early in February 1367 and joined his army at Dax where he remained three days and received a reinforcement of 400 men-at-arms and 400 archers sent out by Edward III under his brother John of Gaunt. From Dax, Edward advanced via Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port through Roncesvalles (in the Pyrenees) to Pamplona (the capital of Kingdom of Navarre).\nWhen Calveley and other English and Gascon leaders of free companies found that Prince Edward was about to fight for Peter, they withdrew from the service of Henry of Trast\u00e1mara and joined Edward \"because he was their natural lord\". While the prince was at Pamplona he received a letter of defiance from Henry. From Pamplona Edward marched by Arruiz to Salvatierra, which opened its gates to his army, and thence advanced to Vitoria, intending to march on Burgos by this direct route. A body of his knights, which he had sent out to reconnoitre under Sir William Felton, was defeated by a skirmishing party, and he found that Henry had occupied some strong positions, and especially Santo Domingo de la Calzada on the right of the river Ebro, and Zaldiaran mountain on the left, which made it impossible for him to reach Burgos through \u00c1lava. Accordingly he crossed the Ebro and encamped under the walls of Logro\u00f1o. During these movements the prince's army had suffered from want of provisions both for men and horses, and from wet and windy weather. At Logro\u00f1o, however, though provisions were still scarce, they were somewhat better off.\nOn 30 March 1367, the prince wrote an answer to Henry's letter. On 2 April he left Logro\u00f1o and moved to Navarrete, La Rioja. Meanwhile, Henry and his French allies had encamped at N\u00e1jera, so that the two armies were now near each other. Letters passed between Henry and Edward, for Henry seems to have been anxious to make terms. He declared that Peter was a tyrant and had shed much innocent blood, to which Edward replied that Peter had told him that all the persons he had slain were traitors. On the morning of 3 April, Edward's army marched from Navarrete, and all dismounted while they were yet some distance from Henry's army. The bulk of Edward's army was composed of mercenary free companies, and probably numbered between eight and ten thousand men.\nAs the Battle of N\u00e1jera began, the knights of Castile attacked and pressed the English vanguard, but the wings of Henry's army failed to move, so that the Gascon lords were able to attack the main body on the flanks. Then Edward brought the main body of his army into action, and the fighting became intense. At length Henry's vanguard gave way, and he fled from the field. When the battle was over Edward asked Peter to spare the lives of those who had offended him. Peter assented, with the exception of one notorious traitor, whom he at once put to death; and he also had two others slain the next day.\nAmong the prisoners was the French marshal Arnoul d'Audrehem, whom Edward had formerly taken prisoner at Poitiers and whom he had released on the condition that d'Audrehem give his word that he would not bear arms against the prince until his ransom was paid. When Edward saw him he reproached him bitterly and called him \"liar and traitor\". D'Audrehem denied that he was either, and Edward asked him whether he would submit to the judgment of a body of knights. To this d'Audrehem agreed, and Edward chose 12 knights\u2014four English, four Gascons, and four Bretons\u2014to judge between him and the marshal. After he had stated his case, d'Audrehem replied that he had not broken his word, for the army Edward led was not his own; he was merely in the pay of Peter. The knights considered that this view of Edward's position was sound and gave their verdict for d'Audrehem.\nOn 5 April 1367, Edward and Peter marched to Burgos, where they celebrated Easter. Edward, however, did not take up his quarters in the city but camped outside the walls at the Monastery of Las Huelgas. Peter did not pay him any of the money he owed him, and Edward could get nothing from him except a solemn renewal of his bond of the previous 23 September, which he made on 2 May 1367 before the high altar of the Cathedral of Burgos. By this time, Edward began to suspect his ally of treachery. Peter had no intention of paying his debts, and when Edward demanded possession of Biscay, Peter told him that the Biscayans would not consent to be handed over to him. To get rid of his creditor, Peter told Edward that he could not get money at Burgos and persuaded Edward to take up his quarters at Valladolid while he went to Seville, whence he declared he would send the money he owed.\nEdward remained at Valladolid during some very hot weather, waiting in vain for his money. His army suffered so terribly from dysentery and other diseases that it is said that scarcely one Englishman out of five ever saw England again. Edward was seized with a sickness from which he never thoroughly recovered and which some said was caused by poison. Food and drink were scarce, and the free companies in his pay harried the surrounding country.\nMeanwhile, Henry made war upon Aquitaine, took Bagn\u00e8res and wasted the country. Fearing that Charles of Navarre would not allow him to return through his dominions, Edward negotiated with King Peter IV of Aragon for a passage for his troops. Peter IV made a treaty with him, and when Charles of Navarre heard of it he agreed to allow Edward, the Duke of Lancaster, and some of their lords to pass through his country; so they returned through Roncesvalles and reached Bordeaux early in September 1367.\nWar in Aquitaine (1366\u201370).\nSome time after he had returned to Aquitaine, the free companies, some 6,000 strong, also reached Aquitaine, having passed through Kingdom of Aragon. As they had not received the whole of the money Edward had agreed to pay them, they took up their quarters in his country and began pillage the countryside. Edward persuaded the captains to leave Aquitaine, and the companies under their command crossed the Loire and did much damage to France. This greatly angered Charles V, who retaliated by encouraging disaffection among the Gascon lords.\nWhen Edward had been gathering his army for his Spanish expedition, the Lord of Albret had agreed to serve with 1,000 lances. Considering, however, that he had at least as many men as he could find provisions for, Edward on 8 December 1366 had written to him requesting that he would bring only 200 lances. The Lord of Albret was much incensed at this, and, though peace was made by his uncle the Count of Armagnac, did not forget the slight, and Froissart speaks of it as the \"first cause of hatred between him and the prince\". A more powerful cause of this lord's discontent was the non-payment of an annual pension which had been granted him by Edward. About this time he agreed to marry Margaret of Bourbon, sister of the queen of France. Edward was annoyed at this betrothal and, his temper probably being soured by sickness and disappointment, behaved with rudeness to both Albret and his intended bride. On the other hand, Charles offered the lord the pension which he had lost, and thus drew him and his uncle, the Count of Armagnac, altogether over to the French side.\nThe immense cost of the late campaign and his constant extravagance had brought Edward into financial difficulties, and as soon as he returned to Bordeaux he called an assembly of the estates of Aquitaine (Parliament) to meet at Saint-\u00c9milion to obtain a grant from them. It seems as though no business was done then, for in January 1368 he held a meeting of the estates at Angoul\u00eame and there persuaded them to allow him a hearth tax of ten sous for five years. An edict for this tax was published on 25 January 1368. The chancellor, Bishop John Harewell, held a conference at Niort, at which he persuaded the barons of Poitou, Saintonge, Limousin, and Rouergue to agree to this tax, but the great vassals of the high marches refused, and on 20 June and again on 25 October the Counts of Armagnac, P\u00e9rigord, and Comminges, and the lord of Albret laid their complaints before the king of France, declaring that he was their lord paramount. Meanwhile, Chandos, who strongly urged Edward against imposing this tax, had retired to his Norman estate. \nCharles took advantage of these appeals, and on 25 January 1369 sent messengers to Prince Edward, who was then residing at Bordeaux, summoning him to appear in person before him in Paris and there receive judgment. He replied: \"We will willingly attend at Paris on the day appointed since the king of France sends for us, but it shall be with our helmet on our head and sixty thousand men in our company\". Prince Edward caused the messengers to be imprisoned, and in revenge for this the Counts of P\u00e9rigord and Comminges and other lords set on Sir Thomas Wake, the high-steward of Rouergue, slew many of his men, and put him to flight. The prince sent for Chandos, who came to his help, and some fighting took place, though war was not yet declared. His health was now so feeble that he could not take part in active operations. By 18 March 1369 more than nine hundred towns, castles, and other places signified in one way or another their adherence to the French cause.\nPrince Edward had already warned his father of the intentions of the French king, but there was evidently a party at Edward III's court that was jealous of the prince's power (probably including the prince's younger brother, John of Gaunt), and his warnings were slighted. In April 1369, however, war was declared. Edward III sent the Earls of Cambridge and Pembroke to the prince's assistance, and Sir Robert Knolles again took service with him. The war in Aquitaine was desultory and, though the English maintained their ground fairly in the field, their hold on the country weakened every day the fighting dragged on.\nOn 1 January 1370, Prince Edward sustained a heavy loss in the death of Chandos. Several efforts were made by Edward to conciliate the Gascon lords, but they were fruitless and can only have served to weaken the prince's authority. It is probable that John of Gaunt was working against him at the English court, and when he was sent out in the summer to help his elder brother, he came with such extensive powers that he almost seemed as though he had come to supersede him.\nIn the spring, Charles raised two large armies for the invasion of Aquitaine; one, under Louis I, Duke of Anjou, was to enter Guyenne by La Reole and Bergerac, the other, under John, Duke of Berry, was to march towards Limousin and Quercy, and both were to unite and besiege the prince in Angoul\u00eame. Ill as he was, Edward left his bed of sickness and gathered an army at Cognac where he was joined by the Barons of Poitou and Saintonge, and the Earls of Cambridge, Lancaster, and Pembroke. The two French armies took many cities, united and laid siege to Limoges, which was treacherously surrendered to them by the bishop, Jean de Murat de Cros, who had been one of the prince's trusted friends.\nWhen Prince Edward heard of the surrender of Limoges to the French, he swore \"by the soul of his father\" that he would have the place again and would make the inhabitants pay dearly for their treachery. He set out from Cognac with an army of about 4,000 men. Due to his sickness he was unable to mount his horse, and was carried in a litter. During the siege of Limoges, the prince was determined to take the town and ordered the undermining of its walls. On 19 September, his miners succeeded in demolishing a large piece of wall which filled the ditches with its ruins. The town was then stormed, with the inevitable destruction and loss of life.\nThe Victorian historian William Hunt, author of Prince Edward's biography in the \"Dictionary of National Biography\" (1889), relying on Froissart as a source, wrote that when the bishop was brought before Edward, he told the bishop that his head should be cut off (though Lancaster persuaded him not to carry out the deed) and that the city was nevertheless pillaged and burnt, and 3,000 persons of all ranks and ages were massacred. However, modern scholarship, including the historian Richard Barber writing in 2008 in the \"Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\", and drawing on a wider range of evidence, places casualties much lower than Froissart does \u2013 around 300 garrison soldiers and civilians in total. Edward returned to Cognac; his sickness increased, and he was forced to give up all hope of being able to direct any further operations and to proceed first to Angoul\u00e8me and then to Bordeaux.\nReturn to England.\nThe death of Edward's eldest son Edward of Angoul\u00eame in 1371 caused him a great deal of grief. His health continued to deteriorate, and his personal doctor advised him to return to England. Edward left Aquitaine with the Duke of Lancaster and landed at Southampton early in January 1371. Edward met his father at Windsor. At this meeting, Prince Edward interceded to stop a treaty Edward III had concluded the previous month with Charles of Navarre because he objected to the ceding of lands to King Charles. After this, Edward returned to his manor in Berkhamsted.\nOn his return to England, Edward was publicly recognised as the natural opponent of the anti-clerical and Lancastrian party's influence. On 2 May he met the convocation of Canterbury at the Savoy and persuaded them to make an exceptionally large grant. His health began to improve, and in August 1372 he sailed with his father to the relief of Thouars; but contrary winds meant that the fleet never reached the French coast. On 6 October he resigned the principality of Aquitaine and Gascony, giving as his reason that its revenues were no longer sufficient to cover expenses. He acknowledged his resignation in Parliament the next month. At the conclusion of this parliament, after the knights had been dismissed, he met the citizens and burgesses \"in a room near the white chamber\" and prevailed on them to extend the customs granted the year before for the protection of merchant shipping for another year.\nEdward's illness returned in force, though when the \"Good Parliament\" met on 28 April 1376 he was the House of Commons' main ally in their criticism of the administration, and evidently acted in concert with William of Wykeham in opposing the influence of Lancaster, and he had good cause to fear that his brother's power would prove dangerous to the prospects of his son Richard. Richard Lyons, the king's financial agent who was impeached for gigantic frauds, sent him a bribe of \u00a31,000 and other gifts, but Edward refused to receive it, though he afterwards said that it was a pity he had not kept it and sent it to pay the soldiers who were fighting for the kingdom.\nDeath.\nFrom the period of the Good Parliament, Edward knew that he was dying. His fits of dysentery had become so violent they occasionally caused him to faint. He left gifts for his servants in his will and said goodbye to Edward III, whom he asked to confirm his gifts, pay his debts quickly out of his estate, and protect his son Richard. Edward's illness is thought to have started after his victory at the Battle of N\u00e1jera in 1367, relapsing sporadically over the next 9 years of his life. There are several diverse infections or inflammatory conditions that may have led to his demise. These might include malaria (specifically vivax), brucellosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or long-term complications of acute dysentery. However, chronic dysentery is probably unlikely.\nHis death was announced at the Palace of Westminster on 8 June 1376. In his last moments, he was attended by the Bishop of Bangor who urged him to ask forgiveness of God and of all those he had injured. He \"made a very noble end, remembering God his Creator in his heart\" and asked people to pray for him.\nEdward was buried in Canterbury Cathedral on 29September. His funeral and the design of his tomb were conducted in accordance to the directions dictated in his will. It has a bronze effigy beneath a tester depicting the Holy Trinity with his heraldic achievements\u00a0\u2013 his surcoat, helmet, shield and gauntlets\u00a0\u2013 hung over the tester; they have since been replaced with replicas; the originals now reside in a glass-fronted cabinet within the cathedral. His epitaph, inscribed around his effigy, is in French; one frequently quoted English translation reads (in part):\n&lt;poem&gt;Such as thou art, sometime was I.\nSuch as I am, such shalt thou be.\nI thought little on th'our of Death\nSo long as I enjoyed breath.\nOn earth I had great riches\nLand, houses, great treasure, horses, money and gold.\nBut now a wretched captive am I,\nDeep in the ground, lo here I lie.\nMy beauty great, is all quite gone,\nMy flesh is wasted to the bone.&lt;/poem&gt;\nArms and heraldic badge.\nArms: \"Quarterly, 1st and 4th azure sem\u00e9e of fleur-de-lys or\" (France Ancient); \"2nd and 3rd gules, three lions passant guardant or\" (England); \"overall a label of three points argent\". Crest: \"On a chapeau gules turned up ermine, a lion statant or gorged with a label of three points argent\". Mantling: \"gules lined ermine\". Edward's coat of arms as Prince of Wales were those of the kingdom, differenced by \"a label of three points argent\". Edward also used an alternative coat of \"Sable, three ostrich feathers argent\", described as his \"shield for peace\" (probably meaning the shield he used for jousting). This shield can be seen several times on his tomb chest, alternating with the differenced royal arms. John of Gaunt used a similar shield on which the ostrich feathers were ermine. Edward's \"shield for peace\" is believed to have inspired the badge of three ostrich feathers used by later Princes of Wales. The motto \"Ich dien\" means \"I serve\".\nFamily.\nEdward married his second cousin once removed Joan, Countess of Kent, in early 1361. Their wedding was conducted in secret, and was later annulled the same year because of lack of needed dispensation, but afterwards the couple managed to obtain the necessary documents and married once again on 10 October 1361. Joan was the daughter and heiress of Edmund, Earl of Kent, the younger son of King Edward I by his second wife Margaret of France. She and Edward had two sons, both born in Aquitaine:\nFrom his marriage to Joan he also became stepfather to her children by Thomas Holland:\nEdward had several natural sons before his marriage.\nWith Edith de Willesford (died after 1385):\nWith unknown mother:\nAppellation \"Black Prince\".\nEdward is often referred to as the \"Black Prince\". The first known source to use this sobriquet was the antiquary John Leland in the 1530s or early 1540s (about 165 years after Edward's death). Leland mentions it in two manuscript notes of this period, with the implication that it was in relatively widespread use by that date. In one instance, he refers in Latin to \"\"Edwardi Principis cog: Nigri\"\" (i.e., \"Edward the Prince, cognomen: The Black\"); in the other, in English to \"the Blake Prince\". In both instances, Leland is summarising earlier works \u2013 respectively, the 14th-century \"Eulogium Historiarum\" and the late 15th-century chronicle formerly attributed to John Warkworth \u2013 but in neither case does the name appear in his source texts. In print, Roger Ascham in his 1545 \"Toxophilus\" refers to \"ye noble black prince Edward beside Poeters\"; while Richard Grafton in his 1569 \"Chronicle at Large\" uses the name on three occasions, saying that \"some writers name him the black prince\", and elsewhere that he was \"commonly called the black Prince\". Raphael Holinshed uses it several times in his 1577 \"Chronicles\"; and it is also used by William Shakespeare in his plays \"Richard II\" (written c. 1595; Act 2, scene 3) and \"Henry V\" (c. 1599; Act 2, scene 4). In 1688, it appears in the title of Joshua Barnes's \"The History of that Most Victorious Monarch, Edward IIId, King of England and France, and Lord of Ireland, and First Founder of the Most Noble Order of the Garter: Being a Full and Exact Account Of the Life and Death of the said King: Together with That of his Most Renowned Son, Edward, Prince of Wales and of Aquitain, Sirnamed the Black-Prince\".\nThe origins of the name are uncertain, though many theories have been proposed, falling under two main themes, that it is derived from Edward's black shield (and/or the rumours that he wore black armour), or from his brutal reputation, particularly towards the French in Aquitaine. It was possibly intended as a \"double entendre\", combining these two meanings.\nThe black (\"sable\") field of his \"shield for peace\" is well documented. However, there is no sound evidence that Edward wore black armour, although John Harvey (without citing a source) refers to \"some rather shadowy evidence that he was described in French as clad at the battle of Cr\u00e9cy ' \"en armure noire en fer bruni\" ' \u2013 in black armour of burnished steel\". Richard Barber suggests that the name's origins may have lain in pageantry, in that a tradition may have grown up in the 15th century of representing the prince in black armour. He points out that several chronicles refer to him as Edward IV (the title he would have taken as king had he outlived his father): this name would obviously have become confusing when the actual Edward IV succeeded in 1461, and this may have been the period when an alternative had to be found.\nEdward's reputation for brutality in France is well documented, and it is possible that this is where the title had its origins. French soldier Philippe de M\u00e9zi\u00e8res refers to Edward as the greatest of the \"black boars\" \u2013 those aggressors who had done so much to disrupt relations within Christendom. Other French writers made similar associations, and Peter Hoskins reports that an oral tradition of \"L'Homme Noir\", who had passed by with an army, survived in southern France until recent years. In Shakespeare's \"Henry V\", the King of France alludes to \"that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales\". John Speed reported in 1611 that the Black Prince was so named \"not of his colour, but of his dreaded Acts in battell\"; a comment echoed in 1642 by Thomas Fuller, who wrote that he was named \"from his dreaded acts and not from his complexion\". Joshua Barnes claimed in 1688 that it was from the time of the Battle of Cr\u00e9cy that \"the \"French\" began to call [him] \"Le Neoir\", or the \"Black-Prince\"\", appearing to cite a record of 2 Richard II (i.e. 1378\u20131379); but his reference is insufficiently precise to be traceable. However, it is unclear how a French sobriquet might have crossed to England, and Barber finds this derivation of the name \"unlikely\".\nHistoriography and Legacy.\nEdward the Black Prince has been a common subject in scholarly work and interest of the period and beyond specifically in the Georgian and Victorian periods. One of the sources of the romanticized historical view of Edward came from a biography written in 1836. Another more modern source looks at Edwards role in promoting patriotism and chivalry.

Founded in 1853 by a group of civic leaders and named for George Washington, the university spans 355 acres across its Danforth and Medical campuses. It comprises nine schools and offers more than 150 undergraduate, 80 master's and professional, and 50 doctoral degree programs. As of 2024[ [update]], Washington University enrolled 16,399 students representing all 50 U.S. states and more than 110 countries.\nEstablished due to a concern of a lack of institutions of higher learning in the Midwest, the university held its first classes in 1854 in downtown St. Louis. In 1905, Washington University relocated to a new campus northwest of Forest Park, which allowed for expansion and new facilities to support its growing academic programs and student body. Construction of the first building, Busch Hall, began in 1900, followed by Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples. These buildings were not occupied until 1905 in order to accommodate the 1904 Summer Olympics and St. Louis World's Fair. By 1964, more than two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the St. Louis area. In 2021, the university adopted a need-blind undergraduate-admissions policy.\nWashington University joined the Association of American Universities in 1923. The university received over 32,750 applications for the Class of 2028 and admitted 12 percent. It supports more than 400 undergraduate student organizations. The university's athletic teams, the Washington University Bears, compete in NCAA Division III as founding members of the University Athletic Association and as a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin. Its mascot is the Bear, and its official colors are red and green. The Bears have won 26 NCAA Division III championships.\nGovernance of the university is overseen by a Board of Trustees, which ensures its alignment with educational, financial, and social objectives. As of 2024[ [update]], the university is led by Chancellor Andrew D. Martin and Provost Mark\u202fD. West. The university's endowment of $12.0 billion is among the fifteen largest in the United States. The university's motto is \"Per veritatem vis\", which translates to \"Strength through truth\". It is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Washington University has been the venue for four presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], 26 Nobel laureates, 11 Pulitzer Prize winners, 4 United States Poets Laureate, and 6 MacArthur Fellows have been affiliated with the university as faculty or alumni. A top producer of Fulbright scholars, Washington University alumni also include 17 university presidents, 21 members of the United States Congress, and 30 Rhodes Scholars.\nHistory.\n19th Century.\nFounding and early years.\nWashington University was founded in 1853 by 17 St. Louis business, religious, and political leaders concerned by the lack of institutions of higher learning in the Midwest. State Senator Wayman Crow and Unitarian minister William Greenleaf Eliot led the effort. Crow secured the university charter, and Eliot was named president of the board of trustees, with Crow serving as vice president. Joseph Gibson Hoyt became the university's inaugural chancellor.\nUnlike most American institutions, Washington University initially lacked a financial endowment and did not have the backing of a religious organization, wealthy patron, or government support.\nOriginally called Eliot Seminary, the name faced opposition from Eliot himself, who favored a nonsectarian identity for the institution. To address this, Eliot appointed a subcommittee consisting of himself and Samuel Treat to recommend a new name. The subcommittee proposed Washington Institute, in honor of George Washington, the nation's first president, as the charter had been granted on his birthday, February 22. The board unanimously approved the proposal. In 1856, the board officially amended the name to Washington University.\nGrowth and expansion.\nChartered as a university, it initially functioned primarily as a night school and did not have buildings, faculty, or established course offerings. Classes began on October 22, 1854, in the Benton Schoolhouse, a facility loaned by the public school board, which also covered utility costs and installed gas lighting for evening instruction. Tuition was offered free of charge. By the end of the first year, 270 students had enrolled, with ages ranging from 8 years old to 46 years old. The university hired four teachers from the public school system, two of whom later became the university's first full-time faculty members. In 1856, the university completed the first building on the three-acre site that it had purchased on Seventeenth Street and Washington Avenue. Washington University remained located in downtown St. Louis for its first fifty years. \nIn 1856, Eliot and other trustees established a preparatory academic department for boys. Admission was granted to boys aged ten and older who passed an exam in reading, writing, geography, and basic arithmetic. In 1859, a preparatory female department was established. In recognition of Eliot's leadership, the university insisted on naming it the Mary Institute, in honor of his daughter. In 1879, the academic department for boys was named Smith Academy.\nWashington University's law school (originally known as The St. Louis Law School) was the first undergraduate division of the university to admit women. In 1869, Lemma Barkeloo and Phoebe Couzins enrolled. Barkeloo passed the Missouri bar exam in her first year and did not complete the program, while Couzins earned her LL.B. in 1871. However, it wasn\u2019t until 1886 that women were regularly admitted again to the law school.\nIn 1871, Eliot was named the third chancellor of Washington University. In 1879, the St. Louis Manual Training School of Washington University became the first manual training school established in the United States. Students' time was divided equally between manual training and schoolwork.\nFacing declining enrollment in the 1870s, the university sought to strengthen ties with local preparatory schools, and, by 1880, graduates from select high schools could enter by certificate rather than examination. The college also introduced the Bachelor of Philosophy (Ph.B) degree as a more flexible alternative to the traditional Bachelor of Arts, with the Ph.B. placing greater emphasis on science, history, and English. Lectures and written exams replaced traditional oral recitations, and completing a senior thesis became a requirement for graduation for the Ph.B degree. Admitting women had a greater impact on enrollment than any academic reforms. After a unanimous faculty vote, the first woman enrolled in the undergraduate college in 1870; by the 1890s, women were the main drivers of the college's enrollment growth.\nDuring Eliot's chancellorship, student organizations at Washington University rose and fell quickly due to a lack of institutional support. Athletics were especially unstable, with clubs like baseball and rowing repeatedly forming and disbanding, though individual sports gained steadier traction with the building of gyms and hiring of instructors. A major shift occurred in 1890 when the Washington University Athletic Association (established in 1884) embraced intercollegiate football.\nIn 1890, the number of prescribed courses for the Bachelor of Arts degree was 40 of 45. By the end of 1892, Washington University had reduced the number of prescribed courses to 8 out of 38. This shift in policy also led to the abolition of alternative degrees like the Ph.B. and contributed to the creation of many new courses.\nWashington University's decision to purchase a tract of land for a new campus was driven by the rapid growth of St. Louis and the decreasing availability of suitable locations. The land was acquired for $, with financing arranged through a loan and the sale of University stock, backed by private guarantees. The university then enlisted Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot to design the campus, beginning with two landscape plans in 1895 and marking the beginning of the architects' broader influence. In 1897, the university formally announced plans in its catalog to move the Undergraduate Department to a new site northwest of Forest Park. Olmsted's praise of the site led the board to agree to buy the land without conditions. Olmsted also recommended acquiring additional land along Skinker Boulevard, which was completed in 1899 with help from Robert Brookings, and advised that future construction emphasize aesthetics. Their proposals included holding an architectural competition and grouping buildings in quadrangles, with the main building facing east from the ridge.\nMedical College affiliation.\nIn 1890, the St. Louis Medical College proposed establishing a physiological laboratory in partnership with Washington University. Although the university initially declined, the medical college renewed its efforts to affiliate. A joint committee formed in early 1891, and by April, the college formally became the \"Medical Department of Washington University\".\nIn 1892, the Missouri Dental College, with a curriculum closely aligned with the St. Louis Medical College, also affiliated with Washington University.\nIn 1899, the Missouri Medical College, established in 1840 as the oldest medical school west of the Mississippi in conjunction with Kemper College, merged with the St. Louis Medical College. Historian Historian Ralph E. Morrow later wrote that this affiliation completed the foundation of Washington University's health programs. The merger doubled medical school enrollment. It also provided greater access to hospital beds for clinical work and expanded physical facilities, including the conversion of a Missouri Medical College building into Washington University's first hospital.\nUniversity seal.\nIn 1896, Holmes Smith, professor of Drawing and History of Art, designed what became the basis for the university seal. The seal is made up of elements from the Washington family coat of arms, an open book representing a university, and the symbol of Louis IX, after whom the city is named. In 1915, the university adopted its motto, \"Per veritatem vis\", which translates to \"Strength through truth\".\n20th century.\nCampus building and academic foundation.\nThe cornerstone of the first building on its new Hilltop Campus, Busch Hall was laid on October 20, 1900. Construction of additional buildings, including Brookings Hall, Ridgley, and Cupples began shortly thereafter. Washington University postponed occupying these buildings until 1905 to accommodate the 1904 World's Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics. Robert S. Brookings, president of the board, leased the first five University buildings to the Fair. The $ generated from the lease was then used to fund the construction of four additional buildings, which were also used by the Fair.\nBy 1905, the number of course offerings in the college had tripled.\nIn 1909, the college implemented curricular changes that included a distribution requirement and a limit on how much concentration was allowed in a single field of study.\nThe School of Medicine formalized partnerships with Barnes Hospital in 1911 and St. Louis Children's Hospital in 1912. These agreements required hospital staffs to consist entirely of University faculty, while granting the university access to patients for clinical instruction and research. In return, Washington University pledged to construct and maintain modern medical facilities and laboratories adjacent to the hospitals. In 1915, the university completed a new medical complex on Kingshighway Boulevard. Three years later, Aphrodite Jannopoulo, Carol Skinner Cole, and Faye Cashatt became the first women to enroll as medical students.\nIn 1922, Arthur Holly Compton, head of the Department of Physics, conducted a series of experiments in the basement of Eads Hall that demonstrated the particle concept of electromagnetic radiation. Compton's discovery, known as the \"Compton Effect,\" earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927.\nIn 1923, Washington University became a member of the Association of American Universities.\nDesegregation and Social Change.\nIn 1945, four African-American students were denied admission to the university's summer school, prompting the NAACP and the city of St. Louis to file a lawsuit challenging the institution's tax-exempt status. The suit argued that the university's segregationist policies violated its obligations as a tax-exempt entity. Although the legal action did not succeed, it led the university's board of directors to publicly address the issue of segregation for the first time.\nCompton, after 22 years at the University of Chicago, returned to Washington University in 1946 to become its ninth chancellor. He reestablished the Washington University football team and emphasized a \"strictly amateur\" athletic policy with no athletic scholarships. Under Compton, the university saw enrollment growth, driven by World War II veterans using the G.I. Bill, which covered college costs for military personnel. In spring 1946, enrollment increased by 39 percent to 9,159 students; by fall 1947, enrollment had reached 13,204 students.\nBefore the board fully responded, the initiative for desegregation was taken up by individual deans and departments. In June 1947, the medical school sought retroactive approval for admitting an African-American student to a postgraduate course in ophthalmology, which the board granted. That same year, President Harry S. Truman's Commission on Higher Education recommended repealing segregation laws in higher education. Although the first African-American student did not begin undergraduate medical studies until 1951, by then, the medical school had already appointed African Americans to its part-time clinical faculty and named Ernest S. Sims as the first African American to hold a full-time academic appointment in the university.\nSimilarly, the School of Social Work began admitting African-American students in December 1947. The graduate school followed suit a few months later. In 1949, a group of students formed the Student Committee for the Admission of Negroes (SCAN). In May 1949, SCAN conducted a poll in which nearly one-third of the student body participated, with 77 percent expressing support for ending segregation. By the winter of 1949, racial tests for admission were abolished in all postbaccalaureate programs on the Hilltop Campus. The dentistry school followed in early 1950. On May 9, 1952, racial tests for admissions to undergraduate programs were abolished.\nOn March 5, 1958, the Board of Directors approved HOK's plans for four residence halls and a food service building. Work on the South 40, named for its location south of the Hilltop Campus and its size of , site commenced before July 4, 1958. The project was completed in four phases. Each wave of construction expanded residential capacity: The first group of dormitories accommodated nearly 600 students, the second added another 600, and subsequent phases continued to increase housing availability on campus. With additional on-campus housing, the university, which had been predominantly attended by commuter students, began attracting a greater number of applicants from across the nation. By 1964, over two-thirds of incoming students came from outside the St. Louis area.\nActivism and identity.\nIn the late 1960s, Black students established the Association of Black Collegians (ABC). The group (later the Association of Black Students) supported Black students, addressed issues related to campus policing, and advocated for more inclusive representation in the academic curriculum. On December 5, 1968, Elbert Walton, an MBA student, had an incident with campus police. Around 10:30 a.m., officers stopped him, and he reportedly refused to show his ID. The police then took him to the ground, handcuffed him, and placed him in a police car. Walton was later taken to the police station, where he sat in a chair while still handcuffed. When ABC learned about Walton's arrest, the group organized a sit-in at the police office, later expanding their occupation to the basement of Brookings Hall. After arrests and negotiations, the university expanded diversity efforts, including the establishment of the department of African and African-American Studies.\nIn May 1970, Washington University experienced student unrest in response to the U.S. invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State shooting. On the evening of May 4, a large meeting in Brookings Quadrangle led to a march of 1,200 to 1,500 students toward the AFROTC building. The building was subsequently damaged by a rock-throwing crowd and set on fire in the early hours of May 5. County firemen extinguished the fire after initial attempts by the Clayton Fire Department were hindered by protestors.\nIn 1971, the board of trustees appointed Chancellor William Henry Danforth. According to The New York Times, under Chancellor Danforth, Washington University transformed from a commuter school into a world-renowned institution. During his 24-year chancellorship, he established 70 new endowed professorships, constructed dozens of buildings, secured a $1.72 billion endowment, and tripled the number of student scholarships.\nTo better distinguish itself in national media, the university's board of trustees added the phrase \"in St. Louis\" in 1976.\nInstitutional development and expansion.\nIn 1995, Mark S. Wrighton, the former provost at MIT, was elected the university's 14th chancellor. During Chancellor Wrighton's tenure, undergraduate applications to Washington University more than doubled, and the university has added more than 190 endowed professorships, revamped its Arts &amp; Sciences curriculum, and completed more than 30 new buildings. The university has also built more than 50 new buildings and increased its endowment by more than $5 billion.\n21st century.\nIn 2005, Washington University established the \"McDonnell International Scholars Academy\", an international network of research universities build a global network to address challenges like disease and poverty, through academic collaboration, with an initial endowment gift of $10,000,000 () from John F. McDonnell. Initially, it began with 15 partner institutions in Asia. As of 2022[ [update]], it has more than 30 partner institutions around the world.\nThe Hilltop Campus was renamed the Danforth Campus in 2006 to honor former chancellor William H. Danforth.\nIn 2014, a study ranked Washington University first in the country for income inequality with approximately 22 percent of its students coming from the top one percent of earners, and about 6 percent from the bottom sixty percent of earners. In response to criticism, the university committed to increase the percentage of Pell-eligible students on campus from 6 percent to 13 percent by 2020. The university achieved that goal three years early, and as of 2022[ [update]], 19.9 percent of undergraduate students were eligible for Pell Grants, representing a 300 percent increase since 2012.\nIn June 2019, Andrew D. Martin, the former dean of the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts at the University of Michigan, was elected the university's 15th chancellor. At his inauguration, Martin announced the \"WashU Pledge\", a program that offers free tuition to full-time students from Missouri and southern Illinois whose families either earn $75,000 or less per year or qualify for Pell Grants (federal money that helps low-income students pay for college and doesn\u2019t need to be repaid). In 2021, the university launched a $1 billion plan called Gateway to Success. $800 million for need-blind admission (meaning students are accepted without looking at their financial needs) and to cover all their financial need. Another $200 million was set aside to help graduate and professional students pay for school. Under Martin's leadership, the School of Continuing &amp; Professional Studies was redesigned to make college more accessible for more people. He also expanded the WashU Pledge and started the Heartland Initiative to help talented students from the region succeed and stay after graduation.\nIn 2024, Washington University purchased the 16-acre campus of neighboring Fontbonne University, which is set to close in 2025, for $39 million.\nU.S. presidential and vice-presidential debates.\nAs of 2024[ [update]], Washington University has been the venue for four presidential debates and one vice-presidential debate: the inaugural 1992 presidential debate on October 11, 1992, the third 2000 Presidential debate on October 17, the second 2004 Presidential debate on October 8, the sole between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin on October 2, and the second 2016 Presidential debate on October 9. A 1996 debate was scheduled but canceled when the number of debates was reduced to two.\nOrganization and administration.\nFrom its inception, Washington University has been governed by an independent board of trustees which, by charter, appoints its own members. Trustees serve four-year terms and may be eligible for re-election upon the completion of a term. The Board is responsible for the university's fiduciary oversight, strategic governance, and major institutional decisions, including setting policy and providing overall guidance. These include appointing the chancellor, reviewing and approving the annual budget, authorizing major capital expenditures, making final decisions on tenure and degree conferrals, and approving the creation of new academic programs.\nFrom 1983 to 1987, the \"Alliance for Washington University\" campaign raised more than $. From 1998 to 2004, the \"Campaign for Washington University\" raised more than $.\nOn June 1, 2019, Andrew D. Martin was appointed the 15th chancellor of Washington University after Chancellor Mark S Wrighton announced his plans to retire. The chancellor is responsible for overseeing the university's day-to-day operations, including managing staff, implementing the board's policies and decisions, ensuring compliance, and leading strategic initiatives. The chancellor also provides vision and leadership across academics, research, fundraising, and administration.\nIn 2020, Mark D. West, former dean of University of Michigan Law School, was appointed Provost.\nWashington University is a member of the Association of American Universities, American Association of Colleges and Universities, Universities Research Association, American Council of Learned Societies Research University Consortium, and is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission.\nFinances, costs, and financial aid.\nAs of June 30, 2024, Washington University has an endowment of $12.0 billion, ranking it among the top 15 university endowments in the United States. Its total assets (including its campus) are valued at $20.48 billion. In Fiscal Year 2024, it had an operating budget of $5.23 billion of which 11 percent came from endowment spending. Of its $5.23 billion operating budget, it had expenses of $5.08 billion. Of the $5.08 billion, $3.026 billion went to instruction, $892.7 million to research, $489.8 million to academic support, $296.4 to institutional support, $165.1 million to auxiliary enterprises, $161.3 million to student services, and $51.6 million to other deductions.\nFor the 2025\u2013\u200d2026 academic year, Washington University charged a tuition fee of $68,240 per student, with a total estimated on-campus cost of attendance of $92,932. Washington University practices need-blind admissions and meets 100 percent of admitted students' demonstrated needs. Of the 1,823 first-year students enrolled in 2023\u20132024[ [update]], 929 applied for need-based financial aid, and 796 were determined to have financial need. Among those 796 students, 100 percent of demonstrated need was met on average (excluding any aid awarded beyond calculated need). It does not offer any athletic scholarships.\nCampuses.\nDanforth.\nIn 1899, the university held a national design competition for a new campus. The Philadelphia firm Cope &amp; Stewardson, known for their work at the University of Pennsylvania, Bryn Mawr College, and Princeton University, won with a design based on Collegiate Gothic quadrangles inspired by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.\nThe university's 169-acre Danforth Campus is bordered by the Forest Park section of St. Louis and Clayton and University City, Missouri. A large portion of the Danforth Campus is recognized as the Washington University Hilltop Campus Historic District, which is a National Historic Landmark.\nMedical.\nWashington University Medical Center comprises spread over 18 city blocks, located along the eastern edge of Forest Park within the Central West End neighborhood of St. Louis. The campus is home to the Washington University School of Medicine and its partners, Barnes-Jewish Hospital and St. Louis Children's Hospital.\nIn 2019, Washington University was awarded a $7.6 million grant from the National Cancer Institute to establish the Implementation Science Center for Cancer Control to address disparities in cancer care in parts of Missouri and Illinois. In 2022, Washington University's Institute of Clinical and Translational Sciences was awarded a five-year $61 million grant from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health, to advance precision medicine, health equity, and diversity initiatives.\nAcademics.\nIn 2023, Washington University was one of 10 universities picked to join the Kessler Scholars Collaborative, which provides support for selected first-generation and Pell-Grant eligible STEM students. The program aims to recruit 20 fully funded Kessler scholars per year and provide additional opportunities to close the wealth gap.\nAdmissions.\nFor the class of 2028 (entering fall 2024), Washington University in St. Louis received over 32,750 applications and admitted 12 percent of applicants. Of those admitted, 86 percent who reported their rank were in the top 10 percent of their high-school class. Additionally, 25 percent of enrolled students were Pell Grant-eligible, and 18 percent were first-generation college students.\nThe middle 50 percent of admitted students who submitted standardized test scores scored between 33 and 35 on the ACT (out of a maximum score of 36), and between 1500 and 1570 on the SAT (out of a maximum score of 1600). National averages for these tests are approximately 19.4 for the ACT and 1050 for the SAT. For comparison, admitted students scored in the 98th to 99th national percentile, indicating that these students outperformed 98 to 99 percent of recent test takers.\nThe student-faculty ratio is 7:1.\nLibraries.\nThe Washington University library system comprises nine libraries, with Olin Library serving as the main library. According to the American Library Association, it is the 44th largest library in the United States by volume count, holding over 5.3 million volumes. It is a member of the Association of Research Libraries. The remaining eight libraries in the system include Al and Ruth Kopolow (Business) Library, Bernard Becker Medical Library, Brown School Library, East Asian Library, Gaylord Music Library, Kenneth and Nancy Kranzberg Art &amp; Architecture Library, Law Library and West Campus Library.\nThe Department of Special Collections at Washington University Libraries encompasses four units: Rare Books, Manuscripts, University Archives, and the Film &amp; Media Archive.

Donated to the university in 2015, it is now part of the university's Special Collections.\nRankings and reputation.\nWashington University is ranked 20th in the nation in the 2026 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" National Universities ranking and 26th by \"The Wall Street Journal\" in their rankings. In 2025, the university was ranked 26th in the world by the \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\".\nIn its 2025 edition, Princeton Review ranked Washington University as number 1 for \"Top Midwest Entrepreneurship: Ugrad\" and as number 2 for \"Top Entrepreneurship Under Ten Thousand Students: Ugrad\".\nIn 2025, Washington University in St. Louis was included in Forbes' \"2025 New Ivies: 20 Great Colleges Employers Love\", which highlights universities known for their academic rigor and producing graduates who are highly sought after by employers, with many graduates considered by employers to be outpacing their Ivy League peers.\nIn the 2016 edition of \"The Hidden Ivies: 63 of America's Top Liberal Arts Colleges and Universities\", a guidebook by educational consultants Howard and Matthew Greene, included Washington University in St. Louis among the institutions they described as offering an Ivy League-level education in terms of academic rigor, intellectual atmosphere, and campus experience.\nWashington University is among the top institutions producing recipients of various competitive postgraduate fellowships, including the Fulbright program, Harry S. Truman Scholarship, and Rhodes Scholarship.\nResearch.\nWashington University is classified as an R1 university, denoting \"Very High Research Spending and Doctorate Production\" on the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The Carnegie Classification helps categorize colleges and universities based on data like research activity and degrees awarded.\nAccording to the National Science Foundation's Higher Education Research and Development Survey for fiscal year As of fiscal year 2023[ [update]], Washington University ranks 27th among U.S. institutions in total research and development (R&amp;D) expenditures. In that year, Washington University reported $1.169 billion in R&amp;D spending, reflecting an 11.7 percent increase from the previous year. In 2022, Washington University developed a nasal vaccine aimed at addressing COVID-19; it was licensed for use in India to Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech and the technology was licensed to bio-tech company Ocugen. Bharat named their licensed version of the vaccine iNCOVACC. In 2025, Washington University's vaccine was approved for clinical trials in the United States.\nIn 2019, Washington University School of Medicine took over Folding@Home, a distributed computing project, from Stanford University. The project, which taps into the idle power of personal computers owned by volunteers to simulate protein folding, reached a speed of 1.5 exaFLOPS in 2020\u2014seven times faster than the world's top supercomputer, Summit, and more powerful than the top 100 supercomputers in the world, combined. This speed fuels research into diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, COVID-19, and Ebola.\nWashington University hosts NASA's Planetary Data System Geosciences Node, supporting unmanned Mars missions, with Professor Raymond Arvidson serving as deputy principal investigator for the Mars Exploration Rovers and co-investigator for the Phoenix lander's robotic arm.\nBeyond STEM, Washington University students have digitized the works of 16th-century poet Edmund Spenser. Led by English professor Joseph Loewenstein and supported by a $150,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the project marks the first major update to Spenser's collected works since Oxford University Press's edition nearly a century ago. The new edition, produced in collaboration with scholars at four other universities, will include both a comprehensive print publication and a digital archive.\nColleges and schools.\nAcross its schools, it offers more than 150 undergraduate, 80 master's and professional, and 50 doctoral degree programs.\nCampus life.\nStudent body.\nIn 2024, Washington University enrolled 16,399 students who came from all 50 U.S. states and more than 110 countries. This includes 8,243 undergraduate students and 7,289 graduate students.\nOf the 1,848 first year students enrolled in fall 2024, 37 percent were white/Caucasian, 26 percent were Asian, 12 percent were Latino/Hispanic, 8 percent were black/African-American, 11 percent were international, and 5 percent did not identify; 53 percent were female and 47 percent were male.\nStudent organizations.\nWashington University has over 400 undergraduate student organizations on campus.

KWUR (90.3 FM) serves as the students' official radio station. In 2003, KWUR won the critic's choice from the \"Riverfront Times\" for the Best Radio Station in St. Louis. WUTV is the university's closed-circuit television channel. It was founded in 1976.\nTransportation.\nSince 2006, the university began offering free MetroLink (St. Louis's light rail commuter train system) passes to all full-time students, benefits-eligible faculty and staff, and full-time employees of qualified service providers. The Blue Line and the Red Line are on the Danforth Campus along Forest Park Parkway. The Red Line provides access to the St. Louis Lambert International Airport, University of Missouri\u2013St. Louis and the Delmar Loop. The Blue Line provides access to the suburbs of Clayton, Brentwood, and Richmond Heights. Both provide access to the Gateway Arch (U.S. National Historic Landmark in downtown St. Louis) and access to the village of Fairview, Illinois.\nThe Washington University shuttle system includes a Campus Circulator (which provides free transportation around Danforth Campus for faculty, staff, students and guests) and seven neighborhood routes that go to locations outside of Danforth Campus. In 2025, the Shopper Shuttle was introduced as a pilot program. The Shopper Shuttle provides transportation to Saint Louis Galleria (a shopping mall), Target, and Walmart.\nTraditions.\nEvery semester, Washington University hosts WILD, a concert in the Quad that features popular musical acts. Other traditions include Thurtene Carnival (a student-run carnival), Vertigo (a dance party put on by the Engineering School Council), and Residential Community Olympics (an annual competition between residential colleges featuring different sports and activities). Students also use the Underpass panels, a series of displays along the walls of the underpass connecting the South 40 to the main Danforth Campus, to advertise events.\nA superstition among students warns that stepping on the university seal at Brookings Hall will prevent one from graduating on time.\nAthletics.\nWashington University was a founding member of the University Athletic Association of NCAA Division III and previously was a founding member of the Missouri Valley Conference. It is also a member of the College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin.\nThe Bears have won 26 NCAA Division III championships\u2014ten in volleyball (1989, 1991\u20131996, 2003, 2007, 2009), five in women's basketball (1998\u20132001, 2010), two in men's basketball (2008, 2009), two in women's cross country (2011, 2018), two in women's outdoor track and field (2017, 2024), two in women's soccer (2016, 2024), one in men's tennis (2008), one in women's indoor track and field (2017), and one in men's indoor track and field (2022) \u2013 and 267 conference titles.

{"id": "58921", "revid": "28979433", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58921", "title": "Natural disaster", "text": "Type of adverse event\nA natural disaster is the very harmful impact on a society or community brought by natural phenomenon or hazard. Some examples of natural hazards include avalanches, droughts, earthquakes, floods, heat waves, landslides - including submarine landslides, tropical cyclones, volcanic activity and wildfires. Additional natural hazards include blizzards, dust storms, firestorms, hails, ice storms, sinkholes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and tsunamis. \nA natural disaster can cause loss of life or damage property. It typically causes economic damage. How bad the damage is depends on how well people are prepared for disasters and how strong the buildings, roads, and other structures are. \nScholars have argued the term \"natural disaster\" is unsuitable and should be abandoned. Instead, the simpler term \"disaster\" could be used. At the same time, the type of hazard would be specified. A disaster happens when a natural or human-made hazard impacts a vulnerable community. It results from the combination of the hazard and the exposure of a vulnerable society.\nNowadays it is hard to distinguish between \"natural\" and \"human-made\" disasters. The term \"natural disaster\" was already challenged in 1976. Human choices in architecture, fire risk, and resource management can cause or worsen natural disasters. Climate change also affects how often disasters due to extreme weather hazards happen. These \"climate hazards\" are floods, heat waves, wildfires, tropical cyclones, and the like.\nSome things can make natural disasters worse. Examples are inadequate building norms, marginalization of people and poor choices on land use planning. Many developing countries do not have proper disaster risk reduction systems. This makes them more vulnerable to natural disasters than high income countries. An adverse event only becomes a disaster if it occurs in an area with a vulnerable population. &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTerminology.\nA \"natural disaster\" is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. The term \"disaster\" itself is defined as follows: \"Disasters are serious disruptions to the functioning of a community that exceed its capacity to cope using its own resources. Disasters can be caused by natural, man-made and technological hazards, as well as various factors that influence the exposure and vulnerability of a community.\"\nThe US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) explains the relationship between natural disasters and natural hazards as follows: \"Natural hazards and natural disasters are related but are not the same. A natural hazard is the threat of an event that will likely have a negative impact. A natural disaster is the negative impact following an actual occurrence of natural hazard in the event that it significantly harms a community. An example of the distinction between a natural hazard and a disaster is that an earthquake is the hazard which caused the 1906 San Francisco earthquake disaster.\nA \"natural hazard\" is a natural phenomenon that might have a negative effect on humans and other animals, or the environment. Natural hazard events can be classified into two broad categories: geophysical and biological. Natural hazards can be provoked or affected by anthropogenic processes, e.g. land-use change, drainage and construction.\nThere are 18 natural hazards included in the National Risk Index of FEMA: avalanche, coastal flooding, cold wave, drought, earthquake, hail, heat wave, tropical cyclone, ice storm, landslide, lightning, riverine flooding, strong wind, tornado, tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire, winter weather. In addition, there are also dust storms.\nCritique.\nThe term \"natural disaster\" has been called a misnomer already in 1976. A disaster is a result of a natural hazard impacting a vulnerable community. But disasters can be avoided. Earthquakes, droughts, floods, storms, and other events lead to disasters because of human action and inaction. Poor land and policy planning and deregulation can create worse conditions. They often involve development activities that ignore or fail to reduce the disaster risks. Nature alone is blamed for disasters even when disasters result from failures in development. Disasters also result from failure of societies to prepare. Examples for such failures include inadequate building norms, marginalization of people, inequities, overexploitation of resources, extreme urban sprawl and climate change.\nDefining disasters as solely natural events has serious implications when it comes to understanding the causes of a disaster and the distribution of political and financial responsibility in disaster risk reduction, disaster management, compensation, insurance and disaster prevention. Using \"natural\" to describe disasters misleads people to think the devastating results are inevitable, out of our control, and are simply part of a natural process. Hazards (earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, drought etc.) are inevitable, but the impact they have on society is not.\nThus, the term \"natural disaster\" is unsuitable and should be abandoned in favor of the simpler term \"disaster\", while also specifying the category (or type) of hazard.\nScale.\nBy region and country.\nAs of 2019, the countries with the highest share of disability-adjusted life years (DALY) lost due to natural disasters are Bahamas, Haiti, Zimbabwe and Armenia (probably mainly due to the Spitak Earthquake). The Asia-Pacific region is the world's most disaster prone region. A person in Asia-Pacific is five times more likely to be hit by a natural disaster than someone living in other regions.\nBetween 1995 and 2015, the greatest number of natural disasters occurred in America, China and India. In 2012, there were 905 natural disasters worldwide, 93% of which were weather-related disasters. Overall costs were US$170\u00a0billion and insured losses $70\u00a0billion. 2012 was a moderate year. 45% were meteorological (storms), 36% were hydrological (floods), 12% were climatological (heat waves, cold waves, droughts, wildfires) and 7% were geophysical events (earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). Between 1980 and 2011 geophysical events accounted for 14% of all natural catastrophes.\nDeveloping countries often have ineffective communication systems as well as insufficient support for disaster risk reduction and emergency management. This makes them more vulnerable to natural disasters than high income countries.\nSlow and rapid onset events.\nNatural hazards occur across different time scales as well as area scales. Tornadoes and flash floods are rapid onset events, meaning they occur with a short warning time and are short-lived. Slow onset events can also be very damaging, for example drought is a natural hazards that develops slowly, sometimes over years.\nImpacts.\nA natural disaster may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage.\nOn death rates.\nGlobally, the total number of deaths from natural disasters has been reduced by 75% over the last 100 years, due to the increased development of countries, increased preparedness, better education, better methods, and aid from international organizations. Since the global population has grown over the same time period, the decrease in number of deaths per capita is larger, dropping to 6% of the original amount.\nThe death rate from natural disasters is highest in developing countries due to the lower quality of building construction, infrastructure, and medical facilities.\nOn the economy.\nGlobal economic losses due to extreme weather, climate and water events are increasing. Costs have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s. Direct losses from disasters have averaged above US$330 billion annually between 2015 and 2021. Socio-economic factors have contributed to this trend of increasing losses, such as population growth and increased wealth. This shows that increased exposure is the most important driver of economic losses. However, part of these are also due to human-induced climate change.\nOn the environment.\nDuring emergencies such as natural disasters and armed conflicts more waste may be produced, while waste management is given low priority compared with other services. Existing waste management services and infrastructures can be disrupted, leaving communities with unmanaged waste and increased littering. Under these circumstances human health and the environment are often negatively impacted.\nNatural disasters (e.g. earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes) have the potential to generate a significant amount of waste within a short period. Waste management systems can be out of action or curtailed, often requiring considerable time and funding to restore. For example, the tsunami in Japan in 2011 produced huge amounts of debris: estimates of 5 million tonnes of waste were reported by the Japanese Ministry of the Environment. Some of this waste, mostly plastic and styrofoam washed up on the coasts of Canada and the United States in late 2011. Along the west coast of the United States, this increased the amount of litter by a factor of 10 and may have transported alien species. Storms are also important generators of plastic litter. A study by Lo et al. (2020) reported a 100% increase in the amount of microplastics on beaches surveyed following a typhoon in Hong Kong in 2018.\nA significant amount of plastic waste can be produced during disaster relief operations. Following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the generation of waste from relief operations was referred to as a \"second disaster\". The United States military reported that millions of water bottles and styrofoam food packages were distributed although there was no operational waste management system. Over 700,000 plastic tarpaulins and 100,000 tents were required for emergency shelters. The increase in plastic waste, combined with poor disposal practices, resulted in open drainage channels being blocked, increasing the risk of disease.\nConflicts can result in large-scale displacement of communities. People living under these conditions are often provided with minimal waste management facilities. Burn pits are widely used to dispose of mixed wastes, including plastics. Air pollution can lead to respiratory and other illnesses. For example, Sahrawi refugees have been living in five camps near Tindouf, Algeria for nearly 45 years. As waste collection services are underfunded and there is no recycling facility, plastics have flooded the camps' streets and surroundings. In contrast, the Azraq camp in Jordan for refugees from Syria has waste management services; of 20.7 tonnes of waste produced per day, 15% is recyclable.\nOn women and vulnerable populations.\nBecause of the social, political and cultural context of many places throughout the world, women are often disproportionately affected by disaster. In the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, more women died than men, partly due to the fact that fewer women knew how to swim. During and after a natural disaster, women are at increased risk of being affected by gender based violence and are increasingly vulnerable to sexual violence. Disrupted police enforcement, lax regulations, and displacement all contribute to increased risk of gender based violence and sexual assault.\nIn addition to LGBT people and immigrants, women are also disproportionately victimized by religion-based scapegoating for natural disasters: fanatical religious leaders or adherents may claim that a god or gods are angry with women's independent, freethinking behavior, such as dressing 'immodestly', having sex or abortions. For example, Hindutva party Hindu Makkal Katchi and others blamed women's struggle for the right to enter the Sabarimala temple for the August 2018 Kerala floods, purportedly inflicted by the angry god Ayyappan.\nDuring and after natural disasters, routine health behaviors become interrupted. In addition, health care systems may have broken down as a result of the disaster, further reducing access to contraceptives. Unprotected intercourse during this time can lead to increased rates of childbirth, unintended pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nPregnant women are one of the groups disproportionately affected by natural disasters. Inadequate nutrition, little access to clean water, lack of health-care services and psychological stress in the aftermath of the disaster can lead to a significant increase in maternal morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, shortage of healthcare resources during this time can convert even routine obstetric complications into emergencies.\nOnce a vulnerable population has experienced a disaster, the community can take many years to repair and that repair period can lead to further vulnerability. The disastrous consequences of natural disaster also affect the mental health of affected communities, often leading to post-traumatic symptoms. These increased emotional experiences can be supported through collective processing, leading to resilience and increased community engagement.\nOn governments and voting processes.\nDisasters stress government capacity, as the government tries to conduct routine as well as emergency operations. Some theorists of voting behavior propose that citizens update information about government effectiveness based on their response to disasters, which affects their vote choice in the next election. Indeed, some evidence, based on data from the United States, reveals that incumbent parties can lose votes if citizens perceives them as responsible for a poor disaster response or gain votes based on perceptions of well-executed relief work. The latter study also finds, however, that voters do not reward incumbent parties for disaster preparedness, which may end up affecting government incentives to invest in such preparedness.\nDisasters caused by geological hazards.\nEarthquakes.\nAn earthquake is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust that creates seismic waves. At the Earth's surface, earthquakes manifest themselves by vibration, shaking, and sometimes displacement of the ground. Earthquakes are caused by slippage within geological faults. The underground point of origin of the earthquake is called the seismic focus. The point directly above the focus on the surface is called the epicenter. Earthquakes by themselves rarely kill people or wildlife \u2013 it is usually the secondary events that they trigger, such as building collapse, fires, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, that cause death. Many of these can possibly be avoided by better construction, safety systems, early warning and planning.\nSinkholes.\nA sinkhole is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer. When natural erosion, human mining or underground excavation makes the ground too weak to support the structures built on it, the ground can collapse and produce a sinkhole.\nCoastal erosion.\nCoastal erosion is a physical process by which shorelines in coastal areas around the world shift and change, primarily in response to waves and currents that can be influenced by tides and storm surge. Coastal erosion can result from long-term processes (see also beach evolution) as well as from episodic events such as tropical cyclones or other severe storm events. Coastal erosion is one of the most significant coastal hazards. It forms a threat to infrastructure, capital assets and property.\nVolcanic eruptions.\nVolcanoes can cause widespread destruction and consequent disaster in several ways. One hazard is the volcanic eruption itself, with the force of the explosion and falling rocks able to cause harm. Lava may also be released during the eruption of a volcano; as it leaves the volcano, it can destroy buildings, plants and animals due to its extreme heat. In addition, volcanic ash may form a cloud (generally after cooling) and settle thickly in nearby locations. When mixed with water, this forms a concrete-like material. In sufficient quantities, ash may cause roofs to collapse under its weight. Even small quantities will harm humans if inhaled \u2013 it has the consistency of ground glass and therefore causes laceration to the throat and lungs. Volcanic ash can also cause abrasion damage to moving machinery such as engines. The main killer of humans in the immediate surroundings of a volcanic eruption is pyroclastic flows, consisting of a cloud of hot ash which builds up in the air above the volcano and rushes down the slopes when the eruption no longer supports the lifting of the gases. It is believed that Pompeii was destroyed by a pyroclastic flow. A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or landslide. The 1953 Tangiwai disaster was caused by a lahar, as was the 1985 Armero tragedy in which the town of Armero was buried and an estimated 23,000 people were killed.\nVolcanoes rated at 8 (the highest level) on the volcanic explosivity index are known as supervolcanoes. According to the Toba catastrophe theory, 75,000 to 80,000 years ago, a supervolcanic eruption at what is now Lake Toba in Sumatra reduced the human population to 10,000 or even 1,000 breeding pairs, creating a bottleneck in human evolution, and killed three-quarters of all plant life in the northern hemisphere. However, there is considerable debate regarding the veracity of this theory. The main danger from a supervolcano is the immense cloud of ash, which has a disastrous global effect on climate and temperature for many years.\nTsunami.\nA tsunami (plural: tsunamis or tsunami; from Japanese: \u6d25\u6ce2, lit. \"harbour wave\"; English pronunciation: /tsu\u02d0\u02c8n\u0251\u02d0mi/), also known as a seismic sea wave or tidal wave, is a series of waves in a water body caused by the displacement of a large volume of water, generally in an ocean or a large lake. Tsunamis can be caused by undersea earthquakes such as the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, or by landslides such as the one in 1958 at Lituya Bay, Alaska, or by volcanic eruptions such as the ancient eruption of Santorini. On March 11, 2011, a tsunami occurred near Fukushima, Japan and spread through the Pacific Ocean.\nDisasters caused by extreme weather hazards.\nSome of the 18 natural hazards included in the National Risk Index of FEMA now have a higher probability of occurring, and at higher intensity, due to the effects of climate change. This applies to heat waves, droughts, wildfire and coastal flooding.\nHot and dry conditions.\nHeat waves.\nA heat wave is a period of unusually and excessively hot weather. Heat waves used to be rare, requiring specific combinations of weather events to take place, such as temperature inversions, katabatic winds, or other phenomena. Since the turn of this century, under the continuing pressure of global warming, many areas have experienced peaks of temperatures, along with more frequent, more intense, more prolonged warming events than ever met on record. This is notably the case in many ocean regions such as the Mediterranean Sea. On land heat waves coupled with severe winds are now causing hundreds of major wildfires every year, burning thousands of square kilometers of forests, and threatening the very heart of cities as observed in the January 2025 megafires that destroyed several sectors of Los Angeles.\nDroughts.\nWell-known historical droughts include the 1997\u20132009 Millennium Drought in Australia which led to a water supply crisis across much of the country. As a result, many desalination plants were built for the first time (see list). In 2011, the State of Texas lived under a drought emergency declaration for the entire calendar year and suffered severe economic losses. The drought caused the Bastrop fires.\nWildfires.\nWildfires are large fires which often start in wildland areas. Common causes include lightning and drought but wildfires may also be started by human negligence or arson. They can spread to populated areas and thus be a threat to humans and property, as well as wildlife. One example for a notable wildfire is the 1871 Peshtigo Fire in the United States, which killed at least 1700 people. Another one is the 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia (collectively known as \"Black Saturday bushfires\"). In that year, a summer heat wave in Victoria, Australia, created conditions which fueled the massive bushfires in 2009. Melbourne experienced three days in a row of temperatures exceeding 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F), with some regional areas sweltering through much higher temperatures.\nStorms and heavy rain.\nFloods.\nA flood is an overflow of water that 'submerges' land. The EU Floods Directive defines a flood as a temporary covering of land that is usually dry with water. In the sense of 'flowing water', the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tides. Flooding may result from the volume of a body of water, such as a river or lake, becoming higher than usual, causing some of the water to escape its usual boundaries. While the size of a lake or other body of water will vary with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt, a flood is not considered significant unless the water covers land used by humans, such as a village, city or other inhabited area, roads or expanses of farmland.\nThunderstorms.\nSevere storms, dust clouds and volcanic eruptions can generate lightning. Apart from the damage typically associated with storms, such as winds, hail and flooding, the lightning itself can damage buildings, ignite fires and kill by direct contact. Most deaths from lightning occur in the poorer countries of the Americas and Asia, where lightning is common and adobe mud brick housing provides little protection.\nTropical cyclone.\nTyphoon, cyclone, cyclonic storm and hurricane are different names for the same phenomenon: a tropical storm that forms over an ocean. It is caused by evaporated water that comes off of the ocean and becomes a storm. It is characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. The determining factor on which term is used is based on where the storm originates. In the Atlantic and Northeast Pacific, the term \"hurricane\" is used; in the Northwest Pacific, it is referred to as a \"typhoon\"; a \"cyclone\" occurs in the South Pacific and Indian Ocean.\nThe deadliest hurricane ever was the 1970 Bhola cyclone; the deadliest Atlantic hurricane was the Great Hurricane of 1780, which devastated Martinique, St. Eustatius and Barbados. Another notable hurricane is Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast of the United States in 2005. Hurricanes may become more intense and produce more heavy rainfall as a consequence of human-induced climate change.\nTornadoes.\nA tornado is a violent and dangerous rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud, or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. It is also referred to as a \"twister\" or a \"cyclone\", although the word cyclone is used in meteorology in a wider sense to refer to any closed low pressure circulation. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes but typically take the form of a visible condensation funnel, the narrow end of which touches the Earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. Tornadoes can occur one at a time, or can occur in large tornado outbreaks associated with supercells or in other large areas of thunderstorm development.\nMost tornadoes have wind speeds of less than , are approximately across, and travel a few kilometers before dissipating. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than , attain a width exceeding across, and stay on the ground for perhaps more than .\nCold-weather events.\nBlizzards.\nBlizzards are severe winter storms characterized by heavy snow and strong winds. When high winds stir up snow that has already fallen, it is known as a ground blizzard. Blizzards can impact local economic activities, especially in regions where snowfall is rare. The Great Blizzard of 1888 affected the United States, when many tons of wheat crops were destroyed. In Asia, the 1972 Iran blizzard and the 2008 Afghanistan blizzard, were the deadliest blizzards in history; in the former, an area the size of Wisconsin was entirely buried in snow. The 1993 Superstorm originated in the Gulf of Mexico and traveled north, causing damage in 26 American states as well as in Canada and leading to more than 300 deaths.\nHailstorms.\nHail is precipitation in the form of ice that does not melt before it hits the ground. Hailstorms are produced by thunderstorms. Hailstones usually measure between in diameter. These can damage the location in which they fall. Hailstorms can be especially devastating to farm fields, ruining crops and damaging equipment. A particularly damaging hailstorm hit Munich, Germany, on July 12, 1984, causing about $2 billion in insurance claims.\nMulti-hazard analysis.\nEach of the natural hazard types outlined above have very different characteristics, in terms of the spatial and temporal scales they influence, hazard frequency and return period, and measures of intensity and impact. These complexities result in \"single-hazard\" assessments being commonplace, where the hazard potential from one particular hazard type is constrained. In these examples, hazards are often treated as isolated or independent. An alternative is a \"multi-hazard\" approach which seeks to identify all possible natural hazards and their interactions or interrelationships.\nMany examples exist of one natural hazard triggering or increasing the probability of one or more other natural hazards. For example, an earthquake may trigger landslides, whereas a wildfire may increase the probability of landslides being generated in the future. A detailed review of such interactions across 21 natural hazards identified 90 possible interactions, of varying likelihood and spatial importance. There may also be interactions between these natural hazards and anthropic processes. For example, groundwater abstraction may trigger groundwater-related subsidence.\nEffective hazard analysis in any given area (e.g., for the purposes of disaster risk reduction) should ideally include an examination of all relevant hazards and their interactions. To be of most use for risk reduction, hazard analysis should be extended to risk assessment wherein the vulnerability of the built environment to each of the hazards is taken into account. This step is well developed for seismic risk, where the possible effect of future earthquakes on structures and infrastructure is assessed, as well as for risk from extreme wind and to a lesser extent flood risk. For other types of natural hazard the calculation of risk is more challenging, principally because of the lack of functions linking the intensity of a hazard and the probability of different levels of damage (fragility curves).\nResponses.\nDisaster management is a main function of civil protection (or civil defense) authorities.

{"id": "58925", "revid": "5183450", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58925", "title": "Margrethe II", "text": "Queen of Denmark from 1972 to 2024\nMargrethe II (; Margrethe Alexandrine \u00de\u00f3rhildur Ingrid, born 16 April 1940) is a member of the Danish royal family who reigned as Queen of Denmark from 14 January 1972 until her abdication on 14 January 2024. Having reigned for exactly 52 years, she was the second-longest-reigning Danish monarch after Christian IV.\nMargrethe was born into the House of Gl\u00fccksburg, a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, King Christian X. She is the eldest child of King Frederik IX and Queen Ingrid. She became heir presumptive to her father in 1953 when a constitutional amendment allowed women to inherit the throne. In 1967 she married Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, with whom she had two sons, Frederik and Joachim. Margrethe succeeded her father upon his death in January 1972.\nMargrethe has worked as a scenographer, a costume designer, and an illustrator of works by J. R. R. Tolkien. Support for the monarchy in Denmark, alongside her personal popularity, gradually rose throughout the course of her reign, attaining around eighty per cent by the time of her abdication. She was succeeded by her elder son, Frederik X.\nEarly life and education.\nMargrethe was born on 16 April 1940 at 10:10 CET at Frederik VIII's Palace, in her parents' residence at Amalienborg, the principal residence of the Danish royal family in the district of Frederiksstaden in central Copenhagen. She was the first child of Crown Prince Frederik (later King Frederik IX) and Crown Princess Ingrid (later Queen Ingrid). Her father was the elder son of the then-reigning King Christian X, while her mother was the only daughter of Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden (later King Gustaf VI Adolf). Her birth took place just one week after the beginning of Nazi Germany's occupation of Denmark following the war invasion.\nMargrethe was baptised on 14 May in the Holmen Church in Copenhagen. Her godparents were her grandfathers, King Christian X of Denmark and Crown Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden; her maternal great-grandfathers, King Gustaf V of Sweden and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn; her uncles Prince Knud of Denmark and Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of V\u00e4sterbotten; as well as her first cousin twice removed, Prince Axel of Denmark. She was named Margrethe\u2014the Danish variation of her late maternal grandmother Crown Princess Margareta of Sweden's name\u2014Alexandrine after her paternal grandmother, Queen Alexandrine, and Ingrid after her mother. Since her paternal grandfather was also King of Iceland at the time of her birth, she was given the Icelandic name \u00de\u00f3rhildur (\"Thor's battle\" or \"Thor's strength\"). Like her maternal grandmother, Margrethe is known affectionately as \"Daisy\" to her family and close friends.\nThe birth of Margrethe's younger sisters Benedikte and Anne-Marie followed in 1944 and 1946, respectively. The princesses grew up in apartments at Frederik VIII's Palace at Amalienborg in Copenhagen and in Fredensborg Palace in North Zealand. Margrethe spent summer holidays with the royal family in her parents' summer residence at Gr\u00e5sten Palace in Southern Jutland. On 20 April 1947, following the death of Christian X, Margrethe's father acceded to the throne as Frederik IX.\nEducation.\nMargrethe was educated at the private school N. Zahle's School in Copenhagen, from which she graduated in 1959. She spent a year at North Foreland Lodge, a boarding school for girls in Hampshire, England, and later studied prehistoric archaeology at Girton College, Cambridge, during 1960\u20131961, and political science at Aarhus University between 1961 and 1962, attended the Sorbonne in 1963, and was at the London School of Economics in 1965. She is a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.\nHeir presumptive.\nAt the time of her birth, only males could accede to the throne of Denmark, owing to the changes in succession laws enacted in the 1850s when the Gl\u00fccksburg branch was chosen to succeed. As Margrethe had no brothers, it was assumed that her uncle Prince Knud would one day assume the throne.\nThe process of changing the constitution started in 1947, not long after Margrethe's father acceded to the throne and it became clear that Queen Ingrid would have no more children. The popularity of Frederik and his daughters and the more prominent role of women in Danish life started the complicated process of altering the constitution. The law required that the proposal be passed by two successive Parliaments and then by a referendum, which occurred on 27 March 1953. The new Act of Succession permitted female succession to the throne of Denmark, according to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, where a female can accede to the throne only if she does not have a brother. Princess Margrethe therefore became heir presumptive. In 2009, the law of succession was modified into absolute primogeniture.\nMargrethe attended the traditional New Year Courts for the first time in 1956. On her eighteenth birthday, 16 April 1958, Margrethe was given a seat in the Council of State. She subsequently chaired the meetings of the Council in the absence of the King. In 1960, with her first cousin, Princess Margaretha of Sweden, and Princess Astrid of Norway, she travelled to the United States, which included a visit to Los Angeles, and to the Paramount Studios, where they met several celebrities, including Dean Martin, Jerry Lewis and Elvis Presley.\nShe paid her first visit to the Faroe Islands in 1959, alongside her parents and sisters, and to Greenland in 1960.\nMarriage and family.\nWhile Margrethe studied in London, she met the French diplomat Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, who was legation secretary at the French Embassy in London. Their engagement was announced on 5 October 1966. They were married on 10 June 1967, at the Holmen Church in Copenhagen, and the wedding reception was held at Fredensborg Palace. Laborde de Monpezat received the style and title of \"His Royal Highness Prince Henrik of Denmark\" because of his new position as the spouse of the heir presumptive to the Danish throne. They were married for more than fifty years, until his death on 13 February 2018.\nLess than a year after the wedding, Margrethe gave birth to her first child, a son, on 26 May 1968. By tradition, Danish kings were alternately named either Frederik or Christian. She chose to maintain this by assuming the position of a Christian, and thus named her elder son Frederik. The following year, a second child, named Joachim, was born on 7 June 1969.\nIn 1974, she and Henrik purchased Ch\u00e2teau de Cayx in the wine district of Cahors in Southern France.\nMargrethe announced in 2008 that her male-line descendants would bear the additional title of Count or Countess of Monpezat in recognition of her husband's ancestry.\nIn 2022, the Queen announced that, from the start of 2023, the descendants of Prince Joachim will only be able to use their titles of Count and Countess of Monpezat, their previous titles of Prince and Princess of Denmark ceasing to exist. To allow the children, who were never expected to hold an official role within the royal family, to have normal lives, the Queen wanted \"to create a framework for the four grandchildren, to a much greater degree, to be able to shape their own existence without being limited by the special considerations and obligations that a formal affiliation with the Royal House as an institution implies\". Her son, Joachim, daughter-in-law, Marie, former daughter-in-law, Alexandra, and eldest grandson, Nikolai, publicly expressed shock and confusion because of the decision, after which Margrethe released a statement in which she said that it saddened her that she had upset Joachim's family.\nAlong with her late husband, Margrethe has kept dachshunds since the 1970s. She currently has one dog, the dachshund Tilia, who was Prince Henrik's dog until his death in 2018.\nReign.\nAccession.\nOn 3 January 1972, three days after King Frederik IX delivered his New Year's address, he suffered a heart attack and was admitted to the Copenhagen Municipal Hospital. Margrethe was then designated regent the following day. The King died on 14 January, and Margrethe acceded to the throne at the age of 31, becoming the first female Danish sovereign under the new Act of Succession. She was proclaimed Queen from the balcony of Christiansborg Palace the following day by Prime Minister Jens Otto Krag.\nHer regnal number was chosen in recognition of the 14th century Danish monarch, Margrethe. Her motto was \"God's help, the love of the people, Denmark's strength\" (). She relinquished all the monarch's former titles except the title to Denmark, hence her style \"By the Grace of God, Queen of Denmark\" ().\nConstitutional role.\nThe Queen's main tasks were to represent the kingdom abroad and to be a unifying figure at home. She performed the latter by opening exhibitions, attending anniversaries and inaugurating bridges, among other things. She received foreign ambassadors and awards, honours and medals.\nAs a constitutional sovereign, Margrethe took no part in party politics and does not express any political opinions. Although she had the right to vote, she opted not to do so to avoid even the appearance of partisanship.\nThe Queen held a meeting with the prime minister and the foreign affairs minister every Wednesday, unless either she or the prime minister was outside of the kingdom.\nAfter an election where the incumbent prime minister does not have a majority behind him or her, the Queen held a \"\" (Queen's meeting) in which she met the chairmen of each of the Danish political parties.\nEach party has the choice of selecting a royal investigator to lead these negotiations or alternatively, give the incumbent prime minister the mandate to continue his or her government as is. In theory each party could choose its own leader as royal investigator, as the social liberal did in 2006, but often only one royal investigator is chosen plus the prime minister, before each election. The leader who, at that meeting, succeeds in securing a majority of the seats in the Folketing, is, by royal decree, charged with the task of forming a new government. (No party has held an absolute majority in the Folketing since 1903.)\nOnce the government had been formed, the Queen formally appointed it. Officially, it was the monarch who was the head of state, and she therefore presided over the Council of State (privy council), where the acts of legislation which have been passed by the parliament are signed into law. In practice, nearly all of the Queen's formal powers were exercised by the Cabinet of Denmark.\nIt was customary for Margrethe, as the Danish monarch, to host the annual New Year lev\u00e9es. Every year on 1 January, a banquet was held for the government, the Speaker of the Danish Parliament, representatives of official Denmark and the Royal Court at Christian VIII's Palace at Amalienborg. On day two, a lev\u00e9e was held at Christian VIII's Palace for the justices of Supreme Court of Denmark and the Officer Corps of the Royal Life Guards and the Guard Hussar Regiment, followed by a lev\u00e9e at Christiansborg Palace for the diplomatic corps. On day three, a lev\u00e9e was held for officers from the Ministry of Defence and the Danish Emergency Management Agency, the I., II. and III. ranking classes as well as invited representatives of major national organisations and the royal patronages.\nOfficial duties.\nUp to the end of her reign, Margrethe held 72 Danish and eight foreign patronages as queen, including Aarhus Festuge, ARoS Aarhus Kunstmuseum, DaneAge Association, Danes Worldwide, the Danish Animal Welfare Society, the Danish Cancer Society, Den Gamle By, Det Classenske Fideicommis, the Danish Bible Society, Det Kongelige Vajsenhus, Diakonissestiftelsen, Foreningen Norden, Land of Legends (Sagnlandet Lejre), M/S Maritime Museum of Denmark, Moesgaard Museum, National Olympic Committee and Sports Confederation of Denmark, Nyborg Slot, Rebild National Park, the Royal Danish Academy of Music, Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, Royal Danish Yacht Club, Rungstedlund Foundation, Sankt Lukas Stiftelsen, Vall\u00f8 stift and Vemmetofte.\nA pillar of her reign was an intricate knowledge of and connection to all parts of the Danish Realm. In 2016, she contributed to a book about Denmark's history.\nUntil her abdication, Margrethe served as colonel-in-chief of the Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, an infantry regiment of the British Army, following a tradition dating back to 1906 when Edward VII, married to Alexandra of Denmark, appointed his brother-in-law, Frederik VIII of Denmark, colonel-in-chief of the then Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment).\nAs sovereign, Margrethe received 42 official state visits and she undertook 55 foreign state visits herself. She and the royal family have made several other foreign visits.\nResidences.\nAs queen, her official residences were Amalienborg (where she resides at Christian IX's Palace) in Copenhagen and Fredensborg Palace near Hiller\u00f8d. Her summer residences were Marselisborg Palace near Aarhus and Gr\u00e5sten Palace near S\u00f8nderborg, the former home of her mother, Queen Ingrid, who died in 2000.\nImmigration debate.\nIn her New Year's address at the end of 1984, the Queen addressed the xenophobia experienced by many immigrants in Denmark: &lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;We have the peace, the free political life and social relations that make our country a sought-after haven for many. Refugees from very different backgrounds come here, sometimes injured in both mind and body. We welcome them and are probably also a little proud that they have chosen our little paradise, but when we see them fumbling with our way of life and our language, hospitality becomes difficult all too quickly, and disappointment sets in on both sides. There are also others who have felt that, namely the guest workers and their families (...) Then we come with our 'Danish humour' and little cocky remarks. Then we meet them with coolness, and then it is not far to harassment and rougher methods\u2014we cannot allow that. If we want the new year to be better than the old, then here is a good place to start.\nThe term \"cocky remarks\" (, lit.\u2009'dumb-slick remarks') has since become an integrated part of the Danish vocabulary.\nIn an interview within the 2016 book (\"The Deepest Roots\"), according to historians at the Saxo Institute of the University of Copenhagen, Margrethe showed a change in attitude to immigration towards a more conservative stance. She stated that the Danish people should have more explicitly clarified the rules and values of Danish culture in order to be able to teach them to new arrivals. She further stated that the Danes in general have underestimated the difficulties involved in successful integration of immigrants, exemplified with the rules of a democracy not being clarified to Muslim immigrants and a lack of readiness to enforce those rules. This was received as a change in line with the attitude of the Danish people.\nSilver, Ruby and Golden Jubilees.\nMargrethe marked her Silver Jubilee in 1997 with a religious service and a gala dinner attended by fellow Scandinavian royals. She celebrated her Ruby Jubilee, the 40th year on the throne, on 14 January 2012. This was marked by a church service, concert, carriage procession, gala banquet at Christiansborg Palace and numerous TV interviews.\nThe Queen's Golden Jubilee was marked on 14 January 2022, with celebrations to take place later in the year. In September, following the death of Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, it was announced by the Royal House that it was \"Her Majesty The Queen's wish that a number of adjustments be made\" to the upcoming celebrations.\nBetween Elizabeth II's death and her abdication, Margrethe was Europe's longest-reigning monarch, the world's only queen regnant, and the longest-serving incumbent female head of state.\nSitting reign record.\nIn July 2023, the Danish Royal House recognized Margrethe II as Denmark's longest-reigning sitting monarch. Though Christian IV reigned for more than 59 years between 1588 and 1648, he was not officially installed until 1596, ruling with a \"guardian government\" up until then.\nAbdication.\nIn her annual live broadcast New Year's Eve address on 31 December 2023, Margrethe announced her abdication, which took place on 14 January 2024, the 52nd anniversary of her accession to the throne. She said that time had taken its \"toll\", that her number of \"ailments\" had increased, and that she cannot undertake as many duties as in the past. She cited her extensive back surgery in February, and said that the operation made her reassess her position and consider \"whether now would be an appropriate time to pass on the responsibility to the next generation\".\nMargrethe's elder son, Frederik, assumed the throne as Frederik X. Mirroring her first New Year Address in 1973, she said of the succession: \"The support and assistance which I have received throughout the years, have been crucial to the success of my task. It is my hope that the new King and Queen will be met with the same trust and devotion which have fallen to my lot.\"\nSince her abdication, she has been referred to as \"Her Majesty Queen Margrethe\". She is eligible to serve as regent in the event of the incapacity or absence of the King and Crown Prince Christian. As regent, Margrethe can perform the duties of the head of state on certain occasions, for example during Frederik and Christian's stays abroad.\nHealth issues.\nQueen Margrethe II has had a number of health issues. Since the 1990s, she has undergone several operations on her right knee due to injuries and osteoarthritis. In 1994, she was treated for cervical cancer. In 2003, she underwent a four-and-a-half-hour-long operation for spinal stenosis.\nOn 9 February 2022, the Danish court disclosed in a press release that the Queen had contracted COVID-19. On 13 February, the Queen was able to leave home isolation after having had a mild case of the virus. On 21 September 2022, the Danish Royal House disclosed in a press release that Margrethe had tested positive for COVID-19 a second time after attending the state funeral of Elizabeth II, her third cousin, in London. She left home isolation again on 26 September and resumed her official duties immediately, stating that she felt fine.\nOn 22 February 2023, the Queen underwent \"major back surgery\" at Rigshospitalet due to continued back pain. In a statement the following day, a representative for the Queen said that the surgery had gone well and that she had already been up for a walk. She was discharged from the hospital on 2 March, and returned from sick leave on her birthday on 16 April.\nMargrethe has been a chain smoker and is well known for her tobacco habit. On 23 November 2006, the Danish newspaper \"B.T.\" printed an announcement from the Royal Court that the Queen would henceforth smoke only in private.\nIn September 2024, she was hospitalised after falling in Fredensborg Castle.\nPublic image and style.\nMargrethe wears designs by former Pierre Balmain designer Erik Mortensen, J\u00f8rgen Bender, and Birgitte Taulow. In March 2013, \"The Guardian\" listed her as one of the fifty best-dressed over-50s. In connection with her 80th birthday, British \"Vogue\" published an article calling her \"An Unsung Style Heroine.\"\nA 2012 poll showed support for the monarchy in Denmark remained consistently high at around 82%, compared to less than half when she acceded to the throne in 1972.\nThe Queen has been depicted on the annual christmas seal twice\u2014as a child in 1942 and following her accession to the throne in 1972. \nMargrethe was included in Andy Warhol's portrait series in 1985 as one of four \"Reigning Queens\", along with queens Ntfombi of Eswatini, Elizabeth II and Beatrix of the Netherlands.\nPersonal interests.\nArchaeology.\nMargrethe is known for her strong archaeological passion and has participated in several excavations, including in Italy, Egypt, Denmark and South America. She shared this interest with her grandfather, Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, with whom she spent some time unearthing artefacts near Etruria in 1962.\nChurch textiles.\nSince the 1970s, Margrethe has designed and embroidered several vestments and church textiles for churches in Denmark, Greenland, Germany and England. She has designed a chasuble for Fredensborg Palace Church which was since embroidered by her mother, Queen Ingrid, and appliqu\u00e9d by her sister, Princess Benedikte. The textile was presented to the church on its 250th anniversary in 1976. In 1989, Margrethe designed the bishop's robe for the Diocese of Viborg. In 2017, she designed the antependium for the All Saints' Church, Wittenberg, Germany. In 2020, she designed the chasuble for the Danish Church of St Katharine in the London Borough of Camden.\nIn addition to the church textiles, Margrethe has various other things, including an altarpiece for Skei Mountain Church in Norway, a Christmas spoon, the annual Danish Christmas seals in 1970, 2003 and 2015, and Greenland's Christmas seal in 1983.\nD\u00e9coupage.\nSince the mid-1970s, Margrethe has been using the d\u00e9coupage technique, which involves combining clippings from periodicals and books for new motifs. This technique is used in auction catalogues, home magazines, and furniture decorations. The d\u00e9coupage often references literary, mythological, or art-historical topics, and is often displayed in royal palaces, particularly Christian VII's Palace at Amalienborg. Sealed with a protective lacquer, the Queen's d\u00e9coupage works generally have references to literary, mythological or art-historical topics.\nMargrethe's d\u00e9coupage works have also been used in various books and films, including Prince Henrik's poetry collections \"Cantabile\" (2000) and \"Frihjul\" (2010). Eighty-one d\u00e9coupages she designed were the basis for the sets of the 2023 film \"\".\nEmbroidery.\nAs a child, Margrethe preferred drawing rather than needlework, but since 1960, numerous embroideries have been presented as gifts or used in the Queen's own rooms. The embroideries are made from patterns that Margrethe herself creates on graph paper, which includes twining shapes and the recipient's monogram. The Queen has designed several embroideries for the Danish Handcraft Guild, including patterns for calendars, cushion covers and dinner mats. Margrethe has also designed evening bags and spectacle cases for friends and family members, including Christmas calendars for all of the grandchildren, cushion covers and furniture covers for the palaces, and fireplace screens for Fredensborg Palace.\nThe Queen's private embroideries were exhibited at Koldinghus Castle in 2021.\nFilms.\nThe Queen has worked as a screenwriter alongside Per Brink Abrahamsen on the two Hans Christian Andersen adaptations \"The Snow Queen\" from 2000 and \"The Wild Swans\" from 2009. Additionally, she narrated the former and made an uncredited acting cameo as a \"member of the mob\" in the latter.\nUsing decoupage as her primary craft, she has also been a set designer for:\nFor her work on \"Ehrengard: The Art of Seduction\", Margrethe won the Robert Award for Best Costume Design at the 41st Robert Awards on 3 February 2024. She was also nominated in the category Best Production Design.\nMonograms.\nIn 2004, Margrethe designed the official monogram of her second cousin twice removed, Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway. She has also designed her own personal monogram; the personal monograms of her son Frederik X, daughter-in-law Mary and grandson Christian; as well as the joint monograms of the Danish Crown Prince couple as well as the Norwegian Crown Prince couple, her godson Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway, and his wife Mette-Marit.\nScenography and costume design.\nOver the years, Margrethe has become involved in ballet as a scenographer and costume designer. She designed the costumes for the Royal Danish Ballet's production of \"A Folk Tale\" and for the 2009 Peter Flinth film, \"De vilde svaner\" (\"The Wild Swans\"). She also designs her own clothes and is known for her colourful and sometimes eccentric clothing choices. The Queen designed 51 costumes for the 2023 film \"\" as well as 81 d\u00e9coupages that were the basis for the sets.\nMargrethe has designed sets and costumes for numerous ballets. Since 2001, she has worked with the Tivoli Ballet Theatre:\nVisual art.\nMargrethe is an accomplished painter and has exhibited many of her works over the years. In 2000, she illustrated Prince Henrik's poetry collection \"Cantabile\". Under the title \"From mountains to coast\", she and her close friend, Queen Sonja of Norway, exhibited selected works inspired by nature at the Barony Rosendal in 2015.\nUnder the pseudonym \"Ingahild Grathmer\" (the latter being an anagram for Margrethe and the former made up of her secondary names Ingrid, Alexandrine and \u00de\u00f3rhildur), her illustrations were used for Danish editions of \"The Lord of the Rings\", which she was encouraged to illustrate in the early 1970s. She sent them to J. R. R. Tolkien, who was struck by the similarity of her drawings to his own style. \nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58926", "revid": "50815760", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58926", "title": "Presbyterian polity", "text": "Church government by assemblies of elders\nPresbyterian or presbyteral polity is a method of church governance (\"ecclesiastical polity\") typified by the rule of assemblies of presbyters, or elders. Each local church is governed by a body of elected elders usually called the session (or consistory), though other terms, such as \"church board\", may apply. Groups of local churches are governed by a higher assembly of elders known as the presbytery or classis; presbyteries can be grouped into a synod, and presbyteries and synods nationwide often join together in a general assembly. Responsibility for conduct of church services is reserved to an ordained minister or pastor known as a \"teaching elder\", or a \"minister of the word and sacrament.\"\nPresbyterian polity was developed as a rejection of governance by hierarchies of single bishops (episcopal polity), but also differs from the congregationalist polity in which each congregation is independent. In contrast to the other two forms, authority in the presbyterian polity flows both from the top down (as higher assemblies exercise limited but important authority over individual congregations, e.g., only the presbytery can ordain ministers, install pastors, and start up, close, and approve relocating a congregation) and from the bottom up (e.g., the moderator and officers are not appointed from above but are rather elected by and from among the members of the assembly). This theory of governance developed in Geneva under John Calvin and was introduced to Scotland by John Knox after his period of exile in Geneva. It is strongly associated with French, Dutch, Swiss and Scottish Reformation movements, and the Reformed and Presbyterian churches.\nHistory.\nAmong the early church fathers, it was noted that the offices of elder and bishop were identical, and were not differentiated until later, and that plurality of elders was the norm for church government. St. Jerome (347\u2013420) \"In Epistle Titus\", vol. iv, said, \"Elder is identical with bishop; and before the urging of the devil gave rise to factionalism in religion, so much that it was being said among the people, 'I am of Paul, I of Apollos, I of Cephas', the churches were governed by a joint council of elders. After it was... decreed throughout the world that one chosen from among the presbyters should be placed over the others.\" This observation was also made by Chrysostom (349\u2013407) in \"Homilia i, in Phil. i, 1\" and Theodoret (393\u2013457) in \"Interpret ad. Phil. iii\", 445.\nAerius of Sebaste also attacked the episcopal polity in the 4th century.\nPresbyterianism was first described in detail by Martin Bucer of Strasbourg, who believed that the early Christian church implemented presbyterian polity. The first modern implementation was by the Geneva church under the leadership of John Calvin in 1541.\nIn the early days of the Scottish Reformation there were Superintendents. There were also Tulchan Bishops and Archbishops. Much of the history of the Church of Scotland and the nation itself is bound up with the relation between Episcopalianism, which the Protestant monarchs favoured, and the Presbyterianism of the reformers. In the Hungarian Reformed Church there remain bishops who have a superintending role.\nBasis.\nPresbyterian polity is constructed on specific assumptions about the form of the government intended by the Bible:\nPresbyterianism uses a conciliar method of church government (that is, leadership by the group or council). Thus, the ministers and \"elders\" govern together as a group, and at all times the office is for the service of the congregation, to pray for them and to encourage them in the faith. The elders together exercise oversight (episcopacy) over the local congregation, with superior groups of elders gathered on a regional basis exercising wider oversight.\nPresbyterians typically have viewed this method of government as approximating that of the New Testament and earliest churches.\nPresbyterianism is also distinct from congregationalism, in that individual congregations are not independent, but are answerable to the wider church, through its governing bodies (presbyteries, synods and assemblies). Moreover, the ordained ministry possesses a distinct responsibility for preaching and sacraments. Congregational churches are sometimes called \"Presbyterian\" if they are governed by a council of elders; but the difference is that every local congregation is independent, and its elders are accountable to its members, and congregationalism's wider assemblies are not ordinarily empowered to enforce discipline. Thus, these are ruled by elders only at the level of the congregations, which are united with one another by covenants of trust.\nOffices.\nElder.\nThere are two types of elder; the \"teaching elder\" (see \"Minister\" below) and the \"ruling elder\".\nAn excerpt from Miller (1831) expands this.Chapter 1\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In every Church completely organized, that is, furnished with all the officers which Christ has instituted and which are necessary for carrying into full effect the laws of his kingdom, there ought to be three classes of officers, viz: at least one Teaching Elder, Bishop, or Pastor \u2014 a bench of Ruling Elders \u2014 and Deacons. The first to \"minister in the Word and Doctrine\", and to dispense the sacraments; \u2014 the second to assist in the inspection and government of the Church; \u2014 and the third to \"serve tables\"; that is, to take care of the Church's funds destined for the support of the poor, and sometimes to manage whatever relates to the temporal support of the gospel and its ministers.\nDepending upon the specific denomination, teaching elders may also be referred to with terms such as \"Minister of Word and Sacrament\".\nThe elders are persons chosen from among the congregation and ordained for this service. Beyond that, practices vary: sometimes elders are elected by the congregation, sometimes appointed by the session, in some denominations elders serve for life, others have fixed terms, and some churches appoint elders on a rotation from among willing members in good standing in the church. However, in many churches, ruling elders retain their ordination for life, even though they serve fixed terms. Even after the end of their terms, they may be active in presbyteries or other bodies, and may serve communion.\nIn addition to sitting on the session and other church courts, ruling elders have duties as individuals. Again, Miller (1831) explains,\nChapter 9\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It is their duty to have an eye of inspection and care over all the members of the congregation; and, for this purpose, to cultivate a universal and intimate acquaintance, as far as may be, with every family in the flock of which they are made \"overseers\".\nMinister.\nIn some denominations they are called \"Ministers of Word and Sacrament\", and in others they are called \"Teaching Elders\". Ministers called to a particular congregation are called \"pastors\", and serve a function analogous to clergy in other denominations. (Because ruling elders are often ordained in a fashion nearly identical to teaching elders, the distinction between lay and clergy is not as clear under the Presbyterian system as in others). The terms 'lay' and 'clergy' are not properly used in presbyterian polity.\nMinisters may be considered equal in status with the other elders, but they have a distinct ordination and distinct function. They are the primary preachers and teachers, celebrants of sacraments. There are sometimes further distinctions between the minister and the other elders. Some Presbyterian denominations enroll ministers as members of their respective congregations, while others enroll the minister as a member of the regional presbytery. The presbyteries are responsible for the ordination of the ministers.\nUntil the 20th century, only men had been eligible for ordination as elders or ministers of the word and sacrament.\nThis is widely not the case any longer, although it is usually considered a demarcation issue, distinguishing \"liberal\" from \"conservative\" Presbyterian denominations. In North America, the Reformed Church in America, Christian Reformed Church in North America (both of Dutch Reformed heritage), Cumberland Presbyterian Church, ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians, Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Presbyterian Church in Canada, and Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) are denominations with presbyterian polity which allow for the ordination of women.\nThe general assembly of a denomination often decides on what grounds a person may be ordained, but the ordination of ministers is the right of the presbytery or classis, and the right to extend a call to a minister is the privilege of the members of the parish or congregation.\nDeacon.\nThe office of deacon has different meanings among different presbyterian churches. In some churches, deacons exercise responsibility for practical matters of finance and fabric, either separately or together with the elders.\nIn some cases deacons administer the welfare matters of the congregation, while a separate board of management or trustees administers the other material business (temporalities) of the congregation, such as its endowments, salaries and buildings.\nGoverning bodies.\nSession.\nA session is a corporate body of teaching and ruling elders elected by a particular church. \"sessio\" from \"sedere\" \"to sit\"), sometimes the \"Kirk session\", \"church session,\" or (in Continental Reformed usage) \"consistory\". In some Continental Reformed churches, deacons are members of the consistory; others, such as the Christian Reformed Church in North America, distinguish between the consistory, comprising the pastor and elders, and the council, which comprises the pastor(s), the elders, and the deacons.\nIn most denominations the pastor serves as Moderator and presides over the session (primus inter pares), in which all elders have an equal vote.Chapter 9 In some denominations, the pastor is not given a vote; however, in a sitting body of an even number or with a quorum of the session counted they can break a tie by a casting vote.\nIn the Polity of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the pastor and associate pastor(s), if elected by the congregation and \"installed\" to a permanent pastorate by the presbytery, have votes as members of the session on any and all matters; however, often they refrain from voting except in tie situations. The Pastor is not a voting member of the congregation.\nWith the Session there is one person, usually an elder but not always, who will be given the title, \"Clerk of Session\". This person is more or less the secretary for Session. They take notes on each meeting and are responsible for records of the congregation. In addition they find a wide area of responsibility, including responsibility for conduct of worship should a minister suddenly not be available. Although it is the responsibility of the Moderator (minister), Session Clerks often have the ability to assist in keeping meetings on track due to skills which are received from experience and the Holy Spirit.\nPresbytery.\nIn presbyterianism, congregations are united in accountability to a regional body called the \"presbytery, \"or, in Continental Reformed terminology, the \"classis\", which comes from the Latin word for \"fleet\". Presbyteries are made up of all the teaching and ruling elders in a particular geographic region. In some Dutch Reformed bodies, a classis serves as a delegated body, which ceases to exist in between meetings, whereas a presbytery exists perpetually.\nThe officers of a presbytery are a moderator and a stated or principal clerk. The moderator acts as chair of presbytery meetings. As with the moderators of synods and assemblies, the moderatorship is a primus inter pares position appointed by the presbytery itself. The moderator is addressed as \"moderator\" during meetings, but their position has no bearing outside of the presbytery meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts, although typically the moderator (especially if a member of the clergy) will conduct worship and oversee ordinations and installations of ministers as a \"liturgical\" bishop, and other ordinances which are seen as acts of the presbytery.\nThe stated or principal clerk takes minutes and deals with the correspondence of the presbytery, and is often appointed for an indefinite term. Presbytery Clerks are the ecclesiastical administrators and generally regarded as substantially influential due to their greater experience of the governance of the church and their ordering of the business of the presbytery. They are thus very much more than secretaries and often in fact are the lynch pin of the organisation.\nPresbyteries meet at a regularity between monthly and quarterly, some half-yearly.\nSynod.\nIn denominations too large for all the work of the denomination to be done by a single presbytery, the parishes may be divided into several presbyteries under \"synods\" and \"general assemblies\", the synod being the lower court of the two. In the United Church of Canada, this is referred to as \"conferences\" and \"General Council\". However, the United Church of Canada does not bear the formal ecclesiastical structure of classic Presbyterianism.\nOften all members of the constituent presbyteries are members of the synod. Like the commissioners to presbyteries, the commissioners to synods do not act on instruction from their congregations or presbyteries, but exercise their own judgement. A synod also has a moderator and clerk, and generally meet less often than the presbytery.\nSome presbyterian churches, like the Church of Scotland, Orthodox Presbyterian Church and Presbyterian Church in America have no intermediate court between the presbytery and the general assembly.\nGeneral assembly.\nThe \"general assembly\" (or general synod) is the highest court of presbyterian polity. Each presbytery selects a number of its members to be commissioners to the general assembly. The general assembly is chaired by its own moderator, who is usually elected to a single term. He or she is addressed as moderator during meetings, but like the other moderators, their position has no bearing outside of the assembly meeting and affords him/her no special place in other courts. He or she presides over meetings of the assembly, and may be called on in a representative function for the remainder of the year.\nThe stated clerk and deputy clerk of the general assembly administer the minutes, correspondence, and business of the assembly. In some cases a separate business convenor is appointed to deal with the agenda. General assemblies meet less regularly than their subordinate courts, often annually, or in the case of the Presbyterian Church (USA), every other year.\nThe General Assembly also has members serve as Advisory Delegates. There are four different types of advisory delegates, each with a focus on a different area in the Presbyterian Church like young adult, theological student, missionary and ecumenical. The role of an advisory delegate is to speak about issues or topics that commissioners would usually not worry about or care to speak about during a General Assembly meeting. Advisory Delegates may not present motions or vote in meetings of the General Assembly.\nThe powers of the general assembly are usually wide-ranging. However, they may be limited by some form of external review. For example, the rules of the Church of Scotland include the Barrier Act, which requires that certain major changes to the polity of the church be referred to the presbyteries, before being enacted by the general assembly.\nThere may be issues arising between annual General Assemblies which require urgent attention. In these cases some presbyterian churches have a 'commission of assembly' who will deal with the issue and refer it to the next General Assembly for homologation.\nRegions.\nBritish Isles.\nThe word \"Presbyterianism\", when capitalized, often refers specifically to churches founded on principles of presbyterian polity in the British Isles and their derivatives in other countries.\nFrance.\nIn France, presbyterianism was represented by the \u00c9glise r\u00e9form\u00e9e de France. There are also Lutherans and Evangelicals. The logo is a Huguenot Cross (\"Croix huguenote\") with the burning bush.\nItaly.\nThe origins of the Waldensian Evangelical Church lie in the medieval Waldensian movement for religious reform. The Waldensians adopted Calvinist theology during the Reformation and became the Italian branch of the Reformed churches. In 1975 the Waldensian Church joined with the Italian Methodist Church to form the Union of Waldensian and Methodist Churches, which is a member of the World Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, and the World Methodist Council.\nReferences.\nNotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Howard started his career as a child actor before transitioning to directing films. Over his six-decade career, Howard has received multiple accolades, including two Academy Awards, seven Emmy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, and a Grammy Award. He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2003 and was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 2013. He has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions in film and television.\nHoward first came to prominence as a child actor, acting in several television series before gaining national attention for playing young Opie Taylor, the son of Sheriff Andy Taylor (played by Andy Griffith) in the sitcom \"The Andy Griffith Show\" from 1960 through 1968.

He also directed numerous documentaries such as ' (2016), \"Pavarotti\" (2019), and \"We Feed People\" (2022).\nEarly life.\nRon Howard was born on March 1, 1954, in Duncan, Oklahoma, the elder of the two sons of Rance Howard, a director, writer, and actor, and Jean Speegle, an actress. He is of German, English, Scottish, Irish, and Dutch ancestry. His father was born with the surname \"Beckenholdt\" and took the stage name \"Howard\" in 1948 for his acting career. Rance Howard was serving three years in the United States Air Force at the time of Ron's birth.\nHoward was tutored at Desilu Studios in his younger years but continued his schooling at Robert Louis Stevenson Elementary and David Starr Jordan Junior High in Burbank, California, when not working in television, eventually graduating from Burbank's John Burroughs High School. He later attended the University of Southern California's School of Cinematic Arts but did not graduate. Howard has said he knew from a young age he might want to go into directing, thanks to his early experience as an actor.\nActing career.\nIn 1959, Howard had his first credited film role in \"The Journey\". He appeared in June Allyson's CBS anthology series \"The DuPont Show with June Allyson\" in the episode \"Child Lost\"; in \"The Twilight Zone\" episode \"Walking Distance\"; a few episodes of the first season of the sitcom \"Dennis the Menace\", as Stewart, one of Dennis's friends; and several first- and second-season episodes of \"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis\".

Credited as \"Ronny Howard\", he portrayed the son of the main character (played by Andy Griffith) for all eight seasons of the show. Recalling his experiences as a child actor on set, he commented,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I was five years old. And I was preoccupied with the prop that was in my hand, because it was a toy turtle. But I had to pretend it was a real turtle that the audience just wasn't seeing, and it was dead, so I was supposed to be crying and very emotional, and I remember him looking at that little turtle and talking to me about how it was kind of funny to have to pretend that was dead. So I recall just a very relaxed first impression.\nThe sitcom was known for its old-fashioned wholesome quality. Even though it was set in a contemporary time period, it evoked a mood of a different era from that of the 1960s. The series also starred Don Knotts, Frances Bavier and Jim Nabors. It received numerous nominations for the Primetime Emmy Awards including three Outstanding Comedy Series nominations which it lost to \"The Jack Benny Show\" in 1961, \"The Bob Newhart Show\" in 1962, and \"The Monkees\" in 1967.\n\"Happy Days\" (1974\u20131984).\nA role in an installment of series \"Love, American Style\", titled \"Love and the Television Set\", led to his being cast as Richie Cunningham in the TV series \"Happy Days\" (for syndication, the segment was re-titled \"Love and the Happy Days\"). Beginning in 1974, he played the likable \"buttoned-down\" boy, in contrast to Henry Winkler's \"greaser\" Arthur \"Fonzie\"/\"The Fonz\" Fonzarelli. On the \"Happy Days\" set, he developed an on- and off-screen chemistry with Winkler. Howard left \"Happy Days\" to become a film director just before the start of its eighth season in 1980, but returned for guest appearances in the show's eleventh season (1983\u20131984).\nAdditional acting roles.\nIn the 1962 film version of \"The Music Man\", Howard played Winthrop Paroo, the child with the lisp; the film starred Robert Preston, Shirley Jones, and Buddy Hackett.

Howard starred in the film alongside Richard Dreyfus, Charles Martin Smith, and Harrison Ford. Critic Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" praised the film in his four-star review writing, \"\"American Graffiti\" is not only a great movie but a brilliant work of historical fiction; no sociological treatise could duplicate the movie's success in remembering exactly how it was to be alive at that cultural instant.\" Howard reprised his role in the sequel \"More American Graffiti\" (1979).\nIn 1974, Howard guest-starred as Seth Turner, the best friend of Jason Walton (Jon Walmsley), in \"The Waltons\" episode, \"The Gift\".

Practicing evil spells or incantations was proscribed and punishable in early human civilizations in the Middle East. In medieval Europe, witch-hunts often arose in connection to charges of heresy from Catholics and Protestants. An intensive period of witch-hunts occurring in Early Modern Europe and to a smaller extent Colonial America, took place from about 1450 to 1750, spanning the upheavals of the Counter Reformation and the Thirty Years' War, resulting in an estimated 35,000 to 60,000 executions. The last executions of people convicted as witches in Europe took place in the 18th century. In other regions, like Africa and Asia, contemporary witch-hunts have been reported from sub-Saharan Africa and Papua New Guinea, and official legislation against witchcraft is still found in Saudi Arabia, Cameroon and South Africa today.\nIn contemporary English, \"witch-hunt\" metaphorically means an investigation that is usually conducted with much publicity, supposedly to uncover subversive activity, disloyalty, and so on, but with the real purpose of harming opponents. It can also involve elements of moral panic, as well as mass hysteria.\nAnthropological causes.\nThe wide distribution of the practice of witch hunts in geographically and culturally separated societies (Europe, Africa, New Guinea) since the 1960s has triggered interest in the anthropological background of this behaviour. The belief in magic and divination, and attempts to use magic to influence personal well-being (to increase life, win love, etc.) are universal across human cultures.\nBelief in witchcraft has been shown to have similarities in societies throughout the world. It presents a framework to explain the occurrence of otherwise random misfortunes such as sickness or death, and the witch sorcerer provides an image of evil. Reports on indigenous practices in the Americas, Asia and Africa collected during the early modern Age of Exploration have been taken to suggest that not just the belief in witchcraft but also the periodic outbreak of witch-hunts are a human cultural universal.\nOne study finds that witchcraft beliefs are associated with antisocial attitudes: lower levels of trust, charitable giving and group participation. Another study finds that income shocks (caused by extreme rainfall) lead to a large increase in the murder of \"witches\" in Tanzania.\nSilvia Federici posits this expanding violence against women as stemming from dispossession of land and female autonomy. A clear separation from mystical mythologies. She names it as both as a historical phenomenon, as well as one that continues today as capitalism and privatization spreads into the global south.\nHistory.\nAncient Near East.\nPunishment for malevolent magic is addressed in the earliest law codes which were preserved, in both ancient Egypt and Babylonia, where it played a conspicuous part. The Code of Hammurabi (18th\u00a0century\u00a0BC short chronology) prescribes that\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;\nThe Hebrew Bible condemns sorcery. Deuteronomy\u00a018:10\u201312 states: \"No one shall be found among you who makes a son or daughter pass through fire, who practices divination, or is a soothsayer, or an augur, or a sorcerer, or one that casts spells, or who consults ghosts or spirits, or who seeks oracles from the dead. For whoever does these things is abhorrent to the Lord\"; and Exodus\u00a022:18 prescribes: \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\". Tales like that of 1\u00a0Samuel 28, reporting how Saul \"hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land\", suggest that in practice sorcery could at least lead to exile, and the Hebrew verb , translated in the King James Version as \"cut off\", can also be translated as \"kill wholesale\" or \"exterminate\"..\nIn the Judaean Second Temple period, Rabbi Simeon ben Shetach in the 1st century BC is reported to have sentenced to death eighty women who had been charged with witchcraft on a single day in Ascalon. Later the women's relatives took revenge by bringing false witnesses against Simeon's son and causing him to be executed in turn.\nAncient Greco-Roman world.\nNo laws concerning magic survive from Classical Athens. However, cases concerning the harmful effects of \"pharmaka\" \u2013 an ambiguous term that might mean \"poison\", \"medicine\", or \"magical drug\" \u2013 do survive, especially those where the drug caused injury or death. Antiphon's speech \"Against the Stepmother for Poisoning\" tells of the case of a woman accused of plotting to murder her husband with a \"pharmakon\"; a slave had previously been executed for the crime, but the son of the victim claimed that the death had been arranged by his stepmother. The most detailed account of a trial for witchcraft in Classical Greece is the story of Theoris of Lemnos, who was executed along with her children some time before 338\u00a0BC, supposedly for casting incantations and using harmful drugs.\nDuring the pagan era of ancient Rome, there were laws against harmful magic. According to Pliny, the 5th century BC laws of the Twelve Tables laid down penalties for uttering harmful incantations and for stealing the fruitfulness of someone else's crops by magic. The only recorded trial involving this law was that of Gaius Furius Cresimus.\nThe Classical Latin word meant both poisoning and causing harm by magic (such as magic potions), although ancient people would not have distinguished between the two. In 331 BC, a deadly epidemic hit Rome and at least 170 women were executed for causing it by \"veneficium\". In 184\u2013180 BC, another epidemic hit Italy, and about 5,000 people were brought to trial and executed for \"veneficium\". If the reports are accurate, writes Hutton, \"then the Republican Romans hunted witches on a scale unknown anywhere else in the ancient world\".\nUnder the \"Lex Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis\" of 81 BC, killing by \"veneficium\" carried the death penalty. This law banned the trading and possession of harmful drugs and poisons, possession of magical books and other occult paraphernalia. Emperor Augustus strengthened laws to curb these practices, for instance in 31\u00a0BC, by burning over 2,000\u00a0magical books in Rome, except for certain portions of the hallowed Sibylline Books. While Tiberius Claudius was emperor, 85\u00a0women and 45\u00a0men accused of sorcery were executed. By the 3rd century AD, the \"Lex Cornelia\" had begun to be used more broadly against other kinds of magic deemed harmful. The magicians were to be burnt at the stake.\nPersecution of witches continued in the Roman Empire until the late 4th\u00a0century AD and abated only after the introduction of Christianity as the Roman state religion in the 390s.\nMiddle Ages.\nChristianisation in the Early Middle Ages.\nThe German author Wilhelm Gottlieb Soldan argued in \"History of the Witchcraft Trials\" that the philosopher and mathematician Hypatia, murdered by a mob in 415 AD for threatening the influence of Cyril of Alexandria, may have been, in effect, the first famous \"witch\" to be punished by Christian authorities. Cyril's alleged role in her murder, however, was already controversial among contemporary sources, and the surviving primary account by Socrates Scholasticus makes no mention of religious motivations.\nThe 6th\u00a0century AD \"Getica\" of Jordanes records a persecution and expulsion of witches among the Goths in a mythical account of the origin of the Huns. The ancient fabled King Filimer is said to have\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;found among his people certain witches, whom he called in his native tongue \"Haliurunnae\". Suspecting these women, he expelled them from the midst of his race and compelled them to wander in solitary exile afar from his army. There the unclean spirits, who beheld them as they wandered through the wilderness, bestowed their embraces upon them and begat this savage race, which dwelt at first in the swamps, a stunted, foul and puny tribe, scarcely human, and having no language save one which bore but slight resemblance to human speech.\nThe Councils of Elvira (306\u00a0AD), Ancyra (314\u00a0AD), and Trullo (692\u00a0AD) imposed certain ecclesiastical penances for devil-worship. This mild approach represented the view of the Church for many centuries. The general desire of the Catholic Church's clergy to check fanaticism about witchcraft and necromancy is shown in the decrees of the Council of Paderborn, which, in 785\u00a0AD, explicitly outlawed condemning people as witches and condemned to death anyone who burnt a witch. The Lombard code of 643\u00a0AD states:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Let nobody presume to kill a foreign serving maid or female servant as a witch, for it is not possible, nor ought to be believed by Christian minds.\nThis conforms to the teachings of the Canon Episcopi of circa 900\u00a0AD (alleged to date from 314\u00a0AD), which, stated that witchcraft did not exist and that to teach that it was a reality was, itself, false and heterodox teaching. Other examples include an Irish synod in 800\u00a0AD, and a sermon by Agobard of Lyon (810\u00a0AD).\nKing K\u00e1lm\u00e1n (Coloman) of Hungary, in Decree 57 of his First Legislative Book (published in 1100), banned witch-hunting because he said, \"witches do not exist\". The \"Decretum\" of Burchard, Bishop of Worms (about 1020), and especially its 19th book, often known separately as the \"Corrector\", is another work of great importance. Burchard was writing against the superstitious belief in magical potions, for instance, that may produce impotence or abortion. These were also condemned by several Church Fathers. But he altogether rejected the possibility of many of the alleged powers with which witches were popularly credited. Such, for example, were nocturnal riding through the air, the changing of a person's disposition from love to hate, the control of thunder, rain, and sunshine, the transformation of a man into an animal, the intercourse of incubi and succubi with human beings, and other such superstitions. Not only the attempt to practice such things, but the very belief in their possibility, is treated by Burchard as false and superstitious.\nPope Gregory VII, in 1080, wrote to King Harald III of Denmark forbidding witches to be put to death upon being suspected of having caused storms or failure of crops or pestilence. There were many such efforts to prevent unjust treatment of innocent people. On many occasions, ecclesiastics who spoke with authority did their best to disabuse the people of their superstitious belief in witchcraft. A comparable situation in Russia is suggested in a sermon by Serapion of Vladimir (written in 1274~1275), where the popular superstition of witches causing crop failures is denounced.\nCondemnations of witchcraft are nevertheless found in the writings of Augustine of Hippo and early theologians, who made little distinction between witchcraft and the practices of pagan religions. Many believed witchcraft did not exist in a philosophical sense: Witchcraft was based on illusions and powers of evil, which Augustine likened to darkness, a non-entity representing the absence of light. Augustine and his adherents like Saint Thomas Aquinas nevertheless promulgated elaborate demonologies, including the belief that humans could enter pacts with demons, which became the basis of future witch hunts. Ironically, many clerics of the Middle Ages openly or covertly practiced goetia, believing that as Christ granted his disciples power to command demons, to summon and control demons was not, therefore, a sin.\nWhatever the position of individual clerics, witch-hunting seems to have persisted as a cultural phenomenon. Throughout the early medieval period, notable rulers prohibited both witchcraft and pagan religions, often on pain of death. Under Charlemagne, for example, Christians who practiced witchcraft were enslaved by the Church, while those who worshiped the Devil (Germanic gods) were killed outright. Witch-hunting also appears in period literature. According to Snorri Sturluson, King Olaf Trygvasson furthered the Christian conversion of Norway by luring pagan magicians to his hall under false pretenses, barring the doors and burning them alive. Some who escaped were later captured and drowned.\nEarly secular laws against witchcraft include those promulgated by King Athelstan (924\u2013939):\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;And we have ordained respecting witch-crafts, and \"lybacs\" \"[read \"lyblac\" \"sorcery\"]\", and \"morthdaeds [\"murder, mortal sin\"]\": if any one should be thereby killed, and he could not deny it, that he be liable in his life. But if he will deny it, and at threefold ordeal shall be guilty; that he be 120\u00a0days in prison: and after that let kindred take him out, and give to the king 120\u00a0shillings, and pay the wer to his kindred, and enter into borh for him, that he evermore desist from the like.\nIn some prosecutions for witchcraft, torture (permitted by the Roman civil law) apparently took place. However, Pope Nicholas I (866\u00a0AD), prohibited the use of torture altogether, and a similar decree may be found in the Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals.\nLater Middle Ages.\nThe manuals of the Roman Catholic Inquisition remained highly skeptical of witch accusations, although there was sometimes an overlap between accusations of heresy and of witchcraft, particularly when, in the 13th century, the newly formed Inquisition was commissioned to deal with the Cathars of Southern France, whose teachings were charged with including witchcraft and magic. Although it has been proposed that the witch-hunt developed in Europe from the early 14th\u00a0century, after the Cathars and the Knights Templar were suppressed, this hypothesis has been rejected independently by virtually all academic historians (Cohn 1975; Kieckhefer 1976).\nIn 1258, Pope Alexander IV declared that Inquisition would not deal with cases of witchcraft unless they were related to heresy. Although Pope John XXII had later authorized the Inquisition to prosecute sorcerers in 1320, inquisitorial courts rarely dealt with witchcraft save incidentally when investigating heterodoxy.\nIn the case of the Madonna Oriente, the Inquisition of Milan was not sure what to do with two women who, in 1384, confessed to have participated in the society around Signora Oriente or Diana. Through their confessions, both of them conveyed the traditional folk beliefs of white magic. The women were accused again in 1390, and condemned by the inquisitor. They were eventually executed by the secular arm.\nIn a notorious case in 1425, Hermann II, Count of Celje accused his daughter-in-law Veronika of Desenice of witchcraft \u2013 and, though she was acquitted by the court, he had her murdered by drowning. The accusations of witchcraft are, in this case, considered to have been a pretext for Hermann to get rid of an \"unsuitable match,\" Veronika being born into the lower nobility and thus \"unworthy\" of his son.\nA Catholic figure who preached against witchcraft was popular Franciscan preacher Bernardino of Siena (1380\u20131444). Bernardino's sermons reveal both a phenomenon of superstitious practices and an over-reaction against them by the common people. However, it is clear that Bernardino had in mind not merely the use of spells and enchantments and such like fooleries but much more serious crimes, chiefly murder and infanticide. This is clear from his much-quoted sermon of 1427, in which he says:\nOne of them told and confessed, without any pressure, that she had killed thirty children by bleeding them ... [and] she confessed more, saying she had killed her own son ... Answer me: does it really seem to you that someone who has killed twenty or thirty little children in such a way has done so well that when finally they are accused before the Signoria you should go to their aid and beg mercy for them?\nPerhaps the most notorious witch trial in history was the trial of Joan of Arc. Although the trial was politically motivated, and the verdict later overturned, the position of Joan as a woman and an accused witch became significant factors in her execution. Joan's punishment of being burned alive (victims were usually strangled before burning) was reserved solely for witches and heretics, the implication being that a burned body could not be resurrected on Judgment Day.\nTransition to the early modern witch-hunts.\nThe resurgence of witch-hunts at the end of the medieval period, taking place with at least partial support or at least tolerance on the part of the Church, was accompanied with a number of developments in Christian doctrine, for example, the recognition of the existence of witchcraft as a form of Satanic influence and its classification as a heresy. As Renaissance occultism gained traction among the educated classes, the belief in witchcraft, which in the medieval period had been part of the folk religion of the uneducated rural population at best, was incorporated into an increasingly comprehensive theology of Satan as the ultimate source of all \"maleficium\". These doctrinal shifts were completed in the mid-15th century, specifically in the wake of the Council of Basel and centered on the Duchy of Savoy in the western Alps, leading to an early series of witch trials by both secular and ecclesiastical courts in the second half of the 15th century.\nIn 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued \"Summis desiderantes affectibus\", a Papal bull authorizing the \"correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising\" of devil-worshippers who have \"slain infants\", among other crimes. He did so at the request of inquisitor Heinrich Kramer, who had been refused permission by the local bishops in Germany to investigate. However, historians such as Ludwig von Pastor insist that the bull neither allowed anything new, nor was necessarily binding on Catholic consciences. Three years later in 1487, Kramer published the notorious \"Malleus Maleficarum\" (lit., 'Hammer against the Evildoers') which, because of the newly invented printing presses, enjoyed a wide readership. It was reprinted in 14 editions by 1520 and became unduly influential in the secular courts.\nIn Europe, the witch-hunt craze was negligible in Spain, Poland, and Eastern Europe; conversely, it was intense in Germany, Switzerland, and France.\nEarly Modern Europe and Colonial America.\nThe witch trials in Early Modern Europe came in waves and then subsided. There were trials in the 15th and early 16th\u00a0centuries, but then the witch scare went into decline, before becoming a major issue again and peaking in the 17th\u00a0century, particularly during the Thirty Years' War. What had previously been a belief that some people possessed supernatural abilities (which were sometimes used to protect the people), now became a sign of a pact between the people with supernatural abilities and the devil. To justify the killings, some Christians of the time and their proxy secular institutions deemed witchcraft as being associated to wild Satanic ritual parties in which there was naked dancing and cannibalistic infanticide. It was also seen as heresy for going against the first of the Ten Commandments (\"You shall have no other gods before me\") or as violating majesty, in this case referring to the divine majesty, not the worldly. Further scripture was also frequently cited, especially the Exodus decree that \"thou shalt not suffer a witch to live\" (Exodus\u00a022:18), which many supported.\nWitch-hunts were seen across early modern Europe, but the most significant area of witch-hunting in modern Europe is often considered to be central and southern Germany. Germany was a late starter in terms of the numbers of trials, compared to other regions of Europe. Witch-hunts first appeared in large numbers in southern France and Switzerland during the 14th and 15th centuries. The peak years of witch-hunts in southwest Germany were from 1561 to 1670. The first major persecution in Europe, when witches were caught, tried, convicted, and burned in the imperial lordship of Wiesensteig in southwestern Germany, is recorded in 1563 in a pamphlet called \"True and Horrifying Deeds of 63\u00a0Witches\". Witchcraft persecution spread to all areas of Europe. Learned European ideas about witchcraft and demonological ideas, strongly influenced the hunt for witches in the North. These witch-hunts were at least partly driven by economic factors since a significant relationship between economic pressure and witch hunting activity can be found for regions such as Bavaria and Scotland.\nIn Denmark, the burning of witches increased following the reformation of 1536. Christian IV of Denmark, in particular, encouraged this practice, and hundreds of people were convicted of witchcraft and burnt. In the district of Finnmark, northern Norway, severe witchcraft trials took place during the period 1600\u20131692. A memorial of international format, \"Steilneset Memorial\", has been built to commemorate the victims of the Finnmark witchcraft trials. In England, the Witchcraft Act 1541 regulated the penalties for witchcraft. In the North Berwick witch trials in Scotland, over 70\u00a0people were accused of witchcraft on account of bad weather when James VI of Scotland, who shared the Danish king's interest in witch trials, sailed to Denmark in 1590 to meet his betrothed Anne of Denmark. According to a widely circulated pamphlet, \"Newes from Scotland,\" James\u00a0VI personally presided over the torture and execution of Doctor Fian. Indeed, James published a witch-hunting manual, \"Daemonologie\", which contains the famous dictum: \"Experience daily proves how loath they are to confess without torture.\" Later, the Pendle witch trials of 1612 joined the ranks of the most famous witch trials in English history.\nIn England, witch-hunting would reach its apex in 1644 to 1647 due to the efforts of Puritan Matthew Hopkins. Although operating without an official Parliament commission, Hopkins (calling himself Witchfinder General) and his accomplices charged hefty fees to towns during the English Civil War. Hopkins' witch-hunting spree was brief but significant: 300\u00a0convictions and deaths are attributed to his work. Hopkins wrote a book on his methods, describing his fortuitous beginnings as a witch-hunter, the methods used to extract confessions, and the tests he employed to test the accused: stripping them naked to find the Witches' mark, the \"swimming\" test, and pricking the skin. The swimming test, which included throwing a witch, who was strapped to a chair, into a bucket of water to see if she floated, was discontinued in 1645 due to a legal challenge. The 1647 book, \"The Discovery of Witches\", soon became an influential legal text. The book was used in the American colonies as early as May 1647, when Margaret Jones was executed for witchcraft in Massachusetts, the first of 17\u00a0people executed for witchcraft in the Colonies from 1647 to 1663.\nWitch-hunts began to occur in North America while Hopkins was hunting witches in England. In 1645, forty-six years before the notorious Salem witch trials, Springfield, Massachusetts experienced America's first accusations of witchcraft when husband and wife Hugh and Mary Parsons accused each other of witchcraft. In America's first witch trial, Hugh was found innocent, while Mary was acquitted of witchcraft but she was still sentenced to be hanged as punishment for the death of her child. She died in prison. About eighty people throughout England's Massachusetts Bay Colony were accused of practicing witchcraft; thirteen women and two men were executed in a witch-hunt that occurred throughout New England and lasted from 1645 to 1663. The Salem witch trials followed in 1692\u20131693.\nCurrent scholarly estimates of the number of people who were executed for witchcraft vary from about 35,000 to 60,000. The total number of witch trials in Europe which are known to have ended in executions is around 12,000. Prominent contemporaneous critics of witch-hunts included Gianfrancesco Ponzinibio (fl. 1520), Johannes Wier (1515\u20131588), Reginald Scot (1538\u20131599), Cornelius Loos (1546\u20131595), Anton Praetorius (1560\u20131613), Alonso Salazar y Fr\u00edas (1564\u20131636), Friedrich Spee (1591\u20131635), and Balthasar Bekker (1634\u20131698). Among the largest and most notable of these trials were the Trier witch trials (1581\u20131593), the Fulda witch trials (1603\u20131606), the W\u00fcrzburg witch trial (1626\u20131631) and the Bamberg witch trials (1626\u20131631).\nIn addition to known witch trials, witch hunts were often conducted by vigilantes, who may or may not have executed their victims. In Scotland, for example, cattle murrains were blamed on witches, usually peasant women, who were then punished. A popular method called \"scoring above the breath\" meant slashing across a woman's forehead in order to remove the power of her magic. This was seen as a kind of emergency procedure which could be performed in absence of judicial authorities.\nAnother important element of the persecution of witches were denunciations. \"In England, most of the accusers and those making written complaints against witches were women.\" Informers did not have to be revealed to the accused, which was important for the success of the witch trials. In practice, appeals were made to other witnesses to the crimes, so that the first informer was followed by others. In the event of a conviction, the informer sometimes received a third of the accused's assets, but at least 2 guilders. A well-known and well-documented example is the case of Katharina Kepler, the mother of the astronomer Johannes Kepler, for being in a pact with the devil and using witchcraft. In 1615, she was called a witch by a female neighbor in the duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg following a dispute with her of having given her a bitter drink that had made her ill. She was held captive for over a year and threatened with torture, but was finally acquitted thanks to her son's efforts.\nExecution statistics.\nModern scholarly estimates place the total number of executions for witchcraft in the 300-year period of European witch-hunts in the five digits, mostly at roughly between 35,000 and 60,000 (see table below for details), The majority of those accused were from the lower economic classes in European society, although in rarer cases high-ranking individuals were accused as well. On the basis of this evidence, Scarre and Callow asserted that the \"typical witch was the wife or widow of an agricultural labourer or small tenant farmer, and she was well known for a quarrelsome and aggressive nature.\"\nAccording to Julian Goodare, in Europe overall, 80% of those who were persecuted as witches were women, although there were countries and regions like Estonia, Normandy and Iceland, that targeted men more. In Iceland 92% of the accused were men, in Estonia 60%, and in Moscow two-thirds of those accused were male. In Finland, a total of more than 100 death row inmates were roughly equal in both men and women, but all \u00c5landers sentenced to witchcraft were only women.\nAt one point during the W\u00fcrzburg trials of 1629, children made up 60% of those accused, although this had declined to 17% by the end of the year. Rapley (1998) claims that \"75 to 80 percent\" of a total of \"40,000 to 50,000\" victims were women. The claim that \"millions of witches\" (often: \"nine million witches\") were killed in Europe is spurious, even though it is occasionally found in popular literature, and it is ultimately due to a 1791 pamphlet by Gottfried Christian Voigt.\nEnd of European witch-hunts in the 18th century.\nIn England and Scotland between 1542 and 1735, a series of Witchcraft Acts enshrined into law the punishment (often with death, sometimes with incarceration) of individuals practising or claiming to practice witchcraft and magic. The last executions for witchcraft in England had taken place in 1682, when Temperance Lloyd, Mary Trembles, and Susanna Edwards were executed at Exeter. In 1711, Joseph Addison published an article in the highly respected \"The Spectator\" journal (No. 117) criticizing the irrationality and social injustice in treating elderly and feeble women (dubbed \"Moll White\") as witches. Jane Wenham was among the last subjects of a typical witch trial in England in 1712, but was pardoned after her conviction and set free. Janet Horne was executed for witchcraft in Scotland in 1727. The final act, the Witchcraft Act 1735, led to prosecution for fraud rather than witchcraft since it was no longer believed that the individuals had actual supernatural powers or traffic with Satan. The 1735 act continued to be used until the 1940s to prosecute individuals such as spiritualists and gypsies. The act was finally repealed in 1951.\nThe last execution of a witch in the Dutch Republic was probably in 1613. In Denmark, this took place in 1693 with the execution of Anna Palles and in Norway the last witch execution was of Johanne Nilsdatter in 1695, and in Sweden Anna Eriksdotter in 1704. In other parts of Europe, the practice died down later. In France the last person to be executed for witchcraft was Louis Debaraz in 1745. \nIn Croatia the last person condemned for witchcraft to the death penalty was Magda Logomer in 1758. She was acquitted by Maria Theresa in 1758, putting an end to the witch trials in Croatia.\nIn Germany the last death sentence was that of Anna Schwegelin in Kempten in 1775 (although not carried out). \nThe last known official witch-trial was the Doruch\u00f3w witch trial in Poland in 1783. The result of the trial is questioned by Prof. Janusz Tazbir in his book. No reliable sources had been found confirming any executions after the trial. In 1793, two unnamed women were executed in proceedings of dubious legitimacy in Pozna\u0144, Poland.\nAnna G\u00f6ldi was executed in Glarus, Switzerland in 1782 and Barbara Zdunk in Prussia in 1811. Both women have been identified as the last women executed for witchcraft in Europe, but in both cases, the official verdict did not mention witchcraft, as this had ceased to be recognized as a criminal offense.\nIndia.\nThere is no documented evidence of witch-hunting in India before 1792.\nThe earliest evidence of witch-hunts in India can be found in the Santhal Witch Trials in 1792. In the Singhbhum District of the Chota Nagpur Division in Company-ruled India, not only were those accused of being witches murdered, but also those related to the accused to ensure that they would not avenge the deaths (Roy Choudhary 1958: 88). The Chhotanagpur region was majorly populated by an adivasi population called the Santhals. The existence of witches was a belief central to the Santhals. Witches were feared and were supposed to be engaged in anti-social activities. They were also supposed to have the power to kill people by feeding on their entrails, and causing fevers in cattle among other evils. Therefore, according to the adivasi population the cure to their disease and sickness was the elimination of these witches who were seen as the cause.\nThe practice of witch-hunt among Santhals was more brutal than that in Europe. Unlike Europe, where witches were strangulated before being burnt, the santhals forced them \"..to eat human excreta and drink blood before throwing them into the flames.\"\nThe East India Company (EIC) banned the persecution of witches in Gujarat, Rajputana and Chota Nagpur Division in the 1840s\u20131850s. Despite the ban, very few cases were reported as witch-hunting was not seen as a crime. The Santhals believed that the ban in fact allowed the activities of witches to flourish. Thus, the effect of the ban was contrary to what the EIC had intended. During 1857\u201358, there was a surge in witch-hunting; coinciding during the period of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which has led some scholars to see the resurgence of the activity as a form of resistance to Company rule.\nModern cases.\nWitch-hunts still occur today in societies where belief in magic is prevalent. In most cases, these are instances of lynching and burnings, reported with some regularity from much of Sub-Saharan Africa, from Saudi Arabia and from Papua New Guinea. In addition, there are some countries that have legislation against the practice of sorcery. The only country where witchcraft remains legally punishable by death is Saudi Arabia.\nWitch-hunts in modern times are continuously reported by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as a massive violation of human rights. Most of the accused are women and children but can also be elderly people or marginalised groups of the community such as albinos and the HIV-infected. These victims are often considered burdens to the community, and as a result are often driven out, starved to death, or killed violently, sometimes by their own families in acts of social cleansing. The causes of witch-hunts include poverty, epidemics, social crises and lack of education. The leader of the witch-hunt, often a prominent figure in the community or a \"witch doctor\", may also gain economic benefit by charging for an exorcism or by selling body parts of the murdered.\nMiddle East.\nLevant.\nOn 29 and 30\u00a0June 2015, militants of the terrorist group ISIS beheaded two couples on accusations of sorcery and using \"magic for medicine\" in Deir ez-Zor province. Earlier on, the ISIL militants beheaded several \"magicians\" and street illusionists in Syria, Iraq and Libya.\nSaudi Arabia.\nWitchcraft or sorcery remains a criminal offense in Saudi Arabia, although the precise nature of the crime is undefined.\nThe frequency of prosecutions for this in the country as whole is unknown. However, in November\u00a02009, it was reported that 118\u00a0people had been arrested in the province of Makkah that year for practicing magic and \"using the Book of Allah in a derogatory manner\", 74% of them being female. According to Human Rights Watch in 2009, prosecutions for witchcraft and sorcery are proliferating and \"Saudi courts are sanctioning a literal witch hunt by the religious police.\"\nIn 2006, an illiterate Saudi woman, Fawza Falih, was convicted of practising witchcraft, including casting an impotence spell, and sentenced to death by beheading, after allegedly being beaten and forced to fingerprint a false confession that had not been read to her. After an appeal court had cast doubt on the validity of the death sentence because the confession had been retracted, the lower court reaffirmed the same sentence on a different basis.\nIn 2007, Mustafa Ibrahim, an Egyptian national, was executed, having been convicted of using sorcery in an attempt to separate a married couple, as well as of adultery and of desecrating the Quran.\nAlso in 2007, Abdul Hamid Bin Hussain Bin Moustafa al-Fakki, a Sudanese national, was sentenced to death after being convicted of producing a spell that would lead to the reconciliation of a divorced couple.\nIn 2009, Ali Sibat, a Lebanese television presenter who had been arrested whilst on a pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, was sentenced to death for witchcraft arising out of his fortune-telling on an Arab satellite channel. His appeal was accepted by one court, but a second in Medina upheld his death sentence again in March\u00a02010, stating that he deserved it as he had publicly practised sorcery in front of millions of viewers for several years. In November\u00a02010, the Supreme Court refused to ratify the death sentence, stating that there was insufficient evidence that his actions had harmed others.\nOn 12\u00a0December 2011, Amina bint Abdulhalim Nassar was beheaded in Al Jawf Province after being convicted of practicing witchcraft and sorcery. Another very similar situation occurred to Muree bin Ali bin Issa al-Asiri and he was beheaded on 19\u00a0June 2012 in the Najran Province.\nOceania.\nPapua New Guinea.\nThough the practice of \"white\" magic (such as faith healing) is legal in Papua New Guinea, the 1976 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of \"black\" magic, until the Act was repealed in 2013. In 2009, the government reports that extrajudicial torture and murder of alleged witches \u2013 usually lone women \u2013 are spreading from the highland areas to cities as villagers migrate to urban areas. For example, in June\u00a02013, four women were accused of witchcraft because the family \"had a 'permanent house' made of wood, and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing\". All of the women were tortured and Helen Rumbali was beheaded. Helen Hakena, chairwoman of the North Bougainville Human Rights Committee, said that the accusations started because of economic jealousy born of a mining boom.\nReports by U.N. agencies, Amnesty International, Oxfam and anthropologists show that \"attacks on accused sorcerers and witches \u2013 sometimes men, but most commonly women \u2013 are frequent, ferocious and often fatal.\" It's estimated about 150 cases of violence and killings are occurring each year in just the province of Simbu in Papua New Guinea alone. Reports indicate this practice of witch-hunting has in some places evolved into \"something more malignant, sadistic and voyeuristic.\" One woman who was attacked by young men from a nearby village \"had her genitals burned and fused beyond functional repair by the repeated intrusions of red-hot irons.\" Few incidents are ever reported, according to the 2012 Law Reform Commission which concluded that they have increased since the 1980s.\nIndian Subcontinent.\nIndia.\nSome people in India, mostly in villages, have the belief that witchcraft and black magic are effective. On one hand, people may seek advice from witch doctors for health, financial or marital problems. On the other hand, people, especially women, are accused of witchcraft and attacked, occasionally killed. It has been reported that mostly widows or divorcees are targeted to rob them of their property. Reportedly, revered village witch-doctors are paid to brand specific persons as witches (dayan), so that they can be killed without repercussions. The existing laws have been considered ineffective in curbing the murders. In June 2013, National Commission for Women (NCW) reported that according to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics, 768 women had been murdered for allegedly practising witchcraft since 2008 and announced plans for newer laws.\nRecent cases.\nBetween 2001 and 2006, an estimated 300 people were killed in the state of Assam. Between 2005 and 2010, about 35 witchcraft related murders reportedly took place in Odisha's Sundergarh district. In October 2003, three women were branded as witch and humiliated, afterwards they all committed suicide in Kamalpura village in Muzaffarpur district in Bihar. In August 2013, a couple were hacked to death by a group of people in Kokrajhar district in Assam. In September 2013, in the Jashpur district of Chhattisgarh, a woman was murdered and her daughter was raped on the allegation that they were practising black magic.\nA 2010 estimate places the number of women killed as witches in India at between 150 and 200 per year, or a total of 2,500 in the period of 1995 to 2009. The lynchings are particularly common in the poor northern states of Jharkhand, Bihar and the central state of Chhattisgarh.\nWitch hunts are also taking place among the tea garden workers in Jalpaiguri district, West Bengal. The witch hunts in Jalpaiguri are less known, but are motivated by the stress in the tea industry on the lives of the Adivasi (tribal) workers.\nIn India, labeling a woman as a witch is a common ploy to grab land, settle scores or even to punish her for turning down sexual advances. In a majority of the cases, it is difficult for the accused woman to reach out for help and she is forced to either abandon her home and family or driven to commit suicide. Most cases are not documented because it is difficult for poor and illiterate women to travel from isolated regions to file police reports. Less than 2 percent of those accused of witch-hunting are actually convicted, according to a study by the Free Legal Aid Committee, a group that works with victims in the state of Jharkhand.\nNepal.\nWitch-hunts in Nepal are common, and are targeted especially against low-caste women. The main causes of witchcraft-related violence include widespread belief in superstition, lack of education, lack of public awareness, illiteracy, caste system, male domination, and economic dependency of women on men. The victims of this form of violence are often beaten, tortured, publicly humiliated, and murdered. Sometimes, the family members of the accused are also assaulted.\nIn 2010, Sarwa Dev Prasad Ojha, Minister for Women and Social Welfare, said, \"Superstitions are deeply rooted in our society, and the belief in witchcraft is one of the worst forms of this.\"\nSub-Saharan Africa.\nIn many societies of Sub-Saharan Africa, the fear of witches drives periodic witch-hunts during which specialist witch-finders identify suspects, with death by lynching often the result. Countries particularly affected by this phenomenon include South Africa, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Zambia.\nWitch-hunts against children were reported by the BBC in 1999 in the Congo and in Tanzania, where the government responded to attacks on women accused of being witches for having red eyes. A lawsuit was launched in 2001 in Ghana, where witch-hunts are also common, by a woman accused of being a witch. Witch-hunts in Africa are often led by relatives seeking the property of the accused victim.\nAudrey I. Richards, in the journal \"Africa\", relates in 1935 an instance when a new wave of witchfinders, the \"Bamucapi\", appeared in the villages of the Bemba people of Zambia. They dressed in European clothing, and would summon the headman to prepare a ritual meal for the village. When the villagers arrived they would view them all in a mirror, and claimed they could identify witches with this method. These witches would then have to \"yield up his horns\"; i.e. give over the horn containers for curses and evil potions to the witch-finders. The bamucapi then made all drink a potion called \"kucapa\" which would cause a witch to die and swell up if he ever tried such things again.\nThe villagers related that the witch-finders were always right because the witches they found were always the people whom the village had feared all along. The bamucapi utilised a mixture of Christian and native religious traditions to account for their powers and said that God (not specifying which God) helped them to prepare their medicine. In addition, all witches who did not attend the meal to be identified would be called to account later on by their master, who had risen from the dead, and who would force the witches by means of drums to go to the graveyard, where they would die. Richards noted that the bamucapi created the sense of danger in the villages by rounding up \"all\" the horns in the village, whether they were used for anti-witchcraft charms, potions, snuff or were indeed receptacles of black magic.\nThe Bemba people believed misfortunes such as wartings, hauntings and famines to be just actions sanctioned by the High-God Lesa. The only agency which caused unjust harm was a witch, who had enormous powers and was hard to detect. After white rule of Africa, beliefs in sorcery and witchcraft grew, possibly because of the social strain caused by new ideas, customs and laws, and also because the courts no longer allowed witches to be tried.\nAmongst the Bantu tribes of Southern Africa, the witch smellers were responsible for detecting witches. In parts of Southern Africa, several hundred people have been killed in witch-hunts since 1990.\nCameroon has re-established witchcraft-accusations in courts after its independence in 1967.\nIt was reported on 21\u00a0May 2008 that in Kenya a mob had burnt to death at least 11\u00a0people accused of witchcraft.\nIn March 2009, Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000\u00a0people in the Gambia had been abducted by government-sponsored \"witch doctors\" on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to drink poisonous concoctions. On 21\u00a0May 2009, \"The New York Times\" reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambian President, Yahya Jammeh.\nIn Sierra Leone, the witch-hunt is an occasion for a sermon by the \"k\u025bmam\u0254i\" (native Mende witch-finder) on social ethics : \"Witchcraft ... takes hold in people's lives when people are less than fully open-hearted. All wickedness is ultimately because people hate each other or are jealous or suspicious or afraid. These emotions and motivations cause people to act antisocially\". The response by the populace to the \"k\u025bmam\u0254i\" is that \"they valued his work and would learn the lessons he came to teach them, about social responsibility and cooperation.\"\nUse of the term in other contexts.\nThe term 'witch-hunt' can be used in contexts other than witchcraft, to describe an irrational search for alleged offenders who then become the victims of the witch-hunt. Examples include Stalinist witch-hunts and McCarthyite witch-hunts. Researcher James Morone wrote that \"What makes a witch hunt is not the witches (or the communists or the child molesters). Rather, it is the hunters' willingness to toss aside the normal rules of justice.\"\nIn politics, the term may be used to suggest that a person or group is being oppressed or ostracised. \"The Telegraph\" has compared cancel culture to \"modern-day witch trials\". 45th and current U.S. President Donald Trump frequently used the term on\u00a0Twitter, referring to various investigations and the impeachment proceedings against him as witch-hunts. During his presidency he used the phrase over 330 times. The National Rifle Association of America used the term in an unsuccessful bid to dismiss the New York attorney general's lawsuit against the organization for alleged fraud.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Most infections are asymptomatic or have a mild clinical course, but in some outbreaks, the mortality rate approaches 10%. Signs and symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and usually start two to five days after exposure. Symptoms often develop gradually, beginning with a sore throat and fever. In severe cases, a grey or white patch develops in the throat, which can block the airway, and create a barking cough similar to what is observed in croup. The neck may also swell, in part due to the enlargement of the facial lymph nodes. Diphtheria can also involve the skin, eyes, or genitals, and can cause complications, including myocarditis (which in itself can result in an abnormal heart rate), inflammation of nerves (which can result in paralysis), kidney problems, and bleeding problems due to low levels of platelets.\nDiphtheria is usually spread between people by direct contact, through the air, or through contact with contaminated objects. Asymptomatic transmission and chronic infection are also possible. Different strains of \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\" are the main cause in the variability of lethality, as the lethality and symptoms themselves are caused by the exotoxin produced by the bacteria. Diagnosis can often be made based on the appearance of the throat with confirmation by microbiological culture. Previous infection may not protect against reinfection.\nA diphtheria vaccine is effective for prevention, and is available in a number of formulations. Three or four doses, given along with tetanus vaccine and pertussis vaccine, are recommended during childhood. Further doses of the diphtheria\u2013tetanus vaccine are recommended every ten years. Protection can be verified by measuring the antitoxin level in the blood. Diphtheria can be prevented in those exposed, as well as treated with the antibiotics erythromycin or benzylpenicillin. In severe cases a tracheotomy may be needed to open the airway.\nIn 2015, 4,500 cases were officially reported worldwide, down from nearly 100,000 in 1980. About a million cases a year are believed to have occurred before the 1980s. Diphtheria currently occurs most often in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Indonesia. In 2015, it resulted in 2,100 deaths, down from 8,000 deaths in 1990. In areas where it is still common, children are most affected. It is rare in the developed world due to widespread vaccination, but can re-emerge if vaccination rates decrease. In the United States, 57 cases were reported between 1980 and 2004. Death occurs in 5\u201310% of those diagnosed. The disease was first described in the 5th century BC by Hippocrates. The bacterium was identified in 1882 by Edwin Klebs.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe symptoms of diphtheria usually begin two to seven days after infection. They include fever of 38\u00a0\u00b0C (100.4\u00a0\u00b0F) or above; chills; fatigue; bluish skin coloration (cyanosis); sore throat; hoarseness; cough; headache; difficulty swallowing; painful swallowing; difficulty breathing; rapid breathing; foul-smelling and bloodstained nasal discharge; and lymphadenopathy. Within two to three days, diphtheria may destroy healthy tissues in the respiratory system. The dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating, known as a pseudomembrane, that can build up in the throat or nose. It can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils, voice box, and throat, making it very hard to breathe and swallow. Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias, myocarditis, and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies.\nDiphtheritic croup.\nLaryngeal diphtheria can lead to a characteristic swollen neck and throat, or \"bull neck\". The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition, characterized by a brassy or \"barking\" cough, stridor, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing; and historically referred to variously as \"diphtheritic croup\", \"true croup\", or sometimes simply as \"croup\". Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where diphtheria vaccination is customary. As a result, the term \"croup\" nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms.\nTransmission.\nHuman-to-human transmission of diphtheria typically occurs through the air when an infected individual coughs or sneezes. Breathing in particles released from the infected individual leads to infection. Contact with any lesions on the skin can also lead to transmission of diphtheria, but this cause is uncommon. Indirect infections can occur, as well. If an infected individual touches a surface or object, the bacteria can be left behind and remain viable. Also, some evidence indicates diphtheria has the potential to be zoonotic, but this has yet to be confirmed. \"Corynebacterium ulcerans\" has been found in some animals, which would suggest zoonotic potential.\nMechanism.\nDiphtheria toxin (DT) is produced only by \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\" infected with a certain type of bacteriophage. Toxinogenicity is determined by phage conversion (also called lysogenic conversion); i.e., the ability of the bacterium to make DT changes as a consequence of infection by a particular phage. DT is encoded by the \"tox\" gene. Strains of corynephage are either \"tox\"+ (e.g., corynephage \u03b2) or \"tox\"\u2212 (e.g., corynephage \u03b3). The \"tox\" gene becomes integrated into the bacterial genome. The chromosome of \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\" has two different but functionally equivalent bacterial attachment sites (attB) for integration of \u03b2 prophage into the chromosome.\nThe diphtheria toxin precursor is a protein of molecular weight 60\u00a0kDa. Certain proteases, such as trypsin, selectively cleave DT to generate two peptide chains, amino-terminal fragment A (DT-A) and carboxyl-terminal fragment B (DT-B), which are held together by a disulfide bond. DT-B is a recognition subunit that gains entry of DT into the host cell by binding to the EGF-like domain of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor on the cell surface. This signals the cell to internalize the toxin within an endosome via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Inside the endosome, DT is split by a trypsin-like protease into DT-A and DT-B. The acidity of the endosome causes DT-B to create pores in the endosome membrane, thereby catalysing the release of DT-A into the cytoplasm.\nFragment A inhibits the synthesis of new proteins in the affected cell by catalyzing ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor EF-2\u2014a protein that is essential to the translation step of protein synthesis. This ADP-ribosylation involves the transfer of an ADP-ribose from NAD+ to a diphthamide (a modified histidine) residue within the EF-2 protein. Since EF-2 is needed for the moving of tRNA from the A-site to the P-site of the ribosome during protein translation, ADP-ribosylation of EF-2 prevents protein synthesis.\nADP-ribosylation of EF-2 is reversed by giving high doses of nicotinamide (a form of vitamin B3), since this is one of the reaction's end products, and high amounts drive the reaction in the opposite direction.\nDiagnosis.\nThe current clinical case definition of diphtheria used by the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is based on both laboratory and clinical criteria.\nCase classification.\nEmpirical treatment should generally be started in a patient in whom suspicion of diphtheria is high.\nPrevention.\nVaccination against diphtheria is commonly done in infants, and delivered as a combination vaccine, such as a DPT vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus). Pentavalent vaccines, which vaccinate against diphtheria and four other childhood diseases simultaneously, are frequently used in disease prevention programs in developing countries by organizations such as UNICEF.\nTreatment.\nThe disease may remain manageable, but in more severe cases, lymph nodes in the neck may swell, and breathing and swallowing are more difficult. People in this stage should seek immediate medical attention, as obstruction in the throat may require intubation or a tracheotomy. Abnormal cardiac rhythms can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. Diphtheria can also cause paralysis in the eye, neck, throat, or respiratory muscles. Patients with severe cases are put in a hospital intensive care unit, and given diphtheria antitoxin (consisting of antibodies isolated from the serum of horses that have been challenged with diphtheria toxin). Since antitoxin does not neutralize toxin that is already bound to tissues, delaying its administration increases risk of death. Therefore, the decision to administer diphtheria antitoxin is based on clinical diagnosis, and should not await laboratory confirmation.\nAntibiotics have not been demonstrated to affect healing of local infection in diphtheria patients treated with antitoxin. Antibiotics are used in patients or carriers to eradicate \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae,\" and prevent its transmission to others. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends either:\nIn cases that progress beyond a throat infection, diphtheria toxin spreads through the blood, and can lead to potentially life-threatening complications that affect other organs, such as the heart and kidneys. Damage to the heart caused by the toxin affects the heart's ability to pump blood, or the kidneys' ability to clear wastes. It can also cause nerve damage, eventually leading to paralysis. About 40\u201350% of those left untreated can die.\nEpidemiology.\nDiphtheria is fatal in 5\u201310% of cases. In children under five years and adults over 40 years, the fatality rate may be as much as 20%. In 2013, it resulted in 3,300 deaths, down from 8,000 deaths in 1990. Better standards of living, mass immunization, improved diagnosis, prompt treatment, and more effective health care have led to a decrease in cases worldwide.\nHistory.\nIn 1613, Spain experienced an epidemic of diphtheria, referred to as (The Year of Strangulations).\nIn 1705, the Mariana Islands experienced an epidemic of diphtheria and typhus simultaneously, reducing the population to about 5,000 people.\nIn 1735, a diphtheria epidemic swept through New England.\nBefore 1826, diphtheria was known by different names across the world. In England, it was known as \"Boulogne sore throat,\" as the illness had spread from France. In 1826, Pierre Bretonneau gave the disease the name \"diphth\u00e9rite\" (from Greek \u03b4\u03b9\u03c6\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1, \"diphthera\" 'leather'), describing the appearance of pseudomembrane in the throat.\nIn 1856, Victor Fourgeaud described an epidemic of diphtheria in California.\nIn 1878, Princess Alice (Queen Victoria's second daughter) and her family became infected with diphtheria; Princess Alice and her four-year-old daughter, Princess Marie, both died.\nIn 1883, Edwin Klebs identified the bacterium causing diphtheria, and named it Klebs\u2013Loeffler bacterium. The club shape of this bacterium helped Edwin to differentiate it from other bacteria. Over time, it has been called \"Microsporon diphtheriticum\", \"Bacillus diphtheriae\", and \"Mycobacterium diphtheriae\". Current nomenclature is \"Corynebacterium diphtheriae\".\nIn 1884, German bacteriologist Friedrich Loeffler became the first person to cultivate \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\". He used Koch's postulates to prove association between \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\" and diphtheria. He also showed that the bacillus produces an exotoxin.\nIn 1885, Joseph P. O'Dwyer introduced the O'Dwyer tube for laryngeal intubation in patients with an obstructed larynx. It soon replaced tracheostomy as the emergency diphtheric intubation method.\nIn 1888, Emile Roux and Alexandre Yersin showed that a substance (exotoxin) produced by \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\" caused symptoms of diphtheria in animals.\nIn 1890, Shibasabur\u014d Kitasato and Emil von Behring immunized guinea pigs with heat-treated diphtheria toxin. They also immunized goats and horses in the same way, and showed that an \"antitoxin\" made from serum of immunized animals could cure the disease in non-immunized animals. Behring used this antitoxin (now known to consist of antibodies that neutralize the toxin produced by \"C.\u00a0diphtheriae\") for human trials in 1891, but they were unsuccessful. Successful treatment of human patients with horse-derived antitoxin began in 1894, after production and quantification of antitoxin had been optimized. In 1901, Von Behring won the first Nobel Prize in medicine for his work on diphtheria.\nIn 1895, H. K. Mulford Company of Philadelphia started production and testing of diphtheria antitoxin in the United States. Park and Biggs described the method for producing serum from horses for use in diphtheria treatment.\nIn 1897, Paul Ehrlich developed a standardized unit of measure for diphtheria antitoxin. This was the first ever standardization of a biological product, and played an important role in future developmental work on sera and vaccines.\nIn 1901, 10 of 11 inoculated St. Louis children died from contaminated diphtheria antitoxin. The horse from which the antitoxin was derived died of tetanus. This incident, coupled with a tetanus outbreak in Camden, New Jersey, played an important part in initiating federal regulation of biologic products.\nOn 7 January 1904, Ruth Cleveland died of diphtheria at the age of 12 years in Princeton, New Jersey. Ruth was the eldest daughter of former President Grover Cleveland and the former First Lady, Frances Folsom.\nIn 1905, Franklin Royer, from Philadelphia's Municipal Hospital, published a paper urging timely treatment for diphtheria and adequate doses of antitoxin. In 1906, Clemens Pirquet and B\u00e9la Schick described serum sickness in children receiving large quantities of horse-derived antitoxin.\nBetween 1910 and 1911, B\u00e9la Schick developed the Schick test to detect pre-existing immunity to diphtheria in an exposed person. Only those who had not been exposed to diphtheria were vaccinated. A massive, five-year campaign was coordinated by Dr. Schick. As a part of the campaign, 85 million pieces of literature were distributed by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, with an appeal to parents to \"Save your child from diphtheria.\" A vaccine was developed in the next decade, and deaths began declining significantly in 1924.\nIn 1919, in Dallas, Texas, 10 children were killed and 60 others made seriously ill by toxic antitoxin which had passed the tests of the New York State Health Department. The manufacturer of the antitoxin, the Mulford Company of Philadelphia, paid damages in every case.\nDuring the 1920s, an annual estimate of 100,000 to 200,000 diphtheria cases and 13,000 to 15,000 deaths occurred in the United States. Children represented a large majority of these cases and fatalities. One of the most infamous outbreaks of diphtheria occurred in 1925, in Nome, Alaska; the \"Great Race of Mercy\" to deliver diphtheria antitoxin is now celebrated by the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race.\nIn 1926, Alexander Thomas Glenny increased the effectiveness of diphtheria toxoid (a modified version of the toxin used for vaccination) by treating it with aluminum salts. Vaccination with toxoid was not widely used until the early 1930s. In 1939, Dr. Nora Wattie, who was the Principal Medical Officer (Maternity and Child Welfare) of Glasgow between 1934\u2013 1964, introduced immunisation clinics across Glasgow, and promoted mother and child health education, resulting in virtual eradication of the infection in the city.\nWidespread vaccination pushed cases in the United States down from 4.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1932 to 2.0 in 1937. In Nazi Germany, where authorities preferred treatment and isolation over vaccination (until about 1939\u20131941), cases rose over the same period from 6.1 to 9.6 per 100,000 inhabitants.\nBetween June 1942 and February 1943, 714 cases of diphtheria were recorded at Sham Shui Po Barracks in Hong Kong, resulting in 112 deaths because the Imperial Japanese Army did not release supplies of anti-diphtheria serum.\nIn 1943, diphtheria outbreaks accompanied war and disruption in Europe. The 1 million cases in Europe resulted in 50,000 deaths.\nDuring 1948 in Kyoto, 68 of 606 children died after diphtheria immunization due to improper manufacture of aluminum phosphate toxoid.\nIn 1974, the World Health Organization included DPT vaccine in their Expanded Programme on Immunization for developing countries.\nIn 1975, an outbreak of cutaneous diphtheria in Seattle, Washington, was reported.\nAfter the breakup of the former Soviet Union in 1991, vaccination rates in its constituent countries fell so low that an explosion of diphtheria cases occurred. In 1991, 2,000 cases of diphtheria occurred in the USSR. Between 1991 and 1998, as many as 200,000 cases were reported in the Commonwealth of Independent States, and resulted in 5,000 deaths. In 1994, the Russian Federation had 39,703 diphtheria cases. By contrast, in 1990, only 1,211 cases were reported.\nIn early May 2010, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake. The 15-year-old male patient died while workers searched for antitoxin.\nIn 2013, three children died of diphtheria in Hyderabad, India.\nIn early June 2015, a case of diphtheria was diagnosed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain. The six-year-old child who died of the illness had not been previously vaccinated due to parental opposition to vaccination. It was the first case of diphtheria in the country since 1986, as reported by the Spanish daily newspaper \"El Mundo,\" or from 1998, as reported by the WHO.\nIn March 2016, a three-year-old girl died of diphtheria in the University Hospital of Antwerp, Belgium.\nIn June 2016, a three-year-old, five-year-old, and seven-year-old girl died of diphtheria in Kedah, Malacca, and Sabah, Malaysia.\nIn January 2017, more than 300 cases were recorded in Venezuela.\nIn 2017, outbreaks occurred in a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh, and amongst children unvaccinated due to the Yemeni Civil War.\nIn November and December 2017, an outbreak of diphtheria occurred in Indonesia, with more than 600 cases found and 38 fatalities.\nIn November 2019, two cases of diphtheria occurred in the Lothian area of Scotland. Additionally, in November 2019, an unvaccinated 8-year-old boy died of diphtheria in Athens, Greece.\nIn July 2022, two cases of diphtheria occurred in northern New South Wales, Australia.\nIn October 2022, there was an outbreak of diphtheria at the former Manston airfield, a former Ministry of Defence (MoD) site in Kent, England, which had been converted to an asylum seeker processing centre. The capacity of the processing centre was 1,000 people, although about 3,000 were living at the site, with some accommodated in tents. The Home Office, the government department responsible for asylum seekers, refused to confirm the number of cases.\nIn December 2023 there was an outbreak at a school in Luton, in the United Kingdom. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) issued a statement saying specialists have been providing public health support following confirmation of the diphtheria case at a primary school in Luton. The agency said it is working closely with local and national partners \"to ensure all necessary public health measures are implemented\" following the discovery of the new case. The statement added: \"We have conducted a risk assessment and close contacts of the case have been identified and where appropriate, vaccination and advice will be given to prevent the spread of the infection.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Clusters consist of galaxies, heated gas, and dark matter. They are the biggest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe. They were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as galaxy groups rather than clusters of galaxies. Together, galaxy groups and clusters form superclusters.\nBasic properties.\nGalaxy clusters typically have the following properties:\nComposition.\nGalaxy clusters have three main components. Galaxies themselves only make up a small fraction of clusters, although they are the only component we can detect in the visible spectrum. The heated gas of the intracluster medium (ICM) has a peak temperature between 30 and 100 million degrees Celsius. Dark matter makes up the majority of the mass of galaxy clusters, but cannot be detected optically. \nCluster formation and evolution.\nAs galaxy clusters form, massive amounts of energy are released due to shock waves, the heating of gas, and galaxy interactions. Gas collides with existing material which generates shock waves, heating it to tens of millions of degrees and producing X-ray emissions. Galaxy evolution within the cluster is governed by interactions between galaxies, such as galaxy mergers, and gas stripping. \nClassification.\nThere are many classification systems for galaxy clusters, based on characteristics such as shape symmetry, X-ray luminosity, and dominant galaxy type. The Bautz-Morgan classification sorts clusters into types I, II, and III based on the relative brightness of their galaxies\u2013type I with greatest contrast and type III with the least.\nGalaxy clusters as measuring instruments.\nGravitational redshift.\nGalaxy clusters have been used by Radek Wojtak from the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen to test predictions of general relativity: energy loss from light escaping a gravitational field. Photons emitted from the center of a galaxy cluster should lose more energy than photons coming from the edge of the cluster because gravity is stronger in the center. Light emitted from the center of a cluster has a longer wavelength than light coming from the edge. This effect is known as gravitational redshift. Using the data collected from 8000 galaxy clusters, Wojtak was able to study the properties of gravitational redshift for the distribution of galaxies in clusters. He found that the light from the clusters was redshifted in proportion to the distance from the center of the cluster as predicted by general relativity. The result also strongly supports the Lambda-Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, according to which most of the cosmos is made up of Dark Matter that does not interact with matter.\nGravitational lensing.\nGalaxy clusters are also used for their strong gravitational potential as gravitational lenses to boost the reach of telescopes. The gravitational distortion of space-time occurs near massive galaxy clusters and bends the path of photons to create a cosmic magnifying glass. This can be done with photons of any wavelength from the optical to the X-ray band. The latter is more difficult, because galaxy clusters emit a lot of X-rays. However, X-ray emission may still be detected when combining X-ray data to optical data. One particular case is the use of the Phoenix galaxy cluster to observe a dwarf galaxy in its early high energy stages of star formation.\nNotable galaxy clusters.\nNotable galaxy clusters in the relatively nearby universe include the Virgo Cluster, Fornax Cluster, Hercules Cluster, and the Coma Cluster. A very large aggregation of galaxies known as the Great Attractor, dominated by the Norma Cluster, is massive enough to affect the local expansion of the Universe. Notable galaxy clusters in the distant, high-redshift universe include SPT-CL J0546-5345 and SPT-CL J2106-5844, the most massive galaxy clusters found in the early Universe. In the last few decades, they are also found to be relevant sites of particle acceleration, a feature that has been discovered by observing non-thermal diffuse radio emissions, such as radio halos and radio relics. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, structures such as cold fronts and shock waves have also been found in many galaxy clusters.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is printed in tabloid format, and also has an online edition.\nIn October 2009, after being bought by Russian businessman Alexander Lebedev, the paper ended a 180-year history of paid circulation and multiple editions every day, and became a free newspaper publishing a single print edition every weekday, doubling its circulation as part of a change in its business plan.\nOn 29 May 2024, the newspaper announced that it would reduce print publication to once weekly, after nearly 200 years of daily publication, as it had become unprofitable. Daily publication ended on 19 September 2024. The first weekly edition was published on 26 September 2024 under the new name of \"The London Standard\".\nHistory.\nFrom 1827 to 2009.\nThe newspaper was founded by barrister Stanley Lees Giffard on 21 May 1827 as \"The Standard\". The early owner of the paper was Charles Baldwin. Under the ownership of James Johnstone, \"The Standard\" became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. \"The Evening Standard\" was published from 11 June 1859. \"The Standard\" gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the American Civil War (1861\u20131865), the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation. By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.\nBoth \"The Standard\" and the \"Evening Standard\" were acquired by C. Arthur Pearson in 1904. In May 1915, Edward Hulton bought the \"Evening Standard\" from Davison Dalziel. Dalziel had bought both papers in 1910, and closed \"The Standard\", the morning paper, in 1916. Hulton introduced the gossip column \"Londoner's Diary\", originally billed as \"a column written by gentlemen for gentlemen\".\nIn 1923, Lord Beaverbrook, owner of the \"Daily Express\", bought Hulton's newspapers, although he sold them shortly thereafter to the \"Daily Mail\"'s owner Lord Rothermere, with the exception of the \"Standard\". It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by \"The Evening News\", which sold more than 1\u00a0million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip \"Modesty Blaise\", which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. \"The Evening Standard\" ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 November 1974, when it still produced six editions daily. In the 1960s, the paper's political editor Robert Carvel was granted a morning briefing by prime minister Harold Wilson and it had its own correspondents in Paris and Washington.\nIn 1980, Express Newspapers merged the \"Standard\" with Associated Newspapers' \"Evening News\" in a Joint Operating Agreement. The new paper was known as the \"New Standard\" until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into \"The Standard\". In 1987 the \"Evening News\" was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's \"London Daily News\", but was reabsorbed into \"The Standard\" later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper. In 1988 the \"Evening Standard\" included the by-line \"Incorporating the 'Evening News'\", which remained until the paper's sale in 2009.\nLebedev takeover.\nOn 21 January 2009, the Russian businessman and former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev and his son Evgeny Lebedev, who in 2010 went on to own \"The Independent\", agreed to acquire control of the \"Evening Standard\" for \u00a31 for 64 per cent ownership. A few years earlier, 12 per cent of the paper had been sold to Justin Shaw and Geordie Greig. Associated Newspapers retained the remaining 24 per cent.\nMay 2009 relaunch.\nIn May 2009, the newspaper launched a series of poster ads, each of which prominently featured the word \"Sorry\" in the paper's then-masthead font. These ads offered various apologies for past editorial approaches, such as \"Sorry for losing touch\". None of the posters mentioned the \"Evening Standard\" by name, although they featured the paper's Eros logo. Ex-editor Veronica Wadley criticised the \"\"Pravda\"-style\" campaign saying it humiliated the paper's staff and insulted its readers.\nThe campaign was designed by McCann Erickson. Also in May 2009, the paper relaunched as the \"London Evening Standard\" with a new layout and masthead, marking the occasion by giving away 650,000 free copies on the day, and refreshed its sports coverage.\nOctober 2009: freesheet.\nAfter a long history of paid circulation, on 12 October 2009, the \"Standard\" became a free newspaper, with free circulation of 700,000, limited to central London. In February 2010, a paid-for circulation version became available in suburban areas of London for 20p (although many places sell it for 50p). The newspaper won the \"Media Brand of the Year\" and the \"Grand Prix Gold\" awards at the Media Week awards in October 2010. The judges said: \"[\"The Standard\" has] quite simply ... stunned the market. Not just for the act of going free, but because editorial quality has been maintained, circulation has almost trebled and advertisers have responded favourably. Here is a media brand restored to health.\" The \"Standard\" also won the daily newspaper of the year award at the London Press Club Awards in May 2011.\nIn November 2009, it was announced that the \"London Evening Standard\" would drop its morning \"News Extra\" edition from 4 January 2010. From then on, the first edition was the \"West End Final\", available from 2\u00a0pm. One edition of 600,000 copies would be printed starting at 12:30\u00a0pm, ending 5.30\u00a0am starts for journalists and the previous deadline of 7\u00a0am for the first edition. Twenty people were expected to lose their jobs as a result.\nThere were often considerable changes between editions in the front-page lead and the following news pages, including the Londoner's Diary, though features and reviews stayed the same. In January 2010, circulation was increased to 900,000.\nMay 2010: mobile application.\n\"The Evening Standard\" launched a mobile app with US app developer Handmark in May 2010. The range of apps was updated in 2015.\nMarch 2018: redesign.\nIn March 2018, editor George Osborne initiated a redesign of the paper, which included dropping the \"London\" from its title in a signal of the paper's ambition to have greater national and international influence. The paper also introduced more colourful \"signposting\" for different sections such as news, comment, and business, as it was noted by Osborne that it had not been \"easy\" to find them inside the paper previously. The masthead was also redesigned with a new font, and emojis were added to the paper's five-day weather forecast.\nMay 2018: financial sponsorship.\nIn May 2018, James Cusick of \"openDemocracy\" alleged the newspaper had been providing favourable news coverage to companies, including Uber and Google, in exchange for financial sponsorship.\nJune 2019: Job cuts.\nIn June 2019, the \"Evening Standard\" announced job cuts. By the end of 2019, the company reported a pre-tax loss of \u00a313.6 million. In August 2020, the paper announced a further 115 job cuts in order to save the company.\n2024: from daily to weekly, with redundancies.\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic that started in 2020, the \"Evening Standard\"'s daily circulation was about 800,000. By mid-2024, it had dropped below 300,000. The newspaper lost nearly \u00a320 million in 2023.\nOn 29 May 2024, the newspaper announced that it would go from a daily to weekly print publication as it was unprofitable, and become a digital first publication. The newspaper had dropped from about 70 to 30 pages in the preceding decade. The change was made by Lebedev under pressure by Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel, who has owned a 30% stake in the \"Evening Standard\"'s parent company since 2018.\nOn 14 June 2024, the newspaper announced it would eliminate 150 jobs. The redundancies included 70 editorial workers (out of 120), 40 office workers and 45 workers from the paper's printing and distribution operations at Broxbourne. Lebedev proposed to make statutory minimum payments plus \u00a31,000, capped at \u00a321,000, to those made redundant.\nOn 29 July 2024, the last Friday and Monday editions had been printed, and on Thursday 19 September 2024 the last daily format edition was printed. The weekly edition was published on Thursdays from 26 September 2024 under the new name of \"The London Standard\".\nEditorial style.\nFrom July 2020 to October 2021, the newspaper's editor was Emily Sheffield, sister of Samantha Cameron, who took over from the former Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who became editor-in-chief. As editor he had replaced Sarah Sands who, in turn, had replaced Geordie Greig following his departure to \"The Mail on Sunday\" in March 2012. Veronica Wadley was the newspaper's editor between 2002 and 2009. Max Hastings was editor from 1996 until he retired in 2002.\nThe \"Evening Standard\", a regional newspaper, emphasises London-centred news (especially in its features pages), covering building developments, property prices, traffic schemes, politics, the congestion charge and, in the \"Londoner's Diary\" page, gossip on the social scene, and also covers significant national and international news. It also occasionally runs campaigns on London issues that national newspapers do not cover in detail.\nIt has a tradition of providing arts coverage. Its best known former art critic, Brian Sewell, was known for his acerbic view of conceptual art, Britart and the Turner Prize and his views attracted controversy and criticism in the art world. He has been described as \"Britain's most famous and controversial art critic\".\nPolitical stance.\nDuring the 2008 London mayoral election, the newspaper and particularly the correspondent Andrew Gilligan published articles in support of the Conservative candidate Boris Johnson, including frequent front-page headlines condemning Labour opponent Ken Livingstone. This included the headline \"Suicide bomb backer runs Ken's campaign\". On 5 May 2010, the newspaper stated in an editorial that, having supported Labour under Tony Blair, the newspaper would be supporting David Cameron and the Conservatives in the 2010 general election, saying that \"the Conservatives are ready for power: they look like a government in waiting\". On 5 May 2015, an editorial stated that the newspaper would again be supporting Cameron and the Conservatives in the 2015 general election, saying that the Conservatives have \"shown themselves to be good for London\". The newspaper also said \"there may be good tactical reasons to vote Liberal Democrat\".\nThe Media Reform Coalition (MRC) through its chair Justin Schlosberg and Goldsmiths, University of London considered that in the 2016 London mayoral election, the \"Evening Standard\" favoured the Conservative Party. There were almost twice as many positive headlines about the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, as for his Labour rival, Sadiq Khan, with stories exhibiting the strongest bias against Khan also being the most prominent.\nIn the 2017 and 2019 United Kingdom general elections, the \"Evening Standard\" endorsed the Conservative Party. During the 2019 Conservative leadership election, the \"Evening Standard\" endorsed Johnson. During the 2020 Labour leadership election, the \"Evening Standard\" endorsed Keir Starmer to become Labour leader and consequently Leader of the Opposition. The \"Evening Standard\" endorsed Liz Truss in the July\u2013September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. For the 2024 London mayoral election, the \"Evening Standard\" endorsed Khan for Mayor of London. The \"Evening Standard\" later endorsed the Labour Party in the 2024 general election.\nFreesheet and supplements.\nOn 14 December 2004, Associated Newspapers launched a Monday\u2013Friday freesheet edition of the \"Evening Standard\" called \"Standard Lite\" to help boost circulation. This edition had 48 pages, compared with about 80 in the main paper, which also had a supplement on most days.\nIn August 2006, the freesheet was relaunched as \"London Lite\". It was designed to be especially attractive to younger female readers and featured a wide range of lifestyle articles, but less news and business news than the main paper. It was initially available only between 11:30\u00a0a.m. and 2:30\u00a0p.m. at \"Evening Standard\" vendors and in the central area, but later became available in the evening from its street distributors. With the sale of the \"Evening Standard\", but not the \"London Lite\", to Alexander Lebedev on 21 January 2009, the ownership link between the \"Standard\" and the \"Lite\" was broken.\nOn Fridays, the newspaper includes a free glossy lifestyle magazine, \"ES\" (launched as the \"Evening Standard Magazine\" in 2009,) and the circulation was increased to 350,000 in September 2014. This has moved from more general articles to concentrate on glamour, with features on the rich, powerful and famous. On Wednesdays, some areas offer a free copy of the \"Homes &amp; Property\" supplement, edited by Janice Morley, which includes London property listings and articles from lifestyle journalists including Barbara Chandler, Katie Law, and Alison Cork.\nA free entertainment guide supplement \"Metro Life\", previously called \"Hot Tickets\", was published on Thursdays from September 2002 to September 2005. This was a \"what's-on\" guide with listings of cinemas and theatres in and around London.\nEditors.\nEditors, with their year of appointment, have been:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Astronomy, climatology/meteorology, geophysics, oceanography and volcanology are examples of disciplines for which observatories have been constructed.\nThe term \"observatoire\" has been used in French since at least 1976 to denote any institution that compiles and presents data on a particular subject (such as public health observatory) or for a particular geographic area (European Audiovisual Observatory).\nAstronomical observatories.\nAstronomical observatories are mainly divided into four categories according to location: space-based, airborne, ground-based, and underground-based. Historically, ground-based observatories were as simple as containing a mural instrument (for measuring the angle between stars) or Stonehenge (which has some alignments on astronomical phenomena). Astronomical observatories may be private or they may be public.\nGround-based observatories.\nGround-based observatories, located on the surface of Earth, are used to make observations in the radio and visible light portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Most optical telescopes are housed within a dome or similar structure, to protect the delicate instruments from the elements. Telescope domes have a slit or other opening in the roof that can be opened during observing, and closed when the telescope is not in use. In most cases, the entire upper portion of the telescope dome can be rotated to allow the instrument to observe different sections of the night sky. Radio telescopes usually do not have domes.\nFor optical telescopes, most ground-based observatories are located far from major centers of population, to avoid the effects of light pollution. The ideal locations for modern observatories are sites that have dark skies, a large percentage of clear nights per year, dry air, and are at high elevations. At high elevations, the Earth's atmosphere is thinner, thereby minimizing the effects of atmospheric turbulence and resulting in better astronomical \"seeing\". Sites that meet the above criteria for modern observatories include the southwestern United States, Hawaii, Canary Islands, the Andes, and high mountains in Mexico such as Sierra Negra. Major optical observatories include Mauna Kea Observatory and Kitt Peak National Observatory in the US, Roque de los Muchachos Observatory in Spain, and Paranal Observatory and Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.\nSpecific research study performed in 2009 shows that the best possible location for ground-based observatory on Earth is Ridge A\u2014a place in the central part of Eastern Antarctica. This location provides the least atmospheric disturbances and best visibility.\nRadio observatories.\nBeginning in 1933, radio telescopes have been built for use in the field of radio astronomy to observe the Universe in the radio portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Such an instrument, or collection of instruments, with supporting facilities such as control centres, visitor housing, data reduction centers, and/or maintenance facilities are called \"radio observatories\". Radio observatories are similarly located far from major population centers to avoid electromagnetic interference (EMI) from radio, TV, radar, and other EMI emitting devices, but unlike optical observatories, radio observatories can be placed in valleys for further EMI shielding. Some of the world's major radio observatories include the Very Large Array in New Mexico, United States, Jodrell Bank in the UK, Arecibo in Puerto Rico, Parkes in New South Wales, Australia, and Chajnantor in Chile. A related discipline is Very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI).\nHighest astronomical observatories.\nSince the mid-20th century, a number of astronomical observatories have been constructed at very high altitudes, above . The largest and most notable of these is the Mauna Kea Observatory, located near the summit of a volcano in Hawai\u02bbi. The Chacaltaya Astrophysical Observatory in Bolivia, at , was the world's highest permanent astronomical observatory from the time of its construction during the 1940s until 2009. It has now been surpassed by the new University of Tokyo Atacama Observatory, an optical-infrared telescope on a remote mountaintop in the Atacama Desert of Chile.\nOldest astronomical observatories.\nThe oldest proto-observatories, in the sense of an observation post for astronomy,\nThe oldest true observatories, in the sense of a specialized research institute, include:\nSpace-based observatories.\nSpace-based observatories are telescopes or other instruments that are located in outer space, many in orbit around the Earth. Space telescopes can be used to observe astronomical objects at wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that cannot penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and are thus impossible to observe using ground-based telescopes. The Earth's atmosphere is opaque to ultraviolet radiation, X-rays, and gamma rays and is partially opaque to infrared radiation so observations in these portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are best carried out from a location above the atmosphere of our planet. Another advantage of space-based telescopes is that, because of their location above the Earth's atmosphere, their images are free from the effects of atmospheric turbulence that plague ground-based observations. As a result, the angular resolution of space telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope is often much smaller than a ground-based telescope with a similar aperture. However, all these advantages do come with a price. Space telescopes are much more expensive to build than ground-based telescopes. Due to their location, space telescopes are also extremely difficult to maintain. The Hubble Space Telescope was able to be serviced by the Space Shuttles while many other space telescopes cannot be serviced.\nAirborne observatories.\nAirborne observatories have the advantage of height over ground installations, putting them above most of the Earth's atmosphere. They also have an advantage over space telescopes: The instruments can be deployed, repaired and updated much more quickly and inexpensively. The Kuiper Airborne Observatory and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy use airplanes to observe in the infrared, which is absorbed by water vapor in the atmosphere. High-altitude balloons for X-ray astronomy have been used in a variety of countries.\nNeutrino observatories.\nExample underground, underwater or under ice neutrino observatories include:\nMeteorological observatories.\nExample meteorological observatories include:\nMarine observatories.\nA marine observatory is a scientific institution whose main task is to make observations in the fields of meteorology, geomagnetism and tides that are important for the navy and civil shipping. An astronomical observatory is usually also attached. Some of these observatories also deal with nautical weather forecasts and storm warnings, astronomical time services, nautical calendars and seismology.\nExample marine observatories include:\nMagnetic observatories.\nA magnetic observatory is a facility which precisely measures the total intensity of Earth's magnetic field for field strength and direction at standard intervals. Geomagnetic observatories are most useful when located away from human activities to avoid disturbances of anthropogenic origin, and the observation data is collected at a fixed location continuously for decades. Magnetic observations are aggregated, processed, quality checked and made public through data centers such as INTERMAGNET.\nThe types of measuring equipment at an observatory may include magnetometers (torsion, declination-inclination fluxgate, proton precession, Overhauser-effect), variometer (3-component vector, total-field scalar), dip circle, inclinometer, earth inductor, theodolite, self-recording magnetograph, magnetic declinometer, azimuth compass. Once a week at the absolute reference point calibration measurements are performed.\nExample magnetic observatories include:\nSeismic observatories.\nExample seismic observation projects and observatories include:\nGravitational wave observatories.\nExample gravitational wave observatories include:\nVolcano observatories.\nA volcano observatory is an institution that conducts the monitoring of a volcano as well as research in order to understand the potential impacts of active volcanism. Among the best known are the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory and the Vesuvius Observatory. Mobile volcano observatories exist with the USGS VDAP (Volcano Disaster Assistance Program), to be deployed on demand. Each volcano observatory has a geographic area of responsibility it is assigned to whereby the observatory is tasked with spreading activity forecasts, analyzing potential volcanic activity threats and cooperating with communities in preparation for volcanic eruption.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

In apocalypse, a supernatural being reveals cosmic mysteries or the future to a human intermediary. The means of mediation include dreams, visions and heavenly journeys, and they typically feature symbolic imagery drawn from the Jewish Bible, cosmological and (pessimistic) historical surveys, the division of time into periods, esoteric numerology, and claims of ecstasy and inspiration. Almost all are written under pseudonyms, claiming as author a venerated hero from previous centuries, as with the Book of Daniel, composed during the 2nd century BCE but bearing the name of the legendary Daniel from the 6th century BCE. \nEschatology (from Greek \"eschatos\", last) concerns expectations of the end of the present age. Thus, apocalyptic eschatology is the application of the apocalyptic world-view to the end of the world, when God will bring judgment to the world and save his followers. An apocalypse will often contain much eschatological material like the epiphany of Paul the Apostle, but need not: the baptism of Jesus in Matthew's gospel, for example, can be considered apocalyptic in that the heavens open for the presence of a divine mediator (the dove representing the spirit of God) and a voice communicates supernatural information, but there is no eschatological element. In popular use \"apocalypse\" often means such a catastrophic end-times event, but in scholarly use the term is restricted to the visionary or revelatory event. \nScholars have identified examples of the genre ranging from the mid-2nd century BCE to the 2nd century CE, and examples are to be found in Persian and Greco-Roman literature as well as Jewish and Christian. The sole clear case in the Jewish Bible (Old Testament) is chapters 7\u201312 of the Book of Daniel, but there are many examples from non-canonical Jewish works; the Book of Revelation is the only apocalypse in the New Testament, but passages reflecting the genre are to be found in the gospels and in nearly all the genuine Pauline epistles.\nDefinition and history.\n\"Apocalypse\" has come to be used popularly as a synonym for catastrophe, but the Greek word \"apok\u00e1lypsis\", from which it is derived, means a revelation. It has been defined by John J Collins as \"a genre of revelatory literature with a narrative framework, in which a revelation is mediated by an otherworldly being to a human recipient, disclosing a transcendent reality which is both temporal, in that it envisages eschatological salvation, and spatial, insofar as it involves another, supernatural world.\" Collins later refined his definition by adding that apocalypse \"is intended to interpret present, earthly circumstances in light of the supernatural world and of the future, and to influence both the understanding and the behaviour of the audience by means of divine authority.\" \nThe genre of Jewish and Christian apocalypse flourished c. 250 BCE\u2013250 CE, but its antecedents can be traced back much further, in the Jewish prophetic and wisdom traditions (e.g., Ezekiel 1\u20133 and Zechariah 1\u20136), and in the mythologies of the Ancient Near East, which have left a legacy of symbology (e.g., the sea as a symbol of chaos in Daniel 7 and Revelation 13:1). Zoroastrian dualism may also have played a role. The reasons for its rise are obscure, but there seems to be a connection to times of crisis, such as the 2nd century BCE persecution of the Jews reflected in Daniel's final vision, or the destruction of the Temple in 70 CE reflected in 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch.\nCharacteristics.\nApocalyptic revelations are typically mediated through such means as dreams and visions (the ancient world did not distinguish between these), angels, and heavenly journeys. These serve to connect two sets of axes, the spatial axis which has God and the heavenly realm above and the human world below, and the temporal axis of the present and the future. The revelation thus demonstrates that God rules the visible world, and that the present days are leading to an end-time in which divine justice will be done and God's rule will become visible. Mythic images with their roots in texts from the Hebrew Bible and rich in symbolic meaning are a significant characteristic of the genre. Further characteristics include transcendentalism, mythology, pessimistic cosmological and historical surveys, dualism (including a doctrine of two ages and the division of time into periods), numerology (e.g., the \"number of the beast\" in Revelation), claims of ecstasy and inspiration, and esotericism. \nWith the exception of the Apocalypse of John the authors of apocalyptic works released their books under pseudonyms (false names): the Book of Daniel, for example, was composed during the 2nd century BCE but took the name of the legendary Daniel for its hero. Pseudonymity may have been used to secure acceptance for the new works, to protect the real authors from reprisals, or because the authors had experienced what they believed to be genuine revelations from the famous past figure or identified with him and claimed to write on his behalf.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58972", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58972", "title": "Friedensreich Hundertwasser", "text": "Austrian-born visual artist (1928\u20132000)\nFriedrich Stowasser (15 December 1928 \u2013 19 February 2000), better known by his pseudonym Friedensreich Regentag Dunkelbunt Hundertwasser (), was an Austrian visual artist and architect who also worked in the field of environmental protection. He emigrated to the Far North of New Zealand in the 1970s, where he lived and worked for most of the rest of his life.\nHundertwasser stood out as an opponent of \"a straight line\" and any standardisation, expressing this concept in the field of building design. His best known work is the Hundertwasserhaus in Vienna, which has become a notable place of interest in the Austrian capital, characterised by imaginative vitality and uniqueness.\nBiography.\nThe Nazi era was a very hard time for Hundertwasser and his mother Elsa, who were Jewish. They avoided persecution by posing as Christians, a credible ruse as Hundertwasser's father had been a Catholic. Hundertwasser was baptized as a Catholic in 1935. To remain inconspicuous, Hundertwasser also joined the Hitler Youth. He has identified himself as \"half-Jewish\".\nHundertwasser developed artistic skills early on. After the war, he spent three months at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. At this time, he began to sign his art as Hundertwasser instead of Stowasser. He left to travel, using a small set of paints he carried at all times to sketch anything that caught his eye. In Florence, he met the young French painter Ren\u00e9 Br\u00f4 for the first time and they became lifelong friends. Hundertwasser's first commercial painting success was in 1952\u201353 with an exhibition in Vienna.\nHis adopted surname is based on the translation of \"sto\" (the Slavic word for \"(one) hundred\") into German. The name \"Friedensreich\" has a double meaning as \"Peace-realm\" or \"Peace-rich\" (in the sense of \"peaceful\"). Therefore, his name \"Friedensreich Hundertwasser\" translates directly into English as \"Peace-Realm Hundred-Water\". The other names he chose for himself, \"Regentag\" and \"Dunkelbunt\", translate to \"Rainy day\" and \"Darkly multi-coloured\".\nIn the early 1950s, he entered the field of architecture. Hundertwasser also worked in the field of applied art, creating flags, stamps, coins, and posters. His most famous flag is his koru flag (designed in 1983), as well as several postage stamps for the Austrian Post Office. He also designed stamps for Cape Verde and for the United Nations postal administration in Geneva on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\nIn 1957 Hundertwasser acquired a farm on the edge of Normandy. Hundertwasser married Herta Leitner in 1958 but they divorced two years later. He married again in 1962 to the Japanese artist Yuko Ikewada but she divorced him in 1966. By this time, he had gained a popular reputation for his art.\nIn 1964 Hundertwasser bought \"Hahns\u00e4ge\", a former saw mill, in the sparsely populated Lower Austria's Waldviertel. There, far from the hustle and bustle and surrounded by nature, he set up a new home.\nHe spent some time in the 1960s in the Tooro Kingdom in Uganda, Central Africa, where he painted a number of works and named them after the kingdom.\nIn 1972 Hundertwasser incorporated a stock company, the \"Gr\u00fcner Janura AG\", in Switzerland; in 2008 it was renamed as \"Namida AG\". Hundertwasser managed his intellectual property rights through this company.\nIn the 1970s, Hundertwasser acquired several properties in the Bay of Islands in the far northern Te Tai Tokerau region of New Zealand, which include a total area of approximately 372\u00a0ha of the entire Kaurinui valley. There he realised his dream of living and working closely connected to nature. Beside other projects he designed the \"Bottle House\" there. He could live largely self-sufficiently using solar panels, a water wheel and a biological water purification plant. His first grass roof experiments took place there.\nIn 1979 Hundertwasser bought the vast historical garden \"Giardino Eden\" ('Garden of Eden') in Venice, including the Palazzo \"Villa delle Rose\", from Alexandra of Yugoslavia via his Swiss company.\nIn 1980, Hundertwasser visited Washington D.C. to support activist Ralph Nader's efforts to oppose nuclear proliferation. Mayor Marion Barry declared 18 November to be Hundertwasser Day as a result. Hundertwasser planted trees in Judiciary Square and advocated on behalf of a co-op apartment owner who was taken to court for installing a bay window.\nIn 1982, Hundertwasser's only child, Heidi Trimmel, was born.\nHe died on 19 February 2000 on board \"Queen Elizabeth 2\" in the Pacific Ocean, from a heart attack. According to his wish he was buried in harmony with nature on his land in New Zealand, in the Garden of the Happy Dead under a tulip tree.\nArtistic style and themes.\nHundertwasser's original and unruly artistic vision expressed itself in pictorial art, environmentalism, philosophy, and design of facades, postage stamps, flags, and clothing (among other areas). The common themes in his work utilised bright colours, organic forms, a reconciliation of humans with nature, and a strong individualism, rejecting straight lines.\nHe remains sui generis, although his architectural work is comparable to Antoni Gaud\u00ed (1852\u20131926) in its use of biomorphic forms and the use of tile. He was also inspired by the art of the Vienna Secession, and by the Austrian painters Egon Schiele (1890\u20131918) and Gustav Klimt (1862\u20131918).\nHe was fascinated by spirals, and called straight lines \"godless and immoral\" and \"something cowardly drawn with a rule, without thought or feeling\" He called his theory of art \"transautomatism\", focusing on the experience of the viewer rather than the artist. This was encapsulated by his design of a new flag for New Zealand, which incorporated the image of the Koru a spiral shape based on the image of a new unfurling silver fern frond and symbolising new life, growth, strength and peace according to the M\u0101ori people.\nArchitecture.\nEven though Hundertwasser first achieved notoriety for his boldly-coloured paintings, he is more widely known for his individual architectural designs. These designs use irregular forms, and incorporate natural features of the landscape. The \"Hundertwasserhaus\" apartment block in Vienna has undulating floors (\"an uneven floor is a melody to the feet\"), a roof covered with earth and grass, and large trees growing from inside the rooms, with limbs extending from windows. He took no payment for the design of \"Hundertwasserhaus\", declaring that it was worth the investment to \"prevent something ugly from going up in its place\".\nFrom the early 1950s he increasingly focused on architecture, advocating more just human and environmental friendly buildings. This began with manifestos, essays and demonstrations. For example, he read out his \"Mouldiness Manifesto against Rationalism in Architecture\" in 1958 on the occasion of an art and architectural event held at the Seckau Monastery. He rejected the straight line and the functional architecture. In Munich in 1967 he gave a lecture called \"Speech in Nude for the Right to a Third Skin\". His lecture \"Loose from Loos, A Law Permitting Individual Buildings Alterations or Architecture-Boycott Manifesto\", was given at the Concordia Press Club in Vienna in 1968.\nIn the Mouldiness Manifesto he first claimed the \"Window Right\": \"A person in a rented apartment must be able to lean out of his window and scrape off the masonry within arm's reach. And he must be allowed to take a long brush and paint everything outside within arm's reach. So that it will be visible from afar to everyone in the street that someone lives there who is different from the imprisoned, enslaved, standardised man who lives next door.\" In his nude speeches of 1967 and 1968 Hundertwasser condemned the enslavement of humans by the sterile grid system of conventional architecture and by the output of mechanised industrial production. He rejected rationalism, the straight line and functional architecture.\nFor Hundertwasser, human misery was a result of the rational, sterile, monotonous architecture, built following the tradition of the Austrian architect Adolf Loos, author of the modernist manifesto \"Ornament and crime\" (1908). He called for a boycott of this type of architecture, and demanded instead creative freedom of building, and the right to create individual structures. In 1972 he published the manifesto \"Your window right \u2014 your tree duty\". Planting trees in an urban environment was to become obligatory: \"If man walks in nature's midst, then he is nature's guest and must learn to behave as a well-brought-up guest.\" Hundertwasser propagated a type of architecture in harmony with nature in his ecological commitment. He campaigned for the preservation of the natural habitat and demanded a life in accordance with the laws of nature. He wrote numerous manifestos, lectured and designed posters in favour of nature protection, including against nuclear power, to save the oceans and the whales and to protect the rainforest. He was also an advocate of composting toilets and the principle of constructed wetland. He perceived feces not as nauseous but as part of the cycle of nature. His beliefs are testified by his manifesto \"The Holy Shit\" and his DIY guide for building a composting toilet.\nIn the 1970s, Hundertwasser had his first architectural models built. The models for the Eurovision TV-show \"W\u00fcnsch Dir was\" (Make a Wish) in 1972 exemplified his ideas on forested roofs, tree tenants and the window right. In these and similar models he developed new architectural shapes, such as the spiral house, the eye-slit house, the terrace house and the high-rise meadow house.\nIn 1974, Peter Manhardt made models for him of the pit-house, the grass roof house and the green service station \u2013 along with his idea of the invisible, inaudible Green Motorway.\nIn the early 1980s Hundertwasser remodelled the Rosenthal Factory in Selb, and the Mierka Grain Silo in Krems. These projects gave him the opportunity to act as what he called an \"architecture doctor\".\nIn architectural projects that followed he implemented window right and tree tenants, uneven floors, woods on the roof, and spontaneous vegetation. Works of this period include: housing complexes in Germany; a church in B\u00e4rnbach, Austria; a district heating plant in Vienna; an incineration plant and sludge centre in Osaka, Japan; a railway station in Uelzen; a winery in Napa Valley; and the Hundertwasser toilet in Kawakawa, New Zealand.\nIn 1993 Hundertwasser was invited to design an arts centre. He completed the design but the project was not completed at that time. The project was finally approved in 2015 and became the Hundertwasser Art Centre, opening to the public in 2022. This became the last authentic Hundertwasser building to be completed.\nIn 1999 Hundertwasser started his last project named (in German). Although he never completed this work, the building was built a few years later in Magdeburg, a town in eastern Germany, and opened on 3 October 2005.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAn art gallery featuring Hundertwasser's work was established in the Hundertwasser Art Centre in Whang\u0101rei, New Zealand, and will brought to fruition his 1993 plans for the building.\nStamps and medals.\nThe extensive work of Hundertwasser includes 26 stamps for various postal administrations. Seventeen of these designs were \u2013 in part after his death \u2013 implemented as postage stamps.\nTwo of the unrealised designs are alternative designs for a stamp issue (United Nations, Senegal) and were therefore not performed. Seven other designs created for the postal administrations of Morocco and French Polynesia were not realised as a postage stamp.\nIn addition, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, has adapted some of his works for stamp issues. On the basis of these adaptations have been stamps issued by:\nThe Austrian post office used more Hundertwasser motives for the European edition 1987 (Modern architecture, Hundertwasser House), on the occasion of his death in 2000 (painting Blue Blues, under the WIPA 2000) and 2004 National Donauauen (poster: \"The outdoors is our freedom\" at civil protests in Hainburg).\nFor the first time a Hundertwasser motive was also used on a Cuban stamp, as part of the art exhibition Salon de Mayo (Havana, 1967).\nWith the exception of service marks for the Council of Europe and the Cuban stamp, all stamps were engraved by Wolfgang Seidel and by the Austrian State Printing Office in a complex combination printing process produces (intaglio printing, rotogravure printing, as well as metal stamping).\nHundertwasser also worked as a medallist.\nPolitical views.\nBeginning in the 1950s Hundertwasser travelled globally promoting ecological causes. In 1959 Hundertwasser got involved with helping the Dalai Lama escape from Tibet by campaigning for the Tibetan religious leader in Carl Laszlo's magazine \"Panderma\". In later years, when he was already a known artist, Friedensreich Hundertwasser became an environmental activist and most recently operated as a more prominent opponent of the European Union, advocating the preservation of regional peculiarities.\nAmong the lesser-known facets of Hundertwasser's personality is his commitment to constitutional monarchy: Austria needs something to look up to, consisting of perennial higher values\u2014of which one now hardly dares to speak\u2014such as beauty, culture, internal and external peace, faith, richness of heart [...] Austria needs an emperor, who is subservient to the people. A superior and radiant figure in whom everyone has confidence, because this great figure is a possession of all. The rationalist way of thinking has brought us, in this century, an ephemeral higher, American standard of living at the expense of nature and creation, which is now coming to an end, for it is destroying our heart, our quality of life, our longing, without which an Austrian does not want to live. It is outrageous that Austria has an emperor who did no evil to anyone but is still treated like a leper. Austria needs a crown! Long live Austria! Long live the constitutional monarchy! Long live Otto von Habsburg!- Friedensreich Hundertwasser, \"F\u00fcr die Wiederkehr der konstitutionellen Monarchie\" (For the Return of the Constitutional Monarchy).Kaurinui, New Zealand, 28 March 1983; dedicated, on 14 May 1987, to Otto von Habsburg for his 75th birthday.\nExhibitions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nCollections.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources"}

Most woodwind instrument reeds are made from \"Arundo donax\" (\"Giant cane\") or synthetic material. Tuned reeds (as in harmonicas and accordions) are made of metal or synthetics. Musical instruments are classified according to the type and number of reeds.\nThe earliest types of single-reed instruments used idioglottal reeds, where the vibrating reed is a tongue cut and shaped on the tube of cane. Much later, single-reed instruments started using heteroglottal reeds, which are cut and separated from the tube of cane and attached to some type of mouthpiece. By contrast, in an uncapped double reed instrument (such as the oboe and bassoon), there is no mouthpiece; the two parts of the reed vibrate against one another.\nSingle reeds.\nSingle reeds are used on the mouthpieces of clarinets and saxophones. They are roughly rectangular, with a tip that is rounded to match the shape of the mouthpiece. The back of the reed is flat to sit flat on the mouthpiece table, and the reed's thickness tapers to a thin tip. All single reeds are shaped similarly but vary in size to fit each instrument's mouthpiece.\nReeds designed for the same instrument look roughly identical, but vary in thickness (\"hardness\" or \"strength\"). Hardness is generally measured on a scale of 1 through 5 from softest to hardest. This is not a standardized scale and reed strengths vary by manufacturer. The thickness of the tip and heel, as well as the profile in between, affect the sound and playability. Pieces of cane that differ in stiffness will respond differently even if cut with the same profile.\nConstruction.\nThe cane used to make reeds for single-reed instruments is grown in the southern coastal regions of France and Spain and, in the last 30 years, in the Cuyo area of Argentina. After the cane is cut it is placed in direct sunlight for about a month to dry. The cane is rotated regularly to ensure even and complete drying. Once dry, the cane is stored in a warehouse. As production requires, cane is taken to a factory's cutting department, where it is cut into tubes graded by diameter and wall thickness. The tubes are cut into \"splits\" and made into reed blanks. Blanks are tapered and profiled into reeds using blades or CNC machines. Completed reeds are graded for strength by machine.\nDouble reeds.\nDouble reeds are used on many instruments, such as the oboe, oboe d'amore, English horn, bass oboe, heckelphone, bassoon, contrabassoon, sarrusophone, shawm, bagpipes, nadaswaram and shehnai and others. The two reeds vibrate against each other and not against a mouthpiece. In the case of the crumhorn, bagpipes, and Rauschpfeife, a reed cap encloses the reeds, and the reeds do not contact the player's mouth.\nManufacturing.\nDouble reed manufacturing begins the same way as that of single reeds. \"Arundo donax\" cane is collected, dried, processed, cut to manageable sizes, and separated into various diameters. The most common diameters for American-style oboe reeds are: , , and . Many American oboists prefer one diameter at one time of the year and a different diameter at other times.\nThe tubes are split into three equal parts and the pieces that are not warped are chosen. A reed made from warped cane will not vibrate consistently on both sides. The split pieces are gouged by machine to remove many layers and drastically decrease thickness, which eases the scraping process for the reed-maker.\nFinally, the gouged pieces of cane are soaked, shaped on a shaper with razor blades, and allowed to dry before the final steps. The shaped piece of cane is then re-soaked and tied onto a \"staple\" for oboe reeds or formed on a mandrel for bassoon reeds. Double reeds are tied in place with thread. Finishing both bassoon and oboe reeds requires the reed-maker to scrape along the cane section of the reed with a scraping knife to specific dimensions and lengths depending on the reed style and the musician's preference. Bassoon and oboe reeds are finished when the reeds play in tune or can make a sufficient \"crow\"-like noise.\nQuadruple reeds.\nQuadruple reed instruments have four reeds, two on top and two on bottom. Examples of this include an archetypal instrument from India, the shehnai, as well as the pi from Thailand, and the Cambodian sralai. Having four reeds instead of two produces a very different tone and set of harmonics.\nFree reeds.\nThere are two types of free reeds: framed and unframed. Framed free reeds are used on ancient East Asian instruments such as the Chinese sh\u0113ng and Japanese sh\u014d, ancient Southeast Asian instruments like the Laotian khene, and modern European instruments such as the harmonium or reed organ (consisting of reed pipes), harmonica, concertina, bandone\u00f3n, accordion, and Russian bayan. The reed is made from cane, willow, brass, or steel, and is enclosed in a rigid frame. The pitch of the framed free reed is fixed.\nThe ancient bullroarer is an unframed free reed made of a stone or wooden board tied to a rope that is swung around through the air to make a whistling sound. Another primitive unframed free-reed instrument is the leaf (the \"bilu\"), used in some traditional Chinese music ensembles. A leaf or long blade of grass is stretched between the sides of the thumbs and tensioned slightly by bending the thumbs to change the pitch. The tone can be modified by cupping the hands to provide a resonant chamber.\nMaterials.\nMost woodwind instrument reeds are made from cane, but there are synthetic reeds for clarinet, saxophone, double reed instruments, and bagpipes. Synthetic reeds are more durable and do not need to be moistened before playing.\nRecently, synthetic reeds have been made from synthetic polymer compounds, and from a combination of cane and synthetics.\nThe dizi, a Chinese transverse flute, has a distinctive kind of reed (a di mo), which is made from a paper-like bamboo membrane.\nCommercial vs. handmade.\nMusicians originally crafted reeds from cane using simple tools, a time-consuming and painstaking process. Specialized tools for cutting and trimming reeds by hand reduce the time needed to finish a reed. Today, nearly all single-reed instrument players buy manufactured reeds, though many adjust them by shaving or sanding. Some professionals make single reeds from blanks, but this is time-consuming and can require expensive equipment. Among double reed players, advanced and professional players typically make their own reeds, while beginners and students often buy reeds, either from their teachers or from commercial sources.\nCare and maintenance.\nThe playing characteristics of cane reeds are susceptible to changes in temperature and humidity.\nManufacturers produce reeds in different strengths, indicated by a number (most commonly 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, and 5). The strength is determined by a machine that presses against the vamp (the part that includes the tip and the \"heart\" just behind the tip) of the reed and determines how stiff the reed is. The machine separates the reeds according to hardness. Individual reeds graded with the same strength/hardness will vary in their playing characteristics. If a reed is too hard, sections of it can be adjusted using blades, scrapers, or abrasives.\n\"Reed players\".\nMusical theatre orchestras call for woodwind players to each play several different instruments from the single-reed, flute, and double-reed families. In this context, these players are commonly referred to as \"reed players\". An individual part may call for only one or two instruments, or many more (the \"Reed 3\" part in Bernstein's \"West Side Story\" calls for piccolo, flute, oboe, English horn, clarinet, bass clarinet, and tenor and baritone saxophones).\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "58989", "revid": "35936988", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58989", "title": "Ancient Domains of Mystery", "text": "1994 roguelike video game\nAncient Domains of Mystery is a roguelike video game designed and developed by Thomas Biskup and released in 1994. The player's goal is to stop the forces of Chaos that invade the world of Ancardia. The game has been identified as one of the \"major roguelikes\" by John Harris.\nLike the original roguelike games, \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" uses ASCII graphics to represent the game world. A later version added the option to play with sound, tile-based graphics, and an overworld map. Most dungeons are procedurally generated, but once the game generates a dungeon, it does not change even if the player exits and re-enters it.\nBiskup ceased development of the game for nine years and revisited it in 2012. He then resumed work on a sequel, \"Ultimate ADOM\", an engine for future roguelike games. Biskup first made an updated version of \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" available to sponsors of his crowdfunding campaign. Later versions, beginning with v1.15.2.r60, were released on the internet and through digital distribution services.\nPlot.\n\"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" takes place in the fictional world of Ancardia, in the mountainous Drakalor Chain. For 6,000 years, the world has known relative peace, but recently reports have spread of the appearance of dangerous dungeons and frightening monsters. Khelavaster, a wise sage, discovers an ancient prophecy regarding the Coming of Chaos and propagates it to the peoples of the world. It speaks of a champion who will defend the world from the forces of Chaos in the Drakalor Chain.\nHearing of this prophecy, many would-be heroes set out. The player assumes control of one such adventurer. \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" has multiple endings which consist of closing the Chaos gate, becoming a demigod, or committing a heroic sacrifice to stop the Chaos invasion.\nGameplay.\n\"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" presents an initial choice of one (male or female) player character from twelve races and twenty-two character classes, the combination of which strongly affects gameplay, in both subtle and obvious ways. Among other traits, character development includes experience levels, statistics, and skills. Version 1.1.0 introduced a talent system, allowing further customization of characters, based on a hierarchical system of prerequisites.\nDuring adventures, a player is likely to explore many areas and complete multiple quests. Which quests are available may depend on character experience level or alignment (lawful, neutral, or chaotic). Alignment also affects NPC and deity interaction with the character. How one solves a quest can also affect one's alignment, such that a chaotic character seeking redemption can eventually become lawful through his or her actions (or vice versa).\n\"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" offers multiple ways of winning, which vary in difficulty. The regular ending that appeared first during development consists of locating and closing the gate through which the forces of Chaos infiltrate Ancardia. The player also has the option to enter the gate, providing access to special endings, which are generally considered more difficult to accomplish. \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\"'s quest-centric, plot-driven structure owes as much to adventure games like \"Zork\" as to the hack-and-slash of sibling games like \"Angband\".\nCorruption.\nThe forces of Chaos that have infiltrated Ancardia corrupt both the surrounding landscape and occasionally the player's character, causing mutations, such as antennae or a tail growing, alteration of existing body features or gaining (often involuntary) magical abilities. Some mutations are helpful, while others make the game much harder; many have elements of both. Players need to be resourceful and adaptable due to the randomness of these mutations. While there are limited opportunities in the game to mitigate or remove corruption effects, taking too long to close the Chaos gate causes the corruption rate to increase dramatically. After becoming fully corrupted, the game ends, as the character has become a \"writhing mass of primal chaos\". The chaotic ending requires the character to be almost fully corrupted.\nBesides background corruption, some powerful chaotic artifacts can cause the character to become corrupted merely by carrying them. Other less powerful chaotic artifacts only corrupt when actively invoked or wielded. Generally, most artifacts and magic items are safe to carry and use, and only the most powerful items affect corruption rates.\nHerbs.\nHerbs growing on some levels can be used to provide great benefits to the player. The growth of the herbs follows a slight modification of Conway's Game of Life. While any character can harvest these herbs to limited effect, characters with certain skills and class abilities have strong bonuses and can even plant their own herb seeds. Besides herbs, characters can also collect plant seeds, either to donate to farmers (for a small alignment shift to law) or plant in dungeons in order to grow trees (useful for making bridges or fletching).\nSmithing.\nPlayers can improve their items through various methods, such as smithing or magical enhancement. Similarly, many items can be damaged or destroyed as a result of combat or other hazards. While special artifacts cannot be damaged or destroyed, they are also immune to any form of improvement. This presents a dilemma to characters who specialize in smithing: should they use powerful artifacts or enhanced items of their own design. It is possible for a patient, highly skilled smith to enhance weapons and armor to levels beyond that of most artifacts, but the time required may leave the character exposed to corruption.\nMonster Memory.\nA \"Monster Memory\" records the character's (not the player's) knowledge about creatures in the game, becoming increasingly detailed as the player defeats more of each monster. Statistics such as hit points, experience value, and speed are revealed, with corresponding observed highs, lows, and averages. Besides the in-game statistics, fan-submitted descriptions of every monster in the game are presented, sometimes with hints on strengths and weaknesses.\nDifficulty.\nNo matter how powerful players get, there is always a way for them to die if they become careless. In rare cases, instant deaths are possible from using cursed equipment or gaining the \"doomed\" intrinsic. Some monsters have powerful abilities that need specific counters, necessitating a change in strategy from traditional roguelike games. Some items have powerful effects on monsters. Undead beings are burnt to ash by holy symbols, and chaos beings are badly hurt by thrown potions of cure corruption. Strengths and weaknesses are often revealed in the monster memory and through rumors.\nDeath of player characters is meant to be permanent. The game exits after saving, effectively limiting savefiles to one per character, and the savefile is erased upon loading.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment of \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" started on 12 July 1994 and continued steadily until 20 November 2002. Core development on the game stopped with the release of version 1.1.1. Beta-quality ports to Mac OS X of this version appeared in 2006. Plans for future versions had not at that time been announced, but a next-generation successor to \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\", called \"JADE\", started development and betas have since been released. The developer later renamed \"Jade\" to \"Ancient Domains of Mystery II\", leaving \"Jade\" as a game engine name.\nIn July 2012 a crowdfunding campaign was initiated by Thomas Biskup to resurrect \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" development. The campaign reached its initial goal of $48,000 on 22 August, 51 days after starting, and finished at $90,169. \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" entered the Steam Greenlight in May 2014.\nAs of April 2017, a \"classic\" version is available at the main site free of charge, with two variants: the text-only version with wide platform support, and the graphical version (which also includes text-only mode) for Windows, MacOSX and Linux. A paid version is available on Steam as \"Ancient Domains of Mystery Deluxe\" with enhanced gameplay features and gameplay customization.\nAlthough \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" classic version is available free of charge, unlike most roguelikes its source code is unavailable. Despite earlier announcing that the source code would be published after the release of version 1.0, Biskup later chose to reserve it for himself in order to retain some mystery about game operation and to curtail the spread of unsanctioned variants. Despite this stance, he is open to licensing the source to capable developers to form a commercial venture. Players meanwhile have deduced underlying mechanisms through careful experimentation and reverse-engineering by inspecting the execution flow, memory and binaries of the game.\nBiskup credits his game's community following as the main reason for both of his games existence. He emphasized the importance of listening to their ideas and said he received great feedback from them through the years of development. Though most of his fan encounters are positive, he stated that he received death threats when he declined to release the game's source code and on one occasion, keen fans stalked his house.\nReception.\n\"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" has established a strong fan base that started gathering since 1997 at Usenet group \"rec.games.roguelike.adom\", sporting 2,000-3,000 messages monthly in years of active development, although lately the activity has been ceasing.\nGiven that \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" was a long-lasting development effort and new versions of the game were regularly released over the years, \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" has received many critical reviews over many varied versions. The overall critical reception is good.\nReviewers usually compare \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" to other roguelike games (like \"Rogue\", \"Angband\" or \"Moria\") and find that \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" offers a much deeper storyline, more manifold environment, and is generally more complex. Most note that \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" offers very high replay value and general randomness of events that happen in the game. Overall game system design (and especially the character development system) is usually praised for its flexibility. Some reviews note low hardware requirements and freeware distribution as essential advantages.\nThe user interface is cited to have high learning curve by some critics, while others note that it is \"brilliant in its simplicity\", \"very practical\" and \"easy to navigate\". Keyboard controls imply usage of the numeric keypad which makes \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" relatively hard to play on keyboards without keypads (i.e. some laptop keyboards). Discussing gameplay, the same complexity and randomness that were cited as positive features are sometimes said to make \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" very difficult for beginning players. Most reviewers agree that \"Ancient Domains of Mystery\" may be very hard to play for beginners due to the deletion of savefiles, which is uncommon for games outside the roguelike genre.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58990", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58990", "title": "Sin (video game)", "text": "1998 video game\nSin (stylized as SiN) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Ritual Entertainment and published by Activision in 1998. It uses a modified version of the Quake II engine. \"Sin\" is set in the dystopian future of 2037, where John Blade, a commander in a security force named HardCorps in the megacity of Freeport, is tasked to rid the city of a recreational drug that may be tied to the rival biotechnology megacorporation, SinTek.\n\"Sin\" was released to generally positive reviews, with praise going towards its level design and premise, but criticism for technical issues that resulted from a rushed release. It sold poorly as a result of competition with \"Half-Life\".\nNightdive Studios acquired the rights to \"Sin\" in 2020, and in March 2020 republished the game, along with the \"\" expansion pack, as \"Sin: Gold\". In September 2020, the studio announced plans to release a remastered version, titled \"Sin: Reloaded\", originally for a 2021 release but currently delayed to an unknown time.\nGameplay.\n\"Sin\" introduced some new features to the first-person shooter genre, such as the ability to knock the weapon out of an opponent's hand and to take area-specific damage from enemies. Although driveable vehicles did not play a big part in the game, there are some sections and levels which require the player to drive certain vehicles, including an all-terrain vehicle, a patrol boat, a forklift, and a helicopter. There are three different types of body armor\u00a0\u2013 for the legs, for the torso and for the head, with each of them depleting separately according to where the player is hit.\nComputer terminals can be manipulated through a command prompt. Many levels have multiple ways in which to complete them, and actions can trigger changes in future levels. Some of these actions can force the player to go through an entirely different set of levels.\nThe enemies can run for cover, call for reinforcements, locate the player, and respond to specific scripts.\nPlot.\nSet in the near future of 2037, many of the levels and locations are reminiscent of their current-day equivalents. Banks, building sites, sewage works and other everyday recognizable buildings form the basis of many of the levels in \"Sin\". One major difference in the world of \"Sin\" is the lack of a police force. Ten years prior to the game, the police force collapsed due to corruption and ineffectiveness against the rising tide of crime. Private security companies have taken the police's place, with some of them patrolling the streets like the former police, some in charge of protecting their employer's assets.\nOne of the companies which employ their own armed security forces is SinTEK, a large multi-national biotechnology corporation specializing in medical and chemical research, owned by the beautiful and charismatic Elexis Sinclaire. Elexis took over the company following the mysterious disappearance of her father, Dr Thrall Sinclaire, who founded it in 2005.\nThe protagonist of the game, Colonel John R. (\"Rusty\") Blade, is the commander of one of the largest security forces in the city of Freeport, HardCorps. Prior to the beginning of the game, Blade is working to rid the streets of a potent new recreational drug named U4, which is rapidly gaining popularity in Freeport and is rumoured to be able to cause genetic mutations to its users. Yet the source of the drug is still unknown, and its effects not entirely studied. As the game begins, the player is placed into the shoes of John Blade as he responds to a full-scale bank heist and hostage situation perpetrated by a well-known Freeport criminal boss Antonio Mancini. But as the player progresses and pursues the criminal behind the heist, further questions are raised: Who is really behind the heist? And is this linked to the reported appearances of mutants in the city?\nThroughout the missions, Blade is aided via radio link by a computer expert working at HardCorps: JC, a skilled hacker, capable of breaking into even the tightest of networks. In fact, Blade had first found out about JC when investigating a cracker who had broken into the HardCorps system. After tracking down the hacker, Blade, recognizing the perpetrator's talents, decided to make him a job offer at HardCorps instead of arresting him. Thus, JC became one of the HardCorps most valuable assets and the only one able to assist them in hacking-based missions.\nAs the game progresses, it is gradually revealed that the whole bank robbery is funded by Elexis Sinclaire, who in fact only wanted Mancini to steal a safety deposit box from the bank's vault. When she learns that he launched a full-scale bank heist instead, she injects him with concentrated U4 and turns him into a mutant, sending him after Blade. John manages to defeat the huge creature and afterwards learns that it was, in fact, Mancini himself. Blade also finds out that the substance found in Mancini's body after his death is only manufactured by one company: SinTEK. All these unavoidable facts force Blade to embark on an investigation into SinTEK's vast industrial area located in the outskirts of Freeport.\nLater, Blade learns that Elexis Sinclaire's main goal is to contaminate the Freeport water system with vast quantities of U4, turning all of the city's inhabitants into mutants. He manages to thwart that plan, but it turns out to be just a diversion because, in the meantime, SinTEK's troops steal nuclear warheads from a U.S. military base. Elexis threatens to fill them with U4 and launch them at specific targets, turning the entire world's population into mutants. As Blade becomes aware of that, he heads to SinTEK's main base in order to stop Sinclaire. However, once Blade defeats the SinTEK's security and mutants at the base, he reaches Sinclaire, only for her to escape by transferring her entire body into a rocket that launches itself into the sky, splits and spreads everywhere. Sinclaire disappears through the rockets, JC is unable to locate them, and in Blade's fury at the escape, he smashes a button, causing the nuclear missiles to abort their launch.\nDevelopment.\nDevelopment started in 1997, on the Quake engine. When the Quake II engine engine was completed some months later, the developers switched to that engine.\nA skeletal animation system was used for the characters.\nThe game demo was found to have a CIH virus infection in one of its mirror links. Activision had advised players only to download the game demo from their website. Due to the amount of patches which made the game more CPU-intensive, primary Amiga developer and later AmigaOS developer Hyperion Entertainment had to eventually cancel the AmigaOS version due to the lack of hardware at the time.\nVoice actress Hannah Logan, who voiced Elexis, thought she did it well as she could do \"a really low\" voice and \"do sexy vixens pretty well and it comes pretty easily.\" Logan commented on Elexis and Blade: \"Love and hate are different sides of the same coin; I think they are in 'love' with hating each other. Passion, pain, pleasure, winning, it's all the same in their cat and mouse game. ... I think Elexis is very much in touch with her 'feminine' side, but uses it in a masculine way, as a weapon. A bimbo is, ultimately, a victim. Elexis knows exactly what she is doing - she uses her sensuality to win, not that it always works, but it is definitely a \"major\" piece of ammo in her arsenal.\"\nReception.\n\"Sin\" received above-average reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. While \"PC Zone\" gave the game a \"Classic\" award, praising its inventive level design and engaging plot, most other publications did not have such a glowing view towards it. \"Next Generation\" said, \"while we feel the game may be a little light in the originality department, it certainly shines where it counts \u2013 gameplay \u2013 and [is] definitely worth your time.\"\nOne common complaint was the long load times, which measured in the minutes between each level, death, or quickload. With later patches, the long load times were greatly shortened, although compatibility with old save games was lost, forcing players to play through the game from the beginning or use cheats to progress to their previous point in the game. Another major concern was the abundance of bugs and glitches littered throughout the game. Some of the more widely reported bugs include a total lack of sound in the game, an end of chapter boss which could not move, a level on one path through the game not being finishable and general game crashes. Although these bugs were quickly patched up, the damage of the negative publicity had already been done, especially with the majority of the press reviewing the unpatched version. The patch was exceptionally large; at the time it was normal to expect a game patch file to be up to 5\u00a0MB in size, whereas \"SiN\"'s first patch was over 31\u00a0MB. This was at a time when a substantial fraction of internet access was via dial-up, causing Activision to take the unusual step of offering to send CDs containing the patch to any owners of the game who did not have sufficient bandwidth to download it from the Internet. A likely explanation for the multitude of bugs is that the game may have been rushed to meet the 1998 Christmas season, possibly as an attempt to beat \"Half-Life\" to market.\nMark Asher of \"CNET Gamecenter\" wrote, \"\"Sin\" had a good first month, but then tailed off sharply.\" Combined with the failure of competitors ' and ', its performance led him to speculate that the first-person shooter genre's market size was smaller than commonly believed, as the \"only FPS game that has done really well [over the Christmas 1998 period] is \"Half-Life\"\". However, BBC News' Alfred Hermida reported that the game had achieved \"decent success\" over the holiday shopping season, and wrote that he expected a sequel to emerge as a result.\nThe villain Elexis Sinclaire was received mostly very positively. According to \"Story-Driven Character Design\", the \"beautiful, sexy\" Elexis Sinclair was in fact the main selling point of the first game. \"PC Ultra\" included her among the three best elements of the game \"definitely the most innovative opponent seen in the latest first-person shooters.\" The character has also been often compared to Lara Croft from \"Tomb Raider\", due to both characters being seen as sex symbols in gaming. A 1999 article about female video game characters in Polish magazine \"Gambler\" opined that Elexis was a \"tremendous\" challenger for Lara, as she was \"even better built, with even greater bust and with a beauty mark like Cindy Crawford.\" However, Phaedra Boinodiris from WomenGamers.com, talking to GamesRadar in 2007, used Elexis as an example of game characters \"sexualized to the point of deformity\" as she looked \"like she crawled out of an S&amp;M club.\"\nThe game sold 350,000 units worldwide.\nSequels and other media.\nA mission pack was released for the game in 1999 by 2015, Inc., titled \". The player reprises the role of John Blade, and the story picks up after the conclusion of the main game, pitting the player against Gianni Manero, a notorious crime boss looking to take over Freeport city.\nIn 2000, ADV Films released a 60-minute anime film \". Although loosely based on the game, with similar characters and plot elements, there are some differences. For example, one of major characters from the game is killed off in the first few moments of the film; also, it takes place in the 2070s, whereas the games take place in the late 2030s.\nA sequel, \"Sin Episodes\", was made by Ritual and was intended to be released episodically over Steam network. The only episode, titled \"Emergence\", was released on May 10, 2006.\nAn alternate reality game based in the \"Sin\" universe was launched in 2005 to promote the announcement of \"Sin Episodes\". Various cryptic puzzles could be found on the website, and solving these would lead to new pieces of media and art. However, support for this piece of viral marketing by Ritual Entertainment did not last, although it has been claimed by Ritual that the final puzzles still remained unsolved.\n\"Sin\" was re-released on the Steam platform on April 5, 2006, bundled together with \"Sin Episodes: Emergence\". This version of \"Sin\" (version 1.12) includes fixes for audio and video playback problems, as well as integration with the Steam multiplayer server browser. It was reissued, along with its expansion pack \"\", on GOG.com on January 30, 2014, DRM-free and fixed for modern hardware.\nNightdive Studios, a team focused on bringing classic PC games to modern systems, acquired the rights to \"SiN\" in January 2020. On March 18, 2020, Nightdive re-released \"Sin\" on Steam and GOG as \"SiN Gold\", an updated version of the game provided for free to accounts that already owned \"SiN\". \"SiN Gold\" incorporates the \"Wages of Sin\" expansion pack, adds support for modern resolutions, restores the original game assets, and fixes many bugs.\nAdditionally, alongside the \"Gold\" edition, Nightdive announced plans for a remastered version of \"Sin\" to run on their Kex engine, scheduled for release in late 2020 or early 2021. It was announced during 3D Realms\u2019 \"Realms Deep\" digital event that the remastered version will be called \"Sin: Reloaded\", and that it will see a release in 2021. However, as of March 2025 the title remains vaporware.\nAt \"Realms Deep 2022,\" an announcement for the game \"Phantom Fury,\" a sequel to \"Ion Fury,\" was shown. Close to the end, John Blade makes an appearance, and HardCorps is mentioned briefly, implying that the two franchises are connected.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "58991", "revid": "49701263", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58991", "title": "Fog", "text": "Atmospheric phenomenon\nFog is a visible aerosol consisting of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air near the Earth's surface. Fog can be considered a type of low-lying cloud usually resembling stratus and is heavily influenced by nearby bodies of water, topography, and wind conditions. In turn, fog affects many human activities, such as shipping, travel, and warfare.\nFog appears when water vapor (water in its gaseous form) condenses. During condensation, molecules of water vapor combine to make tiny water droplets that hang in the air. Sea fog, which shows up near bodies of saline water, is formed as water vapor condenses on bits of salt. Fog is similar to, but less transparent than, mist.\nDefinition.\nThe term \"fog\" is typically distinguished from the more generic term \"cloud\" in that fog is low-lying, and the moisture in the fog is often generated locally (such as from a nearby body of water, like a lake or ocean, or from nearby moist ground or marshes). By definition, fog reduces visibility to less than , whereas mist causes lesser impairment of visibility.\nFormation.\nFog forms when the difference between air temperature and dew point is less than . Fog begins to form when water vapor condenses into tiny water droplets that are suspended in the air. Some examples of ways that water vapor is condensed include wind convergence into areas of upward motion; precipitation or virga falling from above; daytime heating evaporating water from the surface of oceans, water bodies, or wet land; transpiration from plants; cool or dry air moving over warmer water; and lifting air over mountains. Water vapor normally begins to condense on condensation nuclei such as dust, ice, and salt in order to form clouds. Fog, like its elevated cousin stratus, is a stable cloud deck which tends to form when a cool, stable air mass is trapped underneath a warm air mass.\nFog normally occurs at a relative humidity near 100%. This occurs from either added moisture in the air, or falling ambient air temperature. However, fog can form at lower humidities and can sometimes fail to form with relative humidity at 100%. At 100% relative humidity, the air cannot hold additional moisture, thus the air will become supersaturated if additional moisture is added.\nFog commonly produces precipitation in the form of drizzle or very light snow. Drizzle occurs when the humidity attains 100% and the minute cloud droplets begin to coalesce into larger droplets. This can occur when the fog layer is lifted and cooled sufficiently, or when it is forcibly compressed from above by descending air. Drizzle becomes freezing drizzle when the temperature at the surface drops below the freezing point.\nThe thickness of a fog layer is largely determined by the altitude of the inversion boundary, which in coastal or oceanic locales is also the top of the marine layer, above which the air mass is warmer and drier. The inversion boundary varies its altitude primarily in response to the weight of the air above it, which is measured in terms of atmospheric pressure. The marine layer, and any fog-bank it may contain, will be \"squashed\" when the pressure is high and conversely may expand upwards when the pressure above it is lowering.\nTypes.\nFog can form multiple ways, depending on how the cooling occurred that caused the condensation.\nRadiation fog is formed by the cooling of land after sunset by infrared thermal radiation in calm conditions with a clear sky. The cooling ground then cools adjacent air by conduction, causing the air temperature to fall and reach the dew point, forming fog. In perfect calm, the fog layer can be less than a meter thick, but turbulence can promote a thicker layer. Radiation fog occurs at night and usually does not last long after sunrise, but it can persist all day in the winter months especially in areas bounded by high ground. Radiation fog is most common in autumn and early winter. Examples of this phenomenon include tule fog.\nGround fog is fog that obscures less than 60% of the sky and does not extend to the base of any overhead clouds. However, the term is usually a synonym for shallow radiation fog; in some cases the depth of the fog is on the order of tens of centimetres over certain kinds of terrain with the absence of wind.\nAdvection fog occurs when moist air passes over a cool surface by advection (wind) and is cooled. It is common as a warm front passes over an area with significant snow-pack. It is most common at sea when moist air encounters cooler waters, including areas of cold water upwelling, such as along the California coast. A strong enough temperature difference over water or bare ground can also cause advection fog.\nAlthough strong winds often mix the air and can disperse, fragment, or prevent many kinds of fog, markedly warmer and humid air blowing over a snowpack can continue to generate advection fog at elevated velocities up to or more \u2013 this fog will be in a turbulent, rapidly moving, and comparatively shallow layer, observed as a few centimetres/inches in depth over flat farm fields, flat urban terrain and the like, and/or form more complex forms where the terrain is different such as rotating areas in the lee of hills or large buildings and so on.\nFog formed by advection along the California coastline is propelled onto land by one of several processes. A cold front can push the marine layer coast-ward, an occurrence most typical in the spring or late fall. During the summer months, a low-pressure trough produced by intense heating inland creates a strong pressure gradient, drawing in the dense marine layer. Also, during the summer, strong high pressure aloft over the desert southwest, usually in connection with the summer monsoon, produces a south to southeasterly flow which can drive the offshore marine layer up the coastline; a phenomenon known as a \"southerly surge\", typically following a coastal heat spell. However, if the monsoonal flow is sufficiently turbulent, it might instead break up the marine layer and any fog it may contain. Moderate turbulence will typically transform a fog bank, lifting it and breaking it up into shallow convective clouds called stratocumulus.\nFrontal fog forms in much the same way as stratus cloud near a front when raindrops, falling from relatively warm air above a frontal surface, evaporate into cooler air close to the Earth's surface and cause it to become saturated. The water vapor cools and at the dewpoint it condenses and fog forms. This type of fog can be the result of a very low frontal stratus cloud subsiding to surface level in the absence of any lifting agent after the front passes.\nHail fog sometimes occurs in the vicinity of significant hail accumulations due to decreased temperature and increased moisture leading to saturation in a very shallow layer near the surface. It most often occurs when there is a warm, humid layer atop the hail and when wind is light. This ground fog tends to be localized but can be extremely dense and abrupt. It may form shortly after the hail falls; when the hail has had time to cool the air and as it absorbs heat when melting and evaporating.\nFreezing conditions.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Freezing fog occurs when liquid fog droplets freeze to surfaces, forming white soft or hard rime ice. This is very common on mountain tops which are exposed to low clouds. It is equivalent to freezing rain and essentially the same as the ice that forms inside a freezer which is not of the \"frostless\" or \"frost-free\" type. The term \"freezing fog\" may also refer to fog where water vapor is super-cooled, filling the air with small ice crystals similar to very light snow. It seems to make the fog \"tangible\", as if one could \"grab a handful\".\nIn the western United States, freezing fog may be referred to as pogonip. It occurs commonly during cold winter spells, usually in deep mountain valleys. The word pogonip is derived from the Shoshone word \"pa\u03b3i\u0335nappi\u0335h\", which means \"cloud\".\nIn \"The Old Farmer's Almanac,\" in the calendar for December, the phrase \"Beware the Pogonip\" regularly appears. In his anthology \"Smoke Bellew\", Jack London describes a pogonip which surrounded the main characters, killing one of them.\nThe phenomenon is common in the inland areas of the Pacific Northwest, with temperatures in the range. The Columbia Plateau experiences this phenomenon most years during temperature inversions, sometimes lasting for as long as three weeks. The fog typically begins forming around the area of the Columbia River and expands, sometimes covering the land to distances as far away as La Pine, Oregon, almost due south of the river and into south central Washington.\nFrozen fog (also known as ice fog) is any kind of fog where the droplets have frozen into extremely tiny crystals of ice in midair. Generally, this requires temperatures at or below , making it common only in and near the Arctic and Antarctic regions. It is most often seen in urban areas where it is created by the freezing of water vapor present in automobile exhaust and combustion products from heating and power generation. Urban ice fog can become extremely dense and will persist day and night until the temperature rises. It can be associated with the diamond dust form of precipitation, in which very small crystals of ice form and slowly fall. This often occurs during blue sky conditions, which can cause many types of halos and other results of refraction of sunlight by the airborne crystals. Ice fog often leads to the visual phenomenon of light pillars.\nTopographical influences.\nUp-slope fog or hill fog forms when winds blow air up a slope (called orographic lift), adiabatically cooling it as it rises and causing the moisture in it to condense. This often causes freezing fog on mountaintops, where the cloud ceiling would not otherwise be low enough.\nValley fog forms in mountain valleys, often during winter. It is essentially a radiation fog confined by local topography and can last for several days in calm conditions. In California's Central Valley, valley fog is often referred to as tule fog.\nSea and coastal areas.\nSea fog (also known as \"haar\" or \"fret\") is heavily influenced by the presence of sea spray and microscopic airborne salt crystals. Clouds of all types require minute hygroscopic particles upon which water vapor can condense. Over the ocean surface, the most common particles are salt from salt spray produced by breaking waves. Except in areas of storminess, the most common areas of breaking waves are located near coastlines, hence the greatest densities of airborne salt particles are there.\nCondensation on salt particles has been observed to occur at humidities as low as 70%, thus fog can occur even in relatively dry air in suitable locations such as the California coast. Typically, such lower humidity fog is preceded by a transparent mistiness along the coastline as condensation competes with evaporation, a phenomenon that is typically noticeable by beachgoers in the afternoon. Another recently discovered source of condensation nuclei for coastal fog is kelp seaweed. Researchers have found that under stress (intense sunlight, strong evaporation, etc.), kelp releases particles of iodine which in turn become nuclei for condensation of water vapor, causing fog that diffuses direct sunlight.\nSea smoke, also called steam fog or evaporation fog, is created by cold air passing over warmer water or moist land. It may cause freezing fog or sometimes hoar frost. This situation can also lead to the formation of steam devils, which look like their dust counterparts. Lake-effect fog is of this type, sometimes in combination with other causes like radiation fog. It tends to differ from most advective fog formed over land in that it is (like lake-effect snow) a convective phenomenon, resulting in fog that can be very dense and deep and looks fluffy from above. Arctic sea smoke is similar to sea smoke but occurs when the air is very cold. Instead of condensing into water droplets, columns of freezing, rising, and condensing water vapor is formed. The water vapor produces the \"sea smoke fog\" and is usually misty and smoke-like.\nGar\u00faa fog near the coast of Chile and Peru occurs when typical fog produced by the sea travels inland but suddenly meets an area of hot air. This causes the water particles of fog to shrink by evaporation, producing a \"transparent mist\". Garua fog is nearly invisible, yet it still forces drivers to use windshield wipers because of condensation onto cooler hard surfaces. Camanchaca is a similar dense fog.\nEffects.\nVisibility.\nDepending on the concentration of the droplets, visibility in fog can range from the appearance of haze to almost zero visibility. Many lives are lost each year worldwide from accidents involving fog conditions on the highways, including multiple-vehicle collisions.\nThe aviation travel industry is affected by the severity of fog conditions. Even though modern auto-landing computers can put an aircraft down without the aid of a pilot, personnel manning an airport control tower must be able to see if aircraft are sitting on the runway awaiting takeoff. Safe operations are difficult in thick fog, and civilian airports may forbid takeoffs and landings until conditions improve.\nA solution for landing returning military aircraft developed in World War II was called Fog Investigation and Dispersal Operation (FIDO). It involved burning enormous amounts of fuel alongside runways to evaporate fog, allowing returning fighter and bomber pilots sufficient visual cues to safely land their aircraft. The high energy demands of this method discourage its use for routine operations.\nShadows.\nShadows are cast through fog in three dimensions. The fog is dense enough to be illuminated by light that passes through gaps in a structure or tree, but thin enough to let a large quantity of that light pass through to illuminate points further on. As a result, object shadows appear as \"beams\" oriented in a direction parallel to the light source. These voluminous shadows are created the same way as crepuscular rays, which are the shadows of clouds. In fog, it is solid objects that cast shadows.\nSound propagation and acoustics.\nSound typically travels fastest and farthest through solids, then liquids, then gases such as the atmosphere. Sound is affected during fog conditions due to the small distances between water droplets, and air temperature differences.\nThough fog is essentially liquid water, the many droplets are separated by small air gaps. High-pitched sounds have a high frequency, which in turn means they have a short wavelength. To transmit a high frequency wave, air must move back and forth very quickly. Short-wavelength high-pitched sound waves are reflected and refracted by many separated water droplets, partially cancelling and dissipating their energy (a process called \"damping\"). In contrast, low pitched notes, with a low frequency and a long wavelength, move the air less rapidly and less often, and lose less energy to interactions with small water droplets. Low-pitched notes are less affected by fog and travel further, which is why foghorns use a low-pitched tone.\nA fog can be caused by a temperature inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground, allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases the distance that lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.\nRecord extremes.\nParticularly foggy places include Hamilton, New Zealand and Grand Banks off the coast of Newfoundland (the meeting place of the cold Labrador Current from the north and the much warmer Gulf Stream from the south). Some very foggy land areas in the world include Argentia (Newfoundland) and Point Reyes (California), each with over 200 foggy days per year. Even in generally warmer southern Europe, thick fog and localized fog are often found in lowlands and valleys, such as the lower part of the Po Valley and the Arno and Tiber valleys in Italy; Ebro Valley in northeastern Spain; as well as on the Swiss plateau, especially in the Seeland area, in late autumn and winter. Other notably foggy areas include coastal Chile (in the south); coastal Namibia; Nord, Greenland; and the Severnaya Zemlya islands.\nAs a water source.\nRedwood forests in California receive approximately 30\u201340% of their moisture from coastal fog by way of fog drip. Change in climate patterns could result in relative drought in these areas. Along the coast of California, fog is the only source of water for plants and animals for up to 7 months of the year. Some animals, including insects, depend on wet fog as a principal source of water, particularly in otherwise arid climates like in many African coastal areas. Some coastal communities use fog nets to extract moisture from the atmosphere where groundwater pumping and rainwater collection are insufficient.\nArtificial fog.\nArtificial fog is man-made fog that is usually created by vaporizing a water- and glycol- or glycerine-based fluid. The fluid is injected into a heated metal block which evaporates quickly. The resulting pressure forces the vapor out of a vent. Upon coming into contact with cool outside air, the vapor condenses in microscopic droplets and appears as fog. Such fog machines are commonly used for entertainment applications.\nHistorical references.\nThe presence of fog has often played a key role in historical events, such as strategic battles. One example is the 1776 Battle of Long Island when American General George Washington and his command were able to evade imminent capture by the British Army, using fog to conceal their escape. Another example is D-Day (6 June 1944) during World War II, when the Allies landed on the beaches of Normandy, France during fog conditions. Both positive and negative results were reported from both sides during that battle, due to impaired visibility.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nUnder \"[ ^ \"Federal Meteorological Handbook Number 1: Chapter 8 \u2013 Present Weather\" (PDF).

Thus, an LFSR is most often a shift register whose input bit is driven by the XOR of some bits of the overall shift register value.\nThe initial value of the LFSR is called the seed, and because the operation of the register is deterministic, the stream of values produced by the register is completely determined by its current (or previous) state. Likewise, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it must eventually enter a repeating cycle. However, an LFSR with a well-chosen feedback function can produce a sequence of bits that appears random and has a very long cycle.\nApplications of LFSRs include generating pseudo-random numbers, pseudo-noise sequences, fast digital counters, and whitening sequences. Both hardware and software implementations of LFSRs are common.\nThe mathematics of a cyclic redundancy check, used to provide a quick check against transmission errors, are closely related to those of an LFSR. In general, the arithmetics behind LFSRs makes them very elegant as an object to study and implement. One can produce relatively complex logics with simple building blocks. However, other methods, that are less elegant but perform better, should be considered as well.\nFibonacci LFSRs.\nThe bit positions that affect the next state are called the \"taps\". In the diagram the taps are [16,14,13,11]. The rightmost bit of the LFSR is called the output bit, which is always also a tap. To obtain the next state, the tap bits are XOR-ed sequentially; then, all bits are shifted one place to the right, with the rightmost bit being discarded, and that result of XOR-ing the tap bits is fed back into the now-vacant leftmost bit. To obtain the pseudorandom output stream, read the rightmost bit after each state transition.\nThe sequence of numbers generated by an LFSR or its XNOR counterpart can be considered a binary numeral system just as valid as Gray code or the natural binary code.\nThe arrangement of taps for feedback in an LFSR can be expressed in finite field arithmetic as a polynomial mod 2. This means that the coefficients of the polynomial must be 1s or 0s. This is called the feedback polynomial or reciprocal characteristic polynomial. For example, if the taps are at the 16th, 14th, 13th and 11th bits (as shown), the feedback polynomial is\nformula_1\nThe \"one\" in the polynomial does not correspond to a tap \u2013 it corresponds to the input to the first bit (i.e. \"x\"0, which is equivalent to 1). The powers of the terms represent the tapped bits, counting from the left. The first and last bits are always connected as an input and output tap respectively.\nThe LFSR is maximal-length if and only if the corresponding feedback polynomial is primitive over the Galois field GF(2). This means that the following conditions are necessary (but not sufficient):\nTables of primitive polynomials from which maximum-length LFSRs can be constructed are given below and in the references.\nThere can be more than one maximum-length tap sequence for a given LFSR length. Also, once one maximum-length tap sequence has been found, another automatically follows. If the tap sequence in an \"n\"-bit LFSR is [\"n\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", 0], where the 0 corresponds to the \"x\"0\u00a0=\u00a01 term, then the corresponding \"mirror\" sequence is [\"n\", \"n\" \u2212 \"C\", \"n\" \u2212 \"B\", \"n\" \u2212 \"A\", 0]. So the tap sequence [32, 22, 2, 1, 0] has as its counterpart [32, 31, 30, 10, 0]. Both give a maximum-length sequence.\nAn example in C is below:\nunsigned lfsr_fib(void)\n uint16_t start_state = 0xACE1u; /* Any nonzero start state will work. */\n uint16_t lfsr = start_state;\n uint16_t bit; /* Must be 16-bit to allow bit\u00ab15 later in the code */\n unsigned period = 0;\n do\n { /* taps: 16 14 13 11; feedback polynomial: x^16 + x^14 + x^13 + x^11 + 1 */\n bit = ((lfsr \u00bb 0) ^ (lfsr \u00bb 2) ^ (lfsr \u00bb 3) ^ (lfsr \u00bb 5)) &amp; 1u;\n lfsr = (lfsr \u00bb 1) | (bit \u00ab 15);\n ++period;\n while (lfsr != start_state);\n return period;\nIf a fast parity or popcount operation is available, the feedback bit can be computed more efficiently as the dot product of the register with the characteristic polynomial:\nIf a rotation operation is available, the new state can be computed as\nThis LFSR configuration is also known as standard, many-to-one or external XOR gates. The alternative Galois configuration is described in the next section.\nExample in Python.\nA sample python implementation of a similar (16 bit taps at [16,15,13,4]) Fibonacci LFSR would be\nstart_state = 1 \u00ab 15 | 1\nlfsr = start_state\nperiod = 0\nwhile True:\n # taps: 16 15 13 4; feedback polynomial: x^16 + x^15 + x^13 + x^4 + 1\n bit = (lfsr ^ (lfsr \u00bb 1) ^ (lfsr \u00bb 3) ^ (lfsr \u00bb 12)) &amp; 1\n lfsr = (lfsr \u00bb 1) | (bit \u00ab 15)\n period += 1\n if lfsr == start_state:\n print(period)\n break\nWhere a register of 16 bits is used and the xor tap at the fourth, 13th, 15th and sixteenth bit establishes a maximum sequence length.\nGalois LFSRs.\nNamed after the French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois, an LFSR in Galois configuration, which is also known as modular, internal XORs, or one-to-many LFSR, is an alternate structure that can generate the same output stream as a conventional LFSR (but offset in time). In the Galois configuration, when the system is clocked, bits that are not taps are shifted one position to the right unchanged. The taps, on the other hand, are XORed with the output bit before they are stored in the next position. The new output bit is the next input bit. The effect of this is that when the output bit is zero, all the bits in the register shift to the right unchanged, and the input bit becomes zero. When the output bit is one, the bits in the tap positions all flip (if they are 0, they become 1, and if they are 1, they become 0), and then the entire register is shifted to the right and the input bit becomes 1.\nTo generate the same output stream, the order of the taps is the \"counterpart\" (see above) of the order for the conventional LFSR, otherwise the stream will be in reverse. Note that the internal state of the LFSR is not necessarily the same. The Galois register shown has the same output stream as the Fibonacci register in the first section. A time offset exists between the streams, so a different startpoint will be needed to get the same output each cycle.\nBelow is a C code example for the 16-bit maximal-period Galois LFSR example in the figure:\nunsigned lfsr_galois(void)\n uint16_t start_state = 0xACE1u; /* Any nonzero start state will work. */\n uint16_t lfsr = start_state;\n unsigned period = 0;\n do\n unsigned lsb = lfsr &amp; 1u; /* Get LSB (i.e., the output bit). */\n lfsr \u00bb= 1; /* Shift register */\n if (lsb) /* If the output bit is 1, */\n lfsr ^= 0xB400u; /* apply toggle mask. */\n unsigned msb = (int16_t) lfsr &lt; 0; /* Get MSB (i.e., the output bit). */\n lfsr \u00ab= 1; /* Shift register */\n if (msb) /* If the output bit is 1, */\n lfsr ^= 0x002Du; /* apply toggle mask. */\n ++period;\n while (lfsr != start_state);\n return period;\nThe branch if (lsb) lfsr ^= 0xB400u;can also be written as lfsr ^= (-lsb) &amp; 0xB400u; which may produce more efficient code on some compilers. In addition, the left-shifting variant may produce even better code, as the msb is the carry from the addition of codice_3 to itself.\nGalois LFSR parallel computation.\nState and resulting bits can also be combined and computed in parallel. The following function calculates the next 64 bits using the 63-bit polynomial formula_2:\nuint64_t prsg63(uint64_t lfsr) {\n lfsr = lfsr \u00ab 32 | (lfsr\u00ab1 ^ lfsr\u00ab2) \u00bb 32;\n lfsr = lfsr \u00ab 32 | (lfsr\u00ab1 ^ lfsr\u00ab2) \u00bb 32;\n return lfsr;\nNon-binary Galois LFSR.\nBinary Galois LFSRs like the ones shown above can be generalized to any \"q\"-ary alphabet {0, 1, ..., \"q\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01} (e.g., for binary, \"q\" = 2, and the alphabet is simply {0, 1}). In this case, the exclusive-or component is generalized to addition modulo-\"q\" (note that XOR is addition modulo 2), and the feedback bit (output bit) is multiplied (modulo-\"q\") by a \"q\"-ary value, which is constant for each specific tap point. Note that this is also a generalization of the binary case, where the feedback is multiplied by either 0 (no feedback, i.e., no tap) or 1 (feedback is present). Given an appropriate tap configuration, such LFSRs can be used to generate Galois fields for arbitrary prime values of \"q\".\nXorshift LFSRs.\nAs shown by George Marsaglia and further analysed by Richard P. Brent, linear feedback shift registers can be implemented using XOR and Shift operations. This approach lends itself to fast execution in software because these operations typically map efficiently into modern processor instructions.\nBelow is a C code example for a 16-bit maximal-period Xorshift LFSR using the 7,9,13 triplet from John Metcalf:\nunsigned lfsr_xorshift(void)\n uint16_t start_state = 0xACE1u; /* Any nonzero start state will work. */\n uint16_t lfsr = start_state;\n unsigned period = 0;\n do\n { // 7,9,13 triplet from http://www.retroprogramming.com/2017/07/xorshift-pseudorandom-numbers-in-z80.html\n lfsr ^= lfsr \u00bb 7;\n lfsr ^= lfsr \u00ab 9;\n lfsr ^= lfsr \u00bb 13;\n ++period;\n while (lfsr != start_state);\n return period;\nMatrix forms.\nBinary LFSRs of both Fibonacci and Galois configurations can be expressed as linear functions using matrices in formula_3 (see GF(2)). Using the companion matrix of the characteristic polynomial of the LFSR and denoting the seed as a column vector formula_4, the state of the register in Fibonacci configuration after formula_5 steps is given by\nformula_6\nMatrix for the corresponding Galois form is :\nformula_7\nFor a suitable initialisation, \nformula_8\nthe top coefficient of the column vector :\nformula_9\ngives the term \"a\"\"k\" of the original sequence.\nThese forms generalize naturally to arbitrary fields.\nExample polynomials for maximal LFSRs.\nThe following table lists examples of maximal-length feedback polynomials (primitive polynomials) for shift-register lengths up to 24. The formalism for maximum-length LFSRs was developed by Solomon W. Golomb in his 1967 book. The number of different primitive polynomials grows exponentially with shift-register length and can be calculated exactly using Euler's totient function (sequence in the OEIS).\nApplications.\nLFSRs can be implemented in hardware, and this makes them useful in applications that require very fast generation of a pseudo-random sequence, such as direct-sequence spread spectrum radio. LFSRs have also been used for generating an approximation of white noise in various programmable sound generators.\nUses as counters.\nThe repeating sequence of states of an LFSR allows it to be used as a clock divider or as a counter when a non-binary sequence is acceptable, as is often the case where computer index or framing locations need to be machine-readable. LFSR counters have simpler feedback logic than natural binary counters or Gray-code counters, and therefore can operate at higher clock rates. However, it is necessary to ensure that the LFSR never enters a lockup state (all zeros for a XOR based LFSR, and all ones for a XNOR based LFSR), for example by presetting it at start-up to any other state in the sequence. It is possible to count up and down with a LFSR. LFSR have also been used as a https://, this requires that the program itself is \"scrambled\" and it done to save on gates when they are a premium (using fewer gates than an adder) and for speed (as a LFSR does not require a long carry chain).\nThe table of primitive polynomials shows how LFSRs can be arranged in Fibonacci or Galois form to give maximal periods. One can obtain any other period by adding to an LFSR that has a longer period some logic that shortens the sequence by skipping some states.\nUses in cryptography.\nLFSRs have long been used as pseudo-random number generators for use in stream ciphers, due to the ease of construction from simple electromechanical or electronic circuits, long periods, and very uniformly distributed output streams. However, an LFSR is a linear system, leading to fairly easy cryptanalysis. For example, given a stretch of known plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, an attacker can intercept and recover a stretch of LFSR output stream used in the system described, and from that stretch of the output stream can construct an LFSR of minimal size that simulates the intended receiver by using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. This LFSR can then be fed the intercepted stretch of output stream to recover the remaining plaintext.\nThree general methods are employed to reduce this problem in LFSR-based stream ciphers:\nImportant LFSR-based stream ciphers include A5/1 and A5/2, used in GSM cell phones, E0, used in Bluetooth, and the shrinking generator. The A5/2 cipher has been broken and both A5/1 and E0 have serious weaknesses.\nThe linear feedback shift register has a strong relationship to linear congruential generators.\nUses in circuit testing.\nLFSRs are used in circuit testing for test-pattern generation (for exhaustive testing, pseudo-random testing or pseudo-exhaustive testing) and for signature analysis.\nTest-pattern generation.\nComplete LFSR are commonly used as pattern generators for exhaustive testing, since they cover all possible inputs for an \"n\"-input circuit. Maximal-length LFSRs and weighted LFSRs are widely used as pseudo-random test-pattern generators for pseudo-random test applications.\nSignature analysis.\nIn built-in self-test (BIST) techniques, storing all the circuit outputs on chip is not possible, but the circuit output can be compressed to form a signature that will later be compared to the golden signature (of the good circuit) to detect faults. Since this compression is lossy, there is always a possibility that a faulty output also generates the same signature as the golden signature and the faults cannot be detected. This condition is called error masking or aliasing. BIST is accomplished with a multiple-input signature register (MISR or MSR), which is a type of LFSR. A standard LFSR has a single XOR or XNOR gate, where the input of the gate is connected to several \"taps\" and the output is connected to the input of the first flip-flop. A MISR has the same structure, but the input to every flip-flop is fed through an XOR/XNOR gate. For example, a 4-bit MISR has a 4-bit parallel output and a 4-bit parallel input. The input of the first flip-flop is XOR/XNORd with parallel input bit zero and the \"taps\". Every other flip-flop input is XOR/XNORd with the preceding flip-flop output and the corresponding parallel input bit. Consequently, the next state of the MISR depends on the last several states opposed to just the current state. Therefore, a MISR will always generate the same golden signature given that the input sequence is the same every time.\nRecent applications are proposing set-reset flip-flops as \"taps\" of the LFSR. This allows the BIST system to optimise storage, since set-reset flip-flops can save the initial seed to generate the whole stream of bits from the LFSR. Nevertheless, this requires changes in the architecture of BIST, is an option for specific applications.\nUses in digital broadcasting and communications.\nScrambling.\nTo prevent short repeating sequences (e.g., runs of 0s or 1s) from forming spectral lines that may complicate symbol tracking at the\nreceiver or interfere with other transmissions, the data bit sequence is combined with the output of a linear-feedback register before modulation and transmission. This scrambling is removed at the receiver after demodulation. When the LFSR runs at the same bit rate as the transmitted symbol stream, this technique is referred to as scrambling. When the LFSR runs considerably faster than the symbol stream, the LFSR-generated bit sequence is called \"chipping code\". The chipping code is combined with the data using exclusive or before transmitting using binary phase-shift keying or a similar modulation method. The resulting signal has a higher bandwidth than the data, and therefore this is a method of spread-spectrum communication. When used only for the spread-spectrum property, this technique is called direct-sequence spread spectrum; when used to distinguish several signals transmitted in the same channel at the same time and frequency, it is called code-division multiple access.\nNeither scheme should be confused with encryption or encipherment; scrambling and spreading with LFSRs do \"not\" protect the information from eavesdropping. They are instead used to produce equivalent streams that possess convenient engineering properties to allow robust and efficient modulation and demodulation.\nDigital broadcasting systems that use linear-feedback registers:\nOther digital communications systems using LFSRs:\nOther uses.\nLFSRs are also used in radio jamming systems to generate pseudo-random noise to raise the noise floor of a target communication system.\nThe German time signal DCF77, in addition to amplitude keying, employs phase-shift keying driven by a 9-stage LFSR to increase the accuracy of received time and the robustness of the data stream in the presence of noise.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

A technical hitch occurred and there was a black-out, but Coleman could be heard calling out to the technician in the studio, \"Trust you to make a balls of that.\" Coleman's association with these verbal slips is so strong that he is often given erroneous credit for the earliest example specifically referenced as a Colemanballs; in fact the broadcaster responsible was a fellow BBC commentator, Ron Pickering. At the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Pickering commentated on a race involving the Cuban double-gold medallist Alberto Juantorena, whose muscular build and nine-foot stride contributed to his nickname \"El Caballo\" (The Horse).

Though the present province of Gelderland (English also \"Guelders\") in the Netherlands occupies most of the area, the former duchy also comprised parts of the present Dutch province of Limburg as well as those territories in the present-day German state of North Rhine-Westphalia that were acquired by Prussia in 1713, which included the duchy's capital Geldern.\nFour parts of the duchy had their own centres, as rivers separated them:\nspatially separated from the Lower Quarters (Gelderland):\nHistory.\nWassenberg and J\u00fclich dynasties (c.1096\u20131423).\nThe county emerged about 1096 when the first documented reference to Gerard III of Wassenberg as \"Count of Guelders\" occurred. It was then located on the territory of Lower Lorraine, in the area of Geldern and Roermond, with its main stronghold at Montfort (built 1260). Count Gerard's son Gerard II in 1127 acquired the County of Zutphen in northern Hamaland by marriage. In the 12th and 13th centuries, Guelders quickly expanded downstream along the sides of the Maas, Rhine, and IJssel rivers and even claimed the succession in the Duchy of Limburg, until it lost the 1288 Battle of Worringen against Berg and Brabant.\nGuelders was often at war with its neighbours, not only with Brabant but also with the County of Holland and the Bishopric of Utrecht. However, its territory grew not only because of its success in warfare but also because it thrived in times of peace. For example, the larger part of the Veluwe and the city of Nijmegen were given as collateral to Guelders by their cash-strapped rulers. On separate occasions, in return for loans from the treasury of Guelders, the bishop of Utrecht granted the taxation and administration of the Veluwe, and William II \u2013 Count of both Holland and Zeeland, and who was elected anti-king of the Holy Roman Empire (1248\u20131256) \u2013 similarly granted the same rights over Nijmegen; as neither ruler proved able to repay their debts, these lands became integral parts of Guelders.\nIn 1339, the Emperor Louis IV of Wittelsbach elevated Count Reginald II of Guelders (also styled Rainald), of the House of Wassenberg, to the rank of Duke. After the Wassenberg line became extinct in 1371 following the deaths of Reginald II's childless sons Edward II (on 24 August, from wounds suffered in the Battle of Baesweiler) and Reginald III (on 4 December), the ensuing Guelders War of Succession (1371 to 1379) saw William I of J\u00fclich emerge victorious. William was confirmed in the inheritance of Guelders in 1379, and from 1393 onwards held both duchies in personal union (in Guelders as William I, and J\u00fclich as William III).\nEgmond and Burgundian dynasties (1423\u20131477).\nIn 1423, Guelders passed to the House of Egmond, which gained recognition of its title from Emperor Sigismund of Luxembourg but was unable to escape the political strife and internecine conflict that had so plagued the preceding House of J\u00fclich-Hengebach, and more especially, the pressure brought to bear by the expansionist rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy. The first Egmond Duke, Arnold, suffered the rebellion of his son Adolf and was imprisoned by the latter in 1465. Adolf, who had enjoyed the support of Burgundian Duke Philip III (\"the Good\") and of the four major cities of Guelders during his rebellion, was unwilling to strike a compromise with his father when this was demanded by Philip's successor, Duke Charles the Bold. Charles had Duke Adolf captured and imprisoned in 1471 and reinstated Arnold on the throne of the Duchy of Guelders. Charles then bought the reversion (i.e., the right of succession to the throne) from Duke Arnold, who, against the will of the towns and the law of the land, pledged his duchy to Charles for 300,000 Rhenish florins. The bargain was completed in 1472\u201373. Upon Arnold's death in 1473, Duke Charles added Guelders to the \"Low Countries\" portion of his Valois Duchy of Burgundy.\nHabsburg dynasty (1477\u20131549).\nUpon Charles' defeat and death at the Battle of Nancy in January 1477, Duke Adolf was released from prison by the Flemish. Still, he died the same year at the head of a Flemish army besieging Tournai after the States of Guelders had recognized him once more as Duke. Subsequently, Guelders was ruled by Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, husband of Charles the Bold's daughter and heir, Mary.\nThe last independent Duke of Guelders was Adolf's son Charles of Egmond (1467\u20131538, r. 1492\u20131538), who was raised at the Burgundian court of Charles the Bold and fought for the House of Habsburg in battles against the armies of Charles VIII of France until being captured in the Battle of B\u00e9thune (1487) during the War of the Public Weal (also known as the \"Mad War\"). In 1492, the citizens of Guelders, who had become disenchanted with the rule of Maximilian, ransomed Charles and recognized him as their Duke. Charles, now backed by France, fought Maximilian's grandson Charles of Habsburg (who became Holy Roman Emperor, as Charles V, in 1519) in the Guelders Wars and expanded his realm further north, to incorporate what is now the Province of Overijssel. He was not simply a man of war but also a skilled diplomat and was, therefore, able to keep his independence. He bequeathed the duchy to Duke William the Rich of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg (also known as Wilhelm of Cleves). Following in the footsteps of Charles of Egmond, Duke William formed an alliance with France, an alliance dubiously cemented via his political marriage to French King Francis I's niece Jeanne d'Albret (who reportedly had to be whipped into submission to the marriage, and later bodily carried to the altar by the Constable of France, Anne de Montmorency). This alliance emboldened William to challenge Emperor Charles V's claim to Guelders, but the French, mightily engaged on multiple fronts as they were in the long struggle to against the Habsburg \"encirclement\" of France, proved less reliable than the Duke's ambitions required, and he was unable to hold on to the duchy; in 1543, by the terms of the Treaty of Venlo, Duke William conceded the Duchy of Guelders to the Emperor.\nPart of the Seventeen Provinces.\nEmperor Charles V united Guelders with the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands by the Pragmatic Sanction of 1549, and Guelders thus lost its independence.\nCharles abdicated in 1556 and decreed that the territories of the Burgundian Circle should be held by the Spanish Crown. When the Netherlands revolted against King Philip II of Spain in the Dutch Revolt, the three northern quarters of Gelderland joined the Union of Utrecht and became part of the United Provinces upon the 1581 Act of Abjuration, while only the Upper Quarter remained a part of the Spanish Netherlands.\nAt the Treaty of Utrecht, ending the War of the Spanish Succession in 1713, the Spanish Upper Quarter was again divided between Prussian Guelders (Geldern, Viersen, Horst, Venray), the United Provinces (Venlo, Montfort, Echt), Austria (this part continued as the duchy: Roermond, Niederkr\u00fcchten, Weert), and the Duchy of J\u00fclich (Erkelenz). In 1795, Guelders was finally conquered and incorporated by the French First Republic and partitioned between the d\u00e9partements of Roer and Meuse-Inf\u00e9rieure.\nCoat of arms of Guelders.\nThe coat of arms of the region changed over time.\nGuelders in popular culture.\nWilliam Thatcher, the lead character in the 2001 film \"A Knight's Tale\" played by Heath Ledger, claimed to be Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein from Gelderland to appear to be of noble birth and thus qualify to participate in jousting.\nSet in the late 1460s, the main character in Rafael Sabatini's 1929 novel \"The Romantic Prince\" is Count Anthony of Guelders, elder son of Duke Arnold and brother to Adolf \"since then happily vanished\". Sabatini weaves the historical characters and events of the period through the story.\nThe folk/metalband Heidevolk, based in Gelderland, composed and performs a range of songs about Gelre/Guelders, among them a contemporary anthem \"\".\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59003", "revid": "17216044", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59003", "title": "Ludlow", "text": "Town and civil parish in Shropshire, England\nLudlow ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England. It is located south of Shrewsbury and north of Hereford, on the A49 road which bypasses the town. The town is near the confluence of the rivers Corve and Teme.\nThe oldest part is the medieval walled town, founded in the late 11th century after the Norman conquest of England. It is centred on a small hill which lies on the eastern bank of a bend of the River Teme. Situated on this hill are Ludlow Castle and the parish church, St Laurence's, the largest in the county. From there the streets slope downward to the rivers Corve and Teme, to the north and south respectively. The town is in a sheltered spot beneath Mortimer Forest and the Clee Hills, which are clearly visible from the town.\nLudlow has nearly 500 listed buildings, including examples of medieval and Tudor-style half-timbered buildings. The town was described by Sir John Betjeman as \"probably the loveliest town in England\".\nToponymy.\nThe thirteenth century romance \"Fouke le Fitz Waryn\" records that Ludlow had been called Dinam \"for a very long time\". It is also known that Ludlow Castle was originally named Dinham Castle when it was constructed in the eleventh century, even today the area immediately south of the castle retains the original name. Samuel Lewis states that while \"Leadlowe\" and \"Ludlowe\" were the Saxon names for the town, the British name was \"Dinam\", which he translates as \"The Palace of Princes\". Even in the eighteenth century, Daniel Defoe recorded that \"the Welch call this town \"Llys Tywysog\", which is in English, the Prince's Court.\"\n\"Lodelowe\" was in use for this site before 1138 and comes from the Old English \"hlud-hl\u01e3w\". At the time this section of the River Teme contained rapids, and so the \"hlud\" of Ludlow came from \"the loud waters\", while \"hl\u01e3w\" meant \"hill\" or tumulus. Thus the name Ludlow describes a \"place on a hill by the loud waters\". Some time around the 12th century, weirs were added along the river, taming these rapid flows. The hill is that which the town stands on, and a pre-historic burial mound (or barrow) which existed at the eastern summit of the hill (dug up during the expansion of St Laurence's church in 1199) could explain the tumulus variation of the \"hl\u01e3w\" element. Ludford, a neighbouring and older settlement, situated on the southern bank of the Teme, shares the \"hlud\" (\"loud waters\") element.\nHistory.\nThe town is situated close to Wales, and lies near the midpoint of the England\u2013Wales border; it is also very close to the county border between Shropshire and Herefordshire (neighbouring Ludford remained part of Herefordshire until 1895). This strategic location invested it with national importance in medieval times, and thereafter with the town being the seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches during its existence (1472 to 1689).\nMedieval history.\nAt the time of the Domesday Book survey, the area was part of the large Stanton parish and manor, a possession of Walter de Lacy. Neither Ludlow nor Dinham are mentioned in the Book, compiled in 1086, although the Book recorded manors and not settlements \"per se\". The Book does record a great number of households and taxable value for Stanton, perhaps suggesting that any early settlement by the nascent castle was being counted. Neighbouring places Ludford, the Sheet and Steventon do feature in the Book, as they were manors, proving that they were well-established places by the Norman conquest. The manor of Stanton came within the hundred of Culvestan, but during the reign of Henry I this Saxon hundred was merged into the new Munslow hundred.\nWalter's son Roger de Lacy began the construction of Ludlow Castle on the western promontory of the hill about 1075, forming what is now the inner bailey. Between about 1090 and 1120, the Chapel of St. Mary Magdalene was built inside the walls, and by 1130 the Great Tower was added to form the gatehouse. About 1170 the larger outer bailey was added to the castle. (The town walls however were not built until the mid-13th century.) The settlement of Dinham grew up alongside the development of the early castle in the late 11th century, with the northern part of this early settlement disturbed by the building of the outer bailey. Dinham had its own place of worship, the Chapel of St Thomas the Martyr, dedicated to Thomas Becket sometime in 1177\u20131189 when the present chapel replaced an older (late 11th-century) church building.\nDuring the 12th century, the planned town of Ludlow was formed, in stages, the town providing a useful source of income for successive Marcher Lords, based on rents, fines, and tolls. They developed the town on a regular grid pattern, although this was adapted somewhat to match the local topography, from the late 11th century through the 12th century. The first laid street was along the ridge of the hilltop, what is now Castle Square, High Street and King Street. This formed a wide market place (later in-filled by buildings in places) running from the castle gates east across to St Laurence's and the Bull Ring, itself located on the ancient north\u2013south road, now called Corve Street to the north and Old Street to the south. The wide Mill and Broad Streets were added later, as part of a southern grid plan of streets and burgage plots filling the area bounded by Dinham, the new High Street market, Old Street and the Teme to the south. Originally, Old Street ran down to a ford which took the ancient route south across to Ludford. A bridge was constructed (possibly by Josce de Dinan) at the foot of Broad Street, upstream of the ford, which then replaced the ford; its 15th-century replacement is the present-day Ludford Bridge.\nSt Laurence's church, whose origins are late 11th century, was rebuilt and enlarged (with a bell tower) in 1199-1200 and became a parish church, with the separation of Ludlow from the parish of Stanton Lacy by 1200. The town notably had two schools (a choir and a grammar) in existence c.\u20091200; Ludlow Grammar School remained in existence until 1977, when it became Ludlow College.\nLudlow Castle was an important border fortification along the Welsh Marches, and one of the largest in the Norman/English ring of castles surrounding Wales. It played a significant role in local, regional and national conflicts such as the Owain Glynd\u0175r rebellion, the Wars of the Roses and the English Civil War. The castle and its adjoining town grew in political importance and in the 15th century the castle became the seat of the Council of Wales and the Marches. It was a temporary home to several holders of the title Prince of Wales, including King Edward V and Arthur Tudor, who died there in 1502.\nThe site features heavily in the folk-story of Fulk FitzWarin, outlawed Lord of Whittington, Shropshire and a possible inspiration for the \"Robin Hood\" legend. Fulk is brought up in the castle of Josce de Dinan, and fights for his master against Sir Gilbert de Lacy \u2013 these battles are the source of the story of Marion de la Bruyere, the betrayed lover whose ghost is still said to be heard screaming as she plummets from the castle's turrets.\nThe first recorded royal permission to maintain defensive town walls was given to the \"men of Ludlow\" in the Patent Rolls of 1233. The entry is however incomplete and atypical and was not renewed in the usual way. A murage grant was next made in 1260 and renewed regularly over the next two centuries. This time the grant was made by name to Geoffrey de Genevile, Lord of Ludlow. From this and other surviving documents it seems that the town walls and gates were in place by 1270. They were constructed about the central part of the community with four main gates and three postern gates. Because the walls were constructed after the development of the town's streets, the positions and names of the four main gates are based on the streets they crossed; the postern gates on the other hand are located by and named after old outlying districts. The 7 gates are (clockwise from the castle; postern gates in \"italics\") \"Linney\", Corve, \"Galdeford\", Old, Broad, Mill and \"Dinham\". An eighth unnamed 'portal' gate (smaller than a postern gate) existed in the wall just to the northwest of the castle, now in the gardens of Castle Walk House. The town walls are largely still in existence, although a section alongside the churchyard of St Lawrence's is, as of 2015, in need of repairs.\nThe castle complex continued to expand (a Great Hall, kitchen and living quarters were added) and it gained a reputation as a fortified palace. In 1306 it passed through marriage to the ambitious Earl of March, Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March. Queen Isabella and her son, the young Edward III, were entertained at the castle in 1329.\nMarcher town.\nThe town prospered, with a population of about 1,725 by 1377, and sustained a population of about 2,000 for several centuries thereafter. It was a market town; market day was held on every Thursday throughout the 15th century. In particular, it served as a centre for the sale of wool and cloth. It was home to various trades, and in 1372 boasted 12 trade guilds including metalworkers, shoemakers, butchers, drapers, mercers, tailors, cooks, bakers and probably the most notable in the town, the Palmer's Guild.\nIn the mid sixteenth century the London merchant Sir Rowland Hill gave the money for a new bridge over the Teme, and the annual St. Catherine's fair.\nThere were merchants of moderate wealth in the town and especially wool merchants, such as Laurence of Ludlow, who lived at nearby Stokesay Castle. The collection and sale of wool and the manufacture of cloth continued to be the primary source of wealth until the 17th century.\nThis prosperity is expressed in stone masonry, wood carvings and stained-glass at St. Laurence's parish church; effectively a wool church, it is the largest in Shropshire and a member of the Greater Churches Group. Despite the presence of some Decorated work it is largely Perpendicular in style. Its size and grandeur has given it the nickname \"the cathedral of the Marches\", and from 1981 to 2020 there was a suffragan Bishop of Ludlow.\nDuring the Wars of the Roses, the castle\u2014which he held through his Mortimer inheritance\u2014was one of Richard, Duke of York's main strongholds. The Lancastrian forces captured Ludlow in 1459, at the Rout of Ludford Bridge, but the Yorkists won control of England in 1461. The castle became property of the Crown, passing to Richard's son, Edward IV. The town rose in prominence under Edward's reign and was incorporated as a borough, and began sending representatives to Parliament. Edward set up the Council of Wales and the Marches in 1472, headquartering it at Ludlow, and sent his son Edward, Prince of Wales, to live there, as nominal (being only a young boy) head of the council. It was at Ludlow that the young prince heard the news of his father's death in 1483 and was himself proclaimed King Edward V of England. It was from Ludlow that Edward V was brought back to London with his young brother, both to be confined in the Tower of London when, after a short period of time, they were never seen again.\nUnder Henry VII the castle continued as the headquarters of the Council of Wales and served as the administration centre for Wales and the counties along the border, known as the Welsh Marches. During this period, when the town served as the effective capital of Wales, it was home to many messengers of the king, various clerks and lawyers for settling legal disputes. The town also provided a winter home for local gentry, during which time they attended the council court sessions. Henry VII sent his heir Prince Arthur to Ludlow, where he was joined briefly by his wife Catherine of Aragon later to become wife to Henry VIII. Ludlow Castle was therefore the site of perhaps the most controversial honeymoon in English history, when Catherine's claim that the marriage was never consummated became central to the dispute concerning Henry VIII and Catherine's annulment in 1531.\nEventually, the council resumed and except for brief interludes, Ludlow continued to host the council until 1689, when it was abolished by William III and Mary II as part of the Glorious Revolution. The castle then fell into decay. The structure was poorly maintained and the stone was pillaged. In 1772 demolition was mooted, but it was instead decided to lease the buildings. Later still it was purchased by the Earl of Powis, and together, he and his wife directed the transformation of the castle grounds.\nThe Royal Welch Fusiliers were formed by Henry Herbert, 4th Baron Herbert of Chirbury at Ludlow in March 1689 to oppose James II and to take part in the imminent war with France. The regiment continued to have ties with the town of Ludlow, and its successor battalion in The Royal Welsh regiment was granted the freedom of the town in 2014.\n18th and 19th centuries.\nThe town contained several coaching inns, public houses and ale houses, leading to court records of some alcohol-induced violence and a certain reputation for excess. Several coaching inns were constructed to accommodate travellers by stagecoach and mail coach. The Angel on Broad Street was one such notable coaching inn, where several passenger and mail coaches departed and arrived on a regular basis every week, including the \"Aurora\" coach which departed for London (taking 27 hours in 1822). The Angel was the last coaching inn in Ludlow to have such coach traffic, following the arrival of the railways in 1852. The Angel ceased trading in the early 1990s, though was revived in 2018 as a wine bar occupying a front part of the original establishment. A surviving medieval coaching inn today is the 15th century Bull Hotel on the Bull Ring. Several other pubs and hotels in the town have historic pedigree, including the Rose and Crown where allegedly a pub has existed since 1102.\nGlove manufacture was a major industry of the town, peaking in production in 1814.\nIn 1802, Horatio Nelson was awarded the freedom of the borough and stayed at The Angel coaching inn on Broad Street, together with his mistress Emma and her husband Sir William Hamilton. The honour was presented to him in a room at the inn, later to be known as the Nelson Room, and he addressed the crowds from one of the bay windows on the first floor. During the Napoleonic Wars, Lucien Bonaparte, younger brother of the French Emperor, and his family were imprisoned at Dinham House in 1811.\nIn 1832 Thomas Lloyd, the Ludlow doctor and amateur geologist, met Roderick Murchison at Ludford Corner to study the rocks exposed along the River Teme and on Whitcliffe, advancing Murchison's theory for a Silurian System that he was to publish in 1839. Immediately above the topmost layer of the marine rock sequence forming Murchison's Silurian System was a thin layer of dark sand containing numerous remains of early fish, especially their scales, along with plant debris, spores and microscopic mites. In contrast to the underlying sediments of the Ludlow Series which were deposited in a shallow warm sea some 400 million years ago, the Ludlow Bone Bed represents terrestrial (land) conditions and thus a fundamental change in the landscape. At the time, this was believed to be the earliest occurrence of life on land. Murchison thus took the Ludlow Bone Bed as the base of his Devonian System, although over a century later this boundary was to be moved a little higher, the overlying rocks being ascribed to the Pridoli. The science of geology has taken a number of local names from these studies and now applies them worldwide, in recognition of the importance of this area to scientific understanding, for example, Ludlow Series. The site is now an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and still attracts international studies. The geological interval of time, the Ludlow Epoch, is named after the town as part of the Silurian Period.\nRecent history.\nBy the late 20th century, the town had seen a growth in tourism, leading to the appearance of many antique dealers, as well as art dealers and independent bookshops (the latter now mostly gone). Bodenhams, a clothing retailer, has been trading from a 600-year-old timbered building since 1860 and is one of the oldest stores in Britain. Ludlow was described by \"Country Life\" as \"the most vibrant small town in England.\"\nA long battle of words between local activists (including many of the town's independent businesses) and Tesco was eventually solved when the mega retailer obtained planning permission to build a supermarket on Corve Street, on the northern edge of the town centre, but only after agreeing to conform to the architectural demands of the local council. The building is designed to follow the outline of the hills in the background, with a curving roof. An Aldi supermarket was subsequently constructed on a site over the road from Tesco.\nA development of 91 houses by South Shropshire Housing Association at Rocks Green won a Sustainable Housing award in 2009, and a Sainsbury's supermarket at Rocks Green was opened in 2021.\nIn 1983 a small computer magazine started publication in Ludlow by Roger Kean, Oliver Frey and Franco Frey by Newsfield Publications Ltd called Crash. The magazine catered for the various owners of the ZX Spectrum, and its sister magazine \"Zzap!64\" catered for Commodore's rival machine the C64. The magazine was extremely popular and became Britain's biggest-selling computer magazine in 1986 selling over 100,000 copies monthly. In 1991 Newsfield suffered financial difficulty and the magazines were sold and relaunched by Europress.\nIn 2004 funding was granted by Advantage West Midlands to build a new 'Eco-Park' on the outskirts of the town on the east side of the A49 bypass, at the Sheet Road roundabout, with space for traditional handcraft businesses, new environmentally friendly office buildings and a park &amp; ride facility. More construction work began in 2006 on the west side of the roundabout on a much-debated pasture land on the town's fringe known as the Foldgate. The land has now been turned over to commercial use with a filling station, Travelodge hotel and chain pub/restaurant, opened in late 2008.\nGeography.\nThe medieval settlement is largely on the top of a hill, with the castle, market place and parish church (St Laurence's) situated along the flat land on this hilltop, which has a maximum elevation of at the castle, falling only gradually towards the east, with an elevation of at the Buttercross.\nThe streets then run down to the Rivers Teme and Corve (their confluence being to the northwest of the centre of Ludlow) to the north and south. The surface of the Teme has an approximate elevation of as it passes Ludford Bridge.\nIn the western part of the historic core, Dinham retains the character of a village, though dominated by the castle, with a road leading steeply down from Castle Square to the Teme and then over Dinham Bridge (an early 19th century replacement of an older bridge very slightly downstream). The old chapel in Dinham, a Grade II* listed building, though no longer used for worship, features the oldest built structure in Ludlow outside the castle. To the east a rolling landscape exists, and it is in this direction that the town has steadily grown. East Hamlet was the name of the settlement to the east of the town.\nThe growth of the town in this eastwards (and to the north-east) direction continues to the present day, with little or no development especially to the south or west, to an extent that the traditional town centre (the medieval town) is actually in the southwest corner of the entire settlement. It has also meant that the village of Ludford, immediately on the other side of the Teme at Ludford Bridge (itself at the foot of Lower Broad Street), remains a distinct community.\nLocalities in the town's suburbs include Gallows Bank and Sandpits. Immediately beyond the A49 by-pass are Rocks Green and the Sheet, and it is in these two places that much of the present development and growth of the town is taking place, including a Sainsbury's supermarket at Rocks Green. They are both approximately from the town centre.\nAccolades.\nThe town has regularly been held in high esteem by academics and commentators in the areas of urbanism and architecture. Ludlow was winner of \"The Great Town Award\" (UK &amp; Ireland) from The Academy of Urbanism in 2007. The first episode of the BBC television series \"Town\", in which geographer Nicholas Crane examines the great towns of the United Kingdom, focused solely on Ludlow for the hour-long documentary. Ludlow also was one of the \"Six English Towns\", a 1977 television programme by architectural historian Alec Clifton-Taylor.\nThe historic centre of Ludlow has largely escaped development that would otherwise alter its medieval, Tudor and Georgian character. Furthermore, the lack of development to the south and west allows for the town's historic setting (and particularly that of the castle) by the Teme and the neighbouring countryside to be readily appreciated in the modern day. M.R.G. Conzen remarked of Ludlow \"Its composite medieval town plan and a history of eight and a half centuries with several periods of considerable importance have endowed its Old Town with an historically well-stratified and richly textured landscape.\" Michael Raven, who created a detailed gazetteer of all the settlements of Herefordshire and Shropshire in the late 20th century, stated that \"There can be little doubt that Ludlow is the finest town in Shropshire.\"\nThe medieval street plan remains, though the town walls and gates have disappeared in many places. Mill Street and Broad Street, leading down from the very centre to the Teme in the south, are particularly famous for their rich architectural heritage and vistas, with many fine Georgian buildings. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner described Broad Street as \"one of the most memorable streets in England\".\nPopulation.\nThe 2011 UK census recorded 10,266 people living in Ludlow's civil parish. A further 673 live in the neighbouring Ludford parish to the south, meaning the population for the town and adjoining settlements is approximately 11,000. The 2021 Census showed a population of 10,039 in Ludlow parish and still 673 in Ludford parish, giving a total of 10,712, plus about a further 1,000 in neighbouring parishes within the three county wards of Ludlow East, North and South.\nHistorical.\nIn 1377, poll tax was levied against 1,172 of the parish's residents. By this measure, Ludlow was the 35th most populous town in England.\nTransport.\nRailways.\nLudlow railway station began serving the town in 1852 and is about five minutes' walk from the town centre. It is on the Welsh Marches Line and is served by trains between Manchester Piccadilly, Crewe, Shrewsbury, Hereford, Abergavenny, Cardiff Central and Swansea; these are operated by Transport for Wales.\nThere is a short tunnel to the south of the station, which runs under Gravel Hill. Clee Hill Junction existed just to the north of the station, with a goods line leading off the main line up to the quarries on Titterstone Clee Hill.\nBuses.\nBus services in the area are operated by Diamond Bus, Lugg Valley Travel and Minsterley Motors. Routes link the town with Church Stretton, Kidderminster and Shrewsbury; there is also a park and ride service, on a circular route.\nRoads.\nOn 4 February 1980, the \u00a34.7 million single-carriageway by-pass road was officially opened by Kenneth Clarke. The by-pass had been built to the east of Ludlow in the late 1970s, opening to traffic in the summer of 1979, and diverts the A49 trunk road around the town. The former route of the A49 through the town was reclassified as the B4361.\nThe town centre retains its medieval streets and has had long-running problems with motor traffic and car parking, which is now restricted seven days a week. There is a town centre residents' parking permit scheme in operation. Council-owned car parks exist in a number of locations in Ludlow to cater for much of the long-stay car parking. The Eco-Park situated on the eastern outskirts of the town, at the Sheet and adjacent to the A49.\nThe A4117 begins at the Rocks Green roundabout on the Ludlow by-pass and runs across the Clee Hills to Cleobury Mortimer; it then continues via the A456 onwards to Bewdley and Kidderminster.\nTwo historic bridges cross the River Teme at Ludlow: Ludford Bridge (a Scheduled Ancient Monument) and Dinham Bridge (early 19th century, Grade II listed); both of which still take vehicular traffic as no modern bridges have been built over the Teme in the area. To the north of the town centre, the historic Corve Bridge crosses the River Corve and this bridge was relieved by Burway Bridge in the mid-20th century. However, on 26 June 2007, dramatic flooding on the Corve caused the Burway Bridge to collapse, severing a gas main and causing 20 homes in nearby Corve Street to be evacuated. The old stone bridge has now been replaced with a modern steel and pre-fabricated concrete construction.\nCycling.\nNational Cycle Network route 44 runs over Dinham and Ludford Bridges (via Camp and Silkmill Lanes in-between) en route from Bromfield to Pipe Aston. It is known as the \"Six Castles Cycleway\", with Ludlow Castle as one of the six.\nWalking.\nThe Mortimer Trail, a long-distance footpath, runs from Ludlow to Kington, Herefordshire.\nCulture.\nFestivals and fairs.\nThe now-defunct Ludlow Festival was held annually from 1960, during June and July each year. An open area within the castle served as the stage and backdrop for various Shakespearean plays, while a number of supporting events at various venues included classical and pop/rock concerts, varied musicians, lecture talks from public figures, and entertainers. The 54-year-old Festival which had been \"loss-making\" collapsed in 2014 due to \"financial troubles\". Organisers said it was \"simply not commercially viable\".\nThe Medieval Christmas Fayre continued to take place until 2019, the Covid 19 pandemic meant that the 2020 and 2021 Fayres couldn\u2019t go ahead. It was set up for 2022 but a storm caused damage the night before and meant it was cancelled at last minute. The financial impact meant that the festival organisers folded.\nThe Medieval Christmas Fayre was replaced by the Ludlow Winter festival in 2023 and is due to take place again in November 2024 \nGastronomy.\nLudlow was for a time a gastronomic centre, at one point the only town in England with three Michelin-starred restaurants. The town had boasted eight AA Rosette starred restaurants, and three Michelin-starred establishments. In 2016, Ludlow lost its last Michelin-starred establishment \u2014 \"Mr Underhills\" \u2014 which had featured in the \"Sunday Times\" \"Top 100 Restaurants\". Another previously starred establishment in Ludlow was \"La B\u00e9casse\" which went into liquidation for the second time in 2014.\nThe town hosts the annual Ludlow food festival. Ludlow was the first UK member of Cittaslow or \"slow food\" movement, but after ongoing controversy over public funding, the town is no longer a member. As of 2021, the town has three butchers (one located in the suburbs), four bakers, a regular farmers market and a range of specialist food shops. The town has a brewery which has been producing real ale (using local hops) since 2006; it is in a renovated goods shed near the railway station.\nThe annual Ludlow Marches Festival of Food &amp; Drink is a trade fair that takes place in and around Ludlow in September. Centred on Ludlow Castle, where over 150 local, small food producers showcase and sell their wares, the three-day event involves the town centre in food and drink trails including a \"Sausage Trail\".\nArts.\nThe town is home to an arts and cinema centre, The Ludlow Assembly Rooms, that hosts live and streamed music, theatre, stand-up comedy and talks. It acts as an arts community centre, has a visual arts gallery, and on most evenings, shows a film, from a wide variety of genres (including classic, arthouse, and blockbuster). Ludlow is now also home to the Rooftop Theatre Company. Originally from the South East, they have been delivering contemporary-styled Shakespeare since 2003. Their first Ludlow production was The Comedy of Errors in 2014.\nLudlow has featured in movies and TV programmes including Tom Sharpe's \"Blott on the Landscape\" and 90s TV adaptations of \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" and \"Moll Flanders\". In Shakespeare's \"Richard III\", Ludlow is mentioned, as the place where the young Edward V is to be fetched as Richard III plots to seize the crown. The town is described as the capital of Wales following a zombie apocalypse in the novel World War Z.\nLudlow has connections with a number of figures in the arts \u2013 including Alfred Edward Housman, poet and author of \"A Shropshire Lad\" (his ashes were buried in the graveyard of St Laurence's Church and were marked by a cherry tree). Stanley J. Weyman, the novelist known as the \"Prince of Romance\", was born in Ludlow, as was sculptor Adrian Jones, whose ashes are buried in the same churchyard. The naval historian and novelist Captain Geoffrey Bennett (Sea Lion) lived in Ludlow after his retirement in 1974 up to his death in 1983 and his ashes, too, were interred in the parish churchyard.\nSport.\nThe town had a football team (AFC Ludlow), which competed in the West Midlands (Regional) League Division One. The club could no longer field a full team, and folded in June 2016. Ludlow's rugby union club have their ground situated just off Linney near the castle, competing in the Midland league. There is a cricket club sporting its 1st and 2nd XI teams in the Shropshire Premier Cricket League and its 3rd and 4th XI in the Shropshire Cricket League Division 5 and Division 6 respectively. The cricket ground is near the junction of Burway Lane and Bromfield Road in the north of the town and has a picturesque setting with the castle, St Laurence's church and surrounding hills and countryside clearly visible.\nLudlow Racecourse and Ludlow Golf Club are situated together just off the A49 road northwest of the town centre, at a place called Old Field near Bromfield. A smaller (9-hole) golf course exists at Elm Lodge, just off Fishmore Road on the northern edge of the town.\nA privately run leisure and fitness centre, which includes a swimming pool, is on Bromfield Road on the northern edge of the town (near the secondary school). Lawn bowls is played in the area, with several teams from Ludlow's two bowling clubs (Burway and Ludlow Castle) playing against each other and teams from further afield, in the Ludlow &amp; District Bowls League, as well as in the higher Shropshire leagues. There is an amateur boxing club, situated on Wheeler Road, with its new clubhouse opening in 2014.\nMedia.\nNewspapers.\nThe \"Ludlow Advertiser\" was founded in 1855 by John Crosse, with its original offices at 18 King Street. New premises for the Advertiser were constructed in 1914 on Upper Galdeford, still called the Advertiser Buildings, but now a fast-food outlet. It has published an edition weekly ever since, though is now the \"Ludlow and Tenbury Wells Advertiser\" and published from the \"Hereford Times\" offices in Hereford.\nThe current free paper is the \"Teme Valley Times\", founded in 2006.\nIn 2010 the \"Ludlow Journal\", a free weekly newspaper, ceased publication and was absorbed into its paid-for sister, the \"South Shropshire Journal\". \nThe \"Shropshire Star\" \u2013 with its related publication the \"South Shropshire Journal\" \u2013 is published in Ketley and had an office in Ludlow, at The Angel on Broad Street, but this closed in 2017.\nThe magazine publisher Newsfield was based in Ludlow.\nTelevision.\nRegional TV news is provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Ridge Hill and the local relay transmitters.\nRadio stations.\nSunshine Radio, once a pirate radio station, is now a legitimate commercial broadcaster in the south Shropshire and north Herefordshire/Worcestershire. Other radio stations include its sister station in Hereford, and BBC Radio Shropshire.\nBBC Hereford and Worcester's 1584 AM and Sunshine Radio's 105.9 FM broadcasts are made from the Woofferton transmitting station, just south of Ludlow, which is notable for its Cold War history and now being the UK's only remaining shortwave broadcasting site.\nGovernance.\nCivic.\nLudlow is a civil parish with a town council and a mayor. Ludlow was a borough from 1461 to 1974 (becoming a municipal borough in 1835 and a rural borough in 1967); the borough encompassed the same area as Ludlow's parish until the mid-late 19th century. Its borough status meant Ludlow was largely autonomous from the hundred of Munslow which it lay in.\nWider local government was provided by Ludlow Rural District from 1894 (this rural district absorbed the borough of Ludlow in 1967, causing the change in status to a rural borough) until 1974 when South Shropshire District Council (with Ludlow as its seat) took over along with Shropshire County Council in a two-tier arrangement. Rural boroughs were abolished in 1974 and Ludlow's borough status at that point ended. The district councils of Shropshire were abolished in 2009 and the county now has a unitary authority called Shropshire Council, based in Shrewsbury. The South Shropshire District Council's offices at Stone House on Corve Street were gradually emptied of local government staff until their sale in 2014.\nThe town council is based at Ludlow Guildhall on Mill Street, a grade I listed building, which was the home of the town's county and magistrates' courts until their closure in 2011. There was a Town Hall, situated in the Square, which was built in 1887\u20131888 and demolished in March 1986; it featured prominently just prior to its demolition in the 1985 television drama \"Blott on the Landscape\". The other notable civic building in the centre of town is the Buttercross (named as it was the butter market at the site of the medieval High Cross); it was the home of the town council after the demolition of the Town Hall and prior to the closure of the courts. It is now an 'interpretation centre' for the town's architectural heritage.\nElectoral arrangements.\nThe boundaries of Ludlow's wards and electoral divisions were most recently reviewed in 2008.\nFifteen councillors sit on the town council, representing seven wards, and elections (when contested) are held every four years (at the same time as elections to Shropshire Council). The seven wards changed slightly in 2008, retaining their previous names and number of councillors they each return \u2013 they are (with the number of town councillors returned given): Rockspring (2), Hayton (2), Bringewood (2), Corve (2), Whitcliffe (2), Gallows Bank (3), and Clee View (2).\nLudlow together with nearby parishes comprise three electoral divisions, each returning one councillor to Shropshire Council in elections held every four years, the most recent being in 2021. The electoral divisions comprise:\nCivil parishes.\nLudford is a separate civil parish, with its own parish council, and covers the adjoining places of Ludford, Foldgate, Steventon, the Sheet and Rocks Green. Until 1901 an area of land at the foot of Old Street, called Holdgate Fee, was a detached part of Ludford parish in the town itself. Ludlow Castle was a parish of its own, contained within the castle's walls and the immediate hillside; it was abolished in 1901 and ceded to Ludlow's civil parish. Other than Ludford, the only other civil parish in the present-day that neighbours Ludlow is Bromfield.\nThe civil parish of East Hamlet, created in 1884 covered a limited area to the east of the town; this parish was largely absorbed by Ludlow's parish as the town expanded into it (in 1901, 1934 and finally in 1987 when it was abolished). Ludlow's parish in 1901 expanded into Ludford to the east (taking in Holdgate Fee and the Steventon New Road area); another two expansions into Ludford in 1934 involved taking in the Whitcliffe (which had been acquired by the burgesses of Ludlow already in the 13th century) and a further part to the east (the Gallows Bank area). 1934 also saw a significant expansion of the Ludlow parish west into Bromfield's parish, on both sides of the Teme; this coupled with the inclusion of Whitcliffe constitutes the western, essentially rural part to Ludlow's civil parish in the present day.\nParliament.\nFor representation to the House of Commons, Ludlow falls within the South Shropshire constituency, which has its origins in the Ludlow parliamentary borough constituency created in 1473, and which until 1868 returned two burgesses to Parliament.\nIn modern times, the Ludlow constituency came to cover a large area of southern Shropshire including Bridgnorth and after constituency boundary changes was redesignated South Shropshire ahead of the 2024 general election when the current member, Stuart Anderson of the Conservative Party, was elected.\nEconomy.\nMcConnel Limited, a manufacturer of hedge cutting and verge mowing machinery, is based in Ludlow, occupying a seven-acre industrial site in the Temeside/Weeping Cross area of the town known as the Temeside Works. The company claims to be the innovator of the first tractor-mounted hedge cutting machine (produced in 1945) and a leading producer of reach flail mower hedge and verge mowing power-arm technology.\nMarket.\nThe town has regular outdoor markets held on Castle Square, an area that was enlarged in 1986 with the demolition of the Town Hall (which was also known as Market Hall). General markets are held on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Specialist markets (examples being crafts, antiques, local produce) are held on occasional Thursdays and Sundays. They are run by the town council.\nEducation.\nLudlow has two primary schools for children aged 5\u201311 and a secondary school \u2013 the Ludlow Church of England School \u2014 for pupils aged 11\u201316.\nLudlow College is a sixth form college in the town centre, formed by the merger of the town's boys grammar school and girls high school. Prior to its merger with Herefordshire College in 2012 it was one of the oldest educational institutions in the country, dating back some 800 years.\nHealth.\nLudlow Hospital is an NHS community hospital at the junction of Gravel Hill and New Road. It had until recently several inpatient and outpatient departments and wards, as well as a minor injuries unit.\nThere are two doctors' surgeries in the town, both just off Upper Galdeford.\nEmergency services.\nThe Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service have a fire station on Weeping Cross Lane, staffed by retained firefighters.\nWest Mercia Police have a police station on Lower Galdeford. Its front counter closed in 2015.\nVoluntary aid society, the British Red Cross, has a hall in the Smithfield car park, just off Lower Galdeford, and adjacent to the fire station.\nReligion.\nThere are two Church of England parishes in Ludlow and two Church of England churches \u2013 the large and historic St Laurence's Church in the centre of the town \u2013 and the 19th century St John's Church on Gravel Hill. Within St Laurence's Church are the St John's, Lady and St Catherine's chapels. Ludford has its own Church of England parish and church, dedicated to St Giles.\nLudlow falls within the Church of England's Diocese of Hereford and between 1981 and 2020 was a suffragan see with its own suffragan bishop, the Bishop of Ludlow, the only such bishop in the diocese. There has long been an Archdeacon of Ludlow, historically known as the Archdeacon of Shropshire, overseeing the other parishes in the southern part of the county (the part of the Hereford diocese that is within Shropshire).\nThe Roman Catholic church of St Peter is on Henley Road. Construction to a design by the Welsh-based Italian architect Giuseppe Rinvolucri began in 1935, using stone from nearby Farlow and building in a neo-Byzantine and plain Romanesque style. The construction also involved novel reinforced concrete technology. The Byzantine design continues inside, with a blue dome with twelve gold-leaf stars representing St Peter and the other Apostles. An Art Deco presbytery was built next to the church. St Peter's chapel, within the castle, is now a ruin.\nLudlow has a Methodist church on Broad Street, a Quaker Meeting House on St Mary's Lane, a Baptist church at the Rockspring Community Centre, and an Elim Pentecostal church off the Smithfield car park.\nTwo monastic institutions once existed in Ludlow \u2013 one Augustinian (\"Austin\") Friars on the corner of Lower Galdeford and Weeping Cross Lane, and the other Carmelite (\"White\") Friars between Linney and Corve Street. Both were dissolved in 1538. The White Friars site became the town's cemetery in 1824, with a new church constructed, dedicated to St Leonard (a St Leonard's chapel existed on the corner of Corve Street and Linney in medieval times). The St Leonard's graveyard and church still exist but are no longer used for burials or worship (instead the church building is now a commercial premises). The Austin Friars site became the town's livestock market (the Smithfield) and is now a public car park.\nLandmarks.\nThe following are the principal landmark buildings and structures in the town, the majority of which are grade I or II* listed buildings.\nTwinning.\nLudlow has three twinning arrangements.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "59006", "revid": "89336", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59006", "title": "Number sign", "text": "Typographic symbol (#)The symbol # is known as the number sign, hash, or (in North America) the pound sign. The symbol has historically been used for a wide range of purposes including the designation of an ordinal number and as a ligatured abbreviation for pounds avoirdupois \u2013 having been derived from the now-rare \u2114.\nSince 2007, widespread usage of the symbol to introduce metadata tags on social media platforms has led to such tags being known as \"hashtags\", and from that, the symbol itself is sometimes incorrectly called a hashtag.\nThe symbol is distinguished from similar symbols by its combination of level horizontal strokes and right-tilting vertical strokes.\nHistory.\nIt is believed that the symbol traces its origins to the symbol \u27e8\u2114\u27e9, an abbreviation of the Roman term \"libra pondo\", which translates as \"pound weight\". The abbreviation \"lb\" was printed as a dedicated ligature including a horizontal line across (which indicated abbreviation). Ultimately, the symbol was reduced for clarity as an overlay of two horizontal strokes \"=\" across two slash-like strokes \"//\". \nThe symbol is described as the \"number\" character in an 1853 treatise on bookkeeping, and its double meaning is described in a bookkeeping text from 1880. The instruction manual of the Blickensderfer model 5 typewriter (c.\u20091896) appears to refer to the symbol as the \"number mark\". Some early-20th-century U.S. sources refer to it as the \"number sign\", although this could also refer to the numero sign (\u2116). A 1917 manual distinguishes between two uses of the sign: \"number (written before a figure)\" and \"pounds (written after a figure)\". The use of the phrase \"pound sign\" to refer to this symbol is found from 1932 in U.S. usage. The term \"hash sign\" is found in South African writings from the late 1960s.\nFor mechanical devices, the symbol appeared on the keyboard of the Remington Standard typewriter (c.\u20091886). It appeared in many of the early teleprinter codes and from there was copied to ASCII, which made it available on computers and thus caused many more uses to be found for the character. The symbol was introduced on the bottom right button of touch-tone keypads in 1968, but that button was not extensively used until the advent of large-scale voicemail (PBX systems, etc.) in the early 1980s.\nOne of the uses in computers was to label the following text as having a different interpretation (such as a command or a comment) from the rest of the text. It was adopted for use within internet relay chat (IRC) networks circa 1988 to label groups and topics. This usage inspired Chris Messina to propose a similar system to be used on Twitter to tag topics of interest on the microblogging network; this became known as a hashtag. Although used initially and most popularly on Twitter, hashtag use has extended to other social media sites.\nNames.\nNumber sign\n\"Number sign\" is the name chosen by the Unicode Consortium. Most common in Canada and the northeastern United States. American telephone equipment companies which serve Canadian callers often have an option in their programming to denote Canadian English, which in turn instructs the system to say \"number sign\" to callers instead of \"pound\". This name is rarely used elsewhere in the world, where numbers are normally represented by the letters \"No.\".\nPound sign or pound\nIn the United States and Canada, the \"#\" key on a phone is commonly referred to as the pound sign, \"pound key\", or simply \"pound\". Dialing instructions to an extension such as #77, for example, can be read as \"pound seven seven\". This name is rarely used elsewhere, as the term \"pound sign\" is understood to mean the currency symbol \u00a3.\nHash, hash mark, hashmark\nIn the United Kingdom, Australia, and some other countries, it is frequently called a \"hash\" (probably from \"hatch\", referring to cross-hatching).\nProgrammers also use this term; for instance is \"hash, bang\" or \"shebang\".\nHashtag\nDerived from the previous, the word \"hashtag\" is often used when reading social media messages aloud, indicating the start of a hashtag. For instance, the text \"#foo\" is often read out loud as \"hashtag foo\" (as opposed to \"hash foo\"). This leads to the common belief that the symbol itself is called \"hashtag\". Twitter documentation refers to it as \"the hashtag symbol\".\nHex\n\"Hex\" is commonly used in Singapore and Malaysia, as spoken by many recorded telephone directory-assistance menus: \"Please enter your phone number followed by the 'hex' key\". The term \"hex\" is discouraged in Singapore in favour of \"hash\". In Singapore, a hash is also called \"hex\" in apartment addresses, where it precedes the floor number.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Visible anchor/styles.css\" /&gt;Octothorp, octothorpe, octathorp, octatherp\nMost scholars believe the word was invented by workers at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by 1968, who needed a word for the symbol on the telephone keypad. Don MacPherson is said to have created the word by combining \"octo\" and the last name of Jim Thorpe, an Olympic medalist. Howard Eby and Lauren Asplund claim to have invented the word as a joke in 1964, combining \"octo\" with the syllable \"therp\" which, because of the \"th\" digraph, was hard to pronounce in different languages. \"The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories\", 1991, has a long article that is consistent with Doug Kerr's essay, which says \"octotherp\" was the original spelling, and that the word arose in the 1960s among telephone engineers as a joke. Other hypotheses for the origin of the word include the last name of James Oglethorpe or using the Old English word for village, \"thorp\", because the symbol looks like a village surrounded by eight fields. The word was popularized within and outside Bell Labs. The first appearance of \"octothorp\" in a US patent is in a 1973 filing. This patent also refers to the six-pointed asterisk (\u273b) used on telephone buttons as a \"sextile\".\nSharp\n Use of the name \"sharp\" is due to the symbol's resemblance to . The same derivation is seen in the name of the Microsoft programming languages C#, J# and F#. Microsoft says that the name \"C#\" is pronounced 'see sharp'.\" According to the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification, the name of the language is written \"C#\" (\" (U+0043) followed by the # (U+0023)\") and pronounced \"C Sharp\".\nSquare\nOn telephones, the International Telecommunication Union specification ITU-T E.161 3.2.2 states: \"The symbol may be referred to as the square or the most commonly used equivalent term in other languages.\" Formally, this is not a number sign but rather another character, . The real or virtual keypads on almost all modern telephones use the simple instead, as does most documentation.\nUsage.\nWhen \u27e8#\u27e9 prefixes a number, it is read as \"number\". \"A #2 pencil\", for example, indicates \"a number-two pencil\". This usage is rare in print, or outside North America. Instead the abbreviation 'No.' or the symbol '\u2116' or just \"number\" is used.\nWhen \u27e8#\u27e9 is \"after\" a number, it is read as \"pound\" or \"pounds\", meaning the unit of weight. The text \"5# bag of flour\" would mean \"five-pound bag of flour\". This is rare outside North America.\nUnicode.\nThe number sign was assigned code 35 (hex 0x23) in ASCII where it was inherited by many character sets. In EBCDIC it is often at 0x7B or 0xEC.\nUnicode characters with \"number sign\" in their names:\nAdditionally, a Unicode named sequence is defined for the grapheme cluster (#\ufe0f\u20e3).\nOn keyboards.\nOn the standard US keyboard layout, the # symbol is . On standard UK and some other European keyboards, the same keystrokes produce the pound (sterling) sign, \u00a3 symbol, and may be moved to a separate key above the right shift key.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The college law society at Corpus, the Nicholas Bacon Law Society, founded in 1972, is named after him.\nThere is a story that he evaded ordination by going into hiding \"with the help of a rich uncle\", and he seems to have entered an Inn of Chancery before being admitted to Gray's Inn five years later after a period in Paris; he was called to the Bar in 1533.\nFollowing the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Henry VIII gave him a grant of the manors of Redgrave, Botesdale and Gislingham in Suffolk, and Gorhambury, Hertfordshire. Gorhambury belonged to St Albans Abbey and lay near the site of the vanished Roman city of Verulamium (modern day St Albans). From 1563 to 1568 he built a new house, Old Gorhambury House (now a ruin), which later became the property of Francis Bacon, his youngest son, who also built a nearby property, Verulam House, to his own designs.\nIn 1545 he became a Member of Parliament, representing Dartmouth. The following year, he was made Attorney of the Court of Wards and Liveries, a prestigious and lucrative post, and by 1552 he had risen to become treasurer of Gray's Inn.\nAs a Protestant, he lost preferment under Queen Mary I of England. However, on the accession of her younger sister Elizabeth in 1558, he was appointed Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, largely owing to the influence of his brother-in-law William Cecil. Shortly afterwards, Bacon was knighted.\nBacon helped secure the position of Archbishop of Canterbury for his friend Matthew Parker, and in his official capacity presided over the House of Lords when Elizabeth opened her first parliament. Though an implacable enemy of Mary, Queen of Scots, he opposed Cecil's policy of war against France, on financial grounds; but he favoured closer links with foreign Protestants, and was aware of the threat to England from the alliance between France and Scotland. In 1559 he was authorized to exercise the full jurisdiction of Lord Chancellor. In 1564 he fell temporarily into the royal disfavour and was dismissed from court, because Elizabeth suspected he was concerned in the publication of a pamphlet, \"A Declaration of the Succession of the Crowne Imperial of Ingland,\" by John Hales, which favoured the claim of Lady Katherine Grey (sister of Lady Jane Grey) to the English throne.\nBacon's innocence having been admitted, he was restored to favour, and replied to a writing by Sir Anthony Browne, who had again asserted the rights of the House of Suffolk, to which Lady Katherine belonged. He thoroughly distrusted Mary, Queen of Scots; objected to the proposal to marry her to Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk; and warned Elizabeth that serious consequences for England would follow her restoration. He seems to have disliked the proposed marriage between the English queen and Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou, and his distrust of the Roman Catholics and the French was increased by the St Bartholomew's Day massacre. As a loyal English churchman he was ceaselessly interested in ecclesiastical matters, and made suggestions for the better observation of doctrine and discipline in the church.\nDeath and legacy.\nHe died in London and was buried in Old St Paul's Cathedral; there were many tributes to him. His grave and monument were destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. A modern monument in the crypt lists his as one of the important graves lost.\nHe had been an eloquent speaker, a learned lawyer, a generous friend; and his interest in education led him to make several gifts and bequests for educational purposes, including the foundation of a free grammar school at Redgrave in Suffolk.\nMarriages and issue.\nNicholas Bacon's first marriage was to Jane Ferneley (d.1552). Nicholas and Jane had six surviving children, three sons and three daughters:\nSir Nicholas Bacon's second marriage, in 1553, was to Anne Cooke (1528\u20131610), one of the daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, by whom he had two sons:\nJane's widowed younger sister, Anne Ferneley (d.1596), married secondly in 1544 to Sir Thomas Gresham.[]\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "59019", "revid": "698799", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=59019", "title": "Jug band", "text": "Band employing a jug player\nA jug band is a band employing a jug player and a mix of conventional and homemade instruments. These homemade instruments are ordinary objects adapted to or modified for making sound, like the washtub bass, washboard, spoons, bones, stovepipe, jew's harp, and comb and tissue paper. The term 'jug band' is loosely used in referring to ensembles that also incorporate homemade instruments, but those are more accurately referred to as skiffle bands, spasm bands, or juke (or jook) bands (see juke joint) because they do not include a jug player.\nHistory.\nEarly jug bands were typically made up of African-American vaudeville and medicine show musicians. Beginning in the urban South (namely, Louisville, Kentucky, and Memphis, Tennessee), they played a mixture of blues, ragtime, and jazz. The history of jug bands is related to the development of the blues. The informal and energetic music of the jug bands also contributed to the development of rock and roll.\nThe jug sound is made by taking a jug (usually made of glass or stoneware) and buzzing the lips into its mouth from about an inch away. As with brass instruments, changes in pitch are controlled by altering lip tension, and an accomplished jug player could have a two-octave range. The stovepipe (usually a section of tin pipe, three or four inches in diameter) is played in much the same manner, with the pipe rather than the jug serving as the resonating chamber. There is some similarity to the didgeridoo, but there is no contact between the stovepipe and the player's lips. Some jug and stovepipe players utilize throat vocalization along with lip buzzing, as with the didgeridoo.\nThe swooping sounds of the jug fill a musical role halfway between the trombone and sousaphone or tuba in Dixieland bands, playing mid- and lower-range harmonies in rhythm.\nIn the early days of jug band music, homemade guitars and mandolins were sometimes made from the necks of discarded manufactured guitars fastened to large gourds that were flattened on one side, with a sound-hole cut into the flat side, before drying. Banjos were sometimes made from a discarded guitar neck and a metal pie plate.\nOriginal bands.\nJug bands from Louisville, Kentucky, were the first to record. The violinist Clifford Hayes's Old Southern Jug Band recorded as early as 1923. Whistler &amp; His Jug Band, often making use of a nose whistle, first recorded in September 1924 for Gennett Records. Earl McDonald's Original Louisville Jug Band and Dixieland Jug Blowers were also among the first to record. The vaudeville-blues singer Sara Martin and \"The Blue Yodeler\", Jimmie Rodgers, both employed these bands for their recordings. Louisville bands often used whiskey jugs and were more jazz-oriented, a melding of string band and ragtime influences. Jug bands made street performances, played at parties, and began entertaining on riverboats on the Ohio River around 1900 and first appeared at the Kentucky Derby in 1903.\nJug bands from the Memphis area were more firmly rooted in country blues, hokum, and earlier African-American music traditions. Will Shade's Memphis Jug Band and Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers recorded for Ralph Peer, starting in 1927, many great songs that became the basis for the later jug band revival, including \"Stealin',\" \"Jug Band Music,\" \"On the Road Again,\" \"Whoa, Mule,\" \"Minglewood Blues,\" and \"Walk Right In\". Many songs had \"blues\" in the title, including \"Coal Oil Blues\" and \"Lumpy Man Blues,\" but were not traditional 12-bar blues.\nThe Memphis Jug Band and Gus Cannon's Jug Stompers featured harmonica played by Will Shade and Noah Lewis, respectively. Other bands from the Memphis area were Jack Kelly and His South Memphis Jug Band, Jed Davenport and Dewey Corley's Beale Street Jug Band, and Noah Lewis's Jug Band. Ma Rainey's tub-jug band featured the first recordings of the slide guitarist Tampa Red, who later formed his own Hokum Jug Band. Big Bill Broonzy and Memphis Minnie cut a few sides each backed up by their own jug bands; Memphis Minnie also sang and played with the Memphis Jug Band. Memphis jug band music is closely associated with Memphis blues.\nThe Cincinnati Jug Band recorded for Paramount Records in 1929, with Stovepipe No. 1 on the stovepipe.\nThe Seven Gallon Jug Band, including Clarence Williams on jug and Willie \"The Lion\" Smith on piano, recorded for Columbia Records in 1929.\nThe Birmingham Jug Band, including Jaybird Coleman and Big Joe Williams, and King David's Jug Band recorded for Okeh Records in 1930 in Atlanta, Georgia.\nDaddy Stovepipe and Mississippi Sarah recorded for Vocalion Records in 1931.\nThe 1930s depression and the devastating effect of radio on record sales reduced the output of jug band music to a trickle. The last sides by Cannon and the Memphis Jug Band were made in 1930 and 1934, respectively. Cannon and Will Shade were recorded again in 1956 by Sam Charters on a field trip for Folkways Records. The sound of the washboard and tub bass, however, lasted well into the 1940s as an integral part of the \"Bluebird beat\" in Chicago. Bukka White's \"Fixin' to Die\", recorded in Chicago in 1940, is driven by a syncopated washboard backup.\nRevival.\nOne of the first recordings of the folk era jug band revival was by the Orange Blossom Jug Five, \"Skiffle in Stereo\", made in 1958 for the poorly-distributed Lyrichord label. It was also the first recording by the New York folk singer Dave Van Ronk and featured Sam Charters, author of \"The Country Blues\", his wife Ann, as well as Len Kunstadt, co-owner of the Spivey Records label. Van Ronk would revisit the genre in 1964 with the album \"Dave Van Ronk and the Ragtime Jug Stompers\", though his ragtime guitar picking and repertoire influenced many subsequent jug bands. Another early recording group was Jolly Joe's Jug Band, led by the record collector Joe Bussard, and released on his own Fonotone label as 78 rpm records. Eventually these were collected on LP by Piedmont Records.\nGus Cannon's \"Walk Right In\" was a number 1 hit for the Rooftop Singers in 1963, the only time a jug band song topped the charts. These one-hit wonders even made an appearance at that year's Newport Folk Festival before fading into obscurity. The song's success brought Cannon himself back into the Stax Records studios in Memphis for his last recordings that same year at age 79. The album, \"Walk Right In\", features Cannon on banjo and his old friends Will Shade on jug and Milton Roby on washboard. The album consists of 13 of his old hits, with Cannon interjecting comments and telling stories about the songs. Also in 1963, Starday Records released \"The Original Talking Blues Man\", by Robert Lunn with Jug &amp; Washboard Band.\nThis brief flurry of interest in the genre sparked the formation of a few jug bands that reached national prominence. The Jim Kweskin Jug Band of Cambridge, Massachusetts, which recorded for Vanguard Records, featured the washtub bass and jug player Fritz Richmond, who later played jug on Warren Zevon's \"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead.\" The New York-based Even Dozen Jug Band was Elektra Records' answer to the Kweskin band and featured, among others, Maria D'Amato, Joshua Rifkin, David Grisman, Stefan Grossman, John Sebastian, and Steve Katz. Maria D'Amato then joined the Jim Kweskin Jug Band, later marrying the guitarist Geoff Muldaur. Artie Traum also formed a jug band at this time, called \"The True Endeavor Jug Band\". The 13th Floor Elevators, a band from Austin, Texas, formed as an electric jug band, featuring Tommy Hall as electric jug player. A similar revival began in the UK in the 1960s, possibly as an offshoot of the revival in the United States. A number of jug bands appeared there in the late 1960s in addition to the skiffle bands, including the Anglo-American Filharmonious Jug Band.\nThe musicians playing in jug music revival groups went on to form other bands. John Sebastian founded the pop music group the Lovin' Spoonful and later continued as a successful solo artist. Country Joe and the Fish came from the Instant Action Jug Band. Mungo Jerry, which evolved from an earlier blues group, Good Earth, was in effect a jug band on their first live performances and recordings, thanks to their use of jug (played by the group's banjo player, Paul King, who left in 1972), and washboard, contributed by regular \"extra member\" Joe Rush. Jesse Colin Young moved to the West Coast and formed the Youngbloods, whose first hit was \"Grizzly Bear,\" a jug band standard. Another group with jug band roots was the Grateful Dead. Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir, and Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan were in Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions before forming the Warlocks, which evolved into the Grateful Dead. A self-titled CD of Mother McCree's jug band music recorded in 1964 was released in 1999. Maria Muldaur, Geoff Muldaur, David Grisman, and Stefan Grossman all continued with successful solo careers. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band also started as a jug band.\nPop-rock tributes to jug band music include \"Willy and the Poor Boys\", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, and \"Jug Band Music\" by the Lovin' Spoonful. The Spoonful also mined the old songs. In addition to doing versions of songs from the classic jug band repertoire on their first album, \"Do You Believe in Magic\" (1965), such as \"Blues in the Bottle,\" \"Sportin' Life,\" \"My Gal,\" \"Fishin' Blues,\" and \"Wild About My Lovin',\" Sebastian's \"Younger Girl\" used the melody of Gus Cannon's \"Prison Wall Blues.\" Indeed, the song \"Do You Believe in Magic,\" a Top Ten hit, mentioned the genre in its lyrics: \"If you believe in magic, don't bother to choose / If it's jug band music or rhythm and blues / Just go and listen, it'll start with a smile / That won't wipe off your face no matter how hard you try.\" That instantaneous joy many have felt upon first listening to jug band music contributes to its fans' long-lasting affection and the genre's longevity.\nThe 1971 children's book \"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas\" by Lillian Hoban and Russell Hoban and its 1977 television film adaptation feature a jug band composed of woodland creatures. The film version features Muppets characters and a soundtrack composed by Paul Williams.\nJug bands have continued to exist and evolve to the present day. John Sebastian still leads the J-Band, which included not only musicians from the modern folk revival such as the late Fritz Richmond from the Kweskin band, but also the late Yank Rachell, mandolin player and jug band leader from the original era. Some bands remain faithful to the original roots, while others continually expand the jug band repertoire to include other folk music, popular music, jazz and classical music forms, such as The Juggernaut Jug Band of Louisville, Kentucky (formed in the late 1960s and possibly the only full-time jug band in existence at this time), The Cincinnati Dancing Pigs (who also have been together for 40 years), Carolina Chocolate Drops (an African-American jug band that also plays old-time string band tunes), the Hobo Gobbelins, the Kitchen Syncopators and the Inkwell Rhythm Makers. The Connecticut-based Jugadelics is an authentic jug band (i.e., employing a jug player) which continues the traditions of the genre as they employ both homemade and traditional instruments while relying on their own original material written by member Shishka Bob. In San Francisco, there's Devine's Jug Band, which is one of the few jug bands today that actually uses a jug blower full-time. And also in the Bay Area, the \"Mother of Jug Band Music\", Maria Muldaur has formed a new jug band, the Garden of Joy Jug Band, which include members of the Crow Quill Night Owls and the Gallus Brothers. A Canadian group, the Genuine Jug Band, from Vancouver, British Columbia, has most of its original members, who have played together since 1968. In Connecticut, Washboard Slim and the Blue Lights incorporate the blues with the usual ragtime repertoire, as well as original material. The Tennessee-based Jake Leg Stompers continue the traditional Memphis style. The South Austin Jug Band is a young group from Austin, Texas, which plays newer variations on traditional music but does not include a jug player and is not related to the earlier Austin Jug Band which featured vocalists Danny Barton and Galen Barber. The Philadelphia Jug Band has been playing authentic classic jug band music virtually unchanged for over 45 years. The Crow Quill Night Owls from Washington play a mix of 1920s blues, jazz and hillbilly music, which they learned from the 78-rpm records they collect.\nA documentary by Todd Kwait about the history and influence of jug band music, \"Chasin' Gus' Ghost\", first screened at the 2007 San Francisco Jug Band Festival. The film features numerous well-known musicians in interviews and performances, including John Sebastian, Jim Kweskin, Geoff Muldaur, David Grisman, Fritz Richmond, Maria Muldaur, and Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, as well as Sankofa Strings, precursor band to The Carolina Chocolate Drops, and Taj Mahal as the voice of Gus Cannon. Many of these musicians performed at a sold-out concert at the San Francisco Jug Band Festival. \"Chasin' Gus' Ghost\" had its film festival premiere in October 2007 at the Woodstock Film Festival. Kwait produced Sankofa Strings' second album, \"The Uptown Strut\", which featured John Sebastian as guest artist.\nFestivals and competitions.\nThe annual Battle of the Jug Bands in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has been held since 1980. Over 30 jugbands compete for the \"Coveted Hollywood Waffle Iron\" trophy, including the Jook Savages, a jugband that predates Kweskin's band and is still together. The competition is held the Sunday after the Super Bowl. The popularity of the event is such that even though it runs all day, there isn't time for all the bands to compete. In recent years a second competition, the Pancake League, has been added, taking place the day before.\nThe National Jug Band Jubilee was launched in Louisville, Kentucky, the probable birthplace of jug band music, in October 2004.\nIn California, an annual San Francisco Jug Band Festival has been held in San Francisco, California almost every August since 2006 and there is a JugFest gathering of jug bands each August in Sutter Creek, California since around 1998. Both of these free, outdoor, festivals feature a wide variety of jug bands in an all-day format that gives each band plenty of time to stretch out and play a full set. The 1st Annual West Coast Jug Band Jubilee took place in August 2010 in Berkeley, California.\nThe Chicago Battle of the Jug Bands has taken place each fall since 2007. Contestants compete for \"Stuffy,\" a gilded sausage-stuffer. The Chicago battle was initiated by Arlo Leach, then a teacher at Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music. Two years later, when he moved to Portland, Oregon, organizing the battle fell to Skip Landt, another Old Town School teacher. The Chicago competition, which takes place on a single evening, is judged by the audience, who \"vote\" for the winner on a replica of an official Chicago election ballot.\nContemporary bands.\nThe 1990s and 2000s saw another generation of jug band revival, which might be termed postmodern jug band movement. These bands range from traditionalists (covering 1920s and 1930s jazz and blues) to modernists (creating new music from jug band instrumentation and aesthetics).\nScenes of this nature have developed in New York City (centering on the Lower East Side and Red Hook, Brooklyn), Minneapolis, Chicago, Southern California (primarily the Los Angeles area), in the San Francisco Bay area, the Pacific Northwest, and Taipei, Taiwan.\nThe Muddy Basin Ramblers, based in Taiwan, have composed over forty contemporary jug band songs across five albums since 2002. Three of their albums were nominated for the Grammy Awards for their unique and creative design.\nThe National Jug Band Jubilee in mid-September brings contemporary jug bands from as far as New England and the Northwest to Louisville, Kentucky.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

As traditionally used in jazz, zydeco, skiffle, jug band, and old-time music, the washboard remained in its wooden frame and is played primarily by tapping, but also scraping the washboard with thimbles. Often the washboard has additional traps, such as a wood block, a cowbell, and even small cymbals.\nConversely, the frottoir (zydeco rubboard) dispenses with the frame and consists simply of the metal ribbing hung around the neck. It is played primarily with spoon handles or bottle openers in a combination of strumming, scratching, tapping and rolling. \nThe frottoir or \"vest frottoir\" is played as a stroked percussion instrument, often in a band with a drummer, while the washboard generally is a replacement for drums.\nThere is a Polish traditional jazz festival and music award named \"Z\u0142ota Tarka\" (Golden Washboard). In Ukrainian folk music, washboards, or \"zatulas\", are also occasionally used.\nPerformance.\nThere are three general ways of deploying the washboard for use as an instrument. The first, mainly used by American players like Washboard Chaz of the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio and Ralf Reynolds of the Reynolds Brothers Rhythm Rascals, is to drape it vertically down the chest. The second, used by European players like David Langlois of the Blue Vipers of Brooklyn, Ben Turner of Piedmont Bluz, and Stephane Seva of Paris Washboard, is to hold it horizontally across the lap, or, for more complex setups, to mount it horizontally on a purpose-built stand. The third (and least common) method, used by Washboard Sam, S\u00fale Greg Wilson of the Carolina Chocolate Drops and Sankofa Strings, and Deryck Guyler, is to hold it in a perpendicular orientation between the legs while seated, so that both sides of the board might be played at the same time.\nIn a jug band, the washboard can also be stroked with a single whisk broom and functions as the drums for the band, playing only on the back-beat for most songs, a substitute for a snare drum.\nIn Zydeco bands, the frottoir is usually played with bottle openers, to make a louder sound. It tends to play counter-rhythms to the drummer.\nIn a four-beat measure, the washboard will stroke on the 2-beat and the 4-beat. Its best sound is achieved using a single steel-wire snare-brush or whisk broom. However, in a jazz setting, the washboard can also be played with thimbles on all fingers, tapping out much more complex rhythms, as in The Washboard Rhythm Kings, a full-sized band, and Newman Taylor Baker.\nA frottoir is played with a stroking instrument (usually with spoon handles or a pair of bottle-openers) in each hand. In a 4-beat measure, the frottoir will be stroked 8 to 16 times. It plays more like a Latin percussion instrument, rather than as a drum. The rhythms used are often similar to those played on Guiro.\nHistory.\nThe washboard as a percussion instrument ultimately derives from the practice of hamboning as practiced in West Africa and brought to the new world by enslaved Africans. This led to the development of Jug bands which used jugs, spoons, and washboards to provide the rhythm. Jug bands became popular in the 1920s. Washboard Doc, Washboard Willie, and Washboard Sam were famous players.\nThe frottoir, also called a Zydeco rub-board, is a mid-20th century invention designed specifically for Zydeco music. It is one of the few musical instruments invented entirely in the United States and represents a distillation of the washboard into essential elements (percussive surface with shoulder straps). It was designed in 1946 by Clifton Chenier and fashioned by Willie Landry, a friend and metalworker at the Texaco refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. Clifton's brother Cleveland Chenier famously played this newly designed rubboard using bottle openers. Likewise, Willie's son, Tee Don Landry, continues the traditional hand manufacturing of rubboards in his small shop in Sunset, Louisiana, between Lafayette and Opelousas.\nIn 2010 Saint Blues Guitar Workshop launched an electric washboard percussion instrument called the Woogie Board.\nNotable players.\nIn 1941, Spike Jones, known for playing the drums during the 1930s, started to perform with his washboard which would be his icon for his City Slickers that formed that same year.\nIn British Columbia, Canada, Tony McBride, known as \"Mad Fingers McBride\", performs with a group called The Genuine Jug Band. Tony is referred to as \"The Canadian Washboard King\". His percussion set-up was created by Douglas Fraser, of the same band. The washboard set-up was seen in \"Modern Drummer\" magazine, August 2014 edition. Also from Canada, Washboard Hank toured with Fred Eaglesmith.\nMusician Steve Katz famously played washboard with the Even Dozen Jug Band. His playing can be heard on the group's self-titled Elektra recording from 1964. Katz reprised his washboard playing on \"Played a Little Fiddle\", a 2007 recording featuring Steve Katz, Stefan Grossman and Danny Kalb. Katz's washboard approach is notable as he plays the instrument horizontally. Additionally, Katz uses fingerpicks instead of thimbles.\nIn Belgium, Luc Brughmans uses it in te \"La planche \u00e0 jazz\" plays horizontally, with attachment to \u00e0 snare harness.\nIn their earliest incarnations as The Quarrymen, The Beatles were a skiffle band, featuring Pete Shotton on washboard.\nDuring their early years, Mungo Jerry frequently featured washboard on stage and on record, played by Joe Rush.\nTim \"Thumper\" Hogan, plays the washboard on three Grammy-nominated albums with The Muddy Basin Ramblers, based out of Taipei, Taiwan.\nJim \"Dandy\" Mangrum, lead singer of Southern rock band Black Oak Arkansas, is well known for incorporating the washboard into many of the band's songs, notably \"When Electricity Came to Arkansas\". \nSelf-taught Elizabeth Bougerol has made the washboard a key element of The Hot Sardines jazz band.\nCody Dickinson, a member of hill country blues bands the North Mississippi Allstars and Country Hill Revue plays an electrified washboard on a self-written track, \"Psychedelic Sex Machine\". The song is almost entirely centered around the sound of the washboard, captured by a small clip-on microphone. The sound is then sent through a wah-wah and other effects pedals to create a fresher, more innovative and up-to-date sound for the washboard.\nRobin Rapuzzi is the washboard player for New Orleans old-time jazz band Tuba Skinny.\nThe English actor Deryck Guyler was well known for his washboard-playing skills.\nAt least one player has twice appeared at Carnegie Hall.\nWashboard Chaz (Charles Leary) is a contemporary New Orleans\u2013based blues musician appearing in the Playing for Change videos and currently plays regularly with several bands, including the Washboard Chaz Blues Trio, Tin Men, and Palmetto Bug Stompers.\nChris \"Necro\" Wilkinson played washboard for the punk rock and rhythm &amp; blues group The Kings of Nuthin' and Meagan Michelle plays it for folk punk group Days N' Daze.\nIn media.\nBender, a fictional robot from \"Futurama,\" a science fiction animated sitcom, becomes a washboard player in Bendin' in the Wind (Series 3: Episode 13), performing alongside real life musician and guest star Beck.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
