The apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; astronomical, an impact event; destructive, nuclear holocaust or resource depletion; medical, a pandemic, whether natural or human-caused; end time, such as the Last Judgment, Second Coming or Ragnar\u00f6k; or any other scenario in which the outcome is apocalyptic, such as a zombie apocalypse, AI takeover, technological singularity, dysgenics/eugenics, natural disasters, or alien invasions.\nThe story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or it may be post-apocalyptic, set after the event. The time may be directly after the catastrophe, focusing on the psychology of survivors, the way to keep the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been mythologized. Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain.\nNumerous ancient societies, including the Babylonian and Judaic, produced apocalyptic literature and mythology which dealt with the end of the world and human society, such as the \"Epic of Gilgamesh\", written c. 2000\u20131500 BCE. Recognizable modern apocalyptic novels had existed since at least the first third of the 19th century, when Mary Shelley's \"The Last Man\" (1826) was published; however, this form of literature gained widespread popularity after World War II, when the possibility of global annihilation by nuclear weapons entered the public consciousness.\nThemes.\nThe apocalypse event may be climatic, such as runaway climate change; natural, such as an impact event; man made, such as nuclear holocaust; medical, such as a plague or virus, whether natural or man-made; religious, such as the Rapture or Great Tribulation; or imaginative, such as zombie apocalypse or alien invasion. The story may involve attempts to prevent an apocalypse event, deal with the impact and consequences of the event itself, or may be post-apocalyptic and set after the event. The time frame may be immediately after the catastrophe, focusing on the travails or psychology of survivors, the way to maintain the human race alive and together as one, or considerably later, often including the theme that the existence of pre-catastrophe civilization has been forgotten (or mythologized). Post-apocalyptic stories often take place in a non-technological future world, or a world where only scattered elements of society and technology remain.\nOther themes may be cybernetic revolt, divine judgment, dysgenics, ecological collapse, pandemic, resource depletion, supernatural phenomena, technological singularity, or some other general disaster.\nThe relics of a technological past \"protruding into a more primitive... landscape\", a theme known as the \"ruined Earth\", have been described as \"among the most potent of [science fiction]'s icons\".\nAncient predecessors.\nAncient Mesopotamian texts containing the oldest surviving apocalyptic literature, including the Eridu Genesis and the Epic of Gilgamesh, both of which date to around 2000-1500 BCE, describe angry gods sending floods to punish humanity. The Gilgamesh version includes the ancient hero Utnapishtim and his family being saved through the intervention of the god Ea.\nThe Biblical story of Noah and his ark describes the destruction of the corrupt original civilization and its replacement with a remade world. Noah is assigned the task to build the ark and save two of each animal species in order to reestablish a new post-great flood world.\nThe Biblical story of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah also has post-apocalyptic elements. The daughters of Lot, who mistakenly believe that the destruction had engulfed the whole world and that they and their father were the only surviving human beings, conclude that in such a situation it would be justified - and indeed vitally needed - to have sex with their father in order to ensure the survival of humanity. Such situations and dilemmas occur in modern post-apocalyptic fiction.\nThe Biblical Genesis flood narrative is retold in the 71st Chapter of the Quran; \nIn the Hindu Dharmasastra, an apocalyptic deluge plays a prominent part. According to the Matsya Purana, the Matsya avatar of Lord Vishnu, informed the King Manu of an all-destructive deluge which would be coming very soon. The King was advised to build a huge boat (ark) which housed his family, nine types of seeds, pairs of all animals and the Saptarishis to repopulate Earth, after the deluge would end and the oceans and seas would recede. At the time of the deluge, Vishnu appeared as a horned fish and Shesha appeared as a rope, with which Vaivasvata Manu fastened the boat to the horn of the fish. Variants of this story also appear in Buddhist and Jain scriptures.\nThe 1st centuries CE saw the recording of the Book of Revelation (from which the word \"apocalypse\" originated, meaning \"revelation\" in ancient Greek), which is filled with prophecies of destruction, as well as luminous visions. In the first chapter of Revelation, the writer St. John the Divine explains his divine errand: \"Write the things which thou hast seen, the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter\" (Rev. 1:19). He takes it as his mission to convey\u2014to reveal\u2014to God's kingdom His promise that justice will prevail and that the suffering will be vindicated (Leigh). The apocalyptist provides a beatific vision of Judgement Day, revealing God's promise for redemption from suffering and strife. Revelation describes a new Heaven and a new Earth, and its intended Christian audience is often enchanted and inspired, rather than terrified by visions of Judgment Day. These Christians believed themselves chosen for God's salvation, and so such apocalyptic sensibilities inspired optimism and nostalgia for the end times.\nThe Norse poem \"V\u00f6lusp\u00e1\" from the Poetic Edda details the creation, coming doom, and rebirth of the world. The world's destruction includes fire and flood consuming the earth while mythic beasts do battle with the Aesir gods, during which they all perish in an event called Ragnar\u00f6k. After the destruction, a pair of humans, a man and woman, find the world renewed and the god Baldr resurrected.\nIn society.\nSuch works often feature the loss of a global perspective as protagonists are on their own, often with little or no knowledge of the outside world. Furthermore, they often explore a world without modern technology whose rapid progress may overwhelm people as human brains are not adapted to contemporary society, but evolved to deal with issues that have become largely irrelevant, such as immediate physical threats. Such works depict worlds of less complexity, direct contact, and primitive needs. It is often the concept of change as much as the concept of destruction that causes public interest in apocalyptic themes.\nSuch fiction is studied by social sciences, and may provide insights into a culture's fears, as well as things like the role imagined for public administration.\nSince the late 20th century, a surge of popular post-apocalyptic films can be observed.\nChristopher Schmidt notes that, while the world \"goes to waste\" for future generations, we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment. Some have commented on this trend, saying that \"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism\".\nPre-1900 works.\nLord Byron's 1816 poem \"Darkness\", included in \"The Prisoner of Chillon\" collection, on the apocalyptic end of the world and one man's survival, was one of the earliest English-language works in this genre. The sun was blotted out, leading to darkness and cold which kills off mankind through famine and ice-age conditions. The poem was influential in the emergence of \"the last man\" theme which appeared in the works of several poets, such as \"The Last Man\" by Thomas Campbell (1824) and \"The Last Man\" (1826) by Thomas Hood, as well as \"The Last Man\" by Thomas Lovell Beddoes. The year 1816 was known as the Year Without a Summer because Mount Tambora had erupted in the Dutch East Indies in 1815 that emitted sulphur into the atmosphere which lowered the temperature and altered weather patterns throughout the world. This was the source for Byron's poem.\nMary Shelley's novel \"The Last Man\" (1826) is a continuation of the apocalyptic theme in fiction and is generally recognized as the first major fictional post-apocalyptic story. The plot follows a group of people as they struggle to survive in a plague-infected world. The story's male protagonist struggles to keep his family safe but is inevitably left as the last man alive.\nShelley's novel is predated by Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville's French epic prose poem \"Le Dernier Homme\" (English: \"The Last Man\" [1805]), and this work is sometimes considered the first modern work to depict the end of the world. Published after his death in 1805, de Grainville's work follows the character of Omegarus, the titular \"last man,\" in what is essentially a retelling of the Book of Revelation, combined with themes of the story of Adam and Eve. Unlike most apocalyptic tales, de Grainville's novel approaches the end of the world not as a cautionary tale, or a tale of survival, but as both an inevitable, as well as necessary, step for the spiritual resurrection of mankind.\nEdgar Allan Poe's short story \"The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion\" (1839) follows the conversation between two souls in the afterlife as they discuss the destruction of the world. The destruction was brought about by a comet that removed nitrogen from Earth's atmosphere; this left only oxygen and resulted in a worldwide inferno. Similarly, Giacomo Leopardi's short dialogue \"Dialogue between a Goblin and a Gnome\" (1824) features a world without the presence of the human beings, most likely because they \"violate[d] the laws of nature, and [went] contrary to their welfare\".\nRichard Jefferies' novel \"After London\" (1885) can best be described as genuine post-apocalyptic fiction. After a sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature and the few survivors return to a quasi-medieval way of life. The first chapters consist solely of a description of nature reclaiming England: fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland. The rest of the story is a straightforward adventure/quest set many years later in the wild landscape and society, but the opening chapters set an example for many later science fiction stories.\nH.G. Wells wrote several novels that have a post-apocalyptic theme. \"The Time Machine\" (1895) has the unnamed protagonist traveling to the year 802,701 A.D. after civilization has collapsed and humanity has split into two distinct species, the elfin Eloi and the brutal Morlocks. Later in the story, the time traveler moves forward to a dying Earth beneath a swollen red sun. \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898) depicts an invasion of Earth by inhabitants of the planet Mars. The aliens systematically destroy Victorian England with advanced weaponry mounted on nearly indestructible vehicles. Due to the infamous radio adaptation of the novel by Orson Welles on his show, \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", the novel has become one of the best known early apocalyptic works. It has subsequently been reproduced or adapted several times in comic books, film, music, radio programming, television programming, and video games.\nPost-1900 works.\nAliens.\n\"Childhood's End\" is a 1953 science fiction novel by the British author Arthur C. Clarke, in which aliens come to Earth, human children develop fantastic powers and the planet is destroyed.\nArgentine comic writer H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld's comic series \"El Eternauta\" (1957 to 1959), an alien race only mentioned by the protagonists as \"Ellos\" (\"Them\") invades the Earth starting with a deadly snowfall and then using other alien races to defeat the remaining humans.\nIn Alice Sheldon's Nebula-winning novelette \"The Screwfly Solution\" (1977), aliens are wiping out humanity with an airborne agent that changes men's sexual impulses to violent ones.\nDouglas Adams's \"Hitchhiker's Guide\" series (1979\u20132009) is a humorous take on alien invasion stories. Multiple Earths are repeatedly \"demolished\" by the bureaucratic Vogons to make way for a hyperspace bypass, to the chagrin of the protagonist Arthur Dent.\nIn Gene Wolfe's \"The Urth of the New Sun\" (1987), aliens (or highly evolved humans) introduce a white hole into the sun to counteract the dimming effect of a black hole, and the resulting global warming causes a sea-level rise that kills most of the population (though this may be redemptive, like Noah's Flood, rather than a disaster).\nIn Greg Bear's \"The Forge of God\" (1987), Earth is destroyed in an alien attack. Just prior to this, a different group of aliens is able to save samples of the biosphere and a small number of people, resettling them on Mars. Some of these form the crew of a ship to hunt down the homeworld of the killers, as described in the sequel, \"Anvil of Stars\" (1992).\nAl Sarrantonio's \"Moonbane\" (1989) concerns the origin of werewolves (he attributes it to the Moon, which is why they are so attracted to it), and an invasion after an explosion on Luna sends meteoric fragments containing latent lycanthropes to Earth, who thrive in our planet's oxygen-rich atmosphere. \"Moonbane\"'s tone is reminiscent of H. G. Wells' \"War of the Worlds\" (1897).\nCharles R. Pellegrino and George Zebrowski's novel \"The Killing Star\" (1995) describes a devastating attack on a late-21st-century Earth by an alien civilization. Using missiles traveling at relativistic speed, they are determined to destroy the human race in a preemptive strike, as they are considered, after watching several episodes of \"\" which shows human domination in space, a future threat.\nIn the video game \"Chrono Trigger\" (1995), the giant alien creature Lavos collides with the earth in prehistoric times, subsequently hibernating beneath the earth. As millions of years pass, the monster feeds on the energy of the earth, eventually surfacing in 1999 to wreak complete destruction of the human race, atmosphere, and general life on the planet in the form of a rain of destruction fired from its outer shell, known as the \"Day of Lavos\".\nIn the video game \"Half-Life\" (1998), hostile alien creatures arrive on Earth through a portal after a scientific experiment goes wrong. In its sequel, \"Half-Life 2\" (2004), it is revealed to the player the creatures encountered in the first game are merely the slaves of a much more powerful alien race, the Combine, who have taken over the Earth to drain its resources after subduing the entirety of Earth's governments and military forces in only seven hours.\nIn the 2000 Don Bluth animated film \"Titan A.E.\", Earth has been destroyed by the Drej, due to a human experimental discovery called Project Titan, which made them fear \u201cwhat humanity will become\u201d.\nThe 2011 TV series \"Falling Skies\", by Robert Rodat and Steven Spielberg, follows a human resistance force fighting to survive after extraterrestrial aliens attempt to take over Earth by disabling most of the world's technology and destroying its armed forces in a surprise attack. It is implied that the attacking aliens are in reality former victims of an attack on their own planet and are now the slaves of an unseen controller race.\nThe television series \"Defiance\" (2013\u20132015) is set in an Earth devastated by the \"Pale Wars\", a war with seven alien races referred to as the \"Votan\", followed by the \"Arkfalls\", which terraforms Earth to an almost unrecognizable state. Unlike most apocalyptic works, in this one Earth is not inhospitable, and humanity is not on the verge of extinction.\n\"The World's End\" is a 2013 British-American comic science fiction film directed by Edgar Wright, written by Wright and Simon Pegg, and starring Pegg, Nick Frost, Paddy Considine, Martin Freeman, Eddie Marsan and Rosamund Pike. The film follows a group of friends who discover an alien invasion during a pub crawl in their hometown.\nIn the 2018 horror film \"A Quiet Place\", the 2021 sequel \"A Quiet Place Part II\", and a 2024 movie \"\" society has collapsed in the wake of lethal attacks by extraterrestrial creatures who, having no eyesight, hunt humans and other creatures with their highly sensitive hearing; the scattered survivors live most of their lives in near-silence as a result.\nAstronomical.\nIn Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer's novel \"When Worlds Collide\" (1933), Earth is destroyed by the rogue planet Bronson Alpha. A selected few escape on a spaceship. In the sequel, \"After Worlds Collide\" (1934), the survivors start a new life on the planet's companion Bronson Beta, which has taken over the orbit formerly occupied by Earth.\nIn J. T. McIntosh's novel \"One in Three Hundred\" (1954), scientists have discovered how to pinpoint the exact minute, hour, and day the Sun will go \"nova\" \u2013 and when it does, it will boil away Earth's seas, beginning with the hemisphere that faces the sun, and as Earth continues to rotate, it will take only 24 hours before all life is eradicated. Super-hurricanes and tornadoes are predicted. Buildings will be blown away. A race is on to build thousands of spaceships for the sole purpose of transferring evacuees on a one-way trip to Mars. When the Sun begins to go nova, everything is on schedule, but most of the spaceships turn out to be defective, and fail en route to Mars.\nIn Neal Stephenson's novel \"Seveneves\", The Moon is destroyed by an unknown agent, forming a massive debris cloud. This cloud threatens to produce a White Sky, which then causes a massive bombardment of Moon fragments. Due to this, a multinational effort is put in place to construct an ark for the preservation of Humanity, built around the International Space Station.\nBrian Aldiss' novel \"Hothouse\" (1961) occurs in a distant future where the Sun is much hotter and stronger, and the human population has been reduced to a fifth of what it had been.\nJ. G. Ballard's novel \"The Drowned World\" (1962) occurs after a rise in solar radiation that causes worldwide flooding and accelerated mutation of plants and animals.\nJerry Pournelle and Larry Niven's novel, \"Lucifer's Hammer\" (1977), is about a cataclysmic comet hitting Earth and various groups of people struggling to survive the aftermath in southern California.\nHollywood\u2014which previously had explored the idea of the Earth and its population being potentially endangered by a collision with another heavenly body with the \"When Worlds Collide\" (1951), a film treatment of the aforementioned 1933 novel \u2013 revisited the theme in the late 1990s with a trio of similarly themed projects. \"Asteroid\" (1997) is an NBC-TV miniseries about the U.S. government trying to prevent an asteroid from colliding with the Earth. The following year saw dueling big-budget summer blockbuster movies \"Deep Impact\" (1998) and \"Armageddon\" (1998), both of which involved efforts to save the Earth from, respectively, a rogue comet and an asteroid, by landing crews upon them to detonate nuclear weapons there in hopes of destroying them.\nCharacters in the six-part ITV television drama serial \"The Last Train\" (1999) awaken from a cryogenic sleep after an asteroid the size of Birmingham strikes Africa, causing a worldwide apocalypse.\nK. A. Applegate's 2001\u20132003 book series, \"Remnants\", details the end of the world by asteroid collision. The first book, \"The Mayflower Project\" (2001), describes Earth in a sort of hysteria as 80 people are chosen by NASA to board a spacecraft that will go to an unknown destination away from the destroyed Earth. The later books deal with the few survivors waking up from a 500-year hibernation and succumbing to both strange mutations and the will of a strange alien computer/spaceship that they land on. Eventually they return to Earth to find a couple colonies of survivors struggling on a harsh planet completely different from the Earth the Remnants knew.\n\"Melancholia\" (2011), the middle entry of filmmaker Lars von Trier's \"depression trilogy\", ends with humanity completely wiped out by a collision with a rogue planet. The depressed protagonist reverses roles with her relatives as the crisis unfolds, as she turns out to be the only family member capable of calmly accepting the imminent impact event.\nIn id Software's video game \"Rage\" (2011), Earth is heavily damaged, and humanity nearly wiped out, by the direct collision of the real asteroid 99942 Apophis with the Earth in the year 2029.\nMarly Youmans' epic poem \"Thaliad\" (2012) tells the story of a group of children after an unspecified apocalypse from the sky, perhaps connected with solar flares or meteor impact, resulting in people and animals having been burned and the skies having filled with ash. The children survive only because they were together on a school visit to a cave.\nIn the obscure 2013 Australian film \"These Final Hours\", a massive asteroid hits the Atlantic Ocean dooming all life. The film follows James, who decides to head to the 'party-to-end-all-parties' and there spend the last 12 hours before the global firestorm reaches Western Australia.\nIn the 2020 film \"Greenland\", a massive comet, Clarke, is set on a collision course with Earth, with only a few people permitted into a massive complex of bunkers in Greenland. The film follows the Garrity family's attempts to reach these safe havens after they were unable to board the transport aircraft to the bunkers. Clarke collides with Earth, leaving the planet devastated; however, there are survivors throughout the world, implying that Humanity can still survive. A sequel is now in development called \".\"\nCozy catastrophe.\nThe \"cozy catastrophe\" is not an intentional style of post-apocalyptic science fiction, but rather a criticism of certain apocalyptic works considered as not believably harsh enough for the critic's stated preferences.\nStories subject to this criticism generally involve some sort of catastrophe wherein civilization comes to an end with mass deaths, but the main characters survive relatively unscathed and are freed from the constraints of vulgar civilization in their hideaway, perhaps finding a kind of quiet happiness in the changed world.\nThe term was coined by Brian Aldiss in \"Billion Year Spree: The History of Science Fiction\" (1973). Aldiss was directing his remarks mainly at novels of English author John Wyndham such as \"The Kraken Wakes\" (1953), but especially his novel \"The Day of the Triffids\" (1951), whose protagonists did not suffer enough associated hardship from the collapse of society for Aldiss's taste, as well as other British books in the era following the Second World War.\nThe genre has been defended though as being a valid take on more low-key catastrophes of an ecological sort, and some question whether other books qualify at all\u00a0\u2013 Margaret Atwood defended \"The Day of the Triffids\" as not as \"cozy\" as alleged, for example.\nEnvironmental disaster.\n\"The Purple Cloud\" (1901) by M. P. Shiel is a novel in which most of humanity has been killed by a poisonous cloud issuing from volcanic eruptions.\nIn Alfred Walter Stewart's 1923 novel \"Nordenholt's Million\", an engineered strain of bacteria denitrifies almost all plants, causing a collapse of food supply. The plutocrat of the title establishes a haven in central Scotland for a chosen group of survivors, while deliberately wrecking all alternative refuges.\nIn Alfred Bester's story \"Adam and No Eve\" (1941), an inventor takes off in a rocket whose propulsion uses a dangerous catalyst. From outer space he sees that the entire world has been destroyed by fire in a runaway reaction caused by the catalyst. Fatally injured in a crash landing, he crawls to the sea so that the bacteria in his body can initiate new life on Earth.\nIn John Christopher's novel \"The Death of Grass\" (1956), a mutated virus kills cereal crops and other grasses throughout Eurasia, causing famine.\nKurt Vonnegut 's novel \"Cat's Cradle\" (1963) ends with all the bodies of water turning into \"ice-nine\", a fictional phase of ice that forms at room temperature.\nIn J. G. Ballard's novel \"The Burning World\" (1964, expanded into \"The Drought\" in 1965), pollution in the oceans creates a surface layer that resists evaporation, bringing about a worldwide drought.\nJohn Brunner's novel \"The Sheep Look Up\" (1972) describes an environmentally degraded world rapidly collapsing into social chaos, revolution, and anarchy.\nRichard Cowper's three-volume novel \"The White Bird of Kinship\" (1978\u201382) envisions a future in which anthropogenic global warming has led to a catastrophic rise in sea level. Most of it takes place two millennia later.\nUrsula K. Le Guin's novel \"Always Coming Home\" (1985) takes place long after worldwide disasters\u2014apparently largely environmental though nuclear war may also be involved\u2014have drastically reduced the population. It paints an admiring picture of a primitive society that will not repeat the mistakes of civilization. It won the Janet Heidinger Kafka Prize and was a runner-up for a National Book Award.\nChuck Dixon's \"Winterworld\" comic has the anti-hero Scully and Rah-Rah the badger team up with teenage Wynn to take on a world fallen to winter. Continued in La Nina, Frozen Fleet, and the book The Mechanic's Song\nPalladium Books' \"Rifts\" roleplaying game (1990) features an apocalypse caused by various natural disasters including the eruption of the Yellowstone supervolcano which releases a large amount of magical energy that is amplified by deaths of millions occurring during a solstice, at midnight, during a planetary alignment, creating the titular rifts that bring forth various beings and monstrosities from throughout the Megaverse.\nIn Octavia Butler's 1993 novel \"Parable of the Sower\", climate change and corporatism are the human-caused reasons for societal collapse.\nIn the film \"The Day After Tomorrow\" (2004), based on Art Bell\u2019s and Whitley Strieber's speculative non-fiction novel \"The Coming Global Superstorm\" (1999), extreme weather events caused by climate change invoke mass destruction across the planet, and eventually result in a new ice age.\nThe video game \"The Long Dark\" (2017) depicts survival in the wilderness of northern Canada during winter after a geomagnetic disaster has disabled all modern technology.\n (2002) features a world where a magic flood destroyed all settlements that were not located on mountain peaks.\nFailure of modern technology.\nIn E. M. Forster's novelette \"The Machine Stops\" (1909), humanity has been forced underground due to inhospitable conditions on Earth's surface, and is entirely dependent on \"the machine,\" a god-like mechanical entity which has supplanted almost all free will by providing for humankind's every whim. The machine deteriorates and eventually stops, ending the lives of all those dependent upon it, though one of the dying alludes to a group of humans dwelling on the surface who will carry the torch of humanity into the future.\nIn Ren\u00e9 Barjavel's novel \"Ravage\" (1943), written and published during the German occupation of France, a future France is devastated by the sudden failure of electricity, causing chaos, disease, and famine, with a small band of survivors desperately struggling for survival.\nFred Saberhagen goes one better than Barjavel with the \"Empire of the East\" series which starts, in the 1968 book \"The Broken Lands\", sometime after the \"Change\" (with sincere nods from Boyett and Stirling), in which a defense designed to temporarily make nukes inoperative, permanently changes some of the laws of science for magic.\nSteve Boyett's novel \"Ariel\" (1983, sub-titled \"A Book of the Change\") also has all technology\u2014including electricity, gunpowder, and some physics principles\u2014ceasing to function, while magic becomes real. He also contributed to the 1986 Borderland series, which investigates a return of the Realm of Faery to the world.\n\"The Quiet Earth\", a 1985 New Zealand movie notable for its visually stunning ending, follows a scientist's descent into madness after he wakes up to a world where every single member of the kingdom Animalia has seemingly disappeared. After recovering and finding other people, he realizes his experiments with energy transfers through the Earth's magnetic field are to blame, and that unless he shuts down the experiment, it will destroy the planet.\nS. M. Stirling also takes a swipe at the inconstant-physical-constants field with the \"Emberverse\" series. \"Dies the Fire\" (2004), \"The Protector's War\" (2005), and \"A Meeting at Corvallis\" (2006), depict the world's descent into feudalism after a sudden mysterious \"change\" alters physical laws so that electricity, gunpowder, and most forms of high-energy-density technology no longer work. Civilization collapses, and two competing groups struggle to re-create medieval technologies and skills, as well as master magic. Like Boyett's novel, Stirling's features Society for Creative Anachronism members as favorably disposed survivors, and a hang glider attack against a building.\n\"Afterworld\" (first aired in 2007) is an animated American science fiction television series where a network of satellites firing persistent electronic pulses, combined with a strange nanotechnology, has not only destroyed most electronic technology on the planet, but also caused the deaths of 99% of humanity, and is now causing strange mutations to occur in lower forms of life.\nThe video game series \"S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\" is set after a second Chernobyl Disaster which pollutes the Ukrainian Countryside, resulting in otherworldly changes to the environment, causing the flora, fauna and laws of physics to irreversibly morph and mutate.\nJohn Barnes' \"Daybreak\" series (starting 2010) deals with an America devastated by a nanotech swarm.\nNBC's \"Revolution\" (2012\u20132014) also revolved around a \"change\" after which the principles of electricity and physics are inoperable; however, the focus of the story was how a group of protagonists tried to get the power back on while opposing the efforts of a tyrannical militia leader to understand it first (so that he can take absolute power).\nThe web series \"\" (2012-2013) depicts in part, the aftermath of a world in which a computer virus that infected a popular brain-computer interface killed one-third of the population, leading to a breakdown in order and the lack or shortage of electricity and other modern conveniences.\n\"All Systems Down\" (2018) is an American novel which describes a cyber war that cripples Western infrastructure, resulting in the collapse of society.\nRobert Harris's novel \"The Second Sleep\" (2019) is set in a fundamentalist agrarian society several centuries after the collapse of global civilisation, which is implied to be the result of a sudden breakdown of the internet, possibly as the result of cyberwarfare.\nAI takeover and technological singularity.\nThe topic of technological singularity, also known as \u201csingularity,\u201d was first coined in 1993. Since then, the idea of the term has been used to produce countless major motion pictures and earn Hollywood producers millions of dollars at the box office. The \"singularity\" refers to a future moment in human history when science and science fiction, religion and philosophy, and hope and fear converge. The mathematician and science fiction writer Vernor Vinge coined the term to denote a juncture when artificial intelligence (AI) equals, and then in an intelligence explosion, far exceeds man intelligence.\u201d In laymen's terms, technological singularity is the theoretical future moment when artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence and becomes aware, autonomous, and potentially threatening to humans. \nFossil fuel supply scarcities.\nThe film \"Mad Max\" (1979), directed by George Miller, presents a world in which oil resources have been nearly exhausted. This has resulted in constant energy shortages and a breakdown of law and order. The police do battle with criminal motorcycle gangs, with the result being the complete breakdown of modern society and nuclear war as depicted in \"Mad Max 2\" (1981). The opening narration of \"Mad Max 2\" implies that the fuel shortage was caused not just by peak oil, but also by oil reserves being destroyed during a large scale conflict in the Middle East. The remnants of society survive either through scavenging, or in one notable case, as depicted in the third sequel \"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\" (1985), by using methane derived from pig feces.\nJames Howard Kunstler's novel \"World Made By Hand\" (2008) imagines life in upstate New York after a declining world oil supply has wreaked havoc on the US economy, and people and society are forced to adjust to daily life without cheap oil.\nCanadian novelist Douglas Coupland's book \"Player One\" (2010) deals with four individuals taking refuge in a Toronto airport bar while a series of cataclysmic events occurs outside.\nAlex Scarrow's novel \"Last Light\" and its sequel \"Afterlight\" narrate the fall of British civilization after a war in the Middle East eradicates the majority of the Earth's oil supply.\nThe backstory of the video game series \"Fallout\" revolves around the so-called \"Resource Wars\", beginning circa 2050, when oil supplies become depleted, leading to a disastrous series of wars that include Europe going to war with the Middle East before disintegrating into warring nation-states after all available oil is used up, the United Nations collapsing, the U.S annexing Mexico and Canada, and finally total nuclear war between the U.S and China in 2077 after over 25 years of war.\nPandemic.\nComics.\n\"Crossed\" by Garth Ennis is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which a bodily fluid-borne virus has destroyed civilization. Carriers of the virus develop a cross-shaped rash on their faces and act without inhibitions, raping, killing and torturing the few remaining uninfected humans.\n\"\" by Brian K.

The games revolve around \"vaults,\" underground bunkers for long-term survival (in reality social experiments created by the ruling elite of the pre-war United States), and exploring the outside wasteland, in locations such as California, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., New England, and West Virginia. \"Fallout\" draws heavily from retro 1950s sci-fi, and the setting combines elements of mid-20th century technology, such as vacuum tubes and monochrome screens, with highly advanced artificial intelligences and energy weapons.\nIn \"Metro 2033\" (2010), a nuclear war occurs in late 2013. Russia was targeted with atomic bombs, causing severe radiation across Moscow, forcing the rest of the people to live underground in the metro stations away from the deadly effects of radiation. Many animals and humans left behind mutated into creatures known as the Dark Ones, who were left outside for the next 20 years. The game is played from the perspective of Artyom, a 20-year-old male survivor and one of the many children brought into the metro right before the bombs dropped. The story takes place in post-apocalyptic Moscow, mostly inside the metro system, but some missions have the player go to the surface which is severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times due to the toxic air. A sequel, ' was released in 2013. A sequel to \"Metro: Last Light\"; ' was produced in 2019.\nNuclear apocalypse followed by a demon invasion is a recurring staple of the \"Shin Megami Tensei\" series.

Developed at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, SVMs are one of the most studied models, being based on statistical learning frameworks of VC theory proposed by Vapnik (1982, 1995) and Chervonenkis (1974).\nIn addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classification using the , representing the data only through a set of pairwise similarity comparisons between the original data points using a kernel function, which transforms them into coordinates in a higher-dimensional feature space. Thus, SVMs use the kernel trick to implicitly map their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces, where linear classification can be performed. Being max-margin models, SVMs are resilient to noisy data (e.g., misclassified examples). SVMs can also be used for regression tasks, where the objective becomes formula_1-sensitive.\nThe support vector clustering algorithm, created by Hava Siegelmann and Vladimir Vapnik, applies the statistics of support vectors, developed in the support vector machines algorithm, to categorize unlabeled data. These data sets require unsupervised learning approaches, which attempt to find natural clustering of the data into groups, and then to map new data according to these clusters.\nThe popularity of SVMs is likely due to their amenability to theoretical analysis, and their flexibility in being applied to a wide variety of tasks, including structured prediction problems. It is not clear that SVMs have better predictive performance than other linear models, such as logistic regression and linear regression.\nMotivation.\nClassifying data is a common task in machine learning.\nSuppose some given data points each belong to one of two classes, and the goal is to decide which class a \"new\" data point will be in. In the case of support vector machines, a data point is viewed as a formula_2-dimensional vector (a list of formula_2 numbers), and we want to know whether we can separate such points with a formula_4-dimensional hyperplane. This is called a linear classifier. There are many hyperplanes that might classify the data. One reasonable choice as the best hyperplane is the one that represents the largest separation, or margin, between the two classes. So we choose the hyperplane so that the distance from it to the nearest data point on each side is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, it is known as the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" and the linear classifier it defines is known as a \"maximum-margin classifier\"; or equivalently, the \"perceptron of optimal stability\".\nMore formally, a support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high or infinite-dimensional space, which can be used for classification, regression, or other tasks like outlier detection. Intuitively, a good separation is achieved by the hyperplane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class (so-called functional margin), since in general the larger the margin, the lower the generalization error of the classifier. A lower generalization error means that the implementer is less likely to experience overfitting.\nWhereas the original problem may be stated in a finite-dimensional space, it often happens that the sets to discriminate are not linearly separable in that space. For this reason, it was proposed that the original finite-dimensional space be mapped into a much higher-dimensional space, presumably making the separation easier in that space. To keep the computational load reasonable, the mappings used by SVM schemes are designed to ensure that dot products of pairs of input data vectors may be computed easily in terms of the variables in the original space, by defining them in terms of a kernel function formula_5 selected to suit the problem. The hyperplanes in the higher-dimensional space are defined as the set of points whose dot product with a vector in that space is constant, where such a set of vectors is an orthogonal (and thus minimal) set of vectors that defines a hyperplane. The vectors defining the hyperplanes can be chosen to be linear combinations with parameters formula_6 of images of feature vectors formula_7 that occur in the data base. With this choice of a hyperplane, the points formula_8 in the feature space that are mapped into the hyperplane are defined by the relation formula_9 Note that if formula_5 becomes small as formula_11 grows further away from formula_8, each term in the sum measures the degree of closeness of the test point formula_8 to the corresponding data base point formula_7. In this way, the sum of kernels above can be used to measure the relative nearness of each test point to the data points originating in one or the other of the sets to be discriminated. Note the fact that the set of points formula_8 mapped into any hyperplane can be quite convoluted as a result, allowing much more complex discrimination between sets that are not convex at all in the original space.\nApplications.\nSVMs can be used to solve various real-world problems:\nHistory.\nThe original SVM algorithm was invented by Vladimir N. Vapnik and Alexey Ya. Chervonenkis in 1964. In 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The \"soft margin\" incarnation, as is commonly used in software packages, was proposed by Corinna Cortes and Vapnik in 1993 and published in 1995.\nLinear SVM.\nWe are given a training dataset of formula_16 points of the form\nformula_17\nwhere the formula_18 are either 1 or \u22121, each indicating the class to which the point formula_19 belongs. Each formula_19 is a formula_2-dimensional real vector. We want to find the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" that divides the group of points formula_22 for which formula_23 from the group of points for which formula_24, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point formula_19 from either group is maximized.\nAny hyperplane can be written as the set of points formula_26 satisfying\nformula_27\nwhere formula_28 is the (not necessarily normalized) normal vector to the hyperplane. This is much like Hesse normal form, except that formula_28 is not necessarily a unit vector. The parameter formula_30 determines the offset of the hyperplane from the origin along the normal vector formula_28.\nWarning: most of the literature on the subject defines the bias so that\nformula_32\nHard-margin.\nIf the training data is linearly separable, we can select two parallel hyperplanes that separate the two classes of data, so that the distance between them is as large as possible. The region bounded by these two hyperplanes is called the \"margin\", and the maximum-margin hyperplane is the hyperplane that lies halfway between them. With a normalized or standardized dataset, these hyperplanes can be described by the equations\n formula_33 (anything on or above this boundary is of one class, with label 1)\nand\n formula_34 (anything on or below this boundary is of the other class, with label \u22121).\nGeometrically, the distance between these two hyperplanes is formula_35, so to maximize the distance between the planes we want to minimize formula_36. The distance is computed using the distance from a point to a plane equation. We also have to prevent data points from falling into the margin, we add the following constraint: for each formula_37 either\nformula_38\nor\nformula_39\nThese constraints state that each data point must lie on the correct side of the margin.\nThis can be rewritten as\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe can put this together to get the optimization problem:\nformula_40\nThe formula_28 and formula_42 that solve this problem determine the final classifier, formula_43, where formula_44 is the sign function.\nAn important consequence of this geometric description is that the max-margin hyperplane is completely determined by those formula_22 that lie nearest to it (explained below). These formula_22 are called \"support vectors\".\nSoft-margin.\nTo extend SVM to cases in which the data are not linearly separable, the \"hinge loss\" function is helpful\nformula_47\nNote that formula_18 is the \"i\"-th target (i.e., in this case, 1 or \u22121), and formula_49 is the \"i\"-th output.\nThis function is zero if the constraint in (1) is satisfied, in other words, if formula_22 lies on the correct side of the margin. For data on the wrong side of the margin, the function's value is proportional to the distance from the margin.\nThe goal of the optimization then is to minimize:\nformula_51\nwhere the parameter formula_52 determines the trade-off between increasing the margin size and ensuring that the formula_22 lie on the correct side of the margin (Note we can add a weight to either term in the equation above). By deconstructing the hinge loss, this optimization problem can be formulated into the following:\nformula_54\nThus, for large values of formula_55, it will behave similar to the hard-margin SVM, if the input data are linearly classifiable, but will still learn if a classification rule is viable or not.\nNonlinear kernels.\nThe original maximum-margin hyperplane algorithm proposed by Vapnik in 1963 constructed a linear classifier. However, in 1992, Bernhard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladimir Vapnik suggested a way to create nonlinear classifiers by applying the kernel trick (originally proposed by Aizerman et al.) to maximum-margin hyperplanes. The kernel trick, where dot products are replaced by kernels, is easily derived in the dual representation of the SVM problem. This allows the algorithm to fit the maximum-margin hyperplane in a transformed feature space. The transformation may be nonlinear and the transformed space high-dimensional; although the classifier is a hyperplane in the transformed feature space, it may be nonlinear in the original input space.\nIt is noteworthy that working in a higher-dimensional feature space increases the generalization error of support vector machines, although given enough samples the algorithm still performs well.\nSome common kernels include:\nThe kernel is related to the transform formula_65 by the equation formula_66. The value w is also in the transformed space, with formula_67. Dot products with w for classification can again be computed by the kernel trick, i.e. formula_68.\nComputing the SVM classifier.\nComputing the (soft-margin) SVM classifier amounts to minimizing an expression of the form\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Numbered block/styles.css\" /&gt;\nWe focus on the soft-margin classifier since, as noted above, choosing a sufficiently small value for formula_69 yields the hard-margin classifier for linearly classifiable input data. The classical approach, which involves reducing (2) to a quadratic programming problem, is detailed below. Then, more recent approaches such as sub-gradient descent and coordinate descent will be discussed.\nPrimal.\nMinimizing (2) can be rewritten as a constrained optimization problem with a differentiable objective function in the following way.\nFor each formula_70 we introduce a variable formula_71. Note that formula_72 is the smallest nonnegative number satisfying formula_73\nThus we can rewrite the optimization problem as follows\nformula_74\nThis is called the \"primal\" problem.\nDual.\nBy solving for the Lagrangian dual of the above problem, one obtains the simplified problem\nformula_75\nThis is called the \"dual\" problem. Since the dual maximization problem is a quadratic function of the formula_76 subject to linear constraints, it is efficiently solvable by quadratic programming algorithms.\nHere, the variables formula_76 are defined such that\nformula_78\nMoreover, formula_79 exactly when formula_80 lies on the correct side of the margin, and formula_81 when formula_80 lies on the margin's boundary. It follows that formula_28 can be written as a linear combination of the support vectors.\nThe offset, formula_84, can be recovered by finding an formula_80 on the margin's boundary and solving\nformula_86\nKernel trick.\nSuppose now that we would like to learn a nonlinear classification rule which corresponds to a linear classification rule for the transformed data points formula_89 Moreover, we are given a kernel function formula_90 which satisfies formula_91.\nWe know the classification vector formula_28 in the transformed space satisfies\nformula_93\nwhere, the formula_94 are obtained by solving the optimization problem\nformula_95\nThe coefficients formula_76 can be solved for using quadratic programming, as before. Again, we can find some index formula_97 such that formula_81, so that formula_99 lies on the boundary of the margin in the transformed space, and then solve\nformula_100\nFinally,\nformula_101\nModern methods.\nRecent algorithms for finding the SVM classifier include sub-gradient descent and coordinate descent. Both techniques have proven to offer significant advantages over the traditional approach when dealing with large, sparse datasets\u2014sub-gradient methods are especially efficient when there are many training examples, and coordinate descent when the dimension of the feature space is high.\nSub-gradient descent.\nSub-gradient descent algorithms for the SVM work directly with the expression\nformula_102\nNote that formula_103 is a convex function of formula_28 and formula_42. As such, traditional gradient descent (or SGD) methods can be adapted, where instead of taking a step in the direction of the function's gradient, a step is taken in the direction of a vector selected from the function's sub-gradient. This approach has the advantage that, for certain implementations, the number of iterations does not scale with formula_16, the number of data points.\nCoordinate descent.\nCoordinate descent algorithms for the SVM work from the dual problem\nformula_107\nFor each formula_108, iteratively, the coefficient formula_76 is adjusted in the direction of formula_110. Then, the resulting vector of coefficients formula_111 is projected onto the nearest vector of coefficients that satisfies the given constraints. (Typically Euclidean distances are used.) The process is then repeated until a near-optimal vector of coefficients is obtained. The resulting algorithm is extremely fast in practice, although few performance guarantees have been proven.\nEmpirical risk minimization.\nThe soft-margin support vector machine described above is an example of an empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm for the \"hinge loss\". Seen this way, support vector machines belong to a natural class of algorithms for statistical inference, and many of its unique features are due to the behavior of the hinge loss. This perspective can provide further insight into how and why SVMs work, and allow us to better analyze their statistical properties.\nRisk minimization.\nIn supervised learning, one is given a set of training examples formula_112 with labels formula_113, and wishes to predict formula_114 given formula_115. To do so one forms a hypothesis, formula_103, such that formula_117 is a \"good\" approximation of formula_114. A \"good\" approximation is usually defined with the help of a \"loss function,\" formula_119, which characterizes how bad formula_120 is as a prediction of formula_11. We would then like to choose a hypothesis that minimizes the \"expected risk:\"\nformula_122\nIn most cases, we don't know the joint distribution of formula_123 outright. In these cases, a common strategy is to choose the hypothesis that minimizes the \"empirical risk:\"\nformula_124\nUnder certain assumptions about the sequence of random variables formula_125 (for example, that they are generated by a finite Markov process), if the set of hypotheses being considered is small enough, the minimizer of the empirical risk will closely approximate the minimizer of the expected risk as formula_16 grows large. This approach is called \"empirical risk minimization,\" or ERM.\nRegularization and stability.\nIn order for the minimization problem to have a well-defined solution, we have to place constraints on the set formula_127 of hypotheses being considered. If formula_127 is a normed space (as is the case for SVM), a particularly effective technique is to consider only those hypotheses formula_129 for which formula_130 . This is equivalent to imposing a \"regularization penalty\" formula_131, and solving the new optimization problem\nformula_132\nThis approach is called \"Tikhonov regularization.\"\nMore generally, formula_133 can be some measure of the complexity of the hypothesis formula_103, so that simpler hypotheses are preferred.\nSVM and the hinge loss.\nRecall that the (soft-margin) SVM classifier formula_135 is chosen to minimize the following expression:\nformula_136\nIn light of the above discussion, we see that the SVM technique is equivalent to empirical risk minimization with Tikhonov regularization, where in this case the loss function is the hinge loss\nformula_137\nFrom this perspective, SVM is closely related to other fundamental classification algorithms such as regularized least-squares and logistic regression. The difference between the three lies in the choice of loss function: regularized least-squares amounts to empirical risk minimization with the square-loss, formula_138; logistic regression employs the log-loss,\nformula_139\nTarget functions.\nThe difference between the hinge loss and these other loss functions is best stated in terms of \"target functions -\" the function that minimizes expected risk for a given pair of random variables formula_140.\nIn particular, let formula_141 denote formula_11 conditional on the event that formula_143. In the classification setting, we have:\nformula_144\nThe optimal classifier is therefore:\nformula_145\nFor the square-loss, the target function is the conditional expectation function, formula_146; For the logistic loss, it's the logit function, formula_147. While both of these target functions yield the correct classifier, as formula_148, they give us more information than we need. In fact, they give us enough information to completely describe the distribution of formula_149.\nOn the other hand, one can check that the target function for the hinge loss is \"exactly\" formula_150. Thus, in a sufficiently rich hypothesis space\u2014or equivalently, for an appropriately chosen kernel\u2014the SVM classifier will converge to the simplest function (in terms of formula_151) that correctly classifies the data. This extends the geometric interpretation of SVM\u2014for linear classification, the empirical risk is minimized by any function whose margins lie between the support vectors, and the simplest of these is the max-margin classifier.\nProperties.\nSVMs belong to a family of generalized linear classifiers and can be interpreted as an extension of the perceptron. They can also be considered a special case of Tikhonov regularization. A special property is that they simultaneously minimize the empirical \"classification error\" and maximize the \"geometric margin\"; hence they are also known as maximum margin classifiers.\nA comparison of the SVM to other classifiers has been made by Meyer, Leisch and Hornik.\nParameter selection.\nThe effectiveness of SVM depends on the selection of kernel, the kernel's parameters, and soft margin parameter formula_69.\nA common choice is a Gaussian kernel, which has a single parameter \"formula_153\". The best combination of formula_69 and formula_153 is often selected by a grid search with exponentially growing sequences of formula_69 and \"formula_153\", for example, formula_158; formula_159. Typically, each combination of parameter choices is checked using cross validation, and the parameters with best cross-validation accuracy are picked. Alternatively, recent work in Bayesian optimization can be used to select formula_69 and \"formula_153\" , often requiring the evaluation of far fewer parameter combinations than grid search. The final model, which is used for testing and for classifying new data, is then trained on the whole training set using the selected parameters.\nIssues.\nPotential drawbacks of the SVM include the following aspects:\nExtensions.\nMulticlass SVM.\nMulticlass SVM aims to assign labels to instances by using support vector machines, where the labels are drawn from a finite set of several elements.\nThe dominant approach for doing so is to reduce the single multiclass problem into multiple binary classification problems. Common methods for such reduction include:\nCrammer and Singer proposed a multiclass SVM method which casts the multiclass classification problem into a single optimization problem, rather than decomposing it into multiple binary classification problems. See also Lee, Lin and Wahba and Van den Burg and Groenen.\nTransductive support vector machines.\nTransductive support vector machines extend SVMs in that they could also treat partially labeled data in semi-supervised learning by following the principles of transduction. Here, in addition to the training set formula_162, the learner is also given a set\nformula_163\nof test examples to be classified. Formally, a transductive support vector machine is defined by the following primal optimization problem:\nMinimize (in formula_164)\nformula_165\nsubject to (for any formula_166 and any formula_167)\nformula_168\nand\nformula_169\nTransductive support vector machines were introduced by Vladimir N. Vapnik in 1998.\nStructured SVM.\nStructured support-vector machine is an extension of the traditional SVM model. While the SVM model is primarily designed for binary classification, multiclass classification, and regression tasks, structured SVM broadens its application to handle general structured output labels, for example parse trees, classification with taxonomies, sequence alignment and many more.\nRegression.\nA version of SVM for regression was proposed in 1996 by Vladimir N. Vapnik, Harris Drucker, Christopher J. C. Burges, Linda Kaufman and Alexander J. Smola. This method is called support vector regression (SVR). The model produced by support vector classification (as described above) depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model does not care about training points that lie beyond the margin. Analogously, the model produced by SVR depends only on a subset of the training data, because the cost function for building the model ignores any training data close to the model prediction. Another SVM version known as least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) has been proposed by Suykens and Vandewalle.\nTraining the original SVR means solving\n minimize formula_170\n subject to formula_171\nwhere formula_7 is a training sample with target value formula_18. The inner product plus intercept formula_174 is the prediction for that sample, and formula_175 is a free parameter that serves as a threshold: all predictions have to be within an formula_175 range of the true predictions. Slack variables are usually added into the above to allow for errors and to allow approximation in the case the above problem is infeasible.\nBayesian SVM.\nIn 2011 it was shown by Polson and Scott that the SVM admits a Bayesian interpretation through the technique of data augmentation. In this approach the SVM is viewed as a graphical model (where the parameters are connected via probability distributions). This extended view allows the application of Bayesian techniques to SVMs, such as flexible feature modeling, automatic hyperparameter tuning, and predictive uncertainty quantification. In 2017, a scalable version of the Bayesian SVM was developed by https://, enabling the application of Bayesian SVMs to big data. Florian Wenzel developed two different versions, a variational inference (VI) scheme for the Bayesian kernel support vector machine (SVM) and a stochastic version (SVI) for the linear Bayesian SVM.\nImplementation.\nThe parameters of the maximum-margin hyperplane are derived by solving the optimization. There exist several specialized algorithms for quickly solving the quadratic programming (QP) problem that arises from SVMs, mostly relying on heuristics for breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks.\nAnother approach is to use an interior-point method that uses Newton-like iterations to find a solution of the Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker conditions of the primal and dual problems.\nInstead of solving a sequence of broken-down problems, this approach directly solves the problem altogether. To avoid solving a linear system involving the large kernel matrix, a low-rank approximation to the matrix is often used in the kernel trick.\nAnother common method is Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO) algorithm, which breaks the problem down into 2-dimensional sub-problems that are solved analytically, eliminating the need for a numerical optimization algorithm and matrix storage. This algorithm is conceptually simple, easy to implement, generally faster, and has better scaling properties for difficult SVM problems.\nThe special case of linear support vector machines can be solved more efficiently by the same kind of algorithms used to optimize its close cousin, logistic regression; this class of algorithms includes sub-gradient descent (e.g., PEGASOS) and coordinate descent (e.g., LIBLINEAR). LIBLINEAR has some attractive training-time properties. Each convergence iteration takes time linear in the time taken to read the train data, and the iterations also have a Q-linear convergence property, making the algorithm extremely fast.\nThe general kernel SVMs can also be solved more efficiently using sub-gradient descent (e.g. P-packSVM), especially when parallelization is allowed.\nKernel SVMs are available in many machine-learning toolkits, including LIBSVM, MATLAB, http://, SVMlight, https://, scikit-learn, Shogun, Weka, http://, https://, OpenCV and others.\nPreprocessing of data (standardization) is highly recommended to enhance accuracy of classification. There are a few methods of standardization, such as min-max, normalization by decimal scaling, Z-score. Subtraction of mean and division by variance of each feature is usually used for SVM.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"Arawak\" has been applied at various times to different Indigenous groups, from the Lokono of South America to the Ta\u00edno (Island Arawaks), who lived in the Greater Antilles and northern Lesser Antilles in the Caribbean. All these groups spoke related Arawakan languages.\nName.\nEarly Spanish explorers and administrators used the terms \"Arawak\" and \"Caribs\" to distinguish the peoples of the Caribbean, with \"Carib\" reserved for Indigenous groups that they considered hostile and \"Arawak\" for groups that they considered friendly.\nIn 1871, ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton proposed calling the Caribbean populace \"Island Arawak\" because of their cultural and linguistic similarities with the mainland Arawak. Subsequent scholars shortened this convention to \"Arawak\", creating confusion between the island and mainland groups. In the 20th century, scholars such as Irving Rouse resumed using \"Ta\u00edno\" for the Caribbean group to emphasize their distinct culture and language.\nHistory.\nThe Arawakan languages may have emerged in the Orinoco River valley in present-day Venezuela. They subsequently spread widely, becoming by far the most extensive language family in South America at the time of European contact, with speakers located in various areas along the Orinoco and Amazonian rivers and their tributaries. The group that self-identified as the Arawak, also known as the Lokono, settled the coastal areas of what is now Guyana, Suriname, Grenada, Bahamas, Jamaica and parts of the islands of Trinidad and Tobago.\nMichael Heckenberger, an anthropologist at the University of Florida who helped found the Central Amazon Project, and his team found elaborate pottery, ringed villages, raised fields, large mounds, and evidence for regional trade networks that are all indicators of a complex culture. There is also evidence that they modified the soil using various techniques such as adding charcoal to transform it into black earth, which even today is famed for its agricultural productivity. Maize and sweet potatoes were their main crops, though they also grew cassava and yautia. The Arawaks fished using nets made of fibers, bones, hooks, and harpoons. According to Heckenberger, pottery and other cultural traits show these people belonged to the Arawakan language family, a group that included the Tainos, the first Native Americans Columbus encountered. It was the largest language group that ever existed in the pre-Columbian Americas.\nAt some point, the Arawakan-speaking Ta\u00edno culture emerged in the Caribbean. Two major models have been presented to account for the arrival of Ta\u00edno ancestors in the islands; the \"Circum-Caribbean\" model suggests an origin in the Colombian Andes connected to the Arhuaco people, while the Amazonian model supports an origin in the Amazon basin, where the Arawakan languages developed. The Ta\u00edno were among the first American people to encounter Europeans. Christopher Columbus visited multiple islands and chiefdoms on his first voyage in 1492, which was followed by the establishment of La Navidad that same year on the northeast coast of Hispaniola, the first Spanish settlement in the Americas. Relationships between the Spaniards and the Ta\u00edno would ultimately sour. Some of the lower-level chiefs of the Ta\u00edno appeared to have assigned a supernatural origin to the explorers. When Columbus returned to La Navidad on his second voyage, he found the settlement burned down and the 39 men he had left there killed.\nWith the establishment of a second settlement, La Isabella, and the discovery of gold deposits on the island, the Spanish settler population on Hispaniola started to grow substantially, while disease and conflict with the Spanish began to kill tens of thousands of Ta\u00edno every year. By 1504, the Spanish had overthrown the last of the Ta\u00edno cacique chiefdoms on Hispaniola, and firmly established the supreme authority of the Spanish colonists over the now-subjugated Ta\u00edno. Over the next decade, the Spanish colonists presided over a genocide of the remaining Ta\u00edno on Hispaniola, who suffered enslavement, massacres, or exposure to diseases. The population of Hispaniola at the point of first European contact is estimated at between several hundred thousand to over a million people, but by 1514, it had dropped to a mere 35,000. By 1509, the Spanish had successfully conquered Puerto Rico and subjugated the approximately 30,000 Ta\u00edno inhabitants. By 1530, there were 1,148 Ta\u00edno left alive in Puerto Rico.\nTa\u00edno influence has survived even until today, though, as can be seen in the religions, languages, and music of Caribbean cultures. The Lokono and other South American groups resisted colonization for a longer period, and the Spanish remained unable to subdue them throughout the 16th century. In the early 17th century, they allied with the Spanish against the neighbouring Kalina (Caribs), who allied with the English and Dutch. The Lokono benefited from trade with European powers into the early 19th century, but suffered thereafter from economic and social changes in their region, including the end of the plantation economy. Their population declined until the 20th century, when it began to increase again.\nMost of the Arawak of the Antilles died out or intermarried after the Spanish conquest. In South America, Arawakan-speaking groups are widespread, from southwest Brazil to the Guianas in the north, representing a wide range of cultures. They are found mostly in the tropical forest areas north of the Amazon. As with all Amazonian native peoples, contact with European settlement has led to culture change and depopulation among these groups.\nModern population and descendants.\nLokono.\nIn the 21st century, about 10,000 Lokono live primarily in Guyana, with smaller numbers present in Venezuela, Suriname, and French Guiana. Despite colonization, the Lokono population is growing.\nIn addition, attempts to save the Lokono language, classified as critically-endangered, have been undertaken. An assessment published by Language Documentation and Conservation in 2015 determined the number of ethnic speakers who are fluent in the language had declined to approximately five percent of the known population.\nTa\u00edno.\nThe Spaniards who arrived in the Bahamas, Cuba, Hispaniola (today Haiti and the Dominican Republic), and the Virgin Islands in 1492, and later in Puerto Rico in 1493, first met the Indigenous peoples now known as the Ta\u00edno, and then the Kalinago and other groups. Some of these groups\u2014most notably the Kalinago\u2014were able to survive despite warfare, disease and slavery brought by the Europeans. Others survived in isolated communities with escaped and free Black people, called Maroons. Many of the explorers and early colonists also raped Indigenous women they came across, resulting in children who were considered mestizo. Some of these mestizo groups retained Indigenous culture and customs over many generations, especially among rural communities such as the j\u00edbaro.\nIn time, the number of recorded Ta\u00edno was greatly diminished through forced labor, disease and warfare, but also through changes to how \"Indio\" groups were recorded in the Spanish Caribbean. For example, the 1787 census in Puerto Rico lists 2,300 \"pure\" Indios in the population, but on the next census, in 1802, not a single Indio is listed. This created the enduring belief that the Ta\u00edno people went extinct, also known as the paper genocide. The paper genocide and the myth of extinction spread throughout colonial empires, Ta\u00edno people still continued to practice their culture and teachings passing it down from generation to generation. Much of this was done in secret or disguised through Catholicism in fear for their survival and of discrimination.\nWith the modern invention of DNA testing, many Caribbean people have discovered they have Indigenous heritage. This has supported the claims of individuals and communities with Ta\u00edno heritage living today, particularly in rural areas such as \"campos\" (meaning small villages/towns in the country side). Though many communities and individuals across the Caribbean have some amount of Indigenous DNA, not all of them identify as Indigenous or Ta\u00edno. Those who do identify as Indigenous Caribbean may also use other terms to describe themselves as well as or in addition to \"Ta\u00edno\".\nThere has been increasing scholarly attention paid to Ta\u00edno practices and culture, including communities with full or partial Ta\u00edno identities. Because of this, Ta\u00edno people started to become more open about sharing their identities, passed down Indigenous culture, and beliefs, such as the syncretic religion of Agua Dulce (also known as Tamani) that is practiced in the Dominican Republic. Even before the DNA confirmation in the scientific community, Ta\u00edno peoples within the Caribbean and its diasporas had started a movement around the late 1980s and early 1990s calling for the protection, revival or restoration of Ta\u00edno culture.\nBy coming together and sharing individual knowledge passed down by either oral history or maintained practice, these groups were able to use that knowledge and cross-reference the journals of Spaniards to fill in parts of Ta\u00edno culture and religion long thought to be lost due to colonization. This movement led to some Yukayekes (Ta\u00edno Tribes) being reformed.\nToday there are Yukayekes in Cuba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico, such as \"Higuayagua\" and \"Yukayeke Ta\u00edno Borik\u00e9n\". There have also been attempts to revive the Ta\u00edno language\u2014such as the Hiwatahia Hekexi dialect\u2014using words that have survived into local Spanish dialects and extrapolation from other Arawakan languages in South America to fill in lost words.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

It is the only genus in the family Cannaceae. All of the genus's species are native to the American tropics and were naturalized in Europe, India and Africa in the 1860s. Although they grow native to the tropics, most cultivars have been developed in temperate climates and are easy to grow in most countries of the world, as long as they receive at least 6\u20138 hours average sunlight during the summer, and are moved to a warm location for the winter. See the \"Canna\" cultivar gallery for photographs of \"Canna\" cultivars.\nCannas are not true lilies, but have been assigned by the APG II system of 2003 to the order Zingiberales in the monocot clade Commelinids, together with their closest relatives, the gingers, spiral gingers, bananas, arrowroots, heliconias, and birds of paradise.\nThe plants have large foliage, so horticulturists have developed selected forms as large-flowered garden plants. Cannas are also used in agriculture as a source of starch for human and animal consumption. \"C. indica\" and \"C. glauca\" have been grown into many cultivars in India and Africa.\nDescription.\nThe plants are large tropical and subtropical herbaceous perennials with a rhizomatous rootstock. The broad, flat, alternate leaves that are such a feature of these plants, grow out of a stem in a long, narrow roll and then unfurl. The leaves are typically solid green, but some cultivars have glaucose, brownish, maroon, or even variegated leaves.\nThe flowers are asymmetric and composed of three sepals and three petals that are small, inconspicuous, and hidden under extravagant stamens. What appear to be petals are the highly modified stamens or staminodes. The staminodes number (1\u2013) 3 (\u20134) (with at least one staminodal member called the labellum, always being present. A specialized staminode, the stamen, bears pollen from a half-anther. A somewhat narrower \"petal\" is the pistil, which is connected down to a three-chambered ovary.\nThe flowers are typically red, orange, or yellow, or any combination of those colours, and are aggregated in inflorescences that are spikes or panicles (thyrses). The main pollinators of the flowers are bees, hummingbirds, sunbirds, and bats. The pollination mechanism is conspicuously specialized. Pollen is shed on the style while still in the bud, and in the species and early hybrids, some is also found on the stigma because of the high position of the anther, which means that they are self-pollinating. Later cultivars have a lower anther, and rely on pollinators alighting on the labellum and touching first the terminal stigma, and then the pollen.\nThe wild species often grow to at least in height, but wide variation in size exists among cultivated plants; numerous cultivars have been selected for smaller stature.\nCannas grow from swollen underground stems, correctly known as rhizomes, which store starch, and this is the main attraction of the plant to agriculture, having the largest starch grains of all plant life.\n\"Canna\" is the only member of the Liliopsida class (monocot group) in which hibernation of seed is known to occur, due to its hard, impenetrable seed covering.\nTaxonomy.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Canna\" originates from the Latin word for a cane or reed.\n\"Canna indica\", commonly called \"achira\" in Latin America, has been cultivated by Native Americans in tropical America for thousands of years, and was one of the earliest domesticated plants in the Americas. The starchy root is edible.\nThe first species of \"Canna\" introduced to Europe was \"C. indica\", which was imported from the East Indies, though the species originated from the Americas. Charles de l'Ecluse, who first described and sketched \"C. indica\", indicated this origin, and stated that it was given the name \"indica\", not because the plant is from India, in Asia, but because this species was originally transported from America: \"Quia ex America primum delata sit\"; and at that time, one described the tropical areas of that part of the globe as the West Indies.\nMuch later, in 1658, Willem Piso made reference to another species that he documented under the vulgar or common name of 'Albara' and 'Pacivira', which resided, he said, in the \"shaded and damp places, between the tropics\"; this species is \"C. angustifolia\" L. (later reclassified as \"C. glauca\" L. by taxonomists).\nSpecies.\nAlthough most cannas grown these days are cultivars (see below), about 20 known species are of the wild form, and in the last three decades of the 20th century, \"Canna\" species have been categorized by two different taxonomists, Paul Maas, from the Netherlands and Nobuyuki Tanaka from Japan. Both reduced the number of species from the 50\u2013100 accepted previously, assigning most as synonyms.\nThis reduction in species is also confirmed by work done by Kress and Prince at the Smithsonian Institution, but this only covers a subset of the species range.\nDistribution.\nThe genus is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the New World, from the Southern United States (southern South Carolina west to southern Texas) and south to northern Argentina.\n\"C. indica\" has become naturalized in many tropical areas around the world, is a difficult plant to remove, and is invasive in some places.\n\"Canna\" cultivars are grown in most countries, even those with territory above the Arctic Circle, which have short summers, but long days, and the rapid growth rate of cannas makes them a feasible gardening plant, as long as they receive 6\u20138 hours of sunlight each day during the growing season and are protected from the cold of winter.\nEcology.\nPests.\nCannas are largely free of pests. However, in the eastern and southern United States, plants sometimes fall victim to the canna leaf roller moth, with the resultant leaf damage, while not being fatal to the plant, can be most distressing to a keen gardener's eye.\nSlugs and snails are quite fond of cannas and their large, juicy leaves, potentially leaving unsightly holes where they have chewed on the plant\u2014particularly during and after rainy periods (when mollusks become active). Slugs and snails tend to prefer tender, younger foliage, however. Red spider mites may also be a potential pest for cannas grown indoors, in dry areas, or that receive poor airflow.\nFor canna grown outside (in California or Texas, for example), mealybugs and scale insects are most drawn to the dense folds and creases between the leaves and the stem/petiole, where the foliage attaches to the plant. At times, if left unchecked, these sucking-insects may remain effectively concealed in these tight areas, only for older or dead leaves to be peeled off to reveal a small colony of white, fuzzy mealybugs congregated. Mealybugs are particularly prevalent in drier climates, such as the Southwestern US. Japanese beetles can also ravage the leaves if left uncontrolled.\nThese pests, while certainly able to drain a plant of its energy over time, and cause its eventual decline, are generally not lethal to the plant when dealt with immediately. The majority of insect pests on canna plants can be sprayed with a 70% isopropyl alcohol mist\u2014diluted slightly\u2014applied during non-sunny periods, as the alcohol may cause sunburn on the plant. Other effective options include insecticidal soap, neem and horticultural oils, and other commercially available spray treatments. Granulated systemic insecticides are also useful, and generally completely safe; when applied to the soil topically every few months, granulated or powdered systemics will prevent nearly all pest infestations (for the duration of effectiveness). Non-scented baby wipes or paper towels, moistened with rubbing alcohol or cider vinegar may be used to wipe any invisible eggs or larvae from the leaves.\nDisease.\nCannas are remarkably free of diseases, compared to many genera. However, they may fall victim to canna rust, a fungal disease resulting in orange spots on the plant's leaves, caused by over-moist soil. They are also susceptible to certain plant viruses, some of which are \"Canna\"-specific, which may result in spotted or streaked leaves, in a mild form, but can finally result in stunted growth and twisted and distorted blooms and foliage.\nThe flowers are sometimes affected by a grey, fuzzy mold called botrytis. Under humid conditions, it is often found growing on the older flowers. Treatment is to simply remove the old flowers, so the mold does not spread to the new flowers.\nCultivation.\nCannas grow best in full sun with moderate water in well-drained, rich or sandy soil. They grow from perennial rhizomes, but are frequently grown as annuals in temperate zones for an exotic or tropical look in the garden. In arid regions, cannas are often grown in the water garden, with the lower inch of pot submerged. In all areas, high winds tear the leaves, so shelter is advised.\nThe rhizomes are sensitive to frost and will rot if left unprotected in freezing conditions. In areas with winter temperatures below in the winter (&lt; USDA Zone 8b), the rhizomes can be dug up before freezing and stored (above ) for replanting in the spring. Otherwise, they should be protected by a thick layer of mulch over winter.\nUses.\nHorticultural varieties (cultivars).\nCannas became very popular in Victorian times as garden plants, and were grown widely in France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Some cultivars from this time, including a sterile hybrid, usually referred to as \"Canna\" \u00d7 \"ehemannii\", are still commercially available. \"C.\"\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0\"ehemannii\" is tall and green-leafed with terminal drooping panicles of hot pink iris-like flowers, looking somewhat like a cross between a banana and a fuchsia.\nAs tender perennials in northern climates, they suffered severe setbacks when two world wars sent the young gardening staff off to war. The genus \"Canna\" has recently experienced a renewed interest and revival in popularity. Once, hundreds of cultivars existed, but many are now extinct. In 1910, \u00c1rp\u00e4d M\u00fchle, from Hungary, published his \"Canna\" book, written in German. It contained descriptions of over 500 cultivars.\nIn recent years, many new cultivars have been created, but the genus suffers severely from having many synonyms for many popular ones. Most of the synonyms were created by old varieties resurfacing without viable names, with the increase in popularity from the 1960s onwards. Research has accumulated over 2,800 \"Canna\" cultivar names, but many of these are simply synonyms. See List of \"Canna\" hybridists for details of the people and firms that created the current \"Canna\" legacy.\nIn the early 20th century, Professor Liberty Hyde Bailey defined, in detail, two \"garden species\" (\"C.\" \u00d7 \"generalis\" and \"C.\" \u00d7 \"orchiodes\") to categorise the floriferous cannas being grown at that time, namely the Crozy hybrids and the orchid-like hybrids introduced by Carl Ludwig Sprenger in Italy and Luther Burbank in the U.S., at about the same time (1894). The definition was based on the genotype, rather than the phenotype, of the two cultivar groups. Inevitably over time, those two floriferous groups were interbred, the distinctions became blurred and overlapped, and the Bailey species names became redundant. Pseudo-species names are now deprecated by the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants which, instead, provides cultivar groups for categorising cultivars (see groups at List of \"Canna\" cultivars).\nAGM cultivars.\nThese canna cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nAgricultural varieties.\nThe Canna Agriculture Group contains all of the varieties of \"Canna\" grown in agriculture. \"Canna achira\" is a generic term used in South America to describe the cannas that have been selectively bred for agricultural purposes, normally derived from \"C. discolor\". It is grown especially for its edible rootstock from which starch is obtained, but the leaves and young seeds are also edible, and achira was once a staple food crop in Peru and Ecuador. Trials in Ecuador using a wide range of varieties have shown that achira can yield on average 56 tons of rhizomes and 7.8 tons of extractable starch per hectare. However, the crop needs 9\u201312 months to mature to full productivity.\nMany more traditional kinds exist worldwide; they have all involved human selection, so are classified as agricultural cultivars. Traditionally, \"Canna edulis\" Ker Gawl. has been reputed to be the species grown for food in South America, but \"C. edulis\" probably is simply a synonym of \"C. discolor\", which is also grown for agricultural purposes throughout Asia.\nPropagation.\nSexual propagation.\nSeeds are produced from sexual reproduction, involving the transfer of pollen from the stamen of the pollen parent onto the stigma of the seed parent. In the case of \"Canna\", the same plant can usually play the roles of both pollen and seed parents, technically referred to as a hermaphrodite. However, the cultivars of the Italian group and triploids are almost always seed sterile, and their pollen has a low fertility level. Mutations are almost always totally sterile.\n\"Canna\" seeds have a very hard seed coat, which contributes to their dormancy. Germination is facilitated by scarification of the seed coat, which can be accomplished by several techniques.\nThe species are capable of self-pollination, but most cultivars require an outside pollinator. All cannas produce nectar, so attract nectar-consuming insects, bats, and hummingbirds, that act as the transfer agent, spreading pollen between stamens and stigmas on the same or different flowers.\nSince genetic recombination has occurred, a cultivar grown from seed will have different characteristics from its parent(s), thus should never be given a parent's name. The wild species have evolved in the absence of other \"Canna\" genes and are usually true to type when the parents are of the same species, but a degree of variance still occurs. The species \"C. indica\" is an aggregate species, having many different and extreme forms ranging from the giant to miniature, from large foliage to small foliage, both green and dark foliage, and many differently coloured blooms of red, orange, pink, or yellow, and combinations of those colours.\nAsexual propagation.\nOutside of a laboratory, the only effective asexual propagation method is rhizome division. This uses material from a single parent, and as no exchange of genetic material occurs, it almost always produces plants that are identical to the parent. After a summer's growth, the horticultural cultivars can be separated into typically four or five separate smaller rhizomes, each with a growing nodal point (growing eye). Without the growing point, which is composed of meristem material, the rhizome will not grow.\nMicropropagation, also known as tissue culture, is the practice of rapidly multiplying stock plant material to produce a large number of progeny plants. Micropropagation uses \"in vitro\" division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the \"Island Series\" of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult micropropagation candidates.\nMicropropagation techniques can be employed to disinfest plants of a virus. In the growing tip of a plant, cell division is so rapid that the younger cells may not have had time to be infected with the virus. The rapidly growing region of meristem cells producing the shoot tip is cut off and placed \"in vitro\", with a very high probability of being uncontaminated by virus.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nGeneral and cited references.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He is one of America's most renowned artists and known for his skill in depicting modern American life and landscapes.\nBorn in Nyack, New York, to a middle-class family, Hopper's early interest in art was supported by his parents. He studied at the New York School of Art under William Merritt Chase and Robert Henri, where he developed a signature style characterized by its emphasis on solitude, light, and shadow.\nHopper's work, spanning oil paintings, watercolors, and etchings, predominantly explores themes of loneliness and isolation within American urban and rural settings. His most famous painting, \"Nighthawks\" (1942), exemplifies his focus on quiet, introspective scenes from everyday life. Though his career advanced slowly, Hopper achieved recognition by the 1920s, with his works featured in major American museums. Hopper's technique, marked by a composition of form and use of light to evoke mood, has been influential in the art world and popular culture. His paintings, often set in the architectural landscapes of New York or the serene environments of New England, convey a sense of narrative depth and emotional resonance, making him a pivotal figure in American Realism. Hopper created subdued drama out of commonplace subjects layered with a poetic meaning, inviting narrative interpretations. He was praised for \"complete verity\" in the America he portrayed.\nIn 1924, Hopper married fellow artist Josephine Nivison, who played a significant role in managing his career and modeling for many of his works. The couple lived modestly in New York City and spent summers on Cape Cod, which influenced much of Hopper's later art. Despite critical acclaim, Hopper remained private and introspective, dedicated to exploring the subtleties of human experience and the American landscape. His depiction of American life, with its emphasis on isolation and contemplation, remains a defining aspect of his appeal and significance in the history of American art.\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nHopper was born in 1882 in Nyack, New York, a yacht-building center on the Hudson River north of New York City. He was one of two children of a comfortably well-off family. His parents, of mostly Dutch ancestry, were Elizabeth Griffiths Smith and Garret Henry Hopper, a dry-goods merchant. Although not as successful as his forebears, Garret provided well for his two children with considerable help from his wife's inheritance. He retired at age forty-nine. Edward and his sister, Marion, attended both private and public schools. They were raised in a strict Baptist home. His father had a mild nature, and the household was dominated by women: Hopper's mother, grandmother, sister, and maid.\nHis birthplace and boyhood home was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. It is now operated as the Edward Hopper House Museum &amp; Study Center, serving as a nonprofit community cultural center featuring exhibitions, workshops, lectures, performances, and special events.\nHopper was a good student in grade school, and by the time he was five his talent with drawing was already apparent. He readily absorbed his father's intellectual tendencies and love of French and Russian cultures. He also demonstrated his mother's artistic heritage. Hopper's parents encouraged his art and kept him amply supplied with materials, instructional magazines, and illustrated books.\nHopper first began signing and dating his drawings at the age of 10. Among the earliest of these drawings are charcoal sketches of geometric shapes, a vase, bowl, cup, and boxes. The detailed examination of light and shadow that continued throughout his career is already visible in these early works. By his teens, he was working in pen-and-ink, charcoal, watercolor, and oil\u2014drawing from nature while also making political cartoons. In 1895, he created his first signed oil painting, \"Rowboat in Rocky Cove\", which he copied from a reproduction in \"The Art Interchange\", a popular journal for amateur artists. Hopper's other earliest oils, such as \"Old ice pond at Nyack\" and his c.1898 painting \"Ships,\" have been identified as copies of paintings by artists including Bruce Crane and Edward Moran.\nIn his early self-portraits, Hopper tended to represent himself as skinny, ungraceful, and homely. Though a tall and quiet teenager, his prankish sense of humor found outlet in his art, sometimes in depictions of immigrants or of women dominating men in comical situations. Later in life, he mostly depicted women as the figures in his paintings. In high school (he graduated from Nyack High School in 1899), he carved wooden models of sailboats and barges and dreamed of becoming a naval architect, but after graduation declared his intention to pursue a career in art. Hopper's parents insisted that he study commercial art to have a reliable means of income. In developing his self-image and individualistic philosophy of life, Hopper was influenced by the writings of Ralph Waldo Emerson. He later said, \"I admire him greatly...I read him over and over again.\"\nHopper began art studies through a correspondence course in 1899. Soon he transferred to the New York School of Art and Design, the forerunner of Parsons School of Design. There, he studied for six years with teachers including William Merritt Chase, who instructed him in oil painting. Early on, Hopper modeled his style after Chase and French Impressionist masters \u00c9douard Manet and Edgar Degas. Sketching from live models, however, proved challenging and somewhat shocking for the conservatively raised Hopper.\nAnother of his teachers, artist Robert Henri, taught life class. Henri encouraged his students to use their art to \"make a stir in the world.\" He also advised his students, \"It isn't the subject that counts but what you feel about it\" and \"Forget about art and paint pictures of what interests you in life.\" In this manner, Henri influenced Hopper, as well as future artists George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. He encouraged them to imbue their work with a modern spirit. Some artists in Henri's circle, including John Sloan, became members of \"The Eight\", also known as the Ashcan School of American Art. Hopper's first surviving oil painting to hint at his use of interiors as a theme was \"Solitary Figure in a Theater\" (c.1904). During his student years, he also painted dozens of nudes, still life studies, landscapes, and portraits, including self-portraits.\nIn 1905, Hopper landed a part-time job with an advertising agency, where he created cover designs for trade magazines. Hopper came to detest illustration. He was bound to it by economic necessity until the mid-1920s. He temporarily escaped by making three trips to Europe, each centered in Paris, ostensibly to study its art scene. In fact, he mostly worked alone and seemed mostly unaffected by the new currents in art. Later, he said he didn't \"remember hearing of Picasso at all\". He was highly impressed by Rembrandt, particularly his \"Night Watch\", which he said was \"the most wonderful thing of his I have seen; it's past belief in its reality.\"\nHopper began painting urban and architectural scenes in a dark palette. Then he shifted to the lighter shades of the Impressionists before returning to the darker palette, with which he was most comfortable. He later said, \"I got over that and later things done in Paris were more the kind of things I do now.\" Hopper spent much of his time drawing street and caf\u00e9 scenes, and going to the theater and opera. Unlike many of his contemporaries who imitated the abstract cubist experiments, Hopper was attracted to realist art. Later, he claimed few European influences other than Rembrandt, Goya and the French engraver Charles Meryon whose moody Paris scenes Hopper imitated.\nYears of struggle.\nAfter returning from his last European trip, Hopper rented a studio in New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had to knock on the doors of magazine and agency offices to find business. His painting languished: \"it's hard for me to decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly.\" His fellow illustrator Walter Tittle described Hopper's depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend \"suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting for days at a time before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell.\"\nFrom February 22 to March 5, 1912, he was included in the exhibition of The Independents, a group of artists at the initiative of Robert Henri but did not make any sales.\nIn 1912, Hopper traveled to Gloucester, Massachusetts, to seek some inspiration and made his first outdoor paintings in America. He painted \"Squam Light\", the first of many lighthouse paintings to come.\nIn 1913, at the Armory Show, Hopper earned $250 when he sold his first painting, \"Sailing\" (1911), to an American businessman Thomas F. Vietor, which he had painted over an earlier self-portrait. Hopper was thirty-one, and although he hoped his first sale would lead to others in short order, his career would not catch on for many more years. He continued to participate in group exhibitions at smaller venues, such as the MacDowell Club of New York. Shortly after his father's death that same year, Hopper moved to the 3 Washington Square North apartment in the Greenwich Village section of Manhattan, where he would live for the rest of his life.\nThe following year, he received a commission to create some movie posters and handle publicity for a movie company. Although he did not like the illustration work, Hopper was a lifelong devotee of the cinema and the theatre, both of which he treated as subjects for his paintings. Each form influenced his compositional methods.\nAt an impasse over his oil paintings, in 1915 Hopper turned to etching. By 1923 he had produced most of his approximately 70 works in this medium, many of urban scenes of both Paris and New York. He also produced some posters for the war effort, as well as continuing with occasional commercial projects. When he could, Hopper did some outdoor oil paintings on visits to New England, especially at the art colonies at Ogunquit, and Monhegan Island.\nDuring the early 1920s his etchings began to receive public recognition. They expressed some of his later themes, as in \"Night on the El Train\" (couples in silence), \"Evening Wind\" (solitary female), and \"The Catboat\" (simple nautical scene). Two notable oil paintings of this time were \"New York Interior\" (1921) and \"New York Restaurant\" (1922). He also painted two of his many \"window\" paintings to come: \"Girl at Sewing Machine\" and \"Moonlight Interior\", both of which show a figure (clothed or nude) near a window of an apartment viewed as gazing out or from the point of view from the outside looking in.\nAlthough these were frustrating years, Hopper gained some recognition. In 1918, Hopper was awarded the U.S. Shipping Board Prize for his war poster, \"Smash the Hun\". He participated in three exhibitions: in 1917 with the Society of Independent Artists, in January 1920 (a one-man exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club, which was the precursor to the Whitney Museum), and in 1922 (again with the Whitney Studio Club). In 1923, Hopper received two awards for his etchings: the Logan Prize from the Chicago Society of Etchers, and the W.\u00a0A. Bryan Prize.\nMarriage and breakthrough.\nBy 1923, Hopper's slow climb finally produced a breakthrough. He re-encountered Josephine Nivison, an artist and former student of Robert Henri, during a summer painting trip in Gloucester, Massachusetts. They were opposites: she was short, open, gregarious, sociable, and liberal, while he was tall, secretive, shy, quiet, introspective, and conservative. With Jo's encouragement, Hopper turned to the medium of watercolor, producing numerous scenes of Gloucester. They married a year later with artist Guy P\u00e8ne du Bois as their best man. Nivison once remarked: \"Sometimes talking to Eddie is just like dropping a stone in a well, except that it doesn't thump when it hits bottom.\" She subordinated her career to his and shared his reclusive lifestyle. The rest of their lives revolved around their spare walk-up apartment in the city and their summers in South Truro on Cape Cod. She managed his career and his interviews, was his primary model, and was his life companion.\nWith Nivison's help, six of Hopper's Gloucester watercolors were admitted to an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum in 1923. One of them, \"The Mansard Roof\", was purchased by the museum for its permanent collection for the sum of $100. The critics generally raved about his work; one stated, \"What vitality, force and directness! Observe what can be done with the homeliest subject.\" Hopper sold all his watercolors at a one-man show the following year and finally decided to put illustration behind him.\nThe artist had demonstrated his ability to transfer his attraction to Parisian architecture to American urban and rural architecture. According to Boston Museum of Fine Arts curator Carol Troyen, \"Hopper really liked the way these houses, with their turrets and towers and porches and mansard roofs and ornament cast wonderful shadows. Hopper always said that his favorite thing was painting sunlight on the side of a house.\"\nAt forty-one, Hopper received further recognition for his work. He continued to harbor bitterness about his career, later turning down appearances and awards. With his financial stability secured by steady sales, Hopper would live a simple, stable life and continue creating art in his personal style for four more decades.\nHis \"Two on the Aisle\" (1927) sold for a personal record $1,500, enabling Hopper to purchase an automobile, which he used to make field trips to remote areas of New England. In 1929, he produced \"Chop Suey\" and \"Railroad Sunset\". The following year, art patron Stephen Clark donated \"House by the Railroad\" (1925) to the Museum of Modern Art, the first oil painting that it acquired for its collection. Hopper painted his last self-portrait in oil around 1930. Although Josephine posed for many of his paintings, she sat for only one formal oil portrait by her husband, \"Jo Painting\" (1936).\nHopper fared better than many other artists during the Great Depression. His stature took a sharp rise in 1931 when major museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, paid thousands of dollars for his works. He sold 30 paintings that year, including 13 watercolors. The following year he participated in the first Whitney Annual, and he continued to exhibit in every annual at the museum for the rest of his life. In 1933, the Museum of Modern Art gave Hopper his first large-scale retrospective.\nIn 1930, the Hoppers rented a cottage in South Truro, on Cape Cod. They returned every summer for the rest of their lives, building a summer house there in 1934. From there, they would take driving trips into other areas when Hopper needed to search for fresh material to paint. In the summers of 1937 and 1938, the couple spent extended sojourns on Wagon Wheels Farm in South Royalton, Vermont, where Hopper painted a series of watercolors along the White River. These scenes are atypical among Hopper's mature works, as most are \"pure\" landscapes, devoid of architecture or human figures. \"First Branch of the White River\" (1938), now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is the best-known of Hopper's Vermont landscapes.\nHopper was very productive through the 1930s and early 1940s, producing among many important works \"New York Movie\" (1939), \"Girlie Show\" (1941), \"Nighthawks\" (1942), \"Hotel Lobby\" (1943), and \"Morning in a City\" (1944). During the late 1940s, however, he suffered a period of relative inactivity. He admitted: \"I wish I could paint more. I get sick of reading and going to the movies.\" During the next two decades, his health faltered, and he had several prostate surgeries and other medical problems. But, in the 1950s and early 1960s, he created several more major works, including \"First Row Orchestra\" (1951); as well as \"Morning Sun\" and \"Hotel by a Railroad\", both in 1952; and \"Intermission\" in 1963.\nIn 1966, Hopper was awarded The Edward MacDowell Medal by The MacDowell Colony for outstanding contributions to American culture.\nDeath.\nHopper died of natural causes in his studio near Washington Square in New York City on May 15, 1967. He was buried two days later in the family plot at Oak Hill Cemetery in Nyack, New York, his place of birth. His wife died ten months later and is buried with him.\nEdward Hopper's wife, Josephine, bequeathed their joint collection of over three thousand pieces to the Whitney Museum. Arthayer Sanborn, a Baptist minister who frequently visited their home to care for Edward's sister, Marion, came into possession of three hundred Hopper drawings and paintings. Art historian Gail Levin has highlighted that whereas the Whitney Museum has extensive documentation of how Josephine distributed their couple's pieces, paintings acquired from Sanborn lack provenance proving the family willingly gifted the trove of pieces Sanborn reported finding in their attic. The Museum of Modern Art in New York, Des Moines Art Center, and Art Institute of Chicago all have significant collections of Hopper paintings.\nArt.\nPersonality and vision.\nAlways reluctant to discuss himself and his art, Hopper simply said, \"The whole answer is there on the canvas.\" Hopper was stoic and fatalistic\u2014a quiet introverted man with a gentle sense of humor and a frank manner. Hopper was someone drawn to an emblematic, anti-narrative symbolism, who \"painted short isolated moments of configuration, saturated with suggestion\". His silent spaces and uneasy encounters \"touch us where we are most vulnerable\", and have \"a suggestion of melancholy, that melancholy being enacted\". His sense of color revealed him as a pure painter, as he \"turned the Puritan into the purist, in his quiet canvasses where blemishes and blessings balance\". According to critic Lloyd Goodrich, he was \"an eminently native painter, who more than any other was getting more of the quality of America into his canvases\".\nConservative in politics and social matters (Hopper asserted for example that \"artists' lives should be written by people very close to them\"), he accepted things as they were and displayed a lack of idealism. Cultured and sophisticated, he was well-read, and many of his paintings show figures reading. He was generally good company and unperturbed by silences, though sometimes taciturn, grumpy, or detached. He was always serious about his art and the art of others, and when asked would return frank opinions.\nHopper's most systematic declaration of his philosophy as an artist was given in a handwritten note, titled \"Statement\", submitted in 1953 to the journal \"Reality\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Great art is the outward expression of an inner life in the artist, and this inner life will result in his personal vision of the world. No amount of skillful invention can replace the essential element of imagination. One of the weaknesses of much abstract painting is the attempt to substitute the inventions of the human intellect for a private imaginative conception.\nThe inner life of a human being is a vast and varied realm and does not concern itself alone with stimulating arrangements of color, form and design.\nThe term life used in art is something not to be held in contempt, for it implies all of existence and the province of art is to react to it and not to shun it.\nPainting will have to deal more fully and less obliquely with life and nature's phenomena before it can again become great.\u2014\u200a\nThough Hopper claimed that he didn't consciously embed psychological meaning in his paintings, he was deeply interested in Freud and the power of the subconscious mind. He wrote in 1939: \"So much of every art is an expression of the subconscious that it seems to me most of all the important qualities are put there unconsciously, and little of importance by the conscious intellect.\"\nMethods.\nAlthough he is best known for his oil paintings, Hopper initially achieved recognition for his watercolors, and he also produced some commercially successful etchings. Additionally, his notebooks contain high-quality pen and pencil sketches, which were never meant for public viewing.\nHopper paid particular attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, \"It takes a long time for an idea to strike. Then I have to think about it for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel\". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as \"sad face of woman unlit\", \"electric light from ceiling\", and \"thighs cooler\".\nFor \"New York Movie\" (1939), Hopper demonstrated his thorough preparation with more than 53 sketches of the theater interior and the figure of the pensive usherette.\nThe effective use of light and shadow to create mood is also central to Hopper's methods. Bright sunlight (as an emblem of insight or revelation), and the shadows it casts, play symbolically powerful roles in Hopper paintings such as \"Early Sunday Morning\" (1930), \"Summertime\" (1943), \"Seven A.M.\" (1948), and \"Sun in an Empty Room\" (1963). His use of light and shadow effects has been compared to the cinematography of film noir.\nAlthough a realist painter, Hopper's \"soft\" realism simplified shapes and details. He used saturated color to heighten contrast and create mood.\nSubjects and themes.\nHopper derived his subject matter from two primary sources: the common features of American life (such as gas stations, motels, restaurants, theaters, railroads, and street scenes) and their inhabitants; and seascapes and rural landscapes. Regarding his style, Hopper defined himself as \"an amalgam of many races\" and not a member of any school, particularly the \"Ashcan School\". Once Hopper achieved his mature style, his art remained consistent and self-contained, despite the numerous art trends that came and went during his long career.\nHopper's seascapes fall into three main groups: pure landscapes of rocks, sea, and beach grass; lighthouses and farmhouses; and sailboats. Sometimes he combined these elements. Most of these paintings depict strong light and fair weather; he showed little interest in snow or rain scenes, or in seasonal color changes. He painted the majority of the pure seascapes between 1916 and 1919 on Monhegan Island. Hopper's \"The Long Leg\" (1935) is a nearly all-blue sailing picture with the simplest of elements, while his \"Ground Swell\" (1939) is more complex and depicts a group of youngsters out for a sail, a theme reminiscent of Winslow Homer's iconic \"Breezing Up (A Fair Wind)\" (1876).\nUrban architecture and cityscapes were also major subjects for Hopper. He was fascinated with the American urban scene, \"our native architecture with its hideous beauty, its fantastic roofs, pseudo-gothic, French Mansard, Colonial, mongrel or what not, with eye-searing color or delicate harmonies of faded paint, shouldering one another along interminable streets that taper off into swamps or dump heaps.\"\nIn 1925, he produced \"House by the Railroad\". This classic work depicts an isolated Victorian wood mansion, partly obscured by the raised embankment of a railroad. It marked Hopper's artistic maturity. Lloyd Goodrich praised the work as \"one of the most poignant and desolating pieces of realism\". The work is the first of a series of stark rural and urban scenes that use sharp lines and large shapes, played upon by unusual lighting to capture the lonely mood of his subjects. Although critics and viewers interpret meaning and mood in these cityscapes, Hopper insisted, \"I was more interested in the sunlight on the buildings and on the figures than any symbolism.\" As if to prove the point, his late painting \"Sun in an Empty Room\" (1963) is a pure study of sunlight.\nMost of Hopper's figure paintings focus on the subtle interaction of human beings with their environment\u2014carried out with solo figures, couples, or groups. His primary emotional themes are solitude, loneliness, regret, boredom, and resignation. He expresses these emotions in various environments, including the office, in public places, in apartments, on the road, or on vacation. As if he were creating stills for a movie or tableaux in a play, Hopper positioned his characters as if they were captured just before or just after the climax of a scene.\nHopper's solitary figures are mostly women\u2014dressed, semi-clad, and nude\u2014often reading or looking out a window, or in the workplace. In the early 1920s, Hopper painted his first such images: \"Girl at Sewing Machine\" (1921), \"New York Interior\" (another woman sewing) (1921), and \"Moonlight Interior\" (a nude getting into bed) (1923). \"Automat\" (1927) and \"Hotel Room\" (1931), however, are more representative of his mature style, emphasizing solitude more overtly.\nAs Hopper scholar Gail Levin wrote of \"Hotel Room\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The spare vertical and diagonal bands of color and sharp electric shadows create a concise and intense drama in the night... Combining poignant subject matter with such a powerful formal arrangement, Hopper's composition is pure enough to approach an almost abstract sensibility, yet layered with a poetic meaning for the observer.\nHopper's \"Room in New York\" (1932) and \"Cape Cod Evening\" (1939) are prime examples of his \"couple\" paintings. In the first, a young couple appear alienated and uncommunicative\u2014he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes on the role of a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with \"Excursion into Philosophy\" (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly on the edge of a bed. Beside him lies an open book and a partially clad woman. A shaft of light illuminates the floor in front of him. Jo Hopper noted in their log book, \"[T]he open book is Plato, reread too late\".\nLevin interprets the painting:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Plato's philosopher, in search of the real and the true, must turn away from this transitory realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain of thinking about this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.\nIn \"Office at Night\" (1940), another \"couple\" painting, Hopper creates a psychological puzzle. The painting shows a man focusing on his work papers, while nearby his attractive female secretary pulls a file. Several studies for the painting show how Hopper experimented with the positioning of the two figures, perhaps to heighten the eroticism and the tension. Hopper presents the viewer with the possibilities that the man is either truly uninterested in the woman's appeal or that he is working hard to ignore her. Another interesting aspect of the painting is how Hopper employs three light sources, from a desk lamp, through a window and indirect light from above. Hopper went on to make several \"office\" pictures, but no others with a sensual undercurrent.\nThe best-known of Hopper's paintings, \"Nighthawks\" (1942), is one of his paintings of groups. It shows customers sitting at the counter of an all-night diner. The shapes and diagonals are carefully constructed. The viewpoint is cinematic\u2014from the sidewalk, as if the viewer were approaching the restaurant. The diner's harsh electric light sets it apart from the dark night outside, enhancing the mood and subtle emotion. As in many Hopper paintings, the interaction is minimal. The restaurant depicted was inspired by one in Greenwich Village. Both Hopper and his wife posed for the figures, and Jo Hopper gave the painting its title. The inspiration for the picture may have come from Ernest Hemingway's short story \"The Killers\", which Hopper greatly admired, or from the more philosophical \"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place\". The mood of the painting has sometimes been interpreted as an expression of wartime anxiety. In keeping with the title of his painting, Hopper later said, \"Nighthawks\" has more to do with the possibility of predators in the night than with loneliness.\nHis second most recognizable painting after \"Nighthawks\" is another urban painting, \"Early Sunday Morning\" (originally called \"Seventh Avenue Shops\"), which shows an empty street scene in sharp side light, with a fire hydrant and a barber pole as stand-ins for human figures. Originally Hopper intended to put figures in the upstairs windows but left them empty to heighten the feeling of desolation.\nHopper's rural New England scenes, such as \"Gas\" (1940), are no less meaningful. \"Gas\" represents \"a different, equally clean, well-lighted refuge ... ke[pt] open for those in need as they navigate the night, traveling their own miles to go before they sleep.\" The work presents a fusion of several Hopper themes: the solitary figure, the melancholy of dusk, and the lonely road.\nHopper's \"Rooms by the Sea\" (1951), shows an open door with a view of the ocean, without an apparent ladder or steps and no indication of a beach.\nAfter his student years, Hopper's nudes were all women. Unlike past artists who painted the female nude to glorify the female form and to highlight female eroticism, Hopper's nudes are solitary women who are psychologically exposed. One audacious exception is \"Girlie Show\" (1941), where a red-headed strip-tease queen strides confidently across a stage to the accompaniment of the musicians in the pit. \"Girlie Show\" was inspired by Hopper's visit to a burlesque show a few days earlier. Hopper's wife, as usual, posed for him for the painting, and noted in her diary, \"Ed beginning a new canvas\u2014a burlesque queen doing a strip tease\u2014and I posing without a stitch on in front of the stove\u2014nothing but high heels in a lottery dance pose.\"\nHopper's portraits and self-portraits were relatively few after his student years. Hopper did produce a commissioned \"portrait\" of a house, \"The MacArthurs' Home\" (1939), where he faithfully details the Victorian architecture of the home of actress Helen Hayes. She reported later, \"I guess I never met a more misanthropic, grumpy individual in my life.\" Hopper grumbled throughout the project and never again accepted a commission. Hopper also painted \"Portrait of Orleans\" (1950), a \"portrait\" of the Cape Cod town from its main street.\nThough very interested in the American Civil War and Mathew Brady's battlefield photographs, Hopper made only two historical paintings. Both depicted soldiers on their way to Gettysburg. Also rare among his themes are paintings showing action. The best example of an action painting is \"Bridle Path\" (1939), but Hopper's struggle with the proper anatomy of the horses may have discouraged him from similar attempts.\nHopper's final oil painting, \"Two Comedians\" (1966), painted one year before his death, focuses on his love of the theater. Two French pantomime actors, one male and one female, both dressed in bright white costumes, take their bow in front of a darkened stage. Jo Hopper confirmed that her husband intended the figures to suggest they are taking their life's last bows together as husband and wife.\nHopper's paintings have often been seen by others as having a narrative or thematic content that the artist may not have intended. Much meaning can be added to a painting by its title, but the titles of Hopper's paintings were sometimes chosen by others, or were selected by Hopper and his wife in a way that makes it unclear whether they have any real connection with the artist's meaning. For example, Hopper once told an interviewer that he was \"fond of \"Early Sunday Morning\"... but it wasn't necessarily Sunday. That word was tacked on later by someone else.\"\nThe tendency to read thematic or narrative content into Hopper's paintings, that Hopper had not intended, extended even to his wife. When Jo Hopper commented on the figure in \"Cape Cod Morning\" \"It's a woman looking out to see if the weather's good enough to hang out her wash,\" Hopper retorted, \"Did I say that? You're making it Norman Rockwell. From my point of view she's just looking out the window.\"\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Hopper's \"Summer Evening\", a young couple talking in the harsh light of a cottage porch, is inescapably romantic, but Hopper was hurt by one critic's suggestion that it would do for an illustration in \"any woman's magazine.\" Hopper had the painting in the back of his head \"for 20 years and I never thought of putting the figures in until I actually started last summer. Why any art director would tear the picture apart. The figures were not what interested me; it was the light streaming down, and the night all around.\"\u2014\u200a\nPlace in American art.\nIn focusing primarily on quiet moments, very rarely showing action, Hopper employed a form of realism adopted by another leading American realist, Andrew Wyeth, but Hopper's technique was completely different from Wyeth's hyper-detailed style. In league with some of his contemporaries, Hopper shared his urban sensibility with John Sloan and George Bellows but avoided their overt action and violence. Where Joseph Stella and Georgia O'Keeffe glamorized the monumental structures of the city, Hopper reduced them to everyday geometrics and he depicted the pulse of the city as desolate and dangerous rather than \"elegant or seductive\".\nCharles Burchfield, whom Hopper admired and to whom he was compared, said of Hopper, \"he achieves such a complete verity that you can read into his interpretations of houses and conceptions of New York life any human implications you wish.\" He also attributed Hopper's success to his \"bold individualism. ... In him we have regained that sturdy American independence which Thomas Eakins gave us, but which for a time was lost.\" Hopper considered this a high compliment since he considered Eakins the greatest American painter.\nHopper scholar Deborah Lyons writes, \"Our own moments of revelation are often mirrored, transcendent, in his work. Once seen, Hopper's interpretations exist in our consciousness in tandem with our own experience. We forever see a certain type of house as a Hopper house, invested perhaps with a mystery that Hopper implanted in our own vision.\" Hopper's paintings highlight the seemingly mundane and typical scenes in our everyday life and give them cause for epiphany. In this way Hopper's art takes the gritty American landscape and lonely gas stations and creates within them a sense of beautiful anticipation.\nAlthough compared to his contemporary Norman Rockwell in terms of subject matter, Hopper did not like the comparison. Hopper considered himself more subtle, less illustrative, and certainly not sentimental. Hopper also rejected comparisons with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton stating \"I think the American Scene painters caricatured America. I always wanted to do myself.\"\nInfluence.\nHopper's influence on the art world and pop culture is undeniable; see for numerous examples. Though he had no formal students, many artists have cited him as an influence, including Willem de Kooning, Jim Dine, and Mark Rothko. An illustration of Hopper's influence is Rothko's early work \"Composition I\" (c. 1931), which is a direct paraphrase of Hopper's \"Chop Suey\".\nHopper's cinematic compositions and dramatic use of light and dark have made him a favorite among filmmakers. For example, \"House by the Railroad\" is reported to have heavily influenced the iconic house in the Alfred Hitchcock film \"Psycho\". The same painting has also been cited as being an influence on the home in the Terrence Malick film \"Days of Heaven\". The 1981 film \"Pennies from Heaven\" includes a tableau vivant of \"Nighthawks\", with the lead actors in the places of the diners. German director Wim Wenders also cites Hopper influence. His 1997 film \"The End of Violence\" also incorporates a tableau vivant of \"Nighthawks\", recreated by actors. Noted surrealist horror film director Dario Argento went so far as to recreate the diner and the patrons in \"Nighthawks\" as part of a set for his 1976 film \"Deep Red\" (aka \"Profondo Rosso\"). Ridley Scott has cited the same painting as a visual inspiration for \"Blade Runner\". To establish the lighting of scenes in the 2002 film \"Road to Perdition\", director Sam Mendes drew from the paintings of Hopper as a source of inspiration, particularly \"New York Movie\". The Austrian filmmaker Gustav Deutsch based a movie on 13 of Hopper's paintings.\nHomages to \"Nighthawks\" featuring cartoon characters or famous pop culture icons such as James Dean and Marilyn Monroe are often found in poster stores and gift shops. The cable television channel Turner Classic Movies sometimes runs animated clips based on Hopper paintings prior to airing its films. Musical influences include singer-songwriter Tom Waits's 1975 live-in-the-studio album titled \"Nighthawks at the Diner\", after the painting. In 1993, Madonna was inspired sufficiently by Hopper's 1941 painting \"Girlie Show\" that she named her world tour after it and incorporated many of the theatrical elements and mood of the painting into the show. In 2004, British guitarist John Squire (formerly of The Stone Roses) released a concept album based on Hopper's work entitled \"Marshall's House\". Each song on the album is inspired by, and shares its title with, a painting by Hopper. Canadian rock group The Weakerthans released their album Reunion Tour in 2007 featuring two songs inspired by and named after Hopper paintings, \"Sun in an Empty Room\", and \"Night Windows\", and have also referenced him in songs such as \"Hospital Vespers\". Hopper's \"Compartment C, Car 293\" inspired Polish composer Pawe\u0142 Szyma\u0144ski's \"Compartment 2, Car 7\" for violin, viola, cello and vibraphone (2003), as well as Hubert-F\u00e9lix Thi\u00e9faine's song \"Compartiment C Voiture 293 Edward Hopper 1938\" (2011). Hopper's work has influenced multiple recordings by British band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. \"Early Sunday Morning\" was the inspiration for the sleeve of \"Crush\" (1985). The same band's 2013 single \"Night Caf\u00e9\" was influenced by \"Nighthawks\" and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.\nIn poetry, numerous poems have been inspired by Hopper's paintings, typically as vivid descriptions and dramatizations; this genre is known as ekphrasis. In addition to numerous individual poems inspired by Hopper, several poets have written collections based on Hopper's paintings. The French poet Claude Esteban wrote a collection of prose poems, \"\" (\"Sun in an Empty room\", 1991), based on forty-seven Hopper paintings from between 1921 and 1963, ending with \"Sun in an Empty room\" (1963), hence the title. The poems each dramatized a Hopper painting, imagining a story behind the scene; the book won the Prix France Culture prize in 1991. Eight of the poems \u2013 \"Ground Swell\", \"Girl at Sewing Machine\", \"Compartment C, Car 293\", \"Nighthawks\", \"South Carolina Morning\", \"House by the Railroad\", \"People in the Sun\", and \"Roofs of Washington Square\" \u2013 were subsequently set to music by composer Graciane Finzi, and recorded with reading by the singer Natalie Dessay on her album \"Portraits of America\" (2016), where they were supplemented by selecting ten additional Hopper paintings, and songs from the American songbook to go with them. Similarly, the Spanish poet Ernest Farr\u00e9s wrote a collection of fifty-one poems in Catalan, under the name \"Edward Hopper\" (2006, English translation 2010 by Lawrence Venuti), and James Hoggard wrote \"Triangles of Light: The Edward Hopper Poems\" (Wings Press, 2009). A collection by various poets was organized in \"The Poetry of Solitude: A Tribute to Edward Hopper\" 1995 (editor Gail Levin). Individual poems include Byron Vazakas (1957) and John Stone (1985) inspired by \"Early Sunday Morning\", and Mary Leader inspired by \"Girl at Sewing Machine\".\nThe 2016 anthology \"In Sunlight or in Shadow\" was edited by Lawrence Block and contains 17 short stories inspired by Hopper paintings, each by a different author. It includes \"The Music Room\" by Stephen King which was inspired by \"Room in New York\".\nExhibitions.\nIn 1980, the show \"Edward Hopper: The Art and the Artist\" opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art and toured to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Tate Gallery in London, the Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf, and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. It was the first major retrospective to present Hopper's oil paintings alongside his preparatory sketches and drawings.\nIn 2004, a large selection of Hopper's paintings toured Europe, visiting the Museum Ludwig in Cologne, Germany, and the Tate Modern in London. The Tate exhibition became the second most visited in the gallery's history at the time, with more than 420,000 visitors.\nIn 2007, an exhibition focused on the period of Hopper's greatest achievements\u2014from about 1925 to mid-century\u2014was presented at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The show included fifty oil paintings, thirty watercolors, and twelve prints, including \"Nighthawks\", \"Chop Suey\", and \"Lighthouse and Buildings\". It was organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and the Art Institute of Chicago. The catalog, \"Edward Hopper\", by Carol Troyen, Judith A. Barter, Janet L. Comey, Elliot Bostwick Davis, and Ellen E. Roberts, was published by the Museum of Fine Arts Publishers, 2007 ().\nIn 2010, the Fondation de l'Hermitage in Lausanne, Switzerland, held an exhibition covering Hopper's entire career, with works drawn largely from the Whitney Museum in New York City. It included paintings, watercolors, etchings, cartoons, posters, and preparatory studies for selected paintings. The exhibition had previously been displayed in Milan and Rome.\nIn 2012, a major exhibition opened at the Grand Palais in Paris. Divided into two parts, it covered Hopper's formative years (1900\u20131924), with comparisons to his contemporaries and French influences, and his mature style from 1925 onward, featuring works like \"House by the Railroad\".\nFrom July 25\u2013October 26, 2015, the Carnegie Museum of Art displayed its collection of 17 Hopper works (paintings, drawings and prints) in \"Carnegie Museum of Art Collects Edward Hopper.\"\nIn 2020, the Fondation Beyeler in Switzerland staged an exhibition emphasizing Hopper's representations of American landscapes and cityscapes, curated in collaboration with the Whitney Museum.\nIn 2020-2021 The Phillips Collection exhibited \"Hopper in Paris: Selections from the Whitney Museum of American Art\", focusing on works created during Hopper\u2019s time in Paris.\nFrom 2022 to 2023, the Whitney Museum mounted \"Edward Hopper's New York\", which explored the artist's relationship with the city he called home for nearly sixty years.\nArt market.\nWorks by Hopper rarely appear on the market. The artist was not prolific, painting just 366 canvases; during the 1950s, when he was in his 70s, he produced approximately five paintings a year.\nHopper's longtime dealer, Frank Rehn, who gave the artist his first solo show in 1924, sold \"Hotel Window\" (1956) to collector Olga Knoepke for $7,000 () in 1957. In 1999, the Forbes Collection sold it to actor Steve Martin privately for around $10\u00a0million. In 2006, Martin sold it for $26.89\u00a0million at Sotheby's New York, an auction record for the artist at that time.\nIn 2013, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia put Hopper's \"East Wind Over Weehawken\" (1934) up for sale, hoping to garner $22\u2013$28\u00a0million to establish a fund to acquire contemporary art. The painting, a street scene rendered in dark, earthy tones depicting the gabled house at 1001 Boulevard East at the corner of 49th Street in Weehawken, New Jersey, is considered one of Hopper's best works. It was acquired directly from the dealer handling the artist's paintings in 1952, fifteen years before the death of the painter. The painting sold for a record-breaking $36\u00a0million at Christie's in New York, to an anonymous telephone bidder.\nIn 2018, after the death of art collector Barney A. Ebsworth and the subsequent auction of many pieces from his collection, \"Chop Suey\" (1929) was sold for $91.9\u00a0million, becoming the most expensive of Hopper's works ever bought at auction.\nIn popular culture.\nIn addition to his influence (see ), Hopper is frequently referenced in popular culture.\nIn 1981, \"Hopper's Silence\", a documentary by Brian O'Doherty produced by the Whitney Museum of American Art, was shown at the New York Film Festival at Alice Tully Hall.\nAustrian director Gustav Deutsch created the 2013 film \"Shirley \u2013 Visions of Reality\" based on 13 of Edward Hopper's paintings.\nOther works based on or inspired by Hopper's paintings include Tom Waits's 1975 album \"Nighthawks at the Diner\", and a 2012 series of photographs by Gail Albert Halaban.\nIn the book (1985, 1998) and traveling exhibition called \"Hopper's Places\", Gail Levin located and photographed the sites for many of Hopper's paintings. In her 1985 review of a related show organized by Levin, Vivien Raynor wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"Miss Levin's deductions are invariably enlightening, as when she infers that Hopper's tendency to elongate structures was a reflection of his own great height.\"\nNew wave band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark's 1985 album \"Crush\" features artwork inspired by several Hopper paintings, including \"Early Sunday Morning\", \"Nighthawks\", and \"Room in New York\". The band's 2013 single \"Night Caf\u00e9\" was influenced by \"Nighthawks\" and mentions Hopper by name. Seven of his paintings are referenced in the lyrics.\nThe New York City Opera staged the East Coast premiere of Stewart Wallace's \"Hopper's Wife\"\u2014a 1997 chamber opera about an imagined marriage between Edward Hopper and the gossip columnist Hedda Hopper\u2014at Harlem Stage in 2016.\nIrish novelist Christine Dwyer Hickey published a novel, \"The Narrow Land\", in 2019 in which Edward and Jo Hopper were central characters.\nPaul Weller included a song named \"Hopper\" on his 2017 album \"A Kind Revolution\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65330", "revid": "45589087", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65330", "title": "Infant formula", "text": "Manufactured food designed for feeding infants\nInfant formula, also called baby formula, simply formula (American English), formula milk, baby milk, or infant milk (British English), is a manufactured food designed and marketed for feeding babies and infants under 12 months of age, usually prepared for bottle-feeding or cup-feeding from powder (mixed with water) or liquid (with or without additional water). The U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) defines infant formula as \"a food which purports to be or is represented for special dietary use solely as a food for infants because it simulates human milk or its suitability as a complete or partial substitute for human milk\".\nA 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) report found that infant formula prepared per applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their \"Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding\", which restated that \"processed-food products for ... young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission\", and also warned that \"lack of breastfeeding\u2014and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life\u2014are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality\".\nSome studies have shown that use of formula can vary according to the parents' socio-economic status, ethnicity or other characteristics.\nUsage.\nThe use and marketing of infant formula have been subject to scrutiny. Breastfeeding, including exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, is widely advocated as \"ideal\" for babies and infants, both by health authorities\u2014and accordingly in ethical advertising of infant formula manufacturers. Despite the recommendation that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months, 48% of infants below this age are exclusively breastfed worldwide. The overwhelming majority of American babies are not exclusively breastfed for this period\u2014in 2025 24.9% of babies were breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months, with nearly 40% of babies less than 3 months of age being supplemented with infant formula in 2022, and approximately 20% of infants having infant formula feeding within two days of birth. The use of hydrolysed cow milk baby formula versus standard milk baby formula does not appear to change the risk of allergies or autoimmune diseases.\nUse of infant formula.\nIn some cases, breastfeeding is medically contraindicated; these include:\nOther reasons for not breastfeeding include:\nHealth risks and controversies.\nThe use of infant formula has been cited for association with numerous increased health risks. Studies have found infants in developed countries who consume formula are at increased risk for acute otitis media, gastroenteritis, severe lower respiratory tract infections, atopic dermatitis, asthma, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), eczema and necrotizing enterocolitis when compared to infants who are breastfed. Some studies have found an association between infant formula and lower cognitive development, including iron supplementation in baby formula being linked to lowered I.Q. and other neurodevelopmental delays; however other studies have found no correlation. Causation, however, has not been established for negative long-term health effects of infant formula; studies analyzing health outcomes for breastfed vs. formula fed babies are primarily observational in nature and are plagued with confounding factors such as socioeconomic status, education level, and maternal preexisting conditions (such as obesity, which is associated with both low milk production and childhood obesity). When confounding factors are controlled for, differences between the long-term health of breastfed and formula-fed infants decrease.\nMelamine contamination.\nIn 2008, a case of melamine poisoning of infant formula was discovered in China, where milk was deliberately adulterated with the chemical, leading to the death of six babies, and illnesses in more than 300,000 infants, including cases of acute kidney failure. Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels. Some of those responsible for the poisoning were sentenced to death.\nIn November 2008, traces of melamine were reported to have been found by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in infant formula sold in the United States made by the three main American firms \u2014 Abbott Laboratories, Nestl\u00e9, and Mead Johnson \u2014 responsible for 90\u201399% of the infant formula market in the country. The levels were much less than those reported in China, where levels of melamine contamination had reached as much as 2,500 parts per million (2.5%), about 10,000 times higher than the recorded US levels. The safety data sheet for melamine (CAS registry number 108-78-1; C3-H6-N6) recorded the acute oral toxicity (median lethal dose) at 3161\u00a0mg/kg for a rat.\nHealth Canada conducted a separate test and also detected traces of melamine in infant formula available in Canada. The melamine levels were well below Health Canada's safety limits, although concerns remain about the safety of manufactured food for infants and monitoring of potentially dangerous substances.\nBacterial Contamination.\nLike many prepared food products, infant formulas are occasionally contaminated with disease causing bacteria, occasionally at the source of production. \"Cronobacter sakazakii\" (formerly \"Enterobacter sakazakii\"), is a Gram-negative bacterium that has been occasionally found in infant formula products, likely due to its association with dried foods. Rarely, use of powdered infant formula (PIF) has been associated with serious illness, and even death, due to infection with \"Cronobacter sakazakii\" and other microorganisms that can be introduced to PIF during its production. Although \"C. sakazakii\" can cause illness in all age groups, infants are believed to be at greatest risk of infection. Between 1958 and 2006, there have been several dozen reported cases of \"C. sakazakii\" infection worldwide. The WHO believes that such infections are under-reported. In November 2025, infant formula contaminated with spores of the bacteria \"Clostridium botulinum\", the causative agent of botulism, were detected as the cause of an outbreak of infant botulism sickening 13.\nSocioeconomic conditions.\nAccording to a research conducted in Vancouver, Canada, 82.9% of mothers breastfeed their babies at birth, but the number differed between Caucasians (91.6%) and non-Caucasians (56.8%), with the difference essentially attributed to marital status, education and family income. In the United States, mothers of lower socio-economic status are less likely to breastfeed, although this may be partly related to the adverse effects of government nutrition supplementation programs that provide subsidies for infant formula.\nIn less economically developed countries, the use of infant formula is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including a lack of clean water and a lack of sanitizing equipment. A formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 times more likely to die of diarrhea and four times more likely to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child.\nPreparation and content.\nVariations.\nInfant formulas come in powder, liquid concentrate, and ready-to-feed forms. They are designed to be prepared by the parent or caregiver in small batches and fed to the infant, usually with either a cup or a baby bottle.\nInfant formulas come in a variety of types:\nManufacturers and health officials advise that it is very important to measure powders or concentrates accurately to achieve the intended final product concentration; otherwise, the child will be malnourished. All equipment that comes into contact with the infant formula should be cleaned and sterilized before each use. Proper refrigeration is essential for any infant formula that is prepared in advance.\nIn developing countries, formula is frequently prepared improperly, resulting in high infant mortality due to malnutrition and diseases such as diarrhea and pneumonia. This is due to a lack of clean water, lack of sterile conditions, a lack of refrigeration, illiteracy (so written instructions cannot be followed), poverty (diluting formula so that it lasts longer), and a lack of education of mothers by formula distributors. These problems and resulting disease and death are a key factor in opposition to the marketing and distribution of infant formula in developing countries by numerous public health agencies and NGOs (discussed in more detail at Nestl\u00e9 boycott and International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes).\nNutritional content.\nManufacturers state that the composition of infant formula is designed to be roughly based on a human mother's milk at approximately one to three months postpartum; however, there are significant differences in the nutrient content of these products. The most commonly used infant formulas contain purified cow's milk whey and casein as a protein source, a blend of vegetable oils as a fat source, lactose as a carbohydrate source, a vitamin-mineral mix, and other ingredients depending on the manufacturer. Modern infant formulas also contain human milk oligosaccharides, which are beneficial for immune development and a healthy gut microbiota in babies. In addition, there are infant formulas using soybean as a protein source in place of cow's milk (mostly in the United States and Great Britain) and formulas using protein hydrolysed into its component amino acids for infants who are allergic to other proteins.\nAn upswing in breastfeeding in many countries has been accompanied by a deferment in the average age of introduction of baby foods (including cow's milk), resulting in both increased breastfeeding and increased use of infant formula between the ages of 3- and 12-months.\nBesides breast milk, infant formula is the only other milk product that the medical community considers nutritionally acceptable for infants under the age of one year (as opposed to cow's milk, goat's milk, or follow-on formula). Supplementing with solid food in addition to breast milk or formula begins during weaning, and most babies begin supplementing about the time their first teeth appear, usually around the age of six months.\nAlthough cow's milk is the basis of almost all infant formula, plain cow's milk is unsuited for infants because of its high casein content and low whey content, and untreated cow's milk is not recommended before the age of 12 months. The infant intestine is not properly equipped to digest non-human milk, and this may often result in diarrhea, intestinal bleeding and malnutrition. To reduce the negative effect on the infant's digestive system, cow's milk used for formula undergoes processing to be made into infant formula. This includes steps to make protein more easily digestible and alter the whey-to-casein protein balance to one closer to human milk, the addition of several essential ingredients (often called \"fortification\", see below), the partial or total replacement of dairy fat with fats of vegetable or marine origin, etc.\nCarbohydrates are an important source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow's milk-based formulas, lactose is the main source of carbohydrates present, but lactose is not present in cow's milk-based lactose-free formulas, nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with milk protein sensitivity. Lactose is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without lactose will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and glucose, dextrins, and natural and modified starches. Lactose is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.\nThe nutrient content of infant formula for sale in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on recommendations by the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. The following must be included in all formulas produced in the U.S.:\nNon-milk-based formulas must also add the vitamins biotin, choline and inositol.\nAdditionally, manufacturers may choose to add additional ingredients to their formulas. These additional ingredients are often used to differentiate their products in the market, as the nutrient composition of formulas is otherwise highly similar between products. Not all additives are clearly beneficial according to current studies, either because no benefit has been demonstrated, or because the additives are too new to have received significant scientific scrutiny.\n Omega-3 fatty acids, such as DHA, are often added to infant formula, purportedly to support brain development, although studies have generally failed to find a significant effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes. Infants can synthesize DHA and other fatty acids from the linoleic acid in formula. As formula additives, these fatty acids are often derived from fish oil or similar sources.\n HMOs are naturally occurring sugars found in human breast milk and may work to improve the immune system and act as nutrients for beneficial gut bacteria. However, while human breastmilk contains dozens of different types of HMOs, commercial infant formula usually only includes a few of the more common types.\n Nucleotides are compounds found naturally in human breast milk. They are involved in critical metabolic processes, such as energy metabolism and enzymatic reactions. Also, as the building blocks of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA), they are essential for normal body functions. Compared to human breast milk, cow's milk has lower levels of the nucleotides uridine, inosine, and cytidine. Therefore, several companies that produce infant formula have added nucleotides to their infant formulas.\nOther commonly used ingredients:\nPolicy, industry and marketing.\nThe policy, regulatory, and industry environments surrounding the infant formula market vary tremendously between countries.\nInternational.\nThe International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes is an international health policy framework adopted by the World Health Assembly of the WHO in 1981 regarding infant formula marketing, including strict restrictions on advertising. Its implementation depends on the laws of different countries and the behavior of infant formula manufacturers \u2013 the code has no power itself. Legislation and corporate behavior vary significantly between countries: at least 84 countries have enacted national legislation implementing all or many of the provisions of the Code, and 14 countries have draft laws awaiting adoption; whereas elsewhere, neither the Code nor its principles are followed by governments or formula manufacturers.\nPractices that are banned in the Code include most advertising, claiming health benefits for formula, and giving free samples to women able to breastfeed \u2013 this latter practice is particularly criticized because it can interfere with lactation, creating dependence on formula, without proper education on ensuring continued breast stimulation while formula is being used. In many countries, free samples of infant formula have been provided to hospitals for decades; infant formula is often the only product routinely provided free of charge to hospitals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) aims to reduce and eliminate this controversial practice; however, there is increasing criticism of the BFHI's rigidity in limiting use of infant formula, which can be an appropriate treatment for common conditions such as suboptimal intake jaundice, and may cause mothers to feel pressured or guilted into breastfeeding.\nBy country.\nPhilippines.\nInfant formula is one of the top three consumer commodities in the Philippines, and among the most imported products. Annual sales amount to some US$469 million annually. US$88 million is spent on advertising the product.\nInfant formula marketing has been regulated since the 1987 Executive Order 51 or \"Milk Code\", which regulated, but did not ban, practices such as advertising and providing free samples. Shortly after it was enacted, Wyeth introduced \"follow-on formula\", which was not in the purview of the Milk Code, which predated its market entry.\nIn 2006, the Department of Health banned the advertising of infant formula and the practice of providing free samples, regardless of intended age group (in the \"Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations\" of Executive Order 51, or RIRR). The new regulation was challenged by the infant formula industry in the Supreme Court. Initially the challenge was dismissed, but this decision was reversed following industry pressure and a controversial letter by American business leader Thomas Donahue, then President and CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, resulting in the regulation being suspended and advertising continuing.\n\"The Guardian\" newspaper reports widespread illegal advertising and marketing of formula milk contrary to World Health Organization guidelines. Doctors and midwives are encouraged to promote feeding babies formula milk, and advertising also targets mothers directly. Babies get sick and sometimes die because poor mothers cannot sterilize bottles.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, there is a move towards plain packaging of infant formula under R 991 of the Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act; as of 6 December 2013, Regulation 7 (Sale and Promotion) is force, whereas Regulations 2-6 (primarily with respect to labelling) are scheduled to come into force on 6 December 2014.\nOne of the key requirements as per Regulation 3.1.A.iii is a conspicuous message stating \"[t]his product shall only be used on the advice of a health professional\".\nThailand.\nIn 2017, Thailand banned advertising for infant formula. Initially, a ban on advertising for toddler formula was also proposed, but was dropped after the intervention of United States trade officials.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the United Kingdom, infant formula advertising has been prohibited since 1995; advertising for \"follow-on formula\" is legal, which has been cited as a loophole allowing advertising of similarly packaged formula.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, infant formula is both heavily marketed\u2014the country has not adopted the WHO Code, nor is it being systematically implemented by manufacturers for domestic marketing\u2014and even heavily subsidized by the government: at least one third of the American market is supported by the government, with over half of infant formula sold in the country provided through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (known as WIC). This aggressive marketing crosses international boundaries, with the US intervening in at least 17 jurisdiction including Thailand, Canada, EU, South African, and China to oppose attempts at restricting infant formula marketing or requiring extra safety standards to protect US infant formula exports.\nAccording to surveys, over 70% of large U.S. hospitals dispense infant formula to all infants, a practice opposed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and in violation of the Code. The Gerber Products Company began marketing its brand of infant formula directly to the public in October 1989, while the Carnation Company began marketing \"Good Start\" infant formula directly to the public in January 1991.\nInfant formula costs are a significant fraction of the WIC program costs: 21% post-rebate and 46% pre-rebate. Formula manufacturers are granted a WIC monopoly in individual states. Meanwhile, breastfeeding rates are substantially lower for WIC recipients; this is partly attributed to formula being free of charge to mothers in the WIC program, who are of lower socio-economic status. Violations of federal policy have also been found in terms of infant formula company advertising using the WIC trademark, to reach both WIC and non-WIC participants. In recent years WIC has been expanding its breastfeeding promotion strategies, including providing subsidies for clients who use milk banks.\n2022 United States Baby Formula Shortages.\nSupply chain disruptions related to the government response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States have been reported as responsible for causing widespread shortages of infant formula in the United States, as of May 2022. This contrasts with far less severe shortages of infant formula around the globe. Reason magazine reported that this was largely the result of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) processes delaying approval of otherwise safe infant formula from Europe or other sources abroad, which might otherwise have eased demand for infant formula tensions in the United States.\nAs a result of the shortages, on May 16, 2022, the FDA announced that it would temporarily ease enforcement of some labeling rules to allow the importation of foreign formulas. FDA Commissioner Robert Califf stated, \"Today's action paves the way for companies who don't normally distribute their infant formula products in the U.S. to do so efficiently and safely. We anticipate that those products that can quickly meet safety and nutrition standards could hit U.S. stores in a matter of weeks.\" Former FDA associate commissioner, Peter Pitts, asserts that the FDA's regulatory scheme is at least partially to blame for the shortage. Pitts states, \"The difference between European baby formula and American baby formula, more or less, is that the labeling is different. The knot in getting that product into the U.S. isn't safety, it's a regulatory issue. I don't want to say it's a nitty issue, but it's certainly something the FDA could have jumped on a lot quicker.\"\nAmid and before the formula shortages, Woman and Infant Children (WIC) centers in Georgia and North Carolina were disposing of infant formula. This was done under the USDA's recommendation that unused, returned WIC infant formula were to be disposed of upon return. Despite an attempt by the USDA to walk back this recommendation by stating that it is a recommendation rather than a requirement, the USDA confirms that it will not reverse this recommendation, even amid the formula shortage. As a result, from October 2021 through May 2022, 16,459 cans of baby formula were destroyed by WIC clinics in Georgia and an unknown amount of baby formula cans were destroyed in North Carolina and other US States.\nOn July 6, 2022, the FDA announced that it would change its rules to allow foreign formula manufacturers to permanently import their goods into the U.S., potentially reducing the severity of the shortage. Critics of the FDA note that this does not remove the regulations entirely and that this shortage has been self-imposed by the FDA from the start. Additionally, critics note that if a formula maker passes EU regulations, this should be good enough for the FDA to allow importation of that formula.\nCritics of the FDA's regulatory policy note that the regulatory scheme surrounding European formulas is not borne from a science-based desire to protect children, but rather an influence that the US dairy industry has on the agency. Critics also note that if there were an issue with European formulas, the issue would be widespread among the European babies that regularly consume the formula.\nThe FORMULA Act is set to expire at the end of 2022, which will subsequently reinstate tariffs on foreign-made formula. Experts worry that this will result in a repeat formula shortage for 2023. The CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, a lobbying organization for dairy producers, wrote in a letter to Congress and the Biden administration to allow for the reinstatement of tariffs on foreign baby formula to commence.\nHistory.\nThe Wabanaki and other Native American tribal nations of North America made an infant formula from nuts and cornmeal. Elizabeth Hanson was kidnapped by Wabanaki in 1725 and a Native American woman showed Hanson how to make this infant formula and she included this in her captivity narrative.\nEarly infant foods.\nIn 1865, the first infant food was invented .\nThroughout history, mothers who could not breastfeed their babies either employed a wet nurse or, less frequently, prepared food for their babies, a process known as \"dry nursing\". Baby food composition varied according to region and economic status. In Europe and North America during the early 19th century, the prevalence of wet nursing began to decrease, while the practice of feeding babies mixtures based on animal milk rose in popularity. This trend was driven by cultural changes as well as increased sanitation measures, and it continued throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, with a notable increase after Elijah Pratt invented and patented the India-rubber nipple in 1845. As early as 1846, scientists and nutritionists noted an increase in medical problems and infant mortality was associated with dry nursing. In an attempt to improve the quality of manufactured baby foods, in 1867, Justus von Liebig developed the world's first commercial infant formula, \"Liebig's Soluble Food for Babies\". The success of this product quickly gave rise to competitors such as Mellin's Food, Ridge's Food for Infants and Nestl\u00e9's Milk.\nRaw milk formulas.\nAs physicians became increasingly concerned about the quality of such foods, medical recommendations such as Thomas Morgan Rotch's \"percentage method\" (published in 1890) began to be distributed, and gained widespread popularity by 1907. These complex formulas recommended that parents mix cow's milk, water, cream, and sugar or honey in specific ratios to achieve the nutritional balance believed to approximate human milk reformulated in such a way as to accommodate the believed digestive capability of the infant.\nAt the dawn of the 20th century in the United States, most infants were breastfed, although many received some formula feeding as well. Home-made \"percentage method\" formulas were more commonly used than commercial formulas in both Europe and the United States. They were less expensive and were widely believed to be healthier. However, formula-fed babies exhibited more diet-associated medical problems, such as scurvy, rickets, and bacterial infections than breastfed babies. By 1920, the incidence of scurvy and rickets in formula-fed babies had greatly decreased through the addition of orange juice and cod liver oil to home-made formulas. Bacterial infections associated with formula remained a problem, more prevalent in the United States than in Europe, where milk was usually boiled prior to use in formulas.\nEvaporated milk formulas.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, evaporated milk began to be widely commercially available at low prices, and several clinical studies in the period suggested that breastfed babies and babies fed evaporated milk equally thrived.\nThese studies, accompanied by the affordable price of evaporated milk and the availability of the home icebox, initiated a tremendous rise in the use of evaporated milk formulas. By the late 1930s, the use of evaporated milk formulas in the United States surpassed all commercial formulas, and by 1950, over half of all babies in the United States were reared on such formulas.\nCommercial formulas.\nIn parallel with the enormous shift (in industrialized nations) away from breastfeeding to home-made formulas, nutrition scientists continued to analyze human milk and attempted to make infant formulas that more closely matched its composition. Maltose and dextrins were believed nutritionally important, and in 1912, the Mead Johnson Company released a milk additive called \"Dextri-Maltose\". This formula was made available to mothers only by physicians. In 1919, milk fats were replaced with a blend of animal and vegetable fats as part of the continued drive to closely simulate human milk. This formula was called SMA for \"simulated milk adapted.\"\nIn the late 1920s, Alfred Bosworth released \"Similac\" (for \"similar to lactation\"), and Mead Johnson released \"Sobee\". Several other formulas were released over the next few decades, but commercial formulas did not begin to seriously compete with evaporated milk formulas until the 1950s. The reformulation and concentration of Similac in 1951 and the introduction (by Mead Johnson) of Enfamil (for \"infant milk\") in 1959 were accompanied by marketing campaigns that provided inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians. By the early 1960s, commercial formulas were more commonly used than evaporated milk formulas in the United States, which all but vanished in the 1970s. By the early 1970s, over 75% of American babies were fed on formulas, almost entirely commercially produced.\nWhen birth rates in industrial nations tapered off during the 1960s, infant formula companies heightened marketing campaigns in non-industrialized countries. The poor sanitation in these countries led to steeply increased mortality rates among infants fed the often contaminated formula. Additionally, a WHO has cited over-diluting formula preparations as resulting in infant malnourishment. Organized protests, the most famous of which was the Nestl\u00e9 boycott of 1977, called for an end to unethical marketing. This boycott is ongoing, as the current coordinators maintain that Nestl\u00e9 engages in marketing practices which violate the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes.\nGeneric brand formulas.\nIn addition to commercially marketed brands, generic brands (or store brands) of infant formula were introduced in the United States in 1997, first by PBM Products. These private label formulas are sold by many leading food and drug retailers such as Wal-Mart, Target, Kroger, Loblaws, and Walgreens. All infant formula brands in the United States are required to adhere to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. As reported by the Mayo Clinic: \"as with most consumer products, brand-name infant formulas cost more than generic brands. But that doesn't mean that brand-name [Similac, Nestle, Enfamil] formulas are better. Although manufacturers may vary somewhat in their formula recipes, the FDA requires that all formulas contain the same nutrient density.\"\nSimilarly, in Canada, all infant formulas, regardless of brand, are required to meet standards set by Health Canada.\nFollow-on, transition, and toddler formulas.\nFollow-on or toddler formulas are sold for ages 6 months to 3 years (when infants are typically breastfed). In the US, a transition formula is marketed for children from age 9 to 24 months, and a toddler milk is sold for children aged 12 to 26 months. In the UK, follow-on milk is marketed towards children 6\u201312 months, and toddler milk for children aged 2 to 3 years. Toddler milk marketed in the US contains powdered milk, corn syrup and other added sugars, vegetable oil, and salt.\nToddler formulas are not nutritionally complete, nor are they subject to the same regulations or food labeling laws as infant formula. Critics have argued that follow-on and toddler formulas were introduced to circumvent the regulations regarding infant formula and have resulted in confusing advertising.\nAn early example of follow-on formula was introduced by Wyeth in the Philippines in 1987, following the introduction in this country of regulations on infant formula advertising, but which did not address follow-on formulas (products that did not exist at the time of their drafting). Similarly, while infant formula advertising is illegal in the United Kingdom, follow-on formula advertising is legal, and the similar packaging and market results in follow-on advertisements frequently being interpreted as advertisements for formula. (See also industry and marketing, below.)\nThese products have also recently fallen under criticism for contributing to the childhood obesity epidemic in some developed countries due to their marketing and flavoring practices. The drinks are also expensive. Although usually not quite as expensive as infant formula, they can cost four times the price of cow's milk.\nUsage since 1970s.\nSince the early 1970s, industrial countries have witnessed a resurgence in breastfeeding among newborns and infants to 6 months of age. This upswing in breastfeeding has been accompanied by a delay in the average age of introduction of other foods (such as cow's milk), resulting in increased use of both breastfeeding and infant formula between the ages of 3\u201312 months.\nThe global infant formula market has been estimated at $7.9 billion, with North America and Western Europe accounting for 33% of the market and considered largely saturated, and Asia representing 53% of the market. South East Asia is a particularly large fraction of the world market relative to its population. Infant formula is the largest segment of the baby food market, with the fraction given as between 40% and 70%.\nLeading health organizations (e.g. WHO, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Department of Health and Human Services) are attempting to reduce the use of infant formula and increase the prevalence of breastfeeding from birth through 12 to 24 months of age through public health awareness campaigns. The specific goals and approaches of these breastfeeding promotion programs, and the policy environment surrounding their implementation, vary by country. As a policy basic framework, the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes, adopted by the WHO's World Health Assembly in 1981, requires infant formula companies to preface their product information with statements that breastfeeding is the best way of feeding babies and that a substitute should only be used after consultation with health professionals. The Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) also restricts use by hospitals of free formula or other infant care aids provided by formula companies. (See also Policy section below.) While the Code was intended to restrict inappropriate \"marketing\" of infant formula, not access to it, parents have complained of being lectured or made to sign waivers implying formula would harm their babies in BFHI hospitals.\nInfant formula processing.\nHistory.\nA formula containing wheat flour, cow's milk, malt flour, and potassium bicarbonate was developed in 1867. A powder form was introduced in 1915, containing cow's milk, lactose, oleo oils, and vegetable oils. In 1929, Soy formula was introduced. In 1935, Protein was added because it was believed cow's milk protein content was lower than human milk protein content; protein at 3.3\u20134.0 g/100 kcal was added.\nIron fortification was introduced in 1959 because a large amount of iron (~80%) is used to expand the red blood cell mass in a growing infant. Infants with birth weights between 1500~2500g require 2\u00a0mg/kg of iron per day. Infants with weights of less than 1500g require 4\u00a0mg/kg per day. In 1962, The whey:casein ratio was made similar to human milk because producers were aware that human milk contains a higher ratio of whey protein, and cow's milk contains a higher ratio of casein. In 1984, Taurine fortification was introduced because newborn infants lack the enzymes needed to convert and form taurine.\nNucleotide fortification was introduced into infant formula in the late 1990s because nucleotides can act as growth factors and may enhance the infant's immune system. In the Early 2000s, Polyunsaturated fatty acid fortification was introduced because those fatty acids play an important role in infant brain development. It mainly include Polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA).\nCurrent general procedure.\nThe manufacturing process may differ for different types of formula made; therefore, the following is the general procedure for liquid-milk based formulas:\n Primary ingredients are blended in large stainless steel tanks, and skim milk is added and adjusted to 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, fats, oils, and emulsifiers are added. Additional heating and mixing may be required to get proper consistency. Next, minerals, vitamins, and stabilizing gums are added at various points, depending on their sensitivity to heat. The batch is temporarily stored and then transported by pipelines to pasteurization equipment when mixing is complete.\n A process that protects against spoilage by eliminating bacteria, yeasts, and molds. It involves quickly heating and then cooling the product under controlled conditions, which microorganisms cannot survive. The batch is held at around 85\u201394\u00a0\u00b0C for approximately 30 seconds, which is necessary to adequately reduce micro-organisms and prepare the formula for filling.\n A process which increases emulsion uniformity and stability by reducing the size of fat and oil particles in the formula. It is done with a variety of mixing equipment that applies shear to the product, and this mixing breaks fat and oil particles into very small droplets.\n Used to ensure that the key parameters, like pH, fat concentration, and vitamins and mineral content, are correct. If insufficient levels of these are found, the batch is reworked to achieve appropriate levels. After this step, the batch is ready to be packaged.\n Generally, liquid formula is filled into metal cans with lids crimped into place, while detailed packaging will depend on the manufacturer and type of equipment used.\n Finally, infant formulas are heat-treated to maintain the bacteriologic quality of the product. This can be done traditionally by either retort sterilization or high-temperature short-time (HTST) treatment. Recently, ultrahigh-temperature-treated formula has become more commonly used. If powdered formula is made, then spray drying would be required in addition. Retort sterilization is a traditional retort sterilization method that uses 10-15mins treatment at 118\u00a0\u00b0C. Ultrahigh-temperature (UHT) is a method that uses a brief (2\u20133 seconds) treatment at 142\u00a0\u00b0C. Because of the short time used, there is little protein denaturation, but the process still ensures sterility of the final product.\nRecent and future potential new ingredients.\nProbiotics.\nRandomized, controlled trials completed in the 2000s have shown limited and short-term clinical benefits for the use of probiotics in infants' diet. A 2018 clinical study using the multistrain De Simone Formulation probiotic showed it helped some infants reduce symptoms of infant colic. The safety of probiotics in general and in infants, especially preterm infants, has been investigated in a limited number of controlled trials. The findings thus far suggest probiotics are generally safe, though the research is preliminary and has yet to provide definitive conclusions.\nPrebiotics.\nPrebiotics are undigestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of probiotic bacteria in the gut. Human milk contains a variety of oligosaccharides believed to be an important factor in the pattern of microflora colonization of breastfed infants. Because of the variety, variability, complexity, and polymorphism of the oligosaccharide composition and structure, it is currently not feasible to reproduce the oligosaccharide components of human milk in a strictly structural fashion.\nThe European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition Committee on Nutrition found evidence to support the short-term effects of ingesting prebiotics on the stool microflora of infants, with an increase in the number of bifidobacteria. Babies can be at risk of dehydration with the induction of softer stools, if they have kidney immaturity and/or a poor ability to concentrate urine. A reduction of pathogens has been associated with the consumption of prebiotics. However, there was no evidence to support major clinical or long-term benefits. Therefore, there is little evidence of beneficial effects of prebiotics in dietary products.\nLysozyme and lactoferrin.\nLysozyme is an enzyme that is responsible for protecting the body by damaging bacterial cell walls. Lactoferrin is a globular, multifunctional protein that has antimicrobial activity. Compared to human milk, cow's milk has significantly lower levels of lysozyme and lactoferrin; therefore, the industry has an increasing interest in adding them to infant formulas.\nLong chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation.\nSome manufacturers have begun supplementing formula milk with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA). The current evidence suggests that there may be little or no difference between formula milk with and without LCPUFA supplementation in terms of babies' visual function, physical growth, or neurodevelopment.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65342", "revid": "20957809", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65342", "title": "Battle of Brice's Cross Roads", "text": "1864 battle of the American Civil War\nThe Battle of Brice's Cross Roads, also known as the Battle of Tishomingo Creek or the Battle of Guntown, was fought on Friday, June 10, 1864, near Baldwyn, Mississippi, then part of the Confederate States of America. A Federal expedition from Memphis, Tennessee, of 4,800 infantry and 3,300 cavalry, under the command of Brigadier-General Samuel D. Sturgis, was defeated by a Confederate force of 3,500 cavalry under the command of Major-General Nathan B. Forrest. The battle was a victory for the Confederates. Forrest inflicted heavy casualties on the Federal force and captured more than 1,600 prisoners of war, 18 artillery pieces, and wagons loaded with supplies. Once Sturgis reached Memphis, he asked to be relieved of his command.\nBackground.\nIn March 1864, Lieutenant-General Ulysses Grant, newly named General in Chief of the Armies of the United States, and his most trusted subordinate Major-General William Tecumseh Sherman, planned a new, coordinated strategy to cripple the Confederate States and win the war. Grant would smash General Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia and head for Richmond. At the same time, Sherman would destroy the other main Confederate force, the Army of Tennessee, and seize the key city of Atlanta. Calling itself the \"Gate City of the South,\" Atlanta was the strategic back door to the Confederate States. It was the South's most productive arsenal after Richmond and a critical transportation hub: Four railroads radiating from the city carried supplies to their forces.\nPrelude.\nSherman began his Atlanta campaign during the first week of May, moving slowly south while battling Confederate forces under General Joseph E. Johnston, an excellent defensive fighter. Johnston called in reinforcements, including Lieutenant-General Leonidas Polk and two divisions of his Army of Mississippi, which in turn left Major-General Stephen D. Lee in command of all remaining Confederate forces within Polk's Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana. Lee took charge of the department, but wisely gave Forrest authority to act independently in the northern part of Mississippi and Tennessee.\nDuring the four-month Atlanta Campaign, the U.S. Army advanced steadily, but in the process extended their supply lines that stretched back to Nashville, Tennessee. As the campaign progressed, Sherman grew concerned the brazen Forrest might move his Confederate cavalry force out of North Mississippi into Middle Tennessee, strike the supply lines, and perhaps jeopardize the entire Federal effort. As a result, Sherman in late May ordered Sturgis out of Memphis and into North Mississippi with a force of just over 8,000 men. Sturgis's mission was to keep Forrest occupied and, if possible, destroy the Confederate cavalry force that Forrest commanded. Sherman's orders to Sturgis came just in time, as Forrest's cavalry had just left for Middle Tennessee and was forced to turn back to Mississippi to once again defend the northern part of the state. The Federal expedition marched out of Memphis on June 1. Sturgis had a great deal of discretion in his movements, but was generally expected to \"proceed to Corinth, Mississippi, by way of Salem and Ruckersville, capture any force that may be there, then proceed south, destroying the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to Tupelo and Okolona, and as far as possible toward Macon and Columbus.\"\nBattle.\nAt 9:45\u00a0a.m., on June 10, a brigade of Benjamin H. Grierson's Cavalry Division reached Brice's Cross Roads. The battle started at 10:30\u00a0a.m. when the Confederates performed a stalling operation with a brigade of their own. Forrest ordered the rest of his cavalry to converge around the cross roads. The remainder of the Federal cavalry arrived in support, but a strong Confederate assault soon pushed them back at 11:30\u00a0a.m., when the balance of Forrest's Cavalry Corps arrived on the scene. Grierson called for infantry support and Sturgis obliged. The line held until 1:30\u00a0p.m. when the first regiments of U.S. infantry arrived.\nThe Federal line, initially bolstered by the infantry, briefly seized the momentum and attacked the Confederate left flank, but Forrest launched an attack from his extreme right and left wings, before the rest of the Federal infantry could take the field. In this phase of the battle, Forrest commanded his field artillery to unlimber, unprotected, only yards from the Federal line, and to shred their troops with canister. The massive damage caused Sturgis to reorder his line in a tighter semicircle around Brice's Cross Roads, facing east.\nAt 3:30, Forrest's 2nd Tennessee Cavalry assaulted the bridge across the Tishomingo. Although the attack failed, it caused severe confusion among the U.S. troops, and Sturgis ordered a general retreat. With the Tennesseans still pressing, the retreat bottlenecked at the Tishomingo bridge and a panicked rout developed instead. During the retreat, Black Union troops inflicted heavy losses on Forrest's troops, a turn of events seen as revenge for the Fort Pillow massacre of Black Union troops by Confederates under Forrest, which allowed Sturgis to escape and plan further raids. Sturgis's forces fled wildly, pursued across six counties on their return to Memphis before the exhausted Confederate attackers retired.\nAftermath.\nIn correspondence with Brigadier-General Sturgis, Colonel Alex Wilkin, commander of the 9th Minnesota, listed several reasons for the loss of the battle. He stated that General Sturgis, knowing that his men were under-supplied, having been on less than half rations, had been hesitant to advance on the enemy, but had done so against his better judgment because he had been ordered to do so. When the cavalry had engaged the enemy, many of the infantry had been ordered to advance double-time to support the cavalry. In their weakened condition, many had fallen out in the advance. Those who did arrive were exhausted at the beginning of the battle, while the Confederates were fresh and well fed, owing to a large supply in their rear.\nThe roads to Tupelo were wet and sloppy due to six sequential days of rain, which slowed the advance of the supply wagons and ammunition train. Several men were detailed to try to make the roads passable. Additionally, the horses pulling the trains were poorly fed because there had been little in the way of forage for them to eat along the way. This accounted for Major-General Forrest's capture of the artillery and supplies. Intelligence had entirely favored the South, because the Confederates had been constantly fed information about the position and strength of the Federals from civilians in the area, while Brigadier-General Sturgis had received no such intelligence. Because of this information, Forrest planned to meet the Federals at a place where he could ambush Sturgis and make retreat as difficult as possible. This location was close to his supply depot, and very far from the U.S. Army's. When the retreat had occurred, with food and supplies exhausted, many of the Federal soldiers were unable to retreat with the rest because of fatigue. This was why so many Federals were taken prisoner during the battle. Finally, Wilkin stated that the rumors that Sturgis had been intoxicated at the battle were false.\nThe Chippewa of G Co. 9th Minnesota were part of the rear guard at Brices Crossroads. There their marksmanship and skirmisher tactics enabled 400 men of the 59th U.S. Colored to not be overtaken by the confederate cavalry at the Tishomingo bridge. After which the Chippewa and African Americans fell back together. \nBattlefield preservation.\nThe Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site, established in 1929, commemorates the Battle of Brice's Cross Roads and is considered one of the best preserved of the American Civil War. The National Park Service erected and maintains monuments and interpretive panels on a small plot at the cross roads. In 1994, concerned citizens organized the Brice's Cross Roads National Battlefield Commission, Inc., to protect and preserve additional battlefield land. With assistance from the Civil War Trust (now the American Battlefield Trust), and the support of federal, state, and local governments, BCNBC has purchased for preservation over . Much of the land was purchased from The Agnew Family, who still own some of the property that became the site of the battlefield. The modern Bethany Presbyterian Church is at the southeast side of the cross roads. At the time of the battle this congregation's meeting house was located further south along the Baldwyn Road. Bethany Cemetery, adjacent to the National Park Service monument, predates the American Civil War. Many of the area's earliest settlers are buried here. The graves of more than 90 Confederate soldiers killed at the cross roads are also located in Bethany Cemetery. Federal soldiers were buried in common graves, but were later reinterred in the Memphis National Cemetery.\nThe American Battlefield Trust and its partners, including BCNBC, have been acquiring and preserving land at Brice's Cross Roads since 1996, when the Trust's predecessor organization, the Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites (APCWS), acquired and preserved 797.7 acres \u2013 about two-thirds of the battlefield \u2013 in two purchases. In 2001, two years after the merger of the APCWS and the original Civil War Trust, the new organization, the Civil War Preservation Trust, now known as the American Battlefield Trust, acquired 512.8 additional acres. Additional purchases during the past 16 years have increased the total battlefield land acquired and preserved to 1,500 acres as of late-2021, which is nearly the entire battlefield.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

Diagnosis requires that the death remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m., or when the baby is sleeping. There is usually no noise or evidence of struggle. SIDS remains one of the leading causes of infant mortality in Western countries, constituting almost 1/3 of all post-neonatal deaths.\nThe exact cause of SIDS is unknown. The requirement of a combination of factors including a specific underlying susceptibility, a specific time in development, and an environmental stressor has been proposed. These environmental stressors may include sleeping on the stomach or side, overheating, and exposure to tobacco smoke. Accidental suffocation from bed sharing (also known as co-sleeping) or soft objects may also play a role. Another risk factor is being born before 37 weeks of gestation. Between 1% and 5% of SIDS cases are estimated to be misidentified infanticides caused by intentional suffocation. SIDS makes up about 80% of sudden and unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs). The other 20% of cases are often caused by infections, genetic disorders, and heart problems.\nThe most effective method of reducing the risk of SIDS is putting a child less than one-year-old on their back to sleep. Other measures include a firm mattress separate from but close to caregivers, no loose bedding, a relatively cool sleeping environment, using a pacifier, and avoiding exposure to tobacco smoke. Breastfeeding and immunization may also be preventative. Measures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. Evidence is not sufficient for the use of fans. Grief support for families affected by SIDS is important, as the death of the infant is unexpected, unexplained, and can cause suspicion that the infant may have been intentionally harmed.\nRates of SIDS vary nearly tenfold in developed countries from one in a thousand to one in ten thousand. Globally, it resulted in about 19,200 deaths in 2015, down from 22,000 deaths in 1990. SIDS was the third leading cause of death in children less than one year old in the United States in 2011. It is the most common cause of death between one month and one year of age. About 90% of cases happen before six months of age, with it being most frequent between two months and four months of age. It is more common in boys than girls. Rates of SIDS have decreased by up to 80% in areas with \"Safe to Sleep\" campaigns.\nDefinition.\nThe syndrome applies only to infants under one year of age. SIDS is a diagnosis of exclusion and should be applied to only those cases in which an infant's death is sudden and unexpected, and remains unexplained after the performance of an adequate postmortem investigation, including:\nAfter investigation, some of these infant deaths are found to be caused by suffocation, hyperthermia or hypothermia, neglect or some other defined cause.\nAustralia and New Zealand shifted to \"sudden unexpected death in infancy\" (SUDI) for professional, scientific, and coronial clarity:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The term SUDI is now often used instead of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) because some coroners prefer to use the term 'undetermined' for a death previously considered to be SIDS. This change is causing a diagnostic shift in the mortality data. In addition, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have proposed that such deaths be called \"sudden unexpected infant deaths\" (SUID) and that SIDS is a subset of SUID.\nAge.\nSIDS has a four-parameter lognormal age distribution that spares infants shortly after birth\u2014the time of maximal risk for almost all other causes of non-trauma infant death.\nBy definition, SIDS deaths occur under the age of one year, with the peak incidence occurring when the infant is two to four months old. This is considered a critical period because the infant's ability to rouse from sleep is not yet mature.\nRisk factors.\nThe exact cause of SIDS is unknown. Although studies have identified risk factors for SIDS, such as putting infants to bed on their bellies, there has been little understanding of the syndrome's biological process or its potential causes. Deaths from SIDS are unlikely to be due to a single cause, but rather to multiple risk factors. The frequency of SIDS does appear to be influenced by social, economic, or cultural factors, such as maternal education, race or ethnicity, or poverty. SIDS is believed to occur when an infant with an underlying biological vulnerability, who is at a critical development age, is exposed to an external trigger. The following risk factors generally contribute either to the underlying biological vulnerability or represent an external trigger:\nTobacco smoke.\nSIDS rates are higher in babies of mothers who smoke during pregnancy. Between no smoking and smoking one cigarette a day, on average, the risk doubles. About 22% of SIDS in the United States is related to maternal smoking. SIDS correlates with levels of nicotine and its derivatives in the baby. Nicotine and derivatives cause alterations in neurodevelopment.\nSleeping.\nPlacing an infant to sleep while lying on the belly or side rather than on the back increases the risk for SIDS. This increased risk is greatest at two to three months of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals in the bed. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one year of age, as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs getting stuck in the bars of the crib.\nSharing a bed with parents or siblings increases the risk for SIDS. This risk is greatest in the first three months of life, when the mattress is soft, when one or more persons share the infant's bed, especially when the bed partners are using drugs or alcohol or are smoking. The risk remains, however, even in parents who do not smoke or use drugs. The American Academy of Pediatrics thus recommends \"room-sharing without bed-sharing\", stating that such an arrangement can decrease the risk of SIDS by up to 50%. Furthermore, the academy has recommended against devices marketed to make bed-sharing \"safe\", such as \"in-bed co-sleepers\".\nRoom sharing as opposed to solitary sleeping is known to decrease the risk of SIDS.\nBreastfeeding.\nBreastfeeding is associated with a lower risk of SIDS. It is not clear if co-sleeping among mothers who breastfeed without any other risk factors increases SIDS risk.\nPregnancy and infant factors.\nSIDS rates decrease with increasing maternal age, with teenage mothers at greatest risk. Delayed or inadequate prenatal care also increases risk. Low birth weight is a significant risk factor. In the United States from 1995 to 1998, the SIDS death rate for infants weighing 1000\u20131499 g was 2.89/1000, while for a birth weight of 3500\u20133999 g, it was only 0.51/1000. Premature birth increases the risk of SIDS death roughly fourfold. From 1995 to 1998, the US SIDS rate for births at 37\u201339 weeks of gestation was 0.73/1000, while the SIDS rate for births at 28\u201331 weeks of gestation was 2.39/1000.\nAnemia has also been linked to SIDS (however, per item 6 in the list of epidemiologic characteristics below, the extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant's total hemoglobin can only be measured during life). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant's first year.\nGenetics.\nGenetics plays a role, as SIDS is more prevalent in males. There is a consistent 50% male excess in SIDS per 1000 live births of each sex. Given a 5% male excess birth rate, there appears to be 3.15 male SIDS cases per 2 female cases, for a male fraction of 0.61. This value of 61% in the US is an average of 57% black male SIDS, 62.2% white male SIDS, and 59.4% for all other races combined. Note that when multiracial parentage is involved, the infant's race is arbitrarily assigned to one category or the other; most often, it is chosen by the mother. The X-linkage hypothesis for SIDS and the male excess in infant mortality have shown that the 50% male excess might be related to a dominant X-linked allele, occurring with a frequency of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;1\u20443 that is protective against transient cerebral anoxia. An unprotected male would occur with a frequency of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;2\u20443 and an unprotected female would occur with a frequency of &lt;templatestyles src=\"Fraction/styles.css\" /&gt;4\u20449.\nAbout 10 to 20% of SIDS cases are believed to be due to channelopathies, which are inherited defects in the ion channels that play an important role in the contraction of the heart.\nGenetic evidence published in November 2020 concerning the case of Kathleen Folbigg, who was imprisoned for the death of her children, showed that at least two of the children had genetic mutations in the CALM2 gene that predisposed them to heart complications. Kathleen was pardoned 5 June 2023 after spending 20 years in jail.\nAlcohol.\nDrinking of alcohol by parents is linked to SIDS. One study found a positive correlation between the two during New Years celebrations and weekends. Another found that alcohol use disorder was linked to a more than doubling of risk.\nOther.\nA 2022 study found that infants who died of SIDS exhibited significantly lower specific activity of butyrylcholinesterase, an enzyme involved in the brain's arousal pathway, shortly after birth. This can serve as a biomarker to identify infants with a potential autonomic cholinergic dysfunction and elevated risk for SIDS.\nSIDS has been linked to cold weather, with this association believed to be due to over-bundling and thus, overheating. Premature babies are at four times the risk of SIDS, possibly related to an underdeveloped ability to automatically control the cardiovascular system.\nA 2-part edition of \"The Cook Report\" from 1994 claimed that antimony- and phosphorus-containing compounds used as fire retardants in PVC and other cot mattress materials were a cause of SIDS. Subsequent investigation by an Expert Panel led by Lady Limerick found that there was no evidence to support this claim. The report also states that toxic gas cannot be generated from antimony in mattresses and that babies had SIDS on mattresses that did not contain the compound.\nIt has been suggested that some cases of SIDS may be related to \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and \"Escherichia coli\" infections.\nDiagnosis.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nSome conditions that are often undiagnosed and could be confused with or comorbid with SIDS include:\nFor example, an infant with MCAD deficiency might die by \"classical SIDS\" if found swaddled and prone, with its head covered, in an overheated room where parents were smoking. Genes indicating susceptibility to MCAD and Long QT syndrome do not protect an infant from dying of classical SIDS. Therefore, the presence of a susceptibility gene, such as for MCAD, means the infant might have died either from SIDS or from MCAD deficiency. It is currently impossible for a pathologist to distinguish between them.\nA 2010 study looked at 554 autopsies of infants in North Carolina that listed SIDS as the cause of death and suggested that many of these deaths may have been due to accidental suffocation. The study found that 69% of autopsies listed other possible risk factors that could have led to death, such as unsafe bedding or sleeping with adults.\nSeveral instances of infanticide have been uncovered in which the diagnosis was originally SIDS. Since an autopsy is often unable to determine whether asphyxiation is caused intentionally, medical practitioners rely on patient and family history and evidence of prior abuse to identify cases of infanticide. Some estimates in the 1980s and 1990s placed the potential rate of SIDS deaths caused by maltreatment around 10% and as high as 40%, but data from interventions such as the Safe to Sleep campaign suggest that these figures were substantially inflated. In 2006, the American Academy of Pediatrics estimated that between 1% and 5% of SIDS cases were potentially attributable to undiagnosed infanticide.\nSome have underestimated the risk of two SIDS deaths occurring in the same family; the Royal Statistical Society issued a media release refuting expert testimony in one UK case, in which the conviction was subsequently overturned.\nPrevention.\nSeveral measures are effective in preventing SIDS, including changing the sleeping position to supine, breastfeeding, limiting soft bedding, immunizing the infant, and using pacifiers. The use of electronic monitors is not useful as a preventative strategy. The effect that fans might have on the risk of SIDS has not been studied well enough to make any recommendation about them. Evidence regarding swaddling is unclear regarding SIDS. A 2016 review found tentative evidence that swaddling increases the risk of SIDS, especially among babies placed on their bellies or sides while sleeping.\nMeasures not shown to be useful include positioning devices and baby monitors. In the United States, companies that sell the monitors do not have FDA approval for them as medical devices.\nSleep positioning.\nSleeping on the back has been found to reduce the risk of SIDS. It is thus recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and promoted as a best practice by the US National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign. The incidence of SIDS has fallen in a number of countries in which this recommendation has been widely adopted. Sleeping on the back does not appear to increase the risk of choking, even in those with gastroesophageal reflux disease. While infants in this position may sleep more lightly, this is not harmful. Sharing the same room as the parents but in a different bed may decrease the SIDS risk by half.\nPacifiers.\nThe use of pacifiers appears to decrease the risk of SIDS, although the reason is unclear. The American Academy of Pediatrics considers pacifier use to prevent SIDS to be reasonable. Pacifiers do not appear to affect breastfeeding in the first four months, even though this is a common misconception.\nBedding.\nProduct safety experts advise against using pillows, overly soft mattresses, sleep positioners, bumper pads (crib bumpers), stuffed animals, or fluffy bedding in the crib, and recommend instead dressing the child warmly and keeping the crib \"naked.\"\nDue to the obvious dangers, experts have also warned that blankets or other clothing should not be placed over a baby's head.\nThe use of a \"baby sleep bag\" or \"sleep sack\", a soft bag with holes for the baby's arms and head, can be used as a type of bedding that warms the baby without covering its head.\nVaccination.\nInfants typically receive several vaccinations between the ages of 2 and 4 months, which is also the peak age for SIDS. Due to this coincidence, a number of studies have investigated the possible role of vaccinations as a cause of SIDS. These have found either no relation between vaccinations and SIDS, or a reduction of the risk of SIDS following vaccination. A 2007 meta-analysis found that vaccinations were associated with a halving of the risk of SIDS, and argued that immunisation should be a part of SIDS prevention campaigns.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally, SIDS resulted in about 22,000 deaths as of 2010[ [update]], down from 30,000 deaths in 1990. Rates vary significantly by population from 0.05 per 1000 in Hong Kong to 6.7 per 1000 in Native Americans.\nSIDS was responsible for 0.54 deaths per 1,000 live births in the US in 2005. It is responsible for far fewer deaths than congenital disorders and disorders related to short gestation, though it is the leading cause of death in healthy infants after one month of age.\nSIDS deaths in the US decreased from 4,895 in 1992 to 2,247 in 2004, a 54% decrease. During a similar time period, 1989 to 2004, SIDS as the cause of death for sudden infant death (SID) decreased from 80% to 55%, a 31% decrease. According to John Kattwinkel, chairman of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Special Task Force on SIDS \"A lot of us are concerned that the rate (of SIDS) isn't decreasing significantly, but that a lot of it is just code shifting\".\nRace.\n&lt;includeonly&gt;&lt;templatestyles src=\"Chart/styles.css\"/&gt;Rates of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome by race/ethnicity in the US, 2009. View .&lt;/includeonly&gt;\nThere are persistent disparities in SIDS deaths among racial and ethnic groups in the US. In 2009, the rates of death ranged from 20.3 per 100,000 live births for Asians and Pacific Islanders to 119.2 per 100,000 live births for Native Americans and Alaska Natives. The rate of SIDS deaths is 2.25 times greater for black infants than for white infants, which may be attributable to a greater incidence of SIDS risk factors. Rates are calculated per 100,000 live births to enable more accurate comparison across groups of different total population sizes.\nResearch suggests that factors that contribute more directly to SIDS risk\u2014maternal age, exposure to smoking, safe sleep practices, etc.\u2014vary by racial and ethnic group, and therefore risk exposure also varies by these groups. Risk factors associated with prone sleeping patterns of African American families include the mother's age, household poverty index, rural/urban status of residence, and infant's age. More than 50% of African American infants were placed in non-recommended sleeping positions, according to a 2012 study completed in South Carolina, indicating that cultural factors can be protective as well as problematic.\nThe rate of SIDS per 1000 births varies among ethnic groups in the United States:\nSociety and culture.\nIn 1994, the topic of Cot Death was the subject of a 2-part investigation of ITV's The Cook Report. Many popular media portrayals of infants show them in non-recommended sleeping positions.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Other common uses for leats include delivery of water for hydraulic mining and mineral concentration, for irrigation, to serve a dye works or other industrial plant, and provision of drinking water to a farm or household or as a catchment cut-off to improve the yield of a reservoir.\nAccording to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", \"leat\" is cognate with \"let\" in the sense of \"allow to pass through\". Other names for the same thing include \"fleam\" (probably a leat supplying water to a mill that did not have a millpool). In parts of northern England, for example around Sheffield, the equivalent word is \"goit\". In southern England, a leat used to supply water for water-meadow irrigation is often called a \"carrier\", \"top carrier\", or \"main\".\nDesign and functions.\nWater mills.\nLeats generally start some distance (a few hundred metres/yards, or perhaps several miles/kilometres) above the mill or other destination, where an offtake or sluice gate diverts a proportion of the water from a river or stream. A weir in the source stream often serves to provide a reservoir of water adequate for diversion. The leat then runs along the edge or side of the valley, at a shallower slope than the main stream. The gradient, together with the quality of the wetted surface of the leat, determines the flow rate. The flow rate may be calculated using the Manning formula. By the time it arrives at the water mill the difference in levels between the leat and the main stream is great enough to provide a useful head of water \u2013 several metres (perhaps 5 to 15 feet) for a watermill, or a metre or less (perhaps one to four feet) for the controlled irrigation of a water-meadow.\nWater supply.\nLeats are used to increase the yield of a reservoir by trapping streams in nearby catchments by means of a contour leat. This captures part or all of the stream flow and transports it along the contour to the reservoir. Such leats are common around reservoirs in the uplands of Wales.\nMining.\nLeats were built to work lead, tin and silver ores in mining areas of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, the Pennines and the Leadhills/Wanlockhead area of Southern Scotland from the 17th century onwards. They were used to supply water for hushing mineral deposits, washing ore and powering mills.\nUse in Roman times.\nLeats were also used extensively by the Romans, and can still be seen at many sites, such as the Dolaucothi Gold Mines. They used the aqueducts to prospect for ores by sluicing away the overburden of soil to reveal the bedrock in a method known as hushing. They could then attack the ore veins by fire-setting, quench with water from a tank above the workings, and remove the debris with waves of water, a method still used in hydraulic mining. The water supply could then be used for washing the ore after crushing by simple machines also driven by water.\nThe Romans also used them for supplying water to the bath-houses or thermae and to drive vertical water-wheels.\nDartmoor.\nThere are many leats on Dartmoor, mostly constructed to provide power for mining activities, although some were also sources of drinking water. The courses of many Dartmoor leats may still be followed. Many such leats on the moor are marked on the 1:50000 and 1:25000 Ordnance Survey maps, such as that serving the now-defunct Vitifer mine near the Warren House Inn. Notable leats include:\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

This is opposed to the \"traditional\" INT 10h BIOS calls, which are limited to resolutions of 640\u00d7480 pixels with 16 colour (4-bit) depth or less. VBE is made available through the video card's BIOS, which installs some interrupt vectors that point to itself during boot up.\nMost newer cards implement the more capable VBE 3.0 standard. Older versions of VBE provide only a real mode interface, which cannot be used without a significant performance penalty from within protected mode operating systems. Consequently, the VBE standard has almost never been used for writing a video card's drivers; each vendor has thus had to invent a proprietary protocol for communicating with its own video card. Despite this, it is common that a driver thunk out to the real mode interrupt in order to initialize screen modes and gain direct access to a card's linear frame buffer, because these tasks would otherwise require handling many hundreds of proprietary variations that exist from card to card.\nIn EFI 1.x systems, the INT 10H and the VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE) are replaced by the EFI UGA protocol. In widely used UEFI 2.x systems, the INT 10H and the VBE are replaced by the UEFI GOP.\nStandards.\nEarly VBE.\nVBE 1.0 (VS891001) was defined in 1989. VBE 1.1 (VS900602) was defined in 1990. VBE 1.2 (VS911022) was defined in 1991. These versions of VBE require real mode to work.\nVBE defines several new functions called through INT 10H. The function numbering start with AX=4F00, or (AH=4F, AL=00), for \"Function 00h\". 00h to 05h were defined in VBE 1.0, 06h and 07h in 1.1, and 08h in 1.2.\nVESA BIOS Extensions (VBE core) 2.0 (November 1994).\nThis standard provides the primary functionality of the VESA BIOS Extensions. It allows applications to determine the capabilities of the graphics card and provides the ability to set the display modes that are found. VBE 2.0 adds some new features above the prior VBE 1.2 standard including linear framebuffer access and protected mode banking. Some of the VBE Core 2.0 features include:\nVESA BIOS Extensions (VBE core) 3.0 (September 1998).\nA superset of the VBE 2.0 standard. This standard adds refresh rate control, facilities for stereo glasses, improved multi-buffering and other functions to the VBE 2.0 standard.\nA new \"Protected Mode Entry Point\" was added as an alternative to \"Function 0Ah\". This gives access to all the VBE functions, thus allowing things like changing the graphics mode or setting the logical scan line length from protected mode, which were not possible with the old \"Function 0Ah\".\nVBE/accelerator functions (VBE/AF) (August 1996).\nVBE/AF provides a low-level, standard interface to common acceleration functions available on most hardware. Some of the functions defined in the standard are access to hardware cursors, Bit Block Transfers (Bit Blt), off screen sprites, hardware panning, drawing and other functions. It is defined to work under 32-bit protected mode. Despite the widespread adoption of VBE Core, very few devices support VBE/AF. The https:// project implements free third-party VBE/AF drivers for certain graphics cards.\nSupplemental specifications.\nSupplemental specifications provides device independent interface between application software and Super VGA hardware. Function numbers are assigned by VESA Software Standards Committee (SSC).\nPower management extensions (PM).\nDPMS is a hardware standard that allows graphics cards to communicate with DPMS-compliant monitors via a special signalling system that can be used with existing graphics controllers and monitor cables. This signalling system allows the graphics card to tell the monitor to go into a number of different power management or power saving states, which effectively allow the monitor to turn itself off when it is not in use.\nFlat panel interface extensions (FP).\nAllows access to special features in flat panel controllers.\nAudio interface extensions (AI).\nProvides standard to audio services.\nCurrently (version 1.00), the VBE/AI specification defines three device classes: WAVE, MIDI, and VOLUME. Device types not covered:\nOEM extensions.\nProvides standard entry to vendor-specific extensions.\nDisplay Data Channel (DDC).\nThe Display Data Channel or DDC is a digital connection between a computer display and a graphics adapter that allows the display to communicate its specifications to the adapter. The standard was created by VESA.\nSerial Control Interface (SCI).\nProvides hardware independent means for operating system and application to read and write data over I\u00b2C serial control interface.\nVBE mode numbers.\nAlthough mode number is a 16-bit value, the optional VBE mode numbers are 14 bits wide. Bit 15 is used by VGA BIOS as a flag to clear or preserve display memory.\nVBE defined mode numbers as follows:\nStarting in VBE/Core 2.0, VESA no longer defines new VESA mode numbers and no longer requires a device to implement the old numbers. To properly detect information of a screen mode, use \"Function 01h - Return VBE Mode Information\".\nMode 81FFh is a special video mode designed to preserve current memory contents and give access to the entire video memory.\nModes defined by VESA.\nBeginning with the VBE 2.0 standard, no new modes will be defined by VESA, and old modes are no longer mandatory. The use of defined modes should be considered deprecated: modern video cards may or may not use these mode numbers (even though most do for backward compatibility), and modern software should not use them. The correct way for software to discover available display modes is to obtain a list of modes (using \"Function 00h - Return VBE Controller Information\") and then to check each mode (using \"Function 01h: Return VBE Mode Information\") until it finds the mode/s it requires.\nModes 264\u2013268 are text modes. 264 (0108h) is 80 columns \u00d7 60 rows (80\u00d760), 265 (0109h) is 132\u00d725, 266 (010Ah) is 132\u00d743, 267 (010Bh) is 132\u00d750 and 268 (010Ch) is 132\u00d760. \nOther commonly available graphics modes.\nThe table below combines the modes defined by VESA (the values denoted in black) along with modes commonly used, but which may not work on all graphics cards as they are not defined by any standard (denoted in red).\nMode detection.\nA few tools have been written to detect VBE modes available on a system. They generally work by invoking \"Function 01h\", which is more reliable than assuming a table of extended modes as it's part of the device's self-documentation.\nLinux video mode numbers.\nThe Linux kernel allows the user to select the VESA mode at boot time by passing a code in memory to the kernel. The LILO boot loader passes this code based on a \"vga\" parameter in its configuration file. It takes the form 'vga=XXX', where XXX is the decimal value, or 'vga=0xHHH', where HHH is the hexadecimal value. However, the 'vga=' boot loader parameter does not directly accept VESA video mode numbers; rather, the Linux video mode number is the VESA number plus 512 (in the case of the decimal representation) or plus 0x200 (in the case of the hexadecimal representation). For example, the defined VESA value of 257 (0x101), representing 640x480 and 256 colours, has an equivalent Linux video mode value of 769 (0x301).\nAs indicated earlier, the VESA standard defines a limited set of modes; in particular, none above \u00d7 are covered and, instead, their implementation is completely optional for graphics adapter manufacturers. As vendors are free to utilize whatever additional values they please, this means that, in the table below, the modes denoted in red (and expressed in decimal form) may not apply to every graphics adapter!\nVGA=864 [ 352 (0160h)] also appears to select \u00d7800 (8-bit) for various laptops' displays. &lt;br&gt;\nVGA=834 [ 322 (0142h)] is \u00d7\nModes available in Parallels.\nThe VESA BIOS emulation in the Parallels virtual machine has a different set of non-standard VESA modes. As of build 3214, LRMI vbetest reveals these modes:\nModes available in VirtualBox.\nThe VESA BIOS emulation in the https:// virtual machine has a different set of non-standard VESA modes. As of 6.1.38_Ubuntu build r153438, the VESA BIOS function AX=0x4F01 reveals these modes (See also https://):\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term - originating from the Cornish language \"gonis\" meaning 'working' - is also used when this space breaks the surface of the ground, but it can then be known as a coffin or goffen. It can also be used to describe the deep trenches that were dug by early miners in following the ore-bearing lode downwards from the surface \u2013 in this case they are often called open-works; their existence can provide the earliest evidence of mining in an area. William Pryce, writing in 1778, also used the term as a measure of width, a single gunnies being equal to three feet.\nHistory.\nThat the gunnis was an element of mining in ancient times has been shown by archaeological investigation, such as that performed in the 1990s at Bir Umm Fawakhir, an ancient gold mine in Egypt. The exploration revealed that some 20th-century drives had broken into ancient gunnises which were filled in by rocks that had fractured off the hanging wall, or fallen from above. It was discovered that a wall had been built around one of the gunnises in Roman or Byzantine times to stop material from falling in.\nSome gunnies can be very large: in 1901 a warning was issued in \"The Cornishman\" about the \"immense gunnies\" in Dolcoath mine where there had been a big collapse in 1828 and \"ominous slow movement\" for the last 27 years; a 1934 article in \"The Western Morning News\" related a trip to the cliffs at St Agnes: where after entering a narrow hole, about 150 feet in there was a \"huge excavation ... the top or 'back' [of which] could not be seen, and the depth must have been about 150 to 200 feet, as we could hear the sea roaring away down there [...] This huge \"gunnies\" could have contained a decent sized cathedral.\" The writer recommended that it be made accessible so that the public could admire \"the works of the men [...] whose enterprise, energy, daring and skill are unsurpassed in the history of our country\".\nThe name of the village of Gunnislake in east Cornwall, England, UK, is partly derived from the term: the first record of the name in 1485 is as \"Gonellake\" from a personal name \"Gunna\" and the local word \"lake\" for a stream, but by 1796 the name had changed to its present form as a result of the mining that took place in the area.\nAn 18th-century gunnis at Poldark Mine is mentioned as a notable feature in the successful Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site nomination document of 2004.\nProblems and dangers.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Quote_box/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\"And then I went on, bearing east so far as I recollect. There's a deep gunnies here...\"\"That's so,\" said Ross.\"I climbed across'n \u2013 a plank, 'alf rotten...\"\n\u2014Winston Graham, \"Warleggan\".\nThe large extent and great depth of some gunnies often caused problems when they lay in the way of later mine development. For instance, Joseph Jennings, the former mine manager at East Pool mine wrote in 1916 that in 1908 he had had to bridge the \"gunniss\" of the Great Lode at the 160 fathom level, and that of the New North Lode at the 240 fathom level and install expensive timber stulls to enable the continued development of the mine. These large open underground spaces were the inevitable cause of accidents too: in 1836 a miner was killed at Dolcoath mine when he fell 13 fathoms (about 80 feet) from a \"swing stage\", a platform let down on ropes or chains into a gunnies that was too wide for any available timber to reach from side to side.\nA house of water.\nAnother problem caused to later mining was if a gunnies became flooded, when it would sometimes be called \"a gunnies of water\", but more often \"a house of water\". In his \"Mineralogia Cornubiensis\" of 1778, William Pryce talks of the care taken by miners when they thought they might be digging an adit towards a house of water: they ensured that they used an iron rod to bore a small hole several feet ahead of their main pickaxe excavation; by so doing they received advance warning of breaking into a huge volume of water. Despite this care, Pryce reported that the water pressure could quickly enlarge the small hole and uncontrollably flood the mine; he also stated that men were paid extra money for working in such dangerous areas and that he was aware of miners being killed when doing this.\nThe Victorian author R. M. Ballantyne's novel \"Deep Down; a Tale of the Cornish Mines\" includes a chapter entitled \"Describes 'holing to a house of water' and its terrible consequences.\" In his later book of personal reminiscences entitled \"An Author's Adventures\", Ballantyne states that his visits to the mines of the St Just area of Cornwall in 1868 were an inspiration for his novel. His reminiscences include a mine captain named Jan telling him about a house of water that was discovered in Botallack Mine and how it was cleared.\nThe greatest loss of life in Cornwall caused by \"holing into a house of water\" occurred at Wheal Owles in January 1893. Twenty miners were drowned when the flooded workings of the disused Wheal Drea were breached. This occurred because of former errors in \"dialling\" (the only means of underground surveying available at that time): according to the records, the level in which the breach occurred was being driven \"away\" from the old workings. The Wheal Owles mine was said to have filled from the 120-fathom sump to the 30-fathom sea level in only 20 minutes. After the accident, the only pumping engine on the site was not powerful enough to drain the mine and attempts at fund-raising to install a better one were unsuccessful, so the bodies of those who drowned were never recovered.\nDisposal of waste.\nRather than being kept open, disused gunnies were often used as a convenient site for the disposal of waste rock (known as \"deads\" or \"attle\"). This had the useful side-effect of avoiding the need to support the sides of the gunnies with stulls, especially if the gunnies diverged significantly from the vertical, to avoid the likely collapse of the hanging wall. This was still not an ideal solution, however, because if it became necessary to pass through the filled gunnies in later development of the mine, the problem became one of digging through and supporting tons of loose rock. The 1893 mining accident at Dolcoath in which seven men were killed was caused by failure of the stull holding up a huge quantity of deads in a gunnies.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65359", "revid": "41219559", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65359", "title": "Newquay", "text": "Town in Cornwall, England\nNewquay ( ; ) is a town on the north coast in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is a civil parish, seaside resort, regional centre for aerospace industries with an airport and a spaceport, and a fishing port on the North Atlantic coast, approximately north of Truro and west of Bodmin.\nThe town is bounded to the south by the River Gannel and its associated salt marsh, and to the north-east by the Porth Valley. The western edge of the town meets the Atlantic at Fistral Bay. The town has been expanding inland (south) since the former fishing village of New Quay began to grow in the second half of the nineteenth century.\nAt the 2021 census the population of the parish was 23,626 and the population of the built up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics was 24,545.\nHistory.\nPrehistoric period.\nThere are some pre-historic burial mounds and an embankment on the area now known as \"The Barrowfields\", from Trevelgue. There were once up to fifteen barrows, but now only a few remain. Excavations here have revealed charred cooking pots and a coarse pottery burial urn containing remains of a Bronze Age chieftain, who was buried here up to 3,500years ago.\nIn 1987, evidence of a Bronze Age village was found at \"Trethellan Farm\", a site that overlooks the River Gannel.\nThe first signs of settlement in the Newquay region consist of a late Iron Age hill fort/industrial centre which exploited the nearby abundant resources (including deposits of iron) and the superior natural defences provided by Trevelgue Head. It is claimed that occupation of the site was continuous from the 3rd century BC to the 5th or 6th century AD. A Dark Ages house was later built on the head.\nDomesday Book.\nThe settlement which is now known as Newquay was not mentioned in Domesday Book, although a parcel of land was recorded at Treninnick, which is now part of suburban Newquay. Treninnick was then part of the manor of Coswarth and consisted of one virgate (value 15d) [] with five sheep. The village of Crantock is the only other recognisable name in the Newquay area also recorded in Domesday Book, (as \"Langoroch\").\nFunds to build a \u2018new quay\u2019.\nIn 1439, Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Exeter granted an indulgence to build a new quay from which the town would later derive its modern name. However, this appeal did not succeed, and the harbour remained largely undeveloped until the early 17th century, although it is thought to have had a succession of short wooden piers since the 15th century, and possibly before that.\nMedieval to Early Modern period.\nThe origins of modern Newquay can be traced back to the medieval period to a small cluster of cottages known as \"Towan,\" located where the Central Inn now stands. About 200 meters (660 feet) away was another settlement called \"New Quay,\" referring to a small harbour within the Manor of Towan Blystra. Despite occasional confusion, \"Towan Blystra\" is not a Cornish equivalent of Newquay, and there is no historical record of the name \"Newquay\" being rendered in Cornish. The two settlements were connected by a track that eventually became today's Fore Street. The local economy at the time relied primarily on fishing, agriculture, and some mining activity\nThe earliest mention of a fish market in the area dates back to 1571, found in the Arundell papers. It is believed that this market may have been located in what is now Central Square, though fish trading also likely took place directly at the quay and in nearby cellars. The public house later known as 'The Central' (rebuilt in 1859) became a hub of local trade, with farmers parking wagons of grain in the square and conducting business inside the inn.\nAccording to the accounts and financial reports of the Arundell papers from 1575, there is a mention of 'fysh bought at Newkaye,' which is likely one of the earliest recorded references to Newquay.\nRichard Carew\u2019s Survey of Cornwall, published in 1602, includes the lines: \u201cNeyther may I omit newe Kaye, a place in the North coast of this Hundred, so called, because in former times, the neighbours attempted, to supplie the defect of nature, by Art, in making there a Kay, for the Rode of shipping, which conceyt they still retayne, though want of means in themselves, or the place, have left the effect in Nubibus [unfulfilled].\u201d\nIn 1615, Thomas Stuer, who was Lord of the Manor, applied for permission to build a single pier, and the development of the modern harbour then began.\nThe Huer's Hut.\nThe Huer's Hut at Newquay, Cornwall served as a lookout point from which a man known as a huer could keep watch for the arrival of the pilchards. They could be discerned by the water turning a dark reddish-brown and by the flocks of seagulls which dived down to feed on the fish. The huer would announce the arrival by shouting \"hevva, hevva\" or through the use of a trumpet after which he would direct the townsfolk to the fish by waving tree branches above his head. The word huer has the same derivation as the \"hue\" in hue and cry, after this action.\nThe Huer's Hut at Newquay has been described as \"a particularly fine late mediaeval specimen\". The listed building description states that the current structure dates from the late 18th and early 19th centuries, though a plaque on the structure claims 14th-century origins. The plaque also states that the structure may have been used at an earlier time as a hermitage and lighthouse.\nThe structure was restored in 1836, at which point the fireplace may have been significantly altered. It received protection as a listed building (under the name \"Huer's House\") on 24 October 1951 and is currently categorised as grade II*\nCentral Inn.\nThe origins of the original inn on the site of the present Central Inn are unclear. An inn was recorded on this site in 1755, which was probably built of freestone and topped with a thatched roof, later slate. It served as an early place of trade. In her publication \"Old Newquay,\" Sarah Teague Husband described the inn in the 1850s as being \"two or three hundred years old\" and in a state of disrepair.\nThe inn was rebuilt in 1859, and was known as the Commercial Inn until early in the 20th century.\nDr William Borlase visit in 1755.\nDr William Borlase, who was a Cornish antiquarian and the Rector of Ludgvan, visited Towan Blystra in 1755 during a tour of Cornwall. He wrote: \"Passed the Ganel and went about a mile further to a place of about twelve houses called Towan Blystra, a furlong further to the New Quay in St Columb Parish, here is a little pier, the north point of which is fixed on a rock, the end in a cliff; at the eastern end there is a gap cult [cut] about 25feet wide into the slaty rock of the cliff: This gap lets small ships into a basin which may hold about six ships of about 80tons burthen and at spring tides has 18feet of water in it, upon the brow of the cliff is a dwelling house and a commodious cellar lately built.\"\nThe dwelling house mentioned by Borlase is believed to be referring to 'Quay House' one of the oldest building in the town, the Newquay edition of the Homeland Handbooks book (1931) described it as having a \"picturesque front and low grey roof may be observed beyond a gate marked 'Private'.\"\n19th century.\nThe first national British census of 1801 recorded around 1,300inhabitants in the settlement which would have include the small settlements which would become Newquay (enumerated as a village under St Columb Minor parish).\nIn 1832 the London-based entrepreneur Richard Lomax bought the manor of Towan Blystra. This included the small harbour at what was becoming known as New Quay.\nThe proposal included a description of New Quay and Towan and the unpaved track between the settlements. It also showed some buildings including an inn, (this was rebuilt in 1859 and is now known as The Central), cottages along what would become Bank Street and other structures connected with the fishing industry, such as the cellars, where the fish were dried and packed in barrels. Lomax began the construction of the north and south quay, but he died in 1837 before his harbour had been completed.\nThe harbour was at its most prosperous in the 25years following its purchase in the 1870s by the Cornwall Minerals Railway. In 1872 the middle jetty was added to expand capacity.\nTo the north of the harbour there were fish cellars in the 19th century, where pilchards were salted and packed in casks. The two remaining areas are Fly cellars and Active cellars, although the others have disappeared.\nA mansion called the Tower was built for the Molesworth family in 1835: it included a castellated tower and a private chapel as they were Roman Catholics and no church for that denomination existed in the area. The Tower later became the golf club house. After the arrival of passenger trains in June 1876, the town started to develop with many rows of private houses and hotels began to emerge.\nVictorian hotels.\nSeveral major hotels were built around the end of the 19th century, the first being the Great Western Hotel which opened in 1879 on Station Road, now Cliff Road. The original hotel was enlarged and altered in the 1930s. Other early first-class hotels included the Victoria (1899), the Atlantic (1892) and the Headland (1900) near Fistral, Many smaller hotels were also being opened. Some were created around the turn of the century by converting large houses, many of which had been built originally by wealthy visitors as holiday homes, particularly along Narrowcliff.\n20th century.\nThree churches were built early in the twentieth century, including the present day parish church of St Michael the Archangel, which was consecrated in 1911. Growth of the town eastwards soon reached the area around the railway station: Station Road became Cliff Road around 1930, and the houses beyond, along Narrowcliff, were also converted into hotels. Narrowcliff was known for a while as Narrowcliff Promenade, and then Narrowcliff Road. On some pre-war maps, it is spelt Narrowcliffe.\nAt the time of the First World War the last buildings at the edge of the town were a little further along present-day Narrowcliff. Post-war development saw new houses and streets built in the Chester Road area, accompanied by ribbon development along the country lane which led to St Columb Minor, some away. This thoroughfare was modernised and named Henver Road, also some time in the 1930s. Development continued in this direction until the Second World War, by which time much of Henver Road had houses on both sides, with considerable infilling also taking place between there and the sea.\nA thriving knitting industry became established in Newquay in the early part of the 20th century. In 1905, Madame Hawke began selling machine-knitted garments in a shop in the centre of the town. Debenhams was sent a sample of her work and commissioned her as a supplier. She opened a factory in Crantock Street, which has since been converted into housing. Several competing knitting companies were also set up in the town in this period.\nIn the early 1950s, the last houses were built along Henver Road. After that, there was a virtually continuous building line on both sides of the main road from the other side of St Columb Minor right into the town centre. The Doublestiles estate to the north of Henver Road was also built in the early 1950s, as the name of Coronation Way indicates, and further development continued beyond, becoming the Lewarne Estate and extending the built up area to the edges of Porth.\nOther areas also developed in the period between the wars were Pentire (known for a time as West Newquay) and the Trenance Valley. Other streets dating from the 1920s included St Thomas Road, which provided the approach to the town's new cottage hospital at its far end, to be followed by others in the same area near the station, such as Pargolla Road.\nMore recent development has been on a larger scale: until the late 1960s, a passenger arriving by train would not have seen a building by the line (with the exception of Trencreek village) until the Trenance Viaduct was reached. Today, the urban area starts a good inland from the viaduct. Other growth areas have been on the fringes of St Columb Minor and also towards the Gannel. More development beyond Treninnick, south of the Trenance Valley, has taken the urban area out as far as Lane, where more building is now under way. The Trennnick/Treloggan development, mainly in the 1970s and 1980s, included not merely housing but also an industrial estate and several large commercial outlets, including a major supermarket and a cash and carry warehouse.\n21st century.\nOne of the worst hotel fires in Britain for many years occurred in 2007 at the Penhallow hotel, which overlooked Towan beach. Three people were killed because the hotel management had not complied with fire safety standards. The building was later demolished and replaced by a new structure.\nThe first phase of a new Duchy of Cornwall development began to be built in 2012 at Tregunnel Hill, which was sometimes unofficially called Surfbury after the similar Poundbury development in Dorset. It has 174 houses of traditional designs.\nThere is now a similar but much more substantial development in progress inland, and construction on a large site known as Nansledan ('broad valley' in Cornish) is now well under way, mainly west of the Quintrell Road. Plans were approved for the development of 800homes at Nansledan in December 2013, but the plan now includes more than 4,000homes, shops, a supermarket, church and a 14-classroom primary school which opened to its first pupils in September 2019. Following the example set at Tregunnel Hill, the buildings are again of traditional designs and all street names are in Cornish.\nPlaces like Trencreek, Porth and St Columb Minor have long since become suburbs of Newquay: it had been reported that it was possible that by the 2030s, should present development trends continue, the south eastern edge of the town could stretch beyond the present boundary set by Nansledan and encompass Quintrell Downs, from the town centre. However, the Newquay Neighbourhood Development Plan, which was approved in a referendum held on 6 April 2019, said it was important to retain a 'green buffer' between Newquay and Quintrell Downs.\nIn April 2012, the Aerohub enterprise zone for aerospace businesses was set up at Newquay Airport. In September 2014, the UK's Homes and Communities Agency and the European Regional Development Fund agreed to fund the construction of a \u00a36million Aerohub Business Park there. A plan to launch space vehicles from a new spaceport alongside the airport moved ahead in July 2018, when a contract was signed with Virgin Orbit. The first launch from the spaceport, named Spaceport Cornwall, took place on 9 January 2023. The initial launch of the LauncherOne rocket from the carrier aircraft, \"Cosmic Girl\", was successful but the rocket's second stage suffered an anomaly and the vehicle and payload satellites failed to reach orbit.\nGovernance.\nThere are two tiers of local government covering Newquay, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Newquay Town Council (which styles itself \"Newquay Council\") and Cornwall Council. The town council is based at the Municipal Buildings on Marcus Hill.\nThe Member of Parliament for St Austell and Newquay is Noah Law (Labour), who won the seat in the General Election of 4 July 2024. The previous MP was Steve Double (Conservative) who had been MP for the constituency since it was created in 2010. He was re-elected in 2015 and 2019.\nAdministrative history.\nNewquay historically formed part of the ancient parish of St Columb Minor in the Pydarshire Hundred of Cornwall. In 1868 a Newquay local government district was established, administered by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. In ecclesiastical terms, Newquay remained a chapelry of the ecclesiastical parish of St Columb Minor until 1918.\nThe urban district was enlarged in 1902 and 1934; the 1934 expansion included taking in the neighbouring villages of Crantock and St Columb Minor. In 1957 the urban district council moved its headquarters to the former Manor hotel on Marcus Hill, which became known as the Municipal Buildings.\nNewquay Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, when the area became part of the new borough of Restormel. The area of the former Newquay Urban District became an unparished area as a result of the 1974 reforms. Two new parishes were subsequently created covering the former Newquay Urban District in 1983; Crantock and Newquay. The parish council for Newquay declared that parish to be a town, allowing it to take the name Newquay Town Council and letting the chairperson of the council take the title of mayor.\nRestormel was abolished in 2009. Cornwall County Council then took on district-level functions, making it a unitary authority, and was renamed Cornwall Council.\nGeography.\nClimate.\nAs with the rest of the British Isles and South West England, Newquay experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is St. Mawgan/Newquay Airport, about 3.5 miles to the north east of the town centre. Temperature extremes in the area since 1960 vary from in June 1976 and August 1995 down to during January 1987.\nGeology.\nThe bedrock underlying Newquay is the Devonian age Meadfoot Group, a succession of interbedded mudstones, siltstones and sandstones, with occasional beds of limestone. Quaternary age deposits of blown sand cover the bedrock in the western part of the town. Some mineralisation associated with the Cornubian granite batholith that intrudes into much of the peninsular is found in the western part of the town near Fistral Beach, in the form of lodes of lead and silver minerals.\nEconomy.\nTourism.\nNewquay has been a major tourist destination for more than a century, principally on account of its coastline and nine long and accessible sandy beaches. These include Fistral, which could claim to the best known surfing beach in the British Isles. Around 25,000 people live in Newquay, but the population can increase to 100,000 or more in the summer because Newquay has a large stock of holiday accommodation.\nDuring the 20th century, the town developed in sections, Trenance Leisure Gardens are in a wooded, formerly marshy valley on the quieter edge of Newquay, stretching down to the Gannel Estuary. From the Edwardian era it provided recreation for tourists with walks, tennis courts and a bowling green. The gardens are spanned by a stone railway viaduct which was rebuilt just before the Second World War. The boating lake was dug during the depression of the 1930s, as a work creation scheme. In the late 1960s, further enterprises were established by the council, including mini-golf, a swimming pool, the Little Western Railway miniature railway which opened in 1968 and Newquay Zoo, which opened in 1969.\nNewquay was also known for the \"Run to the Sun\" event, which began on Fistral Beach in 1987 and then took place for many years during the public holiday on the last weekend in May at Trevelgue Holiday Park. People visited the town in Volkswagen camper vans, Volkswagen Beetles and other custom cars. The last RTTS took place in 2014, but in 2023, it was announced that the event would return on 27 May to a new site at St Mawgan, just outside Newquay.\nOther events in recent times have included the large Boardmasters music festival, which attracts another 50,000 visitors over one weekend in early August and is held on sites at Watergate Bay (outside the urban area) and Fistral Beach. Cornwall Pride moved to Newquay from Truro in 2017, and this took place in 2018 on the last Saturday in August.\nThe South West Coast Path runs through the town.\nTown trail.\nNewquay Discovery Trail is made up of 14 Cornish slate discs, each in diameter, sunk into the ground at strategic points around the town. Each of the discs features a series of 'conundrum' words carved by sculptor Peter Martin. The trail starts in the centre of town at the Killacourt.\nSpaceport.\nNewquay has obtained a licence to operate as a spaceport, called Spaceport Cornwall. A decision had been expected about the sites of UK spaceports in the summer of 2017, but the additional general election in June 2017 delayed necessary legislation for a time. Cornwall's bid was supported by Cornwall Council and Cornwall &amp; Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership. The proposal also included the related Cornish space tracking station at Goonhilly, which is near Helston in south Cornwall. On 16 July 2018, a new partnership was announced with Virgin Orbit to create the spaceport, with the intention of launching satellites from Newquay within three years. On the same day, the government confirmed that a grant worth \u00a32million would be available to developing spaceports. The planned first satellite from Newquay, Kernow Sat 1, was to measure ocean pollution and deforestation and was planned to be launched in summer 2022 (in the end, Kernow Sat 1 was not present on the first launch from Spaceport Cornwall in 2023). On 24 February 2022, the then Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, formally launched the construction of a \u00a35.6million Centre for Space Technologies alongside the Spaceport, and the new Centre is expected to create 150 jobs. The first, unsuccessful, attempt to launch satellites took place on 9 January 2023.\nTransport.\nRailway.\nNewquay railway station is the terminus of the Atlantic Coast Line from Par. The railway was originally built as a mineral line in the 1840s and ran mainly around the fringes of the built-up area, as it was then, to the harbour. A passenger service followed on 20 June 1876, and from then on the town developed quickly as a resort. The station is close to the beaches on the eastern side of the town centre.\nNewquay has daily direct services to and from Plymouth, Exeter and London between May and September. It is the only branch line terminus in Britain still served by scheduled intercity trains. Passenger services are currently operated under government contract by Great Western Railway, whose owner is FirstGroup.\nHistory.\nThe goods line which would be acquired later by the Cornwall Minerals Railway was opened in 1846 from inland mines to the harbour, and was worked by horses. Parts of the old line from the present station to the harbour are still in existence: the most obvious section is a broad footpath from opposite the station in Cliff Road to East Street, known locally as the \"tram track\", and complete with a very railway-style overbridge. From East Street, the line continued towards the harbour along the present-day Manor Road.\nThe last trains ran through to Newquay Harbour in about 1924, but general goods traffic continued to reach Newquay railway station until 1964. The passenger station and its approaches were enlarged more than once, with additional carriage sidings being built at Newquay in the 1930s. The originally wooden viaduct just outside the station, which crosses the Trenance Valley, was rebuilt in 1874 to allow locomotives to run over the structure and then again just before World War II to carry double track, which extended until 1964 for approximately to Tolcarn Junction. The line is now single again, but the width of the viaduct is still obvious.\nTolcarn Junction was the point where a second passenger route left the Par line between 1906 and 1963. This branch ran to Chacewater, west of Truro, via Perranporth and St Agnes, and provided through trains to Truro and Falmouth.\nTwo of the three former platforms were taken out of use in 1987.\nMid Cornwall Metro.\nThe Mid Cornwall Metro received provisional approval for government funding worth almost \u00a350million on 18 January 2023, and the project was approved by Cornwall Council in December 2023, on condition that budgets are kept under control.\nA second platform was restored at Newquay in early 2025 and there will be other improvements to the terminus as well as upgraded signalling and an additional crossing place (a section of double track) at Tregoss Moor, between St Columb Road and Roche stations. This crossing place, , was laid during a month-long closure of the line in March 2025. The MCM will provide a clockface hourly service between Newquay, Par, St Austell, Truro and Falmouth Docks.\nWork is now under way. The frequency of trains to Par had been due to be doubled to hourly in May 2025, but this improvement has been delayed until later in the year. Newquay services are set to be extended to Truro and Falmouth in 2026.\nAirport.\nNewquay Airport provides links to many other parts of the United Kingdom. It is an HM Customs port because it also handles increasing numbers of foreign flights, both scheduled and chartered. Newquay is the principal airport for Cornwall, although there are several minor airfields elsewhere in the county.\nUntil 2008, Newquay Civil Airport (as it was formerly known) used the runway and other facilities of RAF St Mawgan, but in December 2008 the Ministry of Defence handed over most of the site to the recently formed Cornwall Airport Limited. The first stage of the conversion into a fully commercial airport was completed in 2011, although further substantial development is planned. The handover, which was due to take place at the end of 2008, was delayed for almost three weeks because of problems in obtaining the essential Civil Aviation Authority licence, which was withheld until further work had been carried out.\nThe name has changed several times since 2008, and the airport is now marketed as Cornwall Airport Newquay. However, the IATA code is still NQY.\nUsage of the airport had been rising sharply until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020\u201322. On summer Saturdays in 2018, there were almost 50 arrivals and departures, including flights to Germany and other continental countries.\nBus.\nThe bus station is in Manor Road, which runs parallel to the shopping area in Bank Street. A scheme to upgrade and improve the bus station with the additions of a new enclosed waiting area and accessible toilet began in February 2018 and was completed in July. Further changes occurred in April and May 2020, because Cornwall Council had awarded an eight-year contract to run subsidised services in the county to Go Cornwall, which also operates as Plymouth CityBus and is owned by the Go-Ahead Group.\nThere are regular bus services from Newquay to many parts of Cornwall, including the neighbouring urban centres of St Austell and Truro as well as Padstow, Perranporth, Redruth, St Columb Major and Wadebridge. In addition, there are several local services, including an hourly night bus service on Saturday nights/Sunday mornings to St Columb Major and Fraddon during the peak summer months. Buses are operated by FirstGroup and Go Cornwall Bus while the town is also served by National Express.\nGo Cornwall operates frequent services in the high summer to and from a park and ride site by the A392, opposite Hendra Holiday Park.\nIn November 2025, First Group had announced that they would cease their Bus services in Cornwall by 16 February 2026, due to ongoing financial challenges.\nEducation.\nNewquay has one higher education campus, Newquay University Centre, which is a member of the Combined Universities in Cornwall Partnership. It offers foundation degree courses in Zoological Conservation, Marine Aquaculture, Animal Science and Wildlife Education and Media. Appropriately, the campus is close to Newquay Zoo in the Trenance Valley. There are also two secondary schools: Newquay Tretherras is a state-funded academy with specialist Technology College status, and Treviglas Academy is a specialist Business and Enterprise College.\nA new centre of higher education for Newquay had been planned alongside the Airport and Spaceport (see Transport) in 2020, to be known as the International Aviation Academy and attached to RAF St Mawgan. It was hoped to cater for students who wish to gain air- or space-related qualifications. The project was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and no further announcements have been made.\nSecond World War.\nAmong many schools evacuated to Cornwall (notably Benenden Girls' School), 240 boys and 20 masters of Gresham's School were evacuated to the town from Holt, Norfolk, during the Second World War, between June 1940 and March 1944. Gresham's occupied the Bay Hotel and the Pentire Hotel.\nBetween 1940 and 1944, the Royal Air Force used hotels in Newquay as a Ground school for aircrew Initial Training Wings No 7, No 8, and No 40. Recruits were taught basic flying theory and service protocols, and were sorted into their likely future RAF trades, such as Pilots, Observers, Navigators, Wireless operators, and air gunners. The training took place in the Highbury Hotel and men were billeted in nearby hotels.\nSeveral hotels were requisitioned as convalescent hospitals for the Army, Air Force, and Royal Navy. These were the Atlantic Hotel, the Headland Hotel, the Hotel Victoria, the Fistral Bay Hotel and St Rumons (later renamed the Esplanade).\nReligious sites.\nNon-conformist.\nThe first Methodist preaching at Newquay was recorded by Richard Treffry in 1802, an innkeeper, Carter, being the host. In 1810, preacher William O'Bryan came to Newquay and formed the nucleus of the first Methodist society. The society, later known as the Bible Christians or 'Bryanites', built a chapel in 1851. In 1907, following the amalgamation of the Methodist New Connexion, Bible Christians, and United Methodist Free Churches into the United Methodist Church, the chapel was renamed the Sydney Road United Methodist Church.The Methodist Union of 1932 further unified various Methodist denominations, and the chapel became known as the Sydney Road Methodist Chapel. It continued to serve the local congregation until its closure around 1977. Subsequently, the building was demolished, and the site was redeveloped for housing and a car park.\nThe Baptists were the first to have a building. The Newquay Baptist Church, formerly the Ebenezer Baptist Chapel founded in 1822, is one of the oldest religious buildings in Newquay. The worshippers at Ebenezer were Strict and Particular, or Calvinistic Baptists. Before the Baptist chapel was built the Strict Baptists formed themselves into a community and met for worship in the old malthouse opposite Primrose cottage on Beach Road. They had a regular Sunday supply of preachers from Plymouth, Torquay, and Truro.\nThe first Methodist chapel was built in 1833, at a cost of \u00a3170. In 1849, following a division within the Methodist movement, a significant portion of the congregation left to establish the Wesley Hill Chapel in 1852. The remaining members continued at Crantock Street until 1865, when they moved to the United Methodist Chapel on Marcus Hill, known as Steps Chapel. Following a visit by General Bramwell Booth in 1924, the building was taken over by the Salvation Army in 1926.\nThe Wesleyan Methodist Church in Newquay, built in 1904, was designed in Gothic style by the architectural firm Bell, Withers, and Meredith. It served the growing Methodist community. Renamed the Newquay Wesleyan Methodist Chapel after the Methodist Church unification in 1932, it closed in 2009 due to declining congregations and was sold to the Elim Pentecostal Church. The Grade II listed building remains a key historical landmark.\nRoman Catholic.\nThe Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity is earlier, having been built in 1903. Until 1985, it was dependent on monks from Bodmin but then became part of the Diocese of Plymouth.\nParish Church.\nThe first Anglican chapel was built in Newquay in 1858, as a chapel of ease, in a fine Cornish Perpendicular style; it was known as St Michael's due to the dedication of a side chapel. The parish itself was created in 1882 from part of St Columb Minor parish. By 1896, St Michael's Church had been twice enlarged, a north and a south aisle being added, and its capacity increased to 500. By the turn of the 19th century, however, it was quite inadequate to hold the summer congregation. The cramped and inconvenient site meant that no further enlargement of the chapel was possible, and it seemed inevitable that a new church would have to be built on a different site. The present church, the Newquay Parish Church of St Michael the Archangel is dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, was originally designed by Ninian Comper and built in 1910\u20131911, but the tower not completed until the 1960s. Arthur Mee, in his \"Cornwall\" volume of the King's England series, describes the perpetual light maintained in the church as a memorial to the men of Newquay who died in the First World War. The stained glass windows and rood screen are also described: the main themes are St Michael, the three other archangels, and Jesus Christ and Mary the Blessed Virgin. The St Michael, chapel-of-ease continued to serve the people of Newquay until 1911 when the chapel was sold to the Women's Institute which owned it for a number of years until it was sold again to FW Woolworth for a new store. The chapel was demolished in 1937.\nPublic Services.\nEmergency services.\nDevon and Cornwall Constabulary maintains a substantial police station in Tolcarne Road. The modern fire station in Tregunnel Hill is run by Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service, and is the home of one of the two aerial ladder platforms based in Cornwall. The fire station has 24-hour cover during the summer and is day-staffed in the winter. A separate specialist fire service is maintained at Newquay Airport.\nAmbulance cover is provided by the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust from an Ambulance Station in St Thomas Road. Cornwall Air Ambulance is also based just outside the town, alongside the airport. In addition, the airport at Newquay is one of ten UK bases for the Search and Rescue service, which is run by Bristow Helicopters on behalf of HM Coastguard.\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution's Newquay Lifeboat Station is at the harbour. There is also a coastguard rescue team based at Treloggan Industrial Park.\nNewquay Community Hospital.\nNewquay Hospital was opened in 1931 at the end of St Thomas Road. It is a community hospital catering for both in- and outpatients, with a number of clinics and a minor injuries unit. Cornwall's only general hospital and full accident and emergency department is in Truro.\nProposals in recent years for the Newquay Growth Area, east of the present town, have included a new and larger hospital.\nSport and leisure.\nNewquay has one non-league association football club - Newquay A.F.C. play at the Mount Wise Stadium. Godolphin Atlantic F.C. used to play on Godolphin Way until the club was dissolved in January 2023.\nNewquay Hornets rugby football club play at Newquay Sports Centre.\nNewquay has a four-team cricket club, also based at the sports centre. Their 1st XI compete in Cornwall's County One, winning the ECB Cornwall Premier League in 2003. Newquay's academy has produced four full-Cornwall players \u2014 Rob Harrison, Neil Ivamy, Joe Crane and Adam Cocking, in addition to numerous County youth representatives. There are several youth teams, ranging from Under 9 to Under 19.\nNewquay plays host to the Newquay Road Runners, who are again based at the sports centre.\nNewquay has been a centre for Cornish wrestling in the past. Venues for tournaments have included the New Hotel Meadow, Mount Wise recreation ground, the Red Lion Field and the Tower Meadow on Tower Road. The Interceltic games were hosted by Newquay in 1936, 1948, 1951, 1965 and 1975.\nSurfing.\nNewquay is widely regarded as the surf capital of the UK, and is therefore also a centre for the surf industry in Britain. There are many surf stores, board manufacturers and hire shops in the town.\nAt the centre of Newquay's surfing status is Fistral Beach which has a reputation as one of the best beach breaks in Cornwall. Fistral is capable of producing powerful, hollow waves and holding a good sized swell.\nFistral Beach has been host to international surfing competitions for around 20 years now. The annual Boardmasters Festival takes place at Fistral beach, with a music festival taking place at Watergate Bay.\nNewquay is also home to the reef known as the Cribbar. With waves breaking at up to , the Cribbar was until recently rarely surfed as it requires no wind and huge swell to break. It was first surfed in September 1965 by Rodney Sumpter, Bob Head and Jack Lydgate and again in 1966, by Pete Russell, Ric Friar and Johnny McElroy and American Jack Lydgate. The recent explosion in interest in surfing large waves has seen it surfed more frequently by South African born Chris Bertish, who during a succession of huge clean swells in 2004, surfed the biggest wave ever seen there.\nTowan, Great Western and Tolcarne beaches nearer the town and nearby Crantock and Watergate Bay also provide high quality breaks.\nIn 2011, an artificial reef was proposed in Newquay to increase the swell and frequency of waves for surfers. However, it lost council support after local rowing clubs and fishermen protested against it. \n\"See \"\nTwinning.\nNewquay is twinned with Dinard in Brittany, France.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65370", "revid": "48666440", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65370", "title": "Gloucester", "text": "Gloucester ( ) is a cathedral city, non-metropolitan district and the county town of Gloucestershire in the South West of England. Gloucester lies on the River Severn, between the Cotswolds to the east and the Forest of Dean to the west; it is sited 7 miles (12\u00a0km) from Cheltenham, from Monmouth, from Bristol, and east of the border with Wales. Gloucester has a population of around 132,000, including suburban areas. It is a port, linked via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal to the Severn Estuary.\nGloucester was founded by the Romans and became an important city and \"colony\" in AD 97, under Emperor Nerva as \"Colonia Glevum Nervensis\".\nIt was granted its first charter in 1155 by Henry\u00a0II. In 1216, Henry\u00a0III, aged only nine years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of Gloucester Cathedral. Gloucester's significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter's Abbey, founded in 679 (later Gloucester Cathedral); the nearby St Oswald's Priory, founded in the 880s or 890s; and Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded in 1136. The town is also the site of the siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces in the First English Civil War.\nA major attraction of the city is Gloucester Cathedral, which is the burial place of King Edward II and Walter de Lacy; it features in scenes from the \"Harry Potter\" films. Other features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former county jail (on the site of a Saxon and Norman castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the County Council) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a chalybeate spring having been discovered in 1814.\nEconomically, the city is dominated by the service industries and has strong financial, research, distribution and light industrial sectors. Historically, it was prominent in the aerospace industry.\nIn 1926, the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company at Brockworth changed its name to the Gloster Aircraft Company because international customers claimed that the name \"Gloucestershire\" was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester's aviation history and its involvement in the jet engine.\nToponymy.\nFrom the city's Roman name, \"Glevum\", Anglo-Saxon migrants after 410, with their fledgling feudal structure, the Kingdom of Wessex, replaced the area's Romano-Celtic society and changed the city's name to (), Gloucester's name in modern Welsh, while recognising the presence of the Roman fort. is a compound of , meaning 'fort, stronghold, castle', and , a lenition of as it would have been pronounced by many speakers, meaning 'bright, shiny, glowy'.\nA variant of the term \"-cester/chester/caster\" instead of the Welsh was eventually adopted. The name Gloucester thus means roughly \"bright fort\". Mediaeval orthographies include \"Caer Glow\", \"Gleawecastre\" and \"Gleucestre\".\nThis etymology was first suggested by the Austrian philologist, Alfred Holder, in 1896. An alternative etymology has been proposed, which argues that the first element of the place-name is related to a Welsh word signifying 'valiant', rendering 'Gloucester' to mean 'fortress of the valiant'.\nHistory.\nRoman Gloucester.\nGlevum was established around AD 48 at an important crossing of the River Severn and near to the Fosse Way, the early front line after the Roman invasion of Britain. Initially, a Roman fort was established at present-day Kingsholm. Twenty years later, a larger legionary fortress was built on slightly higher ground nearby, centred on present-day Gloucester Cross, and a civilian settlement grew around it. Probably the Roman Legion XX Valeria Victrix was based here until 66 and then Legio II Augusta as they prepared to invade Roman Wales between 66 and 74 AD, who stayed later until around 87.\nGloucester became a \"Colonia\" in 97 as \"Colonia Nervia Glevensium\", or \"Glevum\", in the reign of Nerva. It is likely that Glevum became the provincial capital of Britannia Prima.\nWithin about 15 years new privately constructed properties replaced the earlier barracks and public buildings, temples and bath houses were under construction in stone. Piped water began to be supplied. Drains and sewers were laid. On the site of the legionary \"principia\" an imposing central \"forum\" was laid out surrounded by colonnades and flanked on three sides by part-timbered ranges of shops. Closing off the south of the forum was the 100m x 40m Basilica. Many fine homes with mosaic floors were built in the town.\nAt its height, Glevum may have had a population of as many as 10,000 people. The entire area around Glevum was intensely Romanised in the second and third centuries with a higher than normal distribution of villas.\nAt the end of the third century or the start of the fourth, major changes were made to the city's second-century wall. It was replaced in two stages by a stronger and higher one of stone resting on massive reused stone blocks. In the second stage, the blocks rested on deep timber foundation piles. Stone external towers were added; two parallel wide ditches were also cut in front of the new walls.\nRemains of the Roman city can still be seen:\nPost-Roman Gloucester.\nWithdrawal of all Roman forces and many societal leaders in about the year 410 may have allowed leading families of the Dobunni tribe to regain power within the now Roman-influenced, interconnected and intermixed Celtic Brythonic local people. This intermix is reflected by the fact a large minority of basic words and available synonyms in Welsh have a Latin base. In the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" Gloucester is shown as part of Wessex from the Battle of Deorham in 577. At some point afterwards, along with the rest of its shire excluding the Forest of Dean, Gloucester was part of the minor kingdom of the Hwicce. In 628, as a result of the Battle of Cirencester, that kingdom became a client or sub-kingdom of Mercia. From about 780, the Hwicce was no longer feigning any pretence as a kingdom and became part of Mercia. Mercia, allied by matrimony and sharing a desire to counter the Danish onslaught as had conquered swathes of the wider island at large, submitted to Alfred the Great's Kingdom of Wessex in about 877\u2013883. A 20th-century writer intuitively adds that Roman stem Gleu- Glev- was, doubtless, pronounced without any final consonant. \"Claudia Castra\" is mentioned in the 18th century as a possible Latin name related to the city.\nThe first bridging point on a navigable, defensive barrier, great river and the foundation in 681 of the abbey of St Peter by \u00c6thelred of Mercia, favoured town growth; and before the Norman conquest of England, Gloucester was a borough governed by a portreeve, with a castle which was frequently a royal residence, and a mint. In the early 10th century, the remains of Saint Oswald were brought to a small church here and shrine built there, a draw for pilgrims. The core street layout is thought to date to the reign of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in late Saxon times.\nIn 1051, Edward the Confessor held court at Gloucester and was threatened there by an army led by Godwin, Earl of Wessex, but the incident resulted in a standoff rather than a battle.\nMiddle ages.\nAfter the Norman Conquest, William Rufus made Robert Fitzhamon the first baron or overlord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon had a military base at Cardiff Castle, and for the succeeding years the history of Gloucester was closely linked to that of Cardiff.\nDuring the Anarchy, Gloucester was a centre of support for the Empress Matilda, who was supported in her claim to the throne by her half-brother, Fitzhamon's grandson, Robert, 1st Earl of Gloucester (also known as Robert of Gloucester). After this period of strife ended with the ascent of her son Henry to the throne Henry II of England, Henry granted Robert possession of Cardiff Castle, and it later passed to William Fitz Robert, 2nd Earl of Gloucester son of Robert. The story of the Anarchy is vividly told in a series of 19th-century paintings by William Burges at the Castle.\nHenry granted Gloucester its first charter in 1155, which gave the burgesses the same liberties as the citizens of London and Winchester. A second charter of Henry\u00a0II gave them freedom of passage on the River Severn. The first charter was confirmed in 1194 by King Richard\u00a0I. The privileges of the borough were greatly extended by the charter of King John (1200), which gave freedom from toll throughout the kingdom and from pleading outside the borough.\nIn 1216, King Henry III, aged only ten years, was crowned with a gilded iron ring in the Chapter House of Gloucester Cathedral. During his reign, Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany his cousin was briefly imprisoned at Gloucester Castle as state prisoner from 1222 to 1223, and from 1237 to 1238, in addition to sometime during the reign of King John.\nGloucester's significance in the Middle Ages is underlined by the fact that it had a number of monastic establishments, including St Peter's Abbey founded in 679 (later Gloucester Cathedral), the nearby St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester founded in the 880s or 890s, Llanthony Secunda Priory, founded 1136 as a retreat for a community of Welsh monks (now near the western bypass), the Franciscan Greyfriars community founded in 1231 (near Eastgate Shopping Centre), and the Dominican Blackfriars community founded in 1239 (Ladybellegate Street). It also has some very early churches including St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester near the Cathedral and the Norman St Mary de Crypt Church, Gloucester in Southgate Street.\nAdditionally, there is evidence of a Jewish community in Gloucester as early as 1158\u20131159; they lived around present-day East Gate Street and had a synagogue on the south side, near St Michael's church. Gloucester was probably the home of Rabbi Moses, who established an important Anglo-Jewish family. The Jews of the town were falsely accused by the Dominican monks of murdering a child, Harold of Gloucester, in an attempt to establish a cult similar to that of William of Norwich, which failed entirely. Nevertheless, the accusations were recycled around the time of the Edict of Expulsion. In January 1275, Eleanor of Provence expelled Jews from all of the towns within her dower lands, and the Jews of Gloucester were ordered to move to Bristol but finding an especially difficult situation there, relocated to Hereford.\n In the Middle Ages, the main export was wool, which came from the Cotswolds and was processed in Gloucester; other exports included leather and iron (tools and weapons). Gloucester also had a large fishing industry at that time.\nIn 1222, a massive fire destroyed part of Gloucester.\nOne of the most significant periods in Gloucester's history began in 1378 when Richard II convened Parliament in the city. Parliaments were held there until 1406 under Henry\u00a0IV of England. The Parliament Rooms at the Cathedral remain as testimony to this important time.\nGloucester was incorporated by King Richard III in 1483, the town being made a county in itself.\nEarly modern era to contemporary period.\nThe city's charter was confirmed in 1489 and 1510, and other charters of incorporation were received by Gloucester from Queen Elizabeth I and King James I. Princess Mary visited Gloucester in September 1525 accompanied by her ladies and gentlewomen. She was met by the Mayor, John Rawlins, at Quedgeley. Her father Henry VIII and his then Queen, Anne Boleyn, visited in July 1535. They used Gloucester as a base for hunting trips to Painswick, Coberley, and Miserden. They left Gloucester for Leonard Stanley, on their way to Berkeley Castle.\nGloucester was the site of the execution by burning of John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester, in the time of Queen Mary in 1555. In 1580, Gloucester was awarded the status of a port by Queen Elizabeth I.\nThe 16th and 17th centuries saw the foundation of two of Gloucester's grammar schools: the Crypt School in 1539 and Sir Thomas Rich's School in 1666. Both still flourish as grammar schools today, along with Ribston Hall and Denmark Road High School.\nDuring the English Civil War, the fall of nearby Bristol encouraged the reinforcement of the existing town defences. The siege of Gloucester commenced in 1643 in which the besieged parliamentarians emerged victorious. The Royalist's plan of bombardment and tunnelling to the east gate failed due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery and the besieged sniping and conducting artillery fire on the Royalist encampment.\nBy the mid-17th century, only the gatehouse and keep of Gloucester Castle remained, the latter of which was being used as a gaol until it was deemed unsuitable and demolished in the late 1780s. By 1791, the new gaol was completed leaving no trace of the former castle.\nIn the 19th century, the city grew with new buildings including Wellington Parade and the Grade II listed Picton House (c. 1825).\nThe 1896 Gloucester smallpox epidemic affected some 2000 residents.\nDuring the Second World War, two petroleum storage depots were constructed in Gloucester. A Government Civil Storage depot with six 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks was constructed on the Berkeley Canal in 1941/42 by Shell-Mex and BP and connected to the pipeline that ran from the Mersey to the Avon. It was also connected to the Air Force Reserve Depot and a Shell Mex and BP facility for road and rail loading. Due to severe tank corrosion, it was demolished in 1971/2 and disposed of in 1976. The second depot was an Air Force Reserve Depot with four 4,000-ton semi-buried tanks constructed in 1941/42 by Shell, Shell-Mex and BP at the Monk Meadow Dock on the Canal. Originally, delivery was by road, rail and barge and pipeline. It was also connected to the docks and to the Shell Mex and BP installation for rail and road loading facilities and the civil storage site. It was transferred from the Air Ministry to the Ministry of Power in 1959, closed in the 1990s and disposed of in the later 2000s.\nGloucester's most important citizens include Robert Raikes (founder of the Sunday School movement) who is still commemorated by the name of Robert Raikes' House in Southgate Street. Its most infamous citizen was Fred West.\nIn July 2007, Gloucester was hit badly by a flood that struck Gloucestershire and its surrounding areas. Hundreds of homes were flooded, but the event was most memorable because of its wider impact\u00a0\u2013 about 40,000 people were without power for 24 hours, and the entire city (plus surrounding areas) was without piped water for 17 days.\nIn 2009, Gloucester Day was revived as an annual day of celebration of Gloucester's history and culture. The day originally dates from the lifting of the Siege of Gloucester in 1643, during which the city held out against Royalist forces during the First English Civil War.\nCoat of arms.\nGloucester is one of the few cities in England with two coats of arms. The first consists of three chevrons surrounded by ten roundels. The chevrons come from the arms of the Clare family, who were earls of Gloucester from the 12th to the 14th centuries, while the roundels come from the arms of the Bishop of Worcester, whose bishopric historically encompassed Gloucester. This coat is the older of the two, though it is usually termed the \"Commonwealth coat\", as it was not officially granted to the city until 1652, during the Commonwealth period. The crest and supporters (lions bearing broadswords and trowels) were also adopted at this time, along with the motto \"Fides Invicta Triumphat\" (\"unconquered faith triumphs\", in reference to the royalist siege withstood by the city in 1643).\nThe second coat, termed the \"Tudor coat\", was granted in 1538. It features the roses of York and Lancaster, the boar's head of Richard\u00a0III, a ceremonial sword and cap, and two horseshoes surrounded by nails, to represent Gloucester's historical association with ironworking.\nAlthough grants made by Commonwealth heralds were nullified after the Restoration, the Commonwealth coat continued to be used by the city rather than the Tudor coat. The Commonwealth coat, along with the crest and supporters, was legally granted to the city by letters patent dated 16 April 1945. This was reconfirmed in 1974 following the local government changes of that year.\nGovernance.\nThere are two tiers of local government covering Gloucester, at district (city) and county level: Gloucester City Council and Gloucestershire County Council. The Quedgeley area of the city is a civil parish with a town council, forming a third tier of local government; the remainder of the city is an unparished area.\nHistory.\nGloucester was an ancient borough, being treated as a borough from Saxon times and being granted its first known borough charter by Henry II in 1155. In 1483 the town of Gloucester was given the right to appoint its own magistrates, making it a county corporate, administratively independent from the surrounding county of Gloucestershire. When the Diocese of Gloucester was founded in 1541, the town was given the right to call itself a city. The city was reformed to become a municipal borough in 1836 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Gloucester was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a county borough, independent from Gloucestershire County Council.\nGloucester Guildhall at 23 Eastgate Street was built in 1892 and served as the city's administrative headquarters until 1986, when the council moved to North Warehouse at Gloucester Docks.\nOn 1 April 1974, the modern district of Gloucester was formed under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the same area as the abolished County Borough of Gloucester. The reforms also saw the city become subordinate to Gloucestershire County Council, losing the independence it had held since 1483. The parish of Quedgeley was subsequently transferred into Gloucester from Stroud District in 1991. Quedgeley retains its own parish council, unlike the rest of Gloucester, which is an unparished area. In 2017, Quedgeley Parish Council changed its name to Quedgeley Town Council, making it a town within a city.\nGeography.\nGloucester is the county town of Gloucestershire, and is the 53rd largest settlement in the United Kingdom by population. In 2010, its population was 123,400. It has the traditional lowest bridging point of the longest river in Great Britain, connecting it with Over. The 2011 census recorded that the city had a population of 121,921 and by 2016 its population was estimated to be 128,488. The city's urban area extends beyond its boundaries, with . The 2021 census gave the population of the Gloucester Urban Area as 169,061, absorbing areas such as Brockworth and Churchdown.\nThe city is located on the eastern bank of the River Severn, sheltered by the Cotswolds to the east, while the Forest of Dean and the Malvern Hills rise to the west and north, respectively. Gloucester is an inland port, linked via the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal which runs from Gloucester's docks to the Severn Estuary, allowing larger ships to reach the docks than would be possible on the tidal reaches of the river itself, which go well north of the city to Haw Bridge. The wharfs, warehouses and the docks themselves fell into disrepair until their renovation in the 1980s. They now form a public open space. Some warehouses now house the Gloucester Waterways Museum, others were converted into residential flats, shops and bars. Additionally, the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum is located in the Custom House.\nGloucester is made up of a variety of neighbourhoods, some of which correspond to electoral divisions of the City Council.\n\u2020 Quedgeley is the only town within the city's borders. Because of this it has its own town council.\nGreen belt.\nThe city itself contains no green belt; however, it is bordered to the north east by the green belt in the surrounding Tewkesbury district, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion towards Cheltenham and Innsworth, as well as protecting smaller nearby villages such as Churchdown, Badgeworth, Shurdington, and Twigworth.\nPotential merger of Cheltenham and Gloucester.\nIn May 2024, under plans by Gloucestershire County Council, it was reported that there are secret talks to formally merge the conurbations of Cheltenham and Gloucester with each other. The plans suggest that around ten new garden towns could be built around the green belt at Boddington which if removed would result in the complete merger of both boroughs. Doing so would facilitate and effectively merge the two into a supercity. The move has been criticised by both Cheltenham Borough Council and Gloucester City Council.\nAttractions.\nGloucester Cathedral, in the north of the city near the river, originates in the foundation of an abbey dedicated to Saint Peter in 681. It is the burial place of King Edward II and Walter de Lacy. The cathedral (mainly its cloisters) was used for corridor scenes in the films \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\" and \"Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince\". The crypt was used for a scene in \"Sherlock\" Christmas special. Attached to the deanery is the Norman prior's chapel. In St Mary's Square outside the Abbey gate, the Bishop of Gloucester, Bishop John Hooper, was martyred under Queen Mary I in 1555.\nA good number of medieval and Tudor period gabled and half timbered houses survive from earlier periods of Gloucester's history. At the point where the four principal streets intersected stood the Tolsey (town hall), which was replaced by a modern building in 1894. None of the old public buildings are left except for the New Inn in Northgate Street. It is a timbered house, with strong, massive external galleries and courtyards. It was built around 1450 by John Twyning, a monk.\nKings Square is at the heart of the city centre and occupies what was once a cattle market and bus station. Officially opened in 1972, it was the centrepiece of a radical redesign of the city, The Jellicoe Plan, which was first proposed in 1961. It stands beside the Debenham's (formerly Bon March\u00e9) store built in the early 1960s. Many of the features of the redevelopment have since been dismantled; the brutalist concrete fountains in the middle of the square have gone and the overhead roadways which linked three multi storey car parks around the centre have been either closed or dismantled. The main bus station received a Civic Trust Award in 1963 but has since been demolished, with a new bus station being constructed on the same site during 2018. In 2012 a \u00a360 million plan was unveiled to revamp the square. In 2014, the prominent Golden Egg restaurant was demolished and a new look public space was created. A prior archaeological dig revealed a Roman house underneath.\nAn indoor market opened in Eastgate Street in 1968, followed by the Eastgate Shopping Centre in 1973. The Kings Walk Shopping Centre was built between 1969 and 1972. The corner of Eastgate Street and Brunswick Road was redeveloped around this time; Roman remains unearthed below street level in 1974 may be seen through a glass observation panel outside the Boots building, which opened in 1980. The HSBC building on the Cross was renovated and a modern extension added to the Westgate Street aspect in 1972 which received a Civic Trust Award. Sainsbury's opened a supermarket in Northgate Street in 1970; it retains its original interior. Opposite, Tesco opened a large two-storey supermarket in June 1976 on the site of a demolished chapel. This is now occupied by Wilkinson's after Tesco moved to Quedgeley in 1984. Asda opened its first store in Gloucester in Bruton Way in 1983.\nGloucester Leisure Centre opened on the corner of Eastgate Street and Bruton Way in September 1974 and was redeveloped and rebranded (as \"GL1\") in August 2002. Gloucester Central railway station was rebuilt in 1977 to serve both the original traffic to that railway station and the services from the closed Gloucester Eastgate railway station (former Midland Railway) which had stood on another site further east along the same road. Opposite the station stands one of the city's largest office blocks, Twyver House, opened in 1968, which houses the regional Land Registry. The main shopping streets were pedestrianised in the late 1980s.\nThe 1966 \"Heights Plan for Gloucester\" sought to restrict construction of tall buildings and defend spiritual values by protecting views of Gloucester Cathedral. The tower of Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, started in 1970 and completed in August 1975, can be seen from miles around. In Brunswick Road, a brown concrete tower, which housed classrooms at the Gloucestershire College of Arts and Technology (now moved to a site near Llanthony Bridge). The tower was added incongruously to the existing 1930s Technical College buildings in 1971 which has now been demolished. Clapham Court, a tall block of flats, stands in Columbia Close, between London Road and Kingsholm Road. It was built in 1963 and stands on what was once Columbia Street in a small district formerly known as Clapham.\nOther features of interest include the museum and school of art and science, the former county jail (on the site of a Saxon and Norman castle), the Shire Hall (now headquarters of the County Council) and the Whitefield memorial church. A park in the south of the city contains a spa, a chalybeate spring having been discovered in 1814. West of this, across the canal, are the remains (a gateway and some walls) of Llanthony Secunda Priory, a cell of the mother abbey in the Vale of Ewyas, Monmouthshire, which in the reign of King Edward IV became the secondary establishment.\nThe city's Northgate and Southgate streets feature a series of public art mosaic panels depicting Gloucester's medieval trades made by artists Gary Drostle and Rob Turner in 1998 and 1999. Eastgate and Westgate streets feature a series of mosaic panels made by arts group 'The Pioneers'.\nCulture.\nThe Three Choirs Festival, originating in the 18th century and one of the oldest music festivals in the British Isles, is held in Gloucester every third year, the other venues being Hereford and Worcester. Gloucester hosted the festival in 2019, and it is next due in the city in 2023.\nThe city's main theatre and cultural venue is the Guildhall. The Guildhall hosts a huge amount of entertainment, including live music, dance sessions, a cinema, bar, caf\u00e9, art gallery and much more. The Leisure Centre, GL1, hosts concerts and has a larger capacity than the Guildhall.\nThe annual Gloucester International Rhythm and Blues Festival takes place at the end of July and early August. Gloucester International Cajun and Zydeco Festival, the largest in the UK and longest-running in Europe, runs for a weekend in January each year. A Medieval Fayre is held in Westgate Street each year during the summer.\nGloucester is also noted as the home of the Frightmare Halloween Festival, the largest Halloween festival in the South West.\nThe main museum in the city is The Museum of Gloucester but there are several other important museums.\nThe Tailor of Gloucester House which is dedicated to the author Beatrix Potter can be found near the cathedral.\nSince 2013 Gloucester has marked Armed Forces Day with a Drum Head Service held on College Green in the shadow of the cathedral. This is followed by a parade of serving forces, veterans and cadets through the city centre to the docks for a family day with military and military-related charity displays and entertainment in Back Badge Square in front of the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum.\nNature in Art is a gallery dedicated to the display of works of art inspired by the natural world.\nThe city features in the popular, well-known nursery rhyme (of unknown date and origin) about a Doctor Foster, who reportedly visited the city, got wet, and swore to stay away as a result.\nChurches.\nGloucester has many churches, and historically has also had many dissenting chapels. It may have been the old proverb \"as sure as God's in Gloucester\" that provoked Oliver Cromwell to declare that the city had \"more churches than godliness\". Gloucester was the host of the first Sunday school in England; this was founded by Robert Raikes in 1780. Four of the churches that are of special interest are\nIn the neighbourhood around St Mary de Crypt there are slight remains of Greyfriars and Blackfriars monasteries, and also of the city wall. Under the Golden Fleece (The Monks Bar) and Saracen's Head inns early vaulted cellars still remains. In addition, in the city is St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, a Grade II* listed building.\nDuring the construction of the Boots store on the corner of Brunswick Road and Eastgate Street in 1974, Roman remains were found. These can be seen through a glass case on the street. At the back of the Gloucester Furniture Exhibition Centre part of the city's South Gate can be seen.\nEducation.\nThere are three endowed schools: the historic King's School, refounded by Henry VIII as part of the cathedral establishment; the school of St Mary de Crypt, now known as \"The Crypt School, Gloucester\" since it moved to a mile from town centre to Podsmead, founded by Dame Joan Cooke in the same reign (1539); Sir Thomas Rich's School, previously known as \"Sir Thomas Rich's Bluecoat Hospital for Boys\" (1666); the High School for Girls (1883); and Ribston Hall High School for Girls. Comprehensives include Henley Bank High School, Beaufort Co-operative Academy, St Peter's High School (Catholic school), Chosen Hill School, Severn Vale School, Gloucester Academy, Barnwood Park School and Churchdown School Academy. There is a Steiner Waldorf School founded in 1937 with a High School added just after the Second World War.\nThe city is home to one of three campuses of the University of Gloucestershire, based at Oxstalls, just outside the city centre. The university has also purchased the former Debenhams store in the city centre with a new campus due to open there in 2023. The university also manages student accommodation and halls of residence in the city, with the other campuses based in Cheltenham 7 miles away.\nTransport.\nRoads.\nThe M5 motorway, opened in 1971, runs east of the city boundary. Junction 12 serves south Gloucester and Quedgeley; junction 11a serves central Gloucester; and junction 11 serves north Gloucester. The A38 runs north\u2013south through Gloucester, connecting the city with Tewkesbury and Bristol. The A40 runs west to east, connecting Gloucester with Cheltenham to the east (via a dual carriageway section known as \"The Golden Valley Bypass\") and the Forest of Dean and South Wales to the West. The A46 and A4173 links Stroud, and the A417 links Cirencester in the south-east and Ledbury in the north-west. Gloucester has a network of cycle paths.\nUntil the construction of the Severn Bridge in 1966, Gloucester was the lowest road bridging point on the river and hence was an important settlement between South Wales and the southernmost counties of England including London. The Severn has a small anabranch here to reach Alney Island and then the main western bank. A bridge at Over, built by Thomas Telford in 1829, still stands, notable for its very flat arch, but its fragility and narrowness means it is disused; since 1974, it has been paralleled by a modern bridge. The Gloucester to Newport Line railway bridge is close to both, the lowest crossing of the UK's longest river until the Severn Railway Bridge 1879\u20131960, which was coupled with the Severn Tunnel in 1886, the present holder of that status.\nRailway.\nGloucester railway station is served by several train operating companies:\nGloucester was the site of the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company railway works, which have now closed. A new station at Hunts Grove has been considered on the southern edge of the city near Quedgeley, as part of \"MetroWest\" plans to extend Bristol commuter services to the city.\nBuses and coaches.\nMost local buses are run by Stagecoach West, centred at a depot on London Road, with connections to Cheltenham, Stroud, Ross-on-Wye and other smaller communities. For many years, there were both stopping and express services to Worcester and Birmingham operated by Midland Red and later Midland Red West, but this connection was lost due to service reductions. National Express Coaches operate the 444 route to London.\nCanals.\nGloucester is linked to the Severn Estuary by the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal, which is navigable by small coasters. The city is linked to the River Avon and Stourport-on-Severn by the navigable part of the River Severn, which is navigable by river craft of a few hundred tonnes' displacement. Gloucester Docks mark the Normal Tidal Limit (NTL) of the river. Gloucester was formerly linked to Ledbury and Hereford by the Herefordshire and Gloucestershire Canal; and subsequently by the Ledbury and Gloucester Railway, which used the southern section of the former canal, until it also closed in 1964. This canal is now being restored and the restored canal basin in the adjacent village of Over is a local attraction.\nAir.\nCommercial airports with scheduled services are Bristol, Birmingham and Cardiff 40\u201360 miles away; global hub Heathrow is about 100 miles by road and shares with Gloucester its main rail interchange at London Paddington.\nGloucestershire Airport, sited 8 miles east of the city, is a private and special charters airfield.\nBusiness and industry.\nGloucester has a long history in the aerospace business. In 1926 the Gloucestershire Aircraft Company at Brockworth changed its name to the Gloster Aircraft Company because international customers claimed that the name \"Gloucestershire\" was too difficult to spell. A sculpture in the city centre celebrates Gloucester's aviation history and its involvement in the jet engine. Frank Whittle's pioneering turbojet engine powered the Gloster E.28/39, the first British jet aircraft, which first flew at the company's airfield at Brockworth. This is commemorated by the pub \"The Whittle\" at Gloucester Business Park, which now occupies the site. Roads in the business park are named after other Gloster aircraft and a small statue overlooks the site of the old main runway. Messier-Dowty's landing gear plant and GE Aviation Dowty Propellers plants are on the outskirts of the city.\nThe large insurer Ecclesiastical Insurance is based in the city, as is its owner, the charity Benefact Trust. Lloyds Banking Group and TSB Bank each have an office in Barnwood, the former previously having been the headquarters of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society.\nGloucester was the home of Priday, Metford and Company Limited, a family milling firm which survived for over one hundred years, and hydraulic engineering firm Fielding &amp; Platt.\nGloucester Business Park is a business park on the outskirts on the city and is home to a number of big brands including Fortis and BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.\nUnilever Gloucester has made ice cream, such as the Cornetto (frozen dessert) and Viennetta, since 1962, in Barnwood. It has been the largest ice-cream factory in Europe.\nMedia.\n\"The Citizen\", published by Local World, is Gloucester's main newspaper, which shares all its content with the \"Gloucestershire Echo\" and the weekly \"Forester\" covering the Forest of Dean and Chepstow. As of 2018, these newspapers have all moved to weekly publication rather than daily.\nBBC Radio Gloucestershire has its studios on London Road in Gloucester. Heart West, previously Severn Sound, is based in Bristol. Gloucester FM is a community radio station specialising in black and urban music.\nLocal radio is broadcast from transmitters on Churchdown Hill (Chosen Hill).\nFor regional television in Gloucester is covered by BBC West Midlands &amp; BBC West on BBC One and ITV Central &amp; ITV West Country on ITV. Television signals are received from either Ridge Hill or Mendip TV transmitters.\nA number of TV and film productions have been filmed in Gloucester; most notably at the cathedral and docks. These include three of the Harry Potter films, \"Doctor Who\", \"Outlaw\" and \"Alice in Wonderland: Through the Looking Glass\".\nTwin towns \u2013 sister cities.\nGloucester is twinned with:\nGloucester was also twinned with Gouda in the Netherlands, but this twinning ended in 2015.\nNotable people.\nNotable residents of Gloucester have included:\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65372", "revid": "10059", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65372", "title": "One country, two systems", "text": "Chinese constitutional principle\n\"One country, two systems\" is a constitutional principle of the People's Republic of China (PRC) describing the governance of the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau.\nDeng Xiaoping developed the one country, two systems concept. This constitutional principle was formulated in the early 1980s during negotiations over Hong Kong between China and the United Kingdom. It provided that there would be only one China, but that each region would retain its own economic and administrative system. Under the principle, each of the two regions could continue to have its own governmental system, legal, economic and financial affairs, including trade relations with foreign countries, all of which are independent from those of the mainland. The PRC has also proposed to apply the principle in the unification it aims for with Taiwan.\nBackground.\nDeng Xiaoping developed the principle of one country, two systems in relation to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.176 Hong Kong and Macau had been colonised by European powers and Taiwan remained under Kuomintang Control at the end of the Chinese Civil War.176\nIn the context of Hong Kong.\nHong Kong was a colony of the United Kingdom, ruled by a governor appointed by the monarch of the United Kingdom, for 156 years from 1841 (except for four years of Japanese occupation during WWII) until 1997, when it was handed over to the Chinese government.\nIn discussing Hong Kong's future, Deng described the risk of possible instability which might be caused by what he termed as destructive forces both inside and outside Hong Kong.177 In Deng's view, these destructive forces might create instability both prior to, and as well as after, Hong Kong's return to China.177 Deng repeatedly stressed that the central government would need to intervene in Hong Kong affairs from time-to-time. Among other occasions, Deng told Hong Kong delegates to Beijing in 1984 that certain interventions would be necessary, that when turmoil occurs in Hong Kong the central government should intervene, and that it would be necessary to see if interventions would be in the interests of Hong Kongers and Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.178 In 1988, Deng stated that Hong Kong's political system was neither the British nor American systems and Hong Kong should not import Western political systems in the future.179\nPrior to Hong Kong's return to China, China and the UK signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, a treaty which stipulated the drafting and adoption of Hong Kong's organic law Basic Law before the handover. The Hong Kong Basic Law ensured that Hong Kong will be granted autonomy in regard to its capitalist economic system and own currency (the Hong Kong dollar), legal system, human rights, and legislative system as a special administrative region (SAR) of China for 50 years. The current arrangement has permitted Hong Kong to function as its own entity under the name \"Hong Kong, China\" in many international settings (e.g. the WTO and the Olympics).\nDuring the drafting of the Basic Law, Deng stated that universal suffrage and Western political systems were not appropriate for Hong Kong. Deng also stated that if Hong Kong became a base for anti-mainland China sentiment under the guise of democracy then China's central government should intervene.179\nThe Chinese renminbi is not legal tender in Hong Kong. Likewise, the Hong Kong dollar is not accepted in stores in mainland China. With this arrangement, a permit or special visa () is required when passing between the borders of Hong Kong and mainland China, and people in Hong Kong hold Hong Kong SAR passports rather than Chinese passports. The official languages are a major factor besides the history of the former colony that has made Hong Kong and mainland China distinct from each other, as Cantonese and English are the most widely used languages in Hong Kong, while Mandarin is the official language of mainland China. The central government in Beijing maintains control over Hong Kong's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law. The latter has led democracy advocates and some Hong Kong residents to argue that the territory has yet to achieve universal suffrage as promised by the Basic Law, leading to mass demonstrations in 2014.\nIn the context of Macau.\nA colony of Portugal for 442 years from 1557, Macau was returned to the Chinese government in 1999. In the Joint Declaration on the Question of Macau, the drafting and adoption of Macau's organic law before its return was foreseen. Like Hong Kong, a basic law would ensure that Macau retained its economic system, currency (the Macanese pataca), legal system (which is based on Portuguese civil law), legislative system, and people's rights for 50 years, as a special administrative region (SAR) of China. The agreement has permitted Macau to function as its own entity in many international settings (e.g. WTO) rather than as a part of China.\nAs Macau has its own currency, the Chinese renminbi is not legal tender in Macau; the pataca is also not accepted in stores in China. With this agreement, a permit or visa is required when crossing between the borders of Macau and China, and people in Macau generally hold Macau SAR passports rather than mainland Chinese passports. Like Hong Kong, the official languages are a major factor that has made Macau and China distinct from each other besides the history of the former colony, as Cantonese and Portuguese are the official languages in Macau, while Mandarin is the official language of China. The central government in Beijing also maintains control over Macau's foreign affairs as well as the legal interpretation of the Basic Law.\nIn the context of Taiwan.\nIn addition to the Hong Kong and Macau contexts, Deng proposed the principle's applicability to Chinese unification,176 but the government of Taiwan has consistently rejected the proposal as recently as December 2023[ [update]]. According to polls conducted by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council in 2025, over 80 percent of Taiwan reject \"one country, two systems\".\nApplication to Hong Kong and Macau.\nChinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping proposed the principle during negotiation with British prime minister Margaret Thatcher over the expiration of the United Kingdom's lease on the New Territories (including New Kowloon) of Hong Kong in 1997. The same principle was proposed in talks with Portugal about Macau.\nThe principle is that, upon reunification, despite the practice of socialism in mainland China, both Hong Kong and Macau, which were colonies of the United Kingdom and Portugal respectively, could retain their established system under a high degree of autonomy for up to 50 years after reunification. However, what would happen after 2047 and 2049 for Hong Kong and Macau respectively has never been publicly stated.\nChapter 1, Article 5 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, the constitutional document of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, reads:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The socialist system and policies shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years.\nThe establishment of these regions, called \"special administrative regions\" (SARs), is authorised by Article 31 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which states that the state may establish SARs when necessary, and that the systems to be instituted in them shall be prescribed by law enacted by the National People's Congress in light of the specific conditions.\nThe SARs of Hong Kong and Macau were formally established on the 1 July 1997 and the 20 December 1999 respectively, immediately after the People's Republic of China (PRC) assumed sovereignty over these respective regions.\nFramework.\nThe two SARs of Hong Kong and Macau are responsible for their domestic affairs including, but not limited to, the judiciary and courts of final appeal, immigration and customs, public finance, currencies and extradition. The SARs are also exempt from mainland laws mandating the use of simplified characters in publishing and Mandarin in public education and most broadcasting. The diplomatic relations and military defence of the two SARs however, is the responsibility of the Central People's Government in Beijing.\nHong Kong continues using English common law while Macau continues using the Portuguese civil law system.\nNames.\nWhen the two regions have their own membership in international organisations (such as the WTO and the Paralympics), both regions are mandated to use the name \"Hong Kong, China\" or \"Macao, China\" instead of \"Hong Kong\" or \"Macau\"/\"Macao\", as stipulated several times under Chapter VII (\"External Affairs\") of both regions' Basic Laws.\nFor example, in Trade Policy Review documents between Hong Kong and the WTO, the documents use \"Hong Kong, China\" throughout even in prose. When a short name is used, it uses the acronym \"HKC\" and never \"Hong Kong\" or \"HK\" standalone. Similarly, in Trade Policy Review documents between Macau and the WTO, \"Macao, China\" is used in prose throughout and the only short name used is the acronym \"MSAR\".\nPotential extension.\nSeveral high level members of the government have expressed a potential extension of the system beyond 2047 for Hong Kong. In January 2020, Carrie Lam stated that \"My view is this: as long as we persist with the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle, push forward the implementation of 'One Country, Two Systems' and have a full understanding and implementation of the principle... then we have adequate reason to believe that 'One Country, Two Systems' will be implemented smoothly and in the long term, and it will not change after 2047.\"\nAdditionally, in a June 2020 online webinar to campaign for the National Security Law, Zhang Xiaoming said that the National Security Law would ensure that the freedoms granted to the city can be extended beyond 2047. However, neither Carrie Lam or Zhang Xiaoming have promised such an extension or laid out concrete steps or goals in order for it to happen.\nIn October 2021, Carrie Lam reiterated that she believed the system would be extended beyond 2047, stating \"Anybody would seriously ask: why do we have to change it? But of course, something more concrete will have to come out later on to give the needed assurance about the continuation of the common law system, the monetary system, the professional recognition system, maybe some land leases.\"\nIn March 2022, Xia Baolong, head of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said that after 2047, the \"one country, two systems\" could be extended by another 50 years, until 2097. In July 2022, Leung Chun-ying, former chief executive, said that he expected the system to be extended past 2047. On 1 July 2022, during a visit to Hong Kong, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping made a promise that the system is a long-term policy. In February 2024, Xia Baolong said that the system would be kept permanently.\nImplementation in Hong Kong.\nDegree of autonomy.\nAs a British colony, Hong Kong was neither democratic nor autonomous.177 After Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing promised that Hong Kong citizens would be free to elect their local government. However, the Basic Law does not have a clear timetable for when universal suffrage is to be achieved, ultimately stating that a full vote by the populace and universal suffrage must be reached before the end of the 50-year transition according to Article 45.\nIn the year after the handover, surveys showed high levels of satisfaction with Beijing's hands-off relationship with the former colony.\nThe year before, the Provisional Legislative Council passed laws restricting the right of abode, leading to a case brought against the government, which ended in a loss for the government in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in 1999. The government then took its case to the National People's Congress. The legal establishment expressed its disapproval of the act Martin Lee described as \"giving away\" Hong Kong's autonomy with a silent march. Polls showed the events had depressed the public's confidence in the government, despite the fact that most were in favour of the government's stance over that of the court's.\nOn 10 June 2014, China's central government released a white paper describing its view of comprehensive jurisdiction over Hong Kong.180 The white paper stated that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy is not an inherent power, but rather one which exists solely through the authorization of the central government.180 The white paper's release ignited criticism from many people in Hong Kong, who said that the Communist leadership was reneging on its pledges to abide by the \"one country, two systems\" policy that allows for a democratic, autonomous Hong Kong under Beijing's rule.\nDuring the 2014 Hong Kong protests, students demanded more political freedom in direct response to the \"831 decision\" of the NPCSC. The participants demanded freedom of choice, electoral freedom, democracy and, in particular, they wanted to participate in the elections of the head of the administration of Hong Kong. The name \"umbrella movement\" originated because the students protected themselves with umbrellas from the pepper spray of the police. Thus, umbrellas became the symbol of this movement. In 2016, Joshua Wong, Alex Chow and Nathan Law, student leaders of the protests, were charged for their roles in the protests and found guilty. https://\nMoral and National Education controversy.\nIt was officially announced in September 2012 that the Hong Kong government would introduce compulsory \"national, moral and civic education\" in all non-international primary and secondary schools to strengthen \"national identity awareness and nurture patriotism towards China\". According to an academic research paper, the current school curriculum in Hong Kong projects a \"dual sense of identity\": \"Chineseness\" and \"Hongkongesness\" and notably, this has created strong public activism by Hong Kong pre- and post-1997. However, the new curriculum includes \"general civic education\" and lessons meant to increase students' appreciation of China. This announcement led to 10 days of protests, with up to 120,000 protesters each day, due to concerns of Hong Kong losing autonomy. In response, the chief executive at the time, CY Leung, chose to remove the idea of compulsory teaching, meaning that schools could freely decide if they would teach the subject. Despite CY Leung's decision, new chief executive Carrie Lam, who took over on 1 July 2017, has prioritised the topic of national education, by placing importance on \"instilling patriotism in pupils\". Furthermore, in August 2017, Christine Choi Yuk-Lin was appointed by the government as the under-secretary of the Education Bureau. She \"has former connections with the pro-Beijing Federation of Education Workers\" (SCMP article A). This led to more than 17,000 people signing a petition opposing Yuk-lin having the position. Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping also announced during his visit to Hong Kong in July 2017 the need for an enhancement and boost of \"national history and culture\" in Hong Kong education.\nCauseway Bay booksellers case.\nThe disappearances of five staff at Causeway Bay Books \u2013 an independent publisher and bookstore \u2013 in October to December 2015 precipitated an international outcry as cross-border abductions were widely suspected. Although at least two of them disappeared in mainland China, one in Thailand, one member was last seen in Hong Kong, but apparently had found his way across the Chinese land border in Shenzhen without the necessary travel documents. The unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the suspected abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, in violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. It was later confirmed that they are under detention in mainland China although most had reappeared in Hong Kong and cancelled their missing persons' reports with the police.\nOn 16 June 2016, shortly after he returned to Hong Kong, Lam Wing-kee gave a long press conference in which he detailed the circumstances surrounding his eight-month detention, and describing how his confession and those of his associates had been scripted and stage-managed. Lam implicated the involvement of the Central Investigation Team, which is under direct control of the highest level of the Beijing leadership. His revelations stunned Hong Kong and made headlines worldwide, prompting a flurry of counter-accusations and denials from mainland authorities and supporters.\nHong Kong National Party ban.\nOn 17 July 2018, the Hong Kong Police Force served the party convener a notice under the Societies Ordinance, seeking to ban the Hong Kong National Party (HKNP) for sedition, on grounds of national security with respect to Chinese territorial integrity. The party and its convener Andy Chan submitted their case against being outlawed. Ten days later, in an unprecedented move, Secretary for Security John Lee on 24 September 2018 officially banned the party on national security grounds.\nThe ban prohibited anyone who claims to be a HKNP member, or is found to provide aid to the party in any way, under the threat of being fined and jailed for up to two years. The definition of \"providing aid\" to the party and the two leaders were not made clear. Chan's lawyers wrote to the Department of Justice seeking an assurance that providing legal assistance to him would not be regarded as providing assistance to the HKNP, but that assurance was not forthcoming.\nVictor Mallet controversy.\nIn August, a controversy erupted in 2018 when the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Hong Kong (FCC) hosted a lunchtime talk with Andy Chan, convener of the Hong Kong Independence Party (HKIP) to take place on 14 August. Victor Mallet, vice-chairman of the press organisation, chaired the session. The governments of China and Hong Kong had called for the cancellation of the talk, because the issue of independence supposedly crossed one of the \"bottom lines\" on national sovereignty. After a visit to Bangkok, Mallet was denied a working visa by the Hong Kong government. Mallet was subjected to a four-hour interrogation by immigration officers on his return from Thailand on Sunday 7 October before he was finally allowed to enter Hong Kong on a seven-day tourist visa.\nIn the absence of an official explanation, Mallet's visa rejection was widely seen to be retribution for his role in chairing the Andy Chan talk which the FCC refused to call off. Secretary for Security John Lee insisted the ban on Mallet was unrelated to press freedom, but declined to explain the decision. The incident caused a furious debate over restrictions to freedoms that were supposedly protected by the Sino-British Joint Declaration under \"one country, two systems\".\nExtradition bill and Hong Kong 2019\u20132020 protests.\nIn April 2019, an extradition bill was proposed in Hong Kong inciting mass protests. The new law identifies that those who are suspects of serious crimes could be sent to China. This was initiated due to a murder suspect fleeing from Taiwan to Hong Kong in 2018. He was accused of murdering his pregnant 20 year old girlfriend, thus Hong Kong authorities were asked by Taiwan to extradite the man. Hong Kong, however, did not concur with this demand and could not prosecute him as Hong Kong does not have any form of an extradition agreement with Taiwan. In terms of the Extradition Law, it was claimed that decisions would be made on a \"case-by-case basis by the Chief Executive\", in addition to Hong Kong courts making final decisions on extradition requests. For this reason, those accused of crimes based on politics or religion would not be extradited, and the new law would purely be \"dealing with cross border crimes and transnational crimes\" that carries a minimum seven-years sentence, as Carrie Lam stated in her speech on Monday 10 June. However, many Hong Kong people claim that this is another example of Hong Kong losing its autonomy. There has been criticism that this law would mean that suspects would be susceptible to many practices under the Chinese judicial system that is not present in the Hong Kong judicial system: arbitrary detention, unfair trial and torture. Michael DeGolyer, a researcher at Baptist University of Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera that Hong Kong people fear lack of judicial independence as the current judiciary system \"is seen as guaranteeing a measure of protection from the government on the mainland\".\nThere has been a widespread response opposing the law: nationally and internationally. Criticism, petitions and protests have incorporated many parts of society, including doctors, lawyers, teachers and housewives. On 9 June there were an estimated one million people protesting across Hong Kong, making it the biggest protest since the handover. Additionally, concern was displayed internationally: in Britain, Canada, the European Union and the United States. The US congressional commission argued in May 2019 that the extradition bill makes \"Hong Kong more susceptible to China's political coercion and further erodes Hong Kong's autonomy\". China's foreign ministry has rebutted these concerns by claiming them \"attempts to politicise the Hong Kong government proposal and interference in China's internal affairs\".\nDue to this negative response nationally and internationally, on 4 September 2019, Carrie Lam formally announced that the extradition bill would be withdrawn. Despite this, fear of the loss of Hong Kong autonomy remains. Protests continued until the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in January 2020 and were further halted by the passing of the National People's Congress decision on Hong Kong national security legislation.\n2020 national security legislation.\nA draft national security bill was submitted on 22 May 2020 to China's national parliament, the National People's Congress. In accordance with the one country, two systems formula, Hong Kong's basic law requires the Hong Kong legislature to ratify national security to prevent sedition, secession and foreign interference. The Chinese central government is now bypassing the HKSAR to directly legislate. A National People's Congress official reported as saying it was exercising \"constitutional power\" to create a new legal framework and enforcement mechanism to guarantee national security in Hong Kong. On 30 June 2020, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) passed the national security law for Hong Kong unanimously and listed it under Annex III of the Basic Law, bypassing Hong Kong approval. The Hong Kong Bar Association (HKBA) disputed the constitutionality of enacting the law through inclusion in Annex III of the Basic Law in May 2020.\nOn 30 May 2020, the president of the United States, Donald J. Trump, in a White House press conference, officially declared that the United States would be ending special treatments afforded to Hong Kong as outlined in the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act, due to China replacing the promised formula of \"one country, two systems\" with \"one country, one system\", and threatened that the United States would take further actions on Hong Kong in response to the national security law. On 14 July 2020, President Trump signed Executive Order 13936, pursuant to the Hong Kong Autonomy Act passed by the US Congress, ending Hong Kong's special trade privileges.\nAccording to Victoria Tin-bor Hui, writing in \"The Diplomat\", the national security legislation is being used to erode civil and legal protections on the way to \"establishing a police state\" in Hong Kong.\nImplementation in Macau.\nMacau and mainland China relations.\nMacau has not seen outbreaks of protests and civil unrest that have occurred in Hong Kong. According to Jason Chao, a former president of the New Macau Association (a pro-democracy party), Macau differed from Hong Kong as Macau does not wish for freedom and autonomy. Instead, the majority of Macau's population are pro-China. A reason for this is because approximately half of the 600,000 people living in Macau are Chinese immigrants. In December 2019, Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPCSC, claimed that there is a \"strong sense of international identity\" in Macau. In Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping's first official speech in Macau in December 2019 marking the 20th anniversary, he proclaimed Macau as \"a gorgeous chapter in the short history of the one country, two systems experiment\". Chief executive of Macau, Ho Iat Seng, said: \"Macau will be an example of China's reunification,\" and Xi has agreed, by placing emphasis on the \"Macau Model\" as Macau has correctly followed the \"one country, two system\" agreement. As a reward for Macau's peaceful behaviour and lack of anti-government protests, Xi Jinping has given Macau more Chinese land from Hengqin Island. This is to enable Macau to further develop their education and healthcare system, in addition to physically integrating Macau more with China. Under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" policy, Macau has an independent legal and financial system, allowing the legal development of the gambling industry and opening up to the international market, which has led to its rapid rise as a global gambling hub and significant economic growth and international influence.\nProposed application onto Taiwan.\nIt has been claimed that the system was originally designed for Taiwan in order for it to be unified with the PRC; the PRC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs further claims that Mao Zedong originated the idea of one country, two systems for Taiwan in May 1960. Since then, the PRC government has repeatedly proposed the application of the one country, two systems principle for Taiwan.\nThe ROC government continues to refuse the suggestion of one country, two systems; the ROC's Mainland Affairs Council cited 218 cases between 1997 and 2017 that they claim to be breaches of the principle in Hong Kong. Of the nationally or locally represented political parties in Taiwan, only the right-wing to far-right New Party (which published its own proposal in August 2019) and left-wing Labor Party who both only have 1 council member in the country, support unification under one country, two systems. While the current main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT) is generally seen as pro-unification, it rejects unification under one country, two systems.\nA new policy based on the 1992 Consensus was emphasised during the Pan-Blue visits to mainland China in April 2005 as well as subsequent major cross-strait exchanges under President Ma Ying-jeou, whose pro-unification KMT won the 2008 Taiwanese presidential election.\nPost-2019 developments.\nIn January 2019, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced an open letter to Taiwan proposing development of a one country, two systems formula unique to Taiwan, which he called the \"Two Systems\" Taiwan Plan (), for eventual unification. President Tsai Ing-wen responded to Xi in a January 2019 speech by stating that Taiwan rejected one country, two systems, and that because Beijing equated the 1992 Consensus with one country, two systems, Taiwan rejected it as well. Tsai expressed her solidarity with Hong Kong protesters, remarking that Taiwan's democracy was hard-earned and had to be guarded and renewed. Pledging that as long as she was Taiwan's president, she would never accept one country, two systems, Tsai cited what she considered to be the constant and rapid deterioration of democracy in Hong Kong over the previous 20 years.\nFollowing the landslide defeat of the KMT in the 2020 Taiwanese presidential election, KMT chairman Johnny Chiang rejected the one country, two systems as a feasible model for Taiwan. In 2021, the KMT platform under newly elected chairman Eric Chu also continued to include the 1992 Consensus while rejecting one country, two systems.\nThe German Marshall Fund observed in 2024 that Xi's 2019 instruction for PRC researchers to develop a unique \"Two Systems\" Taiwan Plan was a tacit admission that the principle as applied to Hong Kong and Macau was ill-suited to Taiwan's situation. As of 2024, a detailed framework of the \"Two Systems\" Taiwan Plan has not been announced.\nA May 2025 white paper published by the PRC's State Council Information Office outlining their official positions on national sovereignty, \"China's National Security in the New Era\", proclaimed that \"Taiwan is a province of China\" while also calling for implementation of the PRC's \"Comprehensive Plan for Resolving the Taiwan Problem in the New Era\", which calls for the PRC to adhere to the one country, two systems principle during cross-strait talks with Taiwanese political parties to resolve the \"unresolved nature of China's civil war\".\nAlternative proposals.\nIn 1987, then-president of the Republic of China Chiang Ching-kuo counter-proposed with the alternative of \"\" () in a pun on \"one country, two systems\" (), proposing that the PRC and ROC could be unified after the PRC adopts the democratic system of the ROC.\nDuring his visit to Beijing in March 2012, former KMT Chairman Wu Po-hsiung proposed a \"one country, two areas\" () framework to govern cross-strait relations, though this term did not become widely adopted.\nComparison to status of Tibet.\nJiang (2008) notes that the concept of \"one country, two systems\" is based on the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet signed in 1951, and that its mechanism is similar to how the Qing emperor integrated new territories it had conquered by permitting local elites in these regions to continue to enjoy power for a time and to exercise autonomy without apparently threatening distinct local customs. As the concept was merely a \"tactical and transitional arrangement\", a point of view argues that the territory of Hong Kong will gradually experience the same fate as Tibet since 1959 \u2013 forced assimilation and tight direct control by the central government. Over time, full assimilation, and abolition of local autonomy, would take place in a manner \"illustrative of a similar Chinese imperial expansionist mentalit\u00e9\".\nThe 14th Dalai Lama's 2005 proposal for \"high-level autonomy\" for Tibet, evolved from a position of advocating Tibetan independence, has been compared to \"one country, two systems\". He has said that his proposals should be acceptable to China because \"one country, two systems\" is accommodated for in the Chinese Constitution. State media rejected this claim, pointing out that \"one country, two systems\" was designed for the capitalist social systems of Hong Kong and Macau, which had never existed in Tibet. In 2012, Dalai Lama mentioned again that the Seventeen Point Agreement was signed in the spirit of \"one country, two systems\".\nOne country, two systems proposals for other countries.\nMuhammad Cohen, writing for \"Asia Times\", suggests the \"one country, two systems\" formula is a possible solution to the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.\nNorth Korea suggests the \"one country, two systems\" formula to bring about Korean reunification, through a confederation of two systems within one country. China has also promoted the idea; the difference between North Korea's motivation and China's is that North Korea seeks to maintain two separate governments, while China seeks gradual unification as it wishes to bring stability to the Korean peninsula with one centralised government.\nIrish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said the arrangement linking Hong Kong with China could be a possible solution for addressing the fate of Northern Ireland after Brexit. The border between the EU member state Republic of Ireland and British-ruled Northern Ireland is becoming an increasing concern in talks with the United Kingdom, with Dublin demanding that the frontier remain completely open, to avoid endangering the peace process.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term is taken from the medieval Mediterranean Lingua Franca, a Romance-based pidgin language used especially by traders in the Mediterranean Basin from the 11th to the 19th centuries. A world language\u2014a language spoken internationally and by many people\u2014is a language that may function as a global lingua franca.\nCharacteristics.\nAny language regularly used for communication between people who do not share a native language is a lingua franca. Lingua franca is a functional term, independent of any linguistic history or language structure.\nPidgins are therefore lingua francas; creoles and arguably mixed languages may similarly be used for communication between language groups. But lingua franca is equally applicable to a non-creole language native to one nation (often a colonial power) learned as a second language and used for communication between diverse language communities in a colony or former colony.\nLingua francas are often pre-existing languages with native speakers, but they can also be pidgins or creoles developed for that specific region or context. Pidgins are rapidly developed and simplified combinations of two or more established languages, while creoles are generally viewed as pidgins that have evolved into fully complex languages in the course of adaptation by subsequent generations. Pre-existing lingua francas such as French are used to facilitate intercommunication in large-scale trade or political matters, while pidgins and creoles often arise out of colonial situations and a specific need for communication between colonists and indigenous peoples.\u00a0Pre-existing lingua francas are generally widespread, highly developed languages with many native speakers. Conversely, pidgins are very simplified means of communication, containing loose structuring, few grammatical rules, and possessing few or no native speakers. Creole languages are more developed than their ancestral pidgins, utilizing more complex structure, grammar, and vocabulary, as well as having substantial communities of native speakers.\nWhereas a vernacular language is the native language of a specific geographical community, a lingua franca is used beyond the boundaries of its original community, for trade, religious, political, or academic reasons. For example, English is a vernacular in the United Kingdom but it is used as a lingua franca in the Philippines, alongside Filipino. Likewise, Arabic, French, Standard Chinese, Russian and Spanish serve similar purposes as industrial and educational lingua francas across regional and national boundaries.\nEven though they are used as bridge languages, international auxiliary languages such as Esperanto have not had a great degree of adoption, so they are not described as lingua francas.\nEtymology.\nThe term \"lingua franca\" derives from Mediterranean Lingua Franca (also known as \"Sabir\"), the pidgin language that people around the Levant and the eastern Mediterranean Sea used as the main language of commerce and diplomacy from the late Middle Ages to the 18th century, most notably during the Renaissance era. During that period, a simplified version of mainly Italian in the eastern Mediterranean and Spanish in the western Mediterranean that incorporated many loanwords from Greek, Slavic languages, Arabic, and Turkish came to be widely used as the \"lingua franca\" of the region, although some scholars claim that the Mediterranean Lingua Franca was just poorly used Italian.\nIn Lingua Franca (the specific language), is from the Italian for 'a language'. is related to Greek () and Arabic () as well as the equivalent Italian\u2014in all three cases, the literal sense is 'Frankish', leading to the direct translation: 'language of the Franks'. During the late Byzantine Empire, \"Franks\" was a term that applied to all Western Europeans.\nThrough changes of the term in literature, \"lingua franca\" has come to be interpreted as a general term for pidgins, creoles, and some or all forms of vehicular languages. This transition in meaning has been attributed to the idea that pidgin languages only became widely known from the 16th century on due to European colonization of continents such as The Americas, Africa, and Asia. During this time, the need for a term to address these pidgin languages arose, hence the shift in the meaning of Lingua Franca from a single proper noun to a common noun encompassing a large class of pidgin languages.\nAs recently as the late 20th century, some restricted the use of the generic term to mean only mixed languages that are used as vehicular languages, its original meaning.\nDouglas Harper's \"Online Etymology Dictionary\" states that the term \"Lingua Franca\" (as the name of the particular language) was first recorded in English during the 1670s, although an even earlier example of the use of it in English is attested from 1632, where it is also referred to as \"Bastard Spanish\".\nUsage notes.\nThe term is well established in its naturalization to English and so major dictionaries do not italicize it as a \"foreign\" term.\nIts plurals in English are \"lingua francas\" and \"linguae francae\", with the former being first-listed or only-listed in major dictionaries, while the latter is rarely used.\nExamples.\nHistorical lingua francas.\nThe use of lingua francas has existed since antiquity.\nAkkadian remained the common language of a large part of Western Asia from several earlier empires, until it was supplanted in this role by Aramaic.\nSanskrit historically served as a lingua franca throughout the majority of South Asia. The Sanskrit language's historic presence is attested across a wide geography beyond South Asia. Inscriptions and literary evidence suggest that Sanskrit was already being adopted in Southeast Asia and Central Asia in the 1st millennium CE, through monks, religious pilgrims and merchants.\nUntil the early 20th century, Literary Chinese served as both the written lingua franca and the diplomatic language in East Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, Ry\u016bky\u016b, and Vietnam. In the early 20th century, vernacular written Chinese replaced Classical Chinese within China as both the written and spoken lingua franca for speakers of different Chinese dialects, and because of the declining power and cultural influence of China in East Asia, English has since replaced Classical Chinese as the lingua franca in East Asia.\nKoine Greek was the lingua franca of the Hellenistic culture. Koine Greek (Modern ; ), also known as Alexandrian dialect, common Attic, Hellenistic, or Biblical Greek, was the common supra-regional form of Greek spoken and written during the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire and the early Byzantine Empire. It evolved from the spread of Greek following the conquests of Alexander the Great in the fourth century BC, and served as the lingua franca of much of the Mediterranean region and the Middle East during the following centuries.\nLatin, through the power of the Roman Republic, became the dominant language in Italy and subsequently throughout the realms of the Roman Empire. Even after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, Latin was the common language of communication, science, and academia in Europe until well into the 18th century, when other regional vernaculars (including its own descendants, the Romance languages) supplanted it in common academic and political usage, and it eventually became a dead language in the modern linguistic definition.\nOld Tamil was once the lingua franca for most of ancient Tamilakam and Sri Lanka. John Guy states that Tamil was also the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India. The language and its dialects were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century CE.\nClassical M\u0101ori is the retrospective name for the language (formed out of many dialects, albeit all mutually intelligible) of both the North Island and the South Island for the 800 years before the European settlement of New Zealand. M\u0101ori shared a common language that was used for trade, inter-iwi dialogue on marae, and education through w\u0101nanga. After the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, M\u0101ori language was the lingua franca of the Colony of New Zealand until English superseded it in the 1870s. The description of M\u0101ori language as New Zealand's 19th-century lingua franca has been widely accepted. The language was initially vital for all European and Chinese migrants in New Zealand to learn, as M\u0101ori formed a majority of the population, owned nearly all the country's land and dominated the economy until the 1860s. Discriminatory laws such as the Native Schools Act 1867 contributed to the demise of M\u0101ori language as a lingua franca. In earlier contact eras, M\u0101ori was also among the bases for Maritime Polynesian Pidgin for use between European voyagers and trading Polynesians as a whole.\nSogdian was used to facilitate trade between those who spoke different languages along the Silk Road, which is why native speakers of Sogdian were employed as translators in Tang China. The Sogdians also ended up circulating spiritual beliefs and texts, including those of Buddhism and Christianity, thanks to their ability to communicate to many people in the region through their native language.\nOld Church Slavonic, an Eastern South Slavic language, is the first Slavic literary language. Between 9th and 11th century, it was the lingua franca of a great part of the predominantly Slavic states and populations in Southeast and Eastern Europe, in liturgy and church organization, culture, literature, education and diplomacy, as an Official language and National language in the case of Bulgaria. It was the first national and also international Slavic literary language (autonym , ). The Glagolitic alphabet was originally used at both schools, though the Cyrillic script was developed early on at the Preslav Literary School, where it superseded Glagolitic as the official script in Bulgaria in 893. Old Church Slavonic spread to other South-Eastern, Central, and Eastern European Slavic territories, most notably Croatia, Serbia, Bohemia, Lesser Poland, and principalities of the Kievan Rus' while retaining characteristically South Slavic linguistic features. It spread also to not completely Slavic territories between the Carpathian Mountains, the Danube and the Black Sea, corresponding to Wallachia and Moldavia. Nowadays, the Cyrillic writing system is used for various languages across Eurasia, and as the national script in various Slavic, Turkic, Mongolic, Uralic, Caucasian and Iranic-speaking countries in Southeastern Europe, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, Central, North, and East Asia.\nPolish language was a lingua franca, important both diplomatically and academically in Central and part of Eastern Europe. Tomasz Kamusella notes that \"Polish is the oldest, non-ecclesiastical, written Slavic language with a continuous tradition of literacy and official use, which has lasted unbroken from the 16th century to this day.\" Polish evolved into the main sociolect of the nobles in Poland\u2013Lithuania in the 15th century. The history of Polish as a language of state governance begins in the 16th century in the Kingdom of Poland. Over the later centuries, Polish served as the official language in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Congress Poland, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, and as the administrative language in the Russian Empire's Western Krai. The growth of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's influence gave Polish the status of \"lingua franca\" in Central and Eastern Europe.\nThe Mediterranean Lingua Franca was largely based on Italian and Proven\u00e7al. This language was spoken from the 11th to 19th centuries around the Mediterranean basin, particularly in the European commercial empires of Italian cities (Genoa, Venice, Florence, Milan, Pisa, Siena) and in trading ports located throughout the eastern Mediterranean rim.\nDuring the Renaissance, standard Italian was spoken as a language of culture in the main royal courts of Europe, and among intellectuals. This lasted from the 14th century to the end of the 16th, when French replaced Italian as the usual lingua franca in northern Europe. Italian musical terms, in particular dynamic and tempo notations, have continued in use to the present day.\nLow German, also known as Low Saxon, used to be the Lingua franca during the late Hohenstaufen till the mid-15th century periods (Middle Low German), in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea when extensive trading was done by the Hanseatic League along the Baltic and North Seas.\nClassical Quechua is either of two historical forms of Quechua, the exact relationship and degree of closeness between which is controversial, and which have sometimes been identified with each other. These are:\nAjem-Turkic functioned as lingua franca in the Caucasus region and in southeastern Dagestan, and was widely spoken at the court and in the army of Safavid Iran.\nModern.\nEnglish.\nEnglish is sometimes described as the foremost global lingua franca, being used as a working language by individuals of diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds in a variety of fields and international organizations to communicate with one another. English is the most spoken language in the world, primarily due to the historical global influence of the British Empire as well as the United States. It is a co-official language of the United Nations and many other international and regional organizations and has also become the \"de facto\" language of diplomacy, science, international trade, tourism, aviation, entertainment and the Internet.\nWhen the United Kingdom became a colonial power, English served as the lingua franca of the colonies of the British Empire. In the post-colonial period, most of the newly independent nations which had many indigenous languages opted to continue using English as one of their official languages such as Ghana and South Africa. In other former colonies with several official languages such as Singapore and Fiji, English is the primary medium of education and serves as the lingua franca among citizens.\nEven in countries not associated with the English-speaking world, English has emerged as a lingua franca in certain situations where its use is perceived to be more efficient to communicate, especially among groups consisting of native speakers of many languages. In Qatar, the medical community is primarily made up of workers from countries without English as a native language. In medical practices and hospitals, nurses typically communicate with other professionals in English as a lingua franca. This occurrence has led to interest in researching the consequences of the medical community communicating in a lingua franca. English is also sometimes used in Switzerland between people who do not share one of Switzerland's four official languages, or with foreigners who are not fluent in the local language. In the European Union, the use of English as a lingua franca has led researchers to investigate whether a Euro English dialect has emerged. In the fields of technology and science, English emerged as a lingua franca in the 20th century. English has also significantly influenced many other languages.\nSpanish.\nThe Spanish language spread mainly throughout the New World, becoming a lingua franca in the territories and colonies of the Spanish Empire, which also included parts of Africa, Asia, and Oceania. After the breakup of much of the empire in the Americas, its function as a lingua franca was solidified by the governments of the newly independent nations of what is now Hispanic America. While its usage in Spain's Asia-Pacific colonies has largely died out except in the Philippines, where it is still spoken by a small minority, Spanish became the lingua franca of what is now Equatorial Guinea, being the main language of government and education and is spoken by the vast majority of the population.\nDue to large numbers of immigrants from Latin America in the second half of the 20th century and resulting influence, Spanish has also emerged somewhat as a lingua franca in parts of the Southwestern United States and southern Florida, especially in communities where native Spanish speakers form the majority of the population.\nAt present it is the second most used language in international trade, and the third most used in politics, diplomacy and culture after English and French.\nIt is also one of the most taught foreign languages throughout the world and is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\nFrench.\nFrench is sometimes regarded as the first global lingua franca, having supplanted Latin as the prestige language of politics, trade, education, diplomacy, and military in early modern Europe and later spreading around the world with the establishment of the French colonial empire. With France emerging as the leading political, economic, and cultural power of Europe in the 16th century, the language was adopted by royal courts throughout the continent, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Russia, and as the language of communication between European academics, merchants, and diplomats. With the expansion of Western colonial empires, French became the main language of diplomacy and international relations up until World War II when it was replaced by English due the rise of the United States as the leading superpower. Stanley Meisler of the \"Los Angeles Times\" said that the fact that the Treaty of Versailles was written in English as well as French was the \"first diplomatic blow\" against the language. Nevertheless, it remains the second most used language in international affairs and is one of the six official languages of the United Nations.\nAs a legacy of French and Belgian colonial rule, most former colonies of these countries maintain French as an official language or lingua franca due to the many indigenous languages spoken in their territory. Notably, in most Francophone West and Central African countries, French has transitioned from being only a lingua franca to the native language among some communities, mostly in urban areas or among the elite class. In other regions such as the French-speaking countries of the Maghreb (Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, and Mauritania) and parts of the French Caribbean, French is the lingua franca in professional sectors and education, even though it is not the native language of the majority.\nFrench continues to be used as a lingua franca in certain cultural fields such as cuisine, fashion, and sport.\nAs a consequence of Brexit, French has been increasingly used as a lingua franca in the European Union and its institutions either alongside or, at times, in place of English.\nChinese.\nToday, Standard Mandarin Chinese is the lingua franca of China and Taiwan, which are home to many mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese and, in the case of Taiwan, indigenous Formosan languages. Among many Chinese diaspora communities, Cantonese is often used as the lingua franca instead, particularly in Southeast Asia, due to a longer history of immigration and trade networks with southern China, although Mandarin has also been adopted in some circles since the 2000s.\nArabic.\nArabic was used as a lingua franca across the Islamic empires, whose sizes necessitated a common language, and spread across the Arab and Muslim worlds. In Djibouti and parts of Eritrea, both of which are countries where multiple official languages are spoken, Arabic has emerged as a lingua franca in part thanks to the population of the region being predominantly Muslim and Arabic playing a crucial role in Islam. In addition, after having fled from Eritrea due to ongoing warfare and gone to some of the nearby Arab countries, Eritrean emigrants are contributing to Arabic becoming a lingua franca in the region by coming back to their homelands having picked up the Arabic language.\nRussian.\nRussian is in use and widely understood in Central Asia and the Caucasus, areas formerly part of the Russian Empire and Soviet Union. Its use remains prevalent in many post-Soviet states. Russian has some presence as a minority language in the Baltic states and some other states in Eastern Europe, as well as in pre-opening China. It remains the official language of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russian is also one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, its use has declined in post-Soviet states. Parts of the Russian speaking minorities outside Russia have either emigrated to Russia or assimilated into their countries of residence by learning the local language, which they now prefer to use in daily communication.\nFor contrast, in Central European countries that after the Second World War were included in the Soviet Union's sphere of influence, the Russian language was used only as Eastern Bloc's language of internal political communication. There are no Russian minorities in these countries, in schools the primary foreign language is English and nowadays the Russian language practically does not exist.\nGerman.\nGerman is used as a lingua franca in Switzerland to some extent; however, English is generally preferred to avoid favoring it over the three other official languages. German remains a widely studied language in Central Europe and the Balkans, especially in former Yugoslavia. It is recognized as an official language in countries outside of Europe, specifically Namibia. German is also one of the working languages of the EU along with English and French, but it is used less in that role than the other two.\nPolish.\nHistorically, Polish language was a lingua franca, important both diplomatically and academically in Central and part of Eastern Europe. It is currently an official language in Poland and the European Union and a recognised minority language in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, \nCzech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine. In the United States, Polish Americans number more than 11 million.\nPortuguese.\nPortuguese served as lingua franca in the Portuguese Empire, Africa, South America and Asia in the 15th and 16th centuries. When the Portuguese started exploring the seas of Africa, America, Asia and Oceania, they tried to communicate with the natives by mixing a Portuguese-influenced version of lingua franca with the local languages. When Dutch, English or French ships came to compete with the Portuguese, the crews tried to learn this \"broken Portuguese\". Through a process of change the lingua franca and Portuguese lexicon was replaced with the languages of the people in contact. Portuguese remains an important lingua franca in the Portuguese-speaking African countries, East Timor, and to a certain extent in Macau where it is recognized as an official language alongside Chinese though in practice not commonly spoken. Portuguese and Spanish have a certain degree of mutual intelligibility and mixed languages such as Portu\u00f1ol are used to facilitate communication in areas like the border area between Brazil and Uruguay.\nHindustani.\nThe Hindustani language, with Hindi and Urdu as dual standard varieties, serves as the lingua franca of Pakistan and Northern India. Many Hindi-speaking North Indian states have adopted the three-language formula in which students are taught: \"(a) Hindi (with Sanskrit as part of the composite course); (b) Any other modern Indian language including Urdu and (c) English or any other modern European language.\" The order in non-Hindi speaking states is: \"(a) the major language of the state or region; (b) Hindi; (c) Any other modern Indian language including Urdu but excluding (a) and (b) above; and (d) English or any other modern European language.\" Hindi has also emerged as a lingua franca in Arunachal Pradesh, a linguistically diverse state in Northeast India. It is estimated that nine-tenths of the state's population knows Hindi.\nUrdu is the lingua franca of Pakistan and had gained significant influence amongst its people, administration and education. While it shares official status with English, Urdu is the preferred and dominant language used for inter-communication between different ethnic groups of Pakistan.\nMalay.\nMalay is understood across a cultural region in Southeast Asia called the \"Malay world\" including Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, southern Thailand, and certain parts of the Philippines. It is pluricentric, with several nations codifying a local vernacular variety into several national literary standards: Although Javanese has more native speakers, Indonesia uses a standardized form of Riau Malay as the basis for the national language \"Indonesian.\" Bahasa Indonesia is the sole official language even though it is the mother tongue of only 7% of Indonesians.\nSwahili.\nSwahili developed as a lingua franca between several Bantu-speaking tribal groups on the east coast of Africa with heavy influence from Arabic. The earliest examples of writing in Swahili are from 1711. In the early 19th century the use of Swahili as a lingua franca moved inland with the Arabic ivory and slave traders. It was eventually adopted by Europeans as well during periods of colonization in the area. German colonizers used it as the language of administration in German East Africa, later becoming Tanganyika, which influenced the choice to use it as a national language in what is now independent Tanzania. Swahili is currently one of the national languages and it is taught in schools and universities in several East African countries, thus prompting it to be regarded as a modern-day lingua franca by many people in the region. Several Pan-African writers and politicians have unsuccessfully called for Swahili to become the lingua franca of Africa as a means of unifying the African continent and overcoming the legacy of colonialism.\nPersian.\nPersian, an Iranian language, is the official language of Iran, Afghanistan (Dari) and Tajikistan (Tajik). It acts as a lingua franca in both Iran and Afghanistan between the various ethnic groups in those countries. The Persian language in South Asia, before the British colonized the Indian subcontinent, was the region's lingua franca and a widely used official language in north India and Pakistan.\nHausa.\nHausa is the language of communication between speakers of different languages in Northern Nigeria and other West African countries, including the northern region of Ghana.\nAmharic.\nAmharic is the lingua franca and most widely spoken language in Ethiopia, and is known by most people who speak another Ethiopian language.\nCreole languages.\nCreoles, such as Nigerian Pidgin in Nigeria, are used as lingua francas across the world. This is especially true in Africa, the Caribbean, Melanesia, Southeast Asia and in parts of Australia by Indigenous Australians.\nSign languages.\nThe majority of pre-colonial North American nations communicated internationally using Hand Talk. Also called Prairie Sign Language, Plains Indian Sign Language, or First Nations Sign Language, this language functioned predominantly\u2014and still continues to function\u2014as a second language within most of the (now historical) countries of the Great Plains, from Newe Segobia in the West to Anishinaabewaki in the East, down into what are now the northern states of Mexico and up into Cree Country stopping before Denendeh. The relationship remains unknown between Hand Talk and other manual Indigenous languages like Keresan Sign Language and Plateau Sign Language, the latter of which is now extinct (though Ktunaxa Sign Language is still used). Although unrelated, perhaps Inuit Sign Language played and continues to play a similar role across Inuit Nunangat and the various Inuit dialects. The original Hand Talk is found across Indian Country in pockets, but it has also been employed to create new or revive old languages, such as with Oneida Sign Language.\nInternational Sign, though a pidgin language, is present at most significant international gatherings, from which interpretations of national sign languages are given, such as in LSF, ASL, BSL, Libras, or Auslan. International Sign, or IS and formerly Gestuno, interpreters can be found at many European Union parliamentary or committee sittings, during certain United Nations affairs, conducting international sporting events like the Deaflympics, in all World Federation of the Deaf functions, and across similar settings. The language has few set internal grammatical rules, instead co-opting national vocabularies of the speaker and audience, and modifying the words to bridge linguistic gaps, with heavy use of gestures and classifiers.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

She was the fourth wife of Mao Zedong, the Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and Paramount leader of China. Jiang was best known for playing a major role in the Cultural Revolution as the leader of the radical Gang of Four.\nBorn into a declining family with an abusive father and a mother who worked as a domestic servant and sometime prostitute, Jiang Qing became a renowned actress in Shanghai, and later the wife of Mao Zedong in Yan'an, in the 1930s. In the 1940s, she worked as Mao Zedong's personal secretary, and during the 1950s, she headed the Film Section of the Publicity Department of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).\nAppointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group in 1966, Jiang played a pivotal role as Mao's emissary during the early stages of the Cultural Revolution. Collaborating with Lin Biao, she advanced Mao's ideology and promoted his cult of personality. Jiang wielded considerable influence over state affairs, particularly in culture and the arts. Propaganda posters idolised her as the \"Great Flagbearer of the Proletarian Revolution.\" In 1969, she secured a seat on the Politburo, cementing her power.\nFollowing Mao's death, she was soon arrested by Hua Guofeng and his allies in 1976. State media portrayed her as the \"White-Boned Demon,\" and she was widely blamed for instigating the Cultural Revolution, a period of upheaval that caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people. Initially sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve in a televised trial, Jiang's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983. Released for medical treatment in the early 1990s, she committed suicide in May 1991.\nNames.\nChinese names.\nJiang Qing was known by various names throughout her life, as well as Madam Mao. Before her birth, her father named the baby Li Jinnan, where Jinnan means the \"coming boy.\" When she was born, her father changed the name to Li Jinhai, meaning the \"coming child.\" Therefore, Jiang Qing also called herself Li Jin. Several other sources indicate her birth name Li Shumeng, which means \"pure and simple.\"\nShe adopted the name Li Yunhe during primary school. She told her biographer Roxane Witke that she liked the name because \"Yunhe,\" meaning \"crane in the cloud,\" sounded beautiful. In July 1933, during her first visit to Shanghai, she assumed the name Li He and worked as a teacher for local workers. On her second visit to Shanghai in June 1934, she used the alias Zhang Shuzhen. Later, when detained by the Nationalist government in October 1934, she identified herself as Li Yungu.\nIn 1935, when she entered the entertainment industry, she took on the stage name Lan Ping, which means \"blue apple\". Although the name had no particular meaning, its bluntness made it unique. However, Jiang Qing did not favour this name due to its association with her scandals in Shanghai. She became known as Jiang Qing upon arriving in Yan'an, where \"Jiang\" means \"river\" and \"Qing\" means \"azure\" or \"better than blue\".\nIn 1991, when she was hospitalised in Beijing, she used the name Li Runqing. When she died in Beijing, her body was labelled with the pseudonym Li Zi. In March 2002, she was buried in Beijing by her school name Li Yunhe.\nEnglish names.\nIn English, many contemporary articles used the Wade\u2013Giles romanisation system to spell Chinese names. For this reason, some sources \u2013 especially older ones \u2013 spell her name \"Chiang Ch'ing\", while newer sources use Pinyin and spell her name \"Jiang Qing\". She was also known as Madame Mao, as the wife and widow of Mao Zedong. In accordance with Chinese customs in which women retain their maiden names after marriage, her surname remained unchanged in Chinese.\nEarly life.\nJiang Qing was born in Zhucheng, Shandong, in March 1914. She deliberately kept her exact birth date private to avoid receiving any gifts. Her father was Li Dewen, a carpenter, and her mother, whose name is unknown, was Li's subsidiary wife, or concubine. Her father had his own carpentry and cabinet making workshop. Her parents were married after her father initially found his first wife unable to conceive.\nAs a child, Jiang was deeply traumatised by the domestic violence inflicted by her father, who verbally and physically abused her mother almost every day. One Lantern Festival, after her father broke her mother's finger during an attack, her mother fled with Jiang under the cover of darkness. Her mother found work as a domestic servant that often blurred the lines with prostitution, and her husband separated from her.\nJiang eventually moved with her mother to her grandparents' home in Jinan. However, they soon returned to Zhucheng, as her mother continued to seek inheritance rights, or financial support, from her husband's family, which proved extremely difficult. During this period, Jiang attended two primary schools with disruptions, where she was often mocked for wearing outdated, boyish clothing from her brothers. She became silent and not easy to open up.\nHer mother, having fallen ill, eventually abandoned hope of obtaining further financial support from her husband. After selling some of her belongings, she purchased a train ticket, and together with Jiang, boarded a train from Jiaoxian to Jinan. There, Jiang was welcomed by her grandparents and resumed her primary education. In 1926\u20131927, her mother took her further north to Tianjin to stay with her half-sister. During this time, Jiang worked as a housekeeper in the household. She proposed taking a job rolling cigarettes, but the family disapproved. Later they returned to Jinan, where her mother died in 1928.\nEntertainment career.\nJinan.\nAt 14, Jiang, now an orphan, joined a local underground theatre troupe, seeking independence. Her striking looks drew attention, but she remained sensitive about her poor upbringing. Alarmed by her undisclosed departure, her grandparents paid the troupe's boss to bring her back. She enrolled in the Experimental Arts Academy, which became less picky about the social class of new entrants due to the May Fourth Movement. Despite her strong Shandong accent initially hindering her performances, she excelled during her year of training, in some traditional opera roles. When the academy closed in 1930, Jiang, though only half-trained, was chosen to join theatrical companies in Beijing. She returned to Jinan in May 1931 and married Pei Minglun, the wealthy son of a businessman, and soon divorced.\nQingdao.\nFollowing her divorce, Jiang reached out to Zhao Taimou, the former director of the Arts Academy and dean of Qingdao University. With the assistance of Zhao's wife, Yu Shan, Jiang secured a position as a clerk in the university library. Yu Shan later introduced Jiang to her brother, Yu Qiwei, an upper-class youth who had embraced the Communist cause and was connected to underground Communist organisations as well as literary and performing arts circles.\nThe Mukden Incident in September ignited her patriotism, leading her to develop a dislike for the Kuomintang and its supporters. By the end of 1932, Jiang and Yu Qiwei fell in love and began living together, enabling Jiang to gain entry into the Communist Cultural Front. She became a member of the Seaside Drama Society, performing in plays such as \"Lay Down Your Whip\", harnessing the influence of theatre to resist Japanese aggression. In February 1933, she officially joined the CCP.\nThe Communist activities at Qingdao University attracted significant attention from the Kuomintang's secret police, who arrested Yu Qiwei in July, forcing Jiang to leave Qingdao.\nShanghai.\nAfter the arrest of Yu Qiwei, Yu Shan arranged for Jiang to move to Shanghai. With a recommendation from Tian Han's younger brother, Tian Luan, she enrolled as a visiting student at the Great China University in Shanghai. In July, with endorsements from Tian Han and his associates, Jiang became a teacher at the Chengeng Workers' School, an institution organised by Tao Xingzhi. During this time, Yu Qiwei was released and visited her in Shanghai. In October, Jiang re-joined the Chinese Communist Youth League, became a member of the League of Left-Wing Educators, and resumed her career as a drama actress.\nShe performed in the Shanghai Work Study Troupe. Jiang was among the cast of a production of \"Roar, China!\" which British authorities banned from being performed in Shanghai's International Settlement.\nIn September 1934, Jiang was arrested and jailed for her political activities in Shanghai. During her arrest in Shanghai, Jiang Qing was interrogated by a Zhongtong agent, Zhao Yaoshan. Jiang had once revealed to Zhao that Tan Xiaoqing was a CCP member, leading to Tan's arrest. She was released three months later, in December. She then traveled to Beijing where she reunited with Yu Qiwei who had just been released following his prison sentence, and the two began living together again. \nShe returned to Shanghai in March 1935, and entered Diantong Film Company. She became famous when featuring in Ibsen's play \"A Doll's House\" as Nora. She later became an actress in \"Goddess of Freedom\" and \"Scenes of City Life\", during which she fell in love with Tang Na, her colleague at Diantong. The two began living together in September 1935. However, Jiang lied to Tang, claiming her mother was ill, and returned to Tianjin to see Yu Qiwei. When Tang discovered the truth, he attempted suicide in Jinan but later reconciled with Jiang and returned with her to Shanghai in July 1935. Later they were married in a collective wedding ceremony at Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou in April 1936.In Shanghai, Jiang joined Lianhua Film Company, where she acted in \"Blood on Wolf Mountain\" and \"Lianhua Symphony\". During this period, she began an affair with film director Zhang Min, appeared in his production \"The Storm\". She also became an actress in \"Wang Laowu\". However, during the second performance of \"The Storm\" in May 1937, Tang attempted suicide again. Following this incident, Jiang divorced Tang and started living with Zhang Min, but the relationship cost her career as she was dismissed by Lianhua Film Company.\nJiang's widely publicised affair with Tang Na tarnished her reputation, making it difficult for her to continue her acting career in Shanghai. Like many youths of her time, she was drawn to the progressive ideals associated with Yan'an. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident in July 1937, which marked the start of Japan's full-scale invasion of China, further galvanised young activists to advocate for a united front. Yan'an, promoted through Communist propaganda, emerged as a symbol of democracy, freedom, and hope. She left Shanghai in July, after which the Japanese invasion in Shanghai started on 13 August.\nEarly political activities.\nYan'an.\nDrama teacher.\nShe went first to Xi'an, then to Yan'an. In November, she enrolled in the Counter-Japanese Military and Political University for study. The Lu Xun Academy of Arts was newly founded in Yan'an on 10 April 1938, and Jiang became a drama department instructor, teaching and performing in college plays and operas. The conditions in Yan'an were harsh, but Jiang was able to make it there and persist. Jiang was striking in appearance and had several talents; she could sing opera, write well, and her calligraphy was particularly impressive, especially in regular script. On one hand, she was relatively quiet and reserved\u2014she didn't enjoy shooting, but liked playing poker, knitting, and was skilled at creating various patterns. She was also adept at tailoring and made her own clothes beautifully. On the other hand, she had a lively and bold side\u2014Jiang enjoyed horseback riding, especially taming wild horses; the more ferocious the horse, the more she liked to ride it. This combination of traits allowed her to excel as both a homemaker and adapt to the tough, military lifestyle, earning the admiration of revolutionary leaders.\nSecret marriage.\nIn the autumn of 1937, He Zizhen, the wife of Mao Zedong, left Yan'an. When news of Jiang Qing's romance with Mao Zedong broke, it sparked significant opposition. The most vocal critic was Zhang Wentian, who believed that He, as an outstanding CCP member, having endured the Long March and sustained multiple injuries, deserved respect. However, some felt that Mao Zedong's personal matters, including his choice of a wife, were his own business, and others should not interfere. Among those who supported Mao, the most vocal was Kang Sheng.Figures like Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi, however, were more cautious in their support of Jiang Qing. They sent telegrams to the Communist leadership in Shanghai, requesting them to clarify Jiang's conduct in Shanghai, where she was suspected of being a \"secret agent\" of the Kuomintang. Yang Fan, a party leader in Shanghai, secretly written to Yan'an arguing that Jiang was unsuitable for marriage to Mao.\nNevertheless, on 28 November 1938, Jiang Qing married Mao Zedong with the eventual approval of the Politburo, but with three restrictions as follows:\nIn the early years of their marriage, Mao Zedong and Jiang Qing shared a harmonious life. Jiang primarily took on the role of a homemaker, attending to Mao's daily needs. In 1940, she gave birth to their daughter, Li Na. After Li Na's birth, Jiang Qing largely withdrew from the public eye.\nBeijing and Moscow.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Sex is engaging in the first rounds; what sustains interest in the long run is power.\u2014\u200a\nFirst Lady.\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Jiang Qing became the nation's first lady. However, her role was concealed from the general public in China or beyond throughout the 1950s. During the 1950s, Jiang Qing left a generally favourable impression on those who interacted with her. In 1949, after Soong Ching-ling attended the founding ceremony in Beijing and returned to Shanghai, Mao Zedong sent Jiang Qing to see her off at the train station. It is said that Soong later remarked that Jiang was \"polite and likeable.\" In 1956, Soong hosted Indonesian President Sukarno at a banquet in Shanghai, where Jiang and Liu Shaoqi\u2019s wife, Wang Guangmei, were also present. Soong reportedly praised Jiang for her refined manners and tasteful attire. During their conversation, Jiang even asked Soong to encourage Mao to wear a tie and suits, noting that Sun Yat-sen often did so and suggesting that foreigners found the simplicity of Chinese officials' clothing too monotonous.\nFilm bureaucracy.\nShe served as the deputy director of the Film Guidance Committee, overseeing the evaluation of film projects from 1949 to 1951. In 1951, Jiang Qing was given a minor position of Film Bureau Chief. After her appointment, Jiang engaged in three attempts in establishing the standard for socialist art. Jiang's first attempt was her advice to ban the 1950 Hong Kong movie \"Sorrows of the Forbidden City\", of which Jiang believed to be unpatriotic. Her opinion was not taken seriously by the communist leadership due to the minor political influence of her office and the movie was distributed in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Mao intervened to support her.\nLater that year, Jiang critiqued and objected to the distribution of the movie \"The Life of Wu Xun\" for glorifying the wealthy landed class while dismissing the peasantry. Again, Jiang's opinion was dismissed. Mao had to intervene to support her again.\nJiang's third attempt involved the role of literary criticism in the development of socialist art. She asked the editor of \"People's Daily\" to republish the new literary interpretation of the classic novel \"Dream of Red Mansions\" by two young scholars at Shandong University. The editor refused Jiang's request on the grounds that the party newspaper was not a forum for free debate. Again, Mao spoke up on Jiang's behalf.\nJiang was a member of the Ministry of Culture's steering committee for film production.155\nMedical treatment.\nJiang was in poor health for much of the 1950s, leading her to step back from her official duties. As a result, she had to move back and forth between Beijing and Moscow. In 1949, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer and underwent four rounds of treatment in the Soviet Union. In March 1949, she travelled to Moscow and Yalta, returning in the autumn. She visited Moscow again in 1952, staying until the autumn of 1953. Due to severe pain in her liver, while the Chinese doctors were unable to fulfil their duties due to the Three-Antis Movement, the Soviet doctors explored her liver through surgery. Her life in the Soviet Union was rather reclusive, with only Russian doctors, nurses, bodyguards, and all reading materials only from the Chinese diplomatic mission. In 1956, she made another trip to the Soviet Union for treatment and returned in 1957.\nDuring this period, as a foreign dignitary, she gained access to a wide range of films banned in the Soviet Union, including many Hollywood productions. This exposure allowed her to stay informed about Western art trends, which later influenced her transformation of the Peking Opera. In 1957, Jiang recovered from cervical cancer, though she believed she was still unwell, contrary to her doctors\u2019 assessment of her good health. Therefore, they recommended that she engage in therapeutic activities such as watching films, listening to music, and attending theatre and concerts.\nCover-up.\nDuring the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries, Zhao Yaoshan, the Zhongtong agent who interrogated Jiang during her arrest in the 1930s, was executed. In January 1953, Yang Fan, who had secretly written to Yan'an about Jiang's experiences in Shanghai, was imprisoned. Pan Hannian, the Communist intelligence chief who defended Yang, was also jailed.\nIn December, Mao Zedong travelled to Hangzhou with Jiang Qing. After his departure on 14 March, Jiang received an anonymous letter from Shanghai later that month, which mentioned Jiang's scandals and betrayal in Shanghai. Initially disturbed and then angered, she sought out Zhejiang provincial party chief Tan Qilong, asserting her revolutionary commitment and requesting an investigation. Despite extensive police efforts, the sender's identity remained unknown.\nIn 1958, while Mao attended a meeting in Nanning, he met Yu Qiwei, who had had a romantic relationship with Jiang. After Mao fiercely criticised the lack of support from Yu and his supervisor Zhou Enlai during the Great Leap Forward, Yu experienced severe mental and physical distress. Upon arriving at Guangzhou Airport, he kowtowed before Li Fuchun, pleading to be \"spared.\" Li then escorted him to a military hospital. There, Yu attempted suicide by jumping out of a window, resulting in a broken leg. Yu died a few months later, and Mao sent a wreath in his name alone as a gesture of condolence.\nIn 1961, Zhu Ming, the widow of Lin Boqu, wrote to the Party Central Committee regarding her late husband. Her handwriting matched that of the anonymous letter. When confronted, Zhu admitted to writing the letter and subsequently committed suicide.\nCultural Revolution.\nPrelude.\nBefore 1962, the Chinese media never mentioned who Mao Zedong's wife was in its international propaganda. People close to Mao Zedong claimed that after the 1950s, Jiang Qing was rarely seen by his side, and their emotional relationship had essentially ended, leaving her feeling frustrated for a time. However, as the 1960s progressed, Mao became increasingly distrustful of the surrounding leaders and his judgment of the domestic political situation grew more severe. Jiang Qing capitalised on this shift, becoming more outspoken, which led Mao to view her as \"politically sensitive\" and start to trust her. As a result, her power grew steadily.\nAfter Jiang's return to China in 1962, she frequently attended local opera performances. In 1963, Jiang Qing enlisted A Jia to help modernise Beijing Opera with revolutionary socialist themes. She later instructed the Beijing Municipal Opera Company to create \"Shajiabang\", depicting the struggle between the Kuomintang and Communists during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and tasked the Shanghai Beijing Opera Company with producing \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy\". In her first public speech in June 1964 at a Peking Opera convention, Jiang criticised regional opera troupes for glorifying emperors, generals, scholars, and other ox-demons and snake-spirits.\nJiang's efforts to reform Peking Opera gained approval from the Communist leadership, especially during the 1964 Modern Beijing Opera Trial Performance Convention. She also formed a productive collaboration with Yu Huiyong, to push the yangbanxi (model drama) projects. Their shared vision focused on creating operas that reflected modern Chinese society and the lives of the working class, starting with \"On the Docks\", which portrayed Communist-ruled Shanghai. Jiang's political influence helped ensure the success of these projects, which aimed to create revolutionary art that represented the reality of contemporary life.\nCultural reforms.\nFrom 1962 onwards, Jiang Qing began appearing publicly as Mao's wife and later gave frequent speeches in the cultural and propaganda sectors, criticizing and condemning various figures. By late 1965, as Jiang Qing's influence grew, she rallied close allies such as Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan. She organised a campaign to criticise the play \"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\", which marked the beginning of the Cultural Revolution.\nIn February 1966, Jiang hosted a forum with PLA officers, the Military Arts &amp; Literature Work Conference, which she planned in conjunction with Lin Biao. The group studied writings by Mao, watched films and plays, and met with the cast and crew of an in-progress film production. The forum concluded that a \"black line\" of bourgeois thought dominated the arts since the PRC's founding. According to this interpretation, the history of socialist culture was a class struggle between reactionary and proletarian lines, and a large majority of writers failed to resist bourgeois ideological influence.176 The group contended that cultural workers should be totally reorganised.176 A summary of Jiang's analysis at the forum was later distributed widely during the Cultural Revolution and became a significant document.\nOver April through June 1966, Jiang presided over the All-Army Artistic Creation Conference in Beijing. Conference attendees evaluated a total of 80 domestic and foreign films. Jiang approved of 7 as consistent with Mao Zedong Thought and criticised the other films. Backed by her husband, she was appointed deputy director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group (CCRG) in 1966 and emerged as a serious political figure in the summer of that year.\nRevolutionary operas.\nIn 1967, at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution, Jiang declared eight works of performance art to be the new models for proletarian literature and art. These \"model operas\", or \"revolutionary operas\", were designed to glorify Mao Zedong, The People's Liberation Army, and the revolutionary struggles. The ballets \"White-Haired Girl\", \"Red Detachment of Women\", and \"Shajiabang\" (\"Revolutionary Symphonic Music\") were included in the list of eight, and were closely associated with Jiang, because of their inclusion of elements from Chinese and Western opera, dance, and music. The Red Guards condemned Yu Huiyong to be a \"bad element\" for propagating feudalism through his utilisation of traditional Chinese music in operas. Yu was also tagged as \"a democrat hiding under the banner of the Communist Party\" due to his frequent absences in party meetings. In 1966, Yu was subsequently sent to a Cow Shed, a small room where the \"bad elements\" were confined. In October 1966, Yu was released after Jiang requested a meeting with Yu to stage the production of two operas in Beijing. Jiang seated Yu next to her, as a display of Yu's importance in the making of yangbanxi, during the showing of \"Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy\". During Richard Nixon's famous visit to China in February 1972, he watched \"Red Detachment of Women\", and was impressed by the opera. He famously asked Jiang who the writer, director, and composer were, to which she replied it was \"created by the masses.\"\nFashion designs.\nIn 1974, Jiang Qing directed the Ministry of Culture to design a new dress for Chinese women, inspired by elements of women's clothing from the Song dynasty. The dress was called the Jiang Qing Dress. The dress featured a symmetrical V-neckline, differing slightly from the traditional Y-shaped neckline of Hanfu. Mockingly dubbed the \"Nun's Robe,\" Jiang intended for female cadres to lead the way in wearing it, with the eventual goal of making it a nationwide standard.\nPolitical activism.\nDuring this period, Mao galvanised students and young workers as his paramilitary organisation the Red Guards to attack what he termed as revisionists in the party. Mao told them the revolution was in danger and that they must do all they could to stop the emergence of a privileged class in China. He argued this is what had happened in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev. With time, Jiang began playing an increasingly active political role in the movement. She took part in most important Party and government activities. Jiang took advantage of the Cultural Revolution to wreak vengeance on her personal enemies, including people who had slighted her during her acting career in the 1930s. She was supported by a radical coterie, dubbed, by Mao himself, the Gang of Four. She became a prominent member of the Central Cultural Revolution Group and a major player in Chinese politics from 1966 to 1976.\n1966\u20131969.\nFrom 1962, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife Wang Guangmei frequently appeared at diplomatic events, earning Wang the title of \"First Lady,\" which reportedly made Jiang Qing jealous. Before Wang's overseas trips, Jiang advised her not to wear jewellery, claiming it looked better. However, upon seeing Wang on television wearing a necklace, Jiang criticised her for displaying \"bourgeois style\" in a talk with Red Guards. \nOn 13 December 1966, Liu Shaoqi voluntarily offered to resign from his positions as President. He proposed moving with his wife and children to Yan'an or his hometown in Hunan to take up farming, hoping to bring the Cultural Revolution to an early conclusion and minimise the damage to the country. On 18 December, Zhang Chunqiao, deputy head of the Central Cultural Revolution Group, summoned Kuai Dafu, a leader of the Red Guards at Tsinghua University, and instructed him to launch a campaign to overthrow Liu Shaoqi. On 25 December, Kuai Dafu led thousands of demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, where they publicly chanted the slogan \"Down with Liu Shaoqi.\"\nThe Central Cultural Revolution Group was initially a small body under the Standing Committee of the Politburo. With the backing of Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan initiated a coup in Shanghai in January 1967, consolidating power and gaining support from revolutionary factions like Wang Hongwen. On 6 January 1967, Red Guards at Tsinghua University, with Jiang Qing's backing, lured Wang to the campus under the pretext of her daughter being in a car accident. Once there, Wang was detained and prosecuted.\nFollowing the Red Guards' disruption of party structures in January 1967, this group replaced the Secretariat and became the central command for the party. Jiang Qing's role as the \"First Deputy Head\" of the group grew significantly, elevating her political power. Chen Boda, the nominal leader of the group, was repeatedly humiliated by Jiang Qing during this period. Fearing her power, he endured her mistreatment in silence. In one notable incident, after a middle school student scaled his wall, Chen's wife reported the event, sparking a \"footprint incident\" that enraged Jiang Qing. She demanded Chen move out of Zhongnanhai, and this further strained his relationship with her. Seizing the opportunity, Lin Biao and his wife, Ye Qun, aligned with Chen, who quietly defected to their faction.\nOn 18 July 1967, a public struggle session against Liu Shaoqi was held in Zhongnanhai. On 5 August, the Central Cultural Revolution Group approved three separate struggle sessions targeting Liu Shaoqi and his wife, Deng Xiaoping and his wife, and Tao Zhu and his wife. From that point, Liu Shaoqi was completely stripped of his personal freedom. On 16 September 1968, under Jiang Qing's leadership, a special investigation team compiled three volumes of so-called evidence against Liu, largely extracted through torture and coercion. After being imprisoned in Zhongnanhai for over two years, Liu Shaoqi was transferred to Kaifeng, Henan Province, on 17 October 1969, where he subsequently died.\nMeanwhile, Jiang's stature continued to rise, though she was still not a member of the Central Committee during the 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee. At the 9th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in April 1969, Jiang was admitted to the Politburo after Mao Zedong shifted his stance, likely to balance the power of the Lin Biao faction. Mao also approved the entry of Lin Biao's wife, Ye Qun, into the Politburo, further consolidating their influence.\n1969\u20131971.\nAt the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party, Jiang condemned quotation songs, which had been promoted since September 1966 as mnemonic devices for the study of \"Quotations\" \"from Chairman Mao Zedong\".43 Jiang had come to view the popular tunes as akin to yellow music.43\nJiang's rivalry with, and personal dislike of, Zhou Enlai led Jiang to hurt Zhou where he was most vulnerable. In 1968, Jiang had Zhou's adopted son (Sun Yang) and daughter (Sun Weishi) tortured and murdered by Red Guards. Sun Yang was murdered in the basement of Renmin University. After Sun Weishi died following seven months of torture in a secret prison (at Jiang's direction), Jiang made sure that Sun's body was cremated and disposed of so that no autopsy could be performed and Sun's family could not have her ashes. In 1968, Jiang forced Zhou to sign an arrest warrant for his own brother. In 1973 and 1974, Jiang directed the \"Criticise Lin, Criticise Confucius\" campaign against premier Zhou because Zhou was viewed as one of Jiang's primary political opponents. In 1975, Jiang initiated a campaign named \"Criticizing Song Jiang, Evaluating the Water Margin\", which encouraged the use of Zhou as an example of a political loser. After Zhou Enlai died in 1976, Jiang initiated the \"Five Nos\" campaign in order to discourage and prohibit any public mourning for Zhou. When traditional landscape and bird-and-flower paintings re-emerged in the early 1970s, Jiang criticised these traditional forms as \"black paintings\", which in fact targeted Zhou Enlai.\n1971\u20131973.\nJiang first collaborated with then second-in-charge Lin Biao, but after Lin Biao's death in 1971, she turned against him publicly in the Criticise Lin, Criticise Confucius Campaign. After the September 13 Incident in 1971, Jiang Qing saw the collapse of the Lin Biao faction and, with Mao Zedong's declining health, she became eager to seize the highest power in the country. In 1972, Jiang Qing enlisted American scholar Roxane Witke to write her autobiography. After 1972, Mao's health deteriorated. Though Mao was largely cut off from the outside world due to his illness, Zhu De sent Mao a letter informing him about Jiang Qing's biography. This revelation deeply angered Mao, who, in a fit of rage, even expressed his desire to expel Jiang Qing from the Politburo and sever their political ties. By 1973, although unreported due to it being a personal matter, Mao and his wife Jiang had separated.\n1973\u20131976.\nOn 10 March 1973, Deng Xiaoping was reinstated as Vice Premier, serving as Zhou Enlai's deputy. During the 10th National Congress of the CCP, Deng remained a member of the Central Committee but he did not gain a seat on the Politburo. On 10 April 1974, Deng led the Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Although Jiang Qing strongly opposed Deng's appointment, Mao Zedong cautioned her in a letter to cease opposing his decision.\nAfter Zhou Enlai was hospitalised, Wang Hongwen managed the Politburo, Deng Xiaoping oversaw the State Council, and Ye Jianying led the Central Military Commission. On 4 October 1974, Mao Zedong proposed appointing Deng as First Vice Premier. Sensing that Deng might replace Zhou Enlai at the upcoming Fourth National People's Congress, Jiang Qing attempted to block Deng from taking charge of the State Council and the Party's central operations.\nOn 12 December, Mao reaffirmed his support for Deng by proposing his appointment as a member of both the Military Commission and the Politburo\u2014a suggestion that gained majority approval from Politburo members. On 23 December, despite his ill health, Zhou Enlai flew to Changsha to meet Mao and seek his endorsement of Deng Xiaoping, with Wang Hongwen also in attendance. Mao agreed and, while pointing at Wang, remarked that Deng's \"politics\" is better than his.\"\" Mao spoke English for the word \"politics.\" Wang was embarrassed as he did not understand.\nDownfall.\nProtests.\nBy the mid-1970s, Jiang spearheaded the campaign against Deng Xiaoping. Yet, the Chinese public became intensely discontented at politics and chose to blame Jiang, a more accessible and easier target than Mao.\nIn January 1976, official news announced the death of Zhou Enlai. Zhou was highly respected in Chinese society, second only to Mao Zedong in influence. However, no official commemorative activities were organised following his death. On 5 March and 25 March, \"Wenhui Daily\" published two reports criticising Deng Xiaoping, indirectly accusing Zhou Enlai of being the \"biggest capitalist roader\" who had supported and protected Deng. Starting on 21 March, students at Nanjing University began questioning and condemning \"Wenhui Daily\" and the criticisms of Zhou in Shanghai. On 29 March, the students escalated their protests by writing large slogans on trains departing from Nanjing, spreading their message nationwide. On 30 March, members of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, including Cao Zhijie, posted signed wall posters in Beijing. These posters transformed the veiled political dissent into open protest, marking the beginning of the Tiananmen protests in Beijing.\nMany Chinese instinctively believe that it was Jiang Qing who ordered the removal of the wreaths dedicated to Zhou Enlai from Tiananmen Square. In response, slogans appeared, such as \"Down with the Empress Dowager, down with Indira Gandhi.\" Another individual placed a wreath in honour of Mao's revered second wife, Yang Kaihui, who had been executed by Chiang Kai-shek in 1930. Jiang Qing was often referred to obliquely as \"that woman\" or \"three drops of water,\" a reference to part of the Chinese character for her name. The protests eventually evolved into a riot, with cars ignited by angry protesters and militia intervention.\nCoup d'\u00e9tat.\nOn 5 September 1976, Jiang Qing was informed of the critical illness of Mao Zedong and soon returned to Beijing. On the evening of 8 September, she drove to Xinhua News Agency trying to find supporters, and returned to Zhongnanhai late in night, where high-rank Chinese officials and Mao's family members were present. Jiang could not fall asleep. She needed to confront two other factions within the party, Hua Guofeng, who had already received a note from Mao saying, \"With you in charge, I am at ease\", and Deng Xiaoping, who was being attacked by Jiang. She approached Hua secretly, proposing to expel Deng in the Politburo meeting before Mao's death, but she did not succeed.\nMao died on 9 September. The funeral services were hosted by Wang Hongwen, with a million people assembled at Tiananmen Square to mourn his death. Jiang sent a large wreath of chrysanthemums and greenery, as his student and comrade, rather than his widow. Hua was the designated successor of Mao and soon became the party chief and became embroiled in a power struggle with the Gang of Four. Jiang went to Baoding to rally the 38th Army, preparing to replace Hua as a party chief. In response, both Ye Jianying, one of Deng's allies, and Hua mobilised their military forces in Beijing and Guangzhou. Xu Shiyou warned a north expedition from Guangzhou, if Jiang had not been arrested in Beijing. In 4\u20135 October, Hua continued to negotiate with Jiang's allies on the personnel arrangement and agreed to continue the talk the following day.\nOn 6 October, Zhang Chunqiao and Wang Hongwen were arrested when they arrived at Zhongnanhai. Jiang Qing and Yao Wenyuan were arrested at their homes. Hua \u2013 supported by the military and state security \u2013 had Jiang and the rest of the Gang arrested and removed from their party positions. According to Zhang Yaoci, who carried out the arrest, Jiang did not say much when she was arrested. It was reported that one of her servants spat at her as she was being taken away under a flurry of blows by onlookers and police. In May 1975, Mao Zedong once criticised the Gang of Four for leaning too heavily on empiricism. However, he downplayed the severity of their issue, stating that it was not a significant problem but needed to be addressed. Mao remarked,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;If it cannot be resolved in the first half of the year, then address it in the second half; if it cannot be resolved this year, then next year; and if not next year, then the year after.\nThe remark served as a justification for Hua Guofeng to arrest the Gang of Four.\nTelevised trial.\nHua was later outmaneuvered and replaced by Deng Xiaoping, who proceeded with prosecuting Jiang. At the time of her arrest, the country lacked the proper institutions for a legal trial. As a result, she and the other members of the Gang of Four were held in a state of limbo for the first six months of their capture. Following prompt legal modernisation, an indictment was brought forward, formally titled \"Indictment of the Special Procuratorate under the Supreme People's Procuratorate of the People\u2019s Republic of China.\" The indictment contained 48 separate counts.\nIn November 1980, the government announced that Jiang and nine others would stand trial. She was tried with the other three members of the Gang of Four and six associates. She was accused of persecuting artists during the Cultural Revolution, and authorising the burgling of the homes of writers and performers in Shanghai to destroy material related to Jiang's early career that could harm her reputation. Xinhua News Agency reported that Jiang initially sought to recruit her own lawyers but rejected those recommended by the special team after interviews. Meanwhile, five of the ten defendants agreed to be represented by government-appointed lawyers who would act as their defence counsel.\nJiang was defiant in the court. She argued to the special prosecution teams that Mao should also be held accountable for her actions. Whenever a witness took the stand, there was a chance the court proceedings would devolve into a shouting match. She did not deny the accusations, and insisted that she had been protecting Mao and following his instructions. Jiang remarked:\nHer defence strategy was marked by attempts to transcend the court room and appeal to history and the logic of revolution. Jiang sought to challenge Hua Guofeng's authority within the Party, with a significant yet unverifiable claim,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;[A]bout that night Mao Zedong wrote the words, \"With you in charge, I'm at ease\" for Hua Guofeng. [...] That was not all Chairman Mao wrote to Hua. He wrote six more characters: \"If you have questions, ask Jiang Qing.\"\nThe court announced its verdict after six weeks of testimony and debate and four weeks of deliberations. In early 1981, she was convicted and sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve. She was assigned the highest level of criminal liability among the defendants as a \"ringleader\" of a counterrevolutionary group. Wu Xiuquan recounted in his memoir that the court room erupted into applause as the verdict was read and Jiang Qing was dragged out of the court room by two female guards while shouting revolutionary slogans.\nDeath and burial.\nInternment and illness.\nFollowing her arrest, Jiang Qing was held at Qincheng Prison, where she occupied herself with activities such as reading newspapers, listening to radio broadcasts, watching television, knitting, studying books, and writing. Her daughter, Li Na, visited her fortnightly. Jiang was reportedly treated well during her sentence. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1983. The Supreme People's Court determined that both Jiang and her chief associate, Zhang, had demonstrated \"sufficient repentance\" during their two-year reprieve, leading to their death sentences being commuted. However, senior Chinese officials stated that Jiang had not shown genuine remorse and remained as defiant as the day she was removed from a crowded courtroom, shouting, \"Long Live the Revolution.\"\nIn 1984, Jiang was granted medical parole and relocated to a discreet residence arranged by the authorities. In December 1988, on the occasion of Mao Zedong's 95th birth anniversary, Jiang requested approval to hold a family gathering, but her petition was denied. Distressed, she attempted suicide by ingesting 50 sleeping pills she had secretly saved. The attempt failed. She was later sent back to Qincheng Prison in 1989 when her medical parole concluded. Jiang Qing believed that Deng Xiaoping should be held responsible for the student movement (better known as the Tiananmen Square protests), as he tolerated Western ideologies. She also condemned the subsequent massacre that followed the protests, emphasising that Mao Zedong had never ordered the army to massacre crowds. While in custody, Jiang was diagnosed with throat cancer, and doctors advised surgery. She refused, asserting that losing her voice was unacceptable.\nSuicide.\nOn 15 March 1991, Jiang Qing was transferred to the Beijing Police Hospital from her residence at Jiuxianqiao due to a high fever. By 18 March, her fever had subsided. She was then moved to a ward within the hospital compound, which included a bedroom, bathroom, and living room. On 10 May 1991, she tore apart her memoir manuscript in front of others and expressed a wish to return to her home. Two days later, on 12 May, her daughter and son-in-law came to visit her in the hospital after learning about her condition, but Jiang declined to meet them. On 14 May 1991, Jiang Qing committed suicide. At 3:30\u00a0a.m., a nurse entered her room and found her hanging above the bathtub, having died. The suicide note read,\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Today the revolution has been stolen by the revisionist clique of Deng, Peng Zhen, and Yang Shangkun. Chairman Mao exterminated Liu Shaoqi, but not Deng, and the result of this omission is that unending evils have been unleashed on the Chinese people and nation. Chairman, your student and fighter is coming to see you!\nThat afternoon, Li Na, went to the hospital to sign the death certificate and agreed that no funeral or memorial service would be held. On 18 May, Jiang Qing's remains were cremated. Neither Li Na nor any of Jiang Qing's other relatives attended the cremation. Jiang Qing's ashes were entrusted to Li Na, who kept them at her home. The Chinese government confirmed that she had hanged herself on 4 June, withholding the announcement for two weeks to avoid its impact before the second anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen protests.\nHowever, He Diankui, a former staff of Qincheng Prison, later claimed that \"Jiang Qing never left Qincheng Prison until her death.\" He suggested that she died in the prison from taking sleeping pills, which refuted the official report regarding her death.\nBurial.\nWhile imprisoned, Jiang Qing expressed in her will a desire to be buried in her hometown of Zhucheng, Shandong. In 1996, Yan Changgui, Jiang Qing's former secretary, visited Zhucheng, where the city's Party Secretary asked him to convey to Li Na that Jiang Qing could be buried there, pending her consent. However, after the 16th National Congress of the CCP, Jiang Zemin suggested to Li Na that Zhucheng might not be a secure burial site. Instead, Li Na inquired about the possibility of burial in Beijing, which Jiang Zemin approved. Li Na arranged the burial at her own expense. In March 2002, Jiang Qing's ashes were interred at the Futian Cemetery in Beijing's Western Hills scenic area. The tombstone reads: \"The Grave of Mother Li Yunhe, 1914\u20131991, respectfully erected by her daughter, son-in-law, and grandson.\"\nLegacy.\nPublic image.\nJiang Qing was never a widely admired figure throughout her life. Her marriage to Mao in the 1930s scandalised many of the more puritanical comrades in Yan'an. During the Cultural Revolution, she did little to win the favour of other Chinese leaders.\nJiang Qing is often viewed as a figure of naked ambition, with many perceiving her as a typical power-hungry wife of an emperor, seeking to secure power for herself through questionable means. Her public image is largely shaped by her self-serving narrative, which portrays her as a central figure in the turbulent and cutthroat environment of Chinese leadership. She is seen as embodying the ruthless, unpredictable, and dangerous nature of life at the top. Her long-standing vendetta against former cultural-political rivals from her acting days in Shanghai has fueled her reputation for vindictiveness. Though she framed her conflicts with these men as ideological battles, it is widely believed that personal grudges and animosities were the true driving forces behind her actions.\nAccording to Roxane Witke, Jiang's early life was marked by poverty, hunger, and violence, and later, as a woman in a male-dominated world, she faced numerous challenges. These experiences shaped her defensive and aggressive personality, fostering an opportunism that persisted even when she no longer needed to assert herself. Jiang's televised trials and her defiance in court have softened hatred towards her among the younger generations, who became sceptical of China's Communist system.\nOfficial historiography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Verse translation/styles.css\" /&gt;\n\u2014\u90ed\u6cab\u82e5\u300a\u6c34\u8c03\u6b4c\u5934\u00b7\u7c89\u788e\u56db\u4eba\u5e2e\u300b(1976)\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Screen reader-only/styles.css\" /&gt;Translation:\u2014\"Crackdown on the Gang of Four\", Guo Moruo (1976)\nAfter Jiang Qing's arrest in 1976, the Chinese government launched a massive propaganda campaign to vilify her and the other members of the so-called Gang of Four. Orchestrated under the authoritarian political culture of Mao's successor Hua Guofeng, this campaign aimed to discredit Jiang and her associates entirely. In the years leading to her trial in 1980, millions of posters and cartoons depicted the Gang of Four as class enemies and spies. Jiang herself became the primary target of ridicule, portrayed as an empress scheming to succeed Mao and as a prostitute, with references to her past as a Shanghai actress used to question her moral integrity. The propaganda also criticised her interest in Western pastimes, such as photography and poker, portraying them as evidence of her lack of communist values. Ultimately, she was branded the \"white-boned demon,\" a gendered caricature symbolising destruction and chaos.\nThe 1980 Gang of Four trial solidified Jiang's image as a manipulative and villainous figure. The indictment held the Gang responsible for the violence of the Cultural Revolution, accusing Jiang of using political purges for personal vendettas and fostering large-scale chaos. Widely broadcast both within and outside China, the trial reinforced a clear dichotomy: Jiang as a symbol of the past's chaos, and Deng Xiaoping's administration as the harbinger of order and progress. This narrative was consistent with the CCP's Resolution on History, which sought to redefine Mao Zedong's legacy. While Mao was criticised for \"errors,\" he was not held directly accountable for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution. Instead, full blame was shifted to Jiang and the Gang of Four, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to remain ideologically valid under Deng's reforms.\nAlternative views.\nBiographical literature on Jiang Qing has emerged as a tool to critique and reinterpret official Chinese historiography. These works challenge the one-dimensional vilification of Jiang, contributing to broader historical debates about the Cultural Revolution and its impact on shaping modern China. While factual biographies aim to deliver an accurate portrayal of their subject, fictional works take creative liberties, reimagining the life of a historical figure without strict adherence to facts. By rejecting the traditional authoritative biographical model\u2014which presents a subject's life as a coherent narrative\u2014works such as \"Jiang Qing and Her Husbands\" and \"Becoming Madame Mao\" instead question the validity of totalising narratives about Jiang. Ultimately, the private sphere in these narratives is used not to provide more intimate insights into the subject but as a means to deconstruct and challenge official Chinese historiography.\nComparisons.\nThe 2013 trial of Bo Xilai was regarded as the most dramatic courtroom event in China since Jiang Qing's trial in 1980. Bo's wife, Gu Kailai, was frequently likened to Jiang Qing due to the nature of her crimes. In 2024, \"Yomiuri Shimbun\" reported on Peng Liyuan's influence over key personnel decisions within the CCP. The report highlighted her backing of Dong Jun's appointment as Minister of Defence and Li Ganjie's selection as head of the CCP Organisation Department. Dong and Li were both from Shandong, where Peng was born. The report drew parallels between Xi Jinping's leadership in his later years and Mao Zedong's, likening Peng to Jiang Qing.\nMemorials.\nJiang Qing's grave remained undisclosed to the public until early 2009. Each year during the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, flower baskets are placed at Jiang's tomb. In 2015, leftist activists attempting to pay their respects faced resistance from dozens of security guards, with several taken to Pingguoyuan Police Station for questioning. Frustrated Maoist supporters questioned why publicly honouring Chiang Kai-shek was permitted while commemorating Jiang Qing was not, asking if the Republic of China had somehow reclaimed the mainland. Since 2018, such commemorations have proceeded without police interference. On 14 May 2021, leftist activists held a panel discussion on \"the Role of Li Jin in the History of the Party\", which Li Na reportedly attended. Since 2021, as large numbers of visitors continued to honour Jiang Qing, international media noted that authorities allowed leftist groups to commemorate her while prohibiting public mourning for Zhao Ziyang. Following this, the authorities banned public mourning for her at her gravesite, with surveillance cameras and security guards constantly monitoring the situation.\nPeking Opera.\nDuring the production of yangbanxi, Jiang had shown keen intuition, due to her experience as an actress, in showing the shape yangbanxi should take. However, Jiang's directions on opera reforms were often vague. Yu, acting as the pawn of Jiang, was able to manifest Jiang's orders into technical details that can be followed by the performers. Despite Yu's growing influence, he was never able to defy Jiang's orders, as he could only influence her thinking.\nJiang identified the weakness of Beijing opera as the lack of well organised music, which according to Jiang, \"builds the image of the characters.\" This conception was influenced by Yu's writing on the functional conception of music. Yu focused on reforming the language of music. This was due to Yu's belief that for yangbanxi to become successful in educating the masses on the structure and benefits of the new socialist state, the language of the music must be understandable to the common person. He first recommended that the lyrics be written in Mandarin, which was in line with the Chinese government policy that mandated the use of Mandarin as the language of instruction in schools nationwide. Yu also advocated that \"the melody should be composed in such a way that it also shadowed the syllabic tonal patterns\", which \"should sound natural to the ear as well as being easily understandable to the listener.\"\nAccording to Jiang's theory of the \"three prominences,\" the model revolutionary works were to foreground the principal hero over other heroic characters and positive characters over other characters. Jiang criticised spy thrillers (which were known as counterespionage films) for making the antagonists seem too intriguing. Jiang was known to be blunt in directing the yangbanxi, but Yu was able to serve as the mediator between Jiang and the performers. Since Jiang could not communicate her vision clearly, performers often take her criticisms as personal insults. Du Mingxin, one of Jiang's composers, recalled Jiang dismissed his music in the ballet \"The Red Detachment of Women\" (Hong Se Niang Zi Jun) as \"erotic ballad that used to be performed in the 1930s Shanghai nightclubs\". Du was then criticised for trying to destroy the yangbanxi project by hiding bourgeois music in a revolutionary ballet. Du felt humiliated by this remark. It was until Yu asked the group to submit another composition that Du regained his motivation and composed the now famous Wanquan Heshui (On Wanquan River). According to Du, this incident revealed Yu's artistic integrity, personal courage, and the ability to gain Jiang's acknowledgement on his decisions.\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nIn Mao Zedong's later years, he frequently refused to meet Jiang Qing. The two lived apart\u2014Mao resided in Zhongnanhai, while Jiang stayed at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse\u2014and rarely saw each other. Mao often criticised Jiang Qing and noted in his written comments that \"Jiang Qing does not represent me; she represents herself.\" He once confided to Wang Hairong and Tang Wensheng that Jiang aspired to become the Party Chair. During his interactions with Jiang Qing, Mao advised her to improve her relationships with colleagues who held differing opinions, rather than her small group. He also expressed frustration that she did not study the works of Marx, Lenin, or his own writings. Mao voiced concerns about Jiang Qing's future after his death, fearing that she might face troubles.\nShe had a daughter with Mao Zedong, which was Li Na. Li Na visited her frequently at Qincheng Prison, but they often quarrelled with each other for the husband of Li Na, Wang Jingqing, who once served the Central Security Regiment.\nHobbies.\nJiang's hobbies included photography, playing cards, and holding screenings of classic Hollywood films, especially those featuring Greta Garbo, one of her favorite actresses, even as they were banned for the average Chinese citizen as a symbol of bourgeois decadence. Jiang Qing was able to imitate Mao Zedong's handwriting. Her calligraphy was so similar to Mao's that some of her works were even displayed as Mao Zedong's manuscripts\nSince 1961, Jiang Qing, under the pen names Li Yunhe and Li Jin, had multiple landscape photographs selected for four consecutive National Photography Exhibitions. She became one of the photographers with the most works featured in each exhibition. In terms of lighting techniques, Jiang favoured backlighting and side-backlighting. Her visual style, which emphasised grandeur and completeness, had a significant influence on the photography community in mainland China.\nNotes.\nExplanatory notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nTranslation notes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65379", "revid": "28365693", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65379", "title": "The Day of the Triffids", "text": "1951 novel by John Wyndham\nThe Day of the Triffids is a 1951 post-apocalyptic novel by the English science fiction author John Wyndham. After most people in the world are blinded by an apparent meteor shower, an aggressive species of plant starts killing people. Although Wyndham had already published other novels using other pen name combinations drawn from his real name, this was the first novel published as \"John Wyndham\".\nThe story has been made into the 1963 feature film of the same name, three radio drama series (in 1957, 1968 and 2001) and two TV series (in 1981 and 2009). It was nominated for the International Fantasy Award in 1952, and in 2003 the novel was listed on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\nIt is the inspiration for the 2002 film \"28 Days Later\". In 2021, the novel was one of six classic science fiction novels by British authors selected by the Royal Mail to feature in a series of UK postage stamps.\nSummary.\nThe protagonist is Bill Masen, a biologist who has made his living working with triffids\u2014tall, venomous, carnivorous plants capable of locomotion. Due to his background, Bill suspects they were bioengineered in the Soviet Union and accidentally released into the wild. Because of the excellent industrial quality of an oil produced by and obtained from the triffids, there is heavy triffid cultivation around the world.\nThe narrative begins with Bill in hospital, his eyes bandaged after having been splashed with triffid poison from a stinger. During his recovery he is told of an unexpected green meteor shower. The next morning, he learns that the light from the unusual display has rendered any who watched it blind (later in the book, Bill speculates that the \"meteor shower\" may have been orbiting satellite weapons, triggered accidentally). After unbandaging his eyes he finds the hospital in chaos, with staff and patients without sight. He wanders through a chaotic London full of blind inhabitants and meets wealthy novelist Josella Playton, whom he rescues after discovering her being forcibly used as a guide by a blind man. Intrigued by a single light on top of the Senate House in an otherwise darkened city, Bill and Josella discover a group of sighted survivors led by a man named Beadley, who plans to establish a colony in the countryside. They decide to join the group.\nThe polygamy implicit in Beadley's scheme for rebuilding society appalls some group members, especially the religious Miss Durrant. However, before these plans can be put in place, a man named Wilfred Coker stages a fire at the university and kidnaps a number of sighted individuals, including Bill and Josella. They are each chained to a blind person and assigned to lead a squadron of the blind, collecting food and other supplies, all the while beset by escaped triffids and rival scavengers.\nSoon Bill's followers begin to fall sick and die of an unknown disease. When he wakes one morning to find the survivors have left him, he returns to the Senate House to seek Josella but his only lead is an address left behind by Beadley's group. Joined by a repentant Coker, Bill drives to the address, a country estate called Tynsham in Wiltshire. He finds part of the Beadley group, now led by Durrant, who eventually tells him that Beadley went to Dorset a few days before he arrived; there has been no sign of Josella. Bill and Coker decide to follow Beadley, finding small groups of blind and sighted people along the way. Eventually they decide to separate, Coker returning to help at Tynsham, while Bill heads for the Sussex Downs after remembering a remark Josella made about friends she had there.\nEn route, Bill rescues a young sighted girl named Susan, whom he finds trapped alone at home, while her young brother lies dead in the garden, killed by a triffid. He buries the boy and takes Susan with him. A few days later, during a night of heavy rain, they see a faint light in the distance. Upon reaching it, they discover Josella and her friends.\nThe survivors attempt to establish a self-sufficient colony in Sussex with some success but are constantly under threat from the triffids, which mass around the fenced exterior. Several years pass, until one day a representative of Beadley's faction lands a helicopter in their yard and reports that his group has established a colony on the Isle of Wight. Durrant's talk of Dorset was a deliberate attempt to throw Bill off on his journey to find Beadley. While Bill and the others are reluctant to leave their own settlement, the group decide to see the summer out in Sussex before moving to the Isle of Wight.\nTheir plans are hurried by the arrival of an armoured car of the militaristic representatives of a self-appointed, despotic government. Bill recognises the leader as a ruthless young man he had encountered on a scavenging expedition in London, whom he had watched cold-bloodedly execute one of his own group who had fallen ill. The latter plans to give Bill a large number of blind people to care for and use on the farm as slave labour; he will also take Susan as hostage. Feigning agreement, Bill's group throw a party, during which they encourage the visitors to get drunk. Creeping out of the house whilst the visitors are fast asleep, they disable the armoured car by pouring honey into the fuel tank and drive through the gates, leaving them open for the triffids to pour in. The novel ends with Bill's group on the Isle of Wight, determined one day to destroy the triffids and reclaim their world.\nPublication history.\nIn the United States, Doubleday &amp; Company holds the 1951 copyright. A condensed version of the book also was serialized in \"Collier's\" magazine in January and February 1951. An unabridged paperback edition was published in the late 1960s, in arrangement with Doubleday, under the Crest Book imprint of Fawcett Publications World Library.\nInfluences.\nWyndham frequently acknowledged the influence of H. G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\" (1897) on \"The Day of the Triffids\"\u2014 Wells's working title had been \"The Day of the Tripods\".\nThe triffids are related, in some editions of the novel, to brief mention of the theories of the Soviet agronomist Trofim Lysenko, a proponent of Lamarckism who eventually was thoroughly debunked. \"In the days when information was still exchanged Russia had reported some successes. Later, however, a cleavage of methods and views had caused biology there, under a man called Lysenko, to take a different course\" (Chapter 2). Lysenkoism at the time of the novel's creation was still being defended by some prominent international Stalinists.\nDuring the Blitz, Wyndham was a fire watcher and later member of the Home Guard. He witnessed the destruction of London from the rooftops of Bloomsbury. He described many scenes and incidents, including the uncanny silence of London on a Sunday morning after a heavy bombardment, in letters to his long-term partner Grace Wilson. These found their way into \"The Day of the Triffids\".\nCritical reception.\nThe book has been praised by other science fiction writers. Karl Edward Wagner cited \"The Day of the Triffids\" as one of the thirteen best science fiction horror novels. Arthur C. Clarke called it an \"immortal story\". Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised it, saying: \"rarely have the details of [the] collapse been treated with such detailed plausibility and human immediacy, and never has the collapse been attributed to such an unusual and terrifying source\". Forrest J. Ackerman wrote in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" that \"Triffids\" \"is extraordinarily well carried out, with the exception of a somewhat anticlimactic if perhaps inevitable conclusion\".\nBrian Aldiss coined the disparaging phrase cosy catastrophe to describe the subgenre of post-war apocalyptic fiction in which society is destroyed save for a handful of survivors, who are able to enjoy a relatively comfortable existence. He singled out \"The Day of the Triffids\" as an example and described \"Triffids\" as \"totally devoid of ideas\". However, some more recent critics have argued against this view. Margaret Atwood wrote: \"one might as well call World War II\u2014of which Wyndham was a veteran\u2014a 'cozy' war because not everyone died in it\".\nJohn Clute commented that the book was regularly chosen for school syllabuses, as it was \"safe\". Robert M. Philmus called it derivative of better books by H. G. Wells. Groff Conklin, reviewing the novel's first publication, characterised it as \"a good run-of-the-mill affair\" and \"pleasant reading... provided you aren't out hunting science fiction masterpieces\".\nCultural impact.\nAccording to director Danny Boyle, the opening hospital sequence of \"The Day of the Triffids\" inspired Alex Garland to write the screenplay for \"28 Days Later\" (2002).\nThe 2012 short story \"How to Make a Triffid\" by Kelly Lagor includes discussions of the possible genetic pathways that could be manipulated to engineer the triffids.\nThemes.\nScience and technology.\n\"The Day of the Triffids\" touches on mankind's advances in science and technology as a possible contributor to the collapse of society that's depicted in the novel.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;I saw them now with a disgust that they had never roused in me before. Horrible alien things which some of us had somehow created, and which the rest of us, in our careless greed, had cultured all over the world, One could not even blame nature for them.\u2014\u200aBill Masen, in \nIn a master's thesis entitled \"Social Critique in the Major Novels of John Wyndham: Civilization's Secrets and Nature's Truths\", Michael Douglas Green writes about other scientific contributions to the novel's apocalypse:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The apocalypse in \"The Day of the Triffids\" is not merely a result of the creation of the triffids, however. It is instead, a sort of compound disaster; the triffids only gain free rein after another man-made horror\u2014a satellite\u2014goes awry. The narrator describes the advent of a sort of orbital missile (not utterly unlike an ICBM) developed in both the East and West carrying not only atomic weapons but also \"such things as crop diseases, cattle diseases, radioactive dusts, viruses, and infections not only of familiar kinds, but brand-new sorts recently thought up in laboratories, all floating around up there.\"\u2014\u200a\nPost-WWII British politics.\nCritics have highlighted the parallels between the triffids and the decolonization that took place in Europe after 1945. In an essay entitled \"The Politics of Post-Apocalypse: Ideologies on Trial in John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\"\", literary critic Jerry M\u00e4\u00e4tt\u00e4 writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;It could be argued that one of the reasons why John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\" reached such a vast audience is that it can be read as a symbolic negotiation of the British situation in the first few years after the Second World War. Elsewhere, I have also suggested that the curiously under-analysed triffids could be read as distorted metaphors for the colonised peoples of the British Empire\u2014then in the middle of the process of decolonisation\u2014coming back to haunt mainland Britain, much as the Martians did in H. G. Wells' \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898), one of Wyndham's main influences.\u2014\u200a\nRobert Yeates, in his essay \"Gender and Ethnicity in Post-Apocalyptic Suburbia\", proposes another connection to colonialism:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The title \"The Day of the Triffids\" shows a colonial role reversal of this kind in which humanity is no longer the most powerful species, and Masen remarks that it is \"an unnatural thought that one type of creature should dominate perpetually.\"\u2014\u200a\nAt the time of the novel's writing there was an emerging welfare state in Great Britain after the formation of the Attlee ministry. Coker's forced shackling of sighted people to the blind echoes the sentiments that some middle-class British citizens felt in the wake of the changes introduced by the Labour party after their 1945 election victory.\nLoss of identity.\nThe novel frequently brings into question the utility of individualism during the apocalypse. Colin Manlove highlights this phenomenon in his essay \"Everything Slipping Away: John Wyndham's \"The Day of the Triffids\"\":\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Simultaneous with this process, people lose their identities. Part of this comes from the fact that all now exist in a shared situation, the catastrophe: no longer can one be an agronomist, a doctor, a farmer, a novelist, but only one more individual up against the triffids, one only real distinction being if one is sighted.\nSequels.\nSimon Clark wrote a sequel \"The Night of the Triffids\" (2001). This is set 25 years after Wyndham's book, and focuses on the adventures of Bill Masen's son David, who travels to New York. Big Finish Productions adapted it as an audio play in 2014. The dramatisation featuring Sam Troughton was later broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra in June 2016.\nSimon Gould published \"The Land of the Triffids\" in 2016, continuing the story of Christina Schofield, picking up where Simon Clark's \"The Night of the Triffids\" left off. However, as of 2023[ [update]], the book is unavailable for purchase and has not been dramatised in any form.\nIn 2020, English science fiction and fantasy author John Whitbourn published a sequel, entitled \"The Age of the Triffids\". Set in the Isle of Wight \"Colony\" in the lead-up to the Millennium, it details the rallying of survivors from across Britain for one last attempt to defeat the triffid threat. For copyright reasons, the book is not for sale outside Canada and New Zealand.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

They may have been related to the Mainland Caribs (Kalina) of South America, but they spoke an unrelated language known as Kalinago or Island Carib. They also spoke a pidgin language associated with the Mainland Caribs.\nAt the time of Spanish contact, the Kalinago were one of the dominant groups in the Caribbean (the name of which is derived from \"Carib\", as the Kalinago were once called). They lived throughout north-eastern South America, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, the Windward Islands, Dominica, and possibly the southern Leeward Islands. Historically, it was thought their ancestors were mainland peoples who had conquered the islands from their previous inhabitants, the Igneri. However, linguistic and archaeological evidence contradicts the notion of a mass emigration and conquest; the Kalinago language appears not to have been Cariban, but like that of their neighbors, the Ta\u00edno. Irving Rouse and others suggest that a smaller group of mainland peoples migrated to the islands without displacing their inhabitants, eventually adopting the local language but retaining their traditions of a South American origin.\nRecent archaeological research in Grenada has further refined this understanding, suggesting that the \"Island Caribs\" of the historic period may have been composed of two distinct groups: the \"Cara\u00efbe\" (likely the long-term indigenous inhabitants who produced Suazan Troumassoid pottery) and the \"Galibis\" (newer arrivals from the mainland who produced Cayo pottery).\nIn the early colonial period, the Kalinago had a reputation as warriors who raided neighboring islands. According to the tales of Spanish conquistadors, the Kalinago were cannibals who regularly ate roasted human flesh. (This is where the word cannibal comes from.) There is no hard evidence of Caribs eating human flesh, though one historian points out it might have been seldomly done as means of taunting or even frightening their Arawak enemies. The Kalinago and their descendants continue to live in the Antilles, notably on the island of Dominica. The Garifuna, who share common ancestry with the Kalinago, also live principally in Central America.\nName.\nThe exonym \"Caribe\" was first recorded by Christopher Columbus. One hypothesis for the origin of \"Carib\" is that it means \"brave warrior\". Its variants, including the English word \"Carib\", were then adopted by other European languages. Early Spanish explorers and administrators used the terms \"Arawak\" and \"Caribs\" to distinguish the peoples of the Caribbean, with \"Carib\" reserved for Indigenous groups that they considered hostile and \"Arawak\" for groups that they considered friendly.\nThe Kalinago language endonyms are \"Karifuna\" (singular) and \"Kalinago\" (plural). The name was officially changed from 'Carib' to 'Kalinago' in Dominica in 2015.\nHistory.\nWilliam F. Keegan and Corinne L. Hofman have outlined two major models for the origin of the Kalinago. The traditional account, which is almost as old as Columbus, says that the Caribs were a warlike people who were moving up the Lesser Antilles and displacing the original inhabitants. Early missionary texts suggested the original inhabitants of the islands were the Igneri, while the Kalinago were invaders originating in South America (home to the mainland Caribs or Kalina) who conquered and displaced the Igneri. As this tradition was widespread in oral testimonies, and internally consistent, it was accepted as historical by Europeans.\nThe second model proposes that the Kalinago developed out of the indigenous peoples of the Antilles. While the Caribs were commonly believed to have migrated from the Orinoco River area in South America to settle in the Caribbean islands about 1200 CE, an analysis of ancient DNA suggests that the Caribs had a common origin with contemporary groups in the Greater and Lesser Antilles. The transition from Igneri to Island Carib culture may have occurred around 1450.\nRecent evidence from the southern Windward Islands supports a model of integration rather than displacement. In 1649, the French in Grenada distinguished between two groups: \"Cara\u00efbes\" and \"Galibis.\" Archaeological findings link the \"Cara\u00efbes\" to the indigenous Suazan Troumassoid pottery tradition (developed *in situ* from earlier Saladoid populations) and the \"Galibis\" to the Cayo pottery tradition (derived from the mainland Koriabo complex). This suggests that the historic \"Kalinago\" or \"Island Carib\" identity was a political alliance or fusion of these two distinct groups, rather than a monolithic invasion.\nArchaeological Evidence.\nArchaeological evidence in support of the invasion model is sparse, with \"no confirmed Carib sites [known] prior to the 1990s.\" However, Cayo-style pottery found in the Lesser Antilles, and dated between 1000 and 1500, is similar to the Koriabo complex from which the mainland Carib or Kari'na pottery tradition is descended. Cayo pottery was once thought to have preceded Suazoid pottery (associated with the Igneri) in the Lesser Antilles, but more recent scholarship suggests that Cayo pottery gradually replaced Suazoid pottery in the islands. Cayo-style pottery has been found in the Lesser Antilles from Grenada to Basse-Terre, and, possibly, Saint Kitts. Cayo pottery also shows similarities to the Meillacoid and Chicoid styles of the Greater Antilles, as well as to the South American Koriabo style.\nIn Grenada and St. Vincent, radiocarbon dating indicates that Cayo pottery arrived around AD 1250, co-occurring with Suazan Troumassoid pottery until the historic period. The shift to the \"Troumassan\" and later \"Suazan\" ceramic styles (often associated with the rise of \"Carib\" culture) occurred during a period of regional drought (c. AD 730\u2013900). Contrary to expectations of collapse, populations in the southern Windwards expanded during this time, likely due to an influx of Arauquinoid migrants from the mainland who integrated with local populations. This influx likely contributed to the development of the Suazan tradition, which persisted until European contact. Furthermore, settlement pattern analysis using the Ideal Free Distribution model suggests that northern islands were settled earlier than southern ones like Grenada, supporting a \"Southward Route\" hypothesis for the initial colonization of the Antilles, and contradicting the idea of the Windward Islands being the primary \"stepping stones\" from South America.\nArrival of Columbus.\nUpon his arrival in the Caribbean archipelago in 1492, the Maipurean-speaking Ta\u00ednos reportedly told Christopher Columbus that Caribs were fierce warriors and cannibals, who made frequent raids on the Ta\u00ednos, often capturing women. According to Columbus, the Ta\u00ednos said the Caribs had spent the last two centuries displacing the Ta\u00ednos by warfare, extermination, and assimilation.\nThe French missionary Raymond Breton arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, and lived in Guadeloupe and Dominica until 1653. He took ethnographic and linguistic notes on the native peoples of these islands, including St. Vincent, which he visited briefly. Breton was responsible for many of the early stereotypes about Kalinago.\nLater, the Kalinago occasionally allied with the Ta\u00ednos to repel European invaders. When the Spanish attempted to colonize Puerto Rico, Kalinago from St. Croix arrived to aid the local Ta\u00edno. Daguao village, initially slated to be the Europeans' new capital, was destroyed by Ta\u00ednos from the eastern area of Puerto Rico, with the support of Kalinago from neighboring Vieques. By the middle of the 16th century, the resistance of Ta\u00ednos and Kalinago alike was largely quashed across the Greater Antilles. The survivors were enslaved to work in agriculture or mining.\nThe Kalinagos were more successful in repelling the Spanish\u2014and later the French and English\u2014in the Lesser Antilles, retaining their independence. The lack of gold in the area and the large numbers of casualties inflicted upon the Spanish contributed to their survival.\nResistance to the English and the French.\nIn the seventeenth century, the Kalinago regularly attacked the plantations of the English and the French in the Leeward Islands. In the 1630s, planters from the Leewards conducted campaigns against the Kalinago, but with limited success. The Kalinago took advantage of divisions between the Europeans, to provide support to the French and the Dutch during wars in the 1650s, consolidating their independence as a result. Such wars led to a geopolitical boundary separating the Lesser Antilles, inhabited by the Kalinago, from the Greater Antilles, inhabited by the Ta\u00edno. This boundary became known as the \"poison arrow curtain\".\nIn 1660, France and England signed the \"Treaty of Saint Charles\" with Island Caribs. It stipulated that the Kalinago would evacuate all the Lesser Antilles except for Dominica and Saint Vincent, which were recognised as reserves. However, the English later ignored the treaty, and pursue a campaign against the Kalinago in succeeding decades. Between the 1660s and 1700, the English waged an intermittent campaign against the Kalinago.\nBy 1763, the British had annexed St Lucia, Tobago, Dominica and St Vincent. On Saint Vincent the Kalinago intermarried with Free West African Captives willingly, forming the 'Black Caribs' or Garifuna who were expelled to Honduras in 1797. The British colonial use of the term \"Black Carib\", particularly in William Young's \"Account of the Black Charaibs\" (1795), has been described in modern historiography as framing the majority of the indigenous St. Vincent population as \"mere interlopers from Africa\" who lacked claims to land possession in St. Vincent. Despite the Garifuna culture and language is entirely indigenous influenced.\nKalinago people today.\nAs of 2008[ [update]], a small population of around 3,400 Kalinago survived in the Kalinago Territory in northeast Dominica, of whom some 70 \"defined themselves as 'pure'\". The Kalinago of Dominica maintained their independence for many years by taking advantage of the island's rugged terrain. The island's east coast includes a territory formerly known as the Carib Territory that was granted to the people by the British government in 1903. The Dominican Kalinago elect their own chief. In July 2003, the Kalinago observed 100 Years of Territory, and in July 2014, Charles Williams was elected Kalinago Chief, succeeding Chief Garnette Joseph.\nDuring the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Island Carib population in St. Vincent was greater than that in Dominica. Both the Island Caribs (Yellow Caribs) and the Black Caribs (Garifuna) fought against the British during the Second Carib War. After the end of the war, the British deported the Garifuna (a population of 4,338) to Roatan Island, while the Island Caribs (whose population consisted of 80 people) were allowed to stay on St. Vincent. The 1812 eruption of La Soufri\u00e8re destroyed the Carib territory, killing a majority of the Yellow Caribs. After the eruption, 130 Yellow Caribs and 59 Black Caribs survived on St. Vincent. Unable to recover from the damage caused by the eruption, 120 of the Yellow Caribs, under Captain Baptiste, emigrated to Trinidad. In 1830, the Carib population numbered less than 100.\nCulture and society.\nCanoes.\nCanoes are a significant aspect of the Kalinago's material culture and economy. They are used for transport from the southern continent and islands of the Caribbean, as well as providing them with the ability to fish more efficiently and to grow their fishing industry. Canoes, constructed from the Burseraceae, \"Cedrela odorata\", \"Ceiba pentandra\", and \"Hymenaea courbaril\" trees, serve different purposes depending on their height and thickness of the bark. The \"Ceiba pentandra\" tree is not only functional but spiritual and believed to house spirits that would become angered if disturbed. Canoes have been used throughout the history of the Kalinago and have become a renewed interest within the manufacturing of traditional dugout canoes used for inter-island transportation and fishing.\nIn 1997 Dominica Carib artist Jacob Frederick and Tortola artist Aragorn Dick Read set out to build a traditional canoe based on the fishing canoes still used in Dominica, Guadeloupe and Martinique. They launched a voyage by canoe to the Orinoco delta to meet up with the local Kalinago tribes, re-establishing cultural connections with the remaining Kalinago communities along the island chain, documented by the BBC in \"The Quest of the Carib Canoe\".\nLanguage.\nHistorically, scholars assumed that Island Carib men and women spoke different languages. To explain this phenomenon, scholars proposed that the Island Caribs may have killed the men and kept the women, allowing the Igneri language to survive among women. This assumption arose from the fact that by at least the early 17th century, Carib men spoke a Cariban-based pidgin language in addition to the usual Arawakan language used by both sexes. This was similar to pidgins used by mainland Caribs when communicating with their Arawak neighbors. Berend J. Hoff and Douglas Taylor hypothesized that it dated to the time of the Carib expansion through the islands, and that males maintained it to emphasize their origins on the mainland.\nLinguistic analysis in the 20th century determined that the main Island Carib language was spoken by both sexes, and was Arawakan, not Cariban. Scholars adopted more nuanced theories to explain the transition from the earlier Igneri to the later Island Carib societies in the Antilles. Irving Rouse proposed that a relatively small scale Carib force conquered but did not displace the Igneri, and the invaders eventually took on the Igneri language while still maintaining their identity as Caribs. Other scholars such as Sued Badillo doubt there was an invasion at all, proposing that the Igneri adopted the \"Carib\" identity over time due to their close economic and political relations with the rising mainland Carib polity. Both theories accept that the historical Island Carib language developed from the existing tongue of the islands, and thus it is also known as Igneri.\nMedicine.\nBy the early twenty-first century, a combination of bush medicine and modern medicine was used by the Kalinago of Dominica. For example, various fruits and leaves are used to heal common ailments. For a sprain, oils from coconuts, snakes, and bay leaves are used to heal the injury. Formerly the Caribs used an extensive range of medicinal plant and animal products.\nReligion.\nThe Caribs are believed to have practiced polytheism. As the Spanish began to colonise the Caribbean area, they wanted to convert the natives to Catholicism. The Caribs destroyed a church of Franciscans in Aguada, Puerto Rico and killed five of its members, in 1579.\nRepresentation.\nIn 1492, when Christopher Columbus arrived in the Caribbean, the Maipurean-speaking Ta\u00ednos reportedly relayed stories of the Caribs' war-like nature and cannibalism to him. When he arrived in the Lesser Antilles in 1635, the French missionary Raymond Breton made ethnographic and linguistic notes on the \"Caribs\", which also informed many of the early stereotypes about the Kalinago. Other missionaries, such as Cesar de Rochefort, would refute the common conception of the Caribs as cannibals.\nCannibalism.\nEarly European accounts describe the taking of human trophies and the ritual cannibalism of war captives among both Arawak and other Amerindian groups such as the Carib and Tupinamb\u00e1, though the exact accuracy of cannibalistic reports still remains debated without skeletal evidence to support it. Scholars such as Hilary McD. Beckles have instead suggested that the stories of \"vicious cannibals\" may have comprised an \"ideological campaign\" against the Kalinago to justify \"genocidal military expeditions\" by European colonizers.\nThe Island Carib word \"karibna\" meant \"person\", although it became the origin of the English word \"cannibal\" after Columbus shared stories of flesh-eating Kalinago, apparently heard from their historic Ta\u00edno enemies. Among the Caribs, \"karibna\" was apparently associated with ritual eating of war enemies.\nThe Caribs reportedly had a tradition of keeping bones of their ancestors in their houses. Missionaries, such as P\u00e8re Jean Baptiste Labat and Cesar de Rochefort, described the practice as part of a belief that the ancestral spirits would always look after the bones and protect their descendants. The Caribs have been described by their various enemies as vicious and violent raiders. Rochefort stated they did not practice cannibalism.\nDuring his third voyage to North America in 1528, after exploring Florida, the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles, Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano was killed and allegedly eaten by Carib natives on what is now Guadeloupe, near a place called \"Karukera\" (\"island of beautiful waters\"). Historian William Riviere has described most of the cannibalism as related to war rituals.\nCarib resistance.\nChief Kairouane and his men from Grenada jumped off the \"Leapers Hill\" rather than face slavery under the French invaders, serving as an iconic representation of the Kalinago spirit of resistance.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The term \"dime novel\" has been used as a catchall term for several different but related forms, referring to story papers, five- and ten-cent weeklies, \"thick book\" reprints, and sometimes early pulp magazines. Dime novels are similar in form and content to British penny dreadfuls and story papers, which were produced at the same time.\nThe term was used as a title as late as 1940, in the short-lived pulp magazine \"Western Dime Novels\". In the modern age, the term \"dime novel\" has been used to refer to quickly written, lurid potboilers, usually as a pejorative to describe a sensationalized but superficial literary work.\nHistory.\nIn 1860, the publishers Erastus and Irwin Beadle released a new series of cheap paperbacks, \"Beadle's Dime Novels\". \"Dime novel\" became a general term for similar paperbacks produced by various publishers in the early twentieth century. The first book in the Beadle series was \"Malaeska, the Indian Wife of the White Hunter\", by Ann S. Stephens, dated June 9, 1860. The novel was essentially a reprint of Stephens's earlier serial, which had appeared in the \"Ladies' Companion\" magazine in February, March and April 1839. It sold more than 65,000 copies in the first few months after its publication as a dime novel. Dime novels varied in size, even in the first Beadle series, but were mostly about , with 100 pages. The first 28 were published without a cover illustration, in a salmon-colored paper wrapper. A woodblock print was added in issue 29, and the first 28 were reprinted with illustrated covers. The books were priced, of course, at ten cents.\nThis series ran for 321 issues and established almost all the conventions of the genre, from the lurid and outlandish story to the melodramatic double titling used throughout the series, which ended in the 1920s. Most of the stories were frontier tales reprinted from the numerous serials in the story papers and other sources, but many were original stories.\nAs the popularity of dime novels increased, original stories came to be the norm. The books were reprinted many times, sometimes with different covers, and the stories were often further reprinted in different series and by different publishers.\nThe literacy rate increased around the time of the American Civil War, and \"Beadle's Dime Novels\" were immediately popular among young, working-class readers. By the end of the war, numerous competitors, such as George Munro and Robert DeWitt, were crowding the field, distinguishing their product only by title and the color of the paper wrappers. Beadle &amp; Adams had their own alternate \"brands\", such as the Frank Starr line. As a whole, the quality of the fiction was derided by highbrow critics, and the term \"dime novel\" came to refer to any form of cheap, sensational fiction, rather than the specific format.\nNonetheless, the pocket-sized sea, Western, railway, circus, gold-digger, and other adventures were an instant success. Author Armin Jaemmrich observes that Alexis de Tocqueville's thesis in \"Democracy in America\" (1835) says that in democratic and socially permeable societies, like that of the U.S., the lower classes were not \"naturally indifferent to science, literature, and the arts: only it must be acknowledged that they cultivate them after their own fashion, and bring to the task their own peculiar qualifications and deficiencies.\" He found that in aristocratic societies education and interest in literature were confined to a small upper class, and that the literary class would arrive at a \"sort of aristocratic jargon, ... hardly less remote from pure language than was the coarse dialect of the people.\" According to Tocqueville, due to the heterogeneity of its population, the situation in the U.S. was different, and people were asking for reading matter. Since, in his view, practically every American was busy earning a living with no time for obtaining a higher education let alone for timeconsuming distractions, they preferred books which \"may be easily procured, quickly read, and which require no learned researches to be understood ... they require rapid emotions, startling passages ... Small productions will be more common than bulky books ... The object of authors will be to astonish rather than to please, and to stir the passions more than to charm the taste.\" Written twenty-five years prior to the emergence of the dimes, his words read like an exact anticipation of their main characteristics.\nPrices.\nAdding to the general confusion as to what is or is not a dime novel, many of the series, though similar in design and subject, cost ten (a dime) to fifteen cents. Beadle &amp; Adams complicated the matter by issuing some titles in the same salmon-colored covers at different prices. Also, there were a number of ten-cent, paper-covered books of the period that featured medieval romance stories and melodramatic tales. This makes it hard to define what falls in the category of the dime novel, with classification depending on format, price, or style of material. Examples of dime novel series that illustrate the diversity of the form include \"Bunce's Ten Cent Novels\", \"Brady's Mercury Stories\", \"Beadle's Dime Novels\", Irwin P. Beadle's \"Ten Cent Stories\", \"Munro's Ten Cent Novels\", \"Dawley's Ten Penny Novels\", \"Fireside Series\", \"Chaney's Union Novels\",\" DeWitt's Ten Cent Romances\", \"Champion Novels\", \"Frank Starr's American Novels\", \"Ten Cent Novelettes\", \"Richmond's Sensation Novels\", and \"Ten Cent Irish Novels\".\nIn 1874, Beadle &amp; Adams added the novelty of color to the covers when their \"New Dime Novels\" series replaced the flagship title. The \"New Dime Novels\" were issued with a dual numbering system on the cover, one continuing the numbering from the first series and the second and more prominent one indicating the number in the current series; for example, the first issue was numbered 1 (322). The stories were mostly reprints from the first series. Like its predecessor, Beadle's \"New Dime Novels\" ran for 321 issues, until 1885.\nDevelopment.\nMuch of the content of dime novels came from story papers, which were weekly, eight-page newspaper-like publications, varying in size from tabloid to full-size newspaper format and usually costing five or six cents. They started in the mid-1850s and were immensely popular, some titles being issued for over fifty years on a weekly schedule. They are perhaps best described as the television of their day, containing a variety of serial stories and articles, with something aimed at each member of the family, and often illustrated profusely with woodcuts. Popular story papers included \"The Saturday Journal\", \"Young Men of America\", \"Golden Weekly\", \"Golden Hours\", \"Good News\", and \"Happy Days\".\nMost of the stories in dime novels stood alone, but in the late 1880s series characters began to appear and quickly grew in popularity. The original Frank Reade stories first appeared in \"Boys of New York\". The Old Sleuth, appearing in \"The Fireside Companion\" story paper beginning in 1872, was the first dime-novel detective and began the trend away from the western and frontier stories that dominated the story papers and dime novels up to that time. He was the first character to use the word \"sleuth\" to denote a detective, the word's original definition being that of a bloodhound trained to track. He is also responsible for the popularity of the use of the word \"old\" in the names of competing dime novel detectives, such as Old Cap Collier, Old Broadbrim, Old King Brady, Old Lightning, and Old Ferret, among many others. Nick Carter first appeared in 1886 in the \"New York Weekly\". Frank Reade, the Old Sleuth and Nick Carter had their own ten-cent weekly titles within a few years.\nChanging formats.\nIn 1873, the house of Beadle &amp; Adams introduced a new ten-cent format, , with only 32 pages and a black-and-white illustration on the cover, under the title \"New and Old Friends\". It was not a success, but the format was so much cheaper to produce that they tried again in 1877 with \"The Fireside Library\" and \"Frank Starr's New York Library\". The first reprinted English love stories, the second contained hardier material, but both titles caught on. Publishers were no less eager to follow a new trend then than now. Soon the newsstands were flooded by ten-cent weekly \"libraries\". These publications also varied in size, from as small as 7 x 10\u00a0inches (\"The Boy's Star Library\" is an example) to 8.5 x 12 (\"New York Detective Library\"). The \"Old Cap Collier Library\" was issued in both sizes and also in booklet form. Each issue tended to feature a single story, unlike the story papers, and many of them were devoted to a single character. Frontier stories, evolving into westerns, were still popular, but the new vogue tended to urban crime stories. One of the most successful titles, Frank Tousey's \"New York Detective Library\" eventually came to alternate stories of the James Gang with stories of Old King Brady, detective, and (in a rare occurrence in the dime novel) several stories which featured both, with Old King Brady doggedly on the trail of the vicious gang.\nThe competition was fierce, and publishers were always looking for an edge. Once again, color came into play when Frank Tousey introduced a weekly with brightly colored covers in 1896. Street &amp; Smith countered by issuing a weekly in a smaller format with muted colors. Such titles as \"New Nick Carter Weekly\" (continuing the original black-and-white \"Nick Carter Library\"), \"Tip-Top Weekly\" (introducing Frank Merriwell) and others were 7 x 10 inches with thirty-two pages of text, but the 8.5 x 11 Tousey format carried the day, and Street &amp; Smith soon followed suit. The price was also dropped to five cents, making the magazines more accessible to children. This would be the last major permutation of the product before it evolved into pulp magazines. Ironically, for many years it has been the nickel weeklies that most people refer to when using the term \"dime novel\".\nThe nickel weeklies were popular, and their numbers grew quickly. Frank Tousey and Street &amp; Smith dominated the field. Tousey had his \"big six\": \"Work and Win\" (featuring Fred Fearnot, a serious rival to the soon-to-be-popular Frank Merriwell), \"Secret Service\", \"Pluck and Luck\", \"Wild West Weekly\", \"Fame and Fortune Weekly\", and \"The Liberty Boys of '76\", each of which issued over a thousand copies weekly. Street &amp; Smith had \"New Nick Carter Weekly\", \"Tip Top Weekly\", \"Buffalo Bill Stories\", \"Jesse James Stories\", \"Brave &amp; Bold Weekly\" and many others. The Tousey stories were generally the more lurid and sensational of the two.\nPerhaps the most confusing of the various formats lumped together under the term \"dime novel\" are the so-called \"thick-book\" series, most of which were published by Street &amp; Smith, J. S. Ogilvie and Arthur Westbrook. These books were published in series, contained roughly 150 to 200 pages, and were , often with color covers on a higher-grade stock. They reprinted multiple stories from the five- and ten-cent weeklies, often slightly rewritten to tie them together.\nAll dime-novel publishers were canny about reusing and refashioning material, but Street &amp; Smith excelled at it. They developed the practice of publishing four consecutive, related tales of, for example, Nick Carter, in the weekly magazine, then combining the four stories into one edition of the related thick-book series, in this instance, the \"New Magnet Library\". The Frank Merriwell stories appeared in the \"Medal, New Medal\" and \"Merriwell\" libraries, Buffalo Bill in the \"Buffalo Bill Library\" and \"Far West Library\", and so on. The thick books were still in print as late as the 1930s but carry the copyright date of the original story, often as early as the late nineteenth century, leading some dealers and new collectors today to erroneously assume they have original dime novels when the books are only distantly related.\nDemise.\nIn 1896, Frank Munsey had converted his juvenile magazine \"Argosy\" into a fiction magazine for adults, the first of the pulp magazines. By the turn of the century, new high-speed printing techniques combined with cheaper pulp paper allowed him to drop the price from twenty-five cents to ten cents, and sales of the magazine took off. In 1910, Street and Smith converted two of their nickel weeklies, \"New Tip Top Weekly\" and \"Top Notch Magazine\", into pulps; in 1915, \"Nick Carter Stories\", itself a replacement for the \"New Nick Carter Weekly\", became \"Detective Story Magazine\", and in 1919, \"New Buffalo Bill Weekly\" became \"Western Story Magazine\". Harry Wolff, the successor in interest to the Frank Tousey titles, continued to reprint many of them into the mid-1920s, most notably \"Secret Service, Pluck and Luck, Fame and Fortune\" and \"Wild West Weekly\". These two series were purchased by Street &amp; Smith in 1926 and converted into pulp magazines the following year, effectively ending the era of the dime novel.\nCollections.\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, collecting dime novels became popular, and prices soared. Even at that time, the cheap publications were crumbling into dust and becoming hard to find. Two collectors, Charles Bragin and Ralph Cummings, issued a number of reprints of hard-to-find titles from some of the weekly libraries.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He studied music, history of literature, and philosophy in Buenos Aires. In 1957 he moved to Cologne, West Germany, where he lived until his death.\nAs teacher.\nFrom 1960 to 1966 and from 1972 to 1976 Kagel taught at the Darmst\u00e4dter Ferienkurse. He also taught from 1964\u201365 at the University at Buffalo as the visiting Slee Professor of music theory. At the Berlin Film and Television Academy he was a visiting lecturer. He served as director of courses for new music in Gothenburg and Cologne. He was professor for new music theatre at the K\u00f6ln Hochschule from 1974\u201397.\nAmong his students were Moya Henderson, Kevin Volans, Maria de Alvear, Carola Bauckholt, Branimir Krsti\u0107, David Sawer, Rickard Scheffer, Juan Maria Solare, Norma Tyer, Gerald Barry, Martyn Harry, and Chao-Ming Tung. \"See: .\"\nAs composer.\nSome of his pieces give specific theatrical instructions to the performers, such as to adopt certain facial expressions while playing, to make their stage entrances in a particular way, or to physically interact with other performers. For this reason commentators at times related his work to the theatre of the absurd. He has been regarded by music historians as deploying a critical intelligence interrogating the position of music in society. He was also active in the fields of film and photography. In 1991 Kagel was invited by Walter Fink to be the second composer featured in the annual Komponistenportr\u00e4t of the Rheingau Musik Festival. In 2000 he received the Ernst von Siemens Music Prize.\nMusic.\n\"Staatstheater\" (1970) remains, probably, Kagel's best-known work. He described it as a \"ballet for non-dancers\", although it is in many ways more like an opera; the devices it uses as musical instruments include chamber pots and enema equipment.\nSimilar is the radio play \"Ein Aufnahmezustand\" (1969) which is about the incidents surrounding the recording of a radio play. In \"Con voce\" (With Voice), a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. \"Match\" (1964) is a \"tennis game\" for cellists with a percussionist as umpire, also the subject of one of Kagel's films and perhaps the best-known of his works of instrumental theatre.\nKagel also wrote a large number of more conventional orchestral and chamber pieces. Many of these make references to music of the past by, among others, Beethoven, Brahms, Bach and Liszt.\nFilms.\nKagel also made films, with one of the best known being \"Ludwig van\" (1970), a critical interrogation of the uses of Beethoven's music made during the bicentenary of that composer's birth. In it, a reproduction of Beethoven's studio is seen, as part of a fictive visit of the Beethoven House in Bonn. Everything in it is papered with sheet music of Beethoven's pieces. The soundtrack of the film is a piano playing the music as it appears in each shot. Because the music has been wrapped around curves and edges, it is somewhat distorted, but Beethovenian motifs can still be heard. In other parts, the film contains parodies of radio or TV broadcasts connected with the \"Beethoven Year 1770\". Kagel later turned the film into a piece of sheet music itself which could be performed in a concert without the film\u2014the score consists of close-ups of various areas of the studio, which are to be interpreted by the performing pianist.\nReferences.\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65406", "revid": "47885085", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65406", "title": "Sumerian King List", "text": "Ancient text listing Sumerian Kingships\nThe Sumerian King List (abbreviated SKL) or Chronicle of the One Monarchy is an ancient literary composition written in Sumerian that was likely created and redacted to legitimize the claims to power of various city-states and kingdoms in southern Mesopotamia during the late third and early second millennium BC. It does so by repetitively listing Sumerian cities, the kings that ruled there, and the lengths of their reigns. Especially in the early part of the list, these reigns often span thousands of years. In the oldest known version, dated to the Ur III period (c.\u20092112\u00a0\u2013 c.\u20092004 BC) but probably based on Akkadian source material, the \"SKL\" reflected a more linear transition of power from Kish, the first city to receive kingship, to Akkad. In later versions from the Old Babylonian period, the list consisted of a large number of cities between which kingship was transferred, reflecting a more cyclical view of how kingship came to a city, only to be inevitably replaced by the next. In its best-known and best-preserved version, as recorded on the Weld-Blundell Prism, the \"SKL\" begins with a number of fictional antediluvian kings, who ruled before a flood swept over the land, after which kingship went to Kish. It ends with a dynasty from Isin (early second millennium BC), which is well-known from other contemporary sources.\nThe \"SKL\" is preserved in several versions, the first fragment of which was published in 1906 by Hermann Volrath Hilprecht, and the second in 1911 by Jean-Vincent Scheil. Most of these date to the Old Babylonian period, but the oldest version of the SKL dates back to the Ur III period. The clay tablets on which the \"SKL\" was recorded were generally found on sites in southern Mesopotamia. These versions differ in their exact content; some sections are missing, others are arranged in a different order, names of kings may be absent or the lengths of their reigns may vary. These differences are both the result of copying errors, and of deliberate editorial decisions to change the text to fit current needs.\nIn the past, the \"Sumerian King List\" was considered as an invaluable source for the reconstruction of the political history of Early Dynastic Mesopotamia. More recent research has indicated that the use of the \"SKL\" is fraught with difficulties, and that it should only be used with caution, if at all, in the study of ancient Mesopotamia during the third and early second millennium BC.\nNaming conventions.\nThe text is best known under its modern name \"Sumerian King List\", which is often abbreviated to \"SKL\" in scholarly literature. A less-used name is the \"Chronicle of the One Monarchy\", reflecting the notion that, according to this text, there could ever be only one city exercising kingship over Mesopotamia. In contemporary sources, the \"SKL\" was called after its first word: \"nam-lugal\", or \"kingship\". It should also be noted that what is commonly referred to as the \"Sumerian King List\", is in reality not a single text. Rather, it is a literary composition of which different versions existed through time in which sections were missing, arranged in a different order, and names, reigns and details on kings were different or absent.\nModern scholarship has used numbered dynasties to refer to the uninterrupted rule of a single city; hence the Ur III dynasty denotes the third time that the city of Ur assumed hegemony over Mesopotamia according to the \"SKL\". This numbering (e.g. Kish I, Uruk IV, Ur III) is not present in the original text. It should also be noted that the modern usage of the term dynasty, i.e. a sequence of rulers from a single family, does not necessarily apply to ancient Mesopotamia. Even though the \"SKL\" points out that some rulers were family, it was the city, rather than individual rulers, to which kingship was given.\nSources.\nThe \"Sumerian King List\" is known from a number of different sources, all in the form of clay tablets or cylinders and written in Sumerian. At least 16 different tablets or fragments containing parts of the composition are known. Some tablets are unprovenanced, but most have been recovered, or are known to have come from various sites across Mesopotamia, the majority coming from Nippur. So far a version of the \"SKL\" has been found outside of Babylonia only twice. One copy was found at Susa in Elam. The other, found at Tell Leilan in Upper Mesopotamia, contains the only clean copy of the Mari list which is badly broken in other recensions.\nThere is only one manuscript that contains a relatively undamaged version of the composition. This is the Weld-Blundell Prism which includes the antediluvian part of the composition and ends with the Isin dynasty. Other manuscripts are incomplete because they are damaged or fragmentary. The Scheil dynastic tablet, from Susa, for example, only contains parts of the composition running from Uruk II to Ur III. Given the state of the SKL sources literary compositions like the Tummal Chronicle and the Ballad of the Early Rulers are used as input as well.\nThe majority of the sources are dated to the Old Babylonian period (early second millennium BC), and more specifically the early part of that era. In many cases, a more precise dating is not possible, but in one case, the Weld-Blundell prism, it could be dated to year 11 of the reign of king Sin-Magir of Isin, the last ruler to be mentioned in the \"Sumerian King List\". The so-called \"Ur III Sumerian King List\" (\"USKL\"), on a clay tablet possibly found in Adab, is the only known version of the \"SKL\" that predates the Old Babylonian period. The colophon of this text mentions that it was copied during the reign of Shulgi (2084\u20132037 BC), the second king of the Ur III dynasty. The \"USKL\" is especially interesting because its pre-Sargonic part is completely different from that of the \"SKL\". Whereas the \"SKL\" records many different dynasties from several cities, the \"USKL\" starts with a single long list of rulers from Kish (including rulers who, in the \"SKL\" were part of different Kish dynasties), followed by a few other dynasties, followed again by the kings of Akkad.\nContents.\nThe sources differ in their exact contents. This is not only the result of many sources being fragmentary, it is also the result of scribal errors made during copying of the composition, and of the fact that changes were made to the composition through time. For example, the section on rulers before the flood is not present in every copy of the text, including every text from Nippur, where the majority of versions of the \"SKL\" were found. Also, the order of some of the dynasties or kings may be changed between copies, some dynasties that were separately mentioned in one version are taken together in another, details on the lengths of individual reigns vary, and individual kings may be left out entirely.\nThe following summary and line numbers are taken from the compilation by the \"Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature\", which in turn takes the text of the Weld-Blundell prism as its main source, listing other versions when there are differences in the text.\nLines 1\u201339: before the flood.\nThis section, which is not present in every copy of the text, opens with the line \"After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridu.\" Two kings of Eridu are mentioned, before the city \"fell\" and the \"kingship was taken to Bad-tibira\". This pattern of cities receiving kingship and then falling or being defeated, only to be succeeded by the next, is present throughout the entire text, often in the exact same words. This first section lists eight kings who ruled over five cities (apart from Eridu and Bad-tibira, these also included Larag, Zimbir and Shuruppak). The duration of each reign is also given. In this first section, the reigns vary between 43,200 and 28,800 years for a total of 241,200 years. The section ends with the line \"Then the flood swept over\". Among the kings mentioned in this section is the ancient Mesopotamian god Dumuzid (the later Tammuz).\nLines 40\u2013265: first dynasty of Kish to Lugal-zage-si.\n\"After the flood had swept over, and the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish.\" After this well-known line, the section goes on to list 23 kings of Kish, who ruled between 1500 and 300 years for a total of 24,510 years. The exact number of years varies between copies. Apart from the lengths of their reigns and whether they were the son of their predecessor (for example, \"Mashda, the son of Atab, ruled for 840 years\"), no other details are usually given on the exploits of these kings. Exceptions are Etana, \"who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries\" and Enmebaragesi, \"who made the land of Elam submit\". Enmebaragesi is also the first king in the \"Sumerian King List\" whose name is attested from contemporaneous (Early Dynastic I) inscriptions. His successor Aga of Kish, the final king mentioned before Kish fell and kingship was taken to E-ana, also appears in the poem Gilgamesh and Aga.\nThe next lines, up until Sargon of Akkad, show a steady succession of cities and kings, usually without much detail beyond the lengths of the individual reigns. Every entry is structured exactly the same: the city where kingship is located is named, followed by one or more kings and how long they reigned, followed by a summary and a final line indicating where kingship went next. Lines 134\u2013147 may serve as an example:In Ur, Mesannepada became king; he ruled for 80 years. Meskiagnun, the son of Mesannepada, became king; he ruled for 36 years. Elulu ruled for 25 years. Balulu ruled for 36 years. 4 kings; they ruled for 171 years. Then Ur was defeated and the kingship was taken to Awan.Individual reigns vary in length, from 1200 years for Lugalbanda of Uruk, to six years for another king of Uruk and several kings of Akshak. On average, the number of regnal years decreases down the list. Some city names, such as Uruk, Ur and Kish, appear more than once in the \"Sumerian King List\". The earlier part of this section mentions several kings who are also known from other literary sources. These kings include Dumuzid the Fisherman and Gilgamesh, although virtually no king from the earlier part of this section appears in inscriptions dating from the actual period in which they were supposed to live. Lines 211\u2013223 describe a dynasty from Mari, which is a city outside Sumer proper but which played an important role in Mesopotamian history during the late third and early second millennia BC. The following third dynasty of Kish consists of a single ruler Kug-Bau (\"the woman tavern keeper\"), thought to be the only queen listed in the \"Sumerian King List\". The final two dynasties of this section, the fourth of Kish and the third of Uruk, provide a link to the next section. Sargon of Akkad is mentioned in the \"Sumerian King List\" as cup-bearer to Ur-zababa of Kish, and he defeated Lugal-zage-si of Uruk before founding his own dynasty.\nLines 266\u2013377: Akkad to Isin.\nThis section is devoted to the well-known Akkadian ruler Sargon and his successors. After the entry on Shar-kali-sharri, the \"Sumerian King List\" reads \"Then who was king? Who was not king?\", suggesting a period of chaos that may reflect the uncertain times during which the Akkadian Empire came to an end. Four kings are mentioned to have ruled for a total of only three years. Of the Akkadian kings mentioned after Shar-kali-sharri, only the names of Dudu and Shu-turul have been attested in inscriptions dating from the Akkadian period. The Akkadian dynasty is succeeded by the fourth dynasty of Uruk, two kings of which, Ur-nigin and his son Ur-gigir, appear in other contemporary inscriptions. Kingship was then taken to the \"land\" or \"army\" of Gutium, of which it was said that at first they had no kings and that they ruled themselves for a few years. After this short episode, 21 Gutian kings are listed before the fall of Gutium and kingship was taken to Uruk. Only one ruler is listed during this period of kingship (Utu-hegal), before it moved on to Ur. The so-called Third Dynasty of Ur consisted of 5 kings who ruled between 9 and 46 years. No other details of their exploits are given. The \"Sumerian King List\" remarks that, after the rule of Ur was abolished, \"The very foundation of Sumer was torn out\", after which kingship was taken to Isin. The kings of Isin are the final dynasty that is included in the list. The dynasty consisted of 14 kings who ruled between 3 and 33 years. As with the Ur III dynasty, no details are given on the reigns of individual kings.\nLines 378\u2013431: summary.\nSome versions of the \"Sumerian King List\" conclude with a summary of the dynasties after the flood. In this summary, the number of kings and their accumulated regnal years are mentioned for each city, as well as the number of times that city had received kingship: \"A total of 12 kings ruled for 396 years, 3 times in Urim.\" The final line again tallies the numbers for all these dynasties: \"There are 11 cities, cities in which the kingship was exercised. A total of 134 kings, who altogether ruled for 28876 + X years.\"\nDiscussion.\nAssyriologist Piotr Steinkeller has observed that, with the exception of the Epic of Gilgamesh, there might not be a single cuneiform text with as much \"name recognition\" as the \"Sumerian King List\". The \"SKL\" might also be among the compositions that have fuelled the most intense debate and controversy among academia. These debates generally focused on when, where and why it was created, and if and how the text can be used in the reconstruction of the political history of Mesopotamia during the third and second millennia BC.\nDating, redaction and purpose.\nAll but one of the surviving versions of the \"Sumerian King List\" date to the Old Babylonian period, i.e. the early part of the second millennium BC. One version, the \"Ur III Sumerian King List\" (\"USKL\") dates to the reign of Shulgi (2084\u20132037 BC). By carefully comparing the different versions, especially the \"USKL\" with the much later Old Babylonian versions of the \"SKL\", it has been shown that the composition that is now known as the \"SKL\" was probably first created in the Sargonic period in a form very similar to the \"USKL\". It has even been suggested that this precursor of the \"SKL\" was not written in Sumerian, but in Akkadian. The original contents of the \"USKL\", especially the pre-Sargonic part, were probably significantly altered only after the Ur III period, as a reaction to the societal upheaval that resulted from the disintegration of the Ur III state at the end of the third millennium BC. This altering of the composition meant that the original long, uninterrupted list of kings of Kish was cut up in smaller dynasties (e.g. Kish I, Kish II, and so forth), and that other dynasties were inserted. The result was the \"SKL\" as it is known from Old Babylonian manuscripts such as the Weld-Blundell prism. The cyclical change of kingship from one city to the next became a so-called \"Leitmotif\", or recurring theme, in the \"Sumerian King List\".\nIt has been generally accepted that the main aim was not to provide a historiographical record of the political landscape of ancient Mesopotamia. Instead, it has been suggested that the \"SKL\", in its various redactions, was used by contemporary rulers to legitimize their claims to power over Babylonia. Steinkeller has argued that the \"SKL\" was first created during the Akkad dynasty to position Akkad as a direct heir to the hegemony of Kish. Thus, it would make sense to present the predecessors to the Akkadian kings as a long, unbroken line of rulers from Kish. In this way the Akkadian dynasty could legitimize its claims to power over Babylonia by arguing that, from the earliest times onwards, there had always been a single city where kingship was exercised. Later rulers then used the \"Sumerian King List\" for their own political purposes, amending and adding to the text as they saw fit. This is why, for example, the version recorded on the Weld-Blundell prism ends with the Isin dynasty, suggesting that it was now their turn to rule over Mesopotamia as the rightful inheritors of the Ur III legacy. The use of the \"SKL\" as political propaganda may also explain why some versions, including the older \"USKL\", did not contain the antediluvian part of the list. In its original form, the list started with the hegemony of Kish. Some city-states may have been uncomfortable with the preeminent position of Kish. By inserting a section of primordial kings who ruled before a flood, which is only known from some Old Babylonian versions, the importance of Kish could be downplayed.\nReliability as a historical source.\nDuring much of the 20th century, many scholars accepted the \"Sumerian King List\" as a historical source of great importance for the reconstruction of the political history of Mesopotamia, despite the problems associated with the text. For example, many scholars have observed that the kings in the early part of the list reigned for unnaturally long time spans. Various approaches have been offered to reconcile these long reigns with a historical time line in which reigns would fall within reasonable human bounds, and with what is known from the archaeological record as well as other textual sources. Thorkild Jacobsen argued in his major 1939 study of the \"SKL\" that, in principle, all rulers mentioned in the list should be considered historical because their names were taken from older lists that were kept for administrative purposes and could therefore be considered reliable. His solution to the reigns considered too long, then, was to argue that \"[t]heir occurrence in our material must be ascribed to a tendency known also among other peoples of antiquity to form very exaggerated ideas of the length of human life in the earliest times of which they were conscious.\" In order to create a fixed chronology where individual kings could be absolutely dated, Jacobsen replaced time spans considered too long with average reigns of 20\u201330 years. For example, Etana ruled for 1500 years according to the \"SKL\", but instead Jacobsen assumed a reign of circa 30 years. In this manner, and by working backwards from reigns whose dates could be independently established by other means, Jacobsen was able to fit all pre-Sargonic kings in a chronology consistent with the dates that were at that time (1939) accepted for the Early Dynastic period in Mesopotamia. Jacobsen has been criticised for putting too much faith in the reliability of the king list, for making wishful reconstructions and readings of incomplete parts of the list, for ignoring inconsistencies between the \"SKL\" and other textual evidence, and for ignoring the fact that only very few of the pre-Sargonic rulers have been attested in contemporaneous (i.e. Early Dynastic) inscriptions.\nOthers have attempted to reconcile the reigns in the \"Sumerian\" \"King List\" by arguing that many time spans were actually consciously invented, mathematically derived numbers. Rowton, for example, observed that a majority of the reigns in the Gutian dynasty were 5, 6, or 7 years in length. In the sexagesimal system used at that time, \"about 6 years\" would be the same as \"about 10 years\" in a decimal system (i.e. a general round number). This was sufficient evidence for him to conclude that at least these figures were completely artificial. The longer time spans from the first part of the list could also be argued to be artificial: various reigns were multiples of 60 (e.g. Jushur reigned for 600 years, Puannum ruled for 840 years) while others were squares (e.g. Ilku reigned for 900 years (square of 30) while Meshkiangasher ruled for 324 years (square of 18)).\nDuring the last few decades, scholars have taken a more careful approach. For example, many recent handbooks on the archaeology and history of ancient Mesopotamia all acknowledge the problematic nature of the \"SKL\" and warn that the list's use as a historical document for that period is severely limited up to the point that it should not be used at all. It has been argued, for example, that the omission of certain cities in the list which were known to have been important at the time, such as Lagash and Larsa, was deliberate. Furthermore, the fact that the \"SKL\" adheres to a strict sequential ordering of kingships which were considered equal means that it does no justice at all to the actual complexities of Mesopotamian political history where different reigns overlapped, or where different rulers or cities were not equally powerful. Recent studies on the \"SKL\" even go so far as to discredit the composition as a valuable historical source on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia altogether. Important arguments to dismiss the \"SKL\" as a reliable and valuable source are its nature as a political, ideological text, its long redactional history, and the fact that out of the many pre-Sargonic kings listed, only seven have been attested in contemporary Early Dynastic inscriptions. The final volume on the history and philology of third millennium BC Mesopotamia of the ESF-funded ARCANE-project (Associated Regional Chronologies for the Ancient Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean), for example, did not list any of the pre-Sargonic rulers from the \"SKL\" in its chronological tables unless their existence was corroborated by Early Dynastic inscriptions.\nThus, in the absence of independent sources from the Early Dynastic period itself, the pre-Sargonic part of the \"SKL\" must be considered fictional. Many of the rulers in the pre-Sargonic part (i.e. prior to Sargon of Akkad) of the list must therefore be considered as purely fictional or mythological characters to which reigns of hundreds of years were assigned. However, there is a small group of pre-Sargonic rulers in the \"SKL\" whose names have been attested in Early Dynastic inscriptions. This group consists of seven rulers: Enmebaragesi, Gilgamesh, Mesannepada, Meskiagnun, Elulu, Enshakushanna and Lugal-zage-si. It has also been shown that several kings did not rule sequentially as described by the \"Sumerian King List\", but rather contemporaneously. Starting with the Akkadian rulers, but especially for the Ur III and Isin dynasties, the \"SKL\" becomes much more reliable. Not only are most of the kings attested in other contemporaneous documents, but the reigns attributed to them in the \"SKL\" are more or less in line with what can be established from those other sources. This is probably due to the fact that the compilers of the \"SKL\" could rely on lists of year names, which came in regular use during the Akkadian period. Other sources may have included votive and victory inscriptions.\nHowever, while the \"SKL\" has little value for the study on Early Dynastic Mesopotamia, it continues to be an important document for the study on the Sargonic to Old Babylonian periods. The \"Sumerian King List\" offers scholars a window into how Old Babylonian kings and scribes viewed their own history, how they perceived the concept of kingship, and how they could have used it to further their own goals. For example, it has been noted that the king list is unique among Sumerian compositions in there being no divine intervention in the process of dynastic change. Also, the style and contents of the \"Sumerian King List\" certainly influenced later compositions such as the \"Curse of Akkad\", the \"Lamentation over Sumer and Akkad\", later king lists such as the \"Assyrian King List\", and the \"Babyloniaca\" by Berossus.\nRulers in the Sumerian King List.\nEarly dates are approximate, and are based on available archaeological data. For most of the pre-Akkadian rulers listed, the king list is itself the source of information. Beginning with Lugal-zage-si and the Third Dynasty of Uruk (which was defeated by Sargon of Akkad), a better understanding of how subsequent rulers fit into the chronology of the ancient Near East can be deduced. The short chronology is used here.\nAntediluvian rulers\nNone of the following predynastic antediluvian rulers have been verified as historical by archaeological excavations, epigraphical inscriptions or otherwise. While there is no evidence they ever reigned as such, the Sumerians purported them to have lived in the mythical era before the great deluge.\nThe \"antediluvian\" reigns were measured in Sumerian numerical units known as \"sars\" (units of 3,600), \"ners\" (units of 600), and \"sosses\" (units of 60). Attempts have been made to map these numbers into more reasonable regnal lengths.\nFirst dynasty of Kish\nFirst rulers of Uruk\nFirst dynasty of Ur\nDynasty of Awan\nThis was a dynasty from Elam.\nSecond dynasty of Kish\nThe First dynasty of Lagash (c. 2500 \u2013 c. 2271 BC) is not mentioned in the King List, though it is well known from inscriptions\nDynasty of Hamazi\nSecond dynasty of Uruk\nSecond dynasty of Ur\nDynasty of Adab\nOther rulers of Adab are known, besides Lugal-Ane-mundu, but they are not mentioned in the Sumerian King List.\nDynasty of Mari\nMany rulers are known from Mari, but different names are mentioned in the Sumerian king list.\nThird dynasty of Kish\nDynasty of Akshak\nFourth dynasty of Kish\nThird dynasty of Uruk\nDynasty of Akkad\nFourth dynasty of Uruk\n(Possibly rulers of lower Mesopotamia contemporary with the Dynasty of Akkad)\nThe Second dynasty of Lagash (before c. 2093\u20132046 BC (short)) is not mentioned in the King List, though it is well known from inscriptions.\nGutian rule\nFifth dynasty of Uruk\nThird dynasty of Ur\nDynasty of Isin\nIndependent Amorite states in lower Mesopotamia.\nThe Dynasty of Larsa (c. 1961\u20131674 BC (short)) from this period is not mentioned in the King List.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65411", "revid": "10202399", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65411", "title": "Wired (magazine)", "text": "American technology magazine\nWired is a bi-monthly American magazine that focuses on how emerging technologies affect culture, the economy, and politics. It is published in both print and online editions by Cond\u00e9 Nast. The magazine has been in publication since its launch in January 1993. Its editorial office is based in San Francisco, California, with its business headquarters located in New York City.\n\"Wired\" quickly became recognized as the voice of the emerging digital economy and culture and a pace setter in print design and web design. From 1998 until 2006, the magazine and its website, \"Wired.com\", experienced separate ownership before being fully consolidated under Cond\u00e9 Nast in 2006. It has won multiple National Magazine Awards and has been credited with shaping discourse around the digital revolution. The magazine coined the term \"crowdsourcing\", as well as its annual tradition of handing out Vaporware Awards. \n\"Wired\" has launched several international editions, including \"Wired UK\", \"Wired Italia\", \"Wired Japan\", \"Wired Czech Republic and Slovakia,\" and \"Wired Germany\". The magazine was published monthly until 2024, when it switched to a bi-monthly schedule with six issues per year.\nHistory.\nThe magazine was launched in 1993 by American expatriates Louis Rossetto with his life partner and business partner Jane Metcalfe. \"Wired\" was conceived in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, when they were working on \"Electric Word\", a small, groundbreaking technology magazine that developed a global following because of its focus not just on hardware and software, but the people, companies, and ideas that were part of what they called the language industries. \"Whole Earth Review\" called it \"The Least Boring Computer Magazine in the World\". This broader focus on the social, economic, and political issues surrounding technology became the core of the \"Wired\" editorial approach.\nInitial funding for \"Wired\" was provided by Eckart Wintzen, a Dutch entrepreneur. His Origin software company extended a contract for advertising and bought the first 1000 subscribers. Rossetto and Metcalfe moved back to the United States to start \"Wired\", finding the European Union not a cohesive enough media market to support a continent-wide publication.\nOrigin's upfront payment was the seed capital which saw Rossetto and Metcalfe through 12 fruitless months of fundraising. They approached established computer and lifestyle publishers, as well as venture capitalists, and met constant rejection. The \"Wired\" business concept was a radical departure. Computer magazines carried no lifestyle advertising, and lifestyle magazines carried no computer advertising. And Wired's target audience of \"Digital Visionaries\" was unknown.\n\"Wired\"'s fundraising breakthrough came when they showed a prototype to Nicholas Negroponte, founder and head of the MIT Media Lab at the February 1992 TED Conference, which Richard Saul Wurman comped them to attend. Negroponte agreed to become the first investor in \"Wired,\" but even before he could write his check, software entrepreneur Charlie Jackson deposited the first investor money in the \"Wired\" account a few weeks later. Negroponte was to become a regular columnist for six years (through 1998), wrote the book \"Being Digital\", and later founded One Laptop per Child.\nBy September 1992, \"Wired\" had rented loft space in the SoMa district of San Francisco off South Park and hired its first employees. As Editor and CEO, Rossetto oversaw content and business strategy, and Metcalfe, as President and COO, oversaw advertising, circulation, finance, and company operations. Kevin Kelly was executive editor, John Plunkett creative director, and John Battelle managing editor. John Plunkett's wife and partner, Barbara Kuhr (Plunkett+Kuhr) later became the launch creative director of \"Wired's\" website Hotwired. They were to remain with \"Wired\" through the first six years of publication, 1993\u201398.\nRossetto and Metcalfe were aided in starting \"Wired\" by Ian Charles Stewart, who helped write the original business plan, John Plunkett, who designed the \"Manifesto\", Eugene Mosier, who provided production support to create the first prototype (and later became Art Director for Production), and Randy Stickrod, who provided Rossetto and Metcalfe refuge in his office on South Park when they first arrived in San Francisco. IDG's George Clark arranged nationwide newsstand distribution. Associate publisher Kathleen Lyman joined Wired from News Corporation and Ziff Davis to execute on its ambition to attract both technology and lifestyle advertising, and delivered from the first issue. She and her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Simon Ferguson (\"Wired\"'s first advertising manager) landed pioneering campaigns by a diverse group of industry leaders such as Apple Computer, Intel, Sony, Calvin Klein, and Absolut. Lyman and Ferguson left in year two. Cond\u00e9 Nast veteran Dana Lyon then took over ad sales. Two years after they left Amsterdam, and nearly five years after they first started work on the business plan, Metcalfe and Rossetto and their initial band of twelve Wired Ones launched \"Wired\" as a quarterly on 6 January 1993 and first distributed it by hand at Macworld Expo in San Francisco and, later that week, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Copies arrived on newsstand two weeks later as Bill Clinton took office as President, with his Vice President Al Gore touting the Information Superhighway. Due to the work of John Battelle's fianc\u00e9e, ex-CBS producer Michelle Scileppi, feature pieces on \"Wired\"\u2019s launch appeared on CNN and in \"The San Jose Mercury News\", \"Newsweek\" and \"Time\" magazines.\nCirculation and advertising response was so strong that \"Wired\" went bi-monthly with its next issue, and monthly by September with the William Gibson cover story about Singapore called \"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\", which was banned there. In January 1994, Advance Publications's Cond\u00e9 Nast made a minority investment in Wired Ventures. And in April that year, \"Wired\" won its first National Magazine Award for General Excellence for its first year of publication. During Rossetto's five years as editor, it would be nominated for General Excellence every year, win the design award in 1996, and a second General Excellence in 1997.\n\"Wired\"\u2019s founding executive editor, Kevin Kelly, had been an editor of the \"Whole Earth Catalog, Co-Evolution Quarterly\", and the \"Whole Earth Review\". He brought with him contributing writers from those publications. Six authors of the first \"Wired\" issue (1.1) had written for \"Whole Earth Review\", most notably Bruce Sterling (who was on the first cover) and Stewart Brand. Other contributors to \"Whole Earth\" who appeared in \"Wired\" included William Gibson, who was also featured on Wired's cover in its first year.\n\"Wired\" co-founder Rossetto claimed in his launch editorial that \"the Digital Revolution is whipping through our lives like a Bengali typhoon\", a bold statement at the time, when there were no smart phones, web browsers, and less than 10 million users connected to the Internet around the world, barely half that in the United States. Bold also describes John Plunkett's graphic design, and its use of fluorescents and metallics. Uniquely for magazines, \"Wired\" was printed on a new, state of the art, high-end, six color press normally used for annual reports.\nThe first issue covered interactive games, cell-phone hacking, digital special effects, digital libraries, an interview with Camille Paglia by Stewart Brand, digital surveillance, Bruce Sterling's cover story about military simulations, and Karl Taro Greenfeld\u2019s story on Japanese otaku. And while Wired was one of the first magazines to list the email addresses of its authors and contributors, the column by Nicholas Negroponte, while written in the style of an email message, surprisingly contained an obviously fake, non-standard email address.\nThat was remedied in the second issue. \"Wired\" first mentioned the World Wide Web in its third issue, after CERN put it in the public domain in April. Subsequently, \"Wired\" focused extensively on the networking explosion, carrying cover stories on Yahoo's origin story, Neal Stephenson's 50,000 word, epic essay on the laying of the fiber optic datalink from London to Japan, and Bill Gate's media strategy for Microsoft.\nOn October 27, 1994, 20 months after its first issue, and following the introduction of the first graphic web browser Mosaic, Wired Ventures launched its \"Hotwired\" website, the first with original content and Fortune 500 advertising. Inventing the banner ad, Wired brought ATT, Volvo, MCI, Club Med and seven other companies to the web for the first time on websites built by Jonathan Nelson's Organic Online. Among the launch crew of 12 was Jonathan Steuer, who led the group, Justin Hall, a pioneer blogger who ran his own successful site on the side, Howard Rheingold as executive editor, and Apache server co-creator Brian Behlendorf, who was webmaster.\nConvinced the Web was the future of media, \"Wired\" expanded Hotwired using Cond\u00e9 Nast's investment into a suite of websites to include Ask Dr. Weil, Rough Guides, extreme sports, and cocktails. In 1996, it introduced its search engine HotBot in partnership with Berkeley startup Inktomi. Hotwired pioneered many of the features and techniques that would go on to define online journalism and online content creation in general. The web was so new at the time, \"Wired\" hired forty engineers to write the code for its edit and ad serving software. By the end of 1995, Hotwired ranked sixth among all websites for revenue, ahead of ESPN, CNET, and CNN.\n\"The New York Times\" commented, \"\"Wired\" is more than a successful magazine. Like Rolling Stone in the 60's, it has become the totem of a major cultural movement.\"\nWired's expansion accelerated. By 1996, it had launched a book publishing division (HardWired), licensed a Japanese edition with Dohosha Publishing, created a British edition (\"Wired UK\") in a joint venture with the Guardian newspaper, and had signed with Gruner and Jahr to do a German edition to be headquartered in Berlin. And it began work on Wired TV in partnership with MSNBC, as well as three new magazine titles: a shelter book called \"Neo\" to be edited by \"Wired\" Editor-At-Large Katrina Heron and designed by Rhonda Rubenstein; a business magazine called \"The New Economy\"; and a concept magazine with New York design star Tibor Kalman focusing on the countdown to the new millennium.\nIn 1996, reacting to the IPOs of web competitors Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, and Infoseek, Wired Ventures announced its own IPO. It selected Goldman Sachs and Robertson Stephens as co-leads, with Goldman managing. The June IPO was postponed when the market declined. When it finally went out in October, Goldman was unable to close the round following another market downturn, and \"Wired\" withdrew its IPO.\nFingerpointing followed. Some observers claimed the market rejected Wired's $293 million \"internet valuation\" as too rich for a traditional publishing company. \"Wired\" claimed its valuation was confirmed by savvy private investors who put $12.5 million into the company in May at just under the original offering stock price. It also argued that the offering price set by the bankers was merited for pioneering web media, and its revenue at Hotwired was greater than Yahoo's when it went public at a higher valuation than Wired's. \"Wired\" executives blamed Goldman for mismanaging their IPO and not closing the round which already had investors booked. The Goldman executive who managed the IPO is quoted as saying \"Had the market not been so volatile, I believe the offering would have been quite successful.\"\nThe IPO failure left Wired Ventures cash-strapped. It turned to its current investor Tudor Investment Corporation. Tudor brought on Providence Equity Capital, concluding a private funding at the end of December 1996. Wired then proceeded to cut costs by focusing on its US magazine and web businesses, shutting its UK magazine, its book company, and its TV operation, and terminating work on new magazines. By June, \"Wired\" magazine was profitable. The web company, now rebranded Wired Digital, was growing. Wired execs wanted to try to go public again in 1998, catching what was to be the second run-up in internet stocks which resulted in the 1999 dot-com bubble. In 1996, Wired Digital made up 7 percent of the company's revenues, and in 1997 it pulled in 30 percent. The unit was expected to contribute about 40 percent of revenues in 1998.\nProvidence and Tudor had other plans, and hired Lazard Freres to shop the company. Rossetto and Metcalfe lost control of Wired Ventures in March 1998. The Street.com commented that a \"company that started out as one of the more promising bastions of the digital revolution lost control to old-fashioned vulture capitalism\".\nProvidence/Tudor quickly cut a deal to sell the magazine to Miller Publishing for $77 million. When Wired Ventures investor Cond\u00e9 Nast heard about the deal through a leak to a Silicon Valley gossip columnist, they peremptorily outbid Miller and bought \"Wired\" magazine for $90 million. The month of the sale, \"Wired\"\u2019s magazine and web businesses became cashflow positive. Cond\u00e9 Nast declined to buy Wired Digital. Four months later, Providence/Tudor sold \"Wired Digital\" to Lycos.\nThe deal almost did not close. Wired Ventures's founders and early investors threatened lawsuits against Tudor and Providence for breach of fiduciary responsibility, claiming they were engaging in unfair distribution of proceeds from the sale amounting to $50-100 million. Ultimately, the controlling investors relented, and the deal closed in June 1999 for $285 million. At that point, Wired Digital was also cashflow positive. Combined proceeds of the two sales exceeded the Wired Ventures valuation at the time of its failed IPO.\nRossetto's penultimate issue was five years after his first, in January 1998. Appropriately, the issue was entitled \"Change is Good\", Wired's unofficial slogan. In his last issue in February, he ushered in a complete redesign of the magazine, the first since its start. Katrina Heron became \"Wired\"\u2019s second editor-in-chief with the March 1998 issue.\n\"Wired\" magazine's new owner Cond\u00e9 Nast kept the editorial offices in San Francisco, but moved the business offices to New York\". Wired\" survived the dot-com bubble under the business leadership of publisher Drew Schutte who expanded the brands reach by launching The Wired Store and Wired NextFest. In 2001 \"Wired\" found new editorial direction under editor-in-chief Chris Anderson, making the magazine's coverage \"more mainstream\". The print magazine's average page length, however, declined significantly from 1996 to 2001 and then again from 2001 to 2003.\nIn 2009, Cond\u00e9 Nast Italia launched the Italian edition of \"Wired\" and \"Wired.it\". On April 2, 2009, Cond\u00e9 Nast relaunched the UK edition of \"Wired\", edited by David Rowan, and launched \"Wired.co.uk\".\nIn 2006, Cond\u00e9 Nast repurchased Wired Digital from Lycos, returning the website to the same company that published the magazine, reuniting the brand.\nIn August 2023, Katie Drummond was announced as the new editor of \"Wired\".\nIn 2025, during the second presidency of Donald Trump, \"Wired\" became noted for breaking numerous stories about the Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk criticized the magazine, saying \"Wired\" \"went from being about technology to being an unreadable, far-left wing propaganda mouthpiece.\"\nIn August 2025, Jacob Furedi, the former deputy editor of UnHerd and editor of the publication \"Dispatch\", investigated articles on \"Business Insider\" and \"Wired\" written by a supposed freelancer named Margaux Blanchard after receiving an email. After concluding that the articles were AI-generated, he contacted Press Gazette. Both \"Business Insider\" and \"Wired\" subsequently removed the articles.\nOnline magazine.\n\"Wired\"'s web presence started with its launch of Hotwired.com in October 1994. Hotwired was the first website with original content and Fortune 500 advertising. Hotwired grew into a variety of vertical content sites, including Webmonkey, Ask Dr. Weil, Talk.com, WiredNews, and the search engine Hotbot. In 1997, all were rebranded under Wired Digital. The Wired.com website, formerly known as Wired News and \"Hotwired\", launched in October 1994. The website and magazine were split in 1998, when the former was sold to Cond\u00e9 Nast and the latter to Lycos in September 1998. The two remained independent until Cond\u00e9 Nast purchased \"Wired News\" on July 11, 2006. This move finally reunited the \"Wired\" brand.\nAs of February 2018, \"Wired.com\" is paywalled. Users may only access a limited number of articles per month without payment.\nToday, \"Wired.com\" hosts several technology blogs on topics in security, business, new products, culture, and science.\nFrom 2004 to 2008, \"Wired\" organized an annual \"festival of innovative products and technologies\". A NextFest for 2009 was canceled. In 2018, \"Wired\" hosted \"Wired 25\", a celebration of its 25 years, an event which included Jeff Bezos, Jack Dorsey, and many of the other founders of the tech industry.\nSupplements.\n\"Geekipedia: 149 People, Places, Ideas \"and\" Trends you need to know \"now\"\" was a one-off paperback supplement to \"WIRED\" 15.09 published on January 1, 2007.\nContributors.\n\"Wired\"'s writers have included Jorn Barger, John Perry Barlow, John Battelle, Paul Boutin, Stewart Brand, Gareth Branwyn, Po Bronson, Scott Carney, Michael Chorost, Douglas Coupland, James Daly, Joshua Davis, J.

{"id": "65414", "revid": "753665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65414", "title": "Jacques Offenbach", "text": "German-born French composer (1819\u20131880)\nJacques Offenbach (; 20 June 1819\u00a0\u2013 5 October 1880) was a German-born French composer, cellist and impresario. He is remembered for his nearly 100 operettas of the 1850s to the 1870s, and his uncompleted opera \"The Tales of Hoffmann\". He was a powerful influence on later composers of the operetta genre, particularly Franz von Supp\u00e9, Johann Strauss II and Arthur Sullivan. His best-known works were continually revived during the 20th century, and many of his operettas continue to be staged in the 21st. \"The Tales of Hoffmann\" remains part of the standard opera repertory.\nBorn in Cologne, Kingdom of Prussia, the son of a synagogue cantor, Offenbach showed early musical talent. At the age of 14, he was accepted as a student at the Paris Conservatoire; he found academic study unfulfilling and left after a year, but remained in Paris. From 1835 to 1855 he earned his living as a cellist, achieving international fame, and as a conductor. His ambition, however, was to compose comic pieces for the musical theatre. Finding the management of Paris's company uninterested in staging his works, in 1855 he leased a small theatre in the . There, during the next three years, he presented a series of more than two dozen of his own small-scale pieces, many of which became popular.\nIn 1858 Offenbach produced his first full-length operetta, (\"Orpheus in the Underworld\"), with its celebrated can-can; the work was exceptionally well received and has remained his most played. During the 1860s, he produced at least eighteen full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period include (1864), (1866), (1867) and (1868). The risqu\u00e9 humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London, elsewhere in Europe and in the US.\nOffenbach became associated with the Second French Empire of Napoleon III: the emperor and his court were genially satirised in many of Offenbach's operettas, and Napoleon personally granted him French citizenship and the . With the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and the fall of the empire, Offenbach found himself out of favour in Paris because of his imperial connections and his German birth. He remained successful in Vienna, London and New York. He re-established himself in Paris during the 1870s, with revivals of some of his earlier favourites and a series of new works, and undertook a popular US tour. In his last years he strove to finish \"The Tales of Hoffmann\", but died before the premiere of the opera, which has entered the standard repertory in versions completed or edited by other musicians.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nOffenbach was born on 20 June 1819, as Jacob (or Jakob) Offenbach to a Jewish family in the German city of Cologne, which was then a part of Prussia. His birthplace in the was a short distance from the square that is now named after him, the . He was the second son and the seventh of ten children of Isaac Juda Offenbach n\u00e9 Eberst (1779\u20131850) and his wife Marianne n\u00e9e Rindskopf (c.\u20091783\u20131840). Isaac, who came from a musical family, had abandoned his original trade as a bookbinder and earned an itinerant living as a cantor in synagogues and playing the violin in caf\u00e9s. He was generally known as \"\", after his native town, Offenbach am Main, and in 1808 he officially adopted Offenbach as a surname. In 1816 he settled in Cologne, where he became established as a teacher, giving lessons in singing, violin, flute, and guitar, and composing both religious and secular music.\nWhen Jacob was six years old his father taught him to play the violin; within two years the boy was composing songs and dances, and at the age of nine he took up the cello. As Isaac was by then the permanent cantor of the local synagogue, he could afford to pay for his son to take lessons from the well-known cellist Bernhard Breuer. Three years later, the biographer Gabriel Grovlez records, the boy was giving performances of his own compositions, \"the technical difficulties of which terrified his master\", Breuer. Together with his brother Julius (violin) and sister Isabella (piano), Jacob played in a trio at local dance halls, inns and caf\u00e9s, performing popular dance music and operatic arrangements. In 1833 Isaac decided that his musically talented sons Julius and Jacob (then aged 18 and 14) needed to leave the provincial musical scene of Cologne to study in Paris. With generous support from local music lovers and the municipal orchestra, with whom they gave a farewell concert on 9 October, the two young musicians, accompanied by their father, made the four-day journey to Paris in November 1833.\nIsaac had been given letters of introduction to the director of the Paris Conservatoire, Luigi Cherubini, but had to persuade Cherubini even to give Jacob an audition. The boy's age and nationality were both obstacles to admission. Cherubini had several years earlier refused the twelve-year-old Franz Liszt admission on similar grounds, but he eventually agreed to hear the young Offenbach play. He listened to his playing and stopped him, saying, \"Enough, young man, you are now a pupil of this Conservatoire.\" Julius was also admitted. Both brothers adopted French forms of their names, Julius becoming Jules and Jacob becoming Jacques.\nIsaac hoped to secure permanent employment in Paris but failed to do so and returned to Cologne. Before leaving, he found several pupils for Jules; the modest earnings from those lessons, supplemented by fees earned by both brothers as members of synagogue choirs, supported them during their studies. At the conservatoire, Jules was a diligent student; he graduated and became a successful violin teacher and conductor, and was of his younger brother's orchestra for several years. By contrast, Jacques was bored by academic study and left after a year. The conservatoire's roll of students notes against his name \"Struck off on 2\u00a0December 1834 (left of his own free will)\".\nCello virtuoso.\nHaving left the conservatoire, Offenbach was free from the stern academicism of Cherubini's curriculum, but as the biographer James Harding writes, \"he was free, also, to starve\". He secured a few temporary jobs in theatre orchestras before gaining a permanent appointment in 1835 as a cellist at the . He was no more serious there than he had been at the conservatoire, and regularly had his pay docked for playing pranks during performances; on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues' music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance. Nevertheless, the earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Hal\u00e9vy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that the young man was going to be a great composer. Some of Offenbach's early compositions were played by the fashionable conductor Louis-Antoine Jullien. Offenbach and another young composer, Friedrich von Flotow, collaborated in 1839 on a series of works for cello and piano. Although Offenbach's ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entr\u00e9e to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris. Through contacts he made there he gained pupils. In 1838 the commissioned him to compose songs for the play , staged in March 1839. In January 1839, together with his elder brother, he gave his first public concert.\nAmong the salons at which Offenbach most frequently appeared, from 1839, was that of Madeleine-Sophie, . There he met H\u00e9rminie d'Alcain, the fifteen-year-old daughter of a Carlist general. They fell in love, and in 1843 they became engaged, but he was not yet in a financial position to marry. To extend his fame and earning power beyond Paris, he undertook tours of France and Germany. Among those with whom he performed were Anton Rubinstein and in September 1843 in a concert in Offenbach's native Cologne, Liszt. In 1844, probably through English family connections of H\u00e9rminie, he embarked on a tour of England. There, he was immediately engaged to appear with some of the most famous musicians of the day, including Felix Mendelssohn, Joseph Joachim, Michael Costa and Julius Benedict. \"The Era\" wrote of his debut performance in London, \"His execution and taste excited both wonder and pleasure, the genius he exhibited amounting to absolute inspiration.\" The British press reported a triumphant royal command performance; \"The Illustrated London News\" observed, \"Herr Jacques Offenbach, the astonishing Violoncellist, performed on Thursday evening at Windsor before the Emperor of Russia, the King of Saxony, Queen Victoria, and Prince Albert with great success.\" The use of the German \"\", reflecting the fact that Offenbach remained a Prussian citizen, was common to all the British press coverage of Offenbach's 1844 tour. The ambiguity of his nationality sometimes caused him difficulty in later life when France and Prussia became enemies.\nOffenbach returned to Paris with his reputation and his bank balance both much enhanced. The last remaining obstacle to his marriage to H\u00e9rminie was the difference in their professed religions; he converted to Roman Catholicism, with the acting as his sponsor. Isaac Offenbach's views on his son's conversion from Judaism are unknown. The wedding took place on 14 August 1844; the bride was seventeen years old, and the bridegroom was twenty-five. The marriage was lifelong, and happy, despite some extramarital affairs on Offenbach's part. After Offenbach's death, a friend said that H\u00e9rminie \"gave him courage, shared his ordeals and comforted him always with tenderness and devotion\".\nReturning to the familiar Paris salons, Offenbach gradually shifted the emphasis of his work from being a cellist who also composed to being a composer who also played the cello. He had already published many compositions, and some of them had sold well, but now he began to write, perform and produce musical burlesques as part of his salon presentations. He amused the comtesse de Vaux's 200 guests with a parody of F\u00e9licien David's currently fashionable , and in April 1846 gave a concert at which seven operatic items of his own composition were premiered before an audience that included leading music critics. The following year he staged his first operetta, the one-act . It had been written at the invitation of the , which had then failed to present it, and Offenbach mounted the production himself as part of an evening of his works at the . He seemed on the verge of breaking into theatrical composition when the 1848 revolution broke out, sweeping Louis Philippe from the throne and leading to serious bloodshed in the streets of the capital. Three hundred and fifty people were killed within three days. Offenbach hastily took H\u00e9rminie and their two-year-old daughter to join his family in Cologne. The city was experiencing its own nationalistic revolutionary upheaval and Offenbach found it expedient to change his forename back to the German while there.\nReturning to Paris in February 1849 Offenbach found the grand salons closed down. He went back to working as a cellist, and occasional conductor, at the , but was not encouraged in his aspirations to compose. His talents had been noted by the director of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, Ars\u00e8ne Houssaye, who appointed him musical director of the theatre in 1850, with a brief to enlarge and improve the orchestra. Offenbach composed songs and incidental music for eleven classical and modern dramas for the in the early 1850s. Some of his songs became very popular, and he gained valuable experience in writing for the theatre. Houssaye later wrote that Offenbach had done wonders for his theatre, but the management of the was uninterested in commissioning him to compose for its stage. The composer and critic Claude Debussy later wrote that the musical establishment could not cope with Offenbach's irony, which exposed the \"false, overblown quality\" of the operas they favoured \u2013 \"the great art at which one was not allowed to smile\".\nBetween 1853 and May 1855 Offenbach wrote three one-act operettas and managed to have them staged in Paris. They were all well received, but the authorities of the remained unmoved. Offenbach found more encouragement from the composer, singer and impresario Florimond Ronger, known professionally as . At his theatre, the , opened in 1854, pioneered French light comic opera, or \"\". In \"The Musical Quarterly\", Martial Teneo and Theodore Baker wrote, \"Without the example set by , Offenbach might perhaps never have become the musician who penned , , and so many other triumphant works.\" Offenbach approached , who agreed to present a new one-act operetta with words by Jules Moinaux and music by Offenbach, called . It was presented on 26 June 1855 and was well received. Offenbach's biographer Peter Gammond describes it as \"a charming piece of nonsense\". The piece depicts a double-bass player, played by , shipwrecked on a cannibal island, who after several perilous encounters with the female chief of the cannibals makes his escape using his double-bass as a boat. Offenbach pressed ahead with plans to present his works himself at his own theatre and to abandon further thoughts of acceptance by the .\nOffenbach had chosen his theatre, the Salle Lacaze in the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The location and the timing were ideal for him. Paris was about to be filled between May and November with visitors from France and abroad for the 1855 Great Exhibition. The Salle Lacaze was next to the exhibition site. He later wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;In the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, there was a little theatre to let, built for [the magician] but closed for many years. I knew that the Exhibition of 1855 would bring many people into this locality. By May, I had found twenty supporters and on 15 June I secured the lease. Twenty days later, I gathered my librettists and I opened the .\nThe description of the theatre as \"little\" was accurate: it could hold an audience of at most 300. It was therefore well suited to the tiny casts permitted under the prevailing licensing laws: Offenbach was limited to three speaking (or singing) characters in any piece. With such small forces, full-length works were out of the question, and Offenbach, like Herv\u00e9, presented evenings of several one-act pieces. The opening of the theatre was a frantic rush, with less than a month between the issue of the licence and the opening night on 5\u00a0July 1855. During this period Offenbach had to \"equip the theatre, recruit actors, orchestra and staff, find authors to write material for the opening programme \u2013 and compose the music\". Among those he recruited at short notice was , the nephew of Offenbach's early mentor . Ludovic was a rising civil servant with a passion for the theatre and a gift for dialogue and verse. While maintaining his civil service career he went on to collaborate (sometimes under discreet pseudonyms) with Offenbach in 21 works over the next 24 years.\n wrote the libretto for one of the pieces in the opening programme, but the most popular work of the evening had words by . , \"The Two Blind Men\", is a comedy about two beggars feigning blindness. During rehearsals there had been some concern that the public might judge it to be in poor taste, but it was not only the hit of the season in Paris: it was soon playing successfully in Vienna, London and elsewhere. Another success in 1855 was (The Village Fiddler), which made a star of Hortense Schneider in her first role for Offenbach. When she auditioned for him, aged 22, he engaged her on the spot. From 1855 she was a key member of his companies through much of his career.\nThe Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in 1855 were not yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an unpaved . The public who were flocking to Offenbach's theatre in the summer and autumn of 1855 could not be expected to venture there in the depths of a Parisian winter. He cast about for a suitable venue and found the , known also as the or , in central Paris. He entered into partnership with its proprietor and moved the there for the winter season. The company returned to the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857 and 1859 summer seasons, performing at the in the winter. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the were discontinued.\nOffenbach's first piece for the company's new home was (December 1855), a well-received piece of mock-oriental frivolity, to a libretto by . He followed it with fifteen more one-act operettas over the next three years. They were all for the small casts permitted under his licence, although at the he was granted an increase from three to four singers.\nUnder Offenbach's management, the staged works by many composers. These included new pieces by Leon Gastinel and L\u00e9o Delibes. When Offenbach asked Rossini's permission to revive his comedy , Rossini replied that he was pleased to be able to do anything for \"the Mozart of the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es\". Offenbach revered Mozart above all other composers. He had an ambition to present Mozart's neglected one-act comic opera (\"The Impresario\") at the , and he acquired the score from Vienna. With a text translated and adapted by and , he presented it during the Mozart centenary celebrations in May 1856 as ; it was popular with the public and also greatly enhanced the critical and social standing of the . By command of the emperor, Napoleon III, the company performed at the Tuileries Palace shortly after the first performance.\nIn a long article in in July 1856, Offenbach traced the history of comic opera. He declared that the first work worthy to be called was Philidor's 1759 (Blaise the Cobbler), and he described the gradual divergence of Italian and French notions of comic opera, with verve, imagination and gaiety from Italian composers, and mischief, common sense, good taste and wit from the French composers. He concluded that comic opera had become too grand and inflated. His disquisition was a preliminary to the announcement of an open competition for aspiring composers. A jury of French composers and playwrights including , , , and considered 78 entries; the five short-listed entrants were all asked to set a libretto, , written by and . The joint winners were Georges Bizet and Charles Lecocq. became, and remained, a friend of Offenbach. and Offenbach took a dislike to each other, and their subsequent rivalry was not altogether friendly.\nAlthough the played to full houses, the theatre was constantly on the verge of running out of money, principally because of what his biographer Alexander Faris calls \"Offenbach's incorrigible extravagance as a manager\". An earlier biographer, , wrote, \"Jacques spent money without counting. Whole lengths of velvet were swallowed up in the auditorium; costumes devoured width after width of satin.\" Moreover, Offenbach was personally generous and liberally hospitable. To boost the company's finances, a London season was organised in 1857, half the company remaining in Paris to play at the and the other half performing at the St James's Theatre in the West End of London. The visit was a success, but did not cause the sensation that Offenbach's later works did in London.\nIn 1858, the government lifted the licensing restrictions on the number of performers, and Offenbach was able to present more ambitious works. His first full-length operetta, (\"Orpheus in the Underworld\"), was presented in October 1858. Offenbach, as usual, spent freely on the production, with scenery by , lavish costumes, a cast of twenty principals, and a large chorus and orchestra.\nAs the company was particularly short of money following an abortive season in Berlin, a big success was urgently needed. At first the production seemed merely to be a modest success. It soon benefited from an outraged review by , the critic of the . He condemned the piece for profanity and irreverence to Roman mythology: the theme was the legend of Orpheus and Eurydice, although Napoleon III and his government were generally seen as the real targets of its satire. Offenbach and his librettist seized on this free publicity, and joined in a lively public debate in the columns of the Parisian daily newspaper . Janin's indignation made the public agog to see the work, and the box office takings were prodigious. The piece ran for 228 performances, at a time when a run of 100 nights was considered a success. , in his history of the Bouffes-Parisiens (1860), wrote that the piece closed in June 1859 \u2013 although it was still performing strongly at the box-office \u2013 \"because the actors, who could not tire the public, were themselves exhausted\". Among those who wanted to see the satire of the emperor was the emperor himself, who commanded a performance in April 1860. Despite many great successes during the rest of Offenbach's career, remained his most popular work. Gammond lists among the reasons for its success, \"the sweeping waltzes\" reminiscent of Vienna but with a new French flavour, the patter songs, and \"above all else, of course, the can-can which had led a naughty life in low places since the 1830s or thereabouts and now became a polite fashion, as uninhibited as ever\".\nIn the 1859 season the presented new works by composers including Flotow, Jules Erlanger, , , and Offenbach himself. Of Offenbach's new pieces, , though initially only a mild success, was later revised and gained much popularity; the comedy duet of the two cowardly gendarmes became a favourite number in Britain as well as France and the basis for the Marines' Hymn in the US.\nEarly 1860s.\nThe 1860s were Offenbach's most successful decade. At the beginning of 1860, he was granted French citizenship by the personal command of Napoleon III, and the following year he was appointed a chevalier of the ; this appointment scandalised those members of the musical establishment who resented such an honour for a composer of popular light opera. Offenbach began the decade with his only substantial ballet score, (\"The Butterfly\"), produced at the Op\u00e9ra in 1860. It achieved what was then a successful run of 42 performances, without, as the biographer Andrew Lamb says, \"giving him any greater acceptance in more respectable circles\". Among other operettas in the same year, he finally had a piece presented by the , the three-act . It was not a success; its plot revolved around a dog, and Offenbach attempted canine imitations in his music. Neither the public nor the critics were impressed, and the piece survived for only seven performances.\nApart from that setback, Offenbach flourished in the 1860s, the successes greatly outnumbering the failures. In 1861 he led the company in a summer season in Vienna. Encountering packed houses and enthusiastic reviews, Offenbach found Vienna much to his liking. He even reverted, for a single evening, to his old role as a cello virtuoso at a command performance before Emperor Franz Joseph. That success was followed by a failure in Berlin. Offenbach, though born a Prussian citizen, observed, \"Prussia never does anything to make those of our nationality happy.\" He and the company hastened back to Paris. Meanwhile, among his operettas that season were the full-length and the one-act .\nIn 1862, Offenbach's only son, Auguste (died 1883), was born, the last of five children. In the same year, Offenbach resigned as director of the Bouffes-Parisiens, handing the post over to Alphonse Varney. He continued to write most of his works for the company, with occasional pieces first given at the summer season at Bad Ems. Despite problems with the libretto, Offenbach completed a serious opera in 1864, , a hotchpotch of romantic and mythological themes. The opera was presented with substantial cuts at the Vienna Court Opera and in Cologne in 1865. It was not given again until 2002, when it was finally performed in its entirety. Since then it has been given several productions. It contained one number, the , described by the critic Eduard Hanslick as \"lovely, luring and sensuous\", which Ernest Guiraud later adapted as the Barcarolle in \"The Tales of Hoffmann\". After December 1864, Offenbach wrote less frequently for the Bouffes-Parisiens, and many of his new works premiered at larger theatres.\nLater 1860s.\nBetween 1864 and 1868 Offenbach wrote four of the operettas for which he is chiefly remembered: (1864), (1866), (1867) and (1868). Hal\u00e9vy was joined as librettist for all of them by Henri Meilhac. Offenbach, who called them \"Meil\" and \"Hal\", said of this trinity: a play on words loosely translated as \"I am certainly the Father, but each of them is my Son and Wholly Spirited\".\nFor Offenbach secured Hortense Schneider to play the title role. Since her early success in his short operas, she had become a leading star of the French musical stage. She now commanded large fees and was notoriously temperamental, but Offenbach was adamant that no other singer could match her as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Rehearsals for the premiere at the were tempestuous, with Schneider and the principal mezzo-soprano L\u00e9a Silly feuding, the censor fretting about the satire of the imperial court, and the manager of the theatre attempting to rein in Offenbach's extravagance with production expenses. Once again the success of the piece was inadvertently assured by the critic Janin; his scandalised notice was strongly countered by liberal critics and the ensuing publicity again brought the public flocking.\n was a success in early 1866 and was quickly reproduced elsewhere. later in the same year was a new departure for Offenbach and his librettists; for the first time in a large-scale piece they chose a modern setting, instead of disguising their satire under a classical cloak. It needed no inadvertent boost from Janin but was an instant and prolonged success with Parisian audiences, although its very Parisian themes made it less popular abroad. Gammond describes the libretto as \"almost worthy of [W. S.] Gilbert\", and Offenbach's score as \"certainly his best so far\". The piece starred Zulma Bouffar, who began an affair with the composer that lasted until at least 1875.\nIn 1867 Offenbach had one of his greatest successes. The premiere of , a satire on militarism, took place two days after the opening of the Paris Exhibition, an even greater international draw than the 1855 exhibition which had helped him launch his composing career. The Parisian public and foreign visitors flocked to the new operetta. Sovereigns who saw the piece included King William of Prussia accompanied by his chief minister, Otto von Bismarck. Hal\u00e9vy, with his experience as a senior civil servant, saw the looming threat from Prussia; he wrote in his diary, \"Bismarck is helping to double our takings. This time it's war we're laughing at, and war is at our gates.\" \"La Grande-Duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein\" was followed by a quick succession of modest successes. In 1867 he produced \"Robinson Cruso\u00e9\" and a revised version of \"Genevi\u00e8ve de Brabant\"; in 1868, , and a revised version of .\nIn October 1868 \"La P\u00e9richole\" marked a transition in Offenbach's style, with less exuberant satire and more human romantic interest. Lamb calls it Offenbach's \"most charming\" score. There was some critical grumbling at the change, but the piece, with Schneider in the lead, made a good profit. It was quickly produced elsewhere in Europe and both North and South America. Of the pieces that followed it at the end of the decade, \"Les brigands\" (1869) was another work that leaned more to romantic comic opera than to the more ebullient op\u00e9ra bouffe. It was well received, but has been less often revived than Offenbach's best-known operettas.\nWar and aftermath.\nOffenbach returned hurriedly from a trip to Ems and Wiesbaden just before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. He then went to his home in \u00c9tretat in Normandy and arranged for his family to move to the safety of San Sebasti\u00e1n in northern Spain, joining them shortly afterwards. Having risen to fame under Napoleon III, satirised him, and been rewarded by him, Offenbach was universally associated with the old r\u00e9gime: he was known as \"the mocking-bird of the Second Empire\". When the empire fell in the wake of Prussia's crushing victory at Sedan in September 1870, Offenbach's music was suddenly out of favour. France was swept by violently anti-German sentiments, and despite his French citizenship and , his birth and upbringing in Cologne made him suspect. His operettas were now frequently vilified as the embodiment of everything superficial and worthless in Napoleon III's r\u00e9gime. was banned in France because of its antimilitarist satire.\nAlthough his Parisian audience deserted him, Offenbach had by now become highly popular in London's West End. John Hollingshead of the Gaiety Theatre presented Offenbach's operettas to large and enthusiastic audiences. Between 1870 and 1872, the Gaiety produced fifteen of his works. At the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte presented in 1875. In Vienna, too, Offenbach works were regularly produced. While the war and its aftermath ravaged Paris, the composer supervised Viennese productions and travelled to England as the guest of the Prince of Wales.\nBy the end of 1871 life in Paris had returned to normal, and Offenbach ended his voluntary exile. His new works (1872) and (1873) were modestly profitable, but lavish revivals of his earlier successes did better at the box office. He decided to go back into theatre management and took over the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Ga\u00eet\u00e9 in July 1873. His spectacular revival of there was highly profitable; an attempt to repeat that success with a new, lavish version of proved less popular. Along with the costs of extravagant productions, collaboration with the dramatist Victorien Sardou culminated in financial disaster. An expensive production of Sardou's in 1874, with incidental music by Offenbach, failed to attract the public to the Ga\u00eet\u00e9, and Offenbach was forced to sell his interests in the Ga\u00eet\u00e9 and to mortgage future royalties.\nIn 1876 a successful tour of the US in connection with its Centennial Exhibition enabled Offenbach to recover some of his losses and pay his debts. Beginning with a concert at Gilmore's Garden before a crowd of 8,000 people, he gave a series of more than 40 concerts in New York and Philadelphia. To circumvent a Philadelphia law forbidding entertainments on Sundays, he disguised his operetta numbers as liturgical pieces and advertised a \"Grand Sacred Concert by M. Offenbach\". \" from became a \", and other equally secular numbers were billed as \" or \". The local authorities were not deceived, and withdrew authorisation for the concert at the last minute. At Booth's Theatre, New York, Offenbach conducted and his recent (1873) . He returned to France in July 1876, with profits that were handsome but not spectacular.\nOffenbach's later operettas enjoyed renewed popularity in France, especially (1878), which featured a fantasy plot about the real-life French actress Marie Justine Favart, and (1879), which was the most successful of his operettas of the 1870s.\nLast years.\nProfitable though was, composing it left Offenbach less time to work on his cherished project, the creation of a successful serious opera. Since the beginning of 1877, he had been working when he could on a piece based on a stage play, , by Jules Barbier and Michel Carr\u00e9. Offenbach had suffered from gout since the 1860s, often being carried into the theatre in a chair. Now in failing health, he was conscious of his own mortality and wished passionately to live long enough to complete the opera, (\"The Tales of Hoffmann\"). He was heard saying to Kleinzach, his dog, \"I would give everything I have to be at the premi\u00e8re\". Offenbach did not live to finish the piece. He left the vocal score substantially complete and had made a start on the orchestration. Ernest Guiraud, a family friend, assisted by Offenbach's 18-year-old son Auguste, completed the orchestration, making major changes as well as the substantial cuts demanded by the 's director, Carvalho. The opera was first seen at the on 10 February 1881. Offenbach also left his last comedy, , unfinished; L\u00e9o Delibes orchestrated it and it was given at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance on 30 October 1880.\nOffenbach died in Paris on 5 October 1880 at the age of 61. His cause of death was certified as heart failure brought on by acute gout. He was given a state funeral; \"The Times\" reported, \"The crowd of distinguished men that accompanied him on his last journey amid the general sympathy of the public shows that the late composer was reckoned among the masters of his art.\" He is buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\nWorks.\nIn \"The Musical Times\", Mark Lubbock wrote in 1957:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Offenbach's music is as individually characteristic as that of Delius, Grieg or Puccini \u2013 together with range and variety. He could write straightforward \"singing\" numbers like Paris's song in , [Three goddessess on Mount Ida]; comic songs like General Boum's \"Piff Paff Pouf\" and the ridiculous ensemble at the servants' ball in , [\"Your coat has split down the back\"]. He was a specialist at writing music that had a rapturous, hysterical quality. The famous can-can from has it, and so has the finale of the servants' party\u00a0... which ends with the delirious song . Then, as a contrast, he could compose songs of a simplicity, grace and beauty like the Letter Song from , \"Chanson de Fortunio\", and the Grand Duchess's tender love song to Fritz: .\nAmong other well-known Offenbach numbers are (the Doll Song from \"The Tales of Hoffmann\"); and (); and in , which Lamb notes was Offenbach's last major song for Hortense Schneider.\nOperettas.\nBy his own reckoning, Offenbach composed more than 100 operas. Both the number and the noun are open to question: some works were so extensively revised that he evidently counted the revised versions as new, and commentators generally refer to all but a few of his stage works as operettas, rather than operas. Offenbach reserved the term (English: operetta) or for some of his one-act works, more often using the term for his full-length ones (though there are several one- and two-act examples of this type). It was only with the further development of the genre in Vienna after 1870 that the French term began to be used for works longer than one act. Offenbach also used the term for at least 24 of his works in either one, two or three acts.\nOffenbach's earliest operettas were one-act pieces for small casts. More than 30 of these were presented before his first full-scale \"\", , in 1858, and he composed over twenty more of them during the rest of his career. Lamb, following the precedent of Henseler's 1930 study of the composer, divides the one-act pieces into five categories: (i) country idylls; (ii) urban operettas; (iii) military operettas; (iv) farces; and (v) burlesques or parodies. Offenbach enjoyed his greatest success in the 1860s. His most popular operettas from that decade have remained among his best known.\nTexts and word setting.\nThe first ideas for plots usually came from Offenbach, his librettists working along lines agreed with him. Lamb writes, \"In this respect Offenbach was both well served and skilful at discovering talent. Like Sullivan, and unlike Johann Strauss II, he was consistently blessed with workable subjects and genuinely witty librettos.\" In his setting of his librettists' words he took advantage of the rhythmic flexibility of the French language, and sometimes took this to extremes, forcing words into unnatural stresses. Harding comments that he \"wrought much violence on the French language\". A frequent characteristic of Offenbach's word setting was the nonsensical repetition of isolated syllables of words for comic effect; an example is the quintet for the kings in : \nMusical structure.\nIn general, Offenbach followed simple, established forms. His melodies are usually short and unvaried in their basic rhythm, rarely, in Hughes's words, escaping \"the despotism of the four-bar phrase\". In modulation Offenbach was similarly cautious; he rarely switched a melody to a remote or unexpected key, and kept mostly to a tonic\u2013dominant\u2013subdominant pattern. Within these conventional limits, he employed greater resource in his varied use of rhythm; in a single number he would contrast rapid patter for one singer with a broad, smooth phrase for another, illustrating their different characters. He often switched quickly between major and minor keys, effectively contrasting characters or situations. When he wished to, Offenbach could use unconventional techniques, such as the leitmotif, used throughout to accompany the eponymous Docteur Ox (1877) and to parody Wagner in (1860).\nOrchestration.\nIn his early pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, the size of the orchestra pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of sixteen players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, percussion (including timpani) and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and \u2013 exceptionally, Keck records \u2013 an ophicleide (\"Le Papillon\"), tubular bells (\"Le carnaval des revues\"), and a wind machine (\"Le voyage dans la lune\").\nHughes describes Offenbach's orchestration as \"always skilful, often delicate, and occasionally subtle\". He instances Pluton's song in \"Orph\u00e9e aux enfers\", introduced by a three-bar phrase for solo clarinet and solo bassoon in octaves immediately repeated on solo flute and solo bassoon an octave higher. In Keck's view, \"Offenbach's orchestral scoring is full of details, elaborate counter-voices, minute interactions coloured by interjections of the woodwinds or brass, all of which establish a dialogue with the voices. His refinement of design equals that of Mozart or Rossini.\"\nCompositional method.\nAccording to Keck, Offenbach would first make a note of melodies a libretto suggested to him in a notebook or straight onto the librettist's manuscript. Next using full score manuscript paper he wrote down vocal parts in the centre, then a piano accompaniment at the bottom possibly with notes on orchestration. When Offenbach felt sure the work would be performed, he began full orchestration, often employing a sort of shorthand.\nParody and influences.\nOffenbach was well known for parodying other composers' music. Some of them saw the joke and others did not. Adam, Auber and Meyerbeer enjoyed Offenbach's parodies of their scores. Meyerbeer made a point of attending all Bouffes-Parisiens productions, always seated in Offenbach's private box. Among the composers who were not amused by Offenbach's parodies were Berlioz and Wagner. Offenbach mocked Berlioz's \"strivings after the antique\", and his initial light-hearted satire of Wagner's pretensions later hardened into genuine dislike. Berlioz reacted by bracketing Offenbach and Wagner together as \"the product of the mad German mind\", and Wagner, ignoring Berlioz, retaliated by writing some unflattering verses about Offenbach.\nIn general, Offenbach's parodistic technique was simply to play the original music in unexpected and incongruous circumstances. He slipped the banned revolutionary anthem \"La Marseillaise\" into the chorus of rebellious gods in \"Orph\u00e9e aux enfers\", and quoted the aria from Gluck's \"Orfeo\" in the same work; in he quoted the patriotic trio from Rossini's \"William Tell\" and parodied himself in the ensemble for the kings of Greece, in which the accompaniment quotes the \"rondeau\" from . In his one act pieces, Offenbach parodied Rossini's and familiar arias by Bellini. In \"Croquefer\" (1857), one duet consists of quotations from Hal\u00e9vy's \"La Juive\" and Meyerbeer's \"Robert le diable\" and \"Les Huguenots\". Even in his later, less satirical period, he included a parodic quotation from Donizetti's in .\nOther examples of Offenbach's use of incongruity are noted by the critic Paul Taylor: \"In , the kings of Greece denounce Paris as 'un vil s\u00e9ducteur' [vile seducer] to a waltz tempo that is itself unsuitably seductive\u00a0... the potty-sounding phrase becomes the absurd nucleus of a big cod-ensemble.\" Another lyric set to absurdly ceremonious music is (your coat has split down the back) in \"La vie parisienne\". The Grand Duchess of G\u00e9rolstein's rondo is rhythmically and melodically similar to the finale of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, but it is not clear whether the similarity is parodic or coincidental.\nIn Offenbach's last decade, he took note of a change in public taste: a simpler, more romantic style was now preferred. Harding writes that Lecocq had successfully moved away from satire and parody, returning to \"the genuine spirit of op\u00e9ra-comique and its peculiarly French gaiety\". Offenbach followed suit in a series of twenty operettas; the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida names the finest of these as (1879).\nOther works.\nOf Offenbach's two serious operas, \"Die Rheinnixen\", a failure, was not revived until the 21st century. His second attempt, \"The Tales of Hoffmann\", was originally intended as a grand opera. When the work was accepted by for production at the , Offenbach agreed to make it an with spoken dialogue. It was incomplete when he died; Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet's premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would have been asked to complete the piece and would have done so more satisfactorily. The critic Tim Ashley writes, \"Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences\u00a0... Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann's narrative. Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert.\"\nAlthough he wrote ballet music for dance sequences in many of his operettas, Offenbach wrote only one full-length ballet, . The score was much praised for its orchestration, and it contained one number, the \"Valse des rayons\", that became an international success. Between 1836 and 1875 he composed several individual waltzes and polkas, and suites of dances. They include a waltz, (\"Evening Papers\") composed for Vienna with Johann Strauss's (\"Morning Papers\") as a companion piece. Other orchestral compositions include a piece in 17th-century style with cello solo, which became a standard work of the cello repertoire. Little of Offenbach's non-operatic orchestral music has been regularly performed since his death.\nOffenbach composed more than 50 non-operatic songs between 1838 and 1854, most of them to French texts, by authors including Alfred de Musset, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Jean de La Fontaine, and also ten to German texts. Among the most popular of these songs are \"\" (1843), dedicated to the young H\u00e9rminie d'Alcain as an early token of the composer's love. An Ave Maria for soprano solo was rediscovered at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France in 2000.\nArrangements and editions.\nAlthough the overtures to and are well known and frequently recorded, the scores usually performed and recorded are not by Offenbach, but were arranged from music in the operas by Carl Binder and Eduard Haensch, respectively, for the Vienna premieres of the two works. Offenbach's own preludes are much shorter.\nIn 1938, Manuel Rosenthal assembled the popular ballet from his own orchestral arrangements of melodies from Offenbach's stage works, and in 1953 the same composer assembled a symphonic suite, \"Offenbachiana\", also from music by Offenbach. Jean-Christophe Keck regards the 1938 work as \"no more than a vulgarly orchestrated pastiche\". In Gammond's view it does \"full justice\" to Offenbach.\nEfforts to present critical editions of Offenbach's works have been hampered by the dispersion of his autograph scores to several collections after his death, some of which do not grant access to scholars. Although Auguste catalogued the sketches and manuscripts after his father's death, when the composer's widow died the surviving daughters battled over the papers. Many of his papers may have been lost in the collapse of the city archives in Cologne in 2009.\nLegacy and reputation.\nInfluence.\nOffenbach had a considerable influence on some later French composers, although his immediate successor, Lecocq, strove to distance himself and went out of his way to avoid rhythmic devices familiar from Offenbach's works. Francis Poulenc in his biography of Emmanuel Chabrier wrote that as a great admirer of Offenbach, Chabrier took to imitating him explicitly in some details: \"Hence () is directly derived from in \". Poulenc traces the influence through Chabrier and Andr\u00e9 Messager to his own music. The composer and musicologist Wilfrid Mellers finds music modelled on Offenbach's in Poulenc's .\nThe musician and author Fritz Spiegl wrote in 1980, \"Without Offenbach there would have been no Savoy Opera\u00a0... no or \"Merry Widow\"\". The two creators of the Savoy operas \u2013 the librettist, Gilbert, and the composer, Sullivan \u2013 were both indebted to Offenbach and his partners for their satiric and musical styles, even borrowing plot components. For example, Faris argues that the mock-oriental \"Ba-ta-clan\" influenced \"The Mikado\", including its character names, Offenbach's Ko-ko-ri-ko and Gilbert's Ko-Ko. The best-known instance in which a Savoy opera draws on Offenbach's work is \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (1879), where both Gilbert and Sullivan follow the lead of (1869) in their treatment of the police, who plod along ineffectually in heavy march-time. was presented in London in 1871, 1873 and 1875; before the first of these, Gilbert made an English translation of Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy's libretto.\nHowever much the young Sullivan was influenced by Offenbach, the influence was evidently not in only one direction. Hughes observes that two numbers in Offenbach's (1878) bear \"an astonishing resemblance\" to \"My name is John Wellington Wells\" from Gilbert and Sullivan's \"The Sorcerer\" (1877).\nOffenbach's popularity with Viennese audiences led composers there to follow his lead. He encouraged Johann Strauss to turn to operetta when they met in Vienna in 1864, but it was not until seven years later that Strauss did so. In his first successful operetta, (1874), and its successors, Strauss worked on the lines developed by his Parisian colleague. The libretto for was adapted from a play by Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy, and the operetta specialist Richard Traubner comments that Strauss was influenced by \"the two brilliant party scenes\" in Offenbach's . A leading Viennese critic demanded that composers \"remain within the realm of pure operetta, a rule strictly observed by Offenbach\", and among Strauss's later stage works was \"Prinz Methusalem\" (1877), described by Lamb as \"a satirical Offenbachian piece\".\nIn Gammond's view, the Viennese composer most influenced by Offenbach was Franz von Supp\u00e9, who studied Offenbach's works carefully and wrote many successful operettas using them as a model. Traubner writes that Supp\u00e9's early works frankly imitated Offenbach's, and his operas \u2013 and Strauss's \u2013 were \"unmistakably Parisian (as much derived from Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy as from Offenbach)\". Supp\u00e9's (The Boarding School, 1860) not only emulates Offenbach, but refers to him in the first act, when the heroine, the schoolgirl Sophie, and her friends learn about the can-can and proceed to dance it. Supp\u00e9's most enduring one-act success, (The Beautiful Galatea, 1865), was modelled, in both title and style, on Offenbach's which had been a great success in Vienna earlier that year.\nIn the \"Cambridge Opera Journal\" in 2014 the musicologist Micaela Baranello writes that Franz Leh\u00e1r's operettas have a strong Offenbachian element, alongside what she calls a \"folksy, imaginary\" one. She cites eight numbers in \"The Merry Widow\" as in the Parisian tradition, including \"the percussive nonsense syllables familiar from Offenbach\". Elsewhere in Europe, Offenbach was an important influence on the development of zarzuela in Spain, and the 20th-century German composer Kurt Weill described his own (Cattle Trading) as \"an operetta influenced by Offenbach\".\nIn his 1957 article, Lubbock wrote, \"Offenbach is undoubtedly the most significant figure in the history of the 'musical'\", and traced the development of musical theatre from Offenbach via Sullivan, Leh\u00e1r, Messager and Lionel Monckton to Irving Berlin and Rodgers and Hammerstein. Lamb writes, \"During the nineteenth century the works of Offenbach, Johann Strauss, and Gilbert and Sullivan had scarcely less success in the New World than in the Old\", and according to the historian Adrian Wright the 1858 New York premiere of made Offenbach \"a Broadway constant\", putting his works in vogue in America until the end of the century. He influenced some American composers such as John Philip Sousa in his operetta \"El Capitan\" (1896). Sousa's contemporary, David Braham, was dubbed \"the American Offenbach\", and included phrases from Offenbach's scores in his own music. Later, Lamb finds echoes of \"La Vie parisienne\" in Cole Porter's \"Fifty Million Frenchmen\" (1929), although the influence in that case is more that of Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy than of Offenbach. In a 2005 study of Lerner and Loewe, Gene Lees writes, \"The wellspring of the American musical is to be found in the op\u00e9ra-bouffe of Jacques Offenbach\", and Alan Jay Lerner said that Offenbach \"was indeed the father of us all\".\nReputation.\nDuring Offenbach's lifetime, and in the obituary notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed \"Musical Snobs Ltd\" by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation. In a 1980 article in \"The Musical Times\", George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten. Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in \"The Times\", Francis Hueffer wrote, \"none of his numerous Parisian imitators has ever been able to rival Offenbach at his best\". Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: \"It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive.\" \"The New York Times\" shared this view: \"That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied, but he wrote , and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation\". After the posthumous production of \"The Tales of Hoffmann\", \"The Times\" partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, \" [will] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer in every sense of the word\". It then lapsed into what Gammond calls \"Victorian sanctimoniousness\" by taking it for granted that the opera \"will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory\".\nThe philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called Offenbach both an \"artistic genius\" and a \"clown\", but wrote that \"nearly every one\" of Offenbach's works achieves half a dozen \"moments of wanton perfection\". The novelist \u00c9mile Zola commented on Offenbach in an essay, \"La f\u00e9erie et l'op\u00e9rette IV/V\". While granting that Offenbach's best operettas are full of grace, charm and wit, Zola blames him for what others have made of the genre. Zola calls operetta a \"public enemy\" and a \"monstrous beast\". Some critics saw the satire in Offenbach's works as a social protest, an attack against the establishment, but Zola saw the works as a homage to the social system in the Second Empire.\nThe mid-20th-century critic Sacheverell Sitwell compared Offenbach's lyrical and comic gifts to those of Mozart and Rossini. Otto Klemperer, although best known as a conductor of the German symphonic classics, was an admirer of Offenbach; late in life he reflected: \"At the Kroll [in 1931] we did . That's a really delightful score. So is \"Orpheus in the Underworld\" and . Those who called him 'The Mozart of the Boulevards' were not much mistaken\". Debussy, Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov loved Offenbach's operettas. Debussy rated them higher than \"The Tales of Hoffmann\": \"The one work in which [Offenbach] tried to be serious met with no success.\" He wrote this in 1903, when \"The Tales of Hoffmann\", after initial success, with 101 performances in its first year, had become neglected. A production by Thomas Beecham at His Majesty's Theatre, London, in 1910 restored the work to the mainstream operatic repertoire, where it has remained. A London critic wrote, on Offenbach's death, \"I somewhere read that some of Offenbach's latest work shows him to be capable of more ambitious work. I, for one, am glad he did what he did, and only wish he had done more of the same kind.\" In \"Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians\", Lamb writes:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;His opera has retained a place in the international repertory, but his most significant achievements lie in the field of operetta. and remain outstanding examples of the French and international operetta repertory.\nNotes and references.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nSources.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}
{"id": "65415", "revid": "372290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65415", "title": "Georges Feydeau", "text": "French playwright (1862\u20131921)\nGeorges-L\u00e9on-Jules-Marie Feydeau (; 8 December 1862 \u2013 5 June 1921) was a French playwright of the Belle \u00c9poque era, remembered for his farces, written between 1886 and 1914.\nFeydeau was born in Paris to middle-class parents and raised in an artistic and literary environment. From an early age he was fascinated by the theatre, and as a child he wrote plays and organised his schoolfellows into a drama group. In his teens he wrote comic monologues and moved on to writing longer plays. His first full-length comedy, \"Tailleur pour dames\" ('Ladies' tailor'), was well received, but was followed by a string of comparative failures. He gave up writing for a time in the early 1890s and studied the methods of earlier masters of French comedy, particularly Eug\u00e8ne Labiche, Alfred Hennequin and Henri Meilhac. With his technique honed, and sometimes in collaboration with a co-author, he wrote seventeen full-length plays between 1892 and 1914, many of which have become staples of the theatrical repertoire in France and abroad. They include ('The Free Exchange Hotel', 1894), \"La Dame de chez Maxim\" ('The lady from Maxim's', 1899), \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\" ('A flea in her ear', 1907) and \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" ('Look after Am\u00e9lie', 1908).\nThe plays of Feydeau are marked by closely observed characters, with whom his audiences could identify, plunged into fast-moving comic plots of mistaken identity, attempted adultery, split-second timing and a precariously happy ending. After the great success they enjoyed in his lifetime they were neglected after his death, until the 1940s and 1950s, when productions by Jean-Louis Barrault and the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise led a revival of interest in his works, at first in Paris and subsequently worldwide.\nFeydeau's personal life was marred by depression, unsuccessful gambling and divorce. In 1919 his mental condition deteriorated sharply and he spent his final two years in a sanatorium at Rueil (now Rueil-Malmaison), near Paris. He died there in 1921 at the age of fifty-eight.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:TOC limit/styles.css\" /&gt;\nLife and career.\nEarly years.\nFeydeau was born at his parents' house in the Rue de Clichy, Paris, on 8 December 1862. His father, Ernest-Aim\u00e9 Feydeau, was a financier and a moderately well-known writer, whose first novel \"Fanny\" (1858) was a \"succ\u00e8s de scandale\" and earned him some notoriety. It was condemned from the pulpit by the Archbishop of Paris, and consequently sold in large numbers and had to be reprinted; Ernest dedicated the new edition to the archbishop.\nFeydeau's mother was Lodzia Bogaslawa, \"n\u00e9e\" Zelewska, known as \"L\u00e9ocadie\". When she married Ernest Feydeau in 1861, he was a forty-year-old childless widower and she was twenty-two. She was a famous beauty, and rumours spread that she was the mistress of the Duc de Morny or even the Emperor Napoleon III and that one of them was the father of Georges, her first child. In later life L\u00e9ocadie commented, \"How can anyone be stupid enough to believe that a boy as intelligent as Georges is the son of that idiotic emperor!\" She was more equivocal about her relationship with the duke, and Georges later said that people could think Morny his father if they wanted to.\nErnest was a friend of Gustave Flaubert, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier and Alexandre Dumas \"fils\", and Feydeau grew up in a literary and artistic environment. After being taken to the theatre at the age of six or seven he was so enthusiastic that he started to write a play of his own. His father, impressed, told the family's governess to let the boy off tuition that day. Feydeau later said that laziness made him a playwright, once he found he could escape lessons by writing plays. He sought out Henri Meilhac, one of the leading dramatists in Paris, and showed him his latest effort. He recalled Meilhac as saying, \"My boy, your play is stupid, but it is theatrical. You will be a man of the theatre\".\nAfter the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 the family left Paris for Boulogne-sur-Mer. They returned briefly to Paris in March 1871 and then moved to the spa town of Bad Homburg so that Ernest, whose health was failing, could take the cure. Soon after their return to Paris in October 1871 the nine-year-old Feydeau, who had so far received only private tuition, was sent to a boarding school. As a pupil he was generally indolent, but devoted time and energy to organising an amateur dramatic group and performing. In October 1873 Ernest died and in 1876 L\u00e9ocadie remarried. Her second husband, nearer her own age than Ernest, was a prominent liberal journalist, Henry Fouquier (1838\u20131901), with whom Feydeau got on well. In 1879 Feydeau completed his formal education at the Lyc\u00e9e Saint-Louis, and was engaged as a clerk in a law firm. Still stage-struck, he began writing again. Comic monologues were fashionable in society, and he wrote \"La Petite r\u00e9volt\u00e9e\" (The rebellious young lady), a humorous monologue in verse, of about seven minutes' duration, which attracted favourable attention and was taken up by the publisher Ollendorff.\n1880s.\nThe first of Feydeau's plays to be staged was a one-act two-hander called \"Par la fen\u00eatre\" (Through the window) presented by the \"Cercle des arts intimes\", an amateur society, in June 1882. In his biography of Feydeau Henry Gidel comments that it was not a representative audience, being composed of friends of society members, but it was nonetheless a test of a sort, and the play was enthusiastically received. The typical Feydeau characters and plot were already in evidence: a shy husband, a domineering wife, mistaken identities, confusion and a happy ending. The first professional presentation of a Feydeau play was in January 1883, when \"Amour et piano\" was staged at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e. It depicts the confusion arising when a young lady receives a young gentleman who she thinks is her new piano teacher; he has come to the wrong house and believes he is calling on a glamorous cocotte. \"Le Figaro\" called it \"a very witty fantasy, very agreeably interpreted\".\nAfter completing his compulsory military service (1883\u201384) Feydeau was appointed \"secr\u00e9taire g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" to the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance, under the management of his friend Fernand Samuel. In that capacity he successfully pressed for the premiere of Henry Becque's \"La Parisienne\" (1885), later recognised as one of the masterpieces of French naturalist theatre. In December 1886 the Renaissance presented a three-act com\u00e9die by Feydeau, \"Tailleur pour dames\" (Ladies' tailor). \"Les Annales du th\u00e9\u00e2tre et de la musique\" thought the play insubstantial, but, it enthused, \"what gaiety in the dialogue, what good humour, what pleasing words, what fun in this childishness, what unforeseen things in this madness, what comic invention in this imbroglio, which obtained the most outright success one could wish to a beginner!\" The critic of \"Le Figaro\" said that the piece was not a comedy at all in the conventional sense of the word:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;It doesn't look like anything and it looks like everything. It's made of everything, and it's made of nothing. And it is comic, it is funny! I laughed at it from ten o'clock to midnight. I laughed about it throughout the journey from the theatre to \"Le Figaro\". And I am still laughing about it.\nThe critic Jules Pr\u00e9vel correctly predicted that the young author would struggle to repeat this early triumph: it was not until 1892 that Feydeau had another success to match \"Tailleur pour dames\". He had a series of poor or mediocre runs in the late 1880s with \"La Lyc\u00e9enne\" (a \"vaudeville-op\u00e9rette\" with music by Gaston Serpette, 1887), (1888), \"Les Fianc\u00e9s de Loches\" (1888 co-written with Maurice Desvalli\u00e8res), and \"L'Affaire Edouard\" (1889).\nIn 1889 Feydeau married Marie-Anne, the daughter of Carolus-Duran, a prosperous portrait painter. The couple had four children, born between 1890 and 1903. The marriage was ideal to Feydeau in several ways. It was a genuine love-match (though it later went awry); he was an ardent amateur painter, and his father-in-law gave him lessons; and marriage into a well-to-do family relieved Feydeau of some of the financial problems arising from his succession of theatrical failures and heavy losses on the stock exchange.\n1890s.\nIn 1890 Feydeau took a break from writing and made a study of the works of the leading comic playwrights, particularly Eug\u00e8ne Labiche, Alfred Hennequin and Meilhac. He benefited from his study, and in 1891 wrote two plays that restored his reputation and fortune. He submitted them both to the management of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal. They agreed to stage one of them, \"Monsieur chasse!\", but turned down the second, \"Champignol malgr\u00e9 lui\" (another collaboration with Desvalli\u00e8res) as too unbelievable for an audience to accept. After receiving this news from the Palais-Royal, Feydeau met an old friend, Henri Micheau, the owner of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Nouveaut\u00e9s, who insisted on seeing the rejected script and immediately recognised it as a potential winner. Meyer writes, \"He was right. \"Monsieur chasse!\" was a success, but \"Champignol\" was a triumph\". When the play opened in November 1892 one critic wrote of:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\u2026 a vaudeville so extremely bright and joyous, and at the same time so irreproachable in its atmosphere, that it obtained an extraordinary success by reason of a kind of mad gaiety which characterized it.\u00a0... I have never seen an audience give itself up more completely or continuously to unbridled hilarity.\nAnother critic said that it had been years since he heard such laughter in a Paris theatre \u2013 \"I could return to it again and again with pleasure\". He predicted that the piece \"will have an interminable run\", and it ran far into the following year for a total of 434 performances. An English version of the play, called \"The Other Fellow\" opened in London in September 1893 and ran for three months. Feydeau's next play, \"Le Syst\u00e8me Ribadier\" (The Ribadier System, 1892), had a fair run in Paris and was successfully produced in Berlin, and subsequently (under the title \"His Little Dodge\") in London and New York.\nIn 1894 Feydeau collaborated with Desvalli\u00e8res on \"Le Ruban\" (The ribbon), a comedy about a man desperately manoeuvring for appointment to the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. At the same time, after a certain amount of similar manoeuvring on his own account, Feydeau was appointed to the legion, at the early age of thirty-two, joining a small \u00e9lite of French playwrights to receive the honour, including Dumas, Meilhac, Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy, Victorien Sardou and Becque.\n \"Le Ruban\" ran at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on for 45 performances. Feydeau and Desvalli\u00e8res returned to winning form in the same year with (The Free Exchange Hotel). The \"Annales du th\u00e9\u00e2tre et de la musique\", noting that the laughter reverberated inside and out of the auditorium, said that a reviewer could only laugh and applaud rather than criticise. Another critic, predicting a long run, wrote that he and his colleagues would not be needed at the Nouveaut\u00e9s in their professional capacities for a year or so, but would know where to come if they wanted to laugh. The play ran for 371 performances. An English adaptation, \"The Gay Parisians\", was staged in New York in September 1895, and ran for nearly 150 performances; a London version, \"A Night in Paris\", opened in April 1896 and outran the Parisian original, with a total of 531 performances.\nDuring the rest of the 1890s there were two more Feydeau plays, both highly successful. \"Le Dindon\" (literally \"Turkey\" but in French usage signifying \"Dupe\" or \"Fall guy\") ran for 275 performances at the Palais-Royale in 1896\u201397, and at the end of the decade Feydeau had the best run of his career with \"La Dame de chez Maxim\", which played at the Nouveaut\u00e9s from January 1899 to November 1900, a total of 579 performances. The author was used to working with and writing for established farceurs such as Alexandre Germain, who starred in many of his plays from \"Champignol malgr\u00e9 lui\" (1892) to \"On purge b\u00e9b\u00e9!\" (1910); for \"La Dame de chez Maxim\" Feydeau discovered Armande Cassive, whom he moulded into his ideal leading lady for his later works.\n1900\u20131909.\nThe Feydeaus' marriage, happy for its first decade or so, had begun to go wrong by the early years of the 20th century. Feydeau gambled and lost large sums and in 1901 had to sell some of his valuable art collection; his wife was said to have become bitter and spendthrift. Finance became a continual problem. Feydeau never regained the success he had enjoyed with \"La Dame de chez Maxim\". A collaboration in 1902 with the composer Alfred Kaiser on a serious romantic opera, \"Le Billet de Jos\u00e9phine\", was not a success, closing after 16 performances. Of his first four plays of the 1900s, only \"La Main passe!\" (1904) had a substantial run. \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\" (A flea in her ear) (1907) won glowing reviews, and seemed set to become one of the author's biggest box-office successes, but after 86 performances a leading member of the cast, the much loved comic actor Joseph Torin, died suddenly and the play was withdrawn; it was not seen again in Paris until 1952.\nIn 1908 \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" (Look after Am\u00e9lie) opened at the Nouveaut\u00e9s. The reviewers were enthusiastic; in \"Le Figaro\", Emmanuel Ar\u00e8ne said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt; \nIn \"Les Annales du th\u00e9\u00e2tre et de la musique\" Edmond Stoullig wrote:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;The mighty, yes the mighty, vaudevillist who is M. Georges Feydeau! Ah, the hilarious farce, first cousin of the \"Lady from Maxim's\", and destined, like her, to attract legions of spectators to the Nouveaut\u00e9s \u2026 laughing out loud, as we did without constraint and shamelessly.\nThe piece ran for 288 performances at the Nouveaut\u00e9s during 1908\u201309, and at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Antoine for 96 performances later in 1909.\nLast years.\nIn 1909, after a particularly acrimonious quarrel, Feydeau left home and moved into the Hotel Terminus in the Rue Saint-Lazare. He lived there, surrounded by his paintings and books, until 1919. He and Marie-Anne were divorced in 1916 and in 1918, now aged fifty-five, he embarked on an affair with a young dancer, Odette Darthys, whom he cast in the lead in revivals of his plays.\n\"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" was the last full-length play Feydeau wrote on his own. \"Le Circuit\" (The road race, 1909) with Francis de Croisset made little impact. \"Je ne trompe pas mon mari\" (I don't cheat on my husband, 1914) with Ren\u00e9 Peter did well at the box office, with 200 performances, but in the view of Feydeau's biographer Leonard Pronko it has signs that \"the dramatist had almost reached the end of his brilliant inventiveness\". From 1908 Feydeau focused chiefly on a series of one-act plays, which he envisaged as a set to be called \"Du mariage au divorce\" (From marriage to divorce). Pronko describes the last of these, \"Hortense a dit: \"je m'en fous!\"\" (\"Hortense says 'I don't give a damn'\", 1916) \"astringently funny \u2026 Feydeau's last dazzling gasp\".\nFeydeau had long been subject to depression, but in mid-1919 his family, alarmed at signs of a severe deterioration in his mental condition, called in medical experts; the diagnosis was dementia caused by tertiary syphilis. The condition was incurable, and Feydeau's sons arranged for him to be admitted to the Sanatorium de la Malmaison, a leading sanatorium at Rueil (present-day, Rueil-Malmaison). He spent his last two years there, imagining himself to be Napoleon III appointing ministers and issuing invitations to his coronation.\nFeydeau sank into a coma and died in the sanatorium at Rueil on 5 June 1921, aged fifty-eight. After a funeral at Sainte-Trinit\u00e9, Paris, he was buried in the Montmartre Cemetery.\nWorks.\nFeydeau wrote more than twenty comic monologues, and provided librettos for the composers Gaston Serpette, Alfred Kaiser and Louis Varney, but his reputation rests on those of his plays known in English as farces. He did not use that term for any of his works: he called them vaudevilles or com\u00e9dies. The vaudeville, a genre that originated in the middle ages as a satirical song, evolved into a play in verse with music, and by Feydeau's time had split into two branches: op\u00e9rettes, such as those by Offenbach, and, in the words of the writer Peter Meyer, \"the vaudeville itself\u00a0... akin to what we would call slapstick farce, where movement was more important than character\". Reviewers in the French press in Feydeau's time used both terms \u2013\"vaudeville\" and \"farce\" \u2013 to label his plays.\nBetween 1878 and 1916 Feydeau completed twenty full-length and nineteen one-act plays. Eleven of them were written with a co-author, and not all were farcical; \"Le Ruban\" (The ribbon, 1894, in collaboration with Maurice Desvalli\u00e8res), is a comedy about a man's strenuous efforts to gain a state honour, and \"Le Bourgeon\" (The bud) is a comedy of manners with serious moments. The latter had a respectable run of 92 performances, but Feydeau's greatest successes were in farce. He said that he made so much money from \"La Dame de chez Maxim\" that he could afford to take two years' break from writing and devote himself instead to his hobby, painting. That play remains a favourite with French audiences; in English-speaking countries \"A Flea in Her Ear\" became the most popular.\nFarcical style.\nThe critic S. Beynon John contrasts Feydeau's farce with that of the English theatre of the same period \u2013 the latter \"cosy and genial\", and Feydeau's \"sharply subversive\". John also contrasts Feydeau with the earlier French farceur, Eug\u00e8ne Labiche: \"Labiche's world, though fantasticated, is rooted in ordinary life; Feydeau's is cruel, claustrophobic, and smacks of mania\". Discussing his technique, Feydeau said, \"When I sit down to write a play I identify those characters who have every reason to avoid each other; and I make it my business to bring them together as soon, and as often, as I can.\" He also said that to make people laugh \"you have to place ordinary people in a dramatic situation and then observe them from a comic angle, but they must never be allowed to say or do anything which is not strictly demanded, first by their character and secondly by the plot\". Although in private life he was known for his wit, he carefully avoided it in his plays, holding that witty theatrical dialogue interrupted the action.\nThe critic W. D. Howarth sums up Feydeau's typical dramatic template as \"a nightmare sequence of events in otherwise unremarkable lives\". In general the vaudeville or farcical events are confined to the second of three acts:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Block indent/styles.css\"/&gt;\nHowarth observes that \"The nightmare quality of Feydeau's middle acts\" depends not only on \"frenzied comings and goings\", but also on mechanical stage accessories such as the revolving bed in \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\", which conveys its occupants into the adjoining room, seemingly at random.\nWhen Feydeau took a break from writing to study the works of his most successful predecessors, he focused in particular on three playwrights: Labiche, Hennequin and Meilhac. From Labiche he learned the importance of close observation of real-life characters, lending verisimilitude to the most chaotic situations. From Hennequin \u2013 who had started as an engineer \u2013 Feydeau drew the intricate plotting, described by Pronko as \"endless mazes of crisscrossing couples, scurrying from door to door, room to room in every possible and impossible combination\". From Meilhac he learned the art of writing polished dialogue, sounding elegant but natural. From these three influences, Feydeau fashioned what Pronko calls \"the last great masterpieces of the vaudeville form\".\nContemporary opinions of Feydeau covered a wide range. Catulle Mend\u00e8s wrote, \"I continue to deplore the fact that M. Georges Feydeau uses his truly remarkable talent on plays that will be performed four or five hundred times but that will never be read\". For some, his late one-act plays are misogynistic; for others, they were his finest achievements, comparable with Strindberg in their naturalism; Feydeau was seen here as a moralist as well as an entertainer. For the authors of \"Les Annales du th\u00e9\u00e2tre et de la musique\", and critics in \"Le Figaro\" his farces were what made Feydeau incomparable. Later critics including Gidel, Pronko, Marcel Achard and Kenneth Tynan have judged that in his farces Feydeau was second only to Moli\u00e8re as France's great comic dramatist.\nOne-act pieces.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nMonologues.\nFor male performer.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Col-begin/styles.css\"/&gt;\nLegacy.\nAfter his death Feydeau's plays were neglected for many years. It was not until the 1940s that major revivals were staged in Paris, after which Feydeau gradually became a staple of the repertory in France and abroad. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise admitted a Feydeau work to its repertoire for the first time in 1941, with a production of the one-act \"Feu la m\u00e8re de Madame\", directed by Fernand Ledoux, starring Madeleine Renaud and Pierre Bertin. At the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny in 1948 Renaud starred in the first production of \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" since Feydeau's 1908 original, with the company she co-founded with Jean-Louis Barrault. They took the production to Broadway in 1952, and the West End in 1956, playing in the original French and gaining enthusiastic reviews from the New York and London critics. In the meanwhile the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise staged its first full-length Feydeau production, \"Le Dindon\" (1951). English adaptations had been familiar in Feydeau's day, and in the 1950s new versions began to appear, including Peter Glenville's \"Hotel Paradiso\" (1956, from ) and No\u00ebl Coward's \"Look After Lulu!\" (1959, from \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\"); both were seen in the West End and on Broadway.\nThe 1960s saw two celebrated productions by Jacques Charon. The first was \"Un Fil \u00e0 la patte\" (1961) for the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, which the company took to London in 1964. This led to an invitation from Laurence Olivier to Charon to direct John Mortimer's adaptation of \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\" as \"A Flea in Her Ear\" for the National Theatre (1966). Charon followed this with Mortimer's version of \"Un Fil \u00e0 la patte\" (\"Cat Among the Pigeons\") in the West End (1969). In the 1970s the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise added two more Feydeau plays to its repertoire: \"Mais n'te prom\u00e8ne donc pas toute nue!\" (1971) and \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\" (1978), both directed by Jean-Laurent Cochet. In New York there were productions of \"Le Dindon\" (1972 as \"There's One in Every Marriage\"), \"La Main passe\" (1973 as \"Chemin de fer\"), and \"Monsieur chasse!\" (1978, as \"13 rue de l'amour\"). In London the National Theatre presented a second Mortimer adaptation, \"The Lady from Maxim's\" (1977).\nDuring the last two decades of the twentieth century interest in Feydeau continued. The Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise presented four more of his plays: \"La Dame de chez Maxim\" (1981) directed by Jean-Paul Roussillon, \"L\u00e9onie est en avance\" (1985) directed by Stuart Seide, \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" (1995) directed by Roger Planchon, and \"Chat en poche\" (1998) directed by Muriel Mayette. There were numerous Feydeau revivals in theatres in Paris, cities across France, and Brussels, including seven productions of \"Le Syst\u00e8me Ribadier\" three of \"Monsieur chasse!\", five of \"La Dame de chez Maxim\", and four of \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\". In London the National Theatre presented Mortimer's adaptation of \"L'H\u00f4tel du libre-\u00e9change\" (1984, as \"A Little Hotel on the Side\"), which was later played on Broadway. Other English adaptations included Peter Hall and Nicki Frei's versions of \"Le Dindon\" (1994, as \"An Absolute Turkey\") and \"Occupe-toi d'Am\u00e9lie!\" (1996, as \"Mind Millie for Me\").\nDuring the first two decades of the 21st century, the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise presented seven Feydeau productions: \"Le Dindon\" (2002, directed by Lukas Hemleb), \"Un Fil \u00e0 la patte\" (2010 J\u00e9r\u00f4me Deschamps), \"Quatre pi\u00e8ces\" \u2013 a quadruple bill of one-act plays and a monologue (\"Amour et Piano\", \"Un monsieur qui n'aime pas les monologues\", \"Fianc\u00e9s en herbe\" and \"Feu la m\u00e8re de madame\", 2009, Gian Manuel Rau), \"Le Cercle des castagnettes\" (monologues, 2012, Alain Fran\u00e7on), \"Le Syst\u00e8me Ribadier\" (2013, Zabou Breitman), \"L'H\u00f4tel du libre-\u00e9change\" (2017, Isabelle Nanty) and \"La Puce \u00e0 l'oreille\" (2019, Lilo Baur). The Internet Broadway Database records no Feydeau productions in the 21st century. Among British productions were Frei's 2003 version of \"Le Syst\u00e8me Rebadier\" (as \"Where There's a Will\") directed by Hall and Mortimer's \"A Flea in Her Ear\", revived at the Old Vic in 2010, directed by Richard Eyre.\nAdaptations.\nSeveral of Feydeau's plays have been adapted for the cinema and television. Although he was active well into the early years of film he never wrote for the medium, but within two years of his death in 1921 other writers and directors began to take his plays as the basis for films, of which more than twenty have been made, in several countries and languages. At least fourteen of his plays have been adapted for television.\nNotes, references and sources.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65417", "revid": "9021902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65417", "title": "String quartet", "text": "Musical ensemble of four string players\nThe term string quartet is a type of musical composition or a group of four people who play them. Many composers from the mid-18th century onwards wrote string quartets. The associated musical ensemble consists of two violinists, a violist, and a cellist.\nThe string quartet was developed into its present form by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn, whose works in the 1750s established the ensemble as a group of four more-or-less equal partners. Since that time, the string quartet has been considered a prestigious form; writing for four instruments with broadly similar characteristics both constrains and tests a composer. String quartet composition flourished in the Classical era, and Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert each wrote a number of them. Many Romantic and early-twentieth-century composers composed string quartets, including Mendelssohn, Schumann, Brahms, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Jan\u00e1\u010dek, and Debussy. There was a slight lull in string quartet composition later in the 19th century, but it received a resurgence in the 20th century, with the Second Viennese School, Bart\u00f3k, Shostakovich, Babbitt, and Carter producing highly regarded examples of the genre, and it remains an important and refined musical form.\nThe standard structure for a string quartet as established in the Classical era is four movements, with the first movement in sonata form, allegro, in the tonic key; a slow movement in a related key and a minuet and trio follow; and the fourth movement is often in rondo form or sonata rondo form, in the tonic key.\nSome string quartet ensembles play together for many years and become established and promoted as an entity in a manner similar to an instrumental soloist or an orchestra.\nHistory and development.\nEarly history.\nThe early history of the string quartet is in many ways the history of the development of the genre by the Austrian composer Joseph Haydn. There had been examples of divertimenti for two solo violins, viola and cello by the Viennese composers Georg Christoph Wagenseil and Ignaz Holzbauer; and there had long been a tradition of performing orchestral works one instrument to a part. The British musicologist David Wyn Jones cites the widespread practice of four players, one to a part, playing works written for string orchestra, such as divertimenti and serenades, there being no separate (fifth) contrabass part in string scoring before the 19th century. However, these composers showed no interest in exploring the development of the string quartet as a medium.\nThe origins of the string quartet can be further traced back to the Baroque trio sonata, in which two solo instruments performed with a continuo section consisting of a bass instrument (such as the cello) and keyboard. A very early example is a four-part sonata for string ensemble by the Italian composer Gregorio Allegri that might be considered an important prototype. By the early 18th century, composers were often adding a third soloist; and moreover it became common to omit the keyboard part, letting the cello support the bass line alone. Thus when Alessandro Scarlatti wrote a set of six works entitled (Sonata for four instruments: two violins, viola, and cello without harpsichord), this was a natural evolution from the existing tradition.\nHaydn's impact.\nThe musicologist Hartmut Schick has suggested that Franz Xaver Richter invented the \"classical\" string quartet around 1757, but the consensus amongst most authorities is that Haydn is responsible for the genre in its currently accepted form. The string quartet enjoyed no recognized status as an ensemble in the way that two violins with basso continuo \u2013 the so-called 'trio sonata' \u2013 had for more than a hundred years. Even the composition of Haydn's earliest string quartets owed more to chance than artistic imperative. \nDuring the 1750s, when the young composer was still working mainly as a teacher and violinist in Vienna, he would occasionally be invited to spend time at the nearby castle at Weinzierl of the music-loving Austrian nobleman Karl Joseph Weber, Edler von F\u00fcrnberg. There he would play chamber music in an \"ad hoc\" ensemble consisting of F\u00fcrnberg's steward, a priest, and a local cellist, and when the Baron asked for some new music for the group to play, Haydn's first string quartets were born. It is not clear whether any of these works ended up in the two sets published in the mid-1760s and known as Haydn's Opp. 1 and 2 ('Op. 0' is a quartet included in some early editions of Op. 1, and only rediscovered in the 1930s), but it seems reasonable to assume that they were at least similar in character.\nHaydn's early biographer Georg August Griesinger tells the story thus:\nThe following purely chance circumstance had led him to try his luck at the composition of quartets. A Baron F\u00fcrnberg had a place in Weinzierl, several stages from Vienna, and he invited from time to time his pastor, his manager, Haydn, and Albrechtsberger (a brother of the celebrated contrapuntist Albrechtsberger) in order to have a little music. F\u00fcrnberg requested Haydn to compose something that could be performed by these four amateurs. Haydn, then eighteen years old [\"sic\"], took up this proposal, and so originated his first quartet which, immediately it appeared, received such general approval that Haydn took courage to work further in this form.\nHaydn went on to write nine other quartets around this time. These works were published as his Op. 1 and Op. 2; one quartet went unpublished, and some of the early \"quartets\" are actually symphonies missing their wind parts. They have five movements and take the form: fast movement, minuet and trio I, slow movement, minuet and trio II, and fast finale. As Ludwig Finscher notes, they draw stylistically on the Austrian divertimento tradition.\nAfter these early efforts, Haydn did not return to the string quartet for several years, but when he did so, it was to make a significant step in the genre's development. The intervening years saw Haydn begin his employment as Kapellmeister to the Esterh\u00e1zy princes, for whom he was required to compose numerous symphonies and dozens of trios for violin, viola, and the bass instrument called the baryton (played by Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy himself). The opportunities for experiment which both these genres offered Haydn perhaps helped him in the pursuit of the more advanced quartet style found in the eighteen works published in the early 1770s as Opp. 9, 17, and 20. These are written in a form that became established as standard both for Haydn and for other composers. Clearly composed as sets, these quartets feature a four-movement layout having broadly conceived, moderately paced first movements and, in increasing measure, a democratic and conversational interplay of parts, close-knit thematic development, and skillful though often restrained use of counterpoint. The convincing realizations of the progressive aims of the Op. 20 set of 1772, in particular, makes them the first major peak in the history of the string quartet. Certainly they offered to their own time state-of-the art models to follow for the best part of a decade; the teenage Mozart, in his early quartets, was among the composers moved to imitate many of their characteristics, right down to the vital fugues with which Haydn sought to bring greater architectural weight to the finales of nos. 2, 5 and 6.\nAfter Op. 20, it becomes harder to point to similar major jumps in the string quartet's development in Haydn's hands, though not due to any lack of invention or application on the composer's part. As Donald Tovey put it: \"with Op. 20 the historical development of Haydn's quartets reaches its goal; and further progress is not progress in any historical sense, but simply the difference between one masterpiece and the next.\"\nThe musicologist Roger Hickman has however dissented from this consensus view. He notes a change in string quartet writing towards the end of the 1760s, featuring characteristics which are today thought of as essential to the genre \u2013 scoring for two violins, viola and cello, solo passages, and absence of actual or potential basso continuo accompaniment. Noting that at this time other composers than Haydn were writing works conforming to these 'modern' criteria, and that Haydn's earlier quartets did not meet them, he suggests that \"one casualty [of such a perspective] is the notion that Haydn \"invented\" the string quartet... Although he may still be considered the 'father' of the 'Classical' string quartet, he is not the creator of the sting quartet genre itself... This old and otiose myth not only misrepresents the achievements of other excellent composers, but also distorts the character and qualities of Haydn's opp. 1, 2 and 9\". \nThe musicologist Cliff Eisen contextualizes the Op. 20 quartets as follows: \"Haydn's quartets of the late 1760s and early 1770s [opp. 9, 17, and 20] are high points in the early history of the quartet. Characterized by a wide range of textures, frequent asymmetries and theatrical gestures...these quartets established the genre's four-movement form, its larger dimensions, and ...its greater aesthetic pretensions and expressive range.\"\nThat Haydn's string quartets were already \"classics\" that defined the genre by 1801 can be judged by Ignaz Pleyel's publication in Paris of a \"complete\" series that year, and the quartet's evolution as vehicle for public performance can be judged by Pleyel's ten-volume set of miniature scores intended for hearers rather than players \u2013 early examples of this genre of music publishing. Since Haydn's day, the string quartet has been prestigious and considered one of the true tests of a composer's art. This may be partly because the palette of sound is more restricted than with orchestral music, forcing the music to stand more on its own rather than relying on tonal color; or from the inherently contrapuntal tendency in music written for four equal instruments.\nAfter Haydn.\nQuartet composition flourished in the Classical era. Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert each composed a number of quartets: \"Beethoven in particular is credited with developing the genre in an experimental and dynamic fashion, especially in his later series of quartets written in the 1820s up until his death. Their forms and ideas inspired and continue to inspire musicians and composers, such as Wagner and Bart\u00f3k.\" Schubert's last musical wish was to hear Beethoven's Quartet in C\u266f minor, Op. 131, which he heard on 14 November 1828, just five days before his death. Upon listening to an earlier performance of this quartet, Schubert had remarked, \"After this, what is left for us to write?\" Wagner, when reflecting on Op. 131's first movement, said that it \"reveals the most melancholy sentiment expressed in music\". Of the late quartets, Beethoven cited his own favorite as Op. 131, which he saw as his most perfect single work.\nMendelssohn's six string quartets span the full range of his career, from 1828 to 1847; Schumann's three string quartets were all written in 1842 and dedicated to Mendelssohn, whose quartets Schumann had been studying in preparation, along with those of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Several Romantic-era composers wrote only one quartet, while Dvo\u0159\u00e1k wrote 14.\nIn the 20th century.\nIn the modern era, the string quartet played a key role in the development of Schoenberg (who added a soprano in his String Quartet No. 2), Bart\u00f3k, and Shostakovich especially. After the Second World War, some composers, such as Messiaen questioned the relevance of the string quartet and avoided writing them. However, from the 1960s onwards, many composers have shown a renewed interest in the genre. \nDuring his tenure as Master of the Queen's Music, Peter Maxwell Davies produced a set of ten entitled the Naxos Quartets (to a commission from Naxos Records) from 2001 to 2007. Margaret Jones Wiles composed over 50 string quartets. David Matthews has written eleven, and Robin Holloway both five quartets and six \"quartettini\". Over nearly five decades, Elliott Carter wrote a total of five string quartets, winning Pulitzer Prizes for two of them, No. 2 and No. 3. Three important string quartets were written by Helmut Lachenmann. The late 20th century also saw the string quartet expand in various ways: Morton Feldman's vast Second String Quartet is one of the longest ever written, and Karlheinz Stockhausen's Helikopter-Streichquartett is to be performed by the four musicians in four helicopters.\nString quartets of the classical period.\nQuartets written during the classical period usually had four movements, with a structure similar to that of a symphony:\nThe positions of the slow movement and third movement are flexible. For example, in Mozart's six quartets dedicated to Haydn, three have a minuet followed by a slow movement and three have the slow movement before the minuet.\nSubstantial modifications to the typical structure were already present by the time of Beethoven's late quartets, and despite some notable examples to the contrary, composers writing in the twentieth century increasingly abandoned this structure. Bart\u00f3k's fourth and fifth string quartets, written in the 1930s, are five-movement works, symmetrical around a central movement. Shostakovich's final quartet, written in the 1970s, comprises six slow movements.\nVariations of string quartet.\nMany other chamber groups can be seen as modifications of the string quartet:\nFurther expansions have also produced works such as the String octet by Mendelssohn, consisting of the equivalent of two string quartets. Notably, Schoenberg included a soprano in the last two movements of his second string quartet, composed in 1908. Adding a voice has since been done by Milhaud, Ginastera, Ferneyhough, Davies, \u0130lhan Mimaro\u011flu and many others. Another variation on the traditional string quartet is the electric string quartet with players performing on electric instruments.\nNotable string quartets.\nNotable works for string quartet include:\nString quartets (ensembles).\nWhereas individual string players often group together to make ad hoc string quartets, others continue to play together for many years in ensembles which may be named after the first violinist (e.g. the Tak\u00e1cs Quartet), a composer (e.g. the Borodin Quartet) or a location (e.g. the Budapest Quartet). Established quartets may undergo changes in membership whilst retaining their original name.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

After insurgents led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (; FSLN) were closing in on Managua in July 1979, Somoza fled Nicaragua. Power was ceded to the Junta of National Reconstruction. He was assassinated in 1980 while in exile in Paraguay.\nEarly life and education.\nSomoza Debayle, nicknamed \"Tachito\" (Spanish: \"Little Tacho\") by his father, was born in 1925 as the third child of Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda and Salvadora Debayle. At the age of seven, he was enrolled at the Instituto Pedag\u00f3gico La Salle, run by the Christian Brothers. One of his classmates was Pedro Joaqu\u00edn Chamorro Cardenal, who later became a journalist and publisher of \"La Prensa\" newspaper and one of the most prominent opponents of the Somoza dynasty.\nFrom the age of ten, Tachito was educated in the United States. During this period, their father became president of Nicaragua, and served from 1937 to 1947, and again from 1950 into 1956. He and older brother Luis Somoza Debayle both attended St. Leo College Prep (Florida) and La Salle Military Academy on Long Island.\nSomoza attended La Salle with Lt. Andrew Edward Tuck III, uncle of American television host Stephen Colbert, and would stay at the family home in Larchmont during the holidays instead of returning to Nicaragua. This led to Somoza going on several dates with Andrew Edward's sister and Colbert's mother, Lorna.\nSomoza Debayle passed the examination for West Point, entered the United States Military Academy on July 3, 1943, and graduated on June 6, 1946.\nAfter his return to Nicaragua, Somoza Debayle was appointed chief of staff of the National Guard (Nicaragua's national army), by his father. The president had also appointed numerous family members and close personal friends to other important posts in his government. As commander of the Guard, the young Somoza was head of the nation's armed forces, effectively the second-most powerful man in Nicaragua.\nTwo years after his return from West Point, Somoza Debayle had an affair and fathered a daughter, Patricia. She was later sent to a series of schools abroad.\nOn 10 December 1950, Somoza married Hope Portocarrero, an American citizen and his first cousin. Their wedding was held at the Cathedral in Managua and officiated by Archbishop Jose Antonio Lezcano. Over 4,000 guests attended the ceremony. The reception was given by Somoza's father, President Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, in the luxurious and modern Palacio de Comunicaciones.\nThe couple had five children:\nSomoza and Hope attended the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.\nFollowing their father's assassination on 21 September 1956, Somoza's elder brother, Luis, took over the presidency. Anastasio also had a large hand in the government during this time; he helped ensure that the presidency was held by politicians loyal to his family from 1963 to 1967.\nPresidency.\nAnastasio was elected president in his own right on 5 February 1967 and took office on 1 May, a few weeks after his brother's death. While Luis had ruled more gently than his father, Anastasio shared his father's cold intolerance of dissent. His rule soon resembled his father's in all significant respects, with harsh repression of dissent.\nOn education Somoza in his memoirs states \"My dream was to provide a University equal to any in the world so that those young men and women with special qualifications could achieve educational equivalency with any student in any part of the world\".\nIn 1968, Prince Rainier III bestowed Somoza with the Order of St. Charles, Monaco's highest honor.\nHe was due to leave office in May 1972; at the time, Nicaraguan presidents were barred from immediate re-election. However, prior to that, Somoza worked out an agreement that allowed him to stand for re-election in 1974. He would be replaced as president by a three-man junta consisting of two members of his Nationalist Liberal Party and one member from the opposition Conservative while he retained control of the National Guard. Somoza and his triumvirate drew up a new constitution that was ratified by the triumvirate and the cabinet on April 3, 1971. He stepped down as president on May 1, 1972. However, as head of the National Guard, he remained the \"de facto\" ruler of the country.\nAnastasio Somoza and his son were both part owners of Plasmaferesis. The company collected blood plasma from up to 1,000 of Nicaragua's poorest persons every day for sale in the United States and Europe. According to \"El Diario Nuevo\" and \"La Prensa\", \"Every morning the homeless, drunks, and poor people went to sell half a liter of blood for 35 (Nicaraguan) cordobas.\nOn 23 December 1972, an earthquake struck the nation's capital, Managua, killing about 5,000 people and virtually destroying the city. The government declared martial law, and Somoza took over \"de jure\" as well as \"de facto\" control of the country as head of the National Emergency Committee. He reportedly embezzled a large amount of money from funds sent to Nicaragua from around the world to help rebuild Managua. These reports were debunked by the U.S. House subcommittee on International Development March 9, 1978, stating \"Since the 1972 earthquake, 28 major audits, two separate congressional staff surveys, and a General Accounting Office report on reconstruction activities have been completed. We are pleased to note that no diversion or misuse of official U.S. assistance has been revealed by these reports.\"\nSome parts of Managua have yet to be rebuilt or restored, including the National Cathedral.\nSomoza also allegedly exported freshly imported emergency blood plasma abroad at the time of the earthquake, when most medical supplies in Nicaragua were desperately in short supply.\nSomoza was re-elected president in the 1974 election. By this time, the Catholic Church had begun to speak out against his government (one of his fiercest critics was Ernesto Cardenal, a leftist Nicaraguan priest who preached liberation theology and was later appointed as the Sandinista government's Minister of Culture). By the late 1970s, human rights groups were condemning the record of the Somoza government. Support for the Sandinistas was growing inside and outside the country.\nIn July 1977, Somoza had a heart attack, and went to the US to recuperate.\nFall.\nIn 1975 Somoza Debayle launched a campaign to crush the Sandinistas; individuals suspected of supporting the Front were targeted. The Front, named after Augusto C\u00e9sar Sandino (a Nicaraguan rebel leader in the 1920s), began its guerrilla war against the Somozas in 1963. It received funds from the Soviet Union and Cuba under Fidel Castro. Support for the Sandinistas ballooned after the earthquake, especially when U.S. President Jimmy Carter withdrew American support for the regime for human rights reasons, including the televised murder of American journalist Bill Stewart by government soldiers.\nAt this point, the opposition to the Somozas included not only Sandinistas, but other prominent figures such as publisher Pedro Chamorro (assassinated on January 10, 1978).\nBecause of Somoza's status, most of his family members were forced to flee into Honduras, Guatemala, and the United States. It is uncertain where the surviving Somozas live; they changed their names to protect their own lives.\nOn July 17, 1979, Somoza resigned from the presidency and fled to Miami in a converted Curtiss C-46. He took with him the caskets of his father and brother and, it is claimed, much of Nicaragua's national treasure. \nThe country was left with $1.6 billion in foreign debt, the highest in Central America. After Somoza had fled, the Sandinistas found less than $2 million in the national treasury.\nDenied asylum in the U.S. by President Carter, Somoza later took refuge in Paraguay, then under the rule of Alfredo Stroessner. He bought a ranch and a gated house at Avenida Espa\u00f1a no. 433 in Asunci\u00f3n, the capital. The president of the Nicaraguan Chamber of Deputies, Francisco Urcuyo, took over as acting president, but lasted only a day before peacefully handing Managua to the Sandinistas.\nDeath.\nLittle more than a year later, Somoza was shot dead in Asunci\u00f3n on September 17, 1980. He was 54 years old. He was ambushed by a seven-strong Sandinista commando team (four men and three women). The action was known as \"Operation Reptile\".\nThe Sandinista team were armed with two Soviet-made machine guns, two AK-47 assault rifles, two automatic pistols, and an RPG-7 rocket launcher, with four anti-tank grenades and two rockets. The leader was Argentinian Marxist revolutionary Enrique Gorriar\u00e1n Merlo (code named \"Ramon\"), an ex-Ej\u00e9rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo member. One of the team members said: \"We cannot tolerate the existence of millionaire playboys while thousands of Latin Americans are dying of hunger. We are perfectly willing to give up our lives for this cause.\"\nThe Sandinista team had researched and planned their assault over a time period of more than six months. The team studied Somoza's movements via a team member who was staked out at a newspaper kiosk near the estate. The commando team also utilized disinformation tactics to gain access into important residencies under the guise of a famous name, that being Julio Iglesias. They waited in ambush for Somoza in Avenida Espa\u00f1a. Somoza was often driven about the city in a Mercedes-Benz S-Class sedan, which was believed to be unarmored. Team member Oswaldo, disguised as a paper boy, watched Somoza exit the estate and signaled when he was leaving at 10:10 am.\nOnce in position, Hugo Irurz\u00fan (\"Capit\u00e1n Santiago\") readied the RPG-7. He tried to fire an anti-tank rocket at the car, but the RPG-7 misfired. Ramon shot the chauffeur while Irurz\u00fan quickly reloaded the RPG with a new rocket. The second rocket directly hit the sedan. Accounts said that the car's engine kept running after the rocket explosion. Previously, the commando team had considered the possibility that Somoza's vehicle might be equipped with armor panels in front. Worried that it could deflect the rocket projectile, they chose to make a lateral attack on the vehicle. Somoza was killed instantly and burned, along with his new driver, C\u00e9sar Gallardo, and Somoza's financial advisor, Colombian citizen Jou Baittiner. Later media reports in Paraguay said that Somoza's body was so unrecognizable that forensics had to identify him through his feet.\nOf the seven assassins, six escaped. Irurz\u00fan was killed in a shootout with Paraguayan police the day after the assassination.\nSomoza was buried in Miami, at Woodlawn Park Cemetery and Mausoleum, although his father Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda and brother Luis Somoza Debayle, both prior presidents of Nicaragua, were buried in Nicaragua. A few months before Somoza's murder, his memoirs, \"Nicaragua Betrayed\", were published. He blamed the Carter administration for his downfall. His son, Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, went into exile in Guatemala.\nBrian Latell, a former US National Intelligence Officer for Latin America and Cuba, argues in his book, \"After Fidel\", that the plan to assassinate Somoza was devised in Havana, with direct input from Fidel Castro. According to him, the Sandinistas had won power in July 1979 with the assistance of massive, covert Cuban military aid. Fidel and his brother Ra\u00fal Castro purportedly developed a complex, multinational covert action to provide the Sandinistas with huge quantities of modern armaments. Latell claims Cuban intelligence and paramilitary advisors poured into Nicaragua along with the equipment. He says the evidence indicated that Somoza's assassination was similar to other such operations in which Cuban intelligence had been involved. He says that Somoza was a long-time nemesis of Castro after having provided critical support to the U.S. in preparing for the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. Jorge Masetti, a former Argentine guerrilla working with Cuban intelligence services, describes the Somoza assassination and also asserts that Cuba had a direct role in planning it in his memoir, \"In the Pirate's Den\" (2002).\nSomoza's funeral attracted numerous wealthy Nicaraguan and Cuban exiles in South Florida, who protested the left-wing governments of Nicaragua, led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, and Cuba, led by the Communist Party of Cuba. But some commentators noted that the exiles in Miami were also relieved at Somoza's death. The newly founded Contra army, which consisted of many ex-members of Somoza's National Guard, would have had to give the impression of having no relation to the old Somoza regime, for purposes of public relations and world opinion.\nIn 1979, the Brazilian newspaper \"Gazeta Mercantil\" estimated that the Somoza family's fortune amounted to between $2 billion and $4 billion with its head, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, owning $1 billion. At the time he fled the country, he reportedly personally controlled 22 percent of the agricultural land of Nicaragua.\nIn popular culture.\nSomoza was the subject of the 1983 film \"Last Plane Out\", in which he was portrayed by actor Lloyd Battista. The film chronicles journalist Jack Cox's journey to Nicaragua, when Somoza was battling insurgents. The same year, he was depicted in \"Under Fire\", set during the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution, this time portrayed by actor Ren\u00e9 Enriquez. In Warren Beatty's \"Rules Don't Apply\", Somoza is portrayed by Julio Oscar Mechoso.\nIn Graham Greene's novel \"The Captain and the Enemy\", the titular character's final act is a failed attempt at assassinating Somoza by crashing a plane into his bunker, though Somoza himself never appears in the book.\nAmerican comedian Stephen Colbert's mother briefly dated him. Colbert still has his pants in his house, as mentioned in the podcast \"Strike Force Five\".\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nBibliography.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;"}

It is used for slowing or stopping a moving vehicle, wheel, axle, or to prevent its motion, most often accomplished by means of friction.\nBackground.\nMost brakes commonly use friction between two surfaces pressed together to convert the kinetic energy of the moving object into heat, though other methods of energy conversion may be employed. For example, regenerative braking converts a significant portion of the otherwise wasted kinetic energy of a moving vehicle into electrical energy, which can be stored in batteries for later use. Other methods convert kinetic energy into potential energy in such stored forms as pressurized air or pressurized oil. Eddy current brakes use magnetic fields to convert kinetic energy into electric current in the brake disc, fin, or rail, which is converted into heat. Still other braking methods transform the kinetic energy into different forms, for example, by transferring the energy to a rotating flywheel.\nBrakes are generally applied to rotating axles or wheels, but may also take other forms, such as the surface of a moving fluid (flaps deployed into water or air). Some vehicles utilize a combination of braking mechanisms, such as drag racing cars equipped with both wheel brakes and a parachute, or airplanes that employ both wheel brakes and flaps raised into the air during landing.\nSince kinetic energy increases quadratically with velocity (formula_1), an object moving at 10\u00a0m/s has 100 times as much energy as one of the same mass moving at 1\u00a0m/s. Consequently, the theoretical braking distance, when braking at the traction limit, is up to 100 times as long. In practice, fast vehicles typically experience significant air drag, and the energy lost to air drag increases rapidly with speed.\nAlmost all wheeled vehicles have a brake of some sort. Even baggage carts and shopping carts may have them for use on a moving ramp. Most fixed-wing aircraft are fitted with wheel brakes on the undercarriage. Some aircraft also feature air brakes designed to reduce their speed in flight. Notable examples include gliders and some World War II-era aircraft, primarily some fighter aircraft and many dive bombers of the era. These allow the aircraft to maintain a safe speed in a steep descent. The Saab B 17 dive bomber and Vought F4U Corsair fighter used the deployed undercarriage as an air brake.\nFriction brakes on automobiles store braking heat in the drum brake or disc brake while braking, then conduct it to the air gradually. When traveling downhill, some vehicles can use their engines to brake.\nWhen the brake pedal of a modern vehicle with hydraulic brakes is pushed against the master cylinder, ultimately a piston pushes the brake pad against the brake disc, which slows the wheel down. In a brake drum design, a similar action is employed, involving a cylinder that pushes the brake shoes against the drum, thereby slowing the rotation.\nTypes.\nBrakes may be broadly described as using friction, pumping, or electromagnetics. One brake may use several principles: for example, a pump may pass fluid through an orifice to create friction:\nFrictional.\nFrictional brakes are most common and can be divided broadly into \"shoe\" or \"pad\" brakes, using an explicit wear surface, and hydrodynamic brakes, such as parachutes, which use friction in a working fluid and do not explicitly wear. Typically the term \"friction brake\" is used to mean pad/shoe brakes and excludes hydrodynamic brakes, even though hydrodynamic brakes use friction. Friction (pad/shoe) brakes are often rotating devices with a stationary pad and a rotating wear surface. Common configurations include shoes that contract to rub on the outside of a rotating drum, such as a band brake; a rotating drum with shoes that expand to rub the inside of a drum, commonly called a \"drum brake\", although other drum configurations are possible; and pads that pinch a rotating disc, commonly called a \"disc brake\". Other brake configurations are used, but less often. For example, PCC trolley brakes include a flat shoe which is clamped to the rail with an electromagnet; the Murphy brake pinches a rotating drum, and the Ausco Lambert disc brake uses a hollow disc (two parallel discs with a structural bridge) with shoes that sit between the disc surfaces and expand laterally.\nA drum brake is a vehicle brake in which the friction is caused by a set of brake shoes that press against the inner surface of a rotating drum. The drum is connected to the rotating roadwheel hub.\nDrum brakes generally can be found on older car and truck models. However, because of their low production cost, drum brake setups are also installed on the rear of some low-cost newer vehicles. Compared to modern disc brakes, drum brakes wear out faster due to their tendency to overheat.\nThe disc brake is a device for slowing or stopping the rotation of a road wheel. A brake disc (or rotor in U.S. English), usually made of cast iron or ceramic, is connected to the wheel or the axle. To stop the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads (mounted in a device called a brake caliper) is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.\nPumping.\nPumping brakes are often used where a pump is already part of the machinery. For example, an internal-combustion piston motor can have the fuel supply stopped, and then internal pumping losses of the engine create some braking. Some engines use a valve override called a Jake brake to greatly increase pumping losses. Pumping brakes can dump energy as heat, or can be regenerative brakes that recharge a pressure reservoir called a hydraulic accumulator.\nElectromagnetic.\nElectromagnetic brakes are likewise often used where an electric motor is already part of the machinery. For example, many hybrid gasoline/electric vehicles use the electric motor as a generator to charge electric batteries and also as a regenerative brake. Some diesel/electric railroad locomotives use the electric motors to generate electricity which is then sent to a resistor bank and dumped as heat. Some vehicles, such as some transit buses, do not already have an electric motor but use a secondary \"retarder\" brake that is effectively a generator with an internal short circuit. Related types of such a brake are eddy current brakes, and electro-mechanical brakes (which actually are magnetically driven friction brakes, but nowadays are often just called \"electromagnetic brakes\" as well).\nElectromagnetic brakes slow an object through electromagnetic induction, which creates resistance and in turn either heat or electricity. Friction brakes apply pressure on two separate objects to slow the vehicle in a controlled manner.\nCharacteristics.\nBrakes are often described according to several characteristics including:\nFoundation components.\nFoundation components are the brake-assembly components at the wheels of a vehicle, named for forming the basis of the rest of the brake system. These mechanical parts contained around the wheels are controlled by the air brake system.\nThe three types of foundation brake systems are \u201cS\u201d cam brakes, disc brakes and wedge brakes.\nBrake boost.\nMost modern passenger vehicles, and light vans, use a vacuum assisted brake system that greatly increases the force applied to the vehicle's brakes by its operator. This additional force is supplied by the manifold vacuum generated by air flow being obstructed by the throttle on a running engine. This force is greatly reduced when the engine is running at fully open throttle, as the difference between ambient air pressure and manifold (absolute) air pressure is reduced, and therefore available vacuum is diminished. However, brakes are rarely applied at full throttle; the driver takes the right foot off the gas pedal and moves it to the brake pedal - unless left-foot braking is used.\nBecause of low vacuum at high RPM, reports of unintended acceleration are often accompanied by complaints of failed or weakened brakes, as the high-revving engine, having an open throttle, is unable to provide enough vacuum to power the brake booster. This problem is exacerbated in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions as the vehicle will automatically downshift upon application of the brakes, thereby increasing the torque delivered to the driven-wheels in contact with the road surface.\nHeavier road vehicles, as well as trains, usually boost brake power with compressed air, supplied by one or more compressors.\nNoise.\nAlthough ideally a brake would convert all the kinetic energy into heat, in practice a significant amount may be converted into acoustic energy instead, contributing to noise pollution.\nFor road vehicles, the noise produced varies significantly with tire construction, road surface, and the magnitude of the deceleration. Noise can be caused by different things. These are signs that there may be issues with brakes wearing out over time.\nFires.\nRailway brake malfunctions can produce sparks and cause forest fires. In some very extreme cases, disc brakes can become red hot and set on fire. This happened in the Tuscan GP, when the Mercedes car, the W11 had its front carbon disc brakes almost bursting into flames, due to low ventilation and high usage. These fires can also occur on some Mercedes Sprinter vans, when the load adjusting sensor seizes up and the rear brakes have to compensate for the fronts.\nInefficiency.\nA significant amount of energy is always lost while braking, even with regenerative braking which is not perfectly efficient. Therefore, a good metric of efficient energy use while driving is to note how much one is braking. If the majority of deceleration is from unavoidable friction instead of braking, one is squeezing out most of the service from the vehicle. Minimizing brake use is one of the fuel economy-maximizing behaviors.\nWhile energy is always lost during a brake event, a secondary factor that influences efficiency is \"off-brake drag\", or drag that occurs when the brake is not intentionally actuated. After a braking event, hydraulic pressure drops in the system, allowing the brake caliper pistons to retract. However, this retraction must accommodate all compliance in the system (under pressure) as well as thermal distortion of components like the brake disc or the brake system will drag until the contact with the disc, for example, knocks the pads and pistons back from the rubbing surface. During this time, there can be significant brake drag. This brake drag can lead to significant parasitic power loss, thus impacting fuel economy and overall vehicle performance.\nHistory.\nEarly brake system.\nIn the 1890s, Wooden block brakes became obsolete when Michelin brothers introduced rubber tires.\nDuring the 1960s, some car manufacturers replaced drum brakes with disc brakes.\nElectronic brake system.\nIn 1966, an ABS was fitted in the Jensen FF grand tourer. There was no electronic control: wheel lock-up was detected mechanically by a Dunlop Maxaret unit fitted to the centre differential of the Ferguson four wheel drive system and brake pressure was modulated by a solenoid actuated valve.\nIn 1978, Bosch and Mercedes updated their 1936 anti-lock brake system for the Mercedes S-Class. That ABS is a fully electronic, four-wheel and multi-channel system that later became standard.\nIn 2005, ESC \u2014 which automatically applies the brakes to avoid a loss of steering control \u2014 become compulsory for carriers of dangerous goods without data recorders in the Canadian province of Quebec.\nSince 2017, numerous United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) countries use \"Brake Assist System\" (BAS) a function of the braking system that deduces an emergency braking event from a characteristic of the driver's brake demand and under such conditions assist the driver to improve braking.\nIn July 2013 UNECE vehicle regulation 131 was enacted. This regulation defines Advanced Emergency Braking Systems (AEBS) for heavy vehicles to automatically detect a potential forward collision and activate the vehicle braking system.\nOn 23 January 2020 UNECE vehicle regulation 152 was enacted, defining Advanced Emergency Braking Systems for light vehicles.\nFrom May 2022, in the European Union, by law, new vehicles will have advanced emergency-braking system.\nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

At a very basic level, hydraulics is the liquid counterpart of pneumatics, which concerns gases. Fluid mechanics provides the theoretical foundation for hydraulics, which focuses on applied engineering using the properties of fluids. In its fluid power applications, hydraulics is used for the generation, control, and transmission of power by the use of pressurized liquids. Hydraulic topics range through some parts of science and most of engineering modules, and they cover concepts such as pipe flow, dam design, fluidics, and fluid control circuitry. The principles of hydraulics are naturally in use in the human body within the vascular system and erectile tissue.\n\"Free surface hydraulics\" is the branch of hydraulics dealing with free surface flow, such as occurring in rivers, canals, lakes, estuaries, and seas. Its sub-field open-channel flow studies the flow in open channels.\nEarly history.\nEarly uses of water power date back to Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt, where irrigation has been used since the 6th millennium BC and water clocks have been used since the early 2nd millennium BC. Other early examples of water power include the Qanat system in ancient Persia, the Turpan water system in ancient Central Asia, and the Piedras Bolas aqueduct in ancient Mexico.\nMayan Empire.\nThe Maya at Palenque (in modern-day Chiapas, Mexico) engineered the first known pressurized water system in the Americas. By constructing a subterranean aqueduct (the Piedras Bolas aqueduct) that narrowed significantly at the downstream end, they utilized hydraulic principles to create water pressure capable of shooting water upwards to a height of 6 meters (20 ft). This system was likely used for fountains or sanitary purposes, operating without the need for mechanical pumps.\nPersian Empire and Urartu.\nIn the Persian Empire or previous entities in Persia, the Persians constructed an intricate system of water mills, canals and dams known as the Shushtar Historical Hydraulic System. The project, commenced by Achaemenid king Darius the Great and finished by a group of Roman engineers captured by Sassanian king Shapur I, has been referred to by UNESCO as \"a masterpiece of creative genius\". They were also the inventors of the Qanat, an underground aqueduct, around the 9th century BC. Several of Iran's large, ancient gardens were irrigated thanks to Qanats.\nThe Qanat spread to neighboring areas, including the Armenian highlands. There, starting in the early 8th century BC, the Kingdom of Urartu undertook significant hydraulic works, such as the Menua canal.\nThe earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills dates back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC, specifically in the Persian Empire before 350\u00a0BCE, in the regions of Iraq, Iran, and Egypt.\nChina.\nIn ancient China there was Sunshu Ao (6th century BC), Ximen Bao (5th century BC), Du Shi (circa 31 AD), Zhang Heng (78 \u2013 139 AD), and Ma Jun (200 \u2013 265 AD), while medieval China had Su Song (1020 \u2013 1101 AD) and Shen Kuo (1031\u20131095). Du Shi employed a waterwheel to power the bellows of a blast furnace producing cast iron. Zhang Heng was the first to employ hydraulics to provide motive power in rotating an armillary sphere for astronomical observation.\nSri Lanka.\nIn ancient Sri Lanka, hydraulics were widely used in the ancient kingdoms of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa. The discovery of the principle of the valve tower, or valve pit, (Bisokotuwa in Sinhalese) for regulating the escape of water is credited to ingenuity more than 2,000 years ago. By the first century AD, several large-scale irrigation works had been completed. Macro- and micro-hydraulics to provide for domestic horticultural and agricultural needs, surface drainage and erosion control, ornamental and recreational water courses and retaining structures and also cooling systems were in place in Sigiriya, Sri Lanka. The coral on the massive rock at the site includes cisterns for collecting water. Large ancient reservoirs of Sri Lanka are Kalawewa (King Dhatusena), Parakrama Samudra (King Parakrama Bahu), Tisa Wewa (King Dutugamunu), and Minneriya (King Mahasen)\nGreco-Roman world.\nIn Ancient Greece, the Greeks constructed sophisticated water and hydraulic power systems. An example is a construction by Eupalinos, under a public contract, of a watering channel for Samos, the Tunnel of Eupalinos. An early example of the usage of a hydraulic wheel, likely the earliest in Europe, is the Perachora wheel (3rd century BC).\nIn Greco-Roman Egypt, the construction of the first hydraulic machine automata by Ctesibius (flourished c. 270 BC) and Hero of Alexandria (c. 10 \u2013 80 AD) is notable. Hero describes several working machines using hydraulic power, such as the force pump, which is known from many Roman sites as having been used for raising water and in fire engines.\nIn the Roman Empire, different hydraulic applications were developed, including public water supplies, innumerable aqueducts, power using watermills and hydraulic mining. They were among the first to make use of the siphon to carry water across valleys, and used hushing on a large scale to prospect for and then extract metal ores. They used lead widely in plumbing systems for domestic and public supply, such as feeding thermae.\nHydraulic mining was used in the gold-fields of northern Spain, which was conquered by Augustus in 25 BC. The alluvial gold-mine of Las Medulas was one of the largest of their mines. At least seven long aqueducts worked it, and the water streams were used to erode the soft deposits, and then wash the tailings for the valuable gold content.\nArabic-Islamic world.\nIn the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age and Arab Agricultural Revolution (8th\u201313th centuries), engineers made wide use of hydropower as well as early uses of tidal power, and large hydraulic factory complexes. A variety of water-powered industrial mills were used in the Islamic world, including fulling mills, gristmills, paper mills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, and tide mills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from Al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also used water turbines, employed gears in watermills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.\nAl-Jazari (1136\u20131206) described designs for 50 devices, many of them water-powered, in his book, \"The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices\", including water clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools. These include an endless belt with jugs attached and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.\nThe earliest programmable machines were water-powered devices developed in the Muslim world. A music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was the earliest type of programmable machine. The first music sequencer was an automated water-powered flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their \"Book of Ingenious Devices\", in the 9th century. In 1206, Al-Jazari invented water-powered programmable automata/robots. He described four automaton musicians, including drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where they could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns.\nModern history.\nDuring the mid 16th century, Italian engineer Giuseppe Ceredi advanced the design of the Archimedean screw pump, applying mathematical principles to improve its efficiency for irrigation and drainage and secured a patent for his developments. Ceredi's innovations, documented in \"Tre discorsi sopra il modo d'alzar acque da' luoghi bassi\" (1567), led to the widespread adoption of the technology throughout Southern Europe. In 1619 Benedetto Castelli, a student of Galileo Galilei, published the book \"Della Misura dell'Acque Correnti\" or \"On the Measurement of Running Waters,\" one of the foundations of modern hydrodynamics. He served as a chief consultant to the Pope on hydraulic projects, i.e., management of rivers in the Papal States, beginning in 1626. The science and engineering of water in Italy from 1500-1800 in books and manuscripts is presented in an illustrated catalog published in 2022.\nBlaise Pascal (1623\u20131662) studied fluid hydrodynamics and hydrostatics, centered on the principles of hydraulic fluids. His discovery on the theory behind hydraulics led to his invention of the hydraulic press, which multiplied a smaller force acting on a smaller area into the application of a larger force totaled over a larger area, transmitted through the same pressure (or exact change of pressure) at both locations. Pascal's law or principle states that for an incompressible fluid at rest, the difference in pressure is proportional to the difference in height, and this difference remains the same whether or not the overall pressure of the fluid is changed by applying an external force. This implies that by increasing the pressure at any point in a confined fluid, there is an equal increase at every other end in the container, i.e., any change in pressure applied at any point of the liquid is transmitted undiminished throughout the fluids.\nA French physician, Poiseuille (1797\u20131869) researched the flow of blood through the body and discovered an important law governing the rate of flow with the diameter of the tube in which flow occurred.\nSeveral cities developed citywide hydraulic power networks in the 19th century, to operate machinery such as lifts, cranes, capstans and the like. Joseph Bramah (1748\u20131814) was an early innovator and William Armstrong (1810\u20131900) perfected the apparatus for power delivery on an industrial scale. In London, the London Hydraulic Power Company was a major supplier its pipes serving large parts of the West End of London, City and the Docks, but there were schemes restricted to single enterprises such as docks and railway goods yards.\nHydraulic models.\nAfter students understand the basic principles of hydraulics, some teachers use a hydraulic analogy to help students learn other things.\nFor example:\nThe conservation of mass requirement combined with fluid compressibility yields a fundamental relationship between pressure, fluid flow, and volumetric expansion, as shown below:\n formula_1\nAssuming an incompressible fluid or a \"very large\" ratio of compressibility to contained fluid volume, a finite rate of pressure rise requires that any net flow into the collected fluid volume create a volumetric change.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

He was the son of the astronomer Mikhail Lyapunov and the brother of the pianist and composer Sergei Lyapunov.\nLyapunov is known for his development of the stability theory of a dynamical system, as well as for his many contributions to mathematical physics and probability theory.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLyapunov was born in Yaroslavl, Russian Empire. His father Mikhail Vasilyevich Lyapunov (1820\u20131868) was an astronomer employed by the Demidov Lyceum. His brother, Sergei Lyapunov, was a gifted composer and pianist. In 1863, M. V. Lyapunov retired from his scientific career and relocated his family to his wife's estate at Bolobonov, in the Simbirsk province (now Ulyanovsk Oblast). After the death of his father in 1868, Aleksandr Lyapunov was educated by his uncle R. M. Sechenov, brother of the physiologist Ivan Mikhailovich Sechenov. At his uncle's family, Lyapunov studied with his distant cousin Natalia Rafailovna, who became his wife in 1886. In 1870, his mother moved with her sons to Nizhny Novgorod, where he started the third class of the gymnasium. He graduated from the gymnasium with distinction in 1876.\nEducation.\nIn 1876, Lyapunov entered the Physico-Mathematical department at the University of Saint Petersburg, but after one month he transferred to the Mathematics department of the university.\nAmong the Saint Petersburg mathematics professors were Chebyshev and his students Aleksandr Nikolaevich Korkin and Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev. Lyapunov wrote his first independent scientific works under the guidance of the professor of mechanics, D. K. Bobylev. In 1880 Lyapunov received a gold medal for a work on hydrostatics. This was the basis for his first published scientific works \"On the equilibrium of a heavy body in a heavy fluid contained in a vessel of a fixed form\" and \"On the potential of hydrostatic pressure\". Lyapunov also completed his university course in 1880, two years after Andrey Markov who had also graduated at Saint Petersburg University. Lyapunov maintained scientific contact with Markov throughout his life.\nTeaching and research.\nA major theme in Lyapunov's research was the stability of a rotating fluid mass with possible astronomical application. This subject was proposed to Lyapunov by Chebyshev as a topic for his masters thesis which he submitted in 1884 with the title \"On the stability of ellipsoidal forms of rotating fluids\". The main contribution was published in the celebrated monograph 'A.M. Lyapunov, The general problem of the stability of motion. 1892. Kharkov Mathematical Society, Kharkov, 251p. (in Russian)'. This led on to his 1892 doctoral thesis \"The general problem of the stability of motion\". The thesis was defended in Moscow University on 12 September 1892, with Nikolai Zhukovsky and V. B. Mlodzeevski as opponents. In 1908, the Kharkov edition was translated to French and republished by the University of Toulouse: 'Probleme General de la Stabilite du Mouvement, Par M.A. Liapounoff. Traduit du russe par M.Edouard Davaux'.\nIn 1885, Lyapunov became privatdozent and was proposed to accept the chair of mechanics at Kharkov University, where he went the same year. About the initial stay at Kharkov, Smirnov writes in his biography of Lyapunov:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;Here at first, the research activity of Lyapunov was cut short. It was necessary to work out courses and put together notes for students, which took up much time.\nHis student and collaborator, Vladimir Steklov, recalled his first lecture in the following way: \"A handsome young man, almost of the age of the other students, came before the audience, where there was also the old Dean, professor Levakovsky, who was respected by all students. After the Dean had left, the young man with a trembled voice started to lecture a course on the dynamics of material points, instead of a course on dynamical systems. This subject was already known to the students from the lectures of professor Delarue. But what Lyapunov taught us was new to me and I had never seen this material in any textbook. All antipathy to the course was immediately blown to dust. From that day students would show Lyapunov a special respect.\"\nLater years.\nLyapunov returned to Saint Petersburg in 1902, after being elected acting member of the Academy of Science as well as ordinary professor in the Faculty of Applied Mathematics of the university. The position had been left vacant by the death of his former teacher, Chebyshev. Not having any teaching obligations, this allowed Lyapunov to focus on his studies and in particular he was able to bring to a conclusion the work on the problem of Chebyshev with which he started his scientific career.\nIn 1908, he took part to the Fourth International Mathematical Congress in Rome. He also participated in the publication of Euler's selected works: he was an editor of the volumes 18 and 19.\nDeath.\nBy the end of June 1917, Lyapunov traveled with his wife to his brother's palace in Odessa. Lyapunov's wife was suffering from tuberculosis so they moved in accordance with her doctor's orders. She died on 31 October 1918. The same day, Lyapunov shot himself in the head, and three days later he died. By that time, he was going blind from cataracts.\nWork.\nLyapunov contributed to several fields, including differential equations, potential theory, dynamical systems and probability theory. His main preoccupations were the stability of equilibria and the motion of mechanical systems, especially rotating fluid masses, and the study of particles under the influence of gravity. His work in the field of mathematical physics regarded the boundary value problem of the equation of Laplace. In the theory of potential, his work from 1897 \"On some questions connected with Dirichlet's problem\" clarified several important aspects of the theory. His work in this field is in close connection with the work of Steklov. Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system. In the theory of probability, he generalized the works of Chebyshev and Markov, and proved the Central Limit Theorem under more general conditions than his predecessors. The method of characteristic functions he used for the proof later found widespread use in probability theory.\nLike many mathematicians, Lyapunov preferred to work alone and communicated mainly with few colleagues and close relatives. He usually worked late, four to five hours at night, sometimes the whole night. Once or twice a year he visited the theatre, or went to some concert. He had many students. He was an honorary member of many universities, an honorary member of the academy in Rome and a corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris.\nLyapunov's impact was significant, and the following mathematical concepts are named after him: \nSee also.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Div col/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFurther reading.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Refbegin/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Howell's use of \"Black Supremacy\" had both religious and political implications. Politically, as a direct counterpoint to white supremacy, and the failure of white governments to protect black people, he advocated the destruction of white governments. Howell had drawn upon as an influence the work of the earlier proto-Rastafari preacher Fitz Balintine Pettersburg, in particular the latter's book \"The Royal Parchment Scroll of Black Supremacy\".\nThe Associated Press described the teachings of the Nation of Islam (NOI) as having been black supremacist until 1975, when W. Deen Mohammed succeeded Elijah Muhammad (his father) as its leader. Elijah Muhammad's black-supremacist doctrine acted as a counter to the supremacist paradigm established and controlled by white supremacy. The SPLC described the group as having a \"theology of innate black superiority over whites \u2013 a belief system vehemently and consistently rejected by mainstream Muslims\".\nGroups associated with black supremacist views.\nSeveral fringe groups have been described as either holding or promoting black supremacist beliefs. A source described by historian David Mark Chalmers as being \"the most extensive source on right-wing extremism\" is the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), an American nonprofit organization that monitors hate groups and extremists in the United States. Authors of the SPLC's quarterly \"Intelligence Reports\" have described the following groups as holding black supremacist views:\nOpposition from Martin Luther King Jr..\nDuring speeches given at the Freedom Rally in Cobo Hall on June 23, 1963, at Oberlin College in June 1965, and at the Southern Methodist University on March 17, 1966, Martin Luther King Jr. said:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;A doctrine of black supremacy is as dangerous as a doctrine of white supremacy.

When referring to the term plainsong, it is those sacred pieces that are composed in Latin text. Plainsong was the exclusive form of the Western Christian church music until the ninth century, and the introduction of polyphony.\nThe monophonic chants of plainsong have a non-metric rhythm, which is generally considered freer than the metered rhythms of later Western music. They are also traditionally sung without musical accompaniment, though recent scholarship has unearthed a widespread custom of accompanied chant that transcended religious and geographical borders.\nThere are three types of chant melodies that plainsongs fall into: syllabic, neumatic, and melismatic. The free flowing melismatic melody form of plainsong is still heard in Middle Eastern music being performed today.\nAlthough the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches did not split until long after the origin of plainsong, Byzantine chants are generally not classified as plainsong.\nHistory.\nPlainsong developed during the earliest centuries of Christianity, influenced possibly by the music of the Jewish synagogue and certainly by the Greek modal system. It has its own system of notation.\nAs the number of chants in the church's repertoire increased, officials needed a better way to standardize the music. A unique form of musical notation was developed to help standardize the music and provide a reference for the performers and audience alike. The musical notations that were used were called neumes, and they are employed on a four-line staff, unlike the five-line staff we are accustomed to today. The earliest neumes were marks placed above the chant's words to help the performer remember the piece's melody. They showed the general shape of the melody, but did not specify the pitches or intervals that needed to be sung, so the melody had to be learned by ear. It was not until the eleventh century that a notation system was perfected that placed the neumes on a four-line staff. This allowed the music to be written down accurately. In the example from the plainsong mass \"Orbis Factor\", the notes for each syllable of the text are grouped together. Their position on the lines shows their pitch relative to one another, and the dots after some notes indicate a lengthening of the note. The vertical stroke after the word \"Kyrie\" indicates where the singer may take a breath. \nMost of the early plainsong manuscripts have been destroyed due to war, purposeful destruction and natural causes such as water, fire, and poor environmental conditions. The Toledo Cathedral in Spain has one of the world's largest collections of indigenous plainsong manuscripts devoted to Western Christianity. Their collection consists of 170 volumes of plainsong chants for the procession, Mass, and Office.\nThere are three methods of singing psalms or other chants, responsorial, antiphonal, and solo. In responsorial singing, the soloist (or choir) sings a series of verses, each one followed by a response from the choir (or congregation). In antiphonal singing, the verses are sung alternately by soloist and choir, or by choir and congregation. It is probable that even in the early period the two methods caused the differentiation in the style of musical composition which is observed throughout the later history of plain chant, the choral compositions being of a simple kind, the solo compositions more elaborate, using a more extended compass of melodies and longer groups of notes on single syllables. The last type of plainsong performance is the solo performed by the choir or the individual performer. A marked feature in plainchant is the use of the same melody for various texts. This is quite typical for the ordinary psalmody in which the same formula, the \"psalm tone\", is used for all the verses of a psalm, just as in a hymn or a folk song the same melody is used for the various stanzas.\nGregorian chant is a variety of plainsong named after Pope Gregory I (6th century AD), but Gregory did not invent the chant. The tradition linking Gregory I to the development of the chant seems to rest on a possibly mistaken identification of a certain \"Gregorius\", probably Pope Gregory II, with his more famous predecessor. The term Gregorian Chant is often incorrectly used as a synonym of plainsong.\nFor several centuries, different plainchant styles existed concurrently. Standardization on Gregorian chant was not completed, even in Italy, until the 12th century. Plainchant represents the first revival of musical notation after knowledge of the ancient Greek system was lost.\nIn the late 9th century, plainsong began to evolve into organum, which led to the development of polyphony. When polyphony reached its climax in the sixteenth century, the use of plainsong chant was less appealing and almost completely abandoned.\nThere was a significant plainsong revival in the 19th century, when much work was done to restore the correct notation and performance-style of the old plainsong collections, notably by the monks of Solesmes Abbey, in northern France. After the Second Vatican Council and the introduction of the vernacular Mass, use of plainsong in the Catholic Church declined and was mostly confined to the monastic orders and to ecclesiastical societies celebrating the traditional Latin Mass (also called \"Tridentine Mass\"). Since Pope Benedict XVI's \"motu proprio\", \"Summorum Pontificum\", use of the Tridentine rite has increased; this, along with other papal comments on the use of appropriate liturgical music, is promoting a new plainsong revival.\nThe Plainsong and Medieval Music Society was founded in 1888 to promote the performance and study of liturgical chant and medieval polyphony.\nInterest in plainsong picked up in 1950s Britain, particularly in the left-wing religious and musical groups associated with Gustav Holst and the writer George B. Chambers. In the late 1980s, plainchant achieved a certain vogue as music for relaxation, and several recordings of plainchant became \"classical-chart hits\".\nChant types and traditions.\nThere are different types of plainchant. Syllabic chants are the simplest chants; they one note per syllable for most of the text. Hymns, and some sections of the mass such as the Gloria and Credo are typically set to syllabic chants. Neumatic chants have multiple notes for each syllable. These are often used for short texts such as introits, and the Sanctus and Agnus Dei of the mass. Finally, some chants combine a syllabic setting with occasional use of melismas \u2013 a sequence of multiple note on a single syllable. In the example above, there is a nine-note melisma on the first syllable of the word \"eleison\".\nGregorian chant is widely used today, but through much of its history plainchant had distinct local varieties, linked to differences in the form and content of church services. In England, the Sarum rite had its own associated chant, for example. Other chant traditions included the Ambrosian and Visigothic. Some monastic orders had their own chant, such as the Dominicans. \nComposers.\nPlainchant is typically anonymous, as befits music composed for worship. Among the few identifiable composers are Adam of Saint Victor (c.1068 \u2013 1146), a prolific composer of latin hymns, Hildegard of Bingen, a nun who lived in the 12th century, who composed 71 Latin liturgical pieces and Henri Dumont, who published five plainchant mass settings in 1660. Notker Balbulus (Notker the Stammerer) who lived from about 840 to 912, composed hymn chants and sequences, and Hermannus Contractus (Hermann of Reichenau, 1013\u20131054) is identified as the composer of several well-loved chants including the \"Salve Regina\" and the \"Alma Redemptoris Mater.\" \nModes.\nPlainchant employs a distinctive system of modes and this is used to work out the relative pitches of each line on the staff. It is distinct from the modal system used in ancient greek music. \nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

The city is located at the confluence of the Oka and the Volga rivers in Central Russia, with a population of over 1.2 million residents, and roughly 1.7 million residents in the wider urban area. Nizhny Novgorod is the sixth-largest city in Russia, and the second-most populous city on the Volga and Volga Federal District. The city is located 420 kilometers (260\u00a0mi) east of Moscow. It is an important economic, architectural, educational and cultural centre in Russia and the Volga-Vyatka Economic Region, and provides the majority of Russia's river tourism.\nThe city was founded on 4 February 1221 by Prince George II of Vladimir. In 1612, Kuzma Minin and Prince Dmitry Pozharsky organized an army for the liberation of Moscow from the Poles and Lithuanians. In 1817, Nizhny Novgorod became a great trade centre of the Russian Empire. In 1896, at the trade centre, an All-Russia Exhibition was organized. During the Soviet period, the city turned into an important industrial centre, and was known as Gorky. In particular, the Gorky Automobile Plant was constructed in this period. Around this time, the city was given the nickname \"Russian Detroit\". Shortly before the dissolution of the Soviet Union the city was renamed Nizhny Novgorod once again. In 1985, the Nizhny Novgorod Metro was opened. In 2016, Vladimir Putin opened the new 70th Anniversary of Victory Plant, which is part of the Almaz-Antey Air and Space Defence Corporation.\nThe Kremlin \u2013 the historic centre of the city \u2013 contains the main government agencies of the city and the Volga Federal District. The demonym for a Nizhny Novgorod resident is () for men or () for women, rendered in English as \"Nizhegorodian\". \"Novgorodian\" is improper, as it refers to a resident of Veliky Novgorod. Nizhny Novgorod was one of the host cities of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nHistory.\nName.\nOriginally, the name was just \"Novgorod\" ('Newtown'), but to distinguish it from the other, older and well-known Novgorod (Veliky Novgorod) to the west, the city was commonly called \"Novgorod of the Lower Lands\", or \"Lower Newtown\". The city and surrounding land is called \"lower\" (; ), even though it is actually higher in altitude than Veliky Novgorod, because it is situated downstream of other Russian cities such as Moscow, Vladimir and Murom.\nFrom 1932 to 1990, the city was known as Gorky (, ).\nSeat of medieval princes.\nThe city traces its origin from a small Russian wooden hillfort that was founded by grand prince Yuri II of Vladimir in 1221 at the confluence of two of the most important rivers in his principality, the Volga and Oka rivers. It marked the eastern extreme of East Slavic settlement until the end of the medieval period, with Russian expansion eastward delayed until the capture of Kazan in 1552.\nThe independent existence of the medieval fort was threatened by the continuous Mordvin attacks against it; the major attempt made by forces under Purgaz in April 1229 was repulsed. After the death of Yuri II on 4 March 1238 at the Battle of the Sit River, the Mongols occupied the fortress. Later a major stronghold for border protection, the fortress of Nizhny Novgorod took advantage of a natural moat formed by the two rivers.\nAlong with Moscow and Tver, Nizhny Novgorod was among several newly founded towns that escaped devastation during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus' on account of their insignificance, but grew into great centres in Russian political life during the hegemony of the Golden Horde. With the agreement of the Khan, Nizhny Novgorod was incorporated into the Vladimir-Suzdal Principality in 1264. After 86 years its importance further increased when the seat of the powerful Suzdal Principality was moved there from Gorodets in 1350. Grand Duke Dmitry Konstantinovich (1323\u20131383) sought to make his capital a rival worthy of Moscow; he built a stone citadel and several churches and was a patron of historians. The earliest extant manuscript of the \"Primary Chronicle\", the \"Laurentian Codex\", was written for him by the local monk Laurentius in 1377.\nFortress city.\nAfter the city's incorporation into the Grand Principality of Moscow in 1392, the local princes took the name Shuysky and settled in Moscow, where they were prominent at the court and briefly ascended the throne in the person of Vasily I of Moscow. After being burnt by the powerful Crimean Tatar chief Edigu in 1408, Nizhny Novgorod was restored and regarded by the Muscovites primarily as a great stronghold in their wars against the Tatars of Kazan. The enormous red-brick Kremlin, one of the strongest and earliest preserved citadels in Russia, was built in 1508\u20131511 under the supervision of Pietro Francesco. The fortress was strong enough to withstand Tatar sieges in 1520 and 1536.\nIn 1612, the so-called \"national militia\", gathered by a local merchant, Kuzma Minin, and commanded by Knyaz Dmitry Pozharsky expelled the Polish troops from Moscow, thus putting an end to the Time of Troubles and establishing the rule of the Romanov dynasty. The main square in front of the Kremlin is named after Minin and Pozharsky, although it is locally known simply as Minin Square. Minin's remains are buried in the citadel. In commemoration of these events, on 21 October 2005, an exact copy of the Red Square statue of Minin and Pozharsky was placed in front of St John the Baptist Church, which is believed to be the place from where the call to the people had been proclaimed.\nIn the course of the following century, the city prospered commercially and was chosen by the Stroganovs, the wealthiest merchant family of Russia, as a base for their operations. A particular style of architecture and icon painting, known as the Stroganov school, developed there at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe historical coat of arms of Nizhny Novgorod in 1781 was a red deer with black horns and hooves on a white field. The modern coat of arms from 2006 is the same, with a ribbon of order of Lenin and gold crown from above.\nCommercial centre.\nIn 1817, the Makaryev Fair, one of the liveliest in the world, was transferred to Nizhny Novgorod and started to attract millions of visitors annually. By the mid-19th century, the city was firmly established as the trade capital of the Russian Empire. The world's first radio receiver by engineer Alexander Popov and the world's first hyperboloid tower and lattice shell-coverings by engineer Vladimir Shukhov were demonstrated at the All-Russia industrial and art exhibition in Nizhny Novgorod in 1896. According to official Imperial Russian statistics, the population of Nizhny Novgorod as of 14 January 1913 was 97,000.\nThe largest industrial enterprise was the Sormovo Iron Works which was connected by the company's own railway to Moskovsky railway station in the Lower City of Nizhny Novgorod. The Kazansky railway station was in the Upper city. Other industries gradually developed, and by the start of the 20th century, the city was also a first-rank industrial hub. Henry Ford helped build a large truck and tractor plant (GAZ) in the late 1920s, sending engineers and mechanics, including future labour leader Walter Reuther.\nSoviet era.\nThere are four monuments to those executed in the city between 1918 and 1945: two mark sites where victims were killed and buried during the Russian Civil War, at the Pochainsky and Gendarmes Ravines. The others mark sites in the city at the Bugrovskoe and the Marina Roshcha cemeteries, where those executed or who died in prison were buried.\nThere were no permanent bridges over the Volga or Oka before the October Revolution in 1917. Temporary bridges were built during the trade fair. The first bridge over the Volga was started by the Moscow\u2013Kazan Railway Company in 1914, but only finished in the Soviet Era when the railway to Kotelnich was opened for service in 1927.\nThe Marxist activist and Tsarist dissident Maxim Gorky was born in Nizhny Novgorod in 1868 as Alexey Maximovich Peshkov. In his novels he described the dismal life of the city proletariat. When he returned to the Soviet Union in 1932 on the invitation of Joseph Stalin, the city was renamed Gorky. The city bore Gorky's name until 1990. His childhood home is preserved as a museum, known as the Kashirin House, after Alexey's grandfather who owned the place.\nDuring World War II, from 1941 to 1943, Gorky was subjected to air raids and bombardments by Germany. The Germans tried to destroy the city industry because it was a major supplier of military equipment to the front. Of the attacks made in the rear of the Soviet Union, these became the most powerful in the entire duration of the war.\nDuring much of the Soviet era, the city was closed to foreigners to safeguard the security of Soviet military research and production facilities, even though it was a popular stopping point for Soviet tourists travelling up and down the Volga in tourist boats. Unusually for a Soviet city of that size, even street maps were not available for sale until the mid-1970s. In 1970, by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the city was awarded the Order of Lenin. M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi, the former Stalinist General Secretary of Hungary's communist party, died in exile there in 1971. On 20 November 1985, in the city the first section of the metro was launched. The physicist and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Andrei Sakharov was exiled there during 1980\u20131986 to limit his contacts with foreigners. An end to the \"closed\" status of the city accompanied the reinstatement of the city's original name in 1990.\nPost-Soviet era.\nThe 800th anniversary of Nizhny Novgorod was celebrated on 21 August 2021. It celebrated the history and the great people who came from the city. The climax of the celebration was the city's 800th Anniversary Gala Show. Natalia Vodianova gave a speech and Vladimir Putin was in attendance. The Central Bank of Russia issued commemorative coins to honor the 800th anniversary.\nAdministrative and municipal status.\nNizhny Novgorod is the administrative centre (capital) of Volga Federal District and Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. Within the framework of administrative divisions, it is, together with one resort settlement and twelve rural localities, incorporated as the city of oblast significance of Nizhny Novgorod\u2014an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Nizhny Novgorod is incorporated as Nizhny Novgorod Urban Okrug.\nIn December 2011, Marat Safin was elected to the Russian Parliament as a member of Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party, representing Nizhny Novgorod.\nCity layout and divisions.\nNizhny Novgorod is divided by the Oka River into two distinct parts. The Upper City (, \"Nagornaya chast\", \"Mountainous part\") is located on the hilly eastern (right) bank of the Oka. It includes three of the eight city districts into which the city is administratively divided:\nThe Lower City (, \"Zarechnaya chast\", \"Over river part\") occupies the low (western) side of the Oka, and includes five city districts:\nAll of today's lower city was annexed by Nizhny Novgorod in 1929\u20131931.\nDemographics.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Module:Historical populations/styles.css\"/&gt;\nNizhny Novgorod has a population of 1,228,199 within city limits and two million in the urban agglomeration, making it the sixth-largest city in Russia, ranking after Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg and Kazan.\nRussians make up 94.8% of the city's population.

There are no direct elections of the mayor for city residents. The mayor is appointed by the decision of the City Duma. Since 28 October 2020, Yuri Shalabaev has been the mayor of Nizhny Novgorod.\nDistrict heads are not elected.\nPolitics.\nFrom 1991 to 2009, the mayor of the city was elected by the townspeople for a term of 5 years. During this time, four people have been in this post: Dmitry Bednyakov, Ivan Sklyarov, Yuri Lebedev, Vadim Bulavinov (twice).\nIn recent years, the role of the regional government headed by the governor in city affairs has significantly increased.\nOn 25 October 2010, the position of mayor was abolished and instead two formal positions appeared\u2014the head of the city and the head of the administration. Oleg Sorokin was elected mayor of the city. At an extraordinary meeting of the City Duma on 3 December 2010, Oleg Kondrashov was approved as the head of the administration of Nizhny Novgorod.\nOn 22 July 2015, by the decision of the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod, Kondrashov was removed from his post.

On 7 March 2019, the Nizhny Novgorod District Court sentenced him to 10 years in a strict regime colony with a fine of 460.8 million rubles.\nOn 7 October 2015, Ivan Karnilin became the head of the city. In December 2016, opposition blogger Alexei Navalny published a video of his investigation, featuring Karnilin as the hero. As it turned out, it is possible that his ex-wife bought two apartments in Miami in 2013 and 2014 for a total of almost $2 million. On 23 May 2017, Karnilin wrote a letter of resignation, which was adopted by the City Duma. All this time, an anti-corruption check was going on, which began long before the \"investigation\" of Alexei Navalny.\nAfter Ivan Karnilin, the last position of the head of the city was held by Elizaveta Solonchenko, who held it from 21 June to 20 December 2017. After that, the post of mayor of the city returned, which was taken by Vladimir Panov. He held this position from 17 January 2018 to 6 May 2020. Panov resigned ahead of schedule in connection with the transfer to a new position of Deputy Chairman of the State Commission for the Development of the Arctic.\nSince 6 May 2020, Yury Shalabaev has taken the post of mayor. He introduced the practice of weekly online meetings with city residents in his Telegram channel. This significantly affected the speed of execution of various instructions and control. Shalabaev works closely with Governor Gleb Nikitin.

On 15 July 1822 the largest Nizhny Novgorod fair was solemnly opened on the left bank of the Oka. Then Nizhny Novgorod became the main city of all-Russian and international trade. In 1929, the Fair was closed, and the city's economy began to develop in a completely different direction.\nThe Soviet city of Gorky became one of the largest industrial centres in Russia, the leading role in which belonged to the enterprises of mechanical engineering, metalworking and information technology. At the same time, the first auto giant, the Gorky Automobile Plant, was built.\nThe very foundation of the city at the confluence of two navigable rivers predetermined both its military-strategic and commercial significance. Local merchants traded not only with Moscow, Kazan, Yaroslavl, Astrakhan, but also with the cities of Europe and Central Asia. In May 1767, during the royal visit of Empress Catherine II, she ordered the creation of a new enterprise, the Nizhny Novgorod Trading Company.\nThe main factor in the formation of Nizhny Novgorod as the main trading centre of Russia at the beginning of the 19th century was the transfer here in 1817 of the Makariev Fair.\nAt the expense of the treasury, under the general project and under the leadership of Augustine de Betancourt, the largest guest complex in Europe was created. At the stage before 1822, the Cathedral of the Savior was built according to the project of Auguste de Montferrand, 3 administrative, 4 \"Chinese\" wooden and 56 brick buildings with thousands of shops, hotels, taverns and a summer theatre. For the first time in Europe, sewerage was provided here. At the second stage, the complex of the Cathedral of the Savior was completed, a mosque and an Armenian-Gregorian church were built. The third stage marked a strict rectangular redevelopment of the fair with the paving of all streets, the creation of a number of new places of worship, including the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, a three-story commercial building, called the Persian Caravanserai, was erected near the mosque. The fourth stage was the last in a series of reconstructions and included: the construction of the stone circus of the Nikitin brothers, the Brazilian passage on theatre Square, the new Main Fair House in the Russian style, which became one of the largest passages of the Russian Empire.\nThe current Nizhny Novgorod fair is an interactive museum. The inauguration of the governor and various official events are held in the armorial hall.\nCurrently, trade in Nizhny Novgorod is represented mainly by its retail sector. In the 1990s, Belinsky Street was actively built up with shopping centres.

It took first place among Russian cities and 109th in the world in terms of quality of life. The rating was compiled by the website numbeo.com, which specializes in statistics on the cost of living and consumer prices in different countries of the world.

Currently, the city's main bus terminals are the following:\nOut of the three bus terminals, only the Kanavino station is near a subway line; the other two are connected with the rest of the city by city buses.\nAerial cableway.\nIn 2012, the cableway connecting Nizhny Novgorod and Bor was launched. The length of the cableway is . It has the largest unsupported span in Europe above the water surface, which is . The main purpose is to provide an alternative type of passenger transportation in addition to river taxis, electric trains and buses. The cable car has also become a popular tourist attraction, thanks to panoramic views from the cabins.\nNot far from Nizhegorodskaya station there are the Nizhny Novgorod Cathedral Mosque and Pechersky Ascension Monastery.\nAround from the Borskaya station is the park of historical reconstruction of \"Pax Romana\", which represents a collective image of a site of the Roman borderland at the turn of the 1st\u20132nd centuries AD, with a military camp and a small town that developed from the Marktant village at the camp.

{"id": "65431", "revid": "31696229", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65431", "title": "Accrington Stanley F.C.", "text": "Association football club in England\nFootball club\nAccrington Stanley Football Club is a professional association football club based in Accrington, Lancashire, England, that compete in the EFL League Two, the fourth level of the English football league system. They have spent their entire history playing at the Crown Ground and traditionally play in red shirts, most often also with red shorts and socks. The club is known as Accrington Stanley, Stanley or just Accrington. \nThe club came to national prominence in 1989 due to the Milk Marketing Board's popular television advert that featured the slogan \"Accrington Stanley, who are they?\"\nThe current club was formed in 1968, two years after the collapse of the original Accrington Stanley. The original club was founded in 1891 and played in the Football League from 1921 to 1962 after initially competing in the Lancashire Combination. The town's original club, named simply Accrington, were founder members of the Football League in 1888, but folded six years later. The current incarnation of the club entered the Lancashire Combination and moved on to the Cheshire County League after winning the Combination title in 1977\u201378. Stanley won Division Two of the Cheshire County League in 1980\u201381 and became founder members of the North West Counties League in 1982, before being placed in Division One of the Northern Premier League five years later. After promotion to the Premier Division in 1990\u201391, Stanley were relegated in 1999.\nThe early 21st century saw the club win three promotions in seven seasons under the stewardship of John Coleman to gain a place in the Football League. They won three divisional titles in each of their three promotions: Northern Premier League Division One (1999\u20132000), Northern Premier League Premier Division (2002\u201303) and the Conference National (2005\u201306). This marked the return of Accrington to the professional league system after 44 years. They then spent 12 seasons mostly in the bottom half of the table in League Two, though did also lose two play-off semi-finals, before Coleman led them to promotion to League One as League Two champions in 2017\u201318. The club was relegated to League Two in 2022\u201323.\nHistory.\nRe-formation (1968\u20132003).\nAccrington had been without a football team following the collapse of the original Accrington Stanley in 1966. The original team had been formed in 1891 and played in the Football League from 1921 to March 1962, but had spent its final four seasons in the Lancashire Combination. At a meeting at Bold Street Working Men's Club in 1968 the revival was initiated, and in August 1970 the new club played at a new ground, the Crown Ground. Eric Whalley, a local businessman, took control of the club in 1995 and began the development of the club's ground. After the club was relegated in 1999, Whalley appointed John Coleman as manager.\nThe club's rise to the Football League is attributed in part to the windfall of hundreds of thousands of pounds reaped by the sell-on clause in the December 2001 transfer of former Stanley star Brett Ormerod to Southampton, which paid Blackpool over a million pounds for his contract. Stanley had taken \u00a350,000 from Blackpool in 1997, with the agreement that Blackpool would pay Accrington a quarter of what it might have received if it in turn transferred Ormerod to another team. The 2002\u201303 championship of the Northern Premier League followed quickly on Accrington getting the cash.\nConference years (2003\u20132006).\nIn May 2003, the club was promoted for the first time in its history to the Football Conference after winning the Northern Premier League championship. The club's first game in the league was away to another reformed club, Aldershot Town, on Sunday 10 August 2003. The game was shown live on Sky Sports and Accrington lost 2\u20131. The club finished their first fifth-tier season in 10th position; a highlight was a run to the FA Cup 3rd round, losing in a replay at League One side Colchester United.\nIn 2004, Accrington Stanley turned professional. The following 2004\u201305 season, Stanley again achieved a final position of 10th, with Paul Mullin among the top goal scorers, with 20 goals. The club was also one of 12 Conference sides to played in the Football League Trophy, winning at Bradford City in September 2004.\nStanley's stay in the Conference did not last long, with the club being promoted to the Football League at the end of the 2005\u201306 season. The club had a 19-game unbeaten run from October to March, and finished on 91 points, leaving the club an easy passage to League Two. Mullin, Rob Elliot and Gary Roberts led the club back to the league after 46 years away.\nReturn to the Football League (2006\u2013present).\nThe club's first Football League game was on 5 August 2006, a 2\u20130 defeat at Chester City. Accrington fought a relegation battle throughout its first fourth-tier season. Five wins in the last nine games of the season led to a 20th-place finish and was enough to avoid relegation. Highlights of that first season back included the club's first-ever Football League Cup match against former European Cup winners Nottingham Forest. A 1\u20130 win led the club to a second-round away tie against then Premier League team Watford, which Stanley lost 6\u20135 on penalties after a 0\u20130 draw and extra-time. In the Football League Trophy for the first time as a league club, Accrington defeated Carlisle United and Blackpool in the early rounds, but were knocked out by Doncaster Rovers in the Area Quarter-finals.\nThe 2007\u201308 season saw the club involved in another relegation battle with strugglers Chester City, Wrexham and Mansfield Town. Five wins in the final 12 games were enough to secure a 17th-place finish and another fourth-tier season. However, the club failed to win a game in the FA Cup and League Cup, losing to Huddersfield Town and Leicester City respectively.\nPerformances during the 2008\u201309 season improved slightly, with the club achieving a 16th-place finish in League Two, with six League wins in the last 12 games. Young prospect Bobby Grant finally fulfilled the early promise seen in previous seasons. The club again failed to make it past the early round of any of the domestic cups, losing in the first round to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the League Cup and Tranmere Rovers in both the FA Cup (albeit after a replay) and Football League Trophy.\nThe 2009\u201310 season was better, with the club pushing for a play-off place at the turn of the year. Nine wins in 10 League games saw the club with a chance of making the play-offs, only for this to fade in March/April. The partnership of Michael Symes and Bobby Grant was a key aspect but, following their achievements throughout the season, both moved on to bigger clubs. In terms of cup performance the club reached the 2nd round of the League Cup (losing 2\u20131 to Queens Park Rangers), the quarter-finals of the Football League Trophy (losing 2\u20130 to Leeds United), and the 4th round of the FA Cup (losing 3\u20131 to Premier League team Fulham).\nThe club reached the Football League Two play-offs during the 2010\u201311 season, one of the most successful in its history. One defeat in 19 games from February to May saw the club finish in 5th position, eventually losing to League Two newcomers Stevenage in the play-off semi-finals. The season saw the emergence of Jimmy Ryan as a star in the making, along with goalkeeper Alex Cisak and midfielder Sean McConville. In the domestic cups, Stanley reached the second round of the League Cup (losing 3\u20132 to Premier League team Newcastle United). The club won its first-round game in the Football League Trophy away to Tranmere Rovers, but was then forced to resign from the competition having fielded the ineligible Ray Putterill. The club also reached the second round of the FA Cup, but lost to fellow League Two side Port Vale.\nThe 2011\u201312 season was one of transition for the club. The loss of six of the playoff-chasing side of the previous season meant a shaky start but the arrival of Bryan Hughes in October transformed the club's fortunes, and six wins in seven games over the Christmas period saw the club briefly enter the play-offs. However, following the sale of club captain Andrew Procter to Preston North End in the January 2012 transfer window, the third-longest serving management team of John Coleman and Jimmy Bell departed for Rochdale. Former Burnley and club favourite Paul Cook was brought in as manager, with Leam Richardson promoted from caretaker manager to full-time assistant. But the club finished the season with just three wins in the final 17 games, ending in 14th position. Stanley exited the League Cup and FA Cup at the first round stages, losing to Scunthorpe United and Notts County respectively. The club reached the second round of the Football League Trophy, after knocking out holders Carlisle United, but lost to Tranmere Rovers in the second round after a replay following a serious head injury to defender Thomas Bender in the initial tie.\nAndy Holt's stewardship (2015\u2013present).\nIn July 2015, local businessman Andy Holt attended Stanley's pre-season friendly at home against local rivals Burnley, which they won 4\u20132. It was during this game that Holt got an insight into the dire state of Stanley, discovering the club's bar was unable to serve spectators due to a failure to pay its suppliers. On 28 October 2015, Accrington Stanley's board voted to approve Holt's takeover of the club. Holt, whose company What More UK sponsored, and still sponsor, Stanley's Wham Stadium, attained a majority share of 75% in Accrington Stanley, in return for clearing the club's \u00a31.2m debt as well as providing the club with further funds of \u00a3600,000. Stanley's chairman, Peter Marsden, remained as chairman whilst five new people joined the club's board. At the time of the takeover, Stanley had been on the verge of folding due to crippling debts and its inability to fund day-to-day running costs, including wages and its suppliers. Due to its precarious financial situation, the club had been accepting sponsorship deals at a value lower than what should have been demanded.\nDuring Holt's first season as owner of the club, the 2015\u201316 Football League Two season, the club narrowly missed out on automatic promotion to League One on the final day of the season, having been held to a 0\u20130 draw with Stevenage. Stanley were then defeated in the semi-final of the League Two play-offs, losing 3\u20132 on aggregate to eventual play-off victors AFC Wimbledon. At the end of the season, Stanley lost several players who had helped the promotion push, such as Tom Davies, Ross Etheridge and Josh Windass, who had agreed contracts with clubs able to offer higher wages than Stanley. With Windass and Crooks being under 24, Stanley received \u00a3120,000 for the duo's transfer to Rangers.\nDuring the 2016\u201317 pre-season, Stanley improved facilities at the Crown Ground, replacing vendors with its own in-house service, and Stanley's chairman, Marsden, stepped down after a decade in the role. Marsden was replaced by Holt in the position. In the following 2016\u201317 season, Stanley finished mid-table in 13th position, having struggled to replicate its promotion push from the season before. The club had, however, enjoyed a run to the fourth round of the FA Cup, with a 1\u20130 defeat away to Middlesbrough ending their cup campaign.\nAt the end of the 2017\u201318 season, Stanley won the League Two championship, with their 2\u20130 win over Yeovil Town on 17 April 2018 sealing promotion. In their first season in League One, the club finished in 14th place.\nStanley were relegated to League Two in 2022\u201323 after finishing second from bottom in League One. In March 2024, John Coleman was sacked as manager after nine and a half years in the role. John Doolan then took over, finishing the 2023\u201324 season in 17th place and the following season in 21st place. In May 2025, Holt stepped down as chairman, and the club announced it was closing its academy, blaming \"significant financial challenges\", despite an offer from the local council to fund the academy for 12 months.\nName.\nThe original town club, Accrington, was amongst the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888, before resigning from the league after just five years. A team called Stanley Villa already existed at the time, named as such because they were based at the Stanley Working Men's Club on Stanley Street in Accrington. With the demise of Accrington, Stanley Villa took the town name to become Accrington Stanley.\nStadium.\nSince leaving Peel Park, the club has played at the Crown Ground, currently known as the Wham Stadium as part of a three-year \u00a3200,000 sponsorship deal with What More UK Ltd.\nPrior to Holt's takeover of Stanley, the Crown Ground had a reputation for being one of the poorest grounds within the top four leagues of English football. However, Holt's stewardship of the club lead to changes at the Crown Ground, with initial changes including improved match day facilities before the construction of a new Whinney Hill Stand, which was built and completed in late-2018.\nThe following season, Stanley invested around \u00a3300,000 in a new playing field, a move which saw new drainage and a levelled pitch installed to overcome the club's issue with recurring flooding towards the Coppice End.\nIn January 2021, work begun on the construction of a new and improved Jack Barrett Stand, work which will see a new bar and hospitality area provided as part of the plans.\nRivalries.\nAccording to a survey conducted in August 2019, Stanley supporters consider traditional Lancashire clubs Rochdale, Morecambe and Bury to be their biggest rivals, with near neighbours Blackburn Rovers and Burnley following.\nTelevision advertisement.\nIn the 1980s, the club was mentioned in a British advert for milk, which briefly brought the club to the attention of the general public. The advertisement featured two boys in Liverpool replica shirts played by young actors Carl Rice and Kevin Spaine. It made reference to Accrington Stanley's obscurity in comparison to Liverpool's success at the time.\nBoy 1: \"Milk! Urghh!\"\nBoy 2: \"It's what Ian Rush drinks.\"\nBoy 1: \"Ian Rush?\"\nBoy 2: \"Yeah. And he said if I didn't drink lots of milk, when I grow up, I'll only be good enough to play for Accrington Stanley.\"\nBoy 1: \"Accrington Stanley, who are they?\"\nBoy 2: \"Exactly.\"\nIn the former weekly football show, \"Soccer AM\", the phrase \"Accrington Stanley, who are they?\" is said every time a fixture is read out that has the club in it, referring to the milk advert.\n \"As of 1 September 2025\"&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nPlayers.\nOut on loan.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nRetired numbers.\nIn January 2020, Stanley icon Billy Kee announced his retirement from professional football, having battled with mental health issues that had seen Kee last appear for Stanley the previous season. In honour of the forward, Stanley announced that they were to retire Kee's 29 shirt number.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Football squad player/styles.css\" /&gt;\nFormer players.\nIn a PFA Fans' Favourites survey published by the Professional Footballers' Association in December 2007, Chris Grimshaw was listed as the all-time favourite player amongst Accrington Stanley fans.\nSource:\nHonours.\nLeague\nCup\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65432", "revid": "2842084", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65432", "title": "David Tudor", "text": "David Eugene Tudor (January 20, 1926 \u2013 August 13, 1996) was an American pianist and composer of experimental music.\nLife and career.\nTudor was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He studied piano with Irma Wolpe and composition with Stefan Wolpe and became known as one of the leading performers of avant garde piano music. He gave the first American performance of the \"Piano Sonata No. 2\" by Pierre Boulez in 1950, and a European tour in 1954 greatly enhanced his reputation. Karlheinz Stockhausen dedicated his \"Klavierst\u00fcck VI\" (1955) to Tudor. Tudor also gave early performances of works by Morton Feldman, Earle Brown, Christian Wolff and La Monte Young.\nThe composer with whom Tudor is particularly associated is John Cage; he gave the premiere of Cage's \"Music of Changes\", \"Concert For Piano and Orchestra\" and the notorious \"4' 33\"\". Cage said that many of his pieces were written either specifically for Tudor to perform or with him in mind, once stating \"what you had to do was to make a situation that would interest \"him\". That was the role he played.\" The two worked closely together on many of Cage's pieces, both works for piano and electronic pieces, including for the Smithsonian Folkways album: \"Indeterminacy: New Aspect of Form in Instrumental and Electronic Music (1959)\". Tudor also performs on several recordings of Cage's music, including the Mainstream record of \"Cartridge Music\", the recording on Columbia Records of \"Variations II\", and the two Everest records of \"Variations IV\". Tudor selected the works to be performed for the 25th Anniversary Retrospective Concert of the music of John Cage (May 16, 1958), and performed in the premiere of the \"Concert For Piano and Orchestra\" given as the closing work for that concert. Moreover, Tudor received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (1992).\nAfter a stint teaching at Darmstadt from 1956 to 1961, Tudor began to wind up his activities as a pianist to concentrate on composing. He wrote mostly electronic works, many commissioned by Cage's partner, choreographer Merce Cunningham. His homemade musical circuits are considered landmarks in live electronic music and electrical instrument building as a form of composition. One piece, \"Reunion\" (1968), written jointly with Lowell Cross, features a chess game where each move triggers a lighting effect or projection. At the premiere, the game was played between John Cage and Marcel Duchamp. \"Reunion\" is erroneously attributed to Cage in James Pritchett's book \"The Music Of John Cage\". \"Rain Forest\" is a sound installation created from constructed sculpture and everyday objects such as a metal barrel, a vintage computer disk, and plastic tubing which served as a musical accompaniment. (David Tudor and Composers Inside Electronics Inc.: Rain forest V (variation 1))\nIn 1969, Tudor set up India's first electronic music studio at the National Institute of Design in Ahmedabad.\nUpon Cage's death in 1992, Tudor took over as music director of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company. Among many works created for the company, Tudor composed \"Soundings: Ocean Diary\" (1994), the electronic component of \"Ocean\", which was conceived by John Cage and Merce Cunningham, with choreography by Merce Cunningham, orchestral music by Andrew Culver and design by Marsha Skinner.\nTudor died after a series of strokes in Tomkins Cove, New York at the age of 70.\nPiano realisations.\nFrom 1951 until the late 1960s, Tudor (mainly as pianist) regularly performed the indeterminate work of John Cage. Throughout this time, \"all of the music [Cage] composed\", John Holzaepfel contends, \"was written with one person in mind\", and this person was Tudor. The culmination of this period were works that required a significant imprint of Tudor in performance. \"Winter Music\" (1957), for example, comprises a score of twenty pages, that each contain from one to 61 cluster-chords per page, with the performer deciding which of these to play. In his realisations of these scores, Tudor \"pin[ned] them down like butterflies\", making the indeterminate determined, such that each performance of these works was consistent with the last. He chose to 'fix' his interpretation, such that he never improvised from the score, and rather each performance of \"Winter Music\" by Tudor was consistent across time. As Martin Iddon explains: \"Tudor's practice was, broadly, to create a single realisation and then to use that version of the piece in all subsequent recordings\".\nDespite the significant role Tudor had in the creative act, \"during his years as a pianist, Tudor never considered himself as a composer, or even a co-composer, of the music he played\".\nHowever, Benjamin Piekut argues differently, drawing from the work of Bruno Latour. These fixed realisations are examples of 'distributed authorship' where \"the conception, meaning and sound-world of a given composition is shared across multiple subjectivities\". The conception and meaning of the work for Cage is always created with Tudor in mind, and thus shared across the subjectivities of these two actors. Similarly, the output 'sound-world' is shared in that Tudor's function in realising the score is decision making based on Cage's stimuli (score), and Cage's stimuli does not present a coherent sound-world on its own. Piekut goes on to align this creative-distribution with Cage's Buddhist anti-ego worldview.\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
{"id": "65433", "revid": "46967642", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65433", "title": "Patagonia", "text": "Geographical region in South America\nPatagonia () is a geographical region in southern South America that spans parts of Argentina and Chile. It includes the southern portion of the Andes mountain range, featuring lakes, fjords, temperate rainforests, and glaciers in the west, and deserts, tablelands, and steppes toward the east. The region is bounded by the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and several waterways that connect them, including the Strait of Magellan, the Beagle Channel, and the Drake Passage to the south.\nThe northern limit of the region is not precisely defined; the Colorado and Barrancas rivers, which run from the Andes to the Atlantic, are commonly considered the northern limit of Argentine Patagonia; on this basis the extent of Patagonia could be defined as the provinces of Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, together with Patagones Partido in the far south of Buenos Aires Province. The archipelago of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes considered part of Patagonia. Most geographers and historians locate the northern limit of Chilean Patagonia at Huincul Fault, in Araucan\u00eda Region.\nWhen Spanish explorers first arrived, Patagonia was inhabited by several indigenous groups. In a small portion of northwestern Patagonia, some communities practiced limited agriculture, while in the remaining territory most peoples lived as hunter-gatherers\u2014travelling on foot in the eastern plains and using dugout canoes and dalcas in the western fjords and channels. During the colonial period, the indigenous groups of northeastern Patagonia adopted a horseback-based nomadic lifestyle following the introduction of the horse.\nAlthough Spain claimed Patagonia and conducted early explorations and a few small coastal settlements, the Spanish Crown was primarily concerned with preventing other European powers from establishing a presence in the region. After gaining independence, both Chile and Argentina asserted sovereignty over the southern territories and began to consolidate and colonize their claims throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. This expansion led to a severe decline in indigenous populations, whose societies were disrupted by incoming settlers from Argentina, the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, mainland Chile, and Europe. Indigenous resistance to colonization was ultimately suppressed through a series of military campaigns carried out by Argentina and Chile.\nThe contemporary economy of Argentine Patagonia is largely based on sheep farming and the extraction of oil and natural gas, while in Chilean Patagonia the economy is dominated by fishing, salmon aquaculture, and tourism.\nEtymology and toponomies.\nThe name Patagonia comes from the word \"patag\u00f3n\". Magellan used this term in 1520 to describe the native tribes of the region, whom his expedition thought to be giants. The people he called the Patagons are now believed to have been the Tehuelche, who tended to be taller than Europeans of the time. Argentine researcher Miguel Doura observed that the name Patagonia possibly derives from the ancient Greek region of modern Turkey called Paphlagonia, possible home of the \"patagon\" personage in the chivalric romances \"Primaleon\" printed in 1512, ten years before Magellan arrived in these southern lands. This hypothesis was published in a 2011 \"New Review of Spanish Philology\" report.\nThere are various placenames in the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago with Chono etymologies despite the main indigenous language of the archipelago at the arrival of the Spanish being Mapudungun. A theory postulated by chronicler Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Garc\u00eda explains this holding that the Cuncos (also known as Veliches) settled in Chilo\u00e9 Island in Pre-Hispanic times as a consequence of a push from more northern Huilliches who in turn were being displaced by Mapuches. While being outside traditional Huilliche territory the western Patagonian volcanoes Michimahuida, Hornopir\u00e9n and Chait\u00e9n have Huilliche etymologies.\nIn Chubut Province modern toponymy comes from the word \"chupat\" belonging to a transitional language between the southern and northern Tehuelche ethnic groups that were located in that region called Tews\u00fcn or Teushen. The word means transparency and is related to the clarity and purity of the river that bears that name and runs through the province. It is also related to the origin of the Welsh pronunciation of the word \"chupat\" which later became \"Chubut\". It is called \"Camwy\" in Patagonian Welsh. Chupat, Chubut and Camwy have the same meaning and are used to talk about the river and the province. Welsh settlers and placenames are associated with one of the projects of the country of Wales, Project Hiraeth.\nDue to the language, culture and location, many Patagonians do not consider themselves Latinos and proudly call themselves Patagonians instead. People from Y Wladfa, Laurie Island, the Atlantic Islands, Antarctica (including the Chilean town in Antarctica, \"The Stars Village\", and the Argentine civilian settlement, \"Hope Base\"), other non-Latin speaking areas use this term as a patriotic and inclusive demonym. A Patagonian is a person that is part of the Patagonia region, language and culture. That person could be a citizen from Chilean Patagonia, Argentine Patagonia, or of native communities that existed before the land was divided by The Boundary Treaty of 1881.\nPatagonia is divided between Western Patagonia (Chile) and Eastern Patagonia (Argentina) and several territories are still under dispute and claiming their rights. Mapuche people came from the Chilean Andes and voted to remain in different sides of Patagonia. Welsh settlers came from Wales and North America and voted to remain in Patagonia; when the treaty was signed, they voted for culture and administration to be apart from the country keeping the settlement, language, schools, traditions, regional dates, flag, anthems, and celebrations. Patagonians also live abroad in settlements like Saltcoats, Saskatchewan, Canada; New South Wales, Australia; South Africa; the Falkland Islands; and North America.\nPopulation and land area.\nArgentine Patagonia.\nEastern Patagonia consists of five Argentine provinces, together with a single \"partido\" (the most southern division) of Buenos Aires Province, all listed below with their areas and their populations at the censuses of 15 May 1991, 17 November 2000, 27 October 2010 and 16 May 2022:\nChilean Patagonia.\nWestern Patagonia at its greatest definition consists of four Chilean provinces, all listed below with their areas and their populations at the Censuses 0f 22 April 1992, 24 April 2002, 19 April 2017 and 9 March 2024: One a more limited definition, Chilean Patagonia comprises just the two more southern and least populated regions (Zona Austral) of Ays\u00e9n and Magallanes.\nNotes: (a) official name is Ays\u00e9n del General Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo. (b) official name is Magallanes y de la Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena,\nLargest cities.\nThe populations of Argentine cities and agglomerations are from the 2022 Census as referenced above. The populations of Chilean cities and agglomerations are from the 2017 Census as referenced above.\nNote: (a) the Neuqu\u00e9n \u2013 Plottier \u2013 Cipolletti Metropolitan area.\nPhysical geography.\nArgentine Patagonia is for the most part a region of steppe-like plains, rising in a succession of 13 abrupt terraces about at a time, and covered with an enormous bed of shingle almost bare of vegetation. In the hollows of the plains are ponds or lakes of fresh and brackish water. Towards Chilean territory, the shingle gives way to porphyry, granite, and basalt lavas, and animal life becomes more abundant. Vegetation is more luxuriant, consisting principally of southern beech and conifers. The high rainfall against the western Andes (Wet Andes) and the low sea-surface temperatures offshore give rise to cold and humid air masses, contributing to the ice fields and glaciers, the largest ice fields in the Southern Hemisphere outside of Antarctica.\nAmong the depressions by which the plateau is intersected transversely, the principal ones are the Gualichu, south of the R\u00edo Negro, the Maquinchao and Valcheta (through which previously flowed the waters of Nahuel Huapi Lake, which now feed the Limay River), the Senguerr (spelled Senguer on most Argentine maps and within the corresponding region), and the Deseado River. Besides these transverse depressions (some of them marking lines of ancient interoceanic communication), others were occupied by either more or less extensive lakes, such as the Yagagtoo, Musters, and Colhue Huapi, and others situated to the south of Puerto Deseado in the center of the country.\nAcross much of Patagonia east of the Andes, volcanic eruptions have created formation of basaltic lava plateaus during the Cenozoic. The plateaus are of different ages with the older \u2013of Neogene and Paleogene age\u2013 being located at higher elevations than Pleistocene and Holocene lava plateaus and outcrops.\nErosion, which is caused principally by the sudden melting and retreat of ice aided by tectonic changes, has scooped out a deep longitudinal depression, best in evidence where in contact with folded Cretaceous rocks, which are lifted up by the Cenozoic granite. It generally separates the plateau from the first lofty hills, whose ridges are generally called the pre-Cordillera. To the west of these, a similar longitudinal depression extends all along the foot of the snowy Andean Cordillera. This latter depression contains the richest, most fertile land of Patagonia. Lake basins along the Cordillera were also gradually excavated by ice streams, including Lake Argentino and Lake Fagnano, as well as coastal bays such as Bah\u00eda In\u00fatil.\nThe establishment of dams near the Andes in Argentina in the 20th century has led to a sediment shortage along the Atlantic coast of Patagonia.\nGeology.\nThe geological limit of Patagonia has been proposed to be Huincul Fault, which forms a major discontinuity. The fault truncates various structures including the Pampean orogen found further north. The ages of base rocks change abruptly across the fault. Discrepancies have been mentioned among geologists on the origin of the Patagonian landmass. V\u00edctor Ramos has proposed that the Patagonian landmass originated as an allochthonous terrane that separated from Antarctica and docked in South America 250 to 270 Mya in the Permian period. A 2014 study by R.J. Pankhurst and coworkers rejects any idea of a far-traveled Patagonia, claiming it is likely of parautochtonous (nearby) origin.\nThe Mesozoic and Cenozoic deposits have revealed a most interesting vertebrate fauna. This, together with the discovery of the perfect cranium of a turtle (chelonian) of the genus \"Niolamia\", which is almost identical to \"Ninjemys oweni\" of the Pleistocene age in Queensland, forms an evident proof of the connection between the Australian and South American continents. The Patagonian \"Niolamia\" belongs to the Sarmienti Formation. Fossils of the mid-Cretaceous \"Argentinosaurus\", which may be the largest of all dinosaurs, have been found in Patagonia, and a model of the mid-Jurassic \"Piatnitzkysaurus\" graces the concourse of the Trelew airport (the skeleton is in the Trelew paleontological museum; the museum's staff has also announced the discovery of a species of dinosaur even bigger than \"Argentinosaurus\"). Of more than paleontological interest, the middle Jurassic Los Molles Formation and the still richer late Jurassic (Tithonian) and early Cretaceous (Berriasian) Vaca Muerta formation above it in the Neuqu\u00e9n basin are reported to contain huge hydrocarbon reserves (mostly gas in Los Molles, both gas and oil in Vaca Muerta) partly accessible through hydraulic fracturing. Other specimens of the interesting fauna of Patagonia, belonging to the Middle Cenozoic, are the gigantic wingless birds, exceeding in size any hitherto known, and the singular mammal \"Pyrotherium\", also of very large dimensions. In the Cenozoic marine formation, considerable numbers of cetaceans have been discovered.\nDuring the Oligocene and early Miocene, large swathes of Patagonia were subject to a marine transgression, which might have temporarily linked the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, as inferred from the findings of marine invertebrate fossils of both Atlantic and Pacific affinity in La Cascada Formation. Connection would have occurred through narrow epicontinental seaways that formed channels in a dissected topography. The Antarctic Plate started to subduct beneath South America 14 million years ago in the Miocene, forming the Chile Triple Junction. At first, the Antarctic Plate subducted only in the southernmost tip of Patagonia, meaning that the Chile Triple Junction was located near the Strait of Magellan. As the southern part of the Nazca Plate and the Chile Rise became consumed by subduction, the more northerly regions of the Antarctic Plate began to subduct beneath Patagonia so that the Chile Triple Junction advanced to the north over time. The asthenospheric window associated to the triple junction disturbed previous patterns of mantle convection beneath Patagonia inducing an uplift of c. 1\u00a0km that reversed the Miocene transgression.\nPolitical divisions.\nAt a state level, Patagonia visually occupies an area within two countries: approximately 10% in Chile and approximately 90% in Argentina. Both countries have organized their Patagonian territories into nonequivalent administrative subdivisions: provinces and departments in Argentina, as well as regions, provinces, and communes in Chile. As Chile is a unitary state, its first-level administrative divisions\u2014the regions\u2014enjoy far less autonomy than analogous Argentine provinces. Argentine provinces have elected governors and legislatures, while Chilean regions had government-appointed intendants prior to the adoption of elected governors from 2021.\nThe Patagonian Provinces of Argentina are Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz, and Tierra del Fuego. The southernmost part of Buenos Aires Province can also be considered part of Patagonia.\nThe two Chilean regions undisputedly located entirely within Patagonia are Ays\u00e9n and Magallanes. Palena Province, a part of the Los Lagos Region, is also located within Patagonia. By some definitions, Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago, the rest of the Los Lagos Region, and part of the Los R\u00edos Region are also part of Patagonia.\nClimate.\nPatagonia's climate is mostly cool and dry year round. The east coast is warmer than the west, especially in summer, as a branch of the southern equatorial current reaches its shores, whereas the west coast is washed by a cold current. However, winters are colder on the inland plateaus east of the slopes and further down the coast on the southeast end of the Patagonian region. For example, at Puerto Montt, on the inlet behind Chilo\u00e9 Island, the mean annual temperature is and the average extremes are , whereas at Bah\u00eda Blanca near the Atlantic coast and just outside the northern confines of Patagonia, the annual temperature is and the range much greater, as temperatures above and below are recorded every year. At Punta Arenas, in the extreme south, the mean temperature is and the average extremes are . The prevailing winds are westerly, and the westward slope has a much heavier precipitation than the eastern in a rainshadow effect; the western islands close to Torres del Paine receive an annual precipitation of , while the eastern hills have less than and the plains have as little as of annual precipitation.\nPrecipitation is highly seasonal in northwestern Patagonia. For example, Villa La Angostura in Argentina, close to the border with Chile, receives up to of rain and snow in May, in June, and in July, compared to in February and in March. The total for the city is , making it one of the rainiest in Argentina. Farther west, some areas receive and more, especially on the Chilean side. In the northeast, the seasons for rain are reversed; most rain falls from occasional summer thunderstorms but totals barely reach in the northeast corner, and decrease rapidly to less than . The Patagonian west coast, which belongs exclusively to Chile, has a cool oceanic climate, with summer maximum temperatures ranging from in the south to in the north and nights between , and very high precipitation, from to more than in local microclimates. Snow is uncommon at the coast in the north but happens more often in the south, and frost is usually not very intense.\nImmediately east of the coast are the Andes, cut by deep fjords in the south and by deep lakes in the north, and with varying temperatures according to the altitude. The tree line ranges from close to on the northern side (except for the Andes in northern Neuqu\u00e9n in Argentina, where sunnier and dryer conditions allow trees to grow up to close to ), and diminishes southward to only in Tierra del Fuego. Precipitation changes dramatically from one spot to the other and diminishes very quickly eastward. An example of this is Laguna Fr\u00edas, in Argentina, which receives yearly. The city of Bariloche, about further east, receives about , and the airport, another east, receives less than . The easterly slopes of the Andes are home to several Argentine cities: San Mart\u00edn de los Andes, Bariloche, El Bols\u00f3n, Esquel, and El Calafate. Temperatures there are milder in the summer (in the north, between , with cold nights between ; in the south, summers are between , at night temperatures are similar to the north) and much colder in the winter, with frequent snowfall (although snow cover rarely lasts very long). Daytime highs range from in the north, and from in the south, whereas nights range from everywhere. Cold waves can bring much colder values; a temperature of has been recorded in Bariloche, and most places can often have temperatures between and highs staying around for a few days.\nDirectly east of these areas, the weather becomes much harsher; precipitation drops to between , the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao is a few hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) warmer, rising up to sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is , and some nights not uncommonly are 10\u00b0C (18\u00b0F) colder than in Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile. In 2017, temperatures even dropped down to in the region.\nThe northern Atlantic coast has warm summers (, but with relatively cool nights at ) and mild winters, with highs around and lows of about . Occasionally, temperatures have reached as low as and as high as , and rainfall is very scarce. The weather only gets a bit colder further south in Chubut, and the city of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of , nights of , and winters with days around and nights around , and less than of rain. However, a drastic drop occurs as one moves south to Santa Cruz; Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temperatures of with nights between and winter temperatures of with nights between , despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under and to remain below for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching occasionally.\nTierra del Fuego is extremely wet in the west, relatively damp in the south, and dry in the north and east. Summers are cool ( in the north, in the south, with nights generally between ), cloudy in the south, and very windy. Winters are dark and cold, but without the extreme temperatures in the south and west (Ushuaia rarely reaches , but hovers around for several months, and snow can be heavy). In the east and north, winters are much more severe, with cold snaps bringing temperatures down to all the way to the Rio Grande on the Atlantic coast. Snow can fall even in the summer in most areas, as well.\nFauna.\nThe guanaco (\"Lama guanicoe\"), South American cougar (\"Puma concolor concolor\"), the Patagonian fox (\"Lycalopex griseus\"), Patagonian hog-nosed skunk (\"Conepatus humboldtii\"), and Magellanic tuco-tuco (\"Ctenomys magellanicus\"; a subterranean rodent) are the most characteristic mammals of the Patagonian plains. The Patagonian steppe is one of the last strongholds of the guanaco and Darwin's rheas (\"Rhea pennata\"), which had been hunted for their skins by the Tehuelches, on foot using boleadoras, before the diffusion of firearms and horses; they were formerly the chief means of subsistence for the natives, who hunted them on horseback with dogs and bolas. Vizcachas (\"Lagidum\" spp.) and the Patagonian mara (\"Dolichotis patagonum\") are also characteristic of the steppe and the pampas to the north.\nThe fauna of Patagonia was heavily decimated by the end-Pleistocene extinction event around 12\u201310,000 years ago that resulted in the extinction of most large (megafaunal) animal species native to the region (as well as across the Americas). Species formerly present in the region include the large cow-sized ground sloth \"Mylodon\", the large camel-like ungulate \"Macrauchenia,\" indigenous equines belonging to the genus \"Hippidion,\" the giant short-faced bear \"Arctotherium,\" and the large sabertooth cat \"Smilodon\". The extinct fox \"Dusicyon avus\" (a close relative of the Falkland Islands wolf) also formerly inhabited the region, until apparently becoming extinct around 500\u2013400 years ago. Patagonia was inhabited by the jaguar subspecies \"Panthera onca mesembrina\", considerably larger than today's jaguars, during the Pleistocene, with jaguars continuing to inhabit Patagonia until the late 19th century, but now extirpated from the region.\nBird life is often abundant. The crested caracara (\"Caracara plancus\") is one of the characteristic aspects of a Patagonian landscape; the presence of austral parakeets (\"Enicognathus ferrugineus\") as far south as the shores of the strait attracted the attention of the earlier navigators, and green-backed firecrowns (\"Sephanoides sephaniodes\"), a species of hummingbird, may be seen flying amid the snowfall. One of the largest birds in the world, the Andean condor (\"Vultur gryphus\") can be seen in Patagonia. Of the many kinds of waterfowl the Chilean flamingo (\"Phoenicopterus chilensis\"), the upland goose (\"Chloephaga picta\"), and in the strait, the remarkable steamer ducks are found.\nSignature marine fauna include the southern right whale, the Magellanic penguin (\"Spheniscus magellanicus\"), the killer whale, and elephant seals. The Vald\u00e9s Peninsula is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, designated for its global significance as a site for the conservation of marine mammals.\nThe Patagonian freshwater fish fauna is relatively restricted compared to other similar Southern Hemisphere regions. The Argentine part is home to a total of 29 freshwater fish species, 18 of which are native. The introduced are several species of trout, common carp, and various species that originated in more northerly parts of South America. The natives are osmeriforms (\"Aplochiton\" and \"Galaxias\"), temperate perches (\"Percichthys\"), catfish (\"Diplomystes\", \"Hatcheria\" and \"Trichomycterus\"), Neotropical silversides (\"Odontesthes\") and characiforms (\"Astyanax\", \"Cheirodon\", \"Gymnocharacinus\", and \"Oligosarcus\"). Other Patagonian freshwater fauna include the highly unusual aeglid crustaceans.\nHistory.\nPre-Columbian Patagonia (10,000 BC \u2013 AD 1520).\nHuman habitation of the region dates back thousands of years, with some early archaeological findings in the area dated to at least the 13th millennium BC, although later dates around the 10th millennium BC are more securely recognized. Evidence exists of human activity at Monte Verde in Llanquihue Province, Chile, dated to around 14,500 years Before Present (~12,500 BC). The glacial-period ice fields and subsequent large meltwater streams would have made settlement difficult at that time.\nThe region seems to have been inhabited continuously since 10,000 BC by various cultures and alternating waves of migration, the details of which are as yet poorly understood. Several sites have been excavated, notably caves such as Cueva del Milodon in \u00daltima Esperanza in southern Patagonia, and Tres Arroyos on Tierra del Fuego, that support this date. Hearths, stone scrapers, and animal remains dated to 9400\u20139200 BC have been found east of the Andes.\nAt the close of the Pleistocene around 12\u201311,000 years ago (10,000-9,000 BC) Fishtail projectile points (a type of knapped stone spear point) were widespread across Patagonia (along with much of the rest of South America). At several sites these points have been found associated with extinct megafauna, including the large ground sloth \"Mylodon\" and the native equine \"Hippidion\".\nThe Cueva de las Manos is a famous site in Santa Cruz, Argentina. This cave at the foot of a cliff is covered in wall paintings, particularly the negative images of hundreds of hands, believed to date from around 8000 BC.\nBased on artifacts found in the region, apparently hunting of guanaco, and to a lesser extent rhea (\"\u00f1and\u00fa\"), were the primary food sources of tribes living on the eastern plains. It is also not clear if domestic dogs were part of early human activity. \"Bolas\" are commonly found and were used to catch guanaco and rhea. A maritime tradition existed along the Pacific coast, whose latest exponents were the Yaghan (Y\u00e1mana) to the south of Tierra del Fuego, the Kaweshqar between Taitao Peninsula and Tierra del Fuego, and the Chono people in the Chonos Archipelago. The Selk\u02bcnam, Haush, and Tehuelche are generally thought to be culturally and linguistically related peoples physically distinct from the sea-faring peoples.\nIt is possible that Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego was connected to the mainland in the Early Holocene (c. 9000 years BP) much in the same way that Riesco Island was back then. A Selk\u02bcnam tradition recorded by the Salesian missionary Giuseppe Mar\u00eda Beauvoir relate that the Selk\u02bcnam arrived in Tierra del Fuego by land, and that the Selk\u02bcnam were later unable to return north as the sea had flooded their crossing.\nAgriculture was practised in Pre-Hispanic Argentina as far south as southern Mendoza Province. Agriculture was at times practised beyond this limit in nearby areas of Patagonia but populations reverted at times to non-agricultural lifestyles. By the time of the Spanish arrival to the area (1550s) there is no record of agriculture being practised in northern Patagonia. The extensive Patagonian grasslands and an associated abundance of guanaco game may have contributed for the indigenous populations to favour a hunter-gathered lifestyle.\nThe indigenous peoples of the region included the Tehuelches, whose numbers and society were reduced to near extinction not long after the first contacts with Europeans. Tehuelches included the Gununa'kena to the north, Mecharnuekenk in south-central Patagonia, and the Aonikenk or Southern Tehuelche in the far south, north of the Magellan strait. On Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego, the Selk\u02bcnam (Ona) and Haush (Manek'enk) lived in the north and southeast, respectively. In the archipelagos to the south of Tierra del Fuego were Y\u00e1mana, with the Kaw\u00e9skar (Alakaluf) in the coastal areas and islands in western Tierra del Fuego and the southwest of the mainland. In the Patagonian archipelagoes north of Taitao Peninsula lived the Chonos. These groups were encountered in the first periods of European contact with different lifestyles, body decoration, and language, although it is unclear when this configuration emerged.\nTowards the end of the 16th century, Mapuche-speaking agriculturalists penetrated the western Andes and from there across into the eastern plains and down to the far south. Through confrontation and technological ability, they came to dominate the other peoples of the region in a short period of time, and are the principal indigenous community today.\nEarly European exploration (1520\u20131669).\nNavigators such as Gon\u00e7alo Coelho and Amerigo Vespucci possibly had reached the area (his own account of 1502 has it that they reached the latitude 52\u00b0S), but Vespucci's failure to accurately describe the main geographical features of the region such as the R\u00edo de la Plata casts doubts on whether they really did so.\nThe first or more detailed description of part of the coastline of Patagonia is possibly mentioned in a Portuguese voyage in 1511\u20131512, traditionally attributed to captain Diogo Ribeiro, who after his death was replaced by Estev\u00e3o de Frois, and was guided by the pilot and cosmographer Jo\u00e3o de Lisboa). The explorers, after reaching Rio de la Plata (which they would explore on the return voyage, contacting the Charr\u00faa and other peoples) eventually reached San Matias Gulf, at 42\u00b0S. The expedition reported that after going south of the 40th parallel, they found a \"land\" or a \"point extending into the sea\", and further south, a gulf. The expedition is said to have rounded the gulf for nearly and sighted the continent on the southern side of the gulf.\nThe Atlantic coast of Patagonia was first fully explored in 1520 by the Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan, who on his passage along the coast named many of its more striking features \u2013 San Mat\u00edas Gulf, Cape of 11,000 Virgins (now simply Cape Virgenes), and others. Magellan's fleet spent a difficult winter at what he named Puerto San Juli\u00e1n before resuming its voyage further south on 21 August 1520. During this time, it encountered the local inhabitants, likely to be Tehuelche people, described by his reporter, Antonio Pigafetta, as giants called Patagons.\nThe territory was claimed as part of the Governorate of New L\u00e9on, granted in 1534 to Governor Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor, part of the Governorates of the Spanish Empire of the Americas. The territory was redefined in 1534 and consisted of the southernmost part of the South American continent and the islands towards Antarctica.\nRodrigo de Isla, sent inland in 1535 from San Mat\u00edas by Sim\u00f3n de Alcazaba y Sotomayor (on whom Patagonia had been conferred by Charles I of Spain, is presumed to have been the first European to have traversed the great Patagonian plain. If the men under his charge had not mutinied, he might have crossed the Andes to reach the Pacific coast.\nPedro de Mendoza, on whom the country was next bestowed, founded Buenos Aires, but did not venture south. Francisco de Camargo (1536), Alonso de Camargo (1539), Juan Ladrilleros (1557), and Hurtado de Mendoza (1558) helped to make known the Pacific coasts, and while Sir Francis Drake's voyage in 1577 down the Atlantic coast, through the Strait of Magellan and northward along the Pacific coast, was memorable, yet the descriptions of the geography of Patagonia owe much more to the Spanish explorer Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa (1579\u20131580), who, devoting himself especially to the south-west region, made careful and accurate surveys. The settlements that he founded at Nombre de Jes\u00fas and San Felipe was neglected by the Spanish government, the latter being abandoned before Thomas Cavendish visited it in 1587 during his circumnavigation, and so desolate that he called it Port Famine. After the discovery of the route around Cape Horn, the Spanish Crown lost interest in southern Patagonia until the 18th century, when the coastal settlements Carmen de Patagones, San Jos\u00e9, Puerto Deseado, and Nueva Colonia Floridablanca were established, although it maintained its claim of a \"de jure\" sovereignty over the area.\nThe district around Puerto Deseado was explored and claimed in 1670 by Sir John Narborough for King Charles II of England, but the English made no attempt to establish settlements or explore the interior.\nPatagonian giants: early European perceptions.\nThe first European explorers of Patagonia observed that the indigenous people in the region were taller than the average Europeans of the time, prompting some of them to believe that Patagonians were giants.\nAccording to Antonio Pigafetta, one of the Magellan expedition's few survivors and its published chronicler, Magellan bestowed the name \"Patag\u00e3o\" (or \"Patag\u00f3n\") on the inhabitants they encountered there, and the name \"Patagonia\" for the region. Although Pigafetta's account does not describe how this name came about, subsequent popular interpretations gave credence to a derivation meaning \"land of the big feet\". However, this etymology is questionable. The term is most likely derived from an actual character name, \"Patag\u00f3n\", a savage creature confronted by Primale\u00f3n of Greece, the hero in the homonymous Spanish chivalry novel (or knight-errantry tale) by Francisco V\u00e1zquez. This book, published in 1512, was the sequel of the romance \"Palmer\u00edn de Oliva\";it was much in vogue at the time, and a favorite reading of Magellan. Magellan's perception of the natives, dressed in skins, and eating raw meat, clearly recalled the uncivilized Patag\u00f3n in V\u00e1zquez's book. Novelist and travel writer Bruce Chatwin suggests etymological roots of both Patagon and Patagonia in his book, \"In Patagonia\", noting the similarity between \"Patagon\" and the Greek word \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, which means \"a roaring\" or \"gnashing of teeth\" (in his chronicle, Pigafetta describes the Patagonians as \"roaring like bulls\").\nThe main interest in the region sparked by Pigafetta's account came from his reports of their meeting with the local inhabitants, whom they claimed to measure some 9 to 12 feet in height \u2013 \"so tall that we reached only to his waist\" \u2013 hence the later idea that Patagonia meant \"big feet\". This supposed race of Patagonian giants or Patagones entered into the common European perception of this then little-known and distant area, to be further fueled by subsequent reports of other expeditions and famous travelers such as Sir Francis Drake, which seemed to confirm these accounts. Early charts of the New World sometimes added the legend \"regio gigantum\" (\"region of the giants\") to the Patagonian area. By 1611, the Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of \"The Tempest\".\nThe concept and general belief persisted for a further 250 years and was to be sensationally reignited in 1767 when an \"official\" (but anonymous) account was published of Commodore John Byron's recent voyage of global circumnavigation in HMS \"Dolphin\". Byron and crew had spent some time along the coast, and the publication (\"Voyage Round the World in His Majesty's Ship the Dolphin\") seemed to give proof positive of their existence; the publication became an overnight bestseller, thousands of extra copies were to be sold to a willing public, and other prior accounts of the region were hastily republished (even those in which giant-like folk were not mentioned at all).\nHowever, the Patagonian giant frenzy died down substantially only a few years later, when some more sober and analytical accounts were published. In 1773, John Hawkesworth published on behalf of the Admiralty a compendium of noted English southern-hemisphere explorers' journals, including that of James Cook and John Byron. In this publication, drawn from their official logs, the people Byron's expedition had encountered clearly were no taller than , very tall but by no means giants. Interest soon subsided, although awareness of and belief in the concept persisted in some quarters even into the 20th century.\nSpanish outposts.\nThe failure of the Spanish colonization of the Strait of Magellan made the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago play an essential role as a Spanish base for protecting western Patagonia from the intrusion of other powers. Valdivia, reestablished in 1645, and Chilo\u00e9 acted as sentries, being hubs where the Spanish collected information and rumors from all over Patagonia.\nAs a result of the privateer and pirate menace, Spanish authorities ordered the depopulation of the Guaitecas Archipelago to deprive enemies of any eventual support from native populations. This then led to the transfer of the majority of the indigenous Chono population to the Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago in the north while some Chonos moved south of Taitao Peninsula effectively depopulating the territory in the 18th century.\nThe publication of Thomas Falkner's book \"A Description of Patagonia and the Adjacent Parts of South America\" in England fuelled speculations in Spain about renewed British interest in Patagonia. In response an order from the King of Spain was issued to settle the eastern coast of Patagonia. This led to the brief existence of colonies at the Gulf of San Jorge (1778\u20131779) and San Juli\u00e1n (1780\u20131783) and the more longlasting colony of Carmen de Patagones.\nScientific exploration (1764\u20131842).\nIn the second half of the 18th century, European knowledge of Patagonia was further augmented by the voyages of the previously mentioned John Byron (1764\u20131765), Samuel Wallis (1766, in the same HMS \"Dolphin\" which Byron had earlier sailed in) and Louis Antoine de Bougainville (1766). Thomas Falkner, a Jesuit who resided near forty years in those parts, published his \"Description of Patagonia\" (Hereford, 1774); Francisco Viedma founded \"El Carmen\", nowadays Carmen de Patagones and Antonio settled the area of San Julian Bay, where he founded the colony of Floridablanca and advanced inland to the Andes (1782). Basilio Villarino ascended the Rio Negro (1782).\nTwo hydrographic surveys of the coasts were of first-rate importance; the first expedition (1826\u20131830) included HMS \"Adventure\" and HMS \"Beagle\" under Phillip Parker King, and the second (1832\u20131836) was the voyage of the \"Beagle\" under Robert FitzRoy. The latter expedition is particularly noted for the participation of Charles Darwin, who spent considerable time investigating various areas of Patagonia onshore, including long rides with gauchos in R\u00edo Negro, and who joined FitzRoy in a expedition taking ships' boats up the course of the Santa Cruz River.\nSpanish American independence wars.\nDuring the independence wars, rumours about the imminent arrival of Spanish troops to Patagonia, either from Peru or Chilo\u00e9, were common among indigenous peoples of the Pampas and northern Patagonia. In 1820 Chilean patriot leader Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera allied with the indigenous Ranquel people of the Pampas to fight the rival patriots in Buenos Aires. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera ultimately planned to cross the Andes into Chile and oust his rivals in Chile.\nThe last royalist armed group in what is today Argentina and Chile, the Pincheira brothers, moved from the vicinities of Chill\u00e1n across the Andes into northern Patagonia as patriots consolidated control of Chile. The Pincheira brothers was an outlaw gang made of Europeans Spanish, American Spanish, Mestizos and local indigenous peoples. This group was able to move to Patagonia thanks to its alliance with two indigenous tribes, the Ranqueles and the Boroanos. In the interior of Patagonia, far from the de facto territory of Chile and the United Provinces, the Pincheira brothers established permanent encampment with thousands of settlers. From their bases the Pincheiras led numerous raids into the countryside of the newly established republics.\nChilean and Argentine colonization (1843\u20131902).\nIn the early 19th century, the araucanization of the natives of northern Patagonia intensified, and many Mapuches migrated to Patagonia to live as nomads that raised cattle or pillaged the Argentine countryside. The cattle stolen in the incursions (\"malones\") were later taken to Chile through the mountain passes and traded for goods, especially alcoholic beverages. The main trail for this trade was called Camino de los chilenos and runs a length around from the Buenos Aires Province to the mountain passes of Neuqu\u00e9n Province. The \"lonco\" Calfucur\u00e1 crossed the Andes from Chile to the pampas around 1830, after a call from the governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, to fight the Boroano people. In 1859, he attacked Bah\u00eda Blanca in Argentina with 3,000 warriors. As in the case of Calfucura, many other bands of Mapuches got involved in the internal conflicts of Argentina until Conquest of the Desert. To counter the cattle raids, a trench called the Zanja de Alsina was built by Argentina in the pampas in the 1870s.\nIn the mid-19th century, the newly independent nations of Argentina and Chile began an aggressive phase of expansion into the south, increasing confrontation with the Indigenous peoples of the region. In 1860, French adventurer Orelie-Antoine de Tounens proclaimed himself king of the Kingdom of Araucan\u00eda and Patagonia of the Mapuche.\nFollowing the last instructions of Bernardo O'Higgins, the Chilean president Manuel Bulnes sent an expedition to the Strait of Magellan and founded Fuerte Bulnes in 1843. Five years later, the Chilean government moved the main settlement to the current location of Punta Arenas, the oldest permanent settlement in Southern Patagonia. The creation of Punta Arenas was instrumental in making Chile's claim of the Strait of Magellan permanent. In the 1860s, sheep from the Falkland Islands were introduced to the lands around the Straits of Magellan, and throughout the 19th century, sheepfarming grew to be the most important economic sector in southern Patagonia.\nGeorge Chaworth Musters in 1869 wandered in company with a band of Tehuelches through the whole length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the northwest, and collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.\nConquest of the Desert and the 1881 treaty.\nArgentine authorities worried that the strong connections araucanized tribes had with Chile would allegedly give Chile certain influence over the pampas. Argentine authorities feared that in an eventual war with Chile over Patagonia, the natives would side with the Chileans and the war would be brought to the vicinity of Buenos Aires.\nThe decision to plan and execute the Conquest of the Desert was probably catalyzed by the 1872 attack of Cufulcur\u00e1 and his 6,000 followers on the cities of General Alvear, Veinticinco de Mayo, and Nueve de Julio, where 300 \"criollos\" were killed, and 200,000 heads of cattle taken. In the 1870s, the Conquest of the Desert was a controversial campaign by the Argentine government, executed mainly by General Julio Argentino Roca, to subdue or, some claim, to exterminate the native peoples of the south.\nIn 1885, a mining expeditionary party under the Romanian adventurer Julius Popper landed in southern Patagonia in search of gold, which they found after traveling southwards towards the lands of Tierra del Fuego. This led to the further opening up of the area to prospectors. European missionaries and settlers arrived throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, notably the Welsh settlement of the Chubut Valley. Numerous Croatians also settled in Patagonia.\nDuring the first years of the 20th century, the border between the two nations in Patagonia was established by the mediation of the British crown. Numerous modifications have been made since then, the last conflict having been resolved in 1994 by an arbitration tribunal constituted in Rio de Janeiro. It granted Argentina sovereignty over the Southern Patagonia Icefield, Cerro Fitz Roy, and Laguna del Desierto.\nUntil 1902, a large proportion of Patagonia's population were natives of Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago (Chilotes), who worked as peons in large livestock-farming \"estancias\". Because they were manual laborers, their social status was below that of the \"gauchos\" and the Argentine, Chilean, and European landowners and administrators.\nBefore and after 1902, when the boundaries were drawn, Argentina expelled many Chilotes from their territory, as they feared that having a large Chilean population in Argentina could pose a risk to their future control. These workers founded the first inland Chilean settlement in what is now the Ays\u00e9n Region; Balmaceda. Lacking good grasslands on the forest-covered Chilean side, the immigrants burned down the forest, setting fires that could last more than two years.\nEconomy.\nThe area's principal economic activities have been mining, whaling, livestock (notably sheep throughout) agriculture (wheat and fruit production near the Andes towards the north), and oil after its discovery near Comodoro Rivadavia in 1907.\nEnergy production is also a crucial part of the local economy. Railways were planned to cover continental Argentine Patagonia to serve the oil, mining, agricultural, and energy industries, and a line was built connecting San Carlos de Bariloche to Buenos Aires. Portions of other lines were built to the south, but the only lines still in use are La Trochita in Esquel, the Train of the End of the World in Ushuaia, both heritage lines,\nand a short run Tren Hist\u00f3rico de Bariloche to Perito Moreno.\nIn the western forest-covered Patagonian Andes and archipelagoes, wood logging has historically been an important part of the economy; it impelled the colonization of the areas of the Nahuel Huapi and L\u00e1car lakes in Argentina and Guaitecas Archipelago in Chile.\nLivestock.\nSheep farming introduced in the late 19th century has been a principal economic activity. After reaching its heights during the First World War, the decline in world wool prices affected sheep farming in Argentina. Nowadays, about half of Argentina's 15 million sheep are in Patagonia, a percentage that is growing as sheep farming disappears in the pampas to the north. Chubut (mainly Merino) is the top wool producer with Santa Cruz (Corriedale and some Merino) second. Sheep farming revived in 2002 with the devaluation of the peso and firmer global demand for wool (led by China and the EU). Still, little investment occurs in new abattoirs (mainly in Comodoro Rivadavia, Trelew, and Rio Gallegos), and often phytosanitary restrictions reduce the export of sheep meat. Extensive valleys in the Cordilleran Range have provided sufficient grazing lands, and the low humidity and weather of the southern region make raising Merino and Corriedale sheep common.\nLivestock also includes small numbers of cattle, and in lesser numbers, pigs and horses. Sheep farming provides a small but important number of jobs for rural areas with little other employment.\nTourism.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, tourism became an ever more important part of Patagonia's economy. Originally a remote backpacking destination, the region has attracted increasing numbers of upmarket visitors, cruise passengers rounding Cape Horn or visiting Antarctica, and adventure and activity holiday-makers. Principal tourist attractions include the Perito Moreno glacier, the Vald\u00e9s Peninsula, the Argentine Lake District and Ushuaia and Tierra del Fuego (the city is also a jumping-off place for travel to Antarctica, bringing in still more visitors). Tourism has created new markets locally and for export for traditional crafts such as Mapuche handicrafts, guanaco textiles, and confectionery and preserves.\nA spin-off from increased tourism has been the buying of often enormous tracts of land by foreigners, often as a prestige purchase rather than for agriculture. Buyers have included Sylvester Stallone, Ted Turner, and Christopher Lambert, and most notably Luciano Benetton, Patagonia's largest landowner. His \"Compa\u00f1ia de Tierras Sud\" has brought new techniques to the ailing sheep-rearing industry and sponsored museums and community facilities, but has been controversial particularly for its treatment of local Mapuche communities.\nEnergy.\nDue to its sparse rainfall in agricultural areas, Argentine Patagonia already has numerous dams for irrigation, some of which are also used for hydropower. The Limay River is used to generate hydroelectricity at five dams built on its course: Alicur\u00e1, Piedra del \u00c1guila, Pichi Pic\u00fan Leuf\u00fa, El Choc\u00f3n, and Arroyito. Together with the Cerros Colorados Complex on the Neuqu\u00e9n River, they contribute more than one-quarter of the total hydroelectric generation in the country.\nPatagonia has always been Argentina's main area, and Chile's only area, of conventional oil and gas production. Oil and gas have played an important role in the rise of Neuqu\u00e9n-Cipolleti as Patagonia's most populous urban area, and in the growth of Comodoro Rivadavia, Punta Arenas, and Rio Grande, as well. The development of the Neuqu\u00e9n basin's enormous unconventional oil and gas reserves through hydraulic fracturing has just begun, but the YPF-Chevron Loma Campana field in the Vaca Muerta formation is already the world's largest producing shale oil field outside North America according to former YPF CEO Miguel Gallucio.\nPatagonia's notorious winds have already made the area Argentina's main source of wind power, and plans have been made for major increases in wind power generation. Coal is mined in the Rio Turbio area and used for electricity generation.\nCuisine.\nArgentine Patagonian cuisine is largely the same as the cuisine of Buenos Aires \u2013 grilled meats and pasta \u2013 with extensive use of local ingredients and less use of those products that have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game meats, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and \"centolla\" (king crab) are also common, though overfishing of \"centolla\" has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, a noted Alpine cuisine tradition remains, with chocolate bars and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin, as well as in the mountains. Since the mid-1990s, some success with winemaking has occurred in Argentine Patagonia, especially in Neuqu\u00e9n.\nForeign land buyers issue.\nForeign investors, including Italian multinational Benetton Group, media magnate Ted Turner, British billionaire Joe Lewis and the conservationist Douglas Tompkins, own major land areas. This situation has caused several conflicts with local inhabitants and the governments of Chile and Argentina, for example, the opposition by Douglas Tompkins to the planned route for Carretera Austral in Pumal\u00edn Park.

{"id": "65434", "revid": "30699314", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65434", "title": "Sin City", "text": "Comic books series by Frank Miller\nSin City is a series of neo-noir comics by American comic book writer-artist Frank Miller. The first story originally appeared in \"Dark Horse Presents Fifth Anniversary Special\" (April 1991), and continued in \"Dark Horse Presents\" 51\u201362 from May 1991 to June 1992, under the title of \"Sin City\", serialized in thirteen parts. Several other stories of variable lengths have followed. The intertwining stories, with frequently recurring characters, take place in Basin City.\nA film adaptation of \"Sin City\", co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Miller, was released on April 1, 2005. A sequel, \"\", was released on August 22, 2014.\nPublication history.\nWriter-artist Frank Miller rose to fame within the American comics industry with his 1981\u20131983 work on Marvel Comics' \"Daredevil\", and the 1986 DC Comics miniseries \"The Dark Knight Returns\", both of which exhibited subtle elements of film noir. Miller's venture into the film noir genre deepened with his creator-owned series \"Sin City\", which began publishing in serialized form in the Dark Horse Comics anthology series \"Dark Horse Presents\" #51\u201362. The story was released in a trade paperback and later re-released in 1995 under the name \"\".\nIn a 2016 interview with the Kubert School, Miller explained his inspiration for \"Sin City\" thus:\nI've been a fanatic for a long time for old crime movies and old crime novels. But it started with the movies. And the old Cagney movies. Bogart and all that. I loved just how the morals of the stories are. They're all about right and wrong. But in \"Sin City\" in particular I wanted them all to happen to in a world where virtuous behavior was rare, which greatly resembled the world I lived in. It's kinda like the old Rolling Stones song, where every cop's a criminal, and all the sinners are saints, where the lowlifes would often be heroic, and the most stridently beautiful and sweet women would be prostitutes. I wanted it to be a world out of balance, where virtue is defined by individuals in difficult situations, not by an overwhelming sense of goodness that was somehow governed by this godlike Comics Code.\nThe film noir influence on the series' artwork is seen in its use of shadow and stark backgrounds. Black and white are the sole colors most of the time, with exception of red, yellow, blue, and pink, of which limited use is made in some stories to draw attention to particular characters.\nThe writing style also draws heavily on detective and crime pulp fiction.\nMiller's \"Sin City\" work challenges some conventions of comic book form. The letters of onomatopoeic words like \"blam\" are often incorporated into scenes via lighting effects, or are suggested by the negative space between panels, or are created by the outline of the panels themselves. This is especially evident in early \"yarns,\" such as \"The Hard Goodbye\", which were more experimental.\nOn April 28, 2022, it was officially announced that Miller was launching the comic book publishing company Frank Miller Presents (FMP), with one of his initial contributions being a Western tale set in Sin City's past, titled \"Sin City 1858\".\nSetting.\nBasin City, almost universally referred to by the nickname \"Sin City\", is a fictional town in the Western United States. The climate is hot and arid, although Sacred Oaks is characterized as being heavily wooded. A major river runs through the city, which has an extensive waterfront. Usually twice a year, a major downpour comes, and the city is prone to heavy snowfall in the winter. Desert lizards and palm trees are common, while tar pits, desert areas, mountain ranges and flat farmland make up the landscape around the city.\nThe Basin City Police Department are more or less along the lines of paramilitary or SWAT, as they have to deal with incredibly high crime rates among criminals and civilians alike, which is why they have access to what most would consider \"heavy weaponry\" and full body armor. Those who make up the force have been described as commonly being lazy, cowardly and/or corrupt. Only a handful of the cops are honest, though frequently the wealthy of the city bribe the corrupt members of the police into performing their duty (usually as a result of some crime being committed or threatened against a member of their family).\nDuring the California Gold Rush, the Roark family \"imported\" a large number of attractive women to keep the miners happy, making a fortune and turning a struggling mining camp into a thriving, bustling city. Over the years, as the Roark family migrated into other areas of business and power, these women ended up forming the district of Old Town, the prostitute quarter of the city where they rule with absolute authority. In addition, the people charged with governing the city, most of them from the Roark line, remained in power for generations, running it as they saw fit.\nAs the various yarns progress, the audience gradually becomes familiar with key locations in and around Basin City:\nCharacters.\nOrganizations.\nBecause a large majority of the residents of Basin City are criminals, there are several organizations and cartels central to the stories who are vying for monopoly over the various criminal enterprises in the city. Listed below are crime syndicates, gangs and other low-lifes who figure heavily in the Sin City mythos.\nThe Basin City Police Department: So deep does corruption and criminality run in Basin City that even their police officers qualify as a gang of paid thugs, turning a blind eye to the affairs of those too poor to pay them off. Few among them are considered incorruptible; even the honest officers are unable (or unwilling) to curtail the criminal actions of the dishonest ones. Notable characters in the series who are police include Detective John Hartigan, his partner Bob, Lieutenants Jack Rafferty and Mort, Commissioner Liebowitz, and Officers Manson and Bundy from \"Hell and Back\".\nRoark family: A dynasty of corrupt landowners and politicians whose influence over Basin City has stretched as far back as the days of the Old West. Famous Roarks of this generation include a senator, a cardinal, an attorney general, and Roark Junior, 'That Yellow Bastard'.\nThe Girls of Old Town: Populating the region of Basin City known as Old Town is a group of women in the world's oldest profession, having made a truce with the cops to allow them to govern and police themselves. As of \"A Dame to Kill For\", they were led by the twins, Goldie and Wendy.\nWallenquist Organization: A powerful crime syndicate led by Herr Wallenquist, a mysterious crime lord with a broad range of criminal enterprises to his name. Although they are one of the city's two \"normal\" criminal organizations, the Wallenquist management seems to be the most peaceful and forgiving of the various leaders. It is unknown which crime rings they hold.\nMagliozzi Crime Family: The undisputed heads of the local Cosa Nostra, the Magliozzi family seems to be the purest example of \"true\" Mafia lifestyle. While they appear in only one story, it is hinted that the Mafia influence in Basin City's underworld is a lot larger than just their family and that there are more families.\nOther groups that have been seen or mentioned in the comics include:\nTong gangsters: Mentioned, but not seen as of \"A Dame to Kill For\". Miho's life was saved by Dwight when he secretly protected her during a fight with several Tong gangsters in a dark alleyway.\nWhite slavers: Mentioned, but not seen as of \"A Dame to Kill For\". Led by a man named Manuel, whose brothers were also involved. Were \"taken care of\" by Dwight prior to the events of \"A Dame to Kill For\".\nIrish mercenaries: Seen during \"The Big Fat Kill\", most of them are evidently former IRA members, as implied by one of the mercenaries referring to his glee at blowing up a public house (British pubs were targeted by the IRA). All are killed by Dwight and Miho.\n\"Sin City\" yarns.\nThese are the individual stories, usually referred to as \"yarns,\" set in Frank Miller's Sin City universe.\nCollected editions.\nThe stories have been collected into a number of trade paperbacks and hardcover editions. There is also a collection of art, \"The Art of Sin City\".\nIn 2016, Dark Horse Comics released an ambitious, oversized edition titled \"Frank Miller\u2019s Sin City The Hard Goodbye Curator\u2019s Collection\". This 15 x 21 inch book reprints the entire first storyline, scanned and reproduced exactly from the original art at 1:1 size. When referencing the production process in an interview with Michael Dooley for Print Magazine, editor/designer John Lind gave the anecdote \u201cWhen Frank and I first reviewed some of the scanned pages from \"Sin City\", he pulled one aside and said, \u2018You can see details in some of the scans where you can tell what the humidity was like when I was lettering because you can see the smudging from my hand.\u2019 That type of reaction represents the level of detail I'm working hard to achieve with the production.\nAdaptations.\nFilms.\nA film adaptation of \"Sin City\", co-directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, was released on April 1, 2005. A sequel, \"\", was released on August 22, 2014.\nTelevision.\nDimension Films planned to develop a soft reboot of the series for television; Stephen L\u2019Heureux who produced the second film was to oversee the series with \"Sin City\" creator Frank Miller. The new TV series would feature new characters and timelines and be more like the comics rather than the films. On November 15, 2019, Legendary Pictures bought the rights for the television series.\nReception.\nLarry Snelly reviewed \"Sin City\" in \"White Wolf Inphobia\" #53 (March, 1995) and stated that \"\"Sin City\" [...] scratches below the surface to reveal important issues [...] It makes you wonder if we've created our own 'sin cities' as we, as a society, value beauty over integrity.\"\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

Romero\nDawn of the Dead\u200a is a 1978 zombie horror film written, directed, and edited by George A. Romero, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein. An American-Italian international co-production, it is the second film in Romero's series of zombie films, and though it contains no characters or settings from the preceding film \"Night of the Living Dead\" (1968), it shows the larger-scale effects of a zombie apocalypse on society. In the film, a phenomenon of unidentified origin has caused the reanimation of the dead, who prey on human flesh. David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross star as survivors of the outbreak who barricade themselves inside a suburban shopping mall during mass hysteria.\nRomero waited to make another zombie film after \"Night of the Living Dead\" for several years to avoid being stereotyped as a horror director. Upon visiting Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania with a friend whose company managed the complex, he decided to use the location as the basis for the film's story. The project came to the attention of Italian filmmaker Dario Argento who, along with his brother Claudio and producer Alfredo Cuomo, agreed to co-finance the film in exchange for its international distribution rights. Argento also consulted with Romero during the scriptwriting phase. Principal photography on \"Dawn of the Dead\" took place between November 1977 and February 1978 on location in Monroeville and Pittsburgh. The special make-up effects were created by Tom Savini, whose work on the film led to an extensive career creating similar effects for other horror films. In post-production, Romero and Argento edited separate versions of the film for their respective markets. Argento's version features a progressive rock score composed and performed by his frequent collaborators Goblin, while Romero's cut primarily favors stock cues from the De Wolfe Music Library.\nFollowing its Italian premiere on September 1, 1978, \"Dawn of the Dead\" was released in other markets the following year. Despite facing difficulties with various national censorship boards \u2013 in the United States, it was released unrated to improve its commercial prospects after it was given an X by the Motion Picture Association of America, and in Britain it was liable for seizure during the 1980s \"video nasties\" moral panic \u2013 the film proved to be a major success at the box office, grossing $66 million worldwide against its estimated budget of $640,000. Noted for its satirical portrayal of consumerism, \"Dawn of the Dead\" has received widespread critical acclaim since its initial release, and is widely considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, as well as the greatest zombie film. Like its predecessor, it has garnered a large, international cult following. In 2008, it was chosen by \"Empire\" magazine as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\", along with \"Night of the Living Dead\".\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" was followed by four official sequels, beginning with 1985's \"Day of the Dead\", and a separate series of unofficial Italian-made sequels, beginning with 1979's \"Zombi 2.\" It has also inspired a 2004 remake film directed by Zack Snyder, as well as numerous parodies and pop culture references in other media such as \"Shaun of the Dead\", \"Dead Rising\", and \"Left 4 Dead\".\nPlot.\nThe United States is devastated by a mysterious plague that reanimates recently-dead human beings as flesh-eating zombies. At the dawn of the crisis, it has been reported that millions of people have died and reanimated. Despite the government's best efforts, social order is collapsing. While rural communities have natural barriers, such as Johnstown, and the National Guard have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, urban centers have descended into chaos.\nAt WGON-TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station's helicopter to escape the city. Across town, Philadelphia Police Department SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income housing project, whose mostly black and Latino tenants are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The tenants and the officers exchange gunfire as the officers try to gain entry, and indiscriminate attacks by racist officers and the reanimated dead exacerbate the resulting chaos. Roger encounters an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team successfully dispatch the zombies, a disillusioned Roger suggests that he and Peter desert and join up with Stephen (who is Roger's friend) in escaping the city.\nRoger and Peter join Fran and Stephen at a police dock and then leave Philadelphia in a stolen WGON-TV news helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, and decide to remain there since there is plenty of food, medicine, and all kinds of consumables. Roger, Peter and Stephen camouflage the entrance to the stairwell leading to their safe room and block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. This involves driving through crowds of zombies, who attack the trucks. Roger becomes reckless and is soon bitten by the zombies.\nAfter clearing the mall of zombies, the group builds a hidden safe room as a fallback in case of future attacks, before settling into a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; when he reanimates, Peter shoots him in the head and buries his body in the mall. Months later, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed. Now isolated, the three load some supplies into the helicopter, in case they might need to leave suddenly. Fran gets Stephen to teach her how to fly in case he is killed or incapacitated.\nA nomadic biker gang sees the helicopter in flight and breaks into the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back inside. Despite having a fallback plan should the mall be attacked, Stephen, consumed by territorial rage, takes matters into his own hands by firing on the looters, beginning a protracted battle. On their way out, straggling bikers are overwhelmed and eaten by the zombies. Stephen tries to hide in the elevator shaft, but gets shot and subsequently mauled by roaming zombies. When Stephen reanimates, he instinctively returns to the safe room and leads the undead to Fran and Peter. Peter kills the undead Stephen while Fran escapes to the roof. Peter, not wanting to leave, locks himself in a room and contemplates suicide. When the zombies burst in, he has a change of heart and fights his way up to the roof, where he joins Fran. Having escaped and low on fuel, the two then fly away in the helicopter to an uncertain future.\nCast.\nDirector George A. Romero makes an uncredited appearance as a WGON TV director. Assistant director and Romero's future-wife\u2014Christine Forrest\u2014portrays his assistant. Also featured at the WGON TV station are David Crawford as Dr. James Foster, David Early as commentator Sidney Berman and Daniel Dietrich as station manager Dan Givens. Future \"Romper Room\" hostess Molly McClosky makes an uncredited appearance as a station worker. Later sequences depicting an emergency TV network feature Howard Smith as an unnamed commentator and recurring Romero collaborator Richard France as Dr. Millard Rausch, referred to in the credits as \"Scientist\".\nFeatured among the motorcycle raiders are Rudy Ricci as their leader, brothers and frequent Romero collaborators Tony and Pasquale Buba, and Taso N. Stavrakis. Tom Savini, the film's make-up artist, also appears as Blades, a machete-wielding raider. Joseph Pilato, who would later be cast in Romero's \"Day of the Dead\", plays the leader of group of police officers evacuating by boat, although most of his performance was cut from the theatrical release. Other police officers in the film include James A. Baffico as Wooley, with his wife Joey Baffico having an uncredited role as a zombie who attacks Roger. Longtime Romero collaborator John Amplas, who also served as the film's casting director, makes an uncredited appearance as one of the apartment tenants who engages in a gunfight with the police.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nThe history of \"Dawn of the Dead\" began in 1974, when George A. Romero was invited by friend Mark Mason of Oxford Development Company\u2014whom Romero knew from an acquaintance at his alma mater, Carnegie Mellon\u2014to visit the Monroeville Mall, which Mason's company managed. After showing Romero hidden parts of the mall, during which Romero noted the bliss of the consumers, Mason jokingly suggested that someone would be able to survive in the mall, should an emergency ever occur. With this inspiration, Romero began to write the screenplay for the film.\nRomero and his producer, Richard P. Rubinstein, were unable to procure any domestic investors for the new project. By chance, word of the sequel reached Italian horror director Dario Argento. A fan of \"Night of the Living Dead\" and an early critical proponent of the film, Argento was eager to help the horror classic receive a sequel. He met Romero and Rubinstein, helping to secure financing in exchange for international distribution rights. Argento invited Romero to Rome so he would have a change of scenery while writing the screenplay. The two could also discuss plot developments. Romero was able to secure the availability of the Monroeville Mall as well as additional financing through his connections with the mall's owners at Oxford Development. Once the casting was completed, principal shooting was scheduled to begin in Pennsylvania on November 13, 1977.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography for \"Dawn of the Living Dead\" (its working title at the time) began on November 13, 1977, at the Monroeville Mall in Monroeville, Pennsylvania. Use of an actual, open shopping mall during the Christmas shopping season caused numerous time constraints. Filming began nightly once the mall closed, starting at 11PM and ending at7 AM, when automated music came on. As December arrived, the production decided against having the crew remove and replace the Christmas decorations\u2014a task that had proved to be too time-consuming. Filming was shut down during the last three weeks of the year to avoid the possible continuity difficulties and lost shooting time. Production would resume on January 3, 1978. During the break in filming, Romero took the opportunity to begin editing his existing footage.\nThe airfield scenes were filmed at the Harold W. Brown Memorial Airfield in Monroeville, an airport located about two miles from the mall that is still in use. The scenes of the group's hideout at the top of the mall were filmed on a set built at Romero's then-production company, The Latent Image. The elevator shaft was located there as well, as no such area of the mall actually existed. The gun store was also not located in the mall\u2014for filming, the crew used Firearms Unlimited, a shop that existed in the East Liberty district of Pittsburgh at the time. The police dock scene was filmed in downtown Pittsburgh right next the Monongahela River at 1 S. 6th St. The building, landing pad, and pumps are long gone, and the location is now an outdoor art gallery called The Color Park. The truck yard scene was filmed at the B&amp;P Motor Express Co. which is now a First Student school bus company in Irwin, PA, about 22 minutes from the Monroeville Mall.\nPrincipal photography on \"Dawn of the Dead\" ended in February 1978, and Romero's process of editing would begin. By using numerous angles during the filming, Romero allowed himself an array of possibilities during editing\u2014choosing from these many shots to reassemble into a sequence that could dictate any number of responses from the viewer simply by changing an angle or deleting or extending portions of scenes. This amount of superfluous footage is evidenced by the numerous international cuts, which in some cases affects the regional version's tone and flow.\nAlternative ending.\nAccording to the original screenplay, Peter and Francine were to kill themselves, Peter by shooting himself and Fran by sticking her head into the path of the rotating main helicopter blades. The ending credits would run over a shot of the helicopter blades turning until the engine winds down, implying that the two would not have gotten far if they had chosen to escape. During production, it was decided to change the ending of the film.\nMuch of the lead-in to the two suicides remains in the film, as Francine leans out of the helicopter upon seeing the zombies approach, and Peter puts a gun to his head, ready to shoot himself. An additional scene, showing a zombie having the top of its head cut off by the helicopter blades (thus foreshadowing Francine's suicide) was included early in the film. Romero has stated that the original ending was scrapped before being shot, although behind-the-scenes photos show the original version was at least tested. The head appliance made for Francine's suicide was instead used in the opening SWAT raid, made-up to resemble an African American male and blown apart by a shotgun blast.\nMake-up and effects.\n Tom Savini, who had been offered the chance to provide special effects and make-up for Romero's first zombie film, \"Night of the Living Dead,\" before being drafted into the Vietnam War, made his debut as an effects artist on \"Dawn of the Dead\". Savini had been known for his make-up in horror for some time, prior to \"Dawn of the Dead\", and in his book explaining special effects techniques, \"Bizarro\", explains how his time in Vietnam influenced his craft. He had a crew of eight to assist in applying gray makeup to two to three hundred extras each weekend during the shoot. One of his assistants during production was Joseph Pilato, who played a police captain in the film and would go on to play the lead villain in the film's sequel, \"Day of the Dead\", Captain Henry Rhodes.\nThe makeup for the multitudes of extras in the film was a basic blue or gray tinge to the face of each extra. Some featured zombies, who would be seen close-up or on-screen longer than others, had more time spent on their look. Many of the featured zombies became part of the fanfare, with nicknames based upon their look or activity\u2014such as Machete Zombie, Sweater Zombie, and Nurse Zombie. \"Sweater Zombie\" Clayton Hill was described by a crew member as \"one of the most convincing zombies of the bunch\" citing his skill at maintaining his stiff pose and rolling his eyes back into his head, including heading down the wrong way in an escalator while in character.\nA cast of Ross' head that was to be used in the original ending of the film (involving a suicide rather than the escape scene finally used) ended up as an exploding head during the tenement building scene. The head, filled with food scraps, was shot with an actual shotgun to get the head to explode. One of the unintentional standout effects was the bright, fluorescent color of the fake blood that was used in the film. Savini was an early opponent of the blood, produced by 3M, but Romero thought it added to the film, claiming it emphasised the comic book feel of the movie.\nSavini rented a skeleton from Larry Wintersteller, who acquired it in the early 1970s and knew that it was a real skeleton. Wintersteller sold the skeleton to Marilynn Wick, who was unaware that it was real. The skeleton was on display at a costume shop in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, before County Coroner Joshua Perper confiscated it in 1982. Fake flesh from the skeleton's use in \"Dawn of the Dead\" was still on the skeleton when Perper confiscated it. The skeleton was buried on March 19, 1983, and was reported to have belong to a woman who died 100 years before at age 35.\nMusic.\nThe film's music varies with Romero's and Argento's cuts. For Romero's theatrical version, musical cues and selections were chosen from the De Wolfe Music Library, a compilation of stock music scores and cues. In the montage scene featuring the hunters and National Guard, the song played in the background is \"'Cause I'm a Man\" by the Pretty Things. The song was first released on the group's LP \"Electric Banana\". The music heard playing in a sequence in the mall and over the film's end credits is an instrumental titled \"The Gonk\"\u2014a polka style tune from the De Wolfe Music Library written by Herbert Chappell, with a chorus of zombie moans added by Romero.\nFor Argento's international cut, the Italian director used the band Goblin (incorrectly credited as \"The Goblins\") extensively. Goblin is a four-piece Italian progressive rock band that mostly provides contract work for film soundtracks. Argento, who received a credit for original music alongside Goblin, collaborated with the group to get music for his cut of the film. Romero used three of their pieces in his theatrical release version. The Goblin score would later find its way onto a \"Dawn of the Dead\"-inspired film, \"Hell of the Living Dead\". Many tracks would also appear in the Tsui Hark film \"Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind\". The version of \"Dawn\" released on video in the mid-nineties under the label \"Director's Cut\" does not use most of the Goblin tracks, as they had not been completed at the time of that edit.\nPost-production.\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" has received a number of re-cuts and re-edits, due mostly to Argento's rights to edit the film for international foreign language release. Romero controlled the final cut of the film for English-language territories. In addition, the film was edited further by censors or distributors in certain countries. Romero, acting as the editor for his film, completed a hasty 139-minute version of the film (now known as the Extended, or previously erroneously as Director's Cut) for premiere at the 1978 Cannes Film Market. This was later pared down to 126 minutes for the US theatrical release. The US theatrical cut of the film earned the taboo rating of X because of its graphic violence. Rejecting this rating, Romero and the producers chose to release the film unrated to help the film's commercial success. United Film Distribution Company eventually agreed to release it domestically in the United States. The film was refused classification in Australia twice: in its theatrical release in 1978 and once again in 1979. The cuts presented to the Australian Classification Board were Argento's cut and Romero's cut, respectively. \"Dawn of the Dead\" was finally released there by United Artists, with an R18+ rating following six minutes worth of cuts compared to Romero's US version, in February 1980.\nInternationally, Argento controlled the Euro cut for non-English speaking countries. The version he created clocked in at 119 minutes. It included changes such as more music from Goblin than the cuts completed by Romero, removal of some expository scenes, and a faster cutting pace. There are, however, extra lines of dialogue and gore shots that are not in either of Romero's edits. It actually debuted nearly nine months before the US theatrical cut. \"Dawn of the Dead\" was released under different names in Europe: in Italy as , followed in March 1979 in France as , in Spain as , in the Netherlands as , in Germany by Constantin Film as , and in Denmark as .\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" was successful internationally. Its success in then-West Germany earned it the Golden Screen Award, given to films that have at least three million admissions within 18 months of release. A majority of these versions were released on DVD in the 2004 Special Edition, and have previously been released on VHS. The freelance photographer Richard Burke, working for \"Pittsburgh Magazine\", released in May 2010 the first exclusive behind-the-scenes photos from the set.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\nOn September 1, 1978, a 119-minute cut of the film created for non-English speaking countries premiered in Turin, Italy under the title \"Zombi\", with Dario Argento in attendance. The same cut would open in Japan the weekend on March 27, 1979, and immediately top its box office there. A 126-minute cut for English-language speaking territories premiered in the United States on April 7, 1979, at the USA Film Festival in Dallas, Texas, having been selected for the event by film critic Roger Ebert. The following weekend, United Film Distribution opened the same cut in seventeen Pittsburgh cinemas, and continued with a wider rollout over the next month. The picture opened in New York City on April 20, and in Los Angeles on May 11.\nHome media.\nIn 2004, after numerous VHS, Laserdisc and DVD releases of several different versions of the film from various companies, Anchor Bay Entertainment released a definitive \"Ultimate Edition\" DVD box set of \"Dawn of the Dead\", following a single-disc U.S. theatrical cut released earlier in the year. The set features all three widely available versions of the film, along with different commentary tracks for each version, documentaries and extras. Also re-released with the DVD set was Roy Frumkes' \"Document of the Dead\", which chronicled the making of \"Dawn of the Dead\" and Romero's career to that point. The \"Ultimate Edition\" earned a Saturn Award for Best Classic Film Release.\nThe U.S. theatrical cut of \"Dawn of the Dead\" was released on Blu-ray by Anchor Bay on October 7, 2007, in the U.S. It was released on Blu-ray in the United Kingdom by Arrow Video, which includes the theatrical cut and two DVDs with the Cannes and Argento cut. An Australian Blu-ray was released by Umbrella Entertainment. Reportedly, the film went out of print on home media as a result of Rubinstein significantly increasing its home media licensing fees. Some speculate that this was due to a desire to recoup the $6 million he spent producing a 3D conversion of the film.\nIn November 2016, Koch Media, under their Midnight Factory line, released a six-disc Collector's Edition Blu-ray package for the Italian market. This release includes the Argento cut in 4K Ultra HD format, as well as both the original 1.85:1 theatrical framing and 1.33:1 of the Argento cut, as well as the original theatrical cut and the extended Cannes cut of the film in high definition Blu-ray format. Koch also released a four-disc set, omitting the UHD and 1.33:1 discs, and a single Blu-ray of the European cut.\nIn 2018, XT Video released the complete version of the film for Blu-ray, which is a fusion of the long and Italian versions of the film, plus cut scenes.\nIn November 2020, British home media distributor Second Sight Films released a limited edition box set of the film in separate Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray formats, featuring the theatrical, Cannes and Argento cuts of the film. For this release, all three cuts were remastered and restored in 4K resolution, with the theatrical and Cannes versions presented on the 4K Blu-ray sets in HDR10+. The theatrical and Cannes cuts were restored from the original camera negative by Second Sight at Final Frame New York and London under the supervision and approval of Michael Gornick, the film's cinematographer. The audio, presented in Mono (with additional Stereo and 5.1 Surround tracks for the theatrical cut), was restored from the negative's optical soundtrack. Scenes exclusive to the Cannes version were restored using that version's color reversal internegative, while the Argento version, presented in SDR, was restored from its interpositive, and similarly features Mono, Stereo and 5.1 Surround audio tracks. The box set also contains a Blu-ray disc with a collection of original and archival bonus features; three CDs featuring Goblin's original soundtrack and a compilation of the De Wolfe Music cues featured in the theatrical and Cannes cuts; \"Dawn of the Dead: Dissecting the Dead\", a hardcover book containing essays, artwork and other archival features; and a paperback copy of the film's novelisation.\n3D re-release.\nWork on a 3D conversion of the film was begun in 2007 under the supervision of Rubinstein. It was completed in 2013 at a reported cost of $6 million. The 3D version had its world premiere in October 2013 at the Busan International Film Festival. In October 2022, it finally received a wider release, exclusively in 250 Regal Cinemas theaters. It was screened again at five North American theaters as part of a 45th anniversary re-release of the film in 2024.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Dawn of the Dead\" performed well thanks both to commercial advertising and word-of-mouth. Ad campaigns and posters declared the film \"the most intensely shocking motion picture experience for all times\". The film earned $900,000 on its opening weekend in the United States. After four weeks it had grossed $ in the United States and Canada, and went on to gross $16 million with rentals of $6.8 million.\nInternationally it did well too, grossing $1.5 million in six Japanese cinemas over a period of 42 days and over $1 million in Italy, and by October 1979 it had grossed $24 million worldwide. \"The Numbers\" claims it had an international gross of $49.9 million, which with a domestic gross of $16 million, gives a worldwide total of $66 million, making it the most profitable film in the \"Dead\" series.\nCritical reception.\nRotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 92% of 59 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review. The average rating is 8.70/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \"One of the most compelling and entertaining zombie films ever, \"Dawn of the Dead\" perfectly blends pure horror and gore with social commentary on material society.\" Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it four out of four stars and proclaimed it \"one of the best horror films ever made.\" While conceding \"Dawn of the Dead\" to be \"gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling,\" Ebert said that \"nobody ever said art had to be in good taste.\" Steve Biodrowski of \"Cinefantastique\" praised the film, calling it a \"broader\" version of \"Night of the Living Dead\", and gave particular credit to the acting and themes explored: \"the acting performances are uniformly strong; and the script develops its themes more explicitly, with obvious satirical jabs at modern consumer society, as epitomized by the indoor shopping mall where a small band of human survivors take shelter from the zombie plague sweeping the country.\" He went on to say that \"Dawn of the Dead\" was a \"savage (if tongue-in-cheek) attack on the foibles of modern society\", showcasing explicit gore and horror and turning them into \"a form of art\". Gene Siskel liked the movie as well, giving it 3 stars in his Chicago Tribune print review and specifically praising George Romero's satirical view of indoor shopping malls relative to a zombie apocalypse.\nSimilar to the preceding \"Night of the Living Dead\", some critical reviewers did not like the gory special effects. Particularly displeased at the large amount of gore and graphic violence was \"The New York Times\" critic Janet Maslin, who claimed she walked out after the first fifteen minutes due to \"a pet peeve about flesh-eating zombies who never stop snacking,\" and Gene Shalit of NBC's \"Today\" show dismissed it as \"Yawn of the Living.\" Others, particularly \"Variety\", attacked the film's writing, suggesting that the violence and gore detract from any development of the characters, making them \"uninteresting\", resulting in a loss of impact. \"Variety\" wrote: \"\"Dawn\" pummels the viewer with a series of ever-more-grisly events \u2014 shootings, knifings, flesh tearings \u2014 that make Romero's special effects man, Tom Savini, the real \"star\" of the film\u2014the actors are as woodenly uninteresting as the characters they play.\" Pauline Kael wrote that, in contrast to the \"truly frightening\" \"Night of the Living Dead\", \"you begin to laugh with relief that you're not being emotionally challenged or even affected; [\"Dawn of the Dead\" is] just a gross-out.\" Leslie Halliwell of \"Halliwell's Film Guide\" stated that the film was \"occasionally laughable, otherwise sickening or boring.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" dismissed it as \"fake mayhem and not worth getting exercised about,\" adding: \"Here is a picture that anyone can walk out of with head held high and a clear and untroubled conscience.\"\nThe film is often cited as being one of the few sequels that are superior to the original. The film was selected as one of \"The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time\" by \"Empire\" magazine in 2008. It was also named as one of \"The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made\", a list published by \"The New York Times\". In 2016, James Charisma of \"Playboy\" ranked the film #10 on a list of \"15 Sequels That Are Way Better Than The Originals\". The 25th anniversary issue of \"Fangoria\" named it the best horror film of 1979 (although it was released a year earlier), and \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked it #27 on a list of \"The Top 50 Cult Films.\" Film.com and Filmsite.org rated it as one of the best films of 1978. In 2024, Paste Magazine ranked \"Dawn of the Dead\" number 8 on its list of the 100 greatest horror movies. Rotten Tomatoes lists the film on its 100 Best Zombie Movies, Ranked by Tomatometer.\nRemake.\nReleased in 2004, the remake of \"Dawn of the Dead\" was directed by Zack Snyder (in his directorial debut) and written by James Gunn. It stars Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, and Jake Weber with cameos from original cast members Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger, and Tom Savini.\nNovelization.\nGeorge Romero and Susanna Sparrow's paperback book based on the film was released in 1978. It was reissued, with a new introduction by Simon Pegg, on May 26, 2015, by Gallery Books. It was reissued again in November 2020, with Pegg's introduction and new artwork, as part of Second Sight Films' limited edition Blu-ray release of the film.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nReferences.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}

{"id": "65444", "revid": "34434225", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65444", "title": "Glenn Gould", "text": "Canadian pianist (1932\u20131982)\nGlenn Herbert Gould (; n\u00e9 Gold; 25 September 1932\u00a0\u2013 4 October 1982) was a Canadian classical pianist. Widely regarded as one of the greatest pianists of all time, he was renowned as an interpreter of the keyboard works of Johann Sebastian Bach. His playing was distinguished by remarkable technical proficiency and a capacity to articulate the contrapuntal texture of Bach's music.\nGould rejected most of the Romantic piano literature by Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, Rachmaninoff, and others, in favour of Bach and Beethoven mainly, along with some late-Romantic and modernist composers. Gould also recorded works by Haydn, Mozart, and Brahms; pre-Baroque composers such as Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, William Byrd, and Orlando Gibbons; and 20th-century composers including Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Alexander Scriabin and Richard Strauss.\nGould was also a writer and broadcaster, and dabbled in composing and conducting. He produced television programmes about classical music, in which he would speak and perform, or interact with an interviewer in a scripted manner. He made three \"musique concr\u00e8te\" radio documentaries, collectively the \"Solitude Trilogy\", about isolated areas of Canada. He was a prolific contributor to music journals, in which he discussed music theory. Gould was known for his eccentricities, ranging from his unorthodox musical interpretations and mannerisms at the keyboard to aspects of his lifestyle and behaviour. He disliked public performance, and stopped giving concerts at age 31 to concentrate on studio recording and media.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nGlenn Gould was born at home at 32 Southwood Drive in The Beaches, Toronto, on September 25, 1932, the only child of Russell Herbert Gold and Florence Emma Gold (born Greig, a distant relative of the Norwegian composer and pianist Edvard Grieg), Presbyterians of Scottish, English, German, and Norwegian ancestry. The family's surname was informally changed to Gould around 1939 to avoid being mistaken for Jewish, given the prevailing antisemitism of prewar Toronto. Gould had no Jewish ancestry, though he sometimes joked about it, saying, \"When people ask me if I'm Jewish, I always tell them that I was Jewish during the war.\"\nGould's interest in music and his talent as a pianist were evident very early. Both parents were musical; his mother, especially, encouraged his musical development from infancy. Hoping he would become a successful musician, she exposed him to music during her pregnancy. She taught him the piano and as a baby, he reportedly hummed instead of crying, and wiggled his fingers as if playing a keyboard instrument, leading his doctor to predict that he would \"be either a physician or a pianist\". He learned to read music before he could read words, and it was observed that he had perfect pitch at age three. When presented with a piano, the young Gould was reported to strike single notes and listen to their long decay, a practice his father Bert noted was different from typical children. Gould's interest in the piano was concomitant with an interest in composition. He played his pieces for family, friends, and sometimes large gatherings\u2014including, in 1938, a performance at the Emmanuel Presbyterian Church (a few blocks from the Gould family home) of one of his compositions.\nGould first heard a live musical performance by a celebrated soloist at age six. This profoundly affected him. He later described the experience:\nIt was Hofmann. It was, I think, his last performance in Toronto, and it was a staggering impression. The only thing I can really remember is that, when I was being brought home in a car, I was in that wonderful state of half-awakeness in which you hear all sorts of incredible sounds going through your mind. They were all orchestral sounds, but I was playing them all, and suddenly I was Hofmann. I was enchanted.\nAt age 10, he began attending the Toronto Conservatory of Music in Toronto (known since 1947 as The Royal Conservatory of Music). He studied music theory with Leo Smith, organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back as a result of a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is apocryphally related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould to sit up straight at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life, taking it with him almost everywhere. The chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low and allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of Guerrero's.\nGould developed a technique that enabled him to choose a very fast tempo while retaining the \"separateness\" and clarity of each note. His extremely low position at the instrument permitted him more control over the keyboard. Gould showed considerable technical skill in performing and recording a wide repertoire including virtuosic and romantic works, such as his own arrangement of Ravel's \"La valse\" and Liszt's transcriptions of Beethoven's Fifth and Sixth Symphonies. Gould worked from a young age with Guerrero on a technique known as finger-tapping: a method of training the fingers to act more independently from the arm.\nGould passed his final Conservatory examination in piano at age 12, achieving the highest marks of any candidate, and thus attaining professional standing as a pianist. One year later he passed the written theory exams, qualifying for an Associate of the Toronto Conservatory of Music (ATCM) diploma.\nGould's next-door neighbour as a child and lifelong best friend was Robert Fulford, who became a prominent journalist and essayist. In 1952, Fulford and Gould founded New Music Associates, which produced and promoted Gould's first three public performances, including Gould's debut performance of Bach's \"Goldberg Variations\".\nPiano.\nGould was a child prodigy and was described in adulthood as a musical phenomenon. He claimed to have almost never practised on the piano itself, preferring to study repertoire by reading, another technique he had learned from Guerrero. He may have spoken ironically about his practising though, as there is evidence that on occasion he did practise quite hard, sometimes using his own drills and techniques. He seemed able to practise mentally, once preparing for a recording of Brahms's piano works without playing them until a few weeks before the sessions. Gould could play a vast repertoire of piano music, as well as a wide range of orchestral and operatic transcriptions, from memory. He could \"memorize at sight\" and once challenged a friend to name any piece of music that he could not \"instantly play from memory\".\nThe piano, Gould said, \"is not an instrument for which I have any great love as such ... [but] I have played it all my life, and it is the best vehicle I have to express my ideas.\" In the case of Bach, Gould noted, \"[I] fixed the action in some of the instruments I play on\u2014and the piano I use for all recordings is now so fixed\u2014so that it is a shallower and more responsive action than the standard. It tends to have a mechanism which is rather like an automobile without power steering: you are in control and not it; it doesn't drive you, you drive it. This is the secret of doing Bach on the piano at all. You must have that immediacy of response, that control over fine definitions of things.\"\nAs a teenager, Gould was significantly influenced by Artur Schnabel and Rosalyn Tureck's recordings of Bach (which he called \"upright, with a sense of repose and positiveness\"), and the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gould was known for his vivid imagination. Listeners regarded his interpretations as ranging from brilliantly creative to outright eccentric. His pianism had great clarity and erudition, particularly in contrapuntal passages, and extraordinary control. Gould believed the piano to be \"a contrapuntal instrument\" and his whole approach to music was centered in the Baroque. Much of the homophony that followed he felt belongs to a less serious and less spiritual period of art.\nGould had a pronounced aversion to what he termed \"hedonistic\" approaches to piano repertoire, performance, and music generally. For him, \"hedonism\" in this sense denoted a superficial theatricality, something to which he felt Mozart, for example, became increasingly susceptible later in his career. He associated this drift toward hedonism with the emergence of a cult of showmanship and gratuitous virtuosity on the concert platform in the 19th century and later. The institution of the public concert, he felt, degenerated into the \"blood sport\" with which he struggled, and which he ultimately rejected.\nPerformances and recordings.\nOn 5 June 1938, at age five, Gould played in public for the first time, joining his family on stage to play piano at a church service at the Business Men's Bible Class in Uxbridge, Ontario, in front of a congregation of about 2,000. In 1945, at 13, he made his first appearance with an orchestra in a performance of the first movement of Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto with the Toronto Symphony. His first solo concert followed in 1947, and his first recital on radio was with the CBC in 1950. This was the beginning of Gould's long association with radio and recording. He founded the Festival Trio chamber group in 1953 and appeared at the inaugural Stratford Festival with cellist Isaac Mamott and violinist Albert Pratz.\nGould made his American debut on 2 January 1955, in Washington, D.C. at The Phillips Collection. The music critic Paul Hume wrote in the \"Washington Post\", \"January 2 is early for predictions, but it is unlikely that the year 1955 will bring us a finer piano recital than that played yesterday afternoon in the Phillips Gallery. We shall be lucky if it brings us others of equal beauty and significance.\" A performance at The Town Hall in New York City followed on 11 January. Gould's reputation quickly grew. \nAlso in 1955, Gould recorded J. S. Bach's Goldberg Variations. The recording built Gould's reputation both in North America and internationally and led to concert tours of Europe and the Soviet Union.\nIn 1957, he undertook a tour of the Soviet Union, becoming the first North American to play there since World War II. His concerts featured Bach, Beethoven, and the serial music of Schoenberg and Berg, which had been suppressed in the Soviet Union during the era of Socialist Realism. \nGould performed the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 3 with Herbert von Karajan conducting the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra in Berlin on 26 May, 1957. Gould debuted in Boston in 1958, playing for the Peabody Mason Concert Series. On 31 January 1960, Gould first appeared on American television on CBS's \"Ford Presents\" series, performing Bach's Keyboard Concerto No. 1 in D minor (BWV 1052) with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic. \nOn 7 August 1960, Gould and cellist Leonard Rose performed Beethoven's Cello and Piano Sonata No. 3 Op. 69 at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada. On the same program, Gould and Rose were joined by violinist Oscar Shumsky for a performance of Beethoven's Ghost Trio.\nOn 8 November 1960, Gould performed Beethoven's Emperor Concerto with the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Josef Krips. \nIn March 1961, Gould performed and recorded Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 4 with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.\nOn 1 and 4 March 1966, at Manhattan Center, in New York, Gould recorded Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 with Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra.\nAlthough Gould's live performances were outstandingly successful, he came to believe that the institution of the public concert was an anachronism and a \"force of evil\", leading to his early retirement from concert performance. He argued that public performance devolved into a sort of competition, with a non-empathetic audience mostly attendant to the possibility of the performer erring or failing critical expectation, and that such performances produced unexceptional interpretations because of the limitations of live music. He set forth this doctrine, half in jest, in \"GPAADAK\", the Gould Plan for the Abolition of Applause and Demonstrations of All Kinds. On 10 April 1964, he gave his last public performance, at Los Angeles's Wilshire Ebell Theater. Among the pieces he performed were Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 30, selections from Bach's \"The Art of Fugue\", and Hindemith's Piano Sonata No. 3. Gould performed fewer than 200 concerts, of which fewer than 40 were outside Canada. For a pianist such as Van Cliburn, 200 concerts would have amounted to about two years' touring.\nOne of Gould's reasons for abandoning live performance was his aesthetic preference for the recording studio, where, in his words, he developed a \"love affair with the microphone\". There, he could control every aspect of the final musical product by selecting parts of various takes. He felt that he could realize a musical score more fully this way. Gould felt strongly that there was little point in re-recording centuries-old pieces if the performer had no new perspective to bring. For the rest of his life, he eschewed live performance, focusing instead on recording, writing, and broadcasting.\nEccentricities.\nGould was widely known for his unusual habits. He often hummed or sang while he played, and his audio engineers were not always able to exclude his voice from recordings. Gould claimed that his singing was unconscious and increased in proportion to his inability to produce his intended interpretation on a given piano. It is likely that the habit originated in his having been taught by his mother to \"sing everything that he played\", as his biographer Kevin Bazzana wrote. This became \"an unbreakable (and notorious) habit\". Some of Gould's recordings were severely criticised because of this background \"vocalising\". For example, a reviewer of his 1981 of \"The Goldberg Variations\" wrote that many listeners would \"find the groans and croons intolerable\". Gould was known for his peculiar, even theatrical, gesticulations while playing. Another oddity was his insistence on absolute control over every aspect of his environment. The temperature of the recording studio had to be precisely regulated; he invariably insisted that it be extremely warm. According to another of Gould's biographers, Otto Friedrich, the air-conditioning engineer had to work just as hard as the recording engineers.\nThe piano had to be set at a certain height and would be raised on wooden blocks if necessary. A rug would sometimes be required for his feet. He had to sit exactly above the floor, and would play concerts only with the chair his father had made. He continued to use the chair even when its seat was completely worn, and became so closely identified with it that it is displayed in a glass case at Library and Archives Canada.\nConductors had mixed responses to Gould and his playing habits. George Szell, who led Gould in 1957 with the Cleveland Orchestra, remarked to his assistant, \"That nut's a genius.\" Leonard Bernstein said, \"There is nobody quite like him, and I just love playing with him.\" Bernstein created a stir at the concert of April 6, 1962, when, just before the New York Philharmonic was to perform the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor with Gould, he informed the audience that he was assuming no responsibility for what they were about to hear. He asked the audience: \"In a concerto, who is the boss\u00a0\u2013 the soloist or the conductor?\", to which the audience laughed. \"The answer is, of course, sometimes the one and sometimes the other, depending on the people involved.\" Specifically, Bernstein was referring to their rehearsals, with Gould's insistence that the entire first movement be played at half the indicated tempo. The speech was interpreted by Harold C. Schonberg, music critic for \"The New York Times\", as an abdication of responsibility and an attack on Gould. Plans for a studio recording of the performance came to nothing. The live radio broadcast was subsequently released on CD, Bernstein's disclaimer included.\nGould was averse to cold and wore heavy clothing (including gloves) even in warm places. He was once arrested, possibly being mistaken for a vagrant, while sitting on a park bench in Sarasota, Florida, dressed in his standard all-climate attire of coat, hat and mittens. He also disliked social functions. He hated being touched, and in later life limited personal contact, relying on the telephone and letters for communication. On a visit to Steinway Hall in New York City in 1959, the chief piano technician at the time, William Hupfer, greeted Gould with a slap on the back. Gould was shocked by this, and complained of aching, lack of coordination, and fatigue because of it. He went on to explore the possibility of litigation against Steinway &amp; Sons if his apparent injuries were permanent. He was known for cancelling performances at the last minute, which is why Bernstein's aforementioned public disclaimer opened with, \"Don't be frightened, Mr. Gould is here ... [he] will appear in a moment.\"\nIn his liner notes and broadcasts, Gould created more than two dozen alter egos for satirical, humorous, and didactic purposes, permitting him to write hostile reviews or incomprehensible commentaries on his own performances. Probably the best-known are the German musicologist Karlheinz Klopweisser, the English conductor Sir Nigel Twitt-Thornwaite, and the American critic Theodore Slutz. These facets of Gould, whether interpreted as neurosis or \"play\", have provided ample material for psychobiography.\nGould was a teetotaller and did not smoke. He did not cook; instead he often ate at restaurants and relied on room service. He ate one meal a day, supplemented by arrowroot biscuits and coffee. In his later years he claimed to be vegetarian, though this is not certain.\nIn 1979 Gould narrated and appeared in a humorous episode of the CBC Television series Cities in which he takes the audience on a sampling tour of Toronto, including a number of places he had never been to before.\nPersonal life.\nGould lived a private life. The documentary filmmaker Bruno Monsaingeon said of him: \"No supreme pianist has ever given of his heart and mind so overwhelmingly while showing himself so sparingly.\" He never married, and biographers have spent considerable time on his sexuality. Bazzana writes that \"it is tempting to assume that Gould was asexual, an image that certainly fits his aesthetic and the persona he sought to convey, and one can read the whole Gould literature and be convinced that he died a virgin\"\u2014but he also mentions that evidence points to \"a number of relationships with women that may or may not have been platonic and ultimately became complicated and were ended\".\nOne piece of evidence arrived in 2007. When Gould was in Los Angeles in 1956, he met Cornelia Foss, an art instructor, and her husband Lukas, a conductor. After several years, she and Gould became lovers. In 1967, she left her husband for Gould, taking her two children with her to Toronto. She purchased a house near Gould's apartment. In 2007, Foss confirmed that she and Gould had had a love affair for several years. According to her, \"There were a lot of misconceptions about Glenn, and it was partly because he was so very private. But I assure you, he was an extremely heterosexual man. Our relationship was, among other things, quite sexual.\" Their affair lasted until 1972, when she returned to her husband. As early as two weeks after leaving her husband, Foss noticed disturbing signs in Gould, alluding to unusual behaviour that was more than \"just neurotic\". Specifically, he believed that \"someone was spying on him\", according to Foss's son.\nHealth and death.\nThough an admitted hypochondriac, Gould had many pains and ailments, but his autopsy revealed few underlying problems in areas that often troubled him. He worried about everything from high blood pressure (which in his later years he recorded in diary form) to the safety of his hands. (Gould rarely shook people's hands, and habitually wore gloves.) The spine injury he experienced as a child led physicians to prescribe, usually independently, an assortment of analgesics, anxiolytics, and other drugs. Bazzana has speculated that Gould's increasing use of a variety of prescription medications over his career may have had a deleterious effect on his health. It had reached the stage, Bazzana writes, that \"he was taking pills to counteract the side effects of other pills, creating a cycle of dependency\". In 1956, Gould told photojournalist Jock Carroll about \"my hysteria about eating. It's getting worse all the time.\" In his biography, psychiatrist Peter F. Ostwald noted Gould's increasing neurosis about food in the mid-1950s, something Gould had spoken to him about. Ostwald later discussed the possibility that Gould had developed a \"psychogenic eating disorder\" around this time. In 1956, Gould was also taking Thorazine, an anti-psychotic medication, and reserpine, another anti-psychotic, which can also be used to lower blood pressure. Cornelia Foss has said that Gould took many antidepressants, which she blamed for his deteriorating mental state.\nWhether Gould's behaviour fell within the autism spectrum has been debated. The diagnosis was first suggested by psychiatrist Peter Ostwald, a friend of Gould's, in the 1997 book \"Glenn Gould: The Ecstasy and Tragedy of Genius\". There has also been speculation that he may have had bipolar disorder, because he sometimes went several days without sleep, had extreme increases in energy, drove recklessly, and in later life endured severe depressive episodes.\nOn 27 September 1982, two days after his 50th birthday, after experiencing a severe headache, Gould had a stroke that paralyzed the left side of his body. He was admitted to Toronto General Hospital and his condition rapidly deteriorated. By 4 October, there was evidence of brain damage, and Gould's father decided that his son should be taken off life support. Gould's public funeral was held in St. Paul's Anglican Church on 15 October with singing by Lois Marshall and Maureen Forrester. The service was attended by over 3,000 people and was broadcast on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. He is buried next to his parents in Toronto's Mount Pleasant Cemetery (section 38, lot 1050). The first few bars of the \"Goldberg Variations\" are carved on his grave marker. An animal lover, Gould left half his estate to the Toronto Humane Society; the other half went to the Salvation Army.\nIn 2000, a movement disorder neurologist suggested in a paper that Gould had dystonia, \"a problem little understood in his time.\"\nPerspectives.\nWritings.\nGould periodically told interviewers he would have been a writer if he had not been a pianist. He expounded his criticism and philosophy of music and art in lectures, convocation speeches, periodicals, and CBC radio and television documentaries. Gould participated in many interviews, and had a predilection for scripting them to the extent that they may be seen to be as written work as much as off-the-cuff discussions. Gould's writing style was highly articulate, but sometimes florid, indulgent, and rhetorical. This is especially evident in his (frequent) attempts at humour and irony. Bazzana writes that although some of Gould's \"conversational dazzle\" found its way into his prolific written output, his writing was \"at best uneven [and] at worst awful\". While offering \"brilliant insights\" and \"provocative theses\", Gould's writing is often marred by \"long, tortuous sentences\" and a \"false formality\", Bazzana writes.\nIn his writing, Gould praised certain composers and rejected what he deemed banal in music composition and its consumption by the public, and also gave analyses of the music of Richard Strauss, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Despite a certain affection for Dixieland jazz, Gould was mostly averse to popular music. He enjoyed a jazz concert with his friends as a youth, mentioned jazz in his writings, and once criticized the Beatles for \"bad voice leading\"\u2014while praising Petula Clark and Barbra Streisand. Gould and jazz pianist Bill Evans were mutual admirers, and Evans made his record \"Conversations with Myself\" using Gould's Steinway model CD 318 piano.\nOn art.\nGould's perspective on art is often summed up by this 1962 quotation: \"The justification of art is the internal combustion it ignites in the hearts of men and not its shallow, externalized, public manifestations. The purpose of art is not the release of a momentary ejection of adrenaline but is, rather, the gradual, lifelong construction of a state of wonder and serenity.\"\nGould repeatedly called himself \"the last puritan\", a reference to the philosopher George Santayana's 1935 novel of the same name. But he was progressive in many ways, promulgating the atonal composers of the early 20th century, and anticipating, through his deep involvement in the recording process, the vast changes technology had on the production and distribution of music. Mark Kingwell summarizes the paradox, never resolved by Gould nor his biographers, this way:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;He was progressive and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both a critic of the \"Zeitgeist\" and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. We should see this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and was not a man of his time.\nTechnology.\nThe issue of \"authenticity\" in relation to an approach like Gould's has been greatly debated (although less so by the end of the 20th century): is a recording less authentic or \"direct\" for having been highly refined by technical means in the studio? Gould likened his process to that of a film director\u2014one knows that a two-hour film was not made in two hours\u2014and implicitly asked why the recording of music should be different. He went so far as to conduct an experiment with musicians, sound engineers, and laypeople in which they were to listen to a recording and determine where the splices occurred. Each group chose different points, but none was wholly successful. While the test was hardly scientific, Gould remarked, \"The tape does lie, and nearly always gets away with it\".\nIn the lecture and essay \"Forgery and Imitation in the Creative Process\", one of his most significant texts, Gould makes explicit his views on authenticity and creativity. He asks why the epoch in which a work is received influences its reception as \"art\", postulating a sonata of his own composition that sounds so like one of Haydn's that it is received as such. If, instead, the sonata had been attributed to an earlier or later composer, it becomes more or less interesting as a piece of music. Yet it is not the work that has changed but its relation within the accepted narrative of music history. Similarly, Gould notes the \"pathetic duplicity\" in the reception of high-quality forgeries by Han van Meegeren of new paintings attributed to the Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, before and after the forgery was known.\nGould preferred an ahistorical, or at least pre-Renaissance, view of art, minimizing the identity of the artist and the attendant historical context in evaluating the artwork: \"What gives us the right to assume that in the work of art we must receive a direct communication with the historical attitudes of another period? ... moreover, what makes us assume that the situation of the man who wrote it accurately or faithfully reflects the situation of his time? ... What if the composer, as historian, is faulty?\"\nRecordings.\nStudio.\nIn creating music, Gould much preferred the control and intimacy provided by the recording studio. He disliked the concert hall, which he compared to a competitive sporting arena. He gave his final public performance in 1964, and thereafter devoted his career to the studio, recording albums and several radio documentaries. He was attracted to the technical aspects of recording, and considered the manipulation of tape to be another part of the creative process. Although Gould's recording studio producers have testified that \"he needed splicing less than most performers\", Gould used the process to give himself total artistic control over the recording process. He recounted his recording of the A minor fugue from Book I of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" and how it was spliced together from two takes, with the fugue's expositions from one take and its episodes from another.\nGould's first commercial recording (of Berg's Piano sonata, Op. 1) came in 1953 on the short-lived Canadian Hallmark label. He soon signed with Columbia Records' classical music division and, in 1955, recorded \"\", his breakthrough work. Although there was some controversy at Columbia about the appropriateness of this \"debut\" piece, the record received extraordinary praise and was among the best-selling classical music albums of its era. Gould became closely associated with the piece, playing it in full or in part at many recitals. A new recording of the \"Goldberg Variations\", in 1981, was among his last albums; the piece was one of a few he recorded twice in the studio. The 1981 release was one of CBS Masterworks' first digital recordings. The 1955 interpretation is highly energetic and often frenetic; the later is slower and more deliberate\u2014Gould wanted to treat the aria and its 30 variations as a cohesive whole.\nGould said Bach was \"first and last an architect, a constructor of sound, and what makes him so inestimably valuable to us is that he was beyond a doubt the greatest architect of sound who ever lived\". He recorded most of Bach's other keyboard works, including both books of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" and the partitas, French Suites, English Suites, inventions and sinfonias, keyboard concertos, and a number of toccatas (which interested him least, being less polyphonic). For his only recording at the organ, he recorded some of \"The Art of Fugue\", which was also released posthumously on piano.\nAs for Beethoven, Gould preferred the composer's early and late periods. He recorded all five of the piano concertos, collaborating with Vladimir Golschmann and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra (members of the New York Philharmonic) on No. 1, with Leonard Bernstein and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra (members of the New York Philharmonic) on Nos. 2 and 3, with Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra on No. 4, and with Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony Orchestra on No. 5. He also recorded 22 of the piano sonatas, and numerous bagatelles and variations. Gould was the first pianist to record any of Liszt's piano transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies (beginning with the Fifth Symphony, in 1967, with the Sixth released in 1969).\nGould also recorded works by Brahms, Mozart, and many other prominent piano composers, though he was outspoken in his criticism of the Romantic era as a whole. He was extremely critical of Chopin. When asked whether he found himself wanting to play Chopin, he replied: \"No, I don't. I play it in a weak moment\u2014maybe once a year or twice a year for myself. But it doesn't convince me.\" But in 1970, he played Chopin's B minor sonata for the CBC and said he liked some of the miniatures and \"sort of liked the first movement of the B minor\".\nAlthough he recorded all of Mozart's sonatas and admitted enjoying the \"actual playing\" of them, Gould said he disliked Mozart's later works. He was fond of a number of lesser-known composers such as Orlando Gibbons, whose \"Anthems\" he had heard as a teenager, and whose music he felt a \"spiritual attachment\" to. He recorded a number of Gibbons's keyboard works, and called him his favourite composer, despite his better-known admiration for Bach. He made recordings of piano music by Jean Sibelius (the Sonatines and \"Kyllikki\"), Georges Bizet (the \"Variations Chromatiques de Concert\" and the \"Premier nocturne\"), Richard Strauss (the Piano Sonata, the Five Pieces, and \"Enoch Arden\" with Claude Rains), and Hindemith (the three piano sonatas and the sonatas for brass and piano). He also made recordings of Schoenberg's complete piano works. In early September 1982, Gould made his final recording: Strauss's Piano Sonata in B minor.\nCollaborations.\nThe success of Gould's collaborations was to a degree dependent upon his collaborators' receptiveness to his sometimes unconventional readings of the music. The musicologist Michael Stegemann considered Gould's television collaboration with American violinist Yehudi Menuhin in 1965, in which they played works by Bach, Beethoven and Schoenberg, a success because \"Menuhin was ready to embrace the new perspectives opened up by an unorthodox view\". But Stegemann deemed the 1966 collaboration with soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, recording Strauss's \"Ophelia Lieder\", an \"outright fiasco\". Schwarzkopf believed in \"total fidelity\" to the score, and objected to the temperature:\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Template:Blockquote/styles.css\" /&gt;The studio was incredibly overheated, which may be good for a pianist but not for a singer: a dry throat is the end as far as singing is concerned. But we persevered nonetheless. It wasn't easy for me. Gould began by improvising something Straussian\u2014we thought he was simply warming up, but no, he continued to play like that throughout the actual recordings, as though Strauss's notes were just a pretext that allowed him to improvise freely.\nGould recorded Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Ernst Krenek with numerous vocalists, including Donald Gramm and Ellen Faull. He also recorded Bach's six sonatas for violin and harpsichord (BWV 1014\u20131019) with Jaime Laredo, and the three sonatas for viola da gamba and keyboard with Leonard Rose. Claude Rains narrated their recording of Strauss's melodrama \"Enoch Arden\". Gould also collaborated with members of the New York Philharmonic, the flutist Julius Baker and the violinist Rafael Druian, in a recording of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 4, and with Leopold Stokowski and the American Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 5 in 1966.\nGould collaborated extensively with Vladimir Golschmann and the Columbia Symphony Orchestra for the Columbia Masterworks label in his recording of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 in 1958 and several works by Bach in the 1960s, including the Keyboard Concerto No. 3 (BWV 1054), the Keyboard Concerto No. 5 (BWV 1056) and the Keyboard Concerto No. 7 (BWV 1058) in 1967 and the Keyboard Concerto No. 2 in E major (BWV 1053) and the Keyboard Concerto No. 4 in A major (BWV 1055) in 1969.\nDocumentaries.\nGould made numerous television and radio programs for CBC Television and CBC Radio. Notable productions include his \"musique concr\u00e8te\" \"Solitude Trilogy\", which consists of \"The Idea of North\", a meditation on Northern Canada and its people; \"The Latecomers\", about Newfoundland; and \"The Quiet in the Land\", about Mennonites in Manitoba. All three use a radiophonic electronic-music technique that Gould called \"contrapuntal radio\", in which several people are heard speaking at once\u2014much like the voices in a fugue\u2014manipulated through overdubbing and editing. His experience of driving across northern Ontario while listening to Top 40 radio in 1967 inspired one of his most unusual radio pieces, \"The Search for Petula Clark\", a witty and eloquent dissertation on Clark's recordings.\nAlso among Gould's CBC programs was an educational lecture on the music of Bach, \"Glenn Gould On Bach\", which featured a collaborative performance with Julius Baker and Oscar Shumsky of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 5.\nTranscriptions, compositions, and conducting.\nGould was also a prolific transcriber of orchestral repertoire for piano. He transcribed his own Wagner and Ravel recordings, as well as Strauss's operas and Schubert's and Bruckner's symphonies, which he played privately for pleasure.\nGould dabbled in composition, with few finished works. As a teenager, he wrote chamber music and piano works in the style of the Second Viennese School. Significant works include a string quartet, which he finished in his 20s (published 1956, recorded 1960), and his cadenzas to Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1. Later works include the Lieberson Madrigal (soprano, alto, tenor, bass [SATB] and piano), and \"So You Want to Write a Fugue?\" (SATB with piano or string-quartet accompaniment). His String Quartet (Op. 1) received a mixed reaction: \"The Christian Science Monitor\" and \"Saturday Review\" were quite laudatory, the \"Montreal Star\" less so. There is little critical commentary on Gould's compositions because there are few of them; he never succeeded beyond Opus 1, and left a number of works unfinished. He attributed his failure as a composer to his lack of a \"personal voice\". Most of his work is published by Schott Music. The recording \"Glenn Gould: The Composer\" contains his original works.\nTowards the end of his life, Gould began conducting. He had earlier directed Bach's \"Brandenburg Concerto No. 5\" and the cantata \"Widerstehe doch der S\u00fcnde\" from the harpsipiano (a piano with metal hammers to simulate a harpsichord's sound), and Gustav Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (the \"Urlicht\" section) in the 1960s. His first known public appearance conducting occurred in 1939 when he was six, while appearing as a pianist in a concert for the Business Men's Bible Class in Uxbridge. By 1957 he emerged as the conductor for the CBC Television program \"Chrysler Festival\", in which he collaborated with Maureen Forrester. In the same year he also joined forces with the CBC Vancouver Orchestra as a conductor in a radio broadcast of Mozart's Symphony No. 1 and Schubert's Symphony No. 4 (\"Tragic\").\nIn 1958, Gould wrote to Golschmann of his \"temporary retirement\" from conducting, apparently as a result of the unanticipated muscular strain it created. Gould found himself \"practically crippled\" after his conducting appearances and unable to perform properly at the piano. Yet even at the age of 26, Gould continued to contemplate retiring as a piano soloist and devoting himself entirely to conducting. Immediately before his death, he was finalizing plans to appear as a conductor of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1982 and in recordings of Mendelssohn's \"Hebrides Overture\" and Beethoven's \"Coriolan Overture\" in 1983. His last recording as a conductor was of Wagner's \"Siegfried Idyll\" in its original chamber-music scoring. He intended to spend his later years conducting, writing about music, and composing while pursuing an idyllic \"neoThoreauvian way of life\" in the countryside.\nLegacy and honours.\nGould is one of the most acclaimed musicians of the 20th century. His unique pianistic method, insight into the architecture of compositions, and relatively free interpretation of scores created performances and recordings that were revelatory to many listeners and highly objectionable to others. Philosopher Mark Kingwell wrote, \"his influence is made inescapable. No performer after him can avoid the example he sets ... Now, everyone must perform \"through\" him: he can be emulated or rejected, but he cannot be ignored.\" Among the pianists who acknowledged Gould's influence are Andr\u00e1s Schiff, Zolt\u00e1n Kocsis, Ivo Pogoreli\u0107, and Peter Serkin. Artists influenced by Gould include painter George Condo.\nOne of Gould's performances of the Prelude and Fugue in C major from Book II of \"The Well-Tempered Clavier\" was chosen for inclusion on the NASA Voyager Golden Record by a committee headed by Carl Sagan. The record was placed on the spacecrafts \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\". On 25 August 2012, Voyager 1 became the first to cross the heliopause and enter the interstellar medium.\nGould is a popular subject of biography and critical analysis. Philosophers such as Kingwell and Giorgio Agamben have interpreted his life and ideas. References to Gould and his work are plentiful in poetry, fiction, and the visual arts. Fran\u00e7ois Girard's Genie Award-winning 1993 film \"Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould\" includes interviews with people who knew him, dramatizations of scenes from his life, and fanciful segments including an animation set to music. Thomas Bernhard's 1983 novel \"The Loser\" purports to be an extended first-person essay about Gould and his lifelong friendship with two fellow students from the Mozarteum school in Salzburg, both of whom have abandoned their careers as concert pianists due to the intimidating example of Gould's genius. The 2009 documentary film \"\", by Peter Raymont and Mich\u00e8le Hozer, also examines Gould's private and creative life, including his relationship with Foss.\nGould left an extensive body of work beyond the keyboard. After retiring from concertising, he was increasingly interested in other media, including audio and film documentary and writing, through which he mused on aesthetics, composition, music history, and the effect of the electronic age on media consumption. (Gould grew up in Toronto at the same time that Canadian theorists Marshall McLuhan, Northrop Frye, and Harold Innis were making their mark on communications studies.) Anthologies of Gould's writing and letters have been published, and Library and Archives Canada holds a significant portion of his papers.\nIn 1983, Gould was posthumously inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. He was inducted into Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto in 1998, and designated a National Historic Person in 2012. Both his childhood home and his longtime apartment on Saint Clair Avenue West bear Heritage Toronto plaques honouring his life, and a federal plaque was erected next to a sculpture of him in downtown Toronto. The Glenn Gould Studio at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre in Toronto was named after him. To commemorate what would have been Gould's 75th birthday, the Canadian Museum of Civilization held an exhibition, \"Glenn Gould: The Sounds of Genius\", in 2007. The multimedia exhibit was held in conjunction with Library and Archives Canada.\nGlenn Gould Foundation.\nThe Glenn Gould Foundation was established in Toronto in 1983 to honour Gould and keep alive his memory and life's work. The foundation's mission \"is to extend awareness of the legacy of Glenn Gould as an extraordinary musician, communicator, and Canadian, and to advance his visionary and innovative ideas into the future\", and its prime activity is the triennial awarding of the Glenn Gould Prize to \"an individual who has earned international recognition as the result of a highly exceptional contribution to music and its communication, through the use of any communications technologies.\" The prize consists of CA$ and the responsibility of awarding the CA$ Glenn Gould Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Prize to a young musician of the winner's choice.\nGlenn Gould School.\nThe Royal Conservatory of Music Professional School in Toronto adopted the name The Glenn Gould School in 1997 after its most famous alumnus.\nAwards.\nGould received many honours both during his lifetime and posthumously. He was awarded the 1969 Molson Prize, then worth C$15,000. In 1970, the Canadian government offered him the Companion of the Order of Canada, but he declined, believing himself too young.\nJuno Awards.\nThe Juno Awards are presented annually by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Gould won three, accepting one in person.\nGrammy Awards.\nThe Grammys are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Gould won four and, as with the Junos, accepted one in person. In 1983 he was inducted posthumously into the Grammy Hall of Fame for his 1955 recording of the \"Goldberg Variations\".\nReferences.\nFootnotes\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nCitations.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

{"id": "65448", "revid": "2927383", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=65448", "title": "Invisible ink", "text": "Substance used for writing which is invisible and can later be made visible\nInvisible ink, also known as security ink or sympathetic ink, is a substance used for writing, which is invisible either on application or soon thereafter, and can later be made visible by some means, such as heat or ultraviolet light. Invisible ink is one form of steganography.\nHistory.\nOne of the earliest writers to mention an invisible ink is Aeneas Tacticus, in the 4th century BC. He mentions it in discussing how to survive under siege but does not indicate the type of ink to be used. This was part of his list of the 20 different methods of secret communications in a book called \"On the Defense of Fortifications\". One of the techniques that involved steganography involved puncturing a tiny hole above or below letters in a document to spell out a secret message. This did not include an invisible ink but the Germans improved on the method during World War I and World War II. They used invisible ink and microdots instead of pinpricks.\nPhilo of Byzantium may be the first writer known to describe an invisible ink using a reagent around 217\u2013218 BC, with oak galls and vitriol. These ingredients were used to make oak gall ink. People soon discovered that they could write invisibly with one of the ingredients and then cause the writing to appear by adding the other. Pliny the Elder and the Roman poet Ovid gave advice on the use of plant juices and milk to write secret messages.\nLemons were also used as organic inks by Arabs around 600AD, and during the 16th century in Europe.\nGiovanni Battista della Porta is credited with the first recipe for a sympathetic ink, derived from alum and vinegar, as well as the first book on secret writing and invisible inks, (1558, 1589). Since then, a wide variety of invisible inks have been used for all sorts of secretive purposes. A formula similar to oak gall ink was created by James Jay and used by George Washington and the Culper Spy Ring during the American Revolution and lemon juice was used by the 'Lemon Juice Spies' (Carl Muller and four other Germans, who all died for their efforts either by suicide or execution, along with John Hahn, an English baker) during World War I. In World War II, neutral or acidic solutions of phenolphthalein, a chemical compound extracted from pills for constipation, were used as invisible ink. It is colorless but turns pink when exposed to alkali such as ammonia and bicarbonate soda.\nGeneral application and use.\nInvisible ink can be applied to a writing surface with a specialty purpose stylus, stamp, fountain pen, toothpick, calligraphy pen, Cotton swab, or even a finger dipped in the liquid. Once dry, the written surface looks as if it were blank, with a similar texture and reflectivity as the surrounding surface.\nThe ink can be later made visible by different methods according to the type of invisible ink used. The ink may be revealed by heat or by application of an appropriate chemical, or it may be made visible by viewing under ultraviolet light. Inks which are developed by a chemical reaction may depend on an acid-base reaction (like litmus paper), reactions similar to the blueprint process, or any of hundreds of others. Developer fluids may be applied using a spray bottle, but some developers are in the form of vapor, e.g. ammonia fumes used to develop phenolphthalein ink.\nThere are also toy invisible ink pens which have two tips\u2014one tip for invisible ink writing, and another tip for developing the ink. Invisible ink is sometimes used to print parts of pictures or text in books for children to play with, always including a \"decoder pen\" which is used to show the invisible parts of texts or pictures, thus revealing answers to questions printed in regular ink or completing missing parts of pictures.\nSecurity marker pens or UV markers with fluorescent ink that glows when illuminated with a UV light is often used to invisibly mark valuable household items in case of burglary. There are specialty security maker pens formulated for writing on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastic, metal, etc. The mark can be read by using a blacklight or other UV light source. Security marker pens can be obtained commercially and are widely used as a crime countermeasure.\nSome commercially available invisible inks glow very brightly, in a variety of colors, under ultraviolet light. This makes them suitable for use in readmission such as hand stamping.\nThere are some invisible ink types that can only be invisible when applied to certain types of surfaces, but are still visible on others.\nSome vendors now offer invisible ink for use in computer inkjet printers. Such inks are usually visible under ultraviolet light. Typical uses include printing information on business forms for use by the form processor, without cluttering up the visible contents of the form. For example, some United States Postal Service mail sorting stations use UV-visible ink to print bar codes on mailed envelopes giving routing information for use by mail handling equipment further down the line before delivery.\nAn E2E voting system called Scantegrity II uses invisible ink to enable the voter to obtain a confirmation code only for the voted selection.\nProperties of an \"ideal\" invisible ink.\nWhat an \"ideal\" invisible ink is depends on its intended use. For example, property marking should ideally be done with ink easily read under ultraviolet light, whereas in espionage such an ink would be considered too easily detectable since a large number of letters may be screened relatively quickly using UV light.\nInvisible inks are inherently \"insecure\" against a determined and well-equipped inspector, which must be balanced against the logistical difficulty in carrying out mass-screening of posted mail. It is easier to perform large-scale undetected screening of millions of electronic communications, than to mass-screen even a small fraction of conventional mail. Apart from in dictatorships where large numbers of personnel are employed to spy on fellow nationals, screening of posted mail is only feasible in particular situations, such as letters to and from a particular suspect or facility.\nThe British SOE training manual used in the Second World War identified the following properties of an \"ideal\" invisible ink:\nFrom practical experience \"6\" and \"9\" were usually incompatible. SOE agents were trained not to risk their lives through reliance on insecure inks, most of which were from World War I. In general, SOE used invisible inks as a back-up method of communication when other, more secure communication techniques were unavailable. The agency was known to supply special inks to its field agents, rather than have them depend upon improvisation from obtainable everyday chemicals. When agents were forced to improvise, they were advised to dilute their invisible ink as much as possible to reduce chances of detection.\nScreening letters for secret messages.\nAny invisible ink can be made visible by someone who is sufficiently determined, but the limitation is generally time available and the fact that one cannot apply hours of effort to every single piece of paper. Thus successful use of invisible ink depends on not arousing suspicion that invisible ink may be present.\nTelltale signs of invisible ink, such as pen scratches from a sharp pen, roughness, or changed reflectivity of the paper (either more dull or more shiny, usually from using undiluted ink), can be obvious to a careful observer who simply makes use of strong light, a magnifying glass and their nose. Also, key words in the visible letter, such as \"heat\" or any other odd code name, in an out of place context may alert a censor to the presence of invisible ink. Invisible ink is not effective with glossy or very smooth paper types, since the sizing of these papers prevents ink from being absorbed deep into the paper and it is easily visible, especially if the paper is examined under glancing light. There are, however, commercially available inks for non-porous surfaces that are only visible under ultraviolet light and are otherwise virtually invisible on such surfaces.\nUsing either ultraviolet light or an iodine fume cupboard, messages can be quickly screened for invisible ink and also read without first permanently developing the invisible ink. Thus, if a censor uses this method to intercept messages, the letter may then be sent to the intended recipient, who will be unaware that the secret message has already been intercepted by a third party.\nA \"screening station\" theoretically could involve visual and olfactory inspection, an examination under ultraviolet light and then the heating of all objects in an oven before finally trying exposure to iodine fumes to produce optimal security in optimal time.\nInvisible ink types.\nFor practical reasons, the inks are listed here according to their method of development. It must be understood however that some inks \u2013 particularly those of organic origin or those consisting of a mixture of several chemicals \u2013 may be made visible by several methods. For example, invisible writing with soap water may be made visible either by heat, reaction with phenolphthalein, viewing under ultraviolet light, or by placing the page inside an iodine fume cupboard.\nInks developed by heat.\nSome of these are organic substances that oxidize when heated, which usually turns them brown. For this type of \"heat fixed\" ink, any acidic fluid will work. The most secure way to use any of the following substances for invisible ink is by dilution, usually with water, close to the point when they become difficult to develop.\nThe writing is rendered visible by heating the paper, either on a radiator, by ironing it, using a hair dryer, or by placing it in an oven. A 100-watt light bulb is less likely to damage the paper.\nInks developed by chemical reaction.\nIn most cases, these substance changes color when mixed with an acid or base.\nInks visible under ultraviolet light.\nSome inks glow faintly (fluoresce) when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is a property of many substances, particularly organic substances and body fluids.\nOther inks work in a near opposite way by absorbing ultraviolet light but without fluorescing. When these are used on fluorescent paper, the inked areas fluoresce less than the surrounding paper area when under an ultraviolet lamp. This is especially a property of inks with a yellow tint.\nSome UV-visible inks may be detected on a photocopy, due to the relatively strong ultraviolet component in light from the photocopier scanning head.\nExamples of inks revealed by ultraviolet light are:\nInks which alter the surface of paper.\nThis includes virtually all invisible inks, but pure distilled water can also be used in this way. Application of any fluid will alter the paper surface fibers or sizing.\nFumes created from heating iodine crystals will develop the writing, which will appear brown because the iodine sticks preferentially to the altered areas of the paper. Exposing the paper to strong sunlight will return the writing to its invisible state, as will using a bleach solution.\nSlightly dampening paper with a sponge or by steam and then drying it before writing a message will prevent writing from being developed by this method, but overdoing dampening will result in telltale paper cockling.\nModern usage.\nFormer MI6 agent Richard Tomlinson stated that Pentel Rolling Writer rollerball pens were extensively used by MI-6 agents to produce secret writing in the form of invisible messages while on missions.\nIn 2002, a gang was indicted for spreading a riot between federal penitentiaries using coded telephone messages, and messages in invisible ink.\nUnited States declassification of invisible ink recipes.\nIn 1995, President Clinton issued an executive order requesting that all agencies declassify information 25 years or older by the year 2000. Six World War I documents referencing the recipes for invisible ink were due to be declassified under this order, including:\nIn 1999, however, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) successfully exempted these documents, arguing that the recipes provided the basis for more advanced formulas still in use at the time. This exemption made the recipes for invisible ink the oldest classified documents held by the National Archives until their declassification in 2011. At this time, the CIA no longer considered the documents sensitive due to recent advancements in technology.\nInvisible ink in art.\nInvisible ink is not commonly used in art. Some artists, however, have incorporated invisible ink into their work, either alone or in conjunction with more conventional media.\nJean-Michel Basquiat is known to have worked with invisible ink. In 2012, Sotheby's London discovered Basquiat's signature painted in invisible ink on the 1982 work, \"Orange Sports Figure\". In 2018, analysis by an art conservator revealed invisible ink markings on an untitled Basquiat painting from 1981.\nIn 2012, the Hayward Gallery exhibition, \"Invisible: Art about the Unseen, 1957-2012\", included the 1989 work, \"Magic Ink\", by Gianni Motti. It consisted of two drawings created with undeveloped invisible ink.\nIn 2015, Aowen Jin exhibited artwork drawn in invisible ink at the Horniman Museum in London. The illustrations, drawn on the walls and floor of the Music Gallery Performance Space, were only visible under UV light.\nInvisible ink online.\nIn addition to traditional chemical methods, modern digital techniques utilize Unicode characters to create invisible text, enabling hidden messages within standard text formats.\nDisappearing inks.\nInks that are visible for a period of time without the intention of being made visible again are called disappearing inks. They typically rely on the chemical reaction between thymolphthalein and a basic substance such as sodium hydroxide. Thymolphthalein is normally colorless, but turns blue in solution with the base. As the base reacts with carbon dioxide (always present in the air), the pH drops below 10.5 and the color disappears. Pens are also available whose inks can be thoroughly erased by swiping a special pen over the original text. Disappearing inks have been used in gag squirtguns, for limited-time secret messages, for security reasons on non-reusable passes, for fraudulent purposes, and for dress-making and other crafts where measurement marks are required to disappear.\nReferences.\nNotes.\n&lt;templatestyles src=\"Reflist/styles.css\" /&gt;"}
